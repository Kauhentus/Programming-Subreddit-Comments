Finally got serious and figured out *virtualenv*. All I can say is it's about time. Like many "mysteries" it takes about 15 minutes of reading the getting started page to do the basic stuff perfectly well.
Thank you!
I've tried it and it feels slower than pycharm
You use IDLE at work?
I use IDLE AT work, I don't use IDLE FOR work.
Check the FAQ
GitHub link?
Yes. 
I don't know what this means
Bad bot
Put your code on GitHub so others may easily enjoy your cassette creation program :)
What do you use FOR work, if you dont mind?
Uh, excel, word, geosystem... I'm not in any sort of work related to coding. 
Perfect, so i don't need to do anything special in the functions that return those globals. Thank you.
I haven‘t done that part yet, but instead of sessions simply use tokens. Have an endpoint that consumes the username and password and if correct return a unique, random and unguessable token to the client. The client should then send this token to the backend with every subsequent request, e.g. in the Authorization header so you don‘t need to pollute your JSON objects. Of course you need to keep track of these tokens (which user owns which token etc.) and they should be invalidated properly. Very similar to sessions. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) have emerged as the de facto standard for this, but there are other approaches as well.

How?
Weird. I develop and deploy on both linux and windows. As far as results and the work it takes to get them, I haven't noticed much of a difference between environments.
Interesting 
What sort of development do you do, and what does your Windows development environment look like?
yeah it's insanely messy - system installation, default install and then macports. Basically worst practice, I know lol. However, if I were to start fresh would you recommend going with Brew to install 2.7 and 3 and then use virtualenv?
for doing everything scratch
That sounds reasonable. Thanks for providing this point of view -- maybe I do need to adjust my stance a bit :) . Out of curiosity, are you never missing the standard unix tools like, say, `grep` and the ways the unix tools generally play together? And do you find that third-party tools and libraries generally work well in a Windows environment? I have to admit I don't have much experience with PowerShell myself.
I've used nameko before. I love it, but I don't like how dependency injection works thoe, there some magic involved into it. P.S: what i call magic is what a ide can't pickup or understand, even if i can tell what's happening myself.
Doesn't matter. vscode is the G.O.A.T. editor and is on all OSs and git will convert your newlines automagically.
Wish I could square upvote this
Can you explain a bit more?
But that's a list comprehension, a generator would be: sizes = (x**2 for x in range(10)) That being said, either would work just as well for this case. Even better than that would be: If not (count**0.5).isinteger(): #not a square
On a high level, it attempts to answer questions on freerice.com by randomly clicking on the answers as the questions come up. Unfortunately, its not very good at its job, so it can only get about 1/4 answers right on average. :^) Behind the scenes, it's just running Selenium-Python hooked up to the Random library. Nothing special.
Really good and clean code!
&gt; The network makes use of a few new experimental concepts (which i will not disclose at the moment...) security through obscurity?

Look for the free and legal online version of Automate the Boring Stuff book. Also checkout Python Crash Course. Look at what textnooks universities use and grab a previous edition for cheap. So far I am enjoying Python Programming: Intro to Computer Science by Zelle. I have the second edition but the 3rd and most current is very reasonably priced. Do the problems in the book and take your time to fully understand the concepts in each chapter.

If is web based you could use flask for the backend (API), and for the frontend besides a good designer skills you could pick some framework (react, angular, Vue)
No, I just downloaded the pkg from the Python site... What do you mean system wide? I didn't have to sudo anything since I went through the regular Python Installer &amp;#x200B;
Python IDLE
&gt;https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos So Pycharm replaces the default Python tinter IDLE and Anaconda replaces the install of Python entirely, or do I still have to have Python installed? What is scripting in this context?
To clarify, I would still need to have Python installed right? &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
yes, you can use the anaconda python distribution for everything. What makes this very useful is that it comes with the proper underlying C code modules that certain python modules run on top of , which is an enormous pain to configure with out. Scripting is for doing quick one offs and tests. Pycharm is where you can build a project and run everything but jupyter notebook is like a scratch pad that you can easily run and store temporary work.

This is exactly what the `__slots__` mechanism is for: optimizing memory usage of objects when instantiating many instances. Check out [this conference talk](https://youtu.be/7eeEf_rAJds) by Alex Gaynor about performance in Python for other interesting insights.
Meh, half the time I’m a normal user and macOS’s Browse-the-web/message-friends/watch-YouTube is just too much better in my opinion. Linux is mostly better for development (mostly because dealing with version lock for all the distributions you deal with is misery), though. 
SaaS.
Look into using Docker for developing Python in a container. This means the script is running on whatever os you want but you can use windows as your host os.
Lmao

Work through the Django Channels tutorial. You don't need to know anything about Django to be able to use it. The tutorial covers exactly what you want. 
Personally I only feel comfortable on Linux, and all our servers are Linux so it's easiest to develop in that as well... but it really shouldn't matter. If you feel most comfortable in Windows, in the end Python files are just plain text.
Hey I was wondering how you exported your game? I am an absolute beginner. And I’ve tried everything to convert my .py to en .exe so I can share it with my friends. But nothing works. I use anaconda and pycharm. I’ve been trying pyinstaller but I can’t get it to work. 
So, they make money by showing the ad at the bottom. If a lot of people start using the script, they will give up. On the other hand, do they really donate or just say so to attract people?

Managing Python objects in C is a great pain in multiple places of your body all at once. Trust me, whatever that article said, you don't want to do it. On top of that, Python objects are too slow to create and to access. But, C doesn't offer out of the box any replacement for vector, hash-maps etc. So, if your problem is with accessing structured data: don't try to just rewrite it in C--you will spend too much effort on it, and the performance increase will be negligible (while you most assuredly prevent your code from being executed on PyPy or other Python implementations that don't support C extensions). If you need speedy containers, use Rust or C++ (yikes). C, only if you are very confident about particular kind of container library you are going to use, and you are willing to endure the pains of redistributing that library with your project.
Does it include native traversal?
I wish I had that much time while on work.

Could also randomize the answer response delay to make it seem more human, maybe wobble the mouse a bit if possible too, some systems take mouse X,Y from javascript - not saying they use either parameters.
Looks like it is currently a very thin wrapper around asyncio protocol, and then an implementation of a server. What do you intend to do further develop the project and where do you see it going compared with other frameworks? 
I usually just install python (3) trough homebrew and pipenv then do all my work in various virtualenvs managed by pipenv. Super easy to use and clean. 
Most ppc ad based strategies (even non profits) will have IP address timers that will not charge the advertiser if the same ip makes requests at exact intervals because humans don’t do this. Behavior like this easily gets labeled as a bot and no rice will be donated bc no ads get charged. Fortunately for you, I bet this non profit doesn’t have much dev time to devote to implementing a strong bot detection. Does your script adjust your ip or change the timer? 
I've been annotating almost all of my code for the last year. Unfortunately, it takes significantly more effort, as anything apart from basic types means finding and importing the appropriate class, or defining you own types/sub-classing. Would still be worth it, but almost no third party libraries are usually typed, and huge parts of the standard library just set the type to Any, even if there is only one possible return type (so are really not typed at all). It also limits portability, if you use any of the typing module or syntax not compatible with v&lt;3.5. Hopefully all will improve once 3.4 support is dropped, and library maintainers don't have to support multiple syntaxes.
Excellent, thank you! Nice work
Look into "index". This sort of question is better suited to [r/learnpython](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=Python&amp;utm_content=t5_2qh0y)
This sub is shit.
&gt; unless you're doing front-end apps in mac or windows What does that even mean lol. I mostly agree but Mac is usually totally fine and you get a quality of life bump over Linux.
Webfaction is pretty good too. It has a bunch of set up scripts for web applications. Additionally though you could easily just set up a cron job for your scraper :p
I use pyinstaller and cx_freeze.
I think the sockets is about the lowest you can get in Python regarding networking. From Python documentation: *" The Python interface is a straightforward transliteration of the Unix system call and library interface for sockets to Python’s object-oriented style "* Sockets are a feature offered by the operating system. All major operating systems implement BSD sockets. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley\_sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets) If you want to avoid using sockets, you have go to the operating system level. ;)
**Berkeley sockets** Berkeley sockets is a Unix application programming interface (API) for Internet sockets and Unix domain sockets, used for inter-process communication (IPC). It is commonly implemented as a library of linkable modules. It originated with the 4.2BSD Unix released in 1983. A socket is an abstract representation (handle) for the local endpoint of a network communication path. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Neato! I love how coding is 20% actual useful stuff, 75% neat tricks, and 5% UB.
Thanks for sharing. I've been thinking about doing something like this as a portfolio builder for a while. Cool to see an implementation. 
You could get a raspberry pii, put a server OS on it, and run it from there. Just a suggestion.
[gitHub link](https://github.com/flobbley/vintage_media)
You can use dweet.io
[scrapinghub](https://scrapinghub.com/scrapy-cloud#pricing) is pretty great, you can run 1 crawler concurrently at decent rates for __free__. They also have cronjob like scheduling system. 
I used to write seemingly useless software too, I actually still do; it's like a kata. Here's my golfed version of your program: `k7=[' '+('_'*16)+' ','| __ __ |','| / \ / \ |','| \__/ \__/ |','| ____________ |','|_/_O________O_\_|']` `while True:` `size = int(input('How many k7s? Number of k7s per line:\n'))` `print('\n'.join(['\n'.join([line*size for line in k7]+['']) * size]))` &amp;#x200B;
No problem, it's by no means the best implementation. It has lead me on to creating a more robust solution using Django for the back end and React + Redux for the front end. Django Back End: [https://github.com/sarcoma/Project-Management-Tool-API-Prototype](https://github.com/sarcoma/Project-Management-Tool-API-Prototype) React Front End: [https://github.com/sarcoma/Project-Management-Tool-Client-Prototype](https://github.com/sarcoma/Project-Management-Tool-Client-Prototype) These are very much a work in progress. But take a look if you're interested.

I do development on Windows just fine. A lot of the major software developed on Unix has Windows builds available nowadays and software package management is simplified with Chocolatey.
Yes
Not unexpected. Posting any kind of code sparks criticism and debate over the most mundane details.
Don't buy a 'cheap computer' to program, that is stupid advice. I recommend just duel booting Ubuntu for when you're coding, but make sure the laptop is fairly compatible with Ubuntu (most are now). WSL (Linux on Windows) is fucking shit like Windows 10 itself, so no Windows still sucks and you mess around a lot with setup.

Thanks for above suggestions. I am aware about nltk solutions but I just wanted to have a module for word counting without any dependencies. Hence I tried to implement this. About your suggestions, I'll definitely work on them :)
Just found your tutorials, and I have to say a lot of them are really well explained to someone that started getting into Python!
Nice site. Celery is a very good introduction to distributed task management.
A whole framework? Are we being serious here? Whilst this is cute, and I'm sure it's got some cute implementation and wonderful benchmarks to show how it's superior to the 30 other similar projects, this is not a framework. Django is a framework. This is... Is some thin wrapper which is sort of cute and may be nice for somebody but it's really not a proper web framework. Still, I love having a diversity of ecosystem, and encourage it, but damn does the wheel get reinvented over and over and over to the point that I sometimes get the bitching and moaning about a million different solutions existing. 
Nice.
I laughed at this way harder than I should have.
Just checked it out, can you explain me a bit more about the cronjob. The only thing I can find about it are the periodic jobs, for which you need to be subscribed to scrapy cloud ($9/month).
If I understand correctly your problem with heroku is that you want to schedule the script to run at x times every day and that's a paid feature? Have you thought about automating that in the script itself? With time.sleep or something similar?
I have thought about doing that, but the free dynos will go to sleep after 30 minutes, so I am unsure how to implement such a feature. Next to that, as a free user you get 550 hours every month, which would not cover the full month if the dyno would be running 24/7. 
This was an option I was looking at, but decided to first take a look to see if there were any services out there that would let me do the same for free. I assume the best option would be the Raspberry Pi Zero?
&gt; while morehelp == 'yes': WHen you call lower(), it's no longer "yes", it's "YES". Those two are not equal, hence your loop ends.
Are you doing morehelp = input().lower() or morehelp.lower() = input()? If you're doing it correctly, try to print morehelp so you can see what it looks like. 
Tried it, it doesn’t break the loop for me. Are you sure that it is input().lower() that breaks the loop for you ?
"Letter" - "a" +1 should give you the answer .
/r/learnpython
I got rid of .lower() and it worked. I'll try again. Maybe I had a typo I didn't realize.
Thanks! That means a lot!
Yeah, but there's no room for a CoC if you rewrite his entire module in a single line.
Pycharm is what you'll want
Ah man I didn't know the extra 450 hours for confirmed cc only. I'm not sure how the sleeping works but it might not sleep in a Python script instead of a web server? I do have a paid Dyno and then I use my free slot for a different script which doesn't sleep. I'm not sure if the paid feature extends to the free Dyno that I have and that's the reason it doesn't sleep but I don't think so. My guess is that simple Python script won't sleep. If that's the case I'd definitely try to get any credit card that you can put in there just for the extra 450h. They're definitely trust worthy and I love how simple their system is. You can get a clarification of how the sleeping works at /r/heroku, they're pretty active there. Hope it helps
Once you go pandas you never go back
Appreciate the reply, the problem is not necessarily that I don't trust heroku with credit card info, but moreso that I don't have a credit card in the first place. That's also the reason I wasn't able to use either Amazon AWS or Google Cloud.
Thanks for the anwser 😎 I’ll try that
Sorry man. Hope one of the other solutions can help!
Neat! I tried to refactor this a bit: ```python rows = int(input('x by x x=')) board = [' --- ', '| |', ' --- '] for subspace in board * rows: print(rows * subspace) ```
No problem, appreciate the help nonetheless.
More like normal squares ;) But SD cards sounds nice
Or try Atom with the ide-python package! You can download Atom from atom.io. Install jupyter from pip with ‘python3.7 -m pip install jupyter’ and also install the hydrogen package in Atom as well. This will allow you to run python code in Atom like in a Jupyter notebook :) 
Did you end up doing this? I'm looking around for a good CLI library but I'm all python 3 these days.

Why aren’t you using a for loop? Probably half the comments on the last post were people saying how bad his loops looked
I'm new to python :(
I have programmed in python on Ubuntu and Windows 7 and 8. Tbh, windows is fine for programming in python. The only real drawback to programming in Windows is the command line is garbagio, and I would advise to just using Cywgin instead of using the default console. 
I know developers who (voluntarily) use Windows too. Some are good, some are bad. If they are productive, I don’t care about whatever development environment they use. Personal preference. But if I see a new dev with a Windows machine, I can’t help but to make some assumptions. Just as I would if I saw them write code like in that example.
That's true, but I was taking exception to calling it a framework. It really isn't. Whilst no exact definition for a web framework exists, at least that I know of, this doesn't meet even the loosest of one's. I do like that it exists, and I'm sure it was a great learning experience. 
The default nbconvert templates to pdf aren't the greatest. You can find mine at: [https://github.com/t-makaro/nb\_pdf\_template](https://github.com/t-makaro/nb_pdf_template)
Why did you define backspace as new line?
Use one of the website checking services like pingdom to ping your site regularly as a replacement for a scheduler?
It was called newline at the start. I thought it would be better to say newline instead of \n (realised it was not), and I was talking to my friend and he asked me how to spell backspace, and for a reason id wrote it there, and just forgot to remove it... Whoops
pipenv or pyenv?
I kinda wanna see dickbutts...
oof
I am currently checking out webfaction, and like you said the trail version still limits you to ftp only. I am unsure how to use my web scraper python script and setup a cron job for this like you mentioned. Do you possibly have some instructions how to accomplish this?
You shirkers are going to give python a bad name. :-)
Nice! You mentioned that you were new to Python in another comment so I just wanted to point out that you can change the line i = i + 1 to i += 1 and it will do the same thing! Your way works perfectly fine, this is just a shorter/simpler way of accomplishing the same thing.
Sorry ;)
That's cool! ill change it rn so when I go back to look at the code ill remember it! thanks!
There’s also stuff like [docopt](https://pypi.org/project/docopt/) if you’re OK with completely different approaches. 
Yes. I have exactly the same thing on a RPI, runs headless, never dies and accessed by remote.
Yes! Python is exploding into Network Engineering! Even though it's not pure python, I recommend starting with [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/list_of_network_modules.html). It's easier (for simple stuff) and people have already coded a bunch of network modules for it. Eventually, your use case will become complicated enough that Python will be a better choice than Ansible. Then I recommend looking into [netmiko](https://github.com/ktbyers/netmiko) to help you ssh into devices, requests to call APIs and Jinja2 to template configs. Also, if you're going to go the way of coding for network devices, put some thought into deployment of your code. I see a lot of network engineers who don't think enough about things like easily installing their code onto a server with network access, good code style (pep8 for Python), versioning their code with Git, NOT EMBEDDING PASSWORDS AND API KEYS DIRECTLY INTO CODE (can you tell that's a big one? Use config files or environmental variables for starters here), etc. It's okay to be basic about this auxiliary stuff at first, and it feels like more busywork compared to actually writing code for your network, but it's very important that you can return to code you wrote 6 months ago and understand it. Buddy up with a systems or software engineer - a lot of them love this stuff. Finally, there's a good amount of people like you. A bunch of them (including the creator of netmiko) are on the [networktocode](http://networktocode.herokuapp.com/) Slack channel. And if you can make this work, you can basically write your own checks.
Are there any other uses for the Pi Zero? The reason I am asking this is that the Pi Zero W is about €10 while the Pi 3 Model B+ is €30, and I was thinking that the Pi 3 has much more utility as it can be used later on as a media center/pi hole.
Well pi zero w is smaller and slicker, it also packs a punch - 1GHZ is just fine for minimal Linux installation - I wouldn’t do pi hole on it though
idk ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
You are pathetic.
Come on dude, there's no need for that.
Disregard this comment/account. It’s a troll that just blasts horrible negativity in both English and German across reddit. Worthless person that should be reported and removed. 
No it’s actually okay, even tho programming is what I do (I go to school), I’d like to get better at it, and critics help me get better :)
It's almost like Wheels, as a cross-platform and relocatable package format designed specifically for Python, didn't try to abstract file locations and permissions. I wonder why that might be?

The cheapest 10-year-old computer is sufficient for school programming, so a brand new 8gb ram pc will do just fine.
thank you :)
Sorry! I tried searching for active help forums and thought that this seemed best. 
Thanks, this solved it! I am relatively new to Python, and having years of experience in Java, this idea of global variables having the same pointer between two different objects didn't even cross my mind. Way different in lower level languages.
Try replacing ''\\n' with '\\n'. At first, I thought the problem was that the problem would be the difference in line-endings between Linux and Windows. I then had another look at your example and noticed that you have tried to escape the '\\n'. There is no need to escape the control character. &gt;&gt;&gt; 'Hello\nthere.'.replace('\\n', ' ' ) 'Hello\nthere.' &gt;&gt;&gt; 'Hello\nthere.'.replace('\n', ' ' ) 'Hello there.' &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 'Hello\\nthere.'.replace('\n', ' ' ) 'Hello\\nthere.' &gt;&gt;&gt; 'Hello\\nthere.'.replace('\\n', ' ' ) 'Hello there.' &gt;&gt;&gt;

woah... wasn't expecting this for an answer... I was expecting "sure, learn a bit of python 3, you'll be fine" :-D Thanks for the info, I'll have a look into all of the above!
It actually doesn’t work because of board[2] although I’m sure I could make it work
cheers, I'll check it out!
This same code also works for our supersizes 16x16 pixel Ubercorn :D and, if you’re particularly flush with cash, can be scaled up to a 128x16 pixel marquee so you too can advertise donner kebabs or all night internet cafe services!
&gt; Is it possible to do this in Python? yes. &gt; Is this a big step for a non programming guy to start? yes, huge step. &gt; Where should I start? Some basic python tutorials. We have [a pretty long list of learning resources in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index#wiki_new_to_programming.3F). Try a few and see what resonates. For a brand new programmer I'd recommend automate the boring stuff with python. After that find a tutorial for a web framework such as flask. Come visit us in /r/learnpython if you get stuck. 
My computer is 14 years old, 4gb ram and intel core 2 duo cpu. Debian board and works fine.
Have you import 'fib\_module'?
You can run GCSE Python programs online! A decade old computer would still be more than enough for such small scripts.
But can it make rectangles? Go ahead, one up me.
VGTV is already supported by [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/), but if you want to contribute code to a popular open source project you could supply a patch for vg.no.
About 11
Challenge accepted, I’ll get working tomorrow. 
:(
You're welcome! And learning this stuff alone is *hard*. Don't be discouraged if you struggle :)
I don't have much experience on writing python modules in C. But, it seems like you are trying to free the same pointer two times. &amp;#x200B; At line 49, you assign matrix\_old to matrix. At line 51, you free old\_matrix which is same as matrix (This is my guess, I don't know the exact behaviour using PyObject). So, you should not be able to free fib\_matrix again, in line 87. Try to comment lines 51, 59 and 60.
Install numexpr and holoviews
at line 50 matrix hold another object returned from matrix_mult function which is different from matrix_old assigned at line 49! ps: if I run: import fib_module fib_module.fib_mat(1000) threre is no problem reported!
Just want to say they missed a chance to call SQLAlchemy SQLChemy
I'm not sure if I agree about developing on the systems you plan on using, but an example of what the parent commenter had would be developing a Qt app that you expect to run on Windows. That said, for those type of things, you just need good tests, and to test on all the target platforms, not necessarily to develop on the target platforms.
I feel like fstrings could make this sexy

Huh, okay. Now, I am not sure. But, in general, the way you approach C is very confusing. 1- If you need a dummy variable, you should create one in the same scope and allocate space for it. Then, free that one. When you transfer \`matrix\_old = matrix\` pointer like this, everything gets mixed up very easily. It is hard keep track of this in large projects. 2- It is a good practice to avoid returning pointers in C functions unless you have to. So, instead of this \`matrix = matrix\_mult(matrix\_old, matrix\_old);\`, you can do \`matrix\_mult(matrix\_old, matrix\_old, matrix);\` and manipulate matrix inside the function. You don't have to return anything. If you look into C libraries this is the common way to do it. \&gt;at line 50 matrix hold another object returned from matrix\_mult function which is different from matrix\_old assigned at line 49! Well, this may not be safe to do in C. Think of it this way. Assume you declare an array in matrix\_mult and return it. You have a pointer in matrix\_pow that you assign the result. Now, C has no idea what that pointer includes.

* matrix and matrix_old are stack variables which hold a 2-dimensional arrays of **PyObject**\*; these objects are assigned by **PyNumber_Add** function which allocates the necessary memory for the object returned and increments the count reference. * I introduced matrix_old (and result_old) to hold the old **PyObject**s addresses and free it after matrix variable is updated because otherwise there memory will leak
Could you explain why that doesn't work? Both your and mine give the same output on my side! Reminder: `delimiter.join(iterable)` will insert the delimiter only b/w the elements of the iterable, and will not insert the delimiter before the first element or after the last element. Output on my side: &gt;&gt;&gt; board = [' --- ', '| | ', ' --- '] &gt;&gt;&gt; print('\n'.join(board)) --- | | --- &gt;&gt;&gt; x = 3 &gt;&gt;&gt; print(*[(x*board[0] + '\n' + x*board[1] + '\n' + x*board[2]) for i in range(x)], sep='\n') --- --- --- | | | | | | --- --- --- --- --- --- | | | | | | --- --- --- --- --- --- | | | | | | --- --- --- &gt;&gt;&gt; print(*['\n'.join(x*r for r in board) for i in range(x)], sep='\n') --- --- --- | | | | | | --- --- --- --- --- --- | | | | | | --- --- --- --- --- --- | | | | | | --- --- --- &gt;&gt;&gt; 
Nice boxes. Upvote for the boxes. (and your code is cool)
PS: since each row is the same, we don't even need the `for i in range(x)` thingy. Further, `*[y]*x` is interpreted as `*([y]*x)`. So we can finally reduce it down to just print(*['\n'.join(x*r for r in board)]*x, sep='\n')
Hmm I think I put it in wrong. It was most likely a mistake from my end
Yeah. I always try to be elitist and show off list comprehensions when I can because they look cool
 I came across a full Free tutorial on YouTube for identifying lanes in a self driving car and thought it was really interesting. Check it out!! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LECg-Gv5xjo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LECg-Gv5xjo) 
I am a self-taught programmer speaking purely from experience. Compilers are dumb. That means if your code is confusing to me, the same is valid for the compiler. It doesn't matter if you are allowed to do certain things C as long as compiler can't understand what you are trying to do. &amp;#x200B; Now, do you call this magic? I am just being practical here. This works and yours doesn't. [https://pastebin.com/1WpYfyDc](https://pastebin.com/1WpYfyDc)
 Hey everyone, I came across a full tutorial on YouTube for identifying lanes in a self driving car and thought it was really interesting. Check it out!! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LECg-Gv5xjo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LECg-Gv5xjo) 
It is not your refactoring of matrix_mult that make it work. You have removed matrix_free from matrix_pow. it is a leak memory unless there is a cleanup at program exit!
I didn't remove it. I moved it to the end of matrix_pow...
Replacing the while with a for loop would also be better in this case. 
Finally put in the 20 minutes or so to learn to use *virtualenv*. That's the only part that's interesting.
Have you tried, you know-- debugging with gdb? I don't write C extensions often so I don't know what is internally calling `free`-- but for reference that's a function that takes a pointer to some heap memory and attempts to, well, free it. If it's a null pointer, it does nothing. It it can't free it, for whatever reason, it is not guaranteed what it will do-- there's no defined behavior. However, free can only successfully free pointers to memory that are * currently allocated and on the heap * not in the middle of allocated block Which means you're trying to either free something on the stack, or something in the middle of an allocated block. You can use gdb to set a breakpoint before the failure, and then go up the backtrace to determine what is causing it.
I have run this program import fib_module fib_module.fib_mat(100000) through valgrind and it report memory leak ==16745== HEAP SUMMARY: ==16745== in use at exit: 381,130 bytes in 170 blocks ==16745== total heap usage: 5,610 allocs, 5,440 frees, 8,166,524 bytes allocated ==16745== ==16745== LEAK SUMMARY: ==16745== definitely lost: **70,256** bytes in 16 blocks ==16745== indirectly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks ==16745== possibly lost: 2,200 bytes in 4 blocks ==16745== still reachable: 308,674 bytes in 150 blocks ==16745== suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
"Ubercorn". You folks are ridiculous but I love it!
So you could have used a for loop instead of a while loop. So you could do for i in range(1,rows,1): This eliminates the while loop. Which is good because while loops are more prone to failure. 
Just a guess here but it seems as though you aren't initializing the module correctly in C
Hash table in Python is a dict. The rest are pretty trivial to implement. These questions are asked over at r/learnpython, though. Read this subreddit and r/learnpython's sidebar to get a better feel of the communities and for additional learning resources.
It's close enough. When you consider possible collisions and buckets as a result, you're technically just shy of it.
Can you give an example where this is useful? I’m not getting how skipping printable characters is a cool trick. 
Use concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor()

You can include any type of file in the wheel or egg file using setuptoolss pkg_resources, see the second answer here. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/779495/python-access-data-in-package-subdirectory BTW, this is the type of question better suited to /r/learnpython
Do you even understand the the example above?
that's cool :o
[removed]
Is this like the time /r/softwaregore was doing the volume controls?
Hey thank you! I always enjoy learning something new! If I may ask, why is that method preferred?
The problem might be the fact that you are passing matrix into matrix_pow by value instead of by reference. So when you create new versions of matrix, they remain within the scope of matrix_pow. When you return back out into fib_mat, your fib_matrix still contains its original contents (which you likely already free'd inside matrix_pow), while you've leaked the new matrix variable you created inside.
You should throw a lambda in there for good measure.
Looks like you're freeing the same address multiple times. On mobile so I'm just skimming but what if you take out all the frees in your code to see if it's caused by your manual freeing of memory or whether the Python collector is collecting something unexpectedly.
I genuinely don't know if "dynos going to sleep" will fault this suggestion, but if you do decide to do automate it in the script itself, check out https://pypi.org/project/schedule/
This is not related to Python. Please stop spamming posts from epsagon
Your are right! I commented out matrix_free(&amp;fib_matrix) and now there is no error! thanks

This has nothing to do with python, but anyway: I'd depends on your filesystem. Since I'm guessing that you work on windows, that would be NTFS for you (or FAT if the file was on an USB stick). I don't really know NTFS, but if it works similar to ext4 (for Linux), if you use some kind of file recovery program there's a good chance that you'll get it back. But even if that works, it would be a process that takes a long time, and after that you might have to find the file from in a few thousand or however many would be restored (sometimes program can't restore the original file path). I personally don't think that it'd be worth it.
Adding to sponbobie, no problem being reported doesn't mean anything because AFAIK free'ing twice is UB
RPM has very little to do with Python. It is certainly not designed for it. I couldn't understand the rest of your post.
You're most likely shit out of luck. However, the fact that it's blank is very worrying. If it was a jumbled mess it would have almost definitely have been something to do with your text encoding. The one thing I can recommend you try is to cat the file and see what comes up, you may have an odd line ending and that could be causing the weirdness; however, any decent editor should pick that up so it's not likely that. Just to check that there is in fact something there and not just pure NUL repeated over and over, open the file with a hex editor. There may be lots of 00 but you should see lots of other stuff as well. 
Very nice.
Thank you! It makes my day to see them pop up on here. Happy hacking :D
Instead of `if square == False:` you can just do `if square:`.
Tried a hex editor and it is nothing but 00. I'm just going to have to salvage it from my last backup. Thanks though :)
I agree, there are cases when Python is more readable. I dont say Q is more intuitive in **all** cases, it is just more intuitive in **most** cases. This holds for not only lists but for data frames as well. Tables are supported natively in Q. Take a look on this comparison: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/python-data-analysis-really-simple-ferenc-bodon-ph-d-/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/python-data-analysis-really-simple-ferenc-bodon-ph-d-/) &amp;#x200B; Glad to see that you looked at Q on Wikipedia. To get a better view I recommend a free book called Q for Mortals: [http://code.kx.com/q4m3/](http://code.kx.com/q4m3/) &amp;#x200B;
Don't trust this. `pkg_resources` is broken as is the entire packaging and deployment process in Python. However, sometimes, bad but familiar tool is still better than making your own (which runs a chance of being even worse). So, you are between a rock and a hard place. Still, I'd go for a more serious packaging tool, perhaps one that comes with your target for deployment (eg. RPM). Some people would even use containers or VMs for this. The choice would depend on complexity of your program, your expectations of deployment reliability, price, and, most likely, a lot of other factors I cannot predict because I don't know your specifics.

Since your system is probably a systemd one, here's something that wasn't mentioned in your thread: &gt; ... (core dumped) Well, lucky you! You can see what the program was doing before it crashed. Look into systemctl status systemd-coredump And here: https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-coredump.html for more info. One thing you may want to pay attention to: in core dumps, it usually tells you in the beginning what was the memory layout. This can be useful to figuring out if the pointer was, in principle, valid, but, maybe deallocated twice, or, it was just garbage. I.e. memory layout will tell you borderline values for things that are stored in memory, like code, data, stack, heap etc. It would be a plausible pointer value if, say, it was a value that could, in principle, be allocated on the heap. But, if you are trying to free something that seems like it would be in, say, code area, that's a good sign that your pointer was already garbage before that happened.
Okay
The book is great as well as the video. I have a few dozen Python books yet still refer to this one from time to time.
I fixed the problem. I have just to Py_INCREF matrix objects in matrix_pow function before entring while loop! thanks
Yeah. There is absolutely nothing there. For what it's worth, this is probably a great time to learn to use git. If you're not doing anything fancy you only need to know like three to five commands and most IDEs make basic usage trivial. Gitlab is a great free service with free, unlimited private repos. I highly recommend you check them out. No need to stress that a friend in the class steals your work or that the public sees your code whilst you're still learning. It's an especially great way to make backups for code and is also fantastic when you realise you've just made a total mess of things and want to return to an earlier state. 
You shouldn't be using a while loop though `for i in range(rows)`
[Done!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9k4ul2/vintage_media_in_a_single_1337character_line/)
Agreed.
Okay so here's how I would do/did it.Github recently announced their education pack provides a free hobby dyno. First get a GitHub education account,a .edu mail is preferred but not required.You could use your school or college id card. Then your parents most likely have a debit card you could use that and signup on heroku for verification and done. Heroku doesn't charge a cent or if you fear your script might actually go over their limit just implement it in your python script.
Thanks man!
They are offering python at GCSE these days? Man I wish I was a kid in the modern age, the closest I got to reprogramming was damn 555 times in design and tech. 
Thats great, being able to have someone who knows what they are doing look over your code is handy. But like others have said python is pretty low requirements. It can run on a raspberry pi (i know I'm doing it) so a full desktop shouldn't be an issue.
Thank you :)
You are most welcome!
The easiest way to do that is probably to check the length of the string and pad it with the necessary zeros: def padder(s): return '0' * ((4-len(s) % 4) % 4) + s After processing, you can remove the padding with `first_block.lstrip('0')`. Also, you can turn a list into a joined string with `''.join(mylist)`. Additionally, try not to assign variable names like `list` as those will prevent you from using the built-ins of those names in that scope.
Sourcecode for Python 0.9.1 is available here: [https://www.python.org/download/releases/early/](https://www.python.org/download/releases/early/) I was able to build this in Ubuntu 16.04 WSL on Windows 10 with just `make -C src/` For some reason the multiplication operator raises an integer overflow error so I had to work around that.
Wow that's a great idea, I haven't thought of that. I will try to use it. Thanks a lot!
Yeah if I pad the numbers with zeros from left side, the value of the number doesn't change. Seems like that would be the best solution here I think, but I didn't think of it before you and Farranor mentioned it. &amp;#x200B; Also by representing do you mean what type am I using for the binary numbers? I am using list with the string value of the binary number
Oh, and just in case you were more interested in the destination than the journey, take a look at the `int`, `bin`, and `hex` built-in functions.
Yeah I figured there is actually a function for something so simple, but actually I am doing it just for the journey. Will look on those after I finish my project though! Thanks.
It seems sth else rather than snakes to me, but that's not the point ofc.
Oh my bad! Apologies I'll go to LearnPython right away :)
I was expecting snakes the animal, but this works too.
You would run it for tracing functions running in your program to debug performance
I like it how you said "hard" work
No worries, it did not come off wrong.
In addition to /u/Davidjhyatt's link to the free version of "Automate the Boring Stuff", the second book of that Humble Bundle, The Linux Command Line, is also available for free (Creative Commons license) at [http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php](http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php). So, if you're interested in learning about the Linux Command Line, that book may also be worth a look.
Probably not. I believe you are not printing printable characters? You are deleting the string? 
If you want good practices, avoid alembic/django-style migrations entirely. The version numbers are a pain in the ass, and they aren't very testable. Instead: - take a dump of your current production database - take a diff of current production vs intended production - use the diff output as a the basis for a migration script, edit the script if necessary - test locally to ensure the script applies correctly and results in an identical schema, and that your app works with the new schema - deploy your app, run your migration script Disclaimer: I'm the author of [a database schema diff tool](https://migra.djrobstep.com/), which I wrote out of frustration with alembic/django-style migrations.
Yes. I created a new string where some set of characters are *deleted* by mapping them to `None` (this is the trick in `maketrans). `printable` here are just some sort of characters to be deleted. They have *NO* special meaning or purpose at all. https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.translate return None, to delete the character from the return string; 
Ok I will check this out - thanks!
Thanks for this. Does anyone have any tips for studying using digital books? I find it really hard because i still write notes, would a dedicated ebook reader help? Should i just get a cheap tablet? Is there a way to make and save notes in the ebooks? Print out the pages i need? How do i become more organised with digital stuff?
It's time to draw dicks now
Thanks, paid the $15 and got the whole bundle of python books!

Show /r/learnpython the code you have tried and describe where you are stuck. **[Be sure to format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F)** and include which version of python and what OS you are using. *** ^(this bot is written and managed by /u/IAmKindOfCreative) ^(This bot is currently under development and experiencing changes to improve its usefulness)
I'm not sure what you looking for to do with your code, but if you want to simplify and make smaller code base, you could do something like this (of course there other approaches too): &amp;#x200B; `TD = "/¯\\"` `BD = "\\_/"` `def draw_row():` `print(f"{TD * cols}\n{BD * cols}")` `def draw_all():` `for _ in range(rows):` `draw_row()` `draw_all()` And input as you sad to do as args ... &amp;#x200B; Of course this can be even smaller without draw\_row but i like to have separated logic.
I think what you are hitting on is function composition. In isolation the two functions do separate things, but you can “pipe” them together to achieve an interesting result. This is very valuable to recognize as you research APIs. 
Be the change you want to see in the world
You can add comments with adobe reader
cool!
You can add comments and highlights using Google play books. Then the notes are searchable, and you can have them out put to a separate Google doc if you ask for it in the settings
Minus error checking my code is really only 13 lines compared to your 8. You could shorten yours with: TD, BD = "/¯\\", "\\_/" as well, but that might be less aesthetically pleasing. For me, this was an exercise in balancing extensiblity and simplicity. I could possibly drop it down to maybe five lines in all, but it would only be able to print hexagons, and I'd be throwing the style guide out the window. But if I were to increase the block\_set, and write a new order, I could print a lot more than just hexagons. One liners are great, and entertaining, but they have their place. Also, suddenly kicking myself for not separating logic for the final call.
noob question. these are ebooks right ?
Two options a) run your script in debugger (for example the one in Visual Studio Code), set a breakpoint and look at the value of the string b) add a line in your script that prints the string to standard out, for example &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; s = ['short string', 'more complex \r\n multiline \r\n string\n' ] &gt;&gt;&gt; print(s) ['short string', 'more complex \r\n multiline \r\n string\n'] &gt;&gt;&gt; REPL is often your best friend.

Hey Skj8, these cheatsheets are very useful for me, a cs student! Thanks for the effort in compiling all these notes! Any chance that you have notes for Graphic user interface, Image processing etc?
Yes
Yes.
I wonder if Ada Lovelace ever predicted that it would only be a matter of time until we tell our computers to draw dicks. 
What editor is this? It looks nice.
Looks like vim inside some terminal multiplexer, inside windows 10 linux thing.

I tried using this but even trying to install all necessary packages through pip gives me the error that my disk limit is exceeded (100MB).
Yup vim with solarised dark color theme in a split ConEmu window on Windows 10. Actually wrote the code in VSCode and switched over to vim for uh reasons.
Appreciate the reply, however the problem is that I can't verify on heroku since neither I or my parents have a credit card (which is the only method accepted by heroku for verification).
thanks u/kerbobotat u/ambika45
I am glad they are helpful.. I will check and update here.. 
&gt; you can have them out put to a separate Google doc if you ask for it in the settings damn thanks for this, i was wondering how to export notes(but too lazy to go hunting for it myself)
fair warning - automate the boring stuff is not for programmers, it's for beginners. may frustrate you a bit if you're looking for a meatier experience but is fairly good for getting started in python

Thanks kindly, do you have any good examples / code please?
Beautiful work. Well done.
It was a fun hour or so, but doesn't seem to be getting a positive reception. Ah well.
Debit is also accepted though.
It’s good work - it’s funny and it’s technically interesting.
Just checked and it seems you're right. Unfortunately, they only accept Visa, MasterCard or JCB credit card while I have a Maestro debit card.
Are you the author of 'Perl One-Liners"? I have absolutely 0 experience in Perl, but would definitely like to learn about it some more. Would I have to know Perl well in order to benefit from your book? 
Ah sorry to hear that. Maybe there are other free unix shells out there. if you could just spend $2.99/year , you can even get one nat VPS with root access. Good luck mate.
Ah man can you change it? Maybe ask your parents,it takes 3-4 days to change your card. You can try the github education pack method but it might still require verification or check Amazon's aws and see if they accept maestro cards. If I may ask what does your script do? 
Sounds like a /r/learnpython question
Hello, could you please provide some progress info? I would be interest in some comment to see how the project is evolving - I cant wait to start using vibora (right now it seems impossible to use with python 3.7 due to reserved async keyword), anyways thank for the project, you did a great job!
Give pipenv a try
I am okay with a small amount of money, just wanted to check first to see if it was possible to do for free. Could you point me towards the site with the VPS with root access for $2.99/year and maybe some additional info on how to set it up?
I could change it myself since I am over 18, but would personally prefer not to. Tried the github education pack as well but this unfortunately still requires verification through credit/debit card. My script is a simple web scraper script that goes to a website and downloads/appends the data (depending on if data is already present) from a table and saves it to a csv/uploads to Dropbox.
Yes, I'm the author of Perl One-Liners. You don't have to know Perl well to benefit from my book. I start with very light examples and build up on previous knowledge and explain everything carefully. My book is also available online for free on my blog. At first I wrote it as a series of blog posts, then I self-published it as an e-book, and then later published it with No Starch Press. Take a look at these blog posts and see if you like the style of the book and can follow it - [http://www.catonmat.net/blog/introduction-to-perl-one-liners/](Introduction to Perl one-liners) and [http://www.catonmat.net/blog/perl-one-liners-explained-part-one/](Perl one-liners explained, part one). 
Looks interesting, will take a look.
At least one person liked it. Thanks. :)
Lol wut. Automate the boring stuff is a mediocre book for absolute beginners. What in gods name are you using as a reference book for?
Except I know Python pretty well from having spent around 10 years working in it and I'm not really that interested in using the language these days. This is clearly a language implementation issue from my perspective.
Here's the [scipy 2D example](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.gaussian_kde.html) adapted to loglog def measure(n): "Measurement model, return two coupled measurements." # changed here to have 100 ** distribution so that the dynamic range is expanded m1 = 100**np.random.normal(size=n) m2 = 100**np.random.normal(size=n) return m1, m2 # don't do subtraction and addition here, just to make m1 and m2 positive # no changes to this chunk m1, m2 = measure(2000) xmin = m1.min() xmax = m1.max() ymin = m2.min() ymax = m2.max() pts = np.linspace(-8, 8, 100) # changed here to make grid with even spacing on log scale X, Y = np.meshgrid(pts, pts) positions = np.vstack([X.ravel(), Y.ravel()]) values = np.vstack([np.log10(m1), np.log10(m2)]) # note log10 here kernel = gaussian_kde(values) Z = np.reshape(kernel(positions).T, X.shape) import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from matplotlib import colors # here I cleaned up the axis settings into one ax.set() and replaced imshow with pcolormesh fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.set(xscale='log', yscale='log', xlim=([xmin, xmax]), ylim=[ymin, ymax]) plt.pcolormesh(10**X, 10**Y, Z, norm=colors.LogNorm()) ax.plot(m1, m2, 'k.', markersize=2) I use pcolormesh because imshow is kind of a fucked function and I don't know how to use log x, y axes with it.
I've never used humble bundle before - If you pay $15, do you get everything on this page? Or everything in the $15 section? Or only one item?

Whenever you pay to get a specific tier, you get all the tiers before it also. So, if you paid $15, you get the $1 tier and $8 dollar tier as well.
Holy moly! What a deal
Whenever you pay for a specific tier, you get all the tiers before that as well. So in the case of this bundle, if you pay $15, you get all the books in the $15 section as well as all the books in the $8 section and $1 section.
For $15 you get everything on the page. 
Yes, little change on title
Awesome, I'm definitely going to check it out! Thanks!
Python performs like a crippled spider in network programming compared to golang.
As far as I know, this is the first python bytecode viewer available, taking advantage of the new python 3.7 feature of recursive disassembly. Please let me know if others exist, or if you decide to make one! This has already been useful to me personally to help optimizing some hot python functions. I hope others will find it useful or use it to learn more about python's internals. I was surprised at how few optimizations python does, but that makes sense considering how dynamic the language is.
It's not a snake, it's a bicep. See the vein?

I work in a calibration shop and we have a python program called Speed Sheets. It automatically sends voltage, resistance, amp values to a calibrator. The job itself is boring so I copied and dissected the code to learn from it. 
this has become a meme now

Yeah reddit is full of it. 99% of the time if a sub settles on a single resource its not organic. That book is no exception, he doesnt even try to hide it.
I'm at 13 years. There are still things I don't know. /r/learnpython is not just for beginners. You have a question about how something works. That's learning. The fact that you're over using python is not the question and if that is the why are you doing it.
There is enough politics. Can we not make python a political arm?

You can convert them to PDFs like I did though. Much easier to use
What these books are free
Ahahahaha loved this!
This is fun to read. 
Hey sorry to assume your age. So here's the idea,you could use pythonanywhere and by looking at the whitelisted sites there's bitly and such.So maybe you could use them for redirecting and get to your destination site.Just an idea though don't know if this would actually work.
That's not fake typing. He's just got a very good gaming keyboard and he's wearing ergonomic shoes and he knows how to press 42 keys with one finger..
I don't get how this works? If I pay $1, do I still get the book??
Learning some new things for back end dev in Flask like unit and integration testing and REST.
If you pay $1 - you get first 5 books. If you pay $15 - you get all 15 books.
Well they are already in PDF, along with epub and mobi formats.
Oh yeah, my bad. There was one in there that wasnt a pdf. That is what I had in mind. Not all of them
What's the point of the "more" variable? 
I just discovered tokei thanks to you. Good job ! :)
Give an example of what is not working please
If I pay $15, do I get the books in $1, $8, and $15s?
I'm using CLI tool called "black", it suits my needs very well. Although it's style differs a little bit from PyCharm.

So let's say that you have a few python files, they have different indentions, different space rules (e.g., \`a =1\`, \`b=2\`, and\`c= 3\`). What I wanted to do is to format all of the code automatically, maybe to PEP 8. Hope this is clear.
thanks! 
Not all of them.
PyCharm checks for Pep8 by default if I remember correctly. There are also a few different tools / [hotkeys to reformat](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/reformatting-source-code.html) / changing indentation of the code. These can apply to single line, selection, file or entire project. 
No. They both PEP-8 compliant. But Black's style was rethinked with pretty clear main goal: stable, minimal diffs. Better to see it once: https://github.com/ambv/black. It is very nice, although. 
Right I think you were talking about Inspection Code and PEP8 is ok for me. However, I did not find a way to automatically fix the code. Do you have any idea on this? 
Um, no? Taking your example from the other comment. I have a file containing: a =1 b=2 c= 3 Now I use the hotkey to reformat the file (⌥⇧⌘L on Mac). It will now change to be Pep8 compliant: a = 1 b = 2 c = 3 
Mandatory link for these kind of threads: http://www.hackertyper.com/ PS. I'm not implying that the guy from the op's video is faking it.;)
The hotkey works perfectly! Thanks!
btw do you know whether there is a formatter (or skeleton) for comments (e.g., description, param, return) following the PEP8 standard? 
It wasn't just you. I've been in infrastructure Operations / Engineering now for over 15 years now. I definitely know what I'm doing, but I don't know Python and I'd like to. Everyone starts somewhere, except apparently that guy.
There are plenty of non programming roles that can be helped with basic python, that aren't intern level.
Just get a credit card, why not just get a credit card?
It's easy to think everyone should know the basic things you know. You think they're easy so why wouldn't everyone else? I don't blame them but sometimes people don't even realise they were being impolite and a gentle nudge helps. Not sure if this is one of those times but we'll see.
Some of the problems with alembic/django/rails-style migrations: - Annoying version number management - Management of long "chain" of migration files - Unnecessary coupling between ORM and migration tool - Heavyweight process to generate and run each migration, which slows down local development - Bad testability I talked in more depth about this topic at last year's PostgresOpen, if you're interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xr498W8oMRo 
Those will come out looking like snakes for sure
There is this one, [https://remarkable.com/](https://remarkable.com/) but is quite expensive.
That's a pretty broad assignment. Well, the beauty of strings is you can do all sorts of silly meta stuff with getattr(), or you can play around with regular expressions. A good tool to learn regex and quickly test them is [https://pythex.org/](https://pythex.org/). If I have a ton of attributes I want to perform an operational against I use strings.split() and map() to call a function for every attribute name. Another good [example](https://github.com/joke2k/faker/blob/master/faker/generator.py#L71) is how Faker uses strings to call all sorts of provider methods. So you can do something like fake.generator.parse('{{company}} {{ address}}') and get back the results from two different methods.
True enough. A long long time ago I started out IT doing desktop support, and I'm sure I was an absolutely insufferable ass about it (didn't help that I'm autistic to boot) I was stunned that people didn't know the simplest thing such as file mappings and printer settings and how to open a command prompt to ping something. How could they be so stupid! Then one day it hit me like a ton of bricks... I can't even do my own taxes, these people are doing other peoples taxes, and business taxes and super complicated taxy type stuff that I can't even begin to understand. And those advertisers, what the hell do they do? I couldn't sell water to a man dying of thirst, I can't comprehend how they do what they do, and they obviously do it well because we have so much business. After that realization, I became a lot more tolerant of other peoples ignorance because I realized there is so much more I don't know than the tiny fraction of knowledge I'd managed to accumulate (read, obsess on) &amp;#x200B; The good news is, if ignorant, autistic, young me can come to that realization then pretty much anyone can. It also helped my career tremendously because that realization freed me to start asking questions, and learning things I'd never known I could learn before.
Make a mini game based on strings you input into the command window. 
Even includes a section about vim? This is great. Thanks for sharing!
It's a really hard question to answer, as c doesn't exactly have exceptions of its own, so the python interpreter has to manually unwind the stack. However, your code relies on the c++ compiler unwinding the stack, which really means that whatever is going on under the hood is the big difference here. It might also mean, however, that c++ is doing the more "correct" thing due to the explicit constraints of the language. Honestly there are a lot of variables at play here, I wouldn't worry about a 20x slowdown on exceptional cases in your language right now. Disclaimer: I am not a c++ expert and you might want to reach out to one on /r/cplusplus

What made you choose VS Code over PyCharm?
leetspeak translator! (e.g. whoami &lt;-&gt; wh04m1)
I dont think i could ever forget the struggle when I first started self teaching python. Id spend hours on problems that now seem trivial.
`code &gt; reformat code` in the menu will fix those spacing issues.
Which one looks better?
I was on the hunt for this too. But I've learned to understand matplotlib, little by little. It's worth it to invest the time to learn the basics. 
A few years ago while I was teaching myself about a few different things I wrote a Swedish Chef-inator. I still use it from time to time for fun. 
Maybe I titled it wrong? Should I have mentioned cassettes? I'm better at coding than posting. =\
I was getting a podcast manually, now I call a script. It gets every one that I don't have. Not a crazy timek saver, but was also my first script that was originally a bash script converted and improved into python
Sometimes I have to translate pdfs, which is a pita trying to copy paste it all into google so I made a script to pull text data from pdfs and run it through google translate. https://github.com/dunn0052/PDFtranslator
Experienced programmers can skip to Part 2 to learn about the various modules (web scraping, PDF parsing, updating spreadsheets, etc). Part 1 is more of a beginner's programming guide.
I had a daily task to issue SSL certificates for new uses. It took about half an hour per batch, got a batch every couple days. I built a system to handle it via our bug tracker and after a bit of tuning It became one or two ‘authorize’ button clicks. Maybe 5 minutes a day if you’re estimating high. That’s probably the best one, and I did it over three years ago. Still runs, sometimes we bolt on extra features. 
What's the purpose of this blockchain? And would you like to test it? (Unit tests)? 
I'm in biotech manufacturing, but this book just helped my automate a spreadsheet process that had been a pain in our side for some time now. It was a great starting source and I still refer back to the videos cause I don't work in a coding related field and forget some things time to time because I'm not constantly using it. Love this book.
My gf told me she'd only forgive me if I wrote I'm sorry a million times. Little did she know... :)
Used django to build a budget reporting intranet site so I don't have to make dozens of reports every month for each department.
Daily traffic reporting from Google Analytics. Saves 15+ minutes. Big issue is that one story page can get tagged under different sections, which means it shows up as different page for GA. My script pulls all the traffic numbers and groups them by uuid. Also a couple of different web scrapers for various tasks. Best one is for weather related school closings. Used to be done manually, ugh. Now it's one command and it scrapes and updates every 10 minutes. I'm going to have to rebuild that one for this winter because we're now HTTPS.
Just looking at the readme, this looks like a more thought out and better implemented library than what I've seen with some other cryptos. Great work.
I use plotnine which is a python implementation of ggplot (https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). It had a steep learning curve, but it’s quite powerful. 
I made a basic fan controller for my GPU. When I switched to Linux I couldn’t use MSI afterburner anymore, and I was too lazy to look for an alternative. What I have works pretty well, even if it is super simple.

You can parse English with NLTK: import nltk groucho_grammar = nltk.CFG.fromstring(""" S -&gt; NP VP PP -&gt; P NP NP -&gt; Det N | Det N PP | 'I' VP -&gt; V NP | VP PP Det -&gt; 'an' | 'my' N -&gt; 'elephant' | 'pajamas' V -&gt; 'shot' P -&gt; 'in' """) sent = ['I', 'shot', 'an', 'elephant', 'in', 'my', 'pajamas'] parser = nltk.ChartParser(groucho_grammar) i = 0 for tree in parser.parse(sent): nltk.draw.tree.TreeView(tree)._cframe.print_to_file('groucho-%d.ps' % i) print(tree) i = i+1 Which results in [these images](https://imgur.com/a/QeVLfB9). I stole this idea and half the code from [here](https://www.nltk.org/book/ch08.html#ex-marx-elephant).
I have automated: 1. Excel based workflow to retrieve data every morning. Which saves 30+ min 2. Web-scrapping to retrieve data and uploads to database to update product related information. Saves about an hour for someone. 3. Currently writing a webapp to automate few other process, which will help everyone, so i dont get asked to do those things.
Yes, Python is good for beginners, but you shouldn't spend time thinking about which language to learn. Just learn one. It's then easy to go to another. By the way if you have any questions, ask me in PM.
I use it to automate data pipelines. The amount of time I've saved doing that is probably incalculable. There are times where I'll have a pretty complicated, muti-step pipe that takes a few hours to run. If I had to sit there and babysit the scripts it would be really monotonous and possibly result in human error. With Python, it can wipe everything and rebuild step by step in exactly the same way. 
I started out myself in python and learned a lot from the language. I would just say that if you are gonna learn python as your first programming language that later on you learn a lower level language like c/c++ so that you understood pointers/memory, because those are important concepts any computer programmer should know. I personally would, if I had to do it all over again, start with c, because c forces you to think about the lower level stuff and you will have a better understanding of how a programming languages actually works. You can build a lot of stuff in python without actually knowing how much of the language actually operates on a lower level, and later on down the road it will trip you up a lot if you don't know that stuff. 
I remember I took a web programming class, and some of the first things we were pushed to learn was Logic/Design Concepts, C#, and C+
Nice. Might be too basic but would love one on If, else elif and nesting
Wrote a script that pulls names and folder locations from an excel sheet. Then automates Firefox to add, update, or delete users on all our copy machine address books through their web interfaces. Saves probably 10 minutes per user. Also saves me from tedious and repetitive typing. 
I wrote this bot for type racer that would run continuously and I got in like the top place for 24hour leaderboard for like a couple weeks in a row. It used splinter to get scrape the browser elements, and I had to use pytesseract to scrape the text, because they were using html canvas. Then I just set a specific delay between each key stroke to not get caught by cheat detection and set it to run on an infinite loop. 
&gt; Wrote a script that polls their website for new showtimes and sends me an email with links to buy. &gt; &gt; I'm curious where you host (AWS? Heroku?) this as well as the code
I have a pretty simple bot that I host on Heroku. It's quite painless, though I can't speak for AWS as I've never used it. 
I am software tester so I wrote simple script which opens the browser and Jira, create a bug report, fill the form, etc. Simple run in command line :)

&gt;What's the purpose of this blockchain? The same as any other blockchain: to wow your management and potential investors with buzzwords
How would you go about doing that? Do you need to write python that accesses low level software or is there some package that helps you do that? Seems like a nifty project
You could also use a basic DigitalOcean Droplet
I had to input three values on an online form, download the resulting files, analyze them and write a report in a *.docx table; all this for hundreds of files. I wrote a wrapper for the web api to input all the values for me and a small CLI that would open the files prompting me to input the analysis; then everything would be automatically rendered with bootstrap and copy-pasted in Word. Plus side: all the data was saved in a simple SQLite db with a small API to render/jsonize the whole thing also for statistical purposes. Took me two days to write. Not sure how much time I saved, but sure as hell I saved myself from a stupid-ass task that would’ve given me a headache; plus I’ll have to do that again in the near future, so more time saving to come.
Our high school distributes substitutions in a pdf on our e-classroom. I use a script to download it automatically, and then display it with a widget on my home screen. Saves me about half an hour a day searching.
Could you explain what a data pipeline is to a noob like me?
Because I couldn’t find 0.9.0. I was curious as to whether a - much - earlier version of Python would still compile and run, and if I could produce some similar code. I was surprised to find the string builtins in their own Python module, and also no basic types for strings or integers despite int(n) working.
I've been trying to break into the industry for a little over a year now, and I've spent most of my time writing scripts for friends (who don't work in tech, but work on computers) to make their jobs easier. I've saved them hundreds, if not thousands, of work-hours on everything from web scraping to database building / merging / management. They think it's wizardry. I don't know how to properly include it in a resume. 
github to github enterprise migrations of a ~100 repo org i cannot fucking imagine how long it would have taken to do that by hand
Back in college there was a storm that triggered tornado warnings around campus and I was checking twitter to see if it was near my apartment. I realized I was only looking for three variables: tweets with the keyword (tornado), tweets that said something about a location, and the time between each tweet in the 'latest' search field. I figured I could probably automate that search process, and make a program tweet whenever there were enough tweets per second with a keyword. At the time I was suppose to study for my finals, and that sounded like more fun, so I wrote it. It didn't save my any time though sadly. 
`[send_sms(gf_phone_num, "I'm sorry.") for _ in range(1_000_000)]` Service charges may apply.
I have automated mainly tasks I need sometimes to do in the chemistry lab, like exporting some analysis data, a helper to calculate all possible fragments that you can get after injecting synthetic DNA in a mass spec, and convert a list of chemical compounds with one functional group to another.

Did you run the code in her browser? :) 
Post what code you can on github publicly. Include "portfolio" or similar on your resume. Have a good readme for each project
I set up pycharm's file watcher plugin to run "black" every time I save a python file. I'm very happy with the results. Everything just magically works and looks great.
Wrote a script to get answers for an online quiz, If won they divide the prize money to all the winners(loco app) script basically captures the screenshot of a question only the required aspect ratios and apply OCR on it, Search the text over google and find the most matching keyword for options. I have won a got amount of money but now I have stopped :) Modules used are pyscreenshot, pytesseract, PIL, cv2, Urllib, beautifulsoup, requests, webbrowser
I work as WordPress plugins tester. For each plugin I have to set up a new site, did some configuration (click, click) and start testing. I wrote the script which does it for me, automates actions in the browser (splinter in use). To set up the page, before this automation, it took me like 15 minutes per site. Now it is 10 seconds of typing the script name plus some command line parameters and 5 minutes to wait (while I actually does other things not bothered by the installation process)
Yep, turns out not every entry has a pubDate attribute :/
Github. Paste a link to your github in your CV/Résumé under a section called "Projects".
Yes, but there are some caveats: -App processes go to sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity. -Apps get 550 hours of uptime, shared across all apps in your account. Adding a credit card gets you 1000 hours. 
WMI [This is a good place to start](http://timgolden.me.uk/python/wmi/index.html)
That actually gave me a giggle.
I was considering applying for a pre-doc assistant job at my university, but the positions are posted seperatly on the different law faculties websites. Instead of checking every faculties website once a week, I wrote a scrip to search the all once a day and e-mail me any new ones.

gotta put that sleep in and print random.random*1 typing so it doesnt just shit it out
I made a bot that makes fun of Australians, calls me Father, and doesn't crash; it has saved me about -8 hrs so far.
I have a GTX1080 with the proprietary NVIDIA drivers. It provides some command line interfaces to access the card. Here's a snippet: `def call_pipe(arg):` `return run(arg,stdout=PIPE,stderr=PIPE,universal_newlines=True,shell=True)` &amp;#x200B; `def set_auto(tf):` `call_pipe("nvidia-settings -a [gpu:0]/GPUFanControlState="+str(tf))` &amp;#x200B; `def set_fan(speed):` `call_pipe("nvidia-settings -a [gpu:0]/GPUFanControlState=1")` `return call_pipe("nvidia-settings -a [fan:0]/GPUTargetFanSpeed="+str(speed))` &amp;#x200B; `def query_gpu():` `ret = {}` `x = call_pipe("nvidia-smi -q")` `x = x.stdout` `ret['temp'] = int(qt.findall(x)[0])` `ret['speed'] = int(qf.findall(x)[0])` `return ret` &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Not the comment OP, but say you have a bunch of images with metadata. You need to resize the images to 800x600, apply a watermark, collate them into a PDF, dump the metadata from each image into a CSV file and then pack everything into a zip file. You can think of all of these operations as a parts of a pipeline through which the data flows to get to the end. Doing all of these steps by hand would be tedious and time consuming - scripting it in Python would be much faster and less prone to error.
Made a Discord bot that reminds me whenever a new episode of an anime series that I like airs (with the ability to add more of course, though admittedly handling series ending was a bigger pain in the neck than anticipated). It also has the ability to search for 'good' images from certain websites (pixiv and danbooru to be precise) based on tags and work safety. Hosted on a Raspberry Pi.
This is pretty interesting, going to sign up. 
I'm a Motion Designer who occasionally writes scripts to improve pipeline/workflow. My favourite is FFmpegify ( https://github.com/Aeoll/FFmpegify ) which converts image sequences to videos via the right click menu in your file explorer. This avoids the hassle of opening media encoder/handbrake just to save simple previews. I probably use it at least 5-10x a day. I've also written scripts for loading SVGs into my 3D package, saving incremented versions of scene files, and 'collecting' a project by copying all referenced files into a single folder - making it portable.
Chatbot(FBM) test case execution automation. Saved almost 70% of time.
Yeah I use airflow as part of my job so, quite literally, I use python for automation. In fact, one of my key performance indicators is the reduction of “manual” data work done by other teams
Checking 10 to 30 servers a day for specific build parameters and collecting the artifacts for our records. About 20 minutes per server saved, so anywhere from 3 to 10 hours approx per day
This is kind of awesome though, we just got stuff about how to use word processors and had to learn programming ourselves. 
Surely, just classical GUI apps for mac or windows ?
&gt; in range(1_000_000) &gt; 1_000_000 What in the fuck is this abomination?
Yes, install python, and in VSCode install python extension and you're good to go.
Python now supports using under score as a thousand separator in numeric literals
You can add as many underscores as you want wherever you want in numbers to increase readability. They have no effect on the number.
If you have worked with classes you can subclass str and implement some of these in an odd way https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#emulating-numeric-types You could for example make this your goal by implementing __sub__() &gt;&gt;&gt;s = YourSubClass("Hello World!") &gt;&gt;&gt;s - " World!" &gt;&gt;&gt;print(s) Hello
I'm a Devops Engineer, and I often use digital Ocean as my developmenet environement for testing things out, mainly with ansible, so I create a CLI tool that provision droplets, and that can create an inventory file, and install some packages after provisionning , https://github.com/ayoubensalem/dopr
When using schemas, is there still a point to use JSON over XML ? I guess this question is not specific to your implementation which seems to be a fine library but still I would like your input on this subject.
TIL, but still it's terrifying.
She was upset I forgot to reply to her message after leaving her on seen for an hour.
Django, flask
I automated apartment searching by scraping relevant data from a website and displaying it in a convinient way by generating a web page using requests, beautiful soup and yattag. Planned to develop some kind of notification system but found a place before that)
Why? It's a pretty common feature. It's also in Java, Rust, Swift, Perl, D, Eiffel, Nim, Julia, D, Ada, Verilog, VHDL, ... and many others I'm sure.
In pycharm, with html code, you press cmd+alt+shift+L and it formats the file, try that. 
I am, actually. My app listens for requests from IFTTT, but since the requests that I actually want come infrequently and can be lost while the dyno spins back up, I have IFTTT sending my app requests every half hour to keep the dyno's uptime at virtually 100%. 
Flask is like express, django is even bigger and more features. Nothing in python land is like angular/react because only javascript/webassembly runs in the browser and only javascript/webassembly can modify the DOM. So you can make an app replacing express with flask pretty easily but you'll still have to do javascript in the front end, whether its angular, jquery or whatever. 
I know this is possible, but how/where do you crossover from internet channels to sms channels?
I have very the same opinion as written on JSON.org here: [http://www.json.org/xml.html](http://www.json.org/xml.html) JSON is human readable, easy to use, not redundant (more efficient) and very good for exchanging data. XML is good for exchanging documents. You can use JSON without any schema and when you need to validate it against some specification, there is JSON schema. Which means it doesn't matter what you will need in the future, you can use JSON for all purposes and have only one format instead of more of them.
Have you ever played Tribal wars and wondered.. Should I upgrade warehouse, wood camo or headquarters? I did. So I made a script that simulates every possible sequence of upgrading buildings in tribal wars and then picks the fastest one.
Twillio is a common one
Data scrapers to download well data and production from various state websites. Log classifier that lists pertinent .las file info so I don’t have to search through hundreds of files/folders by hand. No clue how much time I’ve saved for myself and company... probably a lot.
Scripting it in (any language) would be much faster ...,, 
 A pipeline is basically a series of steps Ergo, a data pipeline is a series of steps with data
Yes, I would. I use it everywhere I need to validate JSON schema. It has all features from JSON schema drafts 04, 06 and 07 and is fast as a bonus (it was the main goal). Other implementations don't have all features and are slow. That's why I'm spreading a word about it so people can find it when needed. :-) Stability is good. There can be a bug in some edge case which no one noticed before. Several bugs were fixed already and I will keep maintain it. No new feature or change is in the work. My library already supports latest JSON schema draft 07 and it have all needed features for validating data. Library is tested on many projects, including high-load project. That's why it's stable and ready for production.
Both of the responses so far have been spot on. Specifically in my case, we will have data sources that are (basically) always in the same format (which is, usually, a horrible mess as healthcare data is prone to be). We also have research that needs to be updated. So when new data comes in, we want to make sure we're running exactly the same process so that the results are consistent. Otherwise we'd potentially be comparing, in the best case, a different data set, and at worst case an incorrect dataset. Basically, when you apply exclusions, aggregate data, widen etc. It isn't uncommon for the order to matter too. For example, if we have some type of measurement with data that is missing... I can impute the data. Height doesn't vary all that much after 18 so if I have the data elsewhere I can put it there but I won't do it if I have some measurement elsewhere that uses that calculation. Tl;dr -&gt; Python makes it easy to make sure that I apply rules consistently so that research is more accurate.
I've heard a lot of good things about Airflow. I really need to check it out. I just finally got into SQLAlchemy this weekend and am super jazzed about it too. Object-orientation is so much quicker and database agnostic. How have I not been using it this whole time!?
I just use JSON since I can directly convert between JSON and Python dictionaries using the standard library module "json". It really doesn't get any simpler than json.dumps() and json.loads().
Wiping trash, trash log folder, logs, zsh history, and a few others. 
Thanks. Let me know if you have suggestions/feedback. 
Lol that is infuriating. I'm my opinion that "seen"/"read" shit is an invasion of privacy. 
I wrote the app that do scraping last played tracks on my favoruite radio and add to my spotify account. In this way, i never miss good musics. https://github.com/boardsofcanada/radio-eksen-spotify
Not something I've done, but my physics course at uni involves learming how to code with python. Anything useful that I should know gettibg in to it. Any shortcuts, tips or just cool things to code for other uses would be pretty neat. Thanks!
but you can disable it...
Not of much use anymore, since I dont' work there any more... I drive a Nissan Leaf. About a block from my old office there is a [Chargepoint](https://www.chargepoint.com/) charger that's free to use. There's quite a bit of contention for the free electricity; they were almost always in use. At lunch someone would frequently unplug and leave. I wrote a script to access the Chargepoint API (every 60 seconds - they never complained!) and as soon as it saw a state change from "busy" to "free" it sent me a text message. I'd zip over there and plug in for the free electricity. It didn't save me much time, but allowed me to beat everyone else to the chargers and get the free juice! This was paying for half of my commuting costs.
That's actually a topic I'm planning to cover in the near future, probably in the next two weeks or so.
I've mentioned this before, but I automate fantasy baseball on ESPN using Python. My code drafts my teams for me and then manages those teams through the season, adding and dropping players as necessary. I draft 25 teams each year. 15 of those teams follow an optimal strategy, and 10 of those teams use an exploratory strategy. The results from the 10 exploratory teams are meant to improve next year's optimal teams. Each auction draft takes about 3 hours, so automating 25 drafts saved me about 75 hours of time this year. I set my lineups every day, and it takes about 15 minutes per day per team to do that manually. Over the course of about 180 days, my best guess is that automation saved me about 1,125 hours of time I would have spent setting lineups. The MLB season ended yesterday, and ESPN hasn't updated their leaderboard yet. As of Sunday morning, I had nine teams in the worldwide top 50, including the #1 overall team. When ESPN updates results later this morning, I might have #1 and #2. [http://games.espn.com/flb/resources/leaderboard](http://games.espn.com/flb/resources/leaderboard) &amp;#x200B;

Not yet, but I am considering making the code public before next season. 
Hello! I am new to Python, so yesterday I pick up a project for learning it. I am working on "the coolest password manager in the universe". It's a terminal program that saves different login credentials in a vault (JSON file). I have already finished the core of it (user inputs and some functions like read specific credential, save new one, etc) The challenging part comes now, I need to, somehow, encrypt the file in a way that it can only be decrypted with the program. I am investigating how VeraCrypt works and see if I am able to apply something else. After that, I want to have a 2FA, Google Auth or see if I can create a file to work as a key. Cheers.
That's cool. I have been messing with Hassbian and some other sensors and I would never have thought to use magnets. Good thinking. 
Searching and download 10000 images with fire objects from internet. The process only need a day. I have been save time about a month with python to automate it.
Take a look at https://developer.cisco.com/site/pyats/ Its what engineering teams use within cisco to do their automation. Pm me for more information. 
I don't think anyone has answered why it is useful? But one use is string cleaning. For example, you can create a translation table with maketrans and (string.punctuation)[https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html] to remove all the punctuation from a string. It is useful because it is performant as the mapped translation operates in C? Performance with large volumes of unstructured text data is often an issue. 
On my home PC, I have a library of photos and some other documents that weighs some 200 GB. It contained a lot of duplicates which cluttered the structure and took up over 15 GB. I have written a crawler that removed those duplicates (matching by size and hash) by some unsophisticated rules (dates and names, occasionally some path conditions). I'm not sure how much time that saved me because I probably wouldn't even bother trying to do this by hand.
1 tool I remembered... We were producing animation for games . We had our own in-house versioning system and our file name looked something like this. knight\_walk\_this.v032 knight\_swing\_that.v016 When submitting for client review however, they want the version to reflect how many files they've received. So my artist colleagues are putting everything in spread sheet and track all the versioning by hands... files we sent each time can be in hundreds and they'd spend 6-7 hours each time they have to send files to client. They had been doing that for a while before I found out, then I wrote them a little Python script to take care of all the versioning for them, shortening their time from 6 hours to 6 minutes.
I created a script to aggregate PDF scans of quotes and estimates, flip them upright if they were horizontally oriented, perform image processing to prepare them for Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and then digitize the PDF scans into raw CSVs. I don't know how much time I saved, because it was my first "real" attempt at something useful that I feel was worthwhile. I can imagine I saved accounting/auditing a lot of man hours they were NEVER going to invest in digitizing their archives.
Data is a mess in my company and in many different systems. So I've automated gathering of inputs, aggregation, and output. I work in a Risk department, so heavily aids in gathering everything I need to run analytics. Saved me or an analyst probably 2+ hours a day.
Use context managers when possible. It is those "with" things. http://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/context_managers.html
Ah, pypdf2. I take it those aren't very complex PDFs. Neat though!
Converting data entries for 2400000000 lines of data It's not even possible to this manually; so the automation time is only about 29 hours.
There's your problem. Write a script to auto reply. Always go after the root cause of a problem, and you will never have a problem in the future!
Its pretty simple for what it does but is limited to short sequences (depends on RAM and CPU, as its very naive): https://github.com/Vassyli/biofragmentor The conversion was mostly just applied RDKit and SMARTS (SMILES for reactions). I can put it together on gist, but its essentially the same as the one described in the RDKit manual.
I played that game so many years ago. Absolutely loved it. I don't know what tools are available for the game now, but there wasn't anything at the time. It was still new. I was in high school and I would plan out elaborate strategies for attacking and defending. I ended up with over 100 villages before I quit. I'll always have fond memories of that game.
Developed scripts and applications in Python to improve workplace efficiency. If you want a short version.
My company uses airflow, it is great in theory but I think we overload it or maybe the data team set it up improperly. It breaks at least once a week.
My entire job is automating things for our ops teams. The two big wins lately: * Automated our paperwork around when a server crashes unexpectedly. Probably saves 5-10 minutes of work per crash. When you have a lot of servers, this adds up * Automated kicking off tasks in AWX. We have a process that our ops team kicks off regularly via AWX and if you've ever used it, you know its UI can be a little frustrating. Now its a single chatops command I also automate fun stuff with python: * Every emoji added to our company slack gets "partified" - animated with a color pallet that looks like the party-parrot emojis * Every employee gets their own custom emoji from our employee headshots I also automated my wedding: * Python w/ twilio to send out save the dates via texts saved us a ton of time and money * Setup a quick flask app + twilio to allow folks to "RSVP" via text messages. More $$ and time saved * Used python to manipulate our guest lists to generate all kinds of data to help with planning 
At least you must be an intermediate to advanced level developer to sell your services. Otherwise when presented to the market you’ll have to back off and earn bad reputation. I still don’t benefit from python nor programming at all. Start github repos, make projects, make *group* projects, learn web backend management, data scraping and databases, SQL, and learn ALL the libraries and frameworks you can. Help others, answer questions, earn reputation in StackOverflow. I know. This sounds like a lot. Trust me, it’s really not that much. If you have free time, learning this stuff shall take you no longer than a regular programming course. Just make projects and finish them. All the time and not more than two at a time. Focus a lot until you feel like you can do anything you could possibly be asked for. 
Is the theater Marcus?
You're not wrong, but this is the Python subreddit, and we are talking about Python right now. Perhaps you could post a topic asking about instances where Python is not the most appropriate solution?
Personal finances. Not totally automated, but enough to save time. I have a script that reads in all GnuCash files in a directory, lets me know if there are any transactions that are past their posted date but not cleared. It also reads in a CSV file I download from my bank and compares to the data in GnuCash and reports any transactions that are missing from GnuCash. I even automated the CSV download using Selenium. It then uses JSON files to create accounts and expenses for next year. Finally, it creates an Excel document so I can see (roughly) how much I still owe on my car and on my student loans, taking the extra payments in GnuCash into account.
A script to parse HTML content and notify me by telegram whenever there is a new chapter of my following mangas. If run locally I can toggle it to auto open web browser to the new chapter page. If there is a new site with new structure to add, it takes me less then 2 minutes to add them by simply get the css selectors. Otherwise, just reuse the old one, so 20 secs. Work perfectly for years.
Sounds great, have not been that happy with existing json schema libraries. 
I had a boss who wanted a weekly email on what progress had been made on various tickets. We had a LOT of tickets in our system, so this took up more time than you'd think. So, I wrote a script to pull down a copy of the database (I couldn't directly query it), look at the history for each ticket in our current release, group them by certain changes, create an email that looked like it had been hand crafted, and then somewhere around 11am, send it to my boss. She was convinced that I spent my Friday mornings putting together this report by hand. I got a chance to actually do the work that needed to get done (and indulge in office scuttlebutt) rather than frown at reports.
Wrote an Electrical Engineering toolbox because we used Excel at school and Excel sucks ass. Prolly didn't save any time (yet)
Hey no big, you pointing me in the right direction is more then enough. Thanks a lot, I'll be going down this rabbit hole this week =D super stoked. Thanks! 
WSL has removed 99% of my desire to move to Linux as my main OS. 
yeah this was my point
why are you being fed data that needs to be transformed non-trivially if you have any level of responsibility of doing something with that data is my question i guess? seems like a waste of your time
Well I should clarify. It looks terrible. Not that the concept itself is terrible, I see it certainly makes sense in various scenarios.
I haven't played too much around with it, but I imagine podbeuter (part of newsbeuter) would do a similar if not identical job.
How would you do it? The only reasonable alternative I can come up with is spaces `1 000 000`, and I suspect that would require big changes to the parser. 
I write fantasy novels and Python is a big part of my tool chain. One script runs every hour, finds all my projects and makes offsite backups of them, logging project word counts along the way. Another runs every night and sends me a report of daily word count production and a list of any new typos found in the files. It's hard to quantify how much time these save, but it's a lot. (Especially when you factor in how big a productivity disruption it would be to stop writing every hour and do these things manually.) I have another that scrapes book review sites (Amazon, Goodreads, Nook, etc) and notifies me of any new reviews of my books. And another that pulls reports from my vendor sites and gives me weekly aggregate sales updates. Combined, these easily save me two or three hours per week. The biggest helper though, is my production script, which takes my manuscript files and turns them into Epub and Kindle ebooks and a PDF file for print. A process that used to take two or three days now takes about 10 minutes. This script also allows me to update my books quickly when content changes, like when a typo gets discovered or my list of "other books by this author" expands. I can't really quantify how much time Python saves me, because many of these things it does for me are things I just wouldn't bother doing if I had to do it by hand. But as an estimate, it probably saves me about one day per week.
Not without some effort to replace the sensitive stuff. 
A small script to rename photos based on info in the exif. Don't know how much time it saves - wouldn't attempt to do it manually. 
I'm not saying anything, more asking for point of views. I myself like to work with JSON a lot for many things from applications configuration to API response format. One domain it doesn't fit though is text encoding (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_Encoding_Initiative).
Why are majority of posts not saying how much time they've saved?
Wrong. Blockchains have real uses and implications. Just because we're not all out here giving you the gravy doesn't mean we're not working hard on cool solutions.
Dozens of languages have supported this for years and years. 
Personally, I'm trying to put together automation for our onboarding that powershell can't do by itself. So far, I'm at around 600 lines of code and 4 modules in my python project. Powershell doesn't have a module like pywingui for example (afaik). I'm in the process of trying to get selenium to work with powershell but it's not as nice as the python version. Powershell can be great for a lot of things and is generally my first tool but python is a lot more versatile. At the end of the day, it's one of the most popular/recommended books on python for beginners and it seems to help others.
Very cool. Would love to hear about what your inputs were... How were lineups optimized, how stats were weighted, etc. Is the automation's success due to really picking the best teams (that a human generally wouldn't) or because it consistently does all the tedious things a human generally wouldn't do (fantasy baseball is the most tedious of all fantasy sports).
yeah but none of what you said would be in any way comprehensible to a "beginner" or even someone who had memorized this entire course. no bueno for actual programmers. you knew what you had to do and reached for a tool. this course is trying to teach beginners how to hold a tool. not great for people reaching for tools akin to handing "how to hammer nails for dummies" to a carpenter
Is this the one in Battery Park in NYC? I had a friend who saw Crazy Rich Asians on this deal but I cant remember the theater.
Can't find it, link ?
I used to check all of our backups, email notifications, admin panels, etc for information on the backup systems we use. It used to take roughly an hour everyday to put everything I needed into Excel, then export to PDF and email out. I found both vendors we used had APIs, so I wrote my python script to pull from each API, parse the information I needed, then save as XLSX. I still open each report by hand to look it over, then I export to PDF and email out. So my daily 1 hour is down to 2 minutes; or 261 hours a year is down to 8.7 hours.
add tracks posted to r/hiphopheads to a spotify playlist, its a very active community and pretty easy to miss posts. 
I'm working on r/https://newreleases.io, web service that sends notifications about new version releases on PyPI, GitHub, Docker, NPM... Any fidback is much appreciated. ☺️
I volunteer for an organization that hosts robotics events. We upload a lot of matches over the course of an event and we used to dedicate a single volunteer to handle it. Now we just use a python program I wrote that makes it really easy for anyone to upload the matches, so we usually just have a volunteer do that and other tasks because it is fairly low effort.
Thanks. I must admit that I am not familiar with IFTTT. I did a quick read on wikipedia and understood that it's a free webservice that can trigger actions according to certain actions from other apps or services. Could you please ELI5 the above comment?
This sounds really handy. Sites are picking up on my adblocker and forcing me to pause it to access content. I’ve just started learning Python but want to figure out a way around this.
The success is due to lineup optimization, and that optimization involves both: (1) valuing players in a way that most humans don't. (2) making tedious lineup changes that humans don't like to do. I'm most proud of the automated drafting. ESPN uses the WebSocket protocol for its drafts, so I had to learn about websockets and reverse engineer their implementation (which is nonstandard, I believe) in order to automate my drafts. I use the PuLP library to do real-time optimization during the draft, so my code bids on players in such a way as to maximize projected value given the standard $260 budget. Since the optimization occurs in real time, the bot can respond to situations in which players are going for more or less than their usual values. &amp;#x200B; During the season, my code makes lots of lineup changes every day. There are core players that the bot will never drop, but it adds and drops 60%-70% of my roster on most days to take advantage of favorable matchups. The team that finished first in ESPN's overall rankings made 2667 acquisitions this year, for example. &amp;#x200B;
Ah I love seeing Julia mentioned. To the top we go!
Heroku has the app go to sleep if nothing happens after 30 minutes, so he has ifttt send a request every 30 minutes to keep the app awake. The equivalent of moving your mouse so the screen saver doesnt come on. This is presumably because movie times are only posted once a day so the other inactive 23.5 hours would make the app fall asleep.
Pretty sure they just mean Python isn't the only language you can do this with.
I need to see this comic... link???
I was JUST about to buy half of those books linked on this site. This community is such a blessing. 
I'm strictly a hobbyist but have written a couple of scripts for work - one that automates posting links to our main Twitter feed (because there was nothing in the budget to keep using [dlvr.it](https://dlvr.it) once they started charging). But the real timesaver is a script that automates inviting people who've liked posts on our Facebook page to like the page itself. It's a busy page and this task used to easily take over an hour of someone's time every day, and even then we were missing lots of invites. The script let us catch up on thousands of old invites that we'd missed, and now I just run it daily and it whirs away in the background inviting a couple of dozen people each time.
Hah! I would have said exactly the same thing a week ago. It'll probably fade to some extent but at least for creating the data models and inserting mock data, its been great! We'll see if querying is the same but even still a hybrid between the two makes it easy to build a consistent architecture
I'm a bit of a noob but how did you access the API and how did Nissan not have a problem with that?
This is really neat code, thanks!
If you guys like automation, you should play factorio.
Cool checked out the site. Do you only have 3 video tutorials on youtube? or are they some place else? 
I remember finding jsonschema a little lacking before. IIRC there were certain situations where it didn't really work (e.g. situations where you wanted to treat two different types as equally valid). Kudos on making this very fast though. It looks nice.
did you come up with an inhouse website list to check? or just google alerts?
It's the Chargepoint API, since they operate the charging stations. The API documentation is here: [https://na.chargepoint.com/UI/downloads/en/ChargePoint\_Web\_Services\_API\_Guide\_Ver4.1\_Rev4.pdf](https://na.chargepoint.com/UI/downloads/en/ChargePoint_Web_Services_API_Guide_Ver4.1_Rev4.pdf) I ended up stealing some code I found somewhere on Github (here: [https://github.com/nicholasrobinson/ChargePoint-Scraper](https://github.com/nicholasrobinson/ChargePoint-Scraper)) and wrapping up his functions and classes my way. Now, why Chargepoint doesn't rate-limit the pulls, I can't imagine. I'd get to work at 09:00 and see all the plugs were full (actually, I'd check via the phone app as I was getting close). I'd sit down at my desk and crank up my script which would hit their API every minute. Sometimes this would go on for hours! Never heard a complaint from 'em!
&gt; When using schemas, is there still a point to use JSON over XML ? There's rarely a good reason to use XML. It's an unnecessarily complicated format and that complication causes headaches and bugs that you simply wouldn't see with JSON.
What a great post. If only we were all so self aware.
What sensors are you using? I have an r-pi running my garage door.... the r-pi &amp; relays were cheaper than replacing the dead keypad from Sears! Right now I'm running a little php script under Apache that just has a button to actuate the door. For v2.0 of my garage door I'd like to: 1. Add sensors so I know if it's open or closed. Then I can add 'cat-mode' which is where we leave the garage open 8 - 12 inches so the cats can come sleep in the garage if they don't come home before I go to bed. 2. Rewrite the UI using [REMI](https://github.com/dddomodossola/remi) so I can put the cat-mode button in, as well as eliminate Apache. &amp;#x200B;
Wow. Interesting. I guess if not many people are doing it you'd be ok.
Link to git?
Yeah but that's pretty rare these days, I'd say extremely so.
I don't remember the exact model, but they are just simple magnetic reed switches. If you look up reed switch you can find them for super cheap and they are really easy to use with minimal electronics knowledge. You could have two separate reed switches and have one for cat mode and one for normal open/close mode
I'm driving right now or else I'd send some links lol
At work a team had a custom Linux service that would sometimes die and then the file system would fill up with log files. I wrote a script which would would as a cronjob every 15 minutes checking the size of the directory with all the log files. If it was over 1GB, the script would restart the service and delete all but the 10 most recent logs. Our monitor for this alert would only check every 15 minutes and the check had to pass twice, so after fixing the issue it could take as long as 45 minutes before the alert turned green and the ticket cloud be closed. After writing my script I never saw the alert fire again. 
https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32 http://timgolden.me.uk/python/wmi/tutorial.html Lot of stuff there to read through regarding manipulating Windows using Python. &gt;modifying chrome to be the default browser https://superuser.com/questions/1223126/cmd-command-to-set-chrome-as-default-browser-windows-10 Do the Powershell commands at the end of that link work? If so, you could use Python and `subprocess` or `os.system` to call them. &gt;removing IE from being pinned on the taskbar You used to be able to just remove the IE entry under the folder `%AppData%\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch\User Pinned\TaskBar\`. I don't think it works any more, but you can try it. Might have to log out and back in for it to take effect. 
idk how well-suited Python is for this, but the real solution would be roaming profiles
I just have a $5/month server from Digital Ocean that I use for a variety of things. I just run my script via cron on an interval. Heroku is great for hobby stuff and I could probably get away with this for free. AWS scales the best for price IMO, but was more work than I wanted just to get this going.
Yup. Just a simple cron entry.
Nope. I’m in Utah.
Thanks for posting this. TIL about Humble Bundle and lots of interesting books.

I guess when and how to use decorators might be something that's noy necessarily straight forward for someone who's never written code before but at the same time that's probably an advanced topic for your purposes
always recommend github desktop when recommending github to noobs. the push/pull/merge methodology intimidates career professionals let alone a noob
if what you say is true, they honestly pay more due to you ddos-ing them than they pay for in terms of free electricity, way to stick it to the man
ha in 1.2 seconds tell me how many zero's there are in this number &gt; 10000000000 
damn i find it so much more satisfying writing little programs like these instead of say, writing a low level linux kernel patch or working on some microsoft C# library internally at MSFT. I guess making software tools doesnt bring as much joy as building a useful end-user tool that saves some band of merry office workers painful repetitive drudgery.
Take a look at [string.Template](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/string.html#template-strings) or template language engine like [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/) 
I also want to check this out... Are you trying to tell me *they* are putting executable code in the pdf's so that when you run the install it calls to malicious code? Would greatly appreciate a little follow-up on this one.
Does github desktop help get your head round push/pull etc terminology? 
Dude, basically you have your own business. just put Software Development Consultant as the title. then get creative in bullet points saying which tasks were completed, what languaes used (use python!) and give some % stat increases, like increased user processing time from 10m to 30s. (dont say its only for 2 users, your neighbours living down the road at 45 blue leaf drive) apply for junior development positions. or positions where u rub up against excel ecosystem in company and then continue inserting scripts into the company workflow
what was language of choice? python? did you try tosplit up the data into multiple sources and use a map reduce implementation? elixir genstage producer/consumer can scale across many cores, kinda niche though and not helpful on resume.
it's obviously not a denial of service attack but it is more expensive than you'd think esp if they're using a cloud service for the api(which they probably are). 
No time has ever been saved if you tally up the time taken to implement, fix, implement and support the automation rather than just doing the thing as per xkcd 1319
I've never had to work for free, my friends understand my situation and always insisted on paying me a decent rate for my time (they're good people, I'm thankful). I think you, as well as the others who've replied, have the right idea and I really like the wording you used. I'm definitely going to work this into my resume, and I'll put some of my older projects up on GitHub, maybe with some redacted code to limit functionality and keep the specifics my friends' workflows private. Thanks for the tips!!
my last project was * django for everything * [intercoolerjs](http://intercoolerjs.org/) to get my 'atomic' views embedded into the webpage (i.e. a view that only serves an inline form which is loaded by pressing on a table row and replaces this element) this makes it possible to pretty much do everything on the backend and fully utilize djangos templating language 
i doubt each request took more than ~10ms, but lets be generous and use 100 as that makes it easy to price on aws. now we're at $0.000000208 per request. please tell me were you get your electricity....
I'm with similar background. I've used Flask successfully for the backend, for building API-s. However - for you with JS background the async small brother of Flask would make more sense - the Quart framework. Await/async FTW!😎
Split the filename using **.** and then extract the last element tokens = filename.split('.') file_ext = tokens[-1] return file_ext 
Love GnuCash! Would you be willing to share your code?
Yeah, but that's only gonna make it worse. Assume that your default response is "yes, dear" or similar. The first time she queries "can you meet me at my parents in an hour?" and you don't show you will not get out of it with a mere million new culpas.
You probably want to ask in /r/learnpython. That being said check out the documentation for the string class and split() in particular. 
I thoroughly enjoyed this and learned some things
This is silliness. Six hundred people could be running that script 24/7 and it still wouldn’t bump you out of the free tier of AWS lamba if you went serverless. And any free tier server from AWS or Google Cloud or whatever could also handle that traffic, so long as it’s evenly distributed without major traffic spikes.
Good bot.
&gt; so long as it’s evenly distributed without major traffic spikes. you mean like someone continuously polling the service every minute for hours every day? you assume highly optimised when that is the prize rarity in this industry esp when dealing with corporate behemoths.
We were looking for a new apartment for rent and we had to be really fast to get a good deal. We didn't have time to check all the listings everyday, so I had to figure out something. I've created a search with our preferences (location, price, rooms etc.) on the most popular website and checked the request my browser sent. Then I've created a script that polls the site for new listings with that request and it sent an email every 2 hours with the details and the url of the listing. It was running on a raspberry pi and it sent 3-4 new apartments in each email. The site that I'm talking about doesn't offer such service, only a daily email update with the "featured" listings. We are now living in a flat that we got in on of the emails and we were the first to see the apartment, so it was worth :) The script was running for about a month and we saved a few hours daily. It was a lot for us. Can't wait to find something new to automate!
Use [Hypothesis](https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis) - it's good enough for Ethereum... 
I tried to do that but I got a trace back error. What would the whole program look like? Thank you so much!!
I made a xlsx splitter which splits source with one sheet and a lot of data by selected column and saves it in the new file with sheets or with a several files (every sheet is a separate file) for my coworkers. Saves them few hours a week I believe. 
Does it support Python 2?
Hey everyone! We open sourced `apiron` today (you can read more about that [here](https://medium.com/build-smarter/open-sourcing-apiron-1f2010393675)) and I would love for you to try it, use it, and let us know what you like/dislike.
It is very much achievable. The thing is you have to keep pushing. To achieve what you want, you will need to break down your problem into small parts. Then search the internet to finish each part. The way I see your project can be broken down to the following parts: * How to check for wifi state using Python? * This can be done using Invoke/subprocess. * Or simply trying to ping a website using requests library. If the request fails, then wifi is down. * If the wifi is down, then how to restart it? * Again, you can use Invoke which can be used to execute local commands. Similarly you can use subprocess for that. * Reloading the webpage. * TBH, I don't much idea about this. But selenium might one way to achieve this. * Running the script periodically. * Use cron feature of Raspbian. * Learn to use logging. * I found this tutorial helpful: [https://realpython.com/python-logging/](https://realpython.com/python-logging/)
The error interface seems to be lacking and the non-standard regex format is a deal breaker if you want to publish the schema. I'll give in a try for internal things but those 2 issues are kind of a big deal.
I wrote a class to interact with Microsoft’s webservice and generate entries for various network equipment for Office 365 access. It will stop someone from needing to update ~ 500 entries in three places once a month so I estimate anywhere up to 20 hours a month once you factor in change control. 
I've currently got 75 ESPN fantasy football teams. ESPN's fantasy football API is very similar to the fantasy baseball API, so it was pretty easy to move from baseball to football. &amp;#x200B; For football, I just use aggregated projections/rankings to draft and set lineups. There is some much randomness in 16-game regular seasons that I don't believe it's possible to build a good predictive model for the NFL.
Had to laugh at this..I just had to do it &amp;#x200B;
My club on campus runs many events a week that we post about on Facebook, Gmail and calendar. I've automated most of that away with a raspberry pi. Saving about 10 minutes of work for every event, 1-5 times a week, almost every week a year. I just need to finish it where the system is closed looped and the raspberry pi can post to Facebook instead of from my laptop.
HQ?
Data collection across the complete environment with regards to storage use and allocation, and backup storage use and configuration all across multiple software and hardware vendor types, and then the compilation of this data and analysis to produce reports showing current cost of ownership and occupancy rates for different data types as compared to projected cost of ownership and occupancy rates given alternative target software and storage hardware. Turned around a task in two man weeks that would normally take 6 man months at least. At the same time we built a company doing it. Then sold it. Python is awesome!
Yes, but the point still stands that this is a Python subreddit, and this post is asking specifically about tasks being automated with Python. It's like going into a thread titled "how do I use apples to make cider" and somebody responding with "you can just do it with pears!" Like great, that's probably true (I don't know jack about ciders), but it's off topic and nobody asked about pears.
hey don't trample all over my buzzwords!
Pillow. Probably intermediate bit still.
Looks really clean!
Glad to hear it! We tried to shoot for as little code as possible to get the common use cases working, while still making it possible to do more.
Yeah I feel you. I thought there was confusion about what op was saying so I wanted to clear it up, not defending the shitposter
Add another one to the list. Can always use more pyqt tutorials. :)
Please use /r/learnpython... from pathlib import Path filename = 'abc.123' path = Path(filename) extension = path.suffix print(extension) print(path.exists()) ... .123 False
Embedding stuff into PDF's has been a thing for a while I think, adobe hasn't had a great track record overall regarding this kinda stuff. AV Scanners will know to scan inside PDF's though, it's not a new trick.
Holy Hungarian notation. 
Input list is a google sheet with all our products (In this case digital music). The script is keeping that list as reference every time it scrapes the target website for appearances of those.
Look for "small" projects with an "implement X function". There are a lot you can complete with having a look at the code.
My favorite, although it doesn't save much time: A raspberry pi with a cron job to scrape my tv show calendar (requests + bs4 modules). The Pi is connected to my PC via ethernet cable. If I have a new show out it WOL's my PC (wifi, too far from the router) at 6am. My pc turns on and a python script runs on startup to force a wifi connection (dodgy wifi dongle, 'auto-connect' doesn't always work) and run a similar tv calendar scraper which passes the show names and ep numbers to a torrent api, and starts the torrent. I have this all happen at 6am as my wifi plan is unlimited downloads between midnight and 8am, so it's almost always finished by the time I wake up. 
At least someone noticed my uh definitely deliberately awful variable names :D
Annotations don't exist in Python 2.
Also check out [Enaml](https://github.com/nucleic/enaml) which I discovered recently. It can use PyQt5 as a rendering backend and it's very easy, quick and fun to create a fully working GUI with it. I wrote a [simple imageviewer](https://i.imgur.com/35GaUL7.png) within 1-2 hours without having prior knowledge of Enaml; It's definitely worth taking a look at.
Automated a handful of web based data entry tasks with Selenium. These all should be built directly against the database but for *reasons* they aren’t built yet. Tricky because the interface is buried deep in a frameset. I should just hit the database directly despite *reasons*.
I think that post data you are sending needs to be a dictionary, you are sending a JSON string. Try converting the keys to have single quotes
How do you get your own dna? I don't trust any companies. Can't i just ask my doctor :))
There are thousands of non tech businesses that have been operating this way for hundreds of years

Maybe [this](https://xkcd.com/208/) one?
Type hinting is only one of [many use cases](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/#use-cases) for annotations. Mypy type hints use annotations but aren't the same thing.
Thanks for posting this! Was looking for something similar, gonna dive right in.
Don't they already let you concatenate string literals with whitespace? I think there can be an argument for concatenating numerical literals in a similar fashion but I imagine that the fact that it can be abused to produce some pretty ugly syntax and may also produce some confusing errors when people make typos would have convinced them not to do it.
Mind sharing some of these tutorials?
With you here.
Interesting. What are you thinking about for documents ?
That Facebook script would be super handy! Could you post it?
That's weird. Take a look at this post [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9733638/post-json-using-python-requests](here)
Why not do something aroun the lines of: `Github.user(username='defunkt')` and `Github.repo(org=github', repo='hub')` would read a lot cleaner. Hint-hint *luke use the metaprogramming*! PS. to OP: before you take this the wrong way, this is purely MY opinion, and you should still be proud of what you've created here!
&gt; r = requests.post(url, data=data, headers=headers) This worked for me. Ha a r = requests.post(url, **json**=data, headers=headers) 
Awesome but still a bit weird because the **json** parameter already specifies that your data is a json string, so you don't need to explicitly pass the headers but glad that worked out!
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!

Yeah. Thanks 
First time playing with Python, but I want to run a script to check and name off who is currently online a Discord server. I'm not sure if their API will allow it, but I'm going to do the research and see what I can find out anyway!
This isn't a tutorial but here is a simple application that uses QML and PyQt5 https://github.com/siecje/qml-testing
I'd argue typing hints is the 95% use case. Outside of astropy, I don't know of anything using function annotations for anything but typing. &gt; PEP 3107 added support for arbitrary annotations on parts of a function definition. **Although no meaning was assigned to annotations then, there has always been an implicit goal to use them for type hinting** [gvr-artima], which is listed as the first possible use case in said PEP. https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/ Additionally, if you look at the plugin code, you'll see the following. Based on that, it's reasonable (although per the OP, it doesn't support it). &gt; """Flake8 plugin to find incorrect type annotation styles.""" https://github.com/sobolevn/flake8-type-annotations/blob/master/flake8_type_annotations.py

On every service with that feature? I don't think so. 
For work, I've saved other people about 440 hours by removing the need to check something that shouldn't be checked. The process is that there is a list of items to be checked, but the way it'd structured in the manual review process is that the code showing that the item is no longer being sold (and therefore doesn't need to be checked) doesn't come up for about 2 hours into the review process. By removing them at the beginning, it prevents those hours of work. I don't know why the process can't be changed to put that at the front, but hey. 
Keep going. When you find the bug you'll slap yourself and think "how silly I is". That's the most productive education in programming you'll ever receive.
Thanks @erijml for a great post!
Whenever I code, words start looking surreal to me and I question whether they've always looked like that and if I'm spelling them right. Kind of like when you stare at your own face in the mirror under a candle light, eventually you stop looking human and have no more sense of self. Same with common words in code. Maybe this is what it feels like to integrate with The Machine. 
Yeah, I know. I'm still looking for the solution, and actually I think I might have it here now. I just started a couple days ago, and I learn best by stumbling around in the dark and getting mad, lol
Good points! I have thought about and indeed used libraries like that before. I don't _mind_ them and in some cases even liked them, but I do find that they can be overly clever at times. One then has to answer questions like "What about dynamic path parts?" and "Query parameters are the kwargs, where do the headers and cookies go?" We just wanted something that lightly wrapped `requests` (which we already use) that put structure around what we were trying to do :) Thanks for the input!
I feel like I'm starting to sort of pick up on the flow of it a bit. It's like being able to identify when somebody apologizes or asks where the library is in Spanish.
That reminds me of one of my favorite bits from *Endgame* &gt; Hamm: What's he doing? &gt; (CLOV raises lid of NAGG's bin, stoops, looks into it. Pause.) &gt; Clov: He's crying. &gt; (He closes lid, straightens up) &gt; Hamm: Then he's living.
That's a good point! I think in an earlier iteration we hadn't inverted control of most things yet, and after fixing that it didn't get pointed out before it made its way into the wild. There's potential for that to make it into a future release for sure!
:'-) *clap* *clap*
Is there a Pipeline module available? Or is it just jargon to describe the work flow? 
Let me ask you this, can I: f=open("IDs.txt", "r") contents=f.read() if comment.id in IDs.txt: blah blah blah
The issue was resolved https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12062
The bug has been present in NumPy for a while, it was revealed by a change between Python 3.6-3.7. So your only choice is to use an older Python until it's released
Yes - but until it's released and you upgrade your NumPy you should avoid using 3.7
numpy pandas matplot sklearn requests sqlite3 django
To quote the pull request: &gt; The problem was OBJECT_to_* did not quit on error, and the error was cleared by subsequent calls (in PyArray|_IsScalar in CDOUBLE\_setitem, it seems). Probably in python3.7 they must have added a call to PyErr\_Clear somewhere, which exposed this bug. This doesn't mean that numpy was bugged before this, it means that Python changed behavior, and numpy wasn't aware of said change.
Definitely agreed! I just don’t imagine that they’ll take too long to release a bug patch version of the current numpy release.
If comment.id is a bytes sequence, yeah.
Have you tried [reading the documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/routines.fft.html)?

I interpreted that statement which says "exposed this bug" to mean that this is a bug that was present in NumPy before the "PyErr\_Clear" was added in python 3.7. &amp;#x200B; But in addition, I interpret that code as a bug - why should that function continue after erroring out?
What I'm telling you though, is that it has been helpful for me.
I've built multiple bots that handle documents at work. Mainly they upload documents to orders within our fulfillment platform (platform doesn't have a bulk option). Some download specific documents from client platforms and upload them to ours (their integrations are weak). These bots save roughly 20 mins/order and have processed well over 30,000 orders. Really helps when a product has tight margins and we need to maximize operation time. I also build forms in our platform and have built a github-esque django platform to track changes/requests, view the code in browser and test the forms for common issues or mistakes. This saves me a serious amount of time by keeping all the forms in a neat, albeit ugly, UI where I can view older versions to track down issues, quickly rollback changes and stay on top of pending projects. The form testing is a great tool as well, it was once just a command line script I'd run, a lot easier now that it's in the UI.
Numpy works with *numeric* types, not binary or hex, but ints and floats. You'll need to know how that data is formatted so that you can decode it into an array of numerical values. 
Here is the source code to what was presented: import PySimpleGUI as sg import psutil layout = [ [sg.Text('CPU Utilization')] , [sg.Text('', size=(8,2), font='Helvetica 20', justification='center', key='_text_')], [sg.Exit()]] window = sg.Window('CPU Meter').Layout(layout) while True: button, values = window.ReadNonBlocking() if button == 'Exit' or values is None: break cpu_percent = psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1) window.FindElement('_text_').Update(f'CPU {cpu_percent:02.0f}%') &amp;#x200B;

You mention a library that's marginally slower than yours but has bugs-- can you show some examples in test cases?

In animation production, files can be numerous and huge. 
I am exploring building gui user forms for work, and then import that data into our DB. Using this method can I make it so other employees can access these forms without putting them on a web app?
Don't forget that PyQt5 itself has a bunch of examples in its documentation, ported from the C++ version. There's also an app that lets you browse through all those examples, though last time I tried it it didn't load the documentation part properly, and I couldn't figure out how to fix it. Maybe broken in the port?

I just started self teaching python a month ago. My biggest hurdles have been : Those things with a def operation (objects?)

Yeah, its good to see the instant feedback of your work. Also makes it easier for newcomer to learn the work process and all. I wrote documentation for each of those and felt really good :)
Did you set it to a random time.sleep so it's not the exact same every time? Or does she know it's automated?

Has someone re-written them to be Pythonic? Last time I messed with Qt it felt very much like a C++ wrapper.
Learned python so that I could build a script that scrapes a set of really poorly designed web reports and outputs the relevant data as a csv. Supposedly I took a 2 day job and turned it into 2 minutes.
I'm really impressed with the Mu editor. I recommend it for beginners and teachers over IDLE. It has a rich set of new features but still retains the simplicity of IDLE. Definitely recommend downloading it: https://codewith.mu/
If you mean the `QString` thing, that has been fixed for years.
I’d be interested if you do. Sounds awesome!
lol! more like possums around here!
I’d be happy to! I just need to get the non-personal stuff in PyPI and it’s own GitHub repo. I’ll work on that this week!
Very interesting project. Didn't know. Thank you for posting!

Looks really nice thanks.
Is there a better pdf module? I really didn't take a lot of time to search.
Yesss!! Thank you!
I always hated nonsensical examples that have no real world usage like foo/bar/baz and Animal/Cat/Dog, Car/Truck/Sedan. Putting something in the context of real world usage made things so much easier to comprehend.
What do those @ signs in the C code do?
&gt; By the way, if that code looks strange to you - it's because NumPy uses it's own template engine. Ahh missed that the first time through. Makes sense.
Depends. I've been working a lot with PDFs lately and I've found a lot of them are outdated. Depending on if you can get them working and/or what you need to do, you could check out Pdfminer or pdftk (which has some decent standalone variants). There's some modules sit on top of these, but they all appear to use these plus tesseract. 
It's pointer to variable x
Not being provided to complete real world coding exercises. Also taught useless concepts like foobar. Maybe it's just me, but I prefer hands on learning and I learn best through trial and error during programming. 
It expands out x as a series of positional arguments. For example, if x is (1,2,3), then print(*x, sep=" ") is equivalent to print(1, 2, 3, sep=" ") https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#unpacking-argument-lists
It unpacks the iterable x and passes the items as positional arguments. The fourth usage of an * as described in this article https://medium.com/understand-the-python/understanding-the-asterisk-of-python-8b9daaa4a558
No pointer in python

Out of curiosity, what benefits does using Click provide over something like argparse?
Yes. Qt's Model-View framework is absolutely amazing. Tho, more complex applications require a fair bit of dabbling and subclassing.
This sub is for python news and packages, rather than solving problems (post in r/learnpython instead) In a nut shell, don't create subprocess if you can call the function itself)
Wait, even in Java?!
It’s way more human parseable. Makes more sense than sitting trying to count the 0s. TypeScript also has this feature.
Thanks, I've just started learning PyQt5 for a personal project and this looks like a good tutorial.
Absolutely amazing book, I highly recommend this for all beginners or anyone who wants to do a bit of revision on python.
Thank you for asking the question
You get everything, I did one of these for 20 dollars and got a bunch of books on Python. Was worth it.
Yeah same, using words as foo just annoys me.

Wrote a script that goes to some website that hosts Berserk, a manga series. It’s basically a webcrawler that scrolls through the pages and compiles them neatly in a PDF file. No time saved, but I was able to read it without having scary pop-up ads. Stole half from stackoverflow and half from the package manuals. 
I don't remember exactly now. I wanted to remind me and I see it's pointless as validictory is deprecated now: [https://pypi.org/project/validictory/](https://pypi.org/project/validictory/) \&gt; :warning: As of 2018 this library is deprecated, please consider using jsonschema instead.
I don't have it anywhere public right now and think it'd need cleaning up a little to be worth sharing, but I'll look into getting it on github soon.
FYI, users will get a message when you mention them like this: `/u/&lt;username&gt;`.
Neat, I wrote my own until functions for most of those, but this is better. 
I'm self employed nowadays, so I wrote a Python script that takes my calendar as input and creates invoices for the work I have done from the calendar. This is awesome, because when I work, I just open my calendar, write "x y text" into a line, with x being the number of hours and y a code for a company. Then at the end of the day, if I have not worked exactly 8 hours, I write "#TOTAL x" with x being the number of hours. I save the calendar in ICAL format, and the script first tells me, if the hours on any day don't match. I then fix the days that don't, export the calendar again and now it creates JSON for what's to invoice. This JSON is then converted to a pdf invoice. I briefly look at them, if there's text I don't like, I change it in the JSON and run the job again. The job also saves the json inside the pdf, so I can later have another job running through a folder of invoices and extract the info for taxes, checking, etc. This took me 2-3 days to write, but the time savings are great, because now my invoices are always consistent and quickly created. 
I am not happy about having numpy as dependency for such a simple script, why is numpy needed? Also, requests is listed in requirements.txt, but I see no references to it in the script.
Any benefit for the _user of the cli_, assuming they're not reading or modifying it? (Handling of arguments from variables is better.)
In lieu of my non existent code, here are two tools that can do the scraping: [pdftotext (Linux\_Tool)](https://linux.die.net/man/1/pdftotext), [textract (Python Implementation)](https://github.com/deanmalmgren/textract), and instructions for how to do it yourself with, [Python Stanford pdfminer Tutorial](https://stanford.edu/~mgorkove/cgi-bin/rpython_tutorials/Using%20Python%20to%20Convert%20PDFs%20to%20Text%20Files.php). If I were to implement it now, I'd probably use docker. Here's a helpful resource: [fullstackpython.com/Docker](https://www.fullstackpython.com/docker.html).
If you need your full control over managing these processes I would recommend using a proper task queue. Saves you a lot of hassle and ultimately, it is a solved problem which means you don't have to reinvent the wheel. Personally I would use Celery because it's mature and has a big community and it's what I'm most familiar with but I guess something like RQ is equally fit for purpose.
It's still largely unpythonic imo. camelCase and setters/getters are probably the worst offenders, or at least most frequently encountered ones. You can use native python types, e.g. int or str where applicable now, so that's nice.
Oh. Thanks
Hi, I'm currently using connexion in my stack, and I'm trying to understand how to connect it with a postgresql database using flask. I feel like my google-fu is not as good as I haven't found any direct example about this case and trying to understand how to apply the standard sqlalchemy flask tutorial to try to connect the database. Would you be able to help clarify my understanding? &amp;#x200B;
I think I've now resolved this - by allowing TUIs to interrupt the standard refresh delay when new input is available. I honestly can't sense any delay now, but would appreciate it if you could have a look too. Does the latest contact\_list demo (and package) on master (available from [https://github.com/peterbrittain/asciimatics](https://github.com/peterbrittain/asciimatics)) solve your timing concerns?
Python3 uses bytes where Python2 wants strings. You *probably* want to patch line 310 in test.py to read; crsr.executemany(bytes(sql, 'UTF-8'), data)
I tried this solution, unfortunately it failed. &amp;#x200B; I received this error: &amp;#x200B; crsr.executemany(bytes(sql, 'UTF-8'), data) TypeError: The first argument to execute must be a string or unicode query.
I feel like this program is especially made for you!
Oh, then maybe the original error is complaining about `data` not being bytes? That's a little more of a nuisance. From the docs, it looks like `data` is in the following shape; data = [[row1a, row1b, ..], [row2a, row2b, ....], ...] If so, you can write a little wrapper function like def encode_data(data): for row in data: yield [bytes(el, 'UTF-8') if isinstance(el, str) else el for el in row] And then patch line 310 with csrs.executemany(sql, encode_data(data)) I've never used pyodbc though, so I'm not really 100% on the shape.
Do you have any idea why this error is coming up? I have uploaded this excel file to SQL many times without any errors however now there is new data on the file there is this error..
Chances are, all your data up until now has been ASCII (basically, US/English letters/numbers and some symbols), and your new data steps outside of that (maybe accented European letters, or an asian name, or a smiley, etc). The nice thing about ASCII is that almost every other encoding builds off of it, so Python doesn't need to worry about how to encode it - since it all squashes down to the same thing. But if when you go outside of ASCII, you have a whole bunch of competing standards\* (UTF-8, UTF-7, UTF-16, Latin-1, etc), and Python doesn't really know which one to use, so it throws an error. ___ \* UTF-8 won the encoding war, but we're still waiting for the other standards to die off.
Celery is a great tool but everything does not have to be done with celery. If op just needs multiple instances of [recognition.py](https://recognition.py) runing then a simple use case of multiprocessing \[ [https://pymotw.com/3/multiprocessing/](https://pymotw.com/3/multiprocessing/) , [https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html](https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html) \] would suffice. IMHO, unless I really need Celery, i would code out my parallelism using multiprocessing or asyncio or even threads rather than going celery and requiring an extra service like redis or rabbitmq as an added requirements to deploying my code.
I'm doing some beginner-level training at work and look forward to using Mu instead of IDLE (which I started with, and had the usual pains with). I am working through a couple of your books with them :)
I agree about keeping it as simple as possible. However, I think ensuring that those processes run in a reliable and robust way (op: "If let say one of the processes died, how do I check and bring it back up?") sounds like a perfect job for a task scheduler. As a side note, you don't need an extra service like redis or rabbitmq, you can use the filesystem as a broker.
I don't have anything to suggest to you but perhaps I can chime in and let you know that you can search github with a query like: "is:issue is:open label:"beginner" language:python" gives you all issues that have been labled beginner and are in python.

Working on a tool to organize my audiobooks with a database to get more information about the book before listening to it. Integrated iTunes search-api to get the metadata (is the only online DB I could find that suits my needs) Still working on book collection, because they are not provided by iTunes. Tried Goodreads but it is a pain. I like to have an inbox folder where I drop the audiobook and it gets sorted in the correct folder (author -&gt; collection -&gt; book) but that will take some time
HTML, YAML, markdown. Sometimes a combination (e.g. markdown in YAML).
That's the best answer I could get on this post. Thank you! 
It just looks a little easier to set up for quick scripts. Environment variables are just a bit more work to set up each time. And compared to argparse, the syntax looks a little easier to remember. That said, argparse is built in, so it’s got that advantage. 
There are generally two parts to getting random numbers: finding an unpredictable value for an initial state for a sequence, and stepping along the sequence to generate more numbers in an unpredictable pattern. The article is mostly about the first step, gathering a sufficient input that will create an unpredictable seed (or series of seeds). This is sometimes called measuring entropy. And unfortunately, the quality of this approach varies greatly on the actual hardware and environment you use: ensuring that the signal to the microphone is within the ideal band, ensuring that the signal converters have no hidden biases, and ensuring that the environment actually has a diverse set of input sounds without significant biases. A microphone at -10dB listening to your air conditioner on a 60Hz circuit is no good, and putting it out on the street is really only good at certain hours of the day when streets are busy and not sleepy. Your question is more about the second step-- the actual output of the PRNG as a sequence of numbers, and whether they are predictable or not. Once you have an initial value that was generated from sufficient entropy sources, you can generate many more unpredictable values in a hard-to-predict sequence without further seed values. Many different PRNGs exist, and their sequences can be studied at length to look for biases in their distribution, or patterns in their output. They all depend on a truly unpredictable seed for the first value in the sequence, if you want to generate something like a cryptographic one-time pad. High quality systems actually try to draw from many sources of entropy at once, and they calculate or estimate the value of the entropy. They will update their PRNGs with new seed values only sparingly, when the total entropy gathered is sufficient, and rely on the chain sequence for most of the time. On a personal computer, observing human mouse and keyboard interactions are a source of entropy, but only when in use. On a server, those inputs would be useless but background chatter or collision rates on the ethernet backbone may be of use at some times. For cryptographers, relying on only one or two sources becomes an attack vector for determined eavesdroppers. 
Here is an example of how one would go about calling a worker function with different arguments. Of course you would need to rewrite [recognition.py](https://recognition.py) in your case such that the worker function recieves the different parameters your [recognition.py](https://recognition.py) code needs. &amp;#x200B; import multiprocessing from time import sleep from random import random import sys &amp;#x200B; def worker(arg\_1, arg2): """ A function that is run in its own process space by multiprocessing. """ \#Simulate us running some tasks and then exiting randomly \#We do the simulation by getting random numbers from 1 to 10 \#and if we get a 1 exit with an exception and if 2 exit normally while True: random\_number = int(random()\*10) print(random\_number) if random\_number == 1: raise Exception("Simulate Processing exiting with an Exception") elif random\_number == 2: \#simulate normal exit print("{} is exiting normally.".format(multiprocessing.current\_process().name)) sys.exit(0) else: \#Keep running, just sleep for 1 second. sleep(1) if \_\_name\_\_ == "\_\_main\_\_": \#For simplicity we use 2 processes. But one could create many processes \#by using a for loop. tasks\_data = { "my\_worker\_1": ("this is worker", "another\_param") , "my\_worker\_2": ("This is worker 2", "also another param just for example.") } tasks = {} \#Launch a worker process using values from tasks\_data to pass a name and args for name, arg in tasks\_data.items(): process = multiprocessing.Process(name=name, target=worker, args=arg) process.start() tasks.update({name: process}) print("exiting") while True: \#monitor if any of our processes die and start it again. for name, process in tasks.items(): if not process.is\_alive(): print("{} has exited or died, respawning it".format([process.name](https://process.name))) \#Since we know the name of the process that exited, we can \#get the args from tasks\_data args = tasks\_data.get([process.name](https://process.name)) p = multiprocessing.Process([name=process.name](https://name=process.name), target=worker, args=args) p.start() tasks.update({name:p}) sleep(1) 
Thanks! Can you say more about why moving the tests is helpful? Happy to think about that if I can understand it better! Since the tests are fairly small currently I doubt we'll introduce another dependency just yet, but if they're getting bigger over time maybe we'll think about pytest.

Fuck off cunt
If anything, many of the things that are terrible about Python are C heritage...
I'll just figure it out on my own. He's a piece of shit cunt. 
Because it's not java.
What do you mean by saying it's terrible?
If I'm not mistaken, C and Python were made to be completely different. Python is a high level language that uses less functions to do broader tasks. C is a low level language, this means that C is able to get very specific and do tedious tasks with the actual computer files and software. So expecting it to be like C is the wrong idea. 
I would have helped you, but not now that I see this comment.
If you're calling a person who linked you valuable information is a "piece of shit cunt", it's probably you.

For testing randomness, there are two suites of algorithms that are generally considered standard tests, these being National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) PRNG test suite and the Dieharder randomness test suite. NIST: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/legacy/sp/nistspecialpublication800-22r1a.pdf Dieharder: https://webhome.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/General/dieharder.php
Thanks! If you have a few minutes, could you run one of these tests on the output of this algorithm? (I'll do it too, but worth testing on different computers).
I'm still not sure I get it...the project indeed has a tests folder. Are you talking about where the tests end up after install?
it's to make faster for people who want to run the test finds the test folder faster since it's in the root folder of your master repo, as well as making test suite separate from the module itself
Ah I see, that made it click for me haha. That's a great point! Will see what we can do about that 👍🏼
I quickly looked at `dieharder`, would you have a TL;DR about how to apply the test on a binary file of x MB of random data? dieharder ?? -input-file random.data Also would anyone have a Windows binary for it?
I think I've got to use Django for the next one, if they don't ever stop making me do crud apps. 
This is really nice, had to bookmark and save! thanks
The article links provided in this article is also written by me to Cover sub topic in detail. If I wrote all in a single article. This article will become too long around 10,000 to 15,000 words
Take a look at Airflow
I can only imagine the baby rage you'll throw while reading the documentation since that's full of links to documentation.
Those are fair mitigations for the audio, and I can say I was being harsh on purpose as a skeptic in general, not trying to dismiss this work in particular. However, many such systems are employed unmanned for months at a time, and a nurse must be set up to ensure the noise levels continue to be within their design limits. If a mic condenser membrane rips and nobody notices, will 99% silence still feed enough quality entropy? Maybe... but it should be explicitly set out.
Yes you're totally right about the manned/unmanned aspect. Also criticism/skepticism is of course useful, and even required in those domains!
Yes random module use current system time as a default seed value if not provided
Not everything can run asynchronously, you still need some operations to run synchronously.

Hello! I'm a bot! It looks to me like your post might be better suited for r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. That said, I am a bot and it is hard to tell. I highly recommend posting your question there. Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster. Show /r/learnpython the code you have tried and describe where you are stuck. **[Be sure to format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F)** and include which version of python and what OS you are using. *** ^(this bot is written and managed by /u/IAmKindOfCreative) ^(This bot is currently under development and experiencing changes to improve its usefulness)
I'll take a stab.. dict = {} for i in range(1000): dict[i] = [0,0]
Shameless plug for those interested, you can compare dictlib with [Scalpl](https://github.com/ducdetronquito/scalpl) which let you use every [dict methods](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict) with composite keys :) I found it more powerful and expressive, but I am biaised (i develop/maintain it)
Google Text to Speech. There's nothing self-hosted that matches the quality right now.
I don't need your stupid help. 
using it rn. Wanted to explore other, possibly better options. i guess I will stick to it for now.
Also Handy for random data https://factoryboy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ https://pypi.org/project/Faker/
What's the advantage of using enaml compared to loading the .ui file directly?
Detailed and almost covers most of the topics. Can you to create a new article which will cover remaining functions of numpy.random
`dict[i] = [0, 0]` is what you want. 
Finally finished my biggest project so far. https://github.com/PhantomInsights/mexican-jobs It is a comprehensive data analysis of job offers from Mexico. It contains a web scraper, reddit bots, data miner and functions to generate plots and insights. It used: * Requests * BeautifulSoup * lxml * pandas * matplotlib * seaborn * geopandas All the code is fully commented and explained.
Like to see how these functions can be bound together for improved random key generation. While the nature is always pseudo random, the entropy should elude OS fingerprinting.
FYI, peewee is a great library that includes a [dataset clone](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#dataset) among other useful interfaces. 
My boss always jokes that m6 scripts are automating everyone's jobs away (that's deep down our real goal). I have a co-worker "B". He left for vacation for about a week. I took his laptop and wrote a script that on startup, opens a console and logs strings. &gt;B replacement protocol activated &gt;on Date() &gt;B has been replaced Repeat above line every 2 seconds endlessly
You are absolutely right about the requests module, i have put it in requirements.txt because i was willing to add a function to the script that takes an image url and then make a request and convert the image to ASCII art, but now i've fixed that and removed it. I used numpy to convert the image to a numpy array so i can manipulate the pixels in it.
Basically because "explicit is better than implicit". I agree that integrating an async mechanism like gevent into the core language would be easier to use and read, but there are some advantages to separating it as well, such as making the event loop implementation replaceable, and making it obvious where the code will block and where it'll give the control back to the event loop. 
Yeah, no shit you're struggling - you want us to do your homework and you can't even post the whole problem. 
It is mentioned in official documentation
I actually prefer mimesis to faker. It feels faster, can be seeded (for reproducibility), and has a lot of internationalization options for names, addresses, etc. Faker isn't bad though! 
Who ares about dropbox anyways? Free accounts only get a stingy 5GB of space. I get infintie storage google drive for free
&gt; b = [1,2,4,5,6,7,5,4,3,4,5,5] &gt; for x in b: print(*x, sep=" ") ... Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; TypeError: print() argument after * must be an iterable, not int &gt; b = [[1,2],[4,5,6,7],[5,4,3,4,5,5]] &gt; for x in b: print(*x, sep=" ") ... 1 2 4 5 6 7 5 4 3 4 5 5 &gt;&gt;&gt; 
I used `Dataset` for a little music download and tagging system, I am not sure I would recommend it for anything of any real complexity though. That being said, &gt;What I fear most about SQLAlchemy, though, is adding column, and altering column properties... (via Alembic? I hate that.) You can do this in `Dataset` pretty easily. It supports column creation and dropping, including [dynamic column creation](https://dataset.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#dataset.Table.insert). I'd look at `peewee` like /u/AndydeCleyre said, it gives you more without really being any more complex than `Dataset` (and /u/coleifer knows his shit). 
You can, its called functional programming. The challenge is then interfacing with the imperative world. Consider the following bit of code: os.remove("somefile") with open("somefile", "w") as fout: fout.print("testing") os.rename("somefile", "anotherfile") How would that work in an async context? Can `os.remove` return a future? Obviously not. I agree that it would be nice if functions that were side-effect free could be run asynchronously, but even that is a bit messy with python. Suppose I attach a decorator that logs function calls to stdout? The underlying function might be side-effect free and should return a future, but the decorator isn't. So do we break async code by merely decorating it with logging?
Thank you! I'll check them out. 
Without a proper compsci education, the only real way this can happen is through consulting, which will probably be near impossible for a 17 year old. Any company looking to hire a consultant is leaning on their alleged expertise. At 17, even if you started very young, you don't have enough. &amp;#x200B; You basically need to prove your self-taught skills to a company willing to take a chance on you after proving you can walk the walk, or get a college/uni degree in computer science and follow that route into the workforce. &amp;#x200B; There is no replacement for experience, even with the education, and you cannot walk into any more than an entry level position even with a degree. There will be and are exceptions of course, but generally speaking, that's how you'd do it.
Your seed is a. If a is not provided then the system time is used as a seed. You can use some other process to randomly generated a before providing it.
I bought 2 python textbooks then solved all the problems.
I will be working on an alpha version of a Python3 API for Wallaroo, our scale independent distributed real time processing system. The project was started with a 3rd party contribution by @caj-larsson (thanks!) a couple of months ago, but we were in the middle of another big project and couldn't lend as much assistance as we would have liked. Now that one big project is out of the way, we're going to spend some time on getting this up and working.
ok retard. no
If you don't mind me asking, how many years did it take to get to this level of programming skill?
It's still technically possible to use the decorator and yield from syntax in async Python. Which limits the need for async and non-async functions, though this syntax will be deprecated in 3.8 or 3.9, I believe. The fundamental reason is that async functions in Python can only run the context of an event loop. The async definition is essentially requiring that the function runs within in the context of an event loop. It's all due to how asyncio is implemented in Python. 
Somewhat unrelated but I use this frequently for cisco firepower management! https://github.com/daxm/fmcapi
The thing is my brother is kinda addicted to the game "Paladins" , even when i say him not to play so much , he still plays it hiding from me , or when i am not near him . So i wrote a script in python that takes the processes running in my pc and if my brother starts the game, i get a notification that paladins is running now (or any other thing which i don't want him to start in a given time) , so now i always catch my bro when he starts it and i even tell him the exact time he started it and how much time he played it and he always looks to me in a shocking face xD 
Where are you based? You could always try doing some work on upwork, but I would recommend doing some work on some of the more popular open source projects that are related to the area of programming that you want to go into. After that you can approach companies that are using those technologies.
Awesome, sorry for the dumb question but, say I build a use form and I want someone in another dept. to use it, how do they acces the form?
Every user must have python installed (preferably the same version) and the libs. One of the downsides of python is that in certain environments it's not that plug-and-play to distribute.
That would defeat the purpose of the exercise, which is learning to write lexers in python.
Or you can make a simple web form, it all depends on how big/complex the form is.
I would like to see that, do you have the code anywhere?
Do you have your code for this anywhere?
Thank you so much

Now, it comes down to SQLAlchemy vs. Peewee. Peewee is quite cool in "backref". I think it is even more preferable than SQLAlchemy is this sense.
Ding ding. That's exactly what it was. I started messing around with Qt5 2 years ago and shelved it because I never ended up using it.
That's amazing, thanks for the insight. 
Watched part of your video and disagreed with most everything I watched. Many production houses require the ability to revert changes. Alembic allows this. Alembic tool chain also allows for test migrations throughout your workflow deployment chains while protecting demands of configuration management and deployment management. Likewise, for non-trivial, non-inhouse only apps, the ability to upgrade from any given version to the current version is amazingly important. Especially if it can be granted without downtime (and especially dump/load). Once again, should problems be exposed, the ability to revert is equally significant. Hence, in part, the rise of dev-ops. You speak of slowing down development, but I've found this to be the exact opposite. Generally, not part of the development cycle until time for merges and/or releases. Being able to share your Alembic code with other developers so that they can be brought in sync to your code/database is very important. Especially for those who are working on forks outside of the current release cycle. I might suggest that your position may suite your individual needs but fall short of a generic solution. Which is, after all, what Alembic offers. As you may have discovered, genetic solutions are just that - generic. Good for a majority of people not necessarily a good solution for everyone. One size fits all rarely does. I will also add that schema diffs are an important validation step for migrations. As such, I see your diff tool as a compliment and in no way competition with Alembic. 
I recently start learning PySide2, looking at this PyQt5 it looks like fairly similar. Functionality wise, what makes this two modules different from each other?
Either is better than nothing.
Ah sorry, I think i misread your question. With numpy, you can do this: test3
Your best bet is to build a personal portfolio, and contribute to open source projects. It doesn't matter what you build, just don't stop building. Show you can build and deploy by making a shitty personal page with a basic custom CMS and throwing it up on Azure or AWS. Once you have some portfolio work, sign up with a consulting/contracting firm to get some experience, then if the placement company enjoys your work they will usually make a good offer to come on full time. The other advice I would give is find a domain, and specialize in that. By domain, I mean an industrial sector. Developing in the real world is less about syntax and more about knowing your customers' needs and delivering products that improve their work. 
Numpy has a much more \[comprehensive suite\]([https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.random.html](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.random.html)) of random number generators, especially if you want a particular distribution, such as Weibull. If you're looking for an almost complete list of random distributions for stats, fitting, sampling, \[scipy.stats\]([https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/stats.html](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/stats.html)) is even better.

You're still missing Skaarj's point. As you say, if you CALL `random.seed()` without an `a` argument, or with `a=None`, then the system time is used as a seed. If you do not call `random.seed()` at all, then it becomes very important to understand what the system will use as a seed. If it takes the system time at first call to `random.random()`, this needs to be documented; if it takes the system time at process start, this is also important information. For non-interactive systems like servers, the system time is NOT a good random seed; the whole system may reboot and give the same seed it got last time the system was rebooted. And to Skaarj, it's a good idea to be explicit about your seeding, anyway. You should understand and be satisfied with the entropy source you're using.
You could generate Graphviz dot files and convert them to SVG graphics.
What really started me from scratch is this tutorial from zetcode: zetcode.com/gui/pyqt5/
&gt; Many production houses require the ability to revert changes. Alembic allows this. Alembic "allows" this no more or less than any other approach. In every Alembic codebase I've seen, people don't bother with reversions. They often aren't possible anyway. The most important thing with reversions is to test your migrations so that you don't need to do reversions. But a diff tool is actually a really great thing for reversions, as you can generate one mostly-automatically by doing the reverse diff. &gt; Alembic tool chain also allows for test migrations throughout your workflow deployment chains while protecting demands of configuration management and deployment management. I've no idea what this means. I use configuration management and automated deployment without Alembic and everything seems to work fine. &gt; You speak of slowing down development, but I've found this to be the exact opposite. You find creating a change file for every single change, easier than typing one command to automatically sync? &gt; Generally, not part of the development cycle until time for merges and/or releases. Really? I find that when I'm developing new features, database changes are often involved. &gt; Being able to share your Alembic code with other developers so that they can be brought in sync to your code/database is very important. I check all my database code in and share it with other devs and it seems to work fine. In fact, the fact that they can automatically sync up the database from any state at all without worrying about version numbers makes this a lot easier.
Maybe [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/network-graphs/)?
`os.urandom` is good for cryptographically secure random numbers as well as in the standard library. Really easy if you're fine with just some bytes, but easy enough to use `struct.unpack` with it as well. Though I'd say you might want to use /dev/random if you're generating a GPG key.
Here's a code to randomize the `node` (MAC Address) segment of a UUIDv1. This is useful for when you want monotonically increasing UUID (for example, as database primary/index keys), but want 6 bytes of randomness: from uuid import uuid1 as _uuid1 from random import SystemRandom def uuid1(): c = SystemRandom() return _uuid1((c.randrange(0, 1&lt;&lt;48L) | 0x010000000000L), c.randrange(1&lt;&lt;14L)) 
Certainly. Deployment can be a bit of a pain, but Python can handle games with low performance requirements. Check out pygame or pyglet.
cool! is any javascript output valid? is there renderer support for (vegalite)[https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/]/altair yet? Leaflet?

I did an isometric style game before. My biggest problem was the time it took to load things into memory between levels, especially for bigger levels. If you like python, you could try [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), which uses a language with somewhat similar syntax to python.
I compile Arm wheels for every package on PyPI, which has saved Raspberry Pi users 25 years of build time in 10 months: www.piwheels.org
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UnvMe1Neok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UnvMe1Neok) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzJrqBhTpvs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzJrqBhTpvs) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaSFO028JEo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaSFO028JEo) All written in Python &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Can you elaborate on how it breaks? I evangelize it pretty heavily, so just curious.
What sparked your interest in building this project? 
Godot now supports Python as well.
If you just want to make a simple game for fun, tools like PyGame make that totally possible. You might want to check out /r/Godot too. Python isn't a good language if you want to *focus* on game development though. Best options for that would be C# or C++. 
It’s really vague. What tools are you going to/trying to use? What data sources you have? What do you mean by `in text`? csv file? You need to be more precise on what you are asking the community.
My bad, thanks. Let me clarify - the top row and left column would be my X and Y, I have a formula to fill in the X and Y I'm the middle
Promises to teach you how to generate samples from distributions but mentions only the triangular distribution, and the uniform distribution. For anyone interested, the way to do it is to call rvs() on any one of the scipy distributions. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html Even better you can build a model in pymc3 which has many distributions dependent on each other (for example, what if the mean of your gaussian distribution was itself drawn from an exponential distribution?). These are sampled very fast with modern samplers like the NUTS no U-turn sampler.

Because no one learned any lessons from cooperative multitasking in the 90s, so we’re repeating it. 
That's like asking which car you should learn to drive in.. which car you use doesn't matter anywhere near as much as just learning to drive in the first place. Both are great languages/platforms. Pick whichever appeals to you the most for your own personal reasons, then when you're familiar with it, learn the other. People put far too much stock in learning specific languages, when really most languages have the vast majority of their concepts in common. If you're doing something specific in them, then that's potentially a different story, but for general scripting either is fine.
P.S. Shameless plug of my YouTube video that shows an example of what I'm doing: https://youtu.be/m-QPjO-2IkA
If you've used a Jupyter Notebook, it's the same thing, just the next evolution. Very easy to use, much more flexibility for large groups. There was an ACM talk a few weeks back by one of the project founders, was very interesting to understand where they are going with it.
What are you trying to learn? If its web development then java is probably better but if you’re wanting to do scientific computing or device interfacing, the. C/C++ or python are probably a better choice. A rule of thumb that is often accurate is that a compiled language will be faster than an interpreted language. 
If they do that, version control gets much tougher.
Never used jupyterlab but I use jupyter notebooks like gilxa1126 mentioned. JupyterLab is notebooks on steroids with more features and more similar to a real IDE (sort of like pycharm) then jupyter notebooks. I use notebooks because I share the notebooks with others and most people I know have notebook rather than lab.
JavaScript is generally faster than python; just because it's been so heavily optimized for use on the web. I find that python is easy to just get up and going, there's no need for fancy build chains, has a ton of great libraries and the development philosophy is better (imo). The python way is that there should be one obvious way to do anything whereas javascript's is everything that can be built with js will eventually be built with js. I think the biggest argument for python is development speed and developer happiness; it's intuitive and nice to work with. (especially for smaller programs). 
It sounds like you just want a CSV. Something like... #!/usr/bin/env python3 import csv x_vals = [1,2,3,4,5] y_vals = [2,4,6,8,10] magic = lambda x,y:x**y with open("file","w+") as fh: writer = csv.writer(fh, delimiter=',', quotechar='"', quoting=csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL) writer.writerow([" "] + x_vals) for y in y_vals: writer.writerow([y] + list(map(magic,x_vals,[y]*len(x_vals)))) I think what everything does is evident, except for maybe the options to the csv writer which you can read about [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html)
I use Jupyter lab combined with VSCode. I highly recommend both. Jupyter Lab is my go-to when I need to see some data outputs quickly as easily as possible. VSCode is perfect at everything else.
&gt;This is what pushed me towards Vue also. It allowed me to learn front-end programming paradigms while also building something that actually works. Same.

Additive changes typically aren’t breaking and so you should prefer to make your changes additive where possible. You can also version your API. Two common methods are to either include the version in the URL so that your API would be /v1/stuff and /v2/stuff or to include the version as a header. I prefer using a header rather than changing the URL but there are pros and cons of both. How you implement the version differences is up to you. You could route to different containers based on version or you could implement separate controllers for each version in your service as two popular options.
look into udemy also. you can probably stage a few classes. I assume they pay once you show you passed??
While I love Python (and there are Python game libraries), I think you'll have an easier time making a game and shipping a game with UE4.
I'm more familiar with the NIST suite, that's the one I've used for my own testing in the past. I believe they both work fairly similar in terms of the input file. If you have your data formatted to either an 8bit binary file or just a text file of bits. I haven't used either of these on Windows either sorry, but I believe there is a python implementation of the Dieharder suite. 
The problem with game development is to take as much you can take with system, python is interpreted, works like a middle man in you and system, but language like c/c++ don't But for low performance games it's always good but not for high end games 
If you were to turn this into a webapp and make $ from it, is it illegal to scrape job listings from various sites and post them to yours? (Provided you include a link to the original posting)
Seems more or less the same as Microsoft's current Jupyter extension (which is pretty meh). This seems like it's trying to reproduce the work already done by Atom's \[Hydrogen extension\]([https://atom.io/packages/hydrogen](https://atom.io/packages/hydrogen)), why not contribute there instead?
&gt; Cons. Library and version management among other things. And yet you recommend C...
I host things like this on my home server. I’m already paying for it to do other things. 
I am new to Python and just started learning it 1 week ago. I enrolled for a course offered by Univ of Michigan in Coursera named 'Python for Everybody'. Coursera has 7 days trial and then $49 per month and this combines 5 seperate courses. I completed two and just starting the third one, but I feel the course is really good and easy to understand and I will complete in 1 month. So the total cost will be $49. There are some good assignments that we have to complete to get the certification and the forum to ask questions also seems good. I also purchased 'Automate the Boring Stuff with Python Programming' in Udemy, which I am planning to start after the Michigan course. This way I believe I can get more practical knowledge.
I love Hydrogen, but I have to say that printing in within the code is sometimes annoying. I woul try this just because you can print on the side, so your code keeps visually cleaner.
This post is better suited for r/learnpython 
Whaaaaaa really?? There has to be a good reason but I'm shocked!
really you know, DSL is kind of fun, in the industry it really depends on devs, not so much on stereotyped conventions. for quotes, not all the time if you read the archive. but don't worry, i'll refurbish that article soon, adding your points. else, any nice py projects around from you?
Oh I didn't mention it, but it's paid for when I start. The only catch is they won't pay for the next one until you can show completion or good reason for dropping the previous one.
Analysis of data about more than **40,000 YouTube trending videos** using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and other Python packages. I finished yesterday. Here is the result (with code used) of the analysis as a Jupyter Notebook: [https://www.kaggle.com/ammar111/youtube-trending-videos-analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/ammar111/youtube-trending-videos-analysis)
Nice read. One point I feel like it should mention is that for generating a big amount of random numbers, numpy will be faster.
You could also version it via a request header

yes. it's basically just an alternative interface (vs the Jupyter Notebook app) to Jupyter notebooks (ie ipynb files). It has some extras but it's really not that much better or worse, more like eye-candy. 
&gt; You can do this in Dataset pretty easily. It supports column creation and dropping, including dynamic column creation. Cannot "dynamic column creation" in vanilla Peewee? At least, [migrations](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html?highlight=migrate#schema-migrations) seems much easier than Alembic.
lie about your experience. make a resume with a fake company and say you worked there for 20 years. Companies cant ask for your age when you apply legally. So as long as you have the skills you wont get found out
Currently working on a game with some classmates. I’m new to python, and I want to make it come out perfect. Not sure if I’m able to make the game as a text based rpg first and then put it in pygame or if I have to develop it all within pygame. Any advice/help?
Yep, I'm looking for the reasoning &amp; motivation behind the change.
You have an extra `)` on the end. Try this: if string2.lower() == "red": --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
Oh ok. So it's expecting more code. You need to tell it what to do if string2 is "red". 
O wow, thanks so much for the quick reply 
another question when it comes to ELSE/ELIF statements, I keep on getting an error on the elif statement &amp;#x200B; if string2.lower() == "red": total2 = 0 points2 = points2 + 1 total2 = points2 print(" You get",total2,"point!") elif(if string2.lower() == "green"): total2 = 0 points2 = points2 + 2 total2 = points2 print("You get", total2, "point!") else(if string2.lower() == "none"): total2 = 0 points2 = points2 + 0 total2 = points2 
Pycharm is a developer interface, jupyter is a science and experimental interface. Jupyter is the better opt for learning.
I don't have experience in particular with the YouTube API, but it should be very much like any API using OAuth2.0 authentication. Are you not able to store the token on your machine to be used for a future session?
There's no difference between urandom and random (besides that one blocks and one doesn't).

to get coverage stats for my unit tests, I can either run coverage.py directly against the source code files or just integrate it into pytest with a plugin I've yet to learn how to do that for browser-only JavaScript code, it's been quite a challenge (couldn't make blanket.js work and it is abandonware)
In many game engine, performance is not the requirement for scripting and game logic. Actual 3D rendering will be done in the game engine itself. Just fine game engine you like that supports using Python as scripting language.

Have you tried spyder for this. Similar setup to rstudio. Inline plots. Send individual lines or chunks of code to repl. Or my new favourite for this sort of thing is rstudio itself. (I have been using R for a lot longer than python so very familiar with rstudio) with R's reticulate package you can run a python repl in rstudio and send code easily. Plots appear (although not inline) in a separate viewer but really nice for that fast prototyping stage. I admit though not so hot if you want a large project with lots of your own packages/modules/submodules being created. But at that stage I switch to pycharm. 
Your auth code returned by the URL should include a refresh token, which you can "refresh" your access token with to use without going through the whole process again.
I thought the same notebook file can be viewed and edited with either interface.
Same here. Both are great. Have you tried connecting VS Code to Jupyter? It's okay but needs some polish I think.
Python can be pretty fast with asyncio, but it won't be as fast as C++. Either way, 100s of users isn't really that much, and should be possible in any programming language.
fsync() was not called and contents were not written to disk?
You don’t need to interact with the website via browser, logging in via requests is just fine. Could you show us the code that you’ve been using for this? About your dropdown problem: You need to find the right URL and data that’s needed to log in. To get this, open the dev tools in your browser and go to the network tab. Now log in. You’ll see that your browser made a POST request. This is the URL you want to use for logging in via requests. Go and inspect the POST data to see what was sent. If there’s no CSRF token you should be able to just copy and paste the data to a dict and send it via requests POST. Also be sure to use a `request.session` object, so that cookies are persistent and you can actually stay logged in.
Anyone know how to automate checking a website for price reduction for example a sneaker?
That's very far from covering the use cases of xml.
It's barely above, at a record high, while C++ is in a slump. Neat, but not too relevant.
It is always good practice to separate your source code and tests. For example, people how read or run tests can easily find tests in separate folder, rather than go through every folder in your package. Also, when you build artifact or distribution package there no point to keep tests in and it is easier to exclude it (example: packages=find\_packages('src', exclude=\['tests'\])). pytest is very easy tool to run tests even if you are not using pytest fixtures, utils, etc.
I have uploaded it [here](https://github.com/vietvudanh/manga-check) but not sure this is latest version, I will check when get home today.
Python shouldn't be an issue there. i/o, not programming language implementation, is the usual bottleneck of a web based application. Unless your server is going to have to process huge amounts of data for each player (for instance: thousands of database records) in a relatively short time, you should be fine.
I would actually use Go for something like this, but like stated below, you could honestly do this with any language you wanted as long as you understand the caveats of that language.
Ah good placeholder code/keyword until you actually have something is "pass". It doesn't do anything but you will avoid this errror you had. So it's: def some_function(): pass 
You've been a redditor for three years. Surely its time you learned to read the side-bar before posting? Also, [this site](http://sscce.org/) will help you ask good questions that will receive good answers. It is written for Java programmers, but the principles apply to Python as well. As posted, I can't make heads or tails of your code, which is why I down-voted your post.
Naming a lambda function defeats the purpose of a lambda, creating a new function to use with `map` often means that a generator expression could've been more suitable, and creating a list with a repetition of the same reference just so you can use it with another iterable in `map` definitely means you should go with something else, like `writer.writerow((y, *(x**y for x in x_vals)))`, which is a lot easier to read, allows you to remove the `magic` function, and also runs faster.
&gt; So even with a very predictable air-conditioning noise and a low-noise noise ADC, low-noise microphone, I don't see how you can predict the bits coming from this algorithm. Are you a professional cryptographer? Anyone can invent their own algorithm which they themselves cannot see how to predict the output. That proves nothing.
Let me see if I understand this blog post. The author says "don't invent your own algorithm for generating random data, because it will suck", and then he invents his own algorithm for generating random data, and calls it "true random data" (which is a meaningless term, and anyone using it doesn't understand randomness). Well done.
I'm pretty sure you need to `await` the async function, otherwise it will never run (just returns a future-ish object).
Yes, it's possible. But it's not really the best language for making games.
I know, but in order to await that function needs to be async aswel. 
CaaS
If you are running a sync / normal function and try to call an async one you need to create a loop, run it and wait for it. In Python 3.7 you can use asyncio.run(my_async_function()) and will do that for you. The other way around just works. Sorry if there are typos, I am on my mobile right now.
MIT's edX courses are good You first take the intro and then the second part. It is more than just basic Python programming. I suggest you learn the basics first from any free book like [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy.pdf) If you are into project based learning, should have a look at Udaicity's Nanodegree program. You can try the free versions first if you want to check out the instructor's style and quizzes.
Thanks , this question may look unrelated but as you uploaded in GitHub you must know the answer: How pip install will know to download your script from the webpage? Is there a way you put some keywords for the pip command find it ? If so , how there is not a posdible clash with another script with the same name? The search results I've got always require to add the url to the pip install. It is very cool in your case that only the name of the script is used. My apologies if this a silly question but i could not find an answer yet. Thanks. 
It is quite different, because `black` is auto-formatter and we are a linter. You can start with reading the docs: https://wemake-python-styleguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_pages/violations/index.html
I'm assuming this is an educational adventure. As such you really need to figure it out your self as this is exceedingly easy to do in a number of ways. The real trick is understanding what the instructor expects to see.
Are you painting the text to each and every frame or are you merging an overlay? I would imagine that putText is that way to be as speedy as possible. 
Checked it out, and at a first glance [it does look like a nicer option](https://mimesis.readthedocs.io/foreword.html), i like that it has no odd dependencies but the speed is a great plus. I guess i no longer will generate testing data on my own :D

Filing this away for future reference. It could've had more verbosity on the "Move it to the internet." section, though. I'm not currently at a place where I can try it out, and I don't know what to expect from zappa.
Actually it's that simple with Zappa - literally install it and a couple of CLI commands and you're done.
