Ok thx :)
Data analysis covers the simple analyses of a couple of columns of data in Excel as well. It has quite a broad definition across descriptive analyses, predictive analyses, and prescriptive analysis.
I disagree. Why all lovers of this argument so focused on this particular type of mistake? You can already make tons of other mistakes with same consequences. If you want the language to babysit you so much, go back to strongly typed languages with a compiler. Plus, it's actually possible to confuse a walrus for == in longer logical expressions in brackets.
I would recommend learning the socket module. There are plenty of examples that make a simple server and client.
I think they're both kind of awesome in their own way.

Python *is* a strongly-typed language.

How high frequency? If it's nanoseconds level like how HFT firms do, go C++. If it's only higher frequency than human traders, Python is fine.
&gt; You aren't able to see the forest from the trees. No, I'm saying that unless you're making something that needs to be extremely big -- say, an operating system or a web browser -- passing one million lines means something has gone wrong along the way. &gt; For Linux, how many lines of code go into actually making a bare bones distro with all the POSIX tools included and a windowing manager? The kernel is 20M lines. The portion of that that is used depends on your architecture, among other things. Adding X11 or some other windowing manager will increase by likely a few million lines. &gt; In Dropboxs case they likely have client UIs, Ok, using your 10k sloc metric, that's 30k for win/linux/osx. 3% of the way there. &gt; client based hashing and comparison tools Hashlib is [253 lines](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/hashlib.py). &gt; servers How many endpoints do you think they have? If we're being generous and say a thousand, and each one is 100 sloc to implement, that's 100,000 lines. &gt; server management tools Generously, ten thousand lines. &gt; compression libraries. zlib is [617 lines](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/4fa9591025b6a098f3d6402e5413ee6740ede6c5/Modules/clinic/zlibmodule.c.h) You keep rattling off these simple tasks as if they are enormous things that require a ton of code to implement.
Hello! I'm a bot! It looks to me like your post might be better suited for r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. That said, I am a bot and it is hard to tell.

And you keep trivializing things to try and make your case. It's more than just a lib here and a lib there. Why can you not see past that? Here's a though, apply to Dropbox or any large company and see what the code is like in a production environment. It seems you're too keen to only view these things in isolation.
Please don't start this. You know I meant compile time type safety.
Actually it is not true. Raw SQL is perfectly safe as long as you use parametrized queries. Usually ORMs are written by people who know what they are doing, but it is quite possible to have ORM with SQL injection vulnerabilities. I agree with you about avoiding ORMs, you probably should avoid it, unless you writing a single purpose app and just need a way to store data and don't want to spent time on database design. In actual companies applications change, but data stays, if you use ORMs you will have a bad time eventually. BTW, SQLAlchemy actually had two ways of using. The ORM which, well is the ORM and it builds schema based on the objects defined, and Core, where you tell the SQLAlchemy your data schema and then use Python code to build SQL queries.
I don't want to work in software. If you were reading to read and not to reply you would see that isn't my career path. I don't think the existence of a 1M sloc codebase is absurd. I think having that for what is ultimately a relatively simple thing is absurd. I also think it is remarkably stupid to suggest that the task at hand in programming the dropbox app is much more complicated than the task at hand of programming Numpy or Scipy.

Real question from someone with limited programming experience: do people use anything other than git/GitHub for version control?? If so, what do you like about this tool?
Yes--and again I'm not dumping on django by any means [django-plotly-dash](https://pypi.org/project/django-plotly-dash/). But doing a `app = dash.Dash()` lets you essentially do a one page flask application that happens to be "Dash". Most "Dash"boards I've done have either been non-interactive with interval updates or doing updates with user activity. But they have all pretty much been single page dash boards which is covered by the one page flask stuff. 
You're right. The other day my friend ask me where he can find material to learn C#, I just forwarded him the link to official tutorial site. Those material is a good starter pack for those who have no experience but we are sure want more if we want to advance with the help of other books. Thanks for reminding this:)
Thank you and I hope that you do! :)
That's actually interesting thing to know. I recently learned about SQLAlchemy, previously I always used RAW SQL. I didn't have opportunity to program with Core I was thinking that's probably the best way to do database access. The issue with using raw access for me was that for every project I had to write my own interface to interact with database, and every project I started I was copying the code so I was hoping that SQLAlchemy Core was capable to do it. I really liked freedom RAW SQL provided. For example there are many ways to insert bulk data to a database, some ways are faster others are much slower. For example in PostgreSQL the fastest is to use COPY, but that requires local access, and the data needs to be properly formatted, the second fastest method is to use `extra.execute_batch()` in conjunction with a prepared statement. You no longer have control of things like that with ORM.
If you’re just starting out, it’s a good idea to use something like Anaconda (or Homebrew for the more adventurous) - these will install a nice fresh 3.7 Python for you without risking disturbance to the 2.7 Python that your operating system is using for day to day tasks. I think the general purpose Python installer for MacOS is also pretty good at avoiding these conflicts nowadays, but Anaconda etc. are safer and more straightforward options for a beginner imo. 
Sorry for the late reply. My understanding is that gunicorn doesn't use worker threads in sync mode. The reason for this is what WSGI (the interface between gunicorn and whatever framework you're using like Flask or Django) is relatively agnostic towards if frameworks are thread safe or not. 
Hmm... I'm not sure what you mean about 2-step swap, so apologies for my ignorance, but I always thought that psycopg2 was fast because it was just interface for PostgreSQL C library, so it supposed to use the native operations. BTW if your problem was that `executemany()` is slow. That actually is correct, because on every operation it waits for database response. For bulk operations you should use [`extras.execute_batch()` or `extras.execute_values()`](http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/extras.html#fast-execution-helpers) those are dramatically faster.
`:=` should have been `?=`
For research yes, production no
Django has a lot of features but because of the extensive file organization to me it seems kinda hard, however what ends up happening is I create blueprints and my project starts to look like a Django project so ya
That's a stretch. Assembly level branching has been around forever. The `while True` version makes a lot more sense than some random operator.
Made a really simple script to help purge old \`node\_modules\` folders from my computer, since I don't need them for old projects. I can always use NPM install to get it back if I want to go back to those projects. Node modules can start bloating my project directories so I whipped this up. [https://gist.github.com/jckuhl/4ee2e29bd3d09d655ada211389acf5a1](https://gist.github.com/jckuhl/4ee2e29bd3d09d655ada211389acf5a1)
That’s exactly how we decided for Flask at work.
+1 for yapf .. easy to include in the root of your project and customize the style guide per repo
yes, agree! 🤣
Not to be confused with [Gitea](gitea.io) the self hosted git repository 
That is much better reserved for none aware operators. So ?+ means add if not none. A?.b?.c means attribute if not none, and ?= means assign if not none. 
No. Let is about scope, this is an assignment expression that returns the assigned value.
Everyone who read the original post understood what cyberjog meant even with the miss communicated phrasing... Even you **you** as clearly demonstrated by this post. You both understood exactly what was meant and why it’s wrong. Why not just be helpful up front instead of trying to divert the discussion and act poorly? “You wrote strongly typed, but you clearly meant statically.” Would have been perfectly fine. Instead you opted to be rude.
I have several of the books you mentioned and they are wonderful. They have real world examples and guides you through how to be more pythonic in your development. 
i use github for public repos, but until recently private repos cost money on github, so when I was first starting out I used bitbucket because they offer unlimited free repos. I just haven't bothered moving them over at work we use a local installation of gitlab. there are a few quirks, but mostly it is fine. merge requests are the most common source of annoyance though
Is URL patterns in that example the equivalent (loosely) of flask's app.route decorator?
&gt; it was unintuitive that an assignment has no return value Conversely, I cannot fathom why one *would* have a return value from assignment. You are labeling a pointer, not executing a function. There's no stack frame involved, so what exactly would you be returning a value to?
You could start by reading the sidebar and then going to /r/learnpython and reading THAT sidebar which contains a bunch of great leaning resources...
Question is, is this your first attempt to learn programming? If so, start with JAVA or something with more structure so you make good habits, after that python would be easy 
Me neither. I like it. It's cute.
Python is a fine first language. Java is also fine. One's not objectively better or easier than the other.
Everything is a slippery slope, why even have opinions, blah blah blah.
I don't use that file hosting service, but like a handy little tool.
Language wise, no better or worse ofc. But Python's indentation syntax... Just think learning from languages that require you to type out everything helps you form good habits. If op was to learn another language after python, gonna be spending hours looking for missed brackets or semi-colons. 
[removed]
Ok, I see your point. The script (the `.py` file) itself does not depend on the platform.
If you're already familiar with Django's ORM, you might like [peewee](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee)

As stated in the previous answers, python would one of the worst choice simply because its one of the slowest language atm. It's because interpreted languages are much slower than compiled one in most cases. - If you need a blazing fast program everybody will tell you that C++ is the best answer although it's really challenging to learn compared to python. - You could still use python and its powerful machine learning tools to build models, just don't try to do the actual high frequency trading part with it. - A potentially good alternative would be Swift because its not _too_ far away from Python syntaxwise and it still offers great great perfs. 
How do you handle serialization? 
This is like matrix math or vectorization. Numpy is the library you are looking for!
Are you using readlines()? If so, you don’t want to do that. Look into either using readline() and looping over the file object or creating a generator.

Typed Python is so nice. It’s hard to go back.
The purpose of the article was to inform people that they can start experimenting with the new syntax today and how they can do that, it’s just meant as a very brief introduction. Might do a more in-depth follow up later about the new syntax and usecases. 
Indentation is just an alternative to curly braces; it's not too hard to remember to put curly braces around blocks when doing not-Python, even for beginners. And conversely, if OP were to learn Python after another language, you could just as well say they'd have to spend equal time cleaning up their code and removing a bunch of semicolons they unconsciously typed at the end of lines (luckily they pass silently, but still not a good look lol).

How fast are we talking? Just automated trading? Minutes, hours? Then yes. Nanoseconds? No. But of course once you get down to nanoseconds you are more concerned with latency and ping over a network, someone working with nanoseconds already has the "which language" problem worked out. I did write a cute little trading bot in Python. Worked alright, but wasn't really high frequency, the closest decisions were probably a few minutes apart. It can be done, but if you're talking about nanoseconds and miniscule spreads and massive leverage (like forex) don't use python, you'll mose money because of timing.
I don't think you understand what objectively means.
Same here, just finished our third flask microservice and we still utilize a gigantic django app as our front door
Old reddit &gt; new reddit. I still use the old ui. 
I'm concerned that this change doesn't seem pythonic. Convenient, perhaps. As you've said, it's definitely not more readable. To me, Python means clean and readable over clever and fun sugar.
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence, not data science.
Thanks. Weak reason IMO.
so it is ok to use the "with open()"? also, this should only work if the json does have multiple lines (because I have encountered a single line json file as well)
Falcon checking in.
The answer is service oriented architectures. Due to Docker and “The Cloud”. It’s much easier to develop applications that have multiple services with just a couple of endpoints. While Django offers a lot when you build monolithic applications, when you only need 3 endpoints and 2 SQL queries, Django is a big overkill.
I use the Marshmallow library, along with the marshmallow-sqlalchemy extension which makes it easy to work with SQLAlchemy models. That setup seems quite similar to the Serializers in Django REST Framework.
No one said they did a good job. In fact they messed it up quite a lot. However, the problem is that the more you resist these changes, the more you will have to reinvent them (because they exist for a reason) or make your package incompatible with the others, and since it's still your package, it's still your fault and your responsibility to keep it in a reasonable shape according to the standards of the development platform you chose. It is overwhelming because the world is complex and programming is no longer a mom and pop shop affair. Let alone regulatory requirements, these things exist because they make your life easier on other respects. Again, many things have been implemented like shit and force you to pay for things you don't use, but the truth is that either you keep moving or you are out of the game. It's always been like this. If you want a cushy job where things don't change you should have not picked programming, because stuff you learn today will be irrelevant in 3 years. 
Thanks to you i'll be rady in no time to clone the intelligence of one of my friends and add it to a chatroom :p
I think it's fine. Such a bug they're trying to avoid is very common, and even super experienced developers can fall victim to it. Plus the fallout can be disastrous. I don't feel strongly either way, but I don't disagree with the reasoning.
yes
 y = sum(m[i] * t + b[i] for i in range(n+1)) The code reads just like what you're thinking. `sum()` is a function that calculates the sum `(x for x in range(n))` is a generator expression that generates numbers in order, form the range `[0, n)` -- -- This loop/generator expression done in Python is going to be slow if you're gonna do it a lot of times. As MrFlamingQueen suggests, you should instead turn your summation into a Vector product / Matrix operation, and then use Numpy to do the calculation for you. That would speed it up by several orders of magnitude.
/r/learnpython
Wat
&gt; Django is still, imho, much easier to use as the core of a monolithic web app, This really isn't so clear to me. I've had to evaluate a few Django sites as an outsider and in each case, using Django seemed to add complexity for no great benefit (although I didn't actually say that in my evaluation because no one will thank you for saying that a decision they made years ago and can't change now was the wrong one... :-D) Do you have some specifics as to why you believe this to be the case?
I like aiohttp over flask for microservices now.
Interesting! Seems useful.
Yep this is the answer, don't bother using anything in python for that, nginx all the way 
Just realised how many ways there is to do webapps right now: 1. Twisted 2. aiohttp 3. Django 4. Flask 5. Bottle 6. Pyramid Loads of different but very similar ways of handling the exact same thing
They're asking for a function that modifies the original value of the parameters that's being passed to them.
Oooohhh, gotcha

This. Also, no one wants to do your homework for you, show us what you have done so far, and what your thinking is. Also remember to hit space 4 times to make code in the comments. amount = 100 sofa = 50 budget(amount, items=[sofa]) like that.
Trying to figure out why Jetbrains excluded secondary schools in their licensing - I've been using PyCharm and PhpStorm for the last few years to teach ~100 students across year levels programming. Those IDEs are amazing and I've got a lot of teaching resources based around them, but their student licensing now includes this weird manual process which says secondary school domains won't be added to their registration whitelist, so I'm SOL and my students will have to use the community edition (and deal with all the missing tools) or find a new IDE. I'm totally whinging and I know JB have no obligation to give us their software, but it's painful having it taken away after a few years. I teach at a girls' school and have just started the year with a class of 29 amazing female programmers beginning flask apps and another class of 25 getting into OOP and GUIs with tkinter.
You forgot 0., implement WSGI directly.
I dont think these are surprising. With the rate of growth of tech, it's not surprising many have less than 5 years experience. With good tech leads and simple languages, you can make useful use of inexperienced developers. Plus, there a lot of scope for self-published apps, and prorammers are starting younger. That 5 year professional may have started coding at 12 at home, and already worked on large open source projects before being hired. I have no idea why you'd consier python a poor choice outside of data science and web development. IT is the maintenance of internal systems. This can include programmers working on internals software, and not just network admins. In a commercial shop, your coders writing code for sale aren't part of IT, but the programmers writing the systems &amp; tools hose programmers use (tool programmers), can be argued as being part of IT. 
I like `black` it's a great autoformating tool, I run it as a githook on my projects
I would have also accepted the beaver... or going by the tremendous amount of complaining I've seen, the punisher operator. I quite like the walrus though.
You dont have to be concerned about databases or the admin page immidiately. Django does not force you to do so. You have to write pretty much the same amount of code in order to fire up your first endpoint. Also, please don't compare frameworks by "hello world" app complexity. Because there is so much more configuring afterwards in flask compared to django... and you all still use the same packages. So why would you want to configure everything by hand everytime? :)
Not weak at all. In C it has been and still is a major source of bugs.
They should have called it the "that is" operator. When I teach python, and I tell them the walrus operator, now I have to give them two bits of information to remember it. &gt; if (match := pattern.search(data)) is not None: Reads as &gt; if match, that is pattern.search(data), is not None:

When you factor in the whole ecosystem, Django is very large. I've been working with Django for over a decade so much of it is familiar and it's easy enough to keep pace, but for a newcomer it must be daunting: not just Django but DRF, Celery and so on add a big cognitive load. It's easy to see why Flask is so much easier to ramp up, you can start with a single file and a couple endpoints and add whatever packages you need. Especially as the SPA is the go-to pattern these days for web dev (for better or worse) - you just need to serve some REST endpoints and call it a day. That all said the danger of Flask - for inexperienced developers - is you eventually end up with a Frankendjango of stitched together parts rather than a coherent structure. In addition because Django has a baked in ORM, form library, admin and so on that are all designed to work together, you don't end up relying on old and out of date libraries or wasting time trying to get tests working properly with SQLAlchemy and so on- it all just works.
How did you deploy it on an intranet if you don't mind me asking?
In that sense Hypothesis doesn't fit either, since it just wraps some test function or method in a magic parameterizer. The problem of actually finding and running a Hypothesis test is still with pytest or nose or unittest or doctest or whatever! 
Make a copy for every project. It's encouraged in Python to localize your projects as much as possible to make distribution and module handling much easier. It's even encouraged to use virtualenvironments which makes a copy of the Python installation for each project.
Use: from your_pack_name.py import your_name_func 
That said I felt the same, but it is very important to understand that this complexity is oftentimes necessary and has to be implemented by yourself in one way or another if you use flask. Django comes just with a huge boilerplate and established best practices with generic views and mixing, serializes etc. This is all stuff you probably want to have at some point no matter what framework you are using. BTW I really do like flask. So I don't want to say this or that is better. Just personal experience and observation.
Yes Miguel knows certainly a lot!
&gt; \# A loop that can't be trivially rewritten using 2-arg iter() &gt; while chunk := file.read(8192): &gt; process(chunk) for chunk in file: process(chunk) 
I didn't know flask has this feature as well. Nice, one more reason to pick it up again. I actually would like to use go but there are many more jobs for python devs.

In terms of things I’ve worked on, I’ve done range and fuel missile optimizations, hypersonic missile launch design with no throttle control system (so basically a launch angle optimization to prevent burning up on launch and then time maximization at the test speed). I’ve done a shuttle insertion into orbit with launch stage recovery problem as well as single stage reentery. I wrapped OTIS with python to build the input files (so weight, inertia, aero data and constraints) and parse the output files to find things like max q (max structural loads) and max alpha*q (max heating). Then you can feed that into a more detailed structural and thermal analysis.
I can't tell if they are trying to get venture capital to build a product with a revenue stream or attract a buyout. There are some interesting things about their platform but there is also a bunch of overlap with free and dirt cheap competing services.

Reddit has an interesting history: IIRC started as Lisp, then Aaron Schwartz' old webpy framework, then Pylons (albeit so custom at this point you have to squint hard to see it). Pyramid is the bastard child of Pylons and Zope (anyone remember that?). It has a lot of interesting ideas from both but unfortunately never gained serious traction.
Helpful thank you

Flask was first (yes I know about Pylons). Pyramid also brings in some "weird" concepts from Zope like contexts and interfaces (the original developers were Zope/Plone people). It kind of all makes sense when you learn it but it's not really transferable knowledge. From an architectural purist's POV I prefer Pyramid (or for that matter, Django): I'm not a fan of Flask's global variables for request, session etc and much prefer the idea of callables taking a Request object and returning a Response. It makes things easier to reason about and, more importantly, easier to test. It's a pattern other languages/frameworks use (e.g. Go) because it's so straightforward. A global "request" (or, god forbid "g") is ripe for abuse by the lazy or inexperienced. But that all said, Flask is just easier to get started with and has less cognitive baggage.
While for any other modules it may seem the norm, it is customary to `import numpy as np` and anything else will probably cause confusion if you ever share the code. This is probably because the numpy module is so massive and most utils are usually called directly from the module itself rather than by instance methods. 
I agree. I used to have a file with all these helpers and set PYTHONPATH to include this file, but it was a mess and I don't recommend it. It gets messy as soon as you change these helpers and break old code.

I think Numpy overloads `__add__` and the sort for scalars and array-likes, so with common operators you have full vectorial operations. If you wanted a simple components, you'd resort to indexing or slicing
What issues are you experiencing with the MRs?
I'm trying to understand this, is it an operator that checks equality but also assigns that to a variable? 
^ This guys is actually right.
The pro's of packing is that you can have different versions and you can lock dependant code via [setup.py](https://setup.py) to only use a specific version. Therefore, you can control and test any potential breaking changes. This is all dependent on good git practices as well. 
Put your function into a package and pip install it. That's how python libraries were intended to be handled. It's /r/learnpython and not /r/learningpython. They both do the same thing, but one of them is small and lower quality. 
My go-to method: &gt;&gt;&gt; import foo &gt;&gt;&gt; foo.__file__ And then open the file where `foo` was defined. Sometimes the source is generated on the fly, or is linked from a library written in another language. In those cases `__file__` may not be set, or point to something useless, and then I'd search Github and places like that.
&gt; Put your function into a package and pip install it. That's how python libraries were intended to be handled. Don't worry about overhead as you only do it once, and you make your code usable for others. I'd argue that trivial functions like the example given above should NOT be shared online for others to use, as that's how you end up with the left-pad controversy that the JavaScript community had.
It took me a couple seconds, but when I saw the example in the article replacing code from the stdlib, namely something like m = something() if m: m.foo() The number of times I've written that exact syntax in python has convinced me I'll use this operator all the damn time

Hi Andrew, I didn't realize there was a /r/learnpython community. And, shame on me, I didn't read the community guidelines. Sorry about that. I will post my question on the proper community now. Thank you for taking the appropriate actions and clearing my mess. Regards, Fabio
You can install from source, e.g. [setup.py](https://setup.py), or you can host your own pypi server.
You'll pry Pyramid from my cold dead brain-computer interface. The way it's extension system &amp; resource-traversal system allow bits of code to compose and extend each other without injection, dependency loops, or other headaches... just makes large projects so easy to organize and reason about. 
cd to your home folder n type in python &lt;filename&gt;.py
Flask, the learning curve is less steep, you can create a basic hello world app with 2 files 
Yeah I don't get the downvotes
Usually, that error occurs because you’re not in the same directory as your python script. Try saving your script on your desktop. Then open terminal and type cd Desktop. Next, type ls (that’s L and S). You should see your script along with other things you have saved on your desktop listed. Lastly, type python yourScriptName.py. Your program should execute. What you’ve done is used the change directory command to move into the desktop folder. Then you used ls to list the files within this directory. Experiment with the cd command to navigate your directories. It’s similar to using finder to move files between, say, downloads and desktop. It may be useful to look up “useful bash commands” on google. You could learn to do a lot from a single terminal window. 
I did *Programming with Python for Data Science* on EdX which I found very interesting and an easy way to get a taste of this subject. Not sure if that course is still active but looks like there are some other tempting options on the EdX platform when searching for " machine learning python". If you are looking for random tutorials (which might be faster if you have a specific goal in mind) and you haven't found quite the right ones on initial searching additional keywords to include in searches are 'numpy', 'matplotlib' and 'scipy'. these are key packages for data science with python.
I think the issue is that I try to "reset/delete" the socket, but it's not really being deleted. So I try to restart it, and when I communicate with it the old one still responds. Ideally I'd like to suspend the socket for a while and be able to connect with it again. Even from another unit. I'll post my code, and hopefully that'll help clear up some confusion: """Create a tcp socket""" def create_tcp_socket(self): try: self.TCP_sock = socket.socket() except socket.error as e: print ("Socket creation error: " + str(e)) return return """Connect the tcp socket""" def connect_tcp_socket(self): try: self.TCP_sock.connect((self.server_address, self.tcp_port)) except socket.error as e: print("Socket connection error: " + str(e)) #time.sleep(5) raise try: self.TCP_sock.send(str.encode(self.get_address()) + ' ' + self.raspID) except socket.error as e: print ("Cannot send hostname to server: " + str(e)) raise return """Reset the tcp socket in case another server wants to connect""" def reset_tcp_socket(self): try: if self.TCP_sock: self.TCP_sock.shutdown(2) self.TCP_sock.close() self.TCP_sock = None self.server_address = "" print("Socket reset") else: print("reset_tcp_socket method else statement") pass except Exception as e: print("Could not close socket: " + str(e))
Sweet! I will try it out a bit later today. Thanks.
It is certainly one of my favourite features of Python &gt;=3.6. The \`mypy\` integration has been very useful in vscode.
Thanks I will check it out
Sounds like you need to move to Tableau. I was in this exact same situation, had all the data synced rom the APIs into the database but presentation was always a chore with constant changes requested. But now I've moved on to Tableau and preparing reports n Dashboard has become a breeze and so much more customizable than using a JS library. For a Business, the cost is totally justifiable.
&gt;I have no idea why you'd consier Python a poor choice outside of data science and web development. I dont
&lt;siren&gt;Learn detected&lt;siren&gt; &lt;siren&gt;delete immediately&lt;siren&gt;
Post your code. 
not if you define it with `:=`, and let `=` becomes meaningless
The third seems like a stretch. If the first can't easily be converted to some sort of iterator (and a for loop) it means you have to repeat the "next step": v = get_a_value while v: # do thing v = get_a_value which can be problematic.
It is a common issue in language with assignment-expressions, to the extent that pretty much every C compiler issues a warning by default when they see an assignment in a boolean context, unless that assignment is specifically parenthesized (and possibly a few other exceptions) aka if (a = b) { will issue a warning, and if that's what was intended has to be written if ((a = b)) { to explicitly tell the compiler that you didn't forget a character. `:=` serves the same purpose, it's fine.
It doesn't check for equality, it's just an assignment which "returns" the assigned value for being used in that place. If you want to check for equality or something else, and not just check for being something "true", you can do it like this: if (n := randint(0, 5)) == 2: ...
It solves the problem of scope. A variable only gets scoped/created only if it's going to be used. I'm personally a fan, but I lived perfectly fine without it, tbh.

If it really never changes and you have more than a few of these I have used git submodules to handle this scenario. I know it's not specific to Python but I often get to layout my projects such that if I need additional modules I have a standard project layout wherein I can just import from. The submodule aspect makes changing functionality across multiple code bases easier, but as others have said also makes your testing more important to avoid breaking things. https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules
How come you have ideas to build with Flask but not with Django? They both solve the same problem, but have different philosophies on how to do it. Just take whatever you made or are thinking of making in Flask and build in on Django.
You don't need to configure anything for Django to have working webapp. The problem is that because you can configure a lot right from the beginning people fall in the temptation to configure everything from the beginning. While in flask is not so obvious how to configure it or add complex functionality right from the beginning. Just two different ways of seeing it, not better or worse
Vibora looks very promising with Cython compiled templates and routers!
That must be awful, I haven't seen that in python projects but I suffered raw sql projects in java.
Very cool! Gonna check out your code since I can't even fathom how this was done.
I’m still not seeing how it’s being used nor an error message. From what I can see close will only unlink the socket FD from your application, it could still be in use by something else. I’m not at my computer but what I can read on github, shutdown is an asynchronous request. You’ll need to poll it to see when it actually shuts down. 
Does a python vulnerability can be affected if you use pyinstaller to an exe file?
Keep up the good fight brother. Too many people misunderstand this concept and it's important we use the correct terms.
I don't think your ideas are a coincidence: CMS-y applications are where Django truly shines (no wonder, given its pedigree) and where even I, with my rather critical view of it overall, would still pick it, even preferring it over an off-the-shelf CMS.
No. You can use some VM or Docker with Linux instead and run your code there.
Bingo. And it really doesn't take too long to just learn enough to get scripts to run. And you get to feel like a H4cker B4d4a55 typing stuff into the terminal. 
we have a large project (2M+ LOC) that is being refactored, so we have large diffs at times that are very slow to load and once they load, choke the browsers at times. Most users would never have to worry about that though following discussions/concerns during code reviews is often be confusing as a merge request evolves
you're welcome
You can try my [https://github.com/semirook/flask-kit](https://github.com/semirook/flask-kit), for example.
upvote for frankendjango
`:=` is not commonly used in python. That is what matters. I wonder why they could not just use `=`. Special operator for special case sounds like something zen of python explicitly speaks against. &gt; Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Could you shared your code, I would love to see it. Thanks.

[Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)
I’m currently documenting everything. I’ll upload as soon as it’s done. It will make it easier to understand what’s going on. 
I've been doing this a while, and I consider it an important part of my job to know my tools. 
I still hate it. It should have been with file.read(8192) as chunk: print(chunk) 
As a newbie in Flask and no experience in Django, Django terrifies me, the way it set up, there are lots of files created.
\&gt; \*laughs in [hug](http://www.hug.rest/) \*
I'd probably still use something like a simple generic generator if I was doing chunk reading of files. Something like def chunk_reader(file, chunk_size=1024): return iter(lambda: file.read(chunk_size), '') Which isn't super readable, but it's a convenience function so reading the code isn't crucial. As long as you know what it does. Same way I don't read the code for `open()`, but I will read the code that uses that `open()`. Or you can do something I never do ^^but ^^should and include documentation, a docstring like "Iterates over a file returning chunks of data up to chunk_size in size". Then whenever you want to process some file in chunks you'd use for chunk in chunk_reader(file, chunk_size=8096): process(chunk)
Not sure, but please use this as an opportunity to start using some kind of revision system.
What's weak about it? Do you have any actual arguments? What a useless response. &amp;#x200B;
And a better editor.
Did you miss KITE? It uses machine learning to predict the next attributes of the given code.
I use sublime text, but I'm sure this functionality is available in most other editors. I have gotten to the point of creating a snippet for each common function I use. So I can start typing out `rad2deg` and if I autocomplete it, it inserts def rad2deg(r): # Converts radian to degree return 180 * x / math.pi It's not practical if you're using like 20+ reusable functions in a single project. But usually I just need to pull a few. And it's nice that I can just scroll up and see the logic.
I bought a Python Masterclass on UDEMY a couple of years ago for like $10 and it has been worth vastly more than $10. People are usually on the fence about UDEMY material but I can vouch for this particular course being very thorough and professional. [Learn Python Programming Masterclass by Tim Buchalka](https://www.udemy.com/python-the-complete-python-developer-course/) Looks like it's $50 right now (for me... might just be because my account used up all its sale prices) but stuff goes on sale pretty often. It's kind of fast paced but combined with your ebooks you should be ok.
You may find r/learnpytyon to be the sub for you. 
Yeah it seems more like /u/bixmix is working in a really specific niche case. I can't imagine your average CRUD app being improved by switching from sqlalchemy to raw sql.
Oh boy... You should use git's versioning for that, not like this...
Not sure if you can recover or not. Time to learn Git, I’d say.
I’m new to GitHub. I’ll have to look into that. 
When I read about it they first time, I had 2 thoughts: &amp;#x200B; \- Wow, this is ugly. I hate it. It hurts just to look at it. Do we really neeed this? \- On the other hand, if they indroduce it and it's there, I'd probably use it. A lot.
GitHub is not the same as git BTW. It's just a platform for git
It's also less clear than writing out your code in a way that someone else can understand what you did. I'm guilty of writing difficult-to-follow code as much as anyone but I feel like one of the core principles of python is that it fosters clean, easy to understand code.
Aside from the other tips that should definitely be adopted first, if you can swing it pay for storage and have your machine continuously syncing to cloud storage
Thanks for clarifying 
I fail to see where Django is "magical".
Yeah, the new Reddit randomly forgets my settings (eg night mode) and doesn't really them until I to back to the front page and reload a few times. To add to that the new page is extremely slow and jittery. It's pretty bad compared to the old implementation. 
Having no centralised place for routes makes discoverability of your URLs impossible over the long run. When you have 50 views I damn well want a single place to get their definitions.
Try Pylint. It’s a great linter, will get you to adhere to PEP8 slowly but surely. You can also selectively disable linting in some sections of source code to suppress warnings
/r/learnpython What do you mean temporary dataset? You can randomly generate data, and keep it in memory if you want, or write it to disk if you want, and then delete it afterwards. The `tempfile` module might help you if you need to write it out and make sure it's deleted afterwards.
I don't really know what stack frames are, so I guess that's why I think differently. I'm don't really care about assignment expressions anymore and I'm not qualified to discuss whether they are good or bad. I'm just saying that something being unintuitive isn't a very good reason to dismiss it.
I did save it to GitHub 2 weeks ago I know what I should’ve done
Hmmm. You sure you haven’t even committed locally I. The last 2 weeks?
The question is, which of the parameters: first or second, is the expected value and which is the actual value. If I'm testing my code and I expect the response.status_code to be 200 and compare that with the actual response code, it would be really nice for the error message to say: I expected '200' and the actual result was '404' Maybe there's a different assert I should be using instead of assertEqual?
I suppose it's the same but different. Since MATLAB's primary function is to work with arrays and matrices. I imagine it's stream lined for certain operations relating to them. Working with arrays and matrices appear to be a secondary function ( or by product) of numpy, and so i imagine it's stream lined for something else. Obviously both assume their users will want to perform certain operations.
Hm, that's a little outside to the scope of Bandit. In answer to your question, if the exe is infected yes.
Lol, not sure how to take your comment: as a counter-argument or a cheeky commiseration on Django’s issues. 
Thank you for the replies! I'll work with those ideas to see if I can get something working. 
1. Learn from mistakes 2. Use git 3. Use a good ide with local history (pycharm tracks history very nicely) 
&gt; I'm just saying that something being unintuitive isn't a very good reason to dismiss it. Fair point. I guess you could interpret my comment to be saying what's unintuitive vs intuitive is quite subjective, which reinforces your point.
Can you get to [c9.io](https://c9.io)? I've used it for personal projects when I didn't want to have them on my local.
You don't understand how to cluster nodes in networkx given a set of node equivalence classes, *or*, you don't understand how to obtain equivalence classes of nodes in the first place? The latter question is much bigger and not a question of software implementation. The former would involve mapping one graph (the non-anonymized) to a second graph (the anonymized). In the former case you will have to think about if this is a one-time mapping, or if you should be able to add dynamically to the cluster graph. In the former case each node before clustering contains some attribute that determines if it should belong to one cluster or another. So looping over all edges, and the associated pair of nodes, you should be able to determine the *set* of cluster-cluster edges that exists via the set of node attribute pairs. From that edge list you can create the new network. Then of course the paper you link to tests ways to further reduce the edge list. But I might have misunderstood what you're really asking, because if you don't know what node clusters you're going for, then this is a question of what information you're trying to make private, and what the optimal computer scientific means to do so is.
Have you seen Python's documentation? Django is a dream, comparatively.
Lots of good stuff here. I’d also set up a script to write all daily work to a directory with the date appended to all file names. Or create a directory structure that handles date tracking. Why? Because Git and an IDE I was useing conspired one day to delete everything. Local storage is never secure from IDE errors, fat finger mistakes or any other data loss glitch. If your laptop supports it use an SD card for this auto backup usage. A separate storage device adds a tiny bit more security. By the way this doesn’t mean give up on off machine storage as that needs to be part of any good backup system. Even here I’d try for at least two avenues. GitHub makes sense but so does magnetic storage in the desk, safe or even a bank vault. To put it lightly I’ve been screwed over by bad behavior in an editor or IDE more than once. Like most things playing a good defense is your only real protection. Daily backups might not be enough either, you have to figure out how much value you put into your work on an hourly basis. Best of luck with your recovery. Never did this with Idle so I can help with specifics here. 
Using NetworkX to perform a social network analysis for my University project. Also if anyone knows any other approach for SNA please let me know.
I'm seriously asking because I've been using Django for a decade and its internal are generally very explicit in how they work and in not having to use any built-in functionality that you don't intend to use. The closest I see is the model loading internals, which is not more magical than most ORMs either.
Unless you deleted your .git directory, git didn't delete anything. `git reflog -a` is your friend. 
One major area no one talks about is context of code and project set up. How should I structure folders in each project? What is a requirements.txt? What is a setup.py? How do you make scripts usable? Theres loads of info about the most micromanaging aspects of python, amd next to nothing that clearly explains how to start and the meaning / importance of these things.
The oreilly flask book @ [https://flaskbook.com](https://flaskbook.com/#) has a pretty good section on how to use sqlalchemy with flask using the plugin: [http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/2.3/](http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/2.3/).
oops yeah sorry, this technology thing is confusing
Agree. Git submodule for your common utility bits makes you feel shiny and clean instead of dirty. You then don’t fret over making changes to them nearly as much. 
OP stated they are a student, they can likely get this for free. A lot of universities offer “unlimited” cloud storage though box/google drive
Local machine?
I’m not sure what the IDE did (pyDev on Eclipse) but I was so pissed I didn’t even look at the machine for days. 
Hijack: never used flask but doing some boot camp tuts on Django, pros / cons anyone? 
I used to have a CentOS server at home with port forwarding so i could access it from anywhere with putty.
it looks amazing, id love to see this format on a IDM video or something like that
This is like the 4th or 5th tool doing exactly this in the last few weeks. Seems like you guys should all talk.
All true (at least from what has been reported). But what do you mean by &gt; then Pylons (albeit so custom at this point you have to squint hard to see it)
Can't do that here. I have rights to run putty. I'm only a standard user at work.
I think there's a difference between the way the python and js communities approach such matters. There already are quite a lot of little libraries up on pypi that are pretty obviously little utility packages that are designed just for the author like this. Nobody is depending on them, and then depending on those packages, and so on like the node ecosystem does. I'm not able to make anything better than an uninformed guess as to how these differences came to be, but I think it's fine for a Python dev to put reusable library code up on pypi with a clear conscience. 
exercism.io?
I'm a Python noob of sorts so this is a struggle. **Problem:** Slack messaging's built in notification is notoriously brief with a sound and a few seconds of a popup before auto-dismissing. Users are forgetting to check Slack for messages in a time sensitive industry. This behavior is not what my coworkers want, since our old messaging system would leave a message window on the screen and not auto-dismiss. **Possible Solution:** Write a Python script that monitors Slack Messaging on the Intertubes for Direct Messages sent to the specific user and display a notification (tkinter window) to remind them to look at official Slack client windows software running in the system tray. The notification does not go away until closed with an 'OK' button. **Current Status:** After days of fiddling with the API, as of yesterday, I am able to see the Slack messaging stream come in to my Python program and parse it. Every steps been hard fought since I'm such a newb but ultimately satisfying when I succeed in getting to the next step (challenge). **Tools:** Python 3.6.3 with Slack's Real Time Messaging API. So far it's been a struggle since Slack's API and security token system is quite complex in it's offering. I settled on their RTM API offering with a Slack "Client" token to get the job done. **Optional Features:** 1. Sender Username and Message displayed in tkinter popup. 2. Allow user to type a response in the tkinter popup notification. 
1st of all, thanks for the response. You also got me thinking that maybe I'm not understanding how Python works, so I'll take a step back... If I run this code: `import pandas as pd` `data = [['Alex',10],['Bob',12],['Clarke',13]]` `df = pd.DataFrame(data,columns=['Name','Age'])` `print df` &amp;#x200B; Is df saved permanently somewhere? Or does it get deleted after I close out of my session?
let's be honest the only reason this shit was added is to promote woman in tech. While I agree that we should support them and promote them being in tech as much as we can, but man, not this way by ruining it all. 
In order to understand what I mean, you probably need to have enough data where it makes a big difference. Cursory glance by just simple timing for the two methods (psql COPY FROM versus execute_batch will let you know if you actually have a difference). When you dig into psycopg2's implementation, you'll find that they don't actually use the postgres protocol. They translate (it's not a simple cast) all values into a few choice types and then push those back to postgres at which point, postgres has to translate them back into standard types. It's a hack that should have been removed a while ago, but hasn't gotten time for it because not enough people complain (probably because there aren't enough people who have large enough data sets).
Any jupyter hosting?
There's 10+ years of custom code written on top of the basic Pylons setup - although Pylons itself was pretty light (akin to Flask). That said it's been a while since I've seen their source code and it might have been refactored since then.
That's actually really clever. I wonder if there's a way in PyCharm to design a plugin to auto-create macros by parsing a `.py` file.
Ah, yeah, as someone who's spent a lot of time in it I'm pretty well acquainted as well. To understand put yourself in someone new's shoes. They go and read a tutorial on Django. First they install it and then initialize a project. Whoa, tons of stuff there. Lots of directories and files the tutorial doesn't have them touch at all. These are necessary, and to an advanced user hold lots of great places for additional tweaking, but for the n00b it's overwhelming. At first it just seems "magical." The tutorial says "put routes here, views here, business logic here." Now flip to a flask tutorial. Nothing initializes. Project structure doesn't exist unless the user makes it exist. There are some decorators that let you start abstracting things like routes, but for small projects with a UI some tutorials just have the user writing templates right in a single file. Single file MVC if you like. No black box, no magic, just transparency. &amp;#x200B; That's what I mean.
\&gt; Also, please don't compare frameworks by "hello world" app complexity "hello world" app complexity is all I need though. Right now my work involves static html and two api endpoints, one of which serves a translation model we're training and the other one gathers feedback. It's good that Django doesn't require implementing those parts if you don't want them. The new django project setup thing always generates the code for admin pages and DB models, so I thought it was enforcing that structure instead of suggesting it. I'll have to take another look at the docs and try another sample project. 
It is possible, you need a mutable type of some kind. Either define one yourself or make sofa not like \`sofa=50\` but rather \`sofa=\[50\]\`
I agree, this does seem possible.
Probably all IDE's autoindent/curly brackets for you or there's a shortcut to prettify so not an issue here. I've gone this path starting with python and the transitioning to C# had an issue maybe fir few days max
Is [repl.it](https://repl.it) a filter, I use that!
You can probably be able to load it memory if it's in one file then write a script to split into x files. With the data partitioned into multiple files it will be easier to load into your database one at a time
If you paste the token here, can it be decoded by this page? https://jwt.io If so, you can do it in code. If not, then it isn't a valid JWT according to the specification or it is using some non-standard algorithm. 
There is a couple of phone apps but they are a bit awkward and limited 
That dataframe is in RAM, as is the list of lists you created it from. It is owned by python (which allows python to delete it from RAM when it's no longer required, a process called garbage collection). It can be written out to a file if you want, but there are lots of different formats which you might choose to use. Very rarely does a library save something to the hard drive unless either you tell it to, or that's explicitly what it's for. This is because hard drive reads and writes are slow, and not necessary in most cases.
I see. I wasn't aware of that. Did you try [asyncpg](https://github.com/MagicStack/asyncpg)? Seems like it is another take at PostgreSQL and it is claimed to be faster than psycopg2.
Just create a private GitHub monolith repo for all your code and publish to that. Enjoy deleting your file archiving script.
Yes it can be. Tried it out before but not sure what package to use in python as some of the examples seem confusing. Looking for advice.
I am interested in it...but I haven't been brave enough to start injecting our code with asyncio, which seems to be insidious in how async / await pop up all over the stack. If I felt like it could be better isolated, I would be more likely to try it, but the implementation of python's async concurrency library is somewhat prohibitive there. That said, there are some cases where multiprocessing with multiple cores is far better for our work. And that is actually more straight-forward and less invasive to use. So we are using that. However, for some of the bigger io bound spaces, I'd definitely like to look into asyncio. For a read query, I'm not sure it makes much sense because a majority of the work being done is formulating a response and just waiting on postgres to build that data set. The situation where I could see a read query fitting better is when there are a large number of reads that all can happen asynchronously. This makes more sense at a lower level than my application where I have a REST server that wants to handle more nodes connecting to it. For our use case, it may make sense to include Magic Stack in a bulk ETL where I have thousands of files that can all be loaded independently from multiple data pipelines. And this is where I am most curious. I have some portions of the ETL pipeline that are cpu intense and multiprocessing helps. I also have some portions where I can tell that the CPU is mostly idle and I am waiting for postgres to process the data. I'm going to spend some time here with async to see if/how I can speed that up. &amp;#x200B;

Install a portable version of python on a USB stick. That way you can take it with you and you don't have to install anything on your work machine. 
Because those are not the same thing? kwargs is a dictionary (a hashmap). 
Can you explain why SQL and not something like MongoDb? I think MongoDb is easier because I can put whatever I want in it, whereas SQL has to have the same structure.
The Redis implementation is brilliant
Post one of your jwt's. 
That was the MongoDB story about 8 years ago. Today, SQL can handle unstructured JSON with good performance in Postgres. Maybe you should take another look there. Also, we don't build unstructured data; we have very well structured data.
pythonanywhere.com has a free tier for low volume personal use. 
I use google chrome remote connect to my home pc and code on my home pc :D Short of that I've used [repl.it](https://repl.it) or codeacademy. If you're like me, the usb stick won't work, they lock down the usb ports :(
Its encrypted so not sure how that'll help. Not able to do that right now but just looking for recommendations on a python library or any examples.
OK, I had a few minutes to help but without a sample jwt, I can't. Good luck. 
Could try Azure notebooks. Doubt it’s blocked. 
They didn't write a word about [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/). With the python API, it's really easy to write an ETL pipeline.
By the way, jwt's are not encrypted. They are signed. Anyone can read what's in a jwt. Don't put sensitive information in one. If you have encrypted one outside of the normal generation of a jwt and you can't decrypt it in python, then this isn't a jwt issue. 
Fair enough. I just wanted to ask for a recommended approach. Not at work atm so cant create a fake encrypted JWT. I'm just doing general research at home on best practises for decryption using python but most examples show that you have to encrypt with python as well so that won't work for me. Thanks any way 
Flask does 2 things for me; talking to the data provider, and doing calculations on the data. As of now, there is no need for user sessions, or database. It does those 2 jobs well, without the forced bulk of Django.
That's not true. I have created jwt's &amp; read them in Java, Javascript, Ruby and Python. It's very interchangeable. You just have to make sure the algorithms match up. 
The thing with Plotly is that it is quite slow, even the customized Plotly is slow. I am still using Plotly, and I do hope that one day I am diligent enough to make a charting method from scratch.
Flask is more modular and encourages you to build your own way of doing things with various modules (only adding what you actually need), Django has a set "best" way to approach most things your project and is thus more comprehensive than Flask out of the box. That's what I gathered in simple terms when I was researching them.
but a dictionary consists of **k**ey-**v**alue pairs...
Oh... ok. I get it now. Thank you so much. Last Q: Should I want to save my df out to a permanent file, I just do to\_csv correct?
Make a 'common' project/package.. Then group the stuff that has common functionality into different namespaces in that common package: common/ math/ exception/ conversion/ ..etc... Then you can use setup.py to package it for your OS..Then you can use that as a dependency for your endgoal projects.
Too slow. Current HFT work ended up sponsoring things like the compiler explorer so that engineers could gauge whether certain constructs of C++ are fast enough to be safe to use. Python is right out.
If you only use them locally, you might want to make a package with them and put it in your PYTHONPATH environment variable. This way you can import it from any project as if it was a standard library module. I don't actually use this myself often but when I do need to share code across local projects that's what I usually do. If you are collaborating on this project, uploading them to PyPI would probably be the best option.
Host a jupyter notebook server at home, and log into it with your browser at work. 
Where’re you based? Sounds like we could use a guy like you. 
Congratulations! They look nice :)
That is all well and good but I’ve suffered from network outages more than once in life. Sometime an intentional get away from everything vacation but sometimes technical failures of one sort of another. So while the Github option makes sense in a world of perfect internet connectivity that internet can sometimes go away just when you need it. There is also the aspect of people actually taking responsibility for machine maintenance. There is actually a ton of ways for people to do backups. As such a person needs to work out what works best for him. 
Do you have access to Windows Linux Subsystem?
Are you talking about using Redis for background jobs? That's not exactly uncommon, or good. 
Thanks. TIL. I currently use the Google Datastore, I can probably switch to Postgres since it's free. I am storing time series, and I thought only flexible database can do this. &amp;#x200B;
New Jersey
If you are really doing time series in a way that is required (e.g. monitoring/logging), you should definitely look into something optimized for time series like TSDB. It's unclear what your use-case is, though. Also, in my experience, it's rare that you cannot actually build a static structure for most data. In some cases, that means that portions of the fields are None or Null or empty. In other cases, we simply use different data types.
From a beginners standpoint it explains it very well. 
more than 9 there and no mention of Airflow.
Nice to see PETL there. I friggen love it - for some reason the API really resounds with me. It’s what a pick up if I need to do some quick dirty csv transformations most of the time. More beginner friendly than pandas IMO (although nowhere near as powerful). 
Personally think that Aiohttp is the best async alternative to flask, there are some differences but it's very robust. 
&gt; I feel like desktop apps feels old Users don't care if it "feels old". What they want is an application that saves them time. They really don't give a shit if it's using the latest "cool" framework or the latest libraries, or even if it's on mobile. They certainly don't want their application to be dependent on a certain type of browser and they don't want to have to log in separately from their domain login. Look in any business environment and you will see many desktops with multiple large monitors. They have that real estate for a reason. They don't want wasted white space that you see in so many web apps. Other things users want are keyboard short cuts and tab stops that are meaningful. They don't want to have to use their mouse all the time. 
Basically I will make an input and the user will be able to type sofa and amount . If the user will type sofa then 100-50 the output will be 50 and after that the user will be able to type amount and so the output will be 50. Anyways thanks guys 
also look at this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/519633/lazy-method-for-reading-big-file-in-python
You're about the tenth person to tell me that. I haven't been able to get buy-in from the decision makers on such a thing. There are a couple older, non technical founders that want to keep getting the same excel sheets they have always gotten. 
A dictionary is the structure you’re putting in there, but it’s being put in there to simulate [keyword arguments](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-argument). Similar to how we use *args, not *lst. 
Not a single mention of Slinkie. Crazy.

Don't get it 
I know, but there is a lot of support for JWE (Json Web Encryption) to encrypt the payload of a JWT and that's what we do with our ASP.Net web app so maybe I just need to decrypt using some other non-JWT library first if that's the case. There is good middleware for ASP.Net Core that can do both processes at the same time so I thought maybe a python library would support both. 
In my opinion, the best part about Flask is that it is not opinionated. It supplies you with the basics and lets you figure out the other components (ORM, session management, etc). This makes it really easy for beginners while being extremely flexible. Django on the other hand follows a 'batteries included' approach. It includes everything and expects you to do things in a certain way. It is also more difficult for beginners. For small projects, I would suggest you to use Flask. There is minimum boiler code and is relatively easy to learn. For large scale projects, Django is the way to go.
LOL. No. I think you have a power user in mind. My time-series usage is for my personal portfolio. I have an app that is run on a scheduler that rebalances the weight in my portfolio. Basically, I can re-get the data (api provided by data vendor), crunch it through the app, and it will spit out the outcome (weights). But, it is much faster if I locally (cloudly?) store the underlying/historical prices instead of repeatedly requesting it from the data provider and running it through the app. So, when I say time series, it is a just daily data, not some minute by minute log from a server or some other high-performance-needed system.
I was referring to the examples I tried following. I assumed JWTs were interchangeable like you said because they follow a standard specification so I was surprised why I couldn't get the libraries I tested to work for my scenario. [Jose](https://python-jose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwk/api.html) seems to support encryption and decryption but I was having difficulty and wondered if there was some better examples or some sort of tutorial online which might help me out.
I don’t think this makes any sense. 
The bird is you, when you don't programme you do repetives tasks, it's show in picture 1 by the idea to add stone by stone to get water. Then you have programmer, that know how to create a pipe to drink. Finally, with python you can make a pipe that will suit your need and not only suit your purpose. 
To my untrained eyes this reads like something an AI might have produced after to much of a digital equivalent of scotch. I am getting the JARVIS part but not the unused memory from the net part. Not sure what you are trying to achieve there. 
You can call it what you want though ;) Maybe people in scandinavia call them kvargs. def f(**kvargs): ... works.
Oh seems like the rocks are getting stuck in the straw.

Didn't really deploy it per se. Usually it just gets tossed on a raspberry pi for a live dashboard.
Yep, I have a core app I am building - it will mostly be the same between Android, iPhone and web - and so I'm using Django with a React frontend that'll largely be the same on each platform with minor differences. If I had to add unrelated technology to it, I'd build it in as a microservice though.
Would you say it's better than Django REST framework for API endpoints?

Your use-case sounds like a cron-based task rather than a full-blown app. And I would suspect that it would be far more performant if you ran it locally than in a cloud-based server. I am guessing it'd certainly be cheaper. The reasons you'd want to do something cloud based are pretty basic: 1. You want a resume builder 2. You want to learn something 3. You actually have too much data to fit into or process on your local machine 4. You really need to have a 100% up-time service that lets other systems/people/services pull from your data
Point me at a video and I’ll see what I can do
No cell phones at work :(
Yeah, no USB. Can't install Chrome either.
Nope 
1,2,3, and 4 are all applicable to me. 1 - Yes. This is also part of my portfolio. I just want to show my coding skills. My spiel is that I am a financial analyst who codes. 2 - Yup. I have learned how to deploy to Heroku and Google App Engine. You know how many deploys I have to Heroku? More than 100. LOL. Also, **Python IS the easy part, seriously it is.** The hard part? Figuring how to setup the deployment environment, figuring all these non-sensical Javascript package, CSS, AJAX and so on. 3 - Not really, but I don't have a physical server. So, I have to use the cloud. 4 - Yes, I have an online app that lets people play with and interact with the data, because of 1.
I don't think it is that big a deal if he is posting actually new and relevant things about embedded python. But it's the same app note link every couple of mobths.

Non programmers like to put their rocks in glasses of water. Programmers like drinking water. Python programmers drink rocks with their water. 
that's rough man, have you considered a pi and a kvm-switch? there's a # FJGEAR 2 Ports USB 2.0 HDMI KVM Switch on sale... (thinking outside the box) or a personal laptop or a tablet with a case/blue tooth keyboard... or... read books write psudo code and draw flowcharts for software and then type when you get home? sorry man, I'm out of suggestions. Let me know if you come across a good option.
Well, everywhere else I saw the term 'named argument', in any language that had that feature.
Yup, that’s why I linked to the python docs for the python name for this concept. 
The hard part is broadly called "dev ops"... outside of data science, it's probably the fastest growing domain for programming and things are getting pretty complicated at this point. However, there's also a trend to minimize that complication: containers or lambda. Using a container technology will isolate a majority of the package and environment problems letting you cleanly deploy into an environment that doesn't care what's running as long as the container is specified. Your container runs exactly the same way on a local machine vs a remote machine, so that makes testing/debugging a snap. &amp;#x200B; That said, another approach is to use something like AWS lambda, which basically handles all of the infrastructure and lets you focus entirely on code/application.
scandinavia isn't transylvania but yeah .. I don't expect Americans to know European geography ;)
Sorry, was trying to make a parallel joke. Not American btw. 
A node in networkx can be another graph. In theory your clusters could be graphs of the clustered nodes and edges. It would be up to your implementation to expose the inner graph or not...or just the cluster relationships.
I guess that whooshed past me
&gt; "And, we hope to find the answer to that very question: which programming language is best." Ooooh boy. Gonna have my popcorn ready for that instalment.
Isn't that what Dyno is in Heroku? I just put all the required package into a list, specify which python version I need, specify which addons (like postgres) I need and I am done. 
I bought Miguel's book and have read through some of it. I've found that the book presumes that the reader is already coming from some kind of web development background (which is not me). Does the tutorial make the same assumptions? 
Came here for this comment, pyspark is not only super easy to use but also super reliable and, since its built on top of Apache Spark, it has a pretty great documentation. &amp;#x200B; While you could argue that "using Scala would be just better", that not only is impractical in many real life situations, but also wouldn't be enough to not classify pyspark as a great ETL framework.
Wow, thanks for doing this. I just completed my first flask project and I needed this kind of guidance. Saved!

Not exactly. They're comparable in some ways, I suppose. Lambda only runs when you actually request data from it where as a Dyno is going to be on a node and running 100% (or whatever you get on your free tier - I think like 75%?) of the time... Lambda, from your general perspective as a developer, is leaner.
This really throws the whole article into question. I'm in data &amp; ETL and Airflow is definitely one of, if not the, biggest players in the game right now.
For the most part we are designing a feedback control system. However, when we say real time, we mean in the realm of a few seconds to a minute depending on the specific mission. Once the vehicles begin their trajectories, we will use a lower level controller to keep them on course and obstacle avoidance techniques to avoid re-planning the entire mission. Those projects you've worked on sound incredibly interesting! 
I see. The free Dyno doesn't run all the time. The cheapest one, $7/month, which is what I have, runs all the time.
Find an interesting project that forces you to jump into the deep end. I found that I learned much quicker working on interesting projects rather than repeating toy examples. If you're alright with paying about $50 USD you can enter into the Formula Pi competition where you program robots that race around a track. You could also try out some of the AI competitions out there. I can't think of any off the top of my head that are currently going, but Halite is a good example.
I get a lot of people checking out my app - Housenet on GitHub: https://github.com/0Hughman0/Housenet I think it's useful for a few reasons: * Use of Bootstrap * Use of the app factory structure * Use of flask-SQLAlchemy I definitely wrote it with the intention of others spying over my code. I also have another project, RamCal which is also based on flask: https://github.com/0Hughman0/RamCal RamCal is more about pushing for functionality rather than writing a perfect flask app, but it demonstrates a few things: * Working with the Google Calendar API * Basic use of Vue.js * Single page application style structure. And I will be actively developing this app further in the next few months, so watch it develope!
Use git locally, and push to github. whenever you add a file to your project: git add &lt;filename&gt; when you want to save new code to git (Do this often. Like dozens of times a day.

As someone new to web dev, you have so aptly put my experience on starting with django and then switching to flask. It's very analogous to a starting programmer with Java: what is static, void, String[]? Newcomers would be told to just gloss over those details for now, but told that they're needed, and they have importance. Django follows that same philosophy and very much appears magical. I think after I've spent enough time in Flask I'll revisit Django, especially if a project warrants it. 
I'll look it up, thank you
I’vent used it. I was looking to build stuff up from near the ground floor and not have to invest too much in learning a larger ecosystem than what I needed. If I were doing hybrid sites of majority dynamically rendered templates and then adding smaller bits of JSON / REST APIs, then starting with Django would probably make sense. As you move more towards preponderance of API and less dynamic page content, then Flask is probably more natural. Let’s all just hope that GraphQL doesn’t kill off the programmed middle tier entirely. 
This code works perfectly, I am kind of confused but let me explain this from my knowledge. NOT in boolean logic does flip a value, NOT TRUE = FALSE so you are correct there. Also in python if you want to do Is Not then you can use !=. Tell me if this is not the answer you wanted.
You have a couple of bugs and then a number of things you can improve: In terms of bugs: 1. you create `quarters_int` and then use `quarters` 2. you are missing a comma in your print statement So, for the first fix, you'll get: change_str=input("How much change do you have?") change_int=int(change_str) quarters=change_int//25 change_left=quarters%25 dimes=change_left//10 change_left=change_left%10 nickels=change_left//5 change_left=change_left%5 pennies=change_left print("The correct change is",quarters,dimes,nickels,pennies) If you want clearer output, you can format your string output Python 3.6+: print(f"The correct change is {quarters} quarters, {dimes} dimes, {nickels} nickels, and {pennies} pennies") Python &lt; 3.6: message_template = "The correct change is {quarters} quarters, {dimes} dimes, {nickels} nickels, and {pennies} pennies" message = message_template.format(quarters=quarters, dimes=dimes, nickels=nickels, pennies=pennies) print(message) Based on your repeated use of division and modulus, you might want to use [divmod](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#divmod) I would also recommend keeping a running change tally and adding some spaces around operators to make your code easier to read: change_str = input("How much change do you have? ") change = int(change_str) quarters, change = divmod(change, 25) dimes, change = divmod(change, 10) nickels, change = divmod(change, 5) pennies = change print( f"The correct change is {quarters} quarters," + f" {dimes} dimes," + f" {nickels} nickels," + f" and {pennies} pennies" )

&gt;What I'd really like now would be a good tutorial on SQLAlchemy with Flask so I'm not writing raw SQL queries. Honestly having used both Django and SQLAlchemy for projects, my advice would be to just skip both and go for a good NoSQL database. Django's ORM and how it fits into the Django workflow is probably the best experience you can have writing code that uses a relational database. SQLAlchemy + Alembic for schema migrations is... clunky. If you want to do anything approaching the kind of complexity that you get out-of-the-box with Django's ORM, then you have to know SQLAlchemy's ORM, you have to know Alembic's quirks, and you have to understand whatever relational database you are using. SQLAlchemy + Alembic has so much support for legacy systems that it's significantly easier to just write raw SQL and manage your schema manually than to configure SQLAlchemy to do what you want. I switched to using NoSQL (DynamoDB specifically) and haven't looked back since. If you're starting a new project today and you don't have to support any legacy systems, then go with something like that. Or go hybrid and use PostgreSQL as a NoSQL database, where you keep each document as a JSON field and use different columns as keys by which to access that field. The amount and complexity of SQL you have to write by hand is trivial, you get PostgreSQL's scalability, caching becomes trivial, and if you really really need, you can use some relational aspects as well.
Thanks! It's close! It's this part right here: while guess != secret\_word **and not**(out\_of\_guesses): I get the first part: while guess !=secret\_word The second part: and not(out\_of\_guesses): I set the out\_of\_guess = False to start off with. As the user makes mistaken guesses the guess count goes up by 1. After the 3rd missed guess out\_of\_guess goes to True. Wouldn't the "not" statement switch it back from True to False? 
I think you should use &amp;#x200B; while guess != secret\_word and out\_of guesses != True. &amp;#x200B; I understand what you are asking but I honestly cannot explain it myself the answer is kind of yes, but it is different context because it is a while loop.
As someone who had no background in web development, I liked learning the opinionated structure of Django because it helped me understand some of the compartmentalizations of tasks (or at least the CMV approach to it). I wish I had taken the plunge with learning the framework sooner... so many places say “don’t learn a frame work right away”. I think that’s bad advice because trying to build things using vanilla is and html and css isn’t always rewarding enough to keep new developers motivated by their progress. Anyway... you guys can tell me if you think I’m wrong but just my two cents.
THANK YOU! I have a fairly seriously project relying havely on asyncio and this misconception was biting me in the ass. I had no idea why my coroutines did not run even though I awaited a lot. @OP: In case you havent written the article yet. this \^\^\^. Also during my first steps with asyncio I got really confused between coroutines, tasks and futures.
hey, I had the same thing typed up as well. You had it in the post and in the image. If anything, I gave multiple options to look at what I needed help with So, I don't really see your point? Though this is a good learning exerpince for me, how would *you* post something that everyone in the groups you mentioned would able to read or hear (in the case of text to speech) code that you wanted to post? I will do my best to post it the way you do because I'm sure everyone in the world can see it in the way you do it. You know, unless reddit is blocked, they don't have internet, they don't have a phone, laptop, etc. Thanks for your input! 
Well done!
Thanks I really like them!
Thank you it means a lot!
These are links to my flask based projects. Maybe this will help... https://keeplink.in/meta-git https://keeplink.in/mail-git 
Since people here seem to know about ETLs: what is a good ETL for a general command line app that does image processing? I think ETL is a great fit for this (extract data from image, transform image in various ways, save as different images/data; allows one to define filters and rearrange them in useful ways) but most ETL frameworks are quite heavyweight, requiring database servers or MQs for backends and such. What's good for an ephemeral, localhost job that goes away in a few minutes?
For all your question on learning process in python, you should as your question in r/learnpython. What you want to achieve can be easily done with `pandas` have look on it, if you have questions regarding how to use it, ask them in r/learnpython. 
I was using it on a school computer and I could only run IDLE on the firewall
For your first two python programs that is incredibly solid. Hope you will advance further. :D
If you want to save it in CSV format, yes ;) There are plenty of options for file formats, but for many applications, CSV does indeed hit the sweet spot of machine readable, human readable, and easily accessible tooling (e.g. excel).
I’m a bit confused, but it sounds like you might be thinking that the Not operator is reassigning the value of your variable. The Not operation just gives you the boolean inverse value of what ever variable it is operating on. It does not change the value of that variable. Try something like this to clarify: out_of_guesses = False print(not out_of_guesses) # prints true print(out_of_guesses) # prints false If I’m misunderstanding you, feel free to ignore my help 😋 Cheers! S. 
Nice! The concept behind this is really good, but you've got a lot to learn in terms of organizing code. I may make a PR against this a bit later.
Sorry, these are not my "first" but just my first proper projects that took a lot of time instead of testing.
/r/learnpython, read the sidebar, and format your code for reddit (see "formatting help" below the input text box)
R has had this for a long time, nice to finally see it making to python. It's very useful.

Thank you so much for the help! I really appreciate it.
&gt;So he said that in order for this to work all files that you are currently working on needs to be in the same folder and Python will automatically pick up the location path and open the file without extension as long as the name is correct, That's a contradiction, the file extension is part of the file name. If you don't know the complete file name then you have to search for it AFAIK.
I second learning Pandas for formatting your data. At my last job I built my own data structure using class objects and complicated print statements to show current progress and finished result. It was the first package I learned at my current job. So easy to use and extremely versatile. 
These look so good. I'm a big fan of GUIs as well. I'm still on some youtube tutorial courses and still learning the basics. I hope I can get to your level some day.
Exactly, and what is also very strange is that before, about two weeks ago he showed us other examples where he used full file name like open("example.txt") and now he stopped doing that and is only using the name with no extension and it's still working for him... I don't know... I have another class next week and I may need to ask him what kind of black magic he's using.
Good work! Are they on Github?
This looks awesome, thanks.
Not quite what you are asking, but I recently went through this book (which uses Flask) and it was a great introduction https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/ai9em2/i_wrote_a_free_book_about_tdd_and_clean
I like how readable your example is. But how would I recognise if this is a context-manager or not? These are completely different solutions for complete different problems.
A dictionary is more than key/value pairs. The latter could be implemented in a number of ways, including as a list. That would make the access time linear wrt the number of entries. A python dictionary has an access time constant in the number of entries.
[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3103/#rejection-notice](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3103/#rejection-notice) states "A quick poll during my keynote presentation at PyCon 2007 shows this proposal has no popular support.

&gt; pip problems &gt; &gt; from ruggernugger &gt; &gt; totally understand if you don't feel like helping me with this issue, but i figured i'd follow up because i couldn't manage to reply in a comment; pip is version 19.0.1, for python 3.7, and my python installation is 3.7.2. im on windows 
Also security?! Like django is pretty secure, me building a session management system will be prone to man in the middle attacks, injections amd god knows what.
Ni-Fi in my opinion is one of the best tools for streaming data ETL, and we use it in our company on a daily basis. It is backed by Apache, and is widely used in production.
Great. Better to "bring your own features" than "code your own features"...
Neat! Good work!
Awesome. So it's not a free tool? (Sorry for being cheap...)
dictionaries can be implemented in various ways (usually tree or hash table) dictionaries consist of key-value pairs but the order is not specified
Thanks a ton! :)
Now to use python3.7 type: python3 and test PyQT5. 
It's hard to top all the Wordpress features with Django though...
just copy. i like everything local. if you make it a package, you’ve now linked perhaps unrelated projects together. 
I have a folder called (very originally :-) mypython which is on PYTHONPATH and in there I have a file called (ditto :-) myutils for the really general purpose stuff. Other stuff goes into mymoney, mytrig etc. It's worked for me for nearly 20 years so why should I try anything smarter? YMMV.
&gt; python dictionary
I'd say they still count for my respect. 
If you feel like rolling your own check out [https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict), the examples given are pretty much self explanatory.
this is really a dumb question, but is just install the package on the project or vscode and thats it?
sadly thats not possible because there are other dependencies that are windows only :/ &amp;#x200B;

Since your tutor said as long as the files are in the same folder they will be automatically picked up, s/he must be talking about iterating the current folder contents. This one of multiple ways (it can be further refactored, but it should do the trick): &amp;#x200B; \# import Path class from pathlib from pathlib import Path &amp;#x200B; \# pick the current location's path (current folder) here = Path(".") &amp;#x200B; \# now we iterate over the contents of the current folder for path in here.iterdir(): \# only process if it is a file if path.is\_file(): \# convert path to string and pass to function readWordsInsideFile(str(path))
Sure, which is why it makes sense only if you develop something that will live for a long time, has a need to keep development staff/contractors anyway for some reason, and hopes to differentiate (not the same as "overtake") itself from Wordpress. Tricky.

If the file has an extension, it is part of the file name and should be specified. If the file name *has no extension*, then no extension should be specified. In other words, extensions are not a mandatory part of file names, even though they're a bit atypical, especially on Windows.
Your tutor is not very good. Actually, completely incorrect. Programming languages, operating systems, and computers, in general, do not make assumptions. They do, only as asked. The only way it would work as the tutor specified is if the file doesn't have an extension (which is perfectly reasonable). Extensions aren't a separate part of the file name anyway, they are just parsed out by the OS to perform things based on the .ext part. A file can be 'file.ext' or it can simply be 'file'. If you ask python to read 'my\_file' and a file with that path doesn't exist then it can't read it. What will happen if you don't provide a full-path e.g. /path/to/my/file.ext but rather simply file.ext is that python will search the current working directory for that file. &amp;#x200B; I would recommend finding a new tutor and perhaps asking to see a resume before hiring.
Agreed and beat you to it with the PR :)

This appears to be [a very old bug in IDLE](https://bugs.python.org/issue13153) (probably related to Unicode limitations in TCL/TK).
Very good indeed, did you spend how many months studying to get this good ?

100% the only way that works is if the file is called "words" with no extension and is in the same directory. Otherwise you need to use '/path/to/file/words', deal with os-specific pathing, or iterate over directories/files using stuff like os.path.walk. This seems like a shortcut for the tutor to keep the code a little cleaner, maybe?
Know of any resources on how to fill that gap?
Does cp.read parse a string or read a file at that path? I bet its the first one.
That's entirely free! We are developing 3 products: [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com), [Tech.io](https://Tech.io) and [CodinGame for Work](https://www.codingame.com/work/). Only the last one isn't free: we are selling technical tests to companies that want to assess applicants, and we organize private programming contests.
Your function takes a "filename" parameter. How do you call the function? That will be where the file extension will be: readWordsInsideFile(file.txt)
In this case, `while guess != secret_word and not(out_of_guesses):` would be the same as `while guess != secret_word and out_of_guesses == False:`
Oh god the new UI is so bad. I live in fear of the old.reddit.com going away. Then again it might be what I need to break my addiction.

No you install with pip install and you can run with `black name-of-file-or-dir` and it will format everything. It's good to run as a git hook (just make a bash file that runs it). I dont bother with it in vscode or whatever because its run by git then.
Anything for the standard libraries are harder to read to me than Django's docs, that's all.
OP please link if so
Try an absolute path to State.ini instead of just the filename. Probably you are running from a current directory other than where that file is.
Man if the internet's not working neither am I. 
what do you mean by the whole subreddit? you just mean all the submissions? you’re probably better off spending your time just making it rather than looking for one. it’d be a pretty straight forward program
Hrm, not sure what troubles you had for production. Probably not that different tbh. What are some issues you encountered?
was going to say...Reddit has a public API available, and there are several different API clients available for using it...just write the damn thing.
That is called "Freezing". The term "compiling" means something else. The most popular right now seems to be pyinstaller. I haven't tried it but it claims to be 3.7 compatible. If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to include a specific question and some example code that demonstrates your problem. Any errors would help too. 
Okay, thank you. I wouldn't have thought "Freezing," I actually have never heard it called that before. I wasn't aware it had a name other than what makes everyone think I'm speaking C. Good to know.
Thank's I've just searched for Python on Reddit and this sub was the first one. I'll subscribe to r/learnpython.

I am surprised at the lack of mention of [Falcon](https://falconframework.org/) in this thread. I find it much quicker and easier to write APIs using it, it's easy to integrate with pytest, and it is *fast*.
More info: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/shipping/freezing/ You should note that unlike other ("compiled") languages, this is not something that python was designed to do. Python is designed for everyone to install python and have the .py files to be distributed.
Oh I get now, thanks for the reply. I’ll try this with some projects.

Yeah. You are right. Not pretty.
How are you calling `CheckAlive()`? When I run `python3 ./file.py`: def CheckAlive(): print('Controls: Checking [alive]') import configparser cp = configparser.ConfigParser() cp.read('State.ini') print(cp.sections()) alive = cp['health']['alive'] return alive if __name__ == '__main__': CheckAlive() with `State.ini` in the same directory I get Controls: Checking [alive] ['health'] If `State.ini` isn't in the same directory as you are running the python script you might need to use the absolute path, like /u/POTUS said.

I disagree. It has nothing to do with learning Python. is more related to the language and the tool surrounding language itself then it is to actually learning python. 
Thank you! I didn't allow it since I didn't know. I guess I'll have to go fix that. I do appreciate you taking the time to respond. 
Not really, I really like coding so it comes easier to me (Not saying I am really smart or don't have problems) I just don't need to learn it off as much.
I don't have them on Github, I have never used it before.
Thanks!
I will, just need something to come up in class for me so I can be inspired to do something.
Yeah, GUIs are the best, but for the clock TKinter was giving me nightmares with not working with the time module and I had to use .after.
What do you expect to happen if there are files called `filename.pdf` and `filename.doc` in the same folder? The extension is part of the name. You need to specify the full name, including the extension, when opening a file.
It felt so irrational, but at the same time I couldn't deny the shudder that passed through my body. 
Take a look at [XARs](https://github.com/facebookincubator/xar/blob/master/README.md).

Pass in '3d6' as a string and then parse it. 
Actually, [argv is a vector of C strings](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Program-Arguments.html), is the premise of your argument is wrong., And kwargs is a dictionary.
You need to ask this in r/learnpython and identify what you specifically need help with.
Ok but there's no way to enter only '3d6' instead of 'foo(3d6)'? Like a custom way of calling the function as 'xdy'

Lack of choice in async web / m-service frameworks certainly isn't an issue :) Being able to rely on the one you choose still being developed/supported in a years time is more the concern. A good write up here explaining ASGI and the frameworks that currently support it : [https://www.encode.io/articles/hello-asgi/](https://www.encode.io/articles/hello-asgi/) For me - Fastapi on top of starlette looks very promising, but it's also very new. &amp;#x200B;
Pyinstaller works, however, depending on what platform you freeze on, it will link to GPL violating libraries. I've heard "readline" on linux. 
A function should be an action (verb), by your nomenclature 3d6 describes an object or objects (a noun) so you want to do your reader a favor and tell them what you are doing. so roll("3d6") returns the results of rolling 3 6-sided dice while show("3d6") might play an animation of 3 6-sided dice being rolled.
Another thread for r/learnpython But, do you mean like... Python my.py --3 --6 Where the first argument is the number of dice and the second is number of sides?
Make a git hub, it is very valuable
Why those two specifically, and not, say, Flutter? 
If you're interested at all in developing software professionally, you'll want to learn it sooner than later. You'll need to look up "git", not just github. Github is just a free service that stores your git repositories for you. Essentially it's a tool that stores source code changes, so you can tag which set of changes are which version/release. Anywhere where there's professional software development, they use git or a tool like it.
defusedxml is effectively a preprocessor for parsing xml files that integrates with stdlib and popular xml libs. My guess is also that bandit incorrectly assumes your use of the xml lib constitutes parsing of xml files.
You can write a simple parser: import re from random import randint from typing import List def d(n: int) -&gt; int: return randint(1, max(1, n)) def nd(q: int, n: int) -&gt; List[int]: print(q, n) return [d(n) for _ in range(max(0, q))] def throw(dice: str) -&gt; List[int]: m = re.match(r"([1-9]\d*)[dD]([1-9]\d*)", dice) if not m: raise ValueError(f"Expected QdN, got: {dice}") q, n = map(int, m.groups()) if n % 2: raise ValueError(f"Invalid number of sides: {n}") return nd(q, n) def main(): while True: print(throw(input("Enter QdN: "))) if __name__ == "__main__": main() That allows your user to input "3d6" and get a result. If what you mean is can you write something like `3d6()` the no, because function names can't start with numbers, but you could do something like: def _3d6(): return nd(3, 6) It's a bit unclear which you're after.
Next version: color ASCII?
Purely out of curiosity--Are you using append_trace? I've seen a number of things saying it can be slow and that you are better off composing your own "data" dictionary in python then setting the figure's data to that. 
So there's no alternative ways to call functions? What if you wanted to type d3,6 in the console to call a function roll(3,6)? Def roll(num, sides): #generate num randints between 1 and 6. #return (r1, r2, r3, total) Is there some way to call this function by typing in the console: D3,6
In the name of microservices, I'm tremendously surprised at Falcon's low use. I've used it a couple times now and it'll be my go to for all microservice projects going forward.

No matter what I input it is coming out as December because that is my else in my translate\_month function. I need to be able to have days 1-31 = January, 32-59 = February and have it print that.
great write up. I've given fastapi a try and it looks really great. Super easy to get something up and running and I like how swagger ( and redoc ! ) just work out of the box. Except for flask\_restplus it's surprising how few of the many micro-frameworksframeworks have something like this. I'll be trying it out for a small utility project I'm working on.
I don't understand though why use the "walrus" operator, why not just use a single equal sign? The whole reason we use two equality signs for comparison was to distinguish from using a single equal sign to do assignment. That notation exists since at least C, and most likey it is older than that.
The mega tutorial is great. The flask tutorial is also pretty good to get you started. http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/

Awesome! 😁
I asked the question in a different comment, but in the mean time found the answer: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0572/#id32 It essentially says that it would be confusing. The whole operation is making things more confusing though, I suppose it is perhaps to make python complaining that you accidentally typed = when you meant == and I guess that's valid, but this syntax introduces a second way to do assignments and looks like having two ways to do assignment just places a wart on the language. I don't think the benefit it gives is worth it. 
What is up with the Midwest Rust Belt city Pycon tour? Yuck.
Probably because flutter requires learning and using dart, which is a very special snowflake language without much skill and knowledge portability. Python and C#, on the other hand, have magnitudes greater skill application possibilities.
No. I don't make sub charts.
Hi, excited to try using this as an end user. I know some very basic Python and hope to use it to streamline the management of my fantasy leagues. I notice one source of frustration for me is that players have different IDs across different sources (e.g. official NBA.com, Yahoo!, ESPN, etc.). Is support for different sources on the to-do list?
You should probably write it like this: while True: v = get_a_value if not v: break But yeah, the operator makes it more compact.
IDLE is shit
Thanks for all your work. I really enjoyed Automate The Boring Stuff With Python, I plan on buying another of your books soon. 
I still use 2.7 T_T
`filename` is a variable--not a literal filename. It can contain anything from a number to a None, True, False, or "file_containining_a_bunch_of_words.txt". So before readWordsInsideFile put a line like `filename = 'myfile.txt'`. Then create a file named "myfile.txt" and put some stuff in it. Program then works.
Nice job they look great! Can’t wait to see wht u do in the future :) be sure to share
I think he mixed it up, you can just do it like this: for chunk in iter(partial(file.read, 8192), b''): print(chunk) 
You lost me there--a chart typically has multiple "traces". A trace is simply dictionary of data that defines an element on a chart or figure. So each bar, line or set of points on **any** figure is a "trace". If you chart anything it includes "traces". My question is--Are you creating those dictionaries of data with python then telling plotly to draw them or are you telling plotly to draw data set 1, then draw data set 2, then data set 3, etc. It seems if you do the latter plotly ends up drawing data set 1, then drawing data set 1 and data set 2, then drawing data set 1, data 2, and data set 3. If you give it a complete dictionary of dictionary of your data then it simply draws data set 1, 2, and 3. So it doesn't draw data set 1 three times. 
Pensylvania's in the Midwest? When did that happen?
Same xD
`bush hid the facts` !
No. I don't use Plotly with Python. Using it at the front end with React. And in the front end, I append a few data under one array and then, I plot.

Fantastic! How did you learn Python/ how long did it take? 
Interesting, they bumped it back to April and over Easter weekend. Interesting change.
For anyone new to git, this article made it click instantly for me what all the various git commands do: https://rachelcarmena.github.io/2018/12/12/how-to-teach-git.html
Think of it as a mega dictionary of nested lists and dictionaries. You can parse through each one printing/storing the information you want using a for loop. I'm sure there are easier ways using dataframes and databases, and this approach takes a bit of work, but it'll go a long way in helping you understand how to read raw json outputs. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;

This comment is unconstructive but not wrong. IDLE is poor as an advanced IDE for the obvious reasons. It's equally poor as a basic IDE because with a language like Python, you're honestly better off with a straight up editor like Sublime, VSCode, Vim, or Emacs and docs.python.org. It's alright for only the most basic kinds of GUI development, but even then it really falls short with clearly limited support for Unicode, and this is a fundamental limitation of the actual underlying GUI library _of_ IDLE. Not having proper Unicode support in a widely-used application in 2019 is properly shameful and should immediately disqualify it as a development tool.
Doesn't crash 3.7.1 on macOS
It has to be a function, the REPL always parses input literally, so there is not any way I know of to just type D3, 6 and have it call a function 
Though alternatively, you could make a Infinite loop script that repeatedly ask for a dice, then rolls it and prints the result
&gt; with a language like Python, you're honestly better off with a &gt;straight up editor like Sublime, VSCode, Vim, or Emacs and &gt;docs.python.org Why? By definition an editor has less features and isn't integrated (the "I" in IDE). Come to think of it, it's not an environment either. 
What you can do is pre-create a number of variables: `1d6 = Roll(6,1)`, `2d6 = Roll(6, 2)` and so on. You then exploit the `__repr__` to do the actual roll: ``` class Roll: def roll(self): # whatever ... def __repr__(self): x = self.roll() return f'You rolled {x}' ``` This is obviously (I hope) a terrible idea and you should implement your own command line parser for this, instead of using the REPL directly. Good luck!
You can never call a function in the Python interpreter without actually calling it -- ie invoking it with parentheses in which arguments are optionally passed), so _no_ that's not directly possible. At minimum you'd need `d3(6)`, although that would be a waste of energy, as you'd need to define a d1, d2, up to dN, where N is the maximum number of dice you'd ever want to throw. Now what you _could_ do is create your own Domain Specific Language (DSL) and write an interpreter and REPL for that in Python.
Yeah if you can install terminal for VSCode, and I’m pretty sure for the others as well. You can also get Python extensions like a linter, etc. I use VSC over IDEs in my life, for any project.
If "hello world" is almost everything you need then yes, django has no advantages here. In this case flask or even bottle or cherryPy will be perfect for you. But as far as django is concerned, people think that it is a huge monolithic beast that eats resources when in reality it is not. You choose what to import and what to use.
Qt and C++ is what I would consider. Toga is bit immature yet, not to mention some of the other stuff. Possibly enough if you are doing one off though. I looked at it last month and while it was promising it was still definitely work in progress unlike Qt. 
could you be more specific ? I am looking forward to deploy apps on iOS and Android , thank you for your response.
Its time migrate!
Are you talking about python console or bash/windows console?
PyCharm community edition is free.
Hit your boy up I’m going 
Can't even test this on Linux, IDLE refuses to input emojis, both by pasting from this title or using iBus. Odd, but not unexpected.
Try creating the variable **1d6**... you can't, because variables can't start with numbers.
Because experience (from c amongst others) have taught us that this is very error prone, to the extent that almost every C compiler will warn by default when an assignment is used as a Boolean condition. And that is exactly why python’s `=` is an assignment in the first place. I make this error regularly myself and am quite grateful that pycharm and python catch it immediately. Using a separate operator which can’t be easily mistyped from an intended `==` mostly avoids that issue. 
What I was implying there (maybe too implicitly) that it's wiser for a _beginner_ to start with Python in an editor with just the official docs open. This is largely because: - The official docs pretty objectively document the standard library APIs better than IDLE (PyCharm might be fine these days, but I haven't used it in a while so I can't speak to that) - IDEs in generally should be avoided by beginners IMO because they do a _lot_ of heavy lifting for the developer. There's an argument to be made about this kind of automation hampering the learning experience. - The exception here are languages which are too heavy/rich to really be workable using an Editor. Most professional Java developers wouldn't be caught dead using a simple editor; a big chunk of Python developers _do_ use just a simple editor. Features aren't always what you want, especially when you're just picking a language up. And for the Pascal IDE, that's actually hilarious and pretty shameful. There's no excuse for the key bindings, but is there any runtime/language implementation constraint for the 255-char-long strings, or is that arbitrary in Pascal?
Qt has been around years. It has worked well. Toga doesn't really have active development on Android (half the widgets are missing), and even on desktop it is bit of hit and miss (limited set of widgets that some work, some do not, quite). If you want to develop app instead of (helping) develop framework, Toga isn't really for you.
Checkout Kivy for crossplatform mobile app Python development. It's been in the ecosystem for quite a while, tho I haven't had anything more than several demo apps made to play around
Honestly, just rewrite it in C or Rust or whatever. Python is not a fast language, especially CPython.
when I checked out kivy , it didn't really looked that good including the UI , apparently I think it suits best for a demo or some games perhaps, do correct me if I am wrong.
I missed this reply but thanks for this, I'm going to look into it, seems like another promising one!
If you're keen to use stuff that is in the works, try https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/ - I am looking at it now out of curiosity. Not sure if I go with Qt 5 or PSG with my next project though.
I dont know C or Rust and what to keep it in python. :)
but can the app be deployed on mobile platform? that is the main concern, I am sorry but I am bit new to mobile-development scenario , perhaps even GUI development.
Then you're stuck with how fast CPython can go. If you have the option, you can try PyPy, but it will probably be slower, since most of the things you're doing will be CPython compatible API calls.
What do you mean by "symlinks on Windows"? NTFS junction points?
Probably not very easily. That library supports web ui which you can embed on device but it probably requires you to figure out on your own how, and on each platform. I would again recommend Qt as it just works and is mature and relatively efficient. ( C++ I have used on few mobile projects )
&gt;Delphi Holy hell, why would you pay for that?
Thank You, will look into Qt.
Have you been to Western PA? It's basically the Midwest.

Cleveland is a great city to visit for a conference. It was good last year and I'm looking forward to it again this year.
Have you tried running and optimizing on a different implementation like PyPy? I’ve seen decent performance improvement on data processing with a reasonable number of code paths using PyPy.
If you're wanting Android, I'd like to recommend enaml-native.
Ah, I totally forgot that little detail. I guess you would need some prefix then. More reasons why this is a terrible idea :D
I have a file which is a symbolic link file. It points to the original file placed in some other directory.. Original file is at D:\\Xproject\\mayafile\\test.ma \-&gt; here file type is Maya ascii Symbolic link is at D:\\Xproject\\test.ma \-&gt; here file type is .symlink I want to use this symbolic link file and get the path of the original file in windows 10 using python
Ignore the haters; Python can be slow compared to other languages, but I can totally understand that you like it for all its benefits. It’s hard to be very specific without knowing more about your exact implementation, but in general there are ways to speed up your Python. The first way is vectorisation. Instead of looping through lists, use NumPy arrays. These allow you to do more complex operations much quicker. Another way could be to use Cython. This is a neat tool, as it allows you to simply write Python code, but pre-compile it to make it run a bit quicker. In addition, you could opt for further optimisation through some static typing (note that while Cython allows for this, this requires non-standard Python syntax). Pre-compiled Cython modules can be imported into Python like any other. Finally, if you’re doing stuff that requires image processing, have a look at OpenCV. There are Python bindings, and they offer pretty quick methods for a lot of computer vision tools. In sum, vectorise where possible throughout your code, and think about potentially writing your most time-consuming functions into Cython modules.

Isn't python known to be slow? Like, measured in minutes to complete what other languages do in seconds kind of slow? Python is kinda like Baymax. Powerful, adaptable, but fast? [Nooooot so much. ](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/98/54/4d/98544df4e69eeabf3b94c4acd66cf6b4.gif)
I guess the "it'll alternate between east coast and west coast" concept is dead.
I'm at risk of sounding stupid here, but do Billboard really not have an API for this?
Not really sure what you mean. It provides means to build the UI
Unfortunately, not all code is new code, and even more unfortunatelyer, not all new code uses a stack that makes the most sense in 2019. The Delphi ecosystem is probably about as rich as you'd imagine these days, so I'm guessing the tooling developers don't have to clear a whole lot of high bars in terms of features per dollar.
We need a New Orleans PyCon in 2022, 2023 
We are already doing that to some extend in our bot and are really fast on distance calculation now with scipy and numpy :) The only thing that takes some time is the creation of the arrays in every frame.
compared to Portland is was much cleaner also. 
PHP, Javascript - the languages that were considered bad by most for a long time have made huge improvement over the last few years that they are now seen as **modern**. Python is trying to catch up with optional type and async but is still nowhere near how good they are in these languages. I hope people going to the conference will discuss the future of the language itself instead of just showcasing what cool stuff you can make with Python. I hope Python is more than a glue language.
Still gonna have to do at least `2 x d(6)`, because ultimately whatever is on the right of that is going to have to be an instance of a class that does that overloading of `__mul__` (and probably `__rmul__` as well).
I would really like to, but pypy is on python 3.5.3 and I use 3.6. I dont know if I can go down because the bot relies on other stuff too that might not be available in 3.5.3. (I wish everyone was using the most recent version of python...) Do you know something that is on 3.6? I can not go to 3.7 either because the cpp implementation of python protobuf is not done.
I've never been so confused with computers in all my life.
There are things that speed up python and i dont know them, this post is to maybe find them :)
Read the sidebar. This is not a support forum. Post your question to r/learnpython but try to be less aggravating. Also post all of the code, or a link to it. The snippet you posted is incomplete, it does nothing useful by itself.
Have you considered using something like [Cython](https://cython.org/)?
I've learned more from you in ten seconds than reading non stop for a ridiculous amount of hours. thanks man. Im just beat at this point its like 4 am and im super irritated i havent figured this out yet.
If you can live with constructing each dice type as a variable, then you should be fine: \`d6 = Dice(6)\`, \`d10 = Dice(10)\`, etc. with the \`Dice\` class implementing \`\_\_mul\_\_\` and \`\_\_rmul\_\_\`. I mean this is all quite stupid, but at least solving stupid problems can be fun as well sometimes :)
I am confused, what doesn't work ? The call to the function, the starting of the script ? What error msg do you get ? Need a bit more insight, also sleep tends to give you a fresh insight 
 You'll have to excuse my complete ignorance about this stuff I have zero clue. I can't even get the script to execute in python/ 
To come at it from another angle, you're probably trying to calculate more information than you need to be able to make a decision if your bot can't keep up. Cython should be a speed bump for you, but the main thing to do is minimize looping and especially nested looping. I see you referring to a lot of arrays and frankly it sounds like you're trying to do a lot of measurements on the objects in those arrays. Starcraft is not a game that's solvable in that way. There's too much stuff flying around.
??? what a random question, there’s so many methods out there. any use-case in particular? also post this to r/LearnPython instead
use pathib, feed the Path object your symlink file and call resolve on it and it should return the actual path if I am not mistaken.
This. Especially if you use the types you can really speed up loops. (We are talking &gt;100x speedup) See http://nealhughes.net/cython1/
Welcome address by Vladimir Putin
Amen to that.
Yes, we are doing that also. We just ran out of things to cut and trying to get other speed ups, not only be reducing the amount of calculations.
Yes, we are still figuring out where we can subsitute parts of the current code with cython code.
In that case Cython should be your fastest compiler. Have you done any profiling?
Which is why flask comes with many great extensions so you can add what you need
Can't you pool or re-use those arrays?

Thanks for trying it out! The goal of the application at this point is to provide shades that would help you to emulate one that you like on another face e.g. ‘I really like that shade of pink. How could I match that?’ The next step is providing tailoured suggestions for a face. That is a more difficult problem as it requires accounting for hair, skin, and possibly eye colour.

The "as" syntax is ambiguous. That was discussed to death about fifty thousand times through three threads on two mailing lists and the PEP. Using "as" for this is a fucking zombie proposal -- no matter how many times you shoot it down, the damn thing just won't die.
If you’re using doing matrix math you should look at Numba: https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/user/overview.html It can compile NumPy operations down to machine code for speedup. All it requires is an import and some annotations. Supports Python 3.5+ too. It may help you out!

Well, I have my eyes open when coding and can tell apart = and ==. Never had this issue with C/C++. I wonder if people who love this argument mistake + for - too.
It will work fine if you have a file called "filename" **with no file extension**. If you give it a file extension, then naturally you need to supply the file extension when you try to open it. 
Perfect Placement.
Its a joke.
We already did that for our distance calculation and it wasnt faster than what we already had with numpy+scipy. Thanks anyways :)
No, we dont know what changes in the next frame. Basically any unit, building, mineral on the map might change at any time. 
There are tons of resources on r/learnmachinelearning
Install Anaconda IDE for easiness in making different environments with different libraries. Then learn some web scraping using bs4, requests, selenium (this one only for small stuff because it's for autoation and not really big scraping), etc. Fiddle with data using pandas and learn to plot it using matplotlib. After learning all this, *only* then jump to ml algorithms and analysis part. Or else you'll have a hard time understanding basic things. Now your work is to look up videos on youtube about the topics above and start *making* stuff instead of just watching or reading books on it.

I bet dollars to donuts that the OP has completely misunderstood what was said, and is conflating the tutor's comments about not needing to specify the full path provided the file is in the current working directory with the separate fact that the file has no extension. I reckon what the tutor said was something like "You don't need a file extension on filenames. And when you open a file, you don't need to provide the full path so long as the file in in the current working directory" and the OP mixed the two separate ideas together and got "you don't need to use the file extension if the file is in the current working directory".
Did you read the code snippet? I guess not.

Looks like [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15556147/pypi-is-slow-how-do-i-run-my-own-server) has a couple workarounds in the question, and explains how to setup a cache if you are frequently spawning clean rebuilds.

Yeah, it's an interesting example of how unicode support in a language may not reflect unicode support in the editor.

Hi. I think coursera course on machine learning is good for start! Teacher is Andrew NG, a famous man in silicon valley 😉 Here is the course link: https://www.coursera.org/learn/machin-learning
I'm also new so I don't have anything to say about the code itself but I want to say kudos for actually introducing yourself to github so early in your learning. 
Free for hobbyists though.
great ressource !
&gt; I dont know if I can go down because the bot relies on other stuff too that might not be available in 3.5.3. It's worth finding out 
Yeah, even just getting away from re-creating arrays on every frame seems like a possible route.
Did you try different pypi mirror?
Thanks, will check your link!
Thanks. I started using it because I figured it would help me keep track of my projects/make sure I don’t lose it because I forgot to save it lol.
I wanted to, but somehow could not find the list of mirrors. Could you point me to the right resource if you know it? That'd be really helpful!
IDLE lacks even the most basic feature of a code editor, namely line numbering.
Did you link the right article? Neither "Pythonic" nor "Virginia" appear in the text of this piece
I find udemy courses quite helpful when learning new skills/ language. I did https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/ After creating an account they usually offer significant discounts.
From the article, near the top: "There are often multiple ways to complete common tasks..." Though perhaps you don't know what "Pythonic" means.
Excellent article. I agree that pandas is unnecessarily complex because it is not pythonic. Pandas had a Perl like ecosystem where having multiple ways to do things makes it hard to use from memory and really hard to read other people's code. Maybe we need an an abstraction layer on top of pandas that implements this advice?
BeeWare founder here. BeeWare is still in the very early stages of development. The current development version is v0.3, and the experience you're going to have reflects a product with that level of maturity. It's reasonably reliable for simple tasks on macOS, OK on Linux, passable on iOS; but Windows is lagging, and the Android backend is currently in a broken state. If you're looking for a "pick it up and use it" user experience, sadly, BeeWare isn't there yet. We *want* to get there, but we're not there right now. If you're using learning to program, or learning to develop UI code, the quirks of BeeWare are probably going to be more hassle than they're worth. That's especially the case if you're planning to target mobile - the experience on Android is *very* far behind at the moment. However, if you're adventurous, you've don't need something that works *right now*, and you're willing to roll up your sleeves and debug problems as they spring up, then *maybe* BeeWare is worth considering. As for an alternative - I don't know if I have any good recommendations. In my opinion, cross platform mobile (that isn't "game" focused) isn't a space that has *good* answers at the moment. Xamarin, Qt and Kivy are all possibilities, but it very much depends on what languages you know, what platforms you want to support, and what user experience you want the end application to have. The other option comes from questioning your original requirements: Do you *really* need your app to be cross platform? If not - then writing in Swift to produce an iOS app, or Kotlin to produce an Android app, will be a lot easier. You'll be using the native platform the way it wants to be written, it will be easier to find documentation and examples, and your development experience will be a lot smoother.
https://www.coursera.org/learn/learn-to-program is a pretty nice course for absolute beginners. They teach the basics but also instill some good practices. There are also the Learn Python the Hard Way, and Automate the Boring Stuff books. Both are good if that is more your learning style.
i would prefer youtube videos more rather than coursera udemy stuff..any good playlist/youtube channel you know of?
Thank you for the response Mr.Russell , it's an honor to get a response from founder himself, well the reason I am not jumping to swift is because I do not own a mac to utilize the Xcode , and Kotlin serves to Android only , I picked the BeeWare because the whole thing looked amazing where one code serves all (although perhaps still in early stages). will definitely consider one of your suggestions (i.e. Qt) as a student looking forward for the bright future of PyBee and thank you for your amazing contribution to Open Source.

The extension for editing remote files won me over, pretty handy for using the hpc cluster at my work. Afaik Pycharm would require the paid version to do the same thing
OK. From the post title it sounded like you were linking an article that you disagreed wit
Personally I found that you could take all the classes in the world and not have a good grasp until you have a project to work on. There's a good website I direct people to that my old professor still has up. It's mostly based in astronomy but it gives you some good coding skills: https://sites.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/krumholz/teaching-and-courses/python-15
TIL Delphi is still around.
And for students even the Pro is free (as well as all other Jetbrains Pro Versions)
&gt; By definition an editor has less features and isn't integrated (the "I" in IDE) Well, let's be honest: modern text editors are as complex as IDEs, but have shoved that complexity off to extensions, allowing the editor to be tool agnostic, but with extensions to provide the integration. You want graphical breakpoints and one-click access to build chains? Your text editor can have that feature. Personally, I have to admit that I've gotten faster about it in the terminal. I just wish I understood `gdb` better, because so often my attempts to print variables after breaking give me an "optimized out" message. That's C, which, y'know, does weird things when compiling.
&gt; Though perhaps you don't know what "Pythonic" means. Do you? Does anyone? Because no one seems to agree on what the definition of "pythonic" is. It's a shitty term that should be purged from the collective lexicon. Python has a collection of idioms that are intended to make your code more easily readable and maintainable by other Python developers. **These idioms are not laws. ** Slavish devotion to them is just as stupid as haphazardly coding without any kind of plan or structure. Having multiple ways to accomplish the same task is not *ipso facto* bad design. There are plenty of examples of this is baseline python - e.g. using os.path vs pathlib. Which one of those choices is "obviously" correct? Pandas is a large, sprawling, complicated library. It probably could do with a refresh. Dismissing it as "not pythonic" is just stupid. That designation doesn't accomplish anything. It's just another thing for people to argue about. This blog post would have been better served written in the style of "Pandas is very complicated. Here's the best subset of tools to accomplish most things in Pandas." Python *is* a great language. Pythonistas are often insufferable and the Cult of the Pythonic needs to goddamn die. 
&gt; Though perhaps you don't know what "Pythonic" means. At this point, nobody really does anymore. It seems to mean different things to different people, and I haven't really found a useful definition yet, not beyond "idiomatic Python" anyway. You'll often see people quote `import this`, but unfortunately, half of the Zen Of Python is self-contradictory, and the other half is so vague that it doesn't even mean anything, and much of it is violated by pretty much all the Python code out there, and even the language itself, all the time. Personally, I believe it'd be best to just stop using the word and say what we really mean.
But can you at least re-use the allocated memory?

https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning
Using C, I had "optimized out" messages whenever I tried to print the value of a variable that was in scope but hadn't been initialized yet.
i agree Andrew is great, maybe you right, ill will start with him 
I really like Sentdex and Data School
No.
Try to google pypi mirror and name\_of\_your\_country as keywords.
Pythonic is what Guido says, obviously. My favourite abuse of this term is insisting on not checking the type. Because duck typing is ”pythonic”. That’s just nonsense. 
Socratica. So far it's the best YouTube python I've seen.
Good.
depends on your location but pypi is on CDN. Do you know if downloading is slow or the index? If you could pinpoint the problem it would help debugging
read the sidebar.
How's what it's doing now any different to using a colour picker on the lips and cross-referencing that colour against lipstick colours? &amp;#x200B; I read your description as being it'd recommend colours that suited that face but that's not really what it's doing.
i seriously agree with you,i have programming experience in JAVA as i had it in my undergrad
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar.
they are not using python in the course, but some different tools
Oh nice, I don't have any experience in Java but once you know a language it's pretty easy to pick up the other ones. Python is obviously a good choice. I know it's not a video but I highly suggest going through that site. It helped me a lot and still does
Ah it looks like either Cython or reorganizing your code are the next options as mentioned by other posters. I ran into a similar problem as you when doing some computer vision processing in Python for a project of mine ([project](http://lips.kyleingraham.com/), [blog](https://blog.kyleingraham.com/2018/11/28/lip-colour-finder/), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/aol3w9/lip_colour_finder_lipstick_recommendations/)). I had to reduce the sizes of the matrices I was working on (crop images to relevant features only) and test different libraries. I initially used scikit-image for most processing but moved to OpenCV for operations that were proving to be slowest after profiling. After essentially rewriting my compute path I almost halved my processing time. I also agree that NumPy is pretty fast. Operations that I performed using purely NumPy were never the holdup due to its underpinnings being largely in C.
where do i start with in it.
Never buy an udemy course for more then 20 bucks. They have large discounts all the time. The 200 price tag is a joke. Udemy courses are pretty good and it's how I have started learning python
When I typed into mine, it turns into something like this len("[p][p]") and returns 1
They are using Matlab or Octave (I think) which are languages designed for doing math and linear algebra. If you are interested in the theory and how machine Learning works, it makes sense since it's easier to do machine learning in those languages than in Python. Unless you are hard set on learning it with Python, I very highly recommend the course. Fantastic professor.
Smiles can't be measured
A classic starting point for python https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html
thank you, worth to mention
I'd rather have a useful library than a Pythonic library. As someone who uses Pandas daily for my job, I think many of the author's complaints in this article are silly and trivial. 
Thanks for taking a look! You can use a colour picker but the problem you will run into is getting enough pixels from the lips to generate a good estimate of the lipstick colour. If you select a single pixel you will run into problems because at the pixel level colour values can vary quite a bit in a seemingly homogeneously coloured area. Taking in a wider area helps but then you run into pixels from the face's skin polluting your lip colour estimate. Thus you need to remove the influence of the face's skin from your estimate as well. The processing also needs to be robust enough to generalize across many different facial orientations, skin colours, and degrees of mouth openings. Teeth also need to be accounted for because they pollute the estimate as well (facial landmark estimation can include them with the lips). I supposed you could give the user a colour picker and let them have at it but in most cases the processing is so fast that giving them the convenience of automation is inexpensive once you've nailed the processing.
I used SOLOLEARN to learn by myself, but my school teaches it too, Now I usually stick to online articles or documentation because I use modules alot more then the main code. I cannot accurately say how long it took.
Anything by Jose Portilla on Udemy will be good for beginners. If you are okay with R, an In Depth Introduction to Statistical Learning is a great free but course.
Udemy is cool and all but there's just so much quality content for free else where. The discounts are pretty much a lie. Every time I've looked at udemy they are priced at $100 plus but discounted to $20 or something. They just want you to think it's a good deal. 
Excellent article!
Yeah, the question is always whether and how i can substitute something with numpy
It is understood that an experienced developer of old systems like Delphi or Fortran can command high salaries, just for the sake of being able to support the old systems that rely on them. I myself know several of the ancient tongues, but I keep my career progressing along with technology because that old shit is fucking terrible to work with. I'm glad some people are still around to handle it, but I'm even more glad it doesn't have to be me.
The line between "editor" and "IDE" has blurred. Is VSCode an IDE or editor? Or Vim? Or Emacs? They can all do code linting, introspection, debugging, compiling where applicable, in short they are all integrated. And of course each one is an environment. Notepad is an editor. Most everything else, when properly configured, can be an IDE.
This course came out several years ago before many of today’s tools became the go-to tools for ML. In his Deep Learning specialization courses, it’s all Python, TensorFlow, Jupyter notebooks, etc.

Absolutely this.... 100%
&gt; is there any runtime/language implementation constraint for the 255-char-long strings, or is that arbitrary in the IDE? As the other poster said, Delphi is based on Borland Pascal for DOS from the 80s. Back then we didn't have unicode, so strings were just one byte per char. Pascal strings, instead of being null-terminated like c, had a length byte in position zero. So strings were limited to 256 characters in length. 16-bit Delphi 1, released in 1995, shared this limitation. The very next major version release was 32-bit and removed the string length limitation. So since the 90s Delphi has supported long strings. It's been many years since I've touched Delphi so I can't say for sure, but I have my doubts that it still has that old limitation baked into the IDE. I wouldn't bet too much on it though.

As i recall (disclaimer: years since used Python) 2.7 `xrange` became 3.x `range`, because more efficient. 
In python2 range returns a list, while in python3 range became 2’s xrange and returns a generator.

I liked the Udemy a-z hands on artificial neural networks. I could not wrap my head around NNs but these guys explained them well, and then got into the code. I have since made several models.
Nice and short way to hold the data. Some tips, avoid the global variables and store the game state as data you pass to your game. Maybe encapsulate the game as a class to hold this. 
The old **range** builtin always returned a **list**. When iterating over very large ranges this is incredibly inefficient, which is why **xrange** was also available in Python 2. In Python 3 the old **range** was tossed out and **xrange** became **range**. Since you could always think of **range** in Python 2 as just: def range(*args): return list(xrange(*args)) You can trivially get the old behavior of `x = range(21)` by changing it to `x = list(range(21))`. But most of the time you'll be iterating over a **range** and doing something with each individual value... it makes no sense to build the entire list into memory first only to then iterate over each value and then toss the list you just built. Hence the change.
PHP is now modern? Wat?
I use [pip2pi](https://github.com/wolever/pip2pi/) for my own personal pypi little mirror, works great.
[removed]
A little nitpick on an otherwise good answer: although a lot of people now refer to range in Python3 as a generator, it is actually more accurate to say it's a 'lazy iterable' in which the sequence doesn't take up memory and answers questions computationally. A few ways to know it isn't a generator or iterator is that you can't call 'next' on a range and that it allows indexing (e.g. range(30)[2]), which isn't possible in generators/iterators
Shit probably should be in r/learnpython???
No. You can vomit all over the place, including yourself, and people will still downvote you.
Start here: [https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/optimize.html](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/optimize.html) &amp;#x200B; You can define a function with input variables which will be minimized, as well as a constraint function, which inputs the same variables. &amp;#x200B; To get the minimizer to maximize, simply add a " - " in front of the return statement. It's quite easy to get going and you can do w/e you want inside the function. 
Ever heard of PHP 7? 
Typing a char on the swiss keyboard crash(ed?) it instantly 5 years ago. Imagine just typing, hen your editor crashes when you accidently hit a key... That was when I switched to atom. I am not great at making decisions lol.
IDLE is awful

Some times unicode in html grts fucked up as hell 
Thanks for your thoughts on that. I'll open a ticket on the bandit project and see what they say.
This is a great question and I am curious to hear what pros will say. I am very similar in that I have a non CS background and quite frankly finding this information about programming rules, such as using global variables correctly, or how to make complex classes, etc is really hard. I guess you could start by signing up for the intro to programming with python MIT course on EdX for free! That has helped me learn more about the "essentials" and might give you some talking points.
It's super effective!
It's out of my control, but it's in the process.
My initial idea is to get the Cracking the Coding Interview book from the local library, but it's a pretty big book and I'm not sure if that is the best route. I also have trouble with classes. It's mostly due to lack of practice I guess. For all my my applications, all I had to do was implement a bunch of functions that transformed data into whatever I needed it to be followed by the regular Pandas data cleanup and visualization. 
OP also mentioned he's using Maya, which is a DCC software. You can see the status of Python 3 in DCC software at [http://www.vfxplatform.com/#footnote-python3](http://www.vfxplatform.com/#footnote-python3). It's no somewhere soon. It'll take next 3-4 to be implemented in Animation pipelines.

why not download the wheel files and install them then?
It is gcc, and honestly, the problem probably is in the makefiles not doing what I think they're supposed to. I didn't write them, and they have some weird surprises. My big success this week was finally getting a new library to link successfully without the makefiles throwing a massive fit.
Do you, by chance, got a link for that?
you can do the coursework and submit the assignments in python too - https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments

They’re actually not the same. It’s closer, but not quite.
There is more than one Easter? We can't get a national day to vote but we have two Easters?
http://course.fast.ai The old version of their course and the corresponding library was a bit buggy and difficult to use but I'm liking the new version that's come out a few weeks ago, and it's gotten a lot easier to install as well: ``` conda install -c pytorch -d fastai fastai ``` This course is best if you want to start building ML models right away rather than spending a lot of time learning the theory (but I recommend eventually learning the theory which pretty much most of the other courses recommended here will do a great job at.) 
Can people please stop recommending the Andrew Ng ML course? For one thing, it's in Octave and not Python, and after going through the course, which takes like 2-3 months, you will have a basic understanding of theory but you will not actually be able to grab a data set and make a machine learning model on it. There are dozens of courses that go over the same concepts but in Python. The only thing special about it is it was one of the first MOOC's, so everyone always points to it. With a course like [Applied Machine Learning in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-machine-learning), you get a quick 4 week course, you'll go over the basics of ML and build models in scikit-learn, which is one of the more popular Python ML frameworks. After that, you'll be able to grab datasets from anywhere and have a foundation on how to create a prediction model from them, all using python.
You won't need much knowledge of octave/matlab for the course since you will just use a few math operations. And in my opinion this is the best ML intro course available, it's totally worth it.

Thank you, I learned something.
In python everything is an object, even imported modules. Therefore you can use them to store data. &gt;&gt;&gt; import matplotlib.pyplot as plt &gt;&gt;&gt; plt.life_meaning = 42 &gt;&gt;&gt; print(plt.life_meaning) 42 
One of the thing I don't like about this course is that author is using his own library.
Im in the andrew ng course and we covered 2 algorithms so far and i know how to apply the algorithm to a dataset immediately by looking at the formula.
&gt; The Utf8 branch, which changes the internal representation of unicode might be finally merged at some point very soon. We discussed and improved upon the last few blockers. It gives significant speedups in a lot of cases handling strings. Oh, I can't wait. For my work, there's no point in running pypy3 with string performance so slow. Also, what's the status of type hints in the 3.6 branch? 
Has anyone heard updates on when pypy3 for windows will leave beta?
Have you taken a look at [Nuitka](http://nuitka.net/)? I guess you would need to compile the whole application with it, but it should speed the thing up dramatically 
as [kigurai](https://www.reddit.com/user/kigurai) mentioned, you can use Dice objects with \_\_mul\_\_ ( multiplication operator) overridden to do what you want, then run the script with -i &gt;python -i [file.py](https://file.py) &gt; &gt;( use py instead of python for windows ) you can then do this: &gt;\&gt;&gt;&gt; d6\*7 &gt; &gt;6d7: &gt; &gt; rolls: 4, 6, 2, 4, 2, 5, 6 &gt; &gt; total: 29 here is the code: [https://gist.github.com/11d998ee3eff6d22aa4502807c742bef](https://gist.github.com/11d998ee3eff6d22aa4502807c742bef)
Only kind of. It’s a very thin layer on top of pytorch, and you’re going to want most of the things it does anyway. Really, the course teaches you to use pytorch, but by being useful right from the start. I started in machine learning writing hand built sigmoid based neural networks on MPI architectures over 20 years ago, and I wish this kind of course and technology had been around back then. I somewhat agree with JH’s philosophy of being useful immediately and not getting too bogged down with theory.

Py 2 exe supports 3.7
in "PS" I've tried to summarize all the given recommendations.
Totally understand what you mean. I meant that people who develop tooling _for_ developers of those languages -- IDEs, compilers, static analyzers -- can charge through the nose themselves because it's a small market with little competition.
Line numbers are for BASIC developers who have to `GOTO 10` ;) In seriousness, I actually forgot about that.
Check out some of the courses we have on edX including ones from Harvard, Columbia, Microsoft, and more: [https://www.edx.org/learn/machine-learning](https://www.edx.org/learn/machine-learning) &amp;#x200B; Hope that helps, Josh from edX
So I have a similar problem for a program I’m just starting. Similar to your in which python would look into a directory and figure if new files have arrived and when they have finished copying. In my case I want it to be stupid for the user, where they can just drop files into a directory then magically sometime later my program does its thing. My first idea was to have python poll the sizes of the files using os.stat periodically and when they have stopped growing, after a certain amount of time, it would start working on them. Apparently this is somewhat hazardous, but I might add in some other logic. In your case you might want to add a bit to your web interface, that alerts your server side python that it has finished. Even just a lock file, or a separate text file of some sort would be fine. This would prevent your program from working on a file before it was finished uploading. As for load levelers and all that- multiprocessing queue will be very helpful I assume, for communication between the processes.
As far as book recommendations: Deep Learning with Python (Chollet) - Keras API &amp;#x200B; For scikit-learn, check out Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems (Geron) . This book uses TensorFlow 1.0 which is already dated. Maybe you can find it discounted :) &amp;#x200B;
Do you want to solve it in general case (such as, number of objects can be huge, number of goal objects can be an arbitrary number), or is it almost always 2 objects out of less then 10 items? If latter, I don't even think it's worth any optimization of a proper algorythm - just sort by points and one nested loop until you get a combination that fits your constraint. It should be really fast.
Hell, I just done it by hand, using python as a shell. It ain't that bad.
I will try to look through the docs again. Unfortunately, I have never deployed a Flask app. Dash would be perfect for me to present and share results within a company.
Pillow (PIL) is fairly defacto image library. Pip3 install pillow.
Oh lol I didn’t read. Apologies. I thought you were using python3.

Haven't personally tried it, but it's on my list. If you have a go at it, do let me know how it is https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120
Oh thanks!
Nah, that’s useless. To make use of line numbers (and you need those for tracebacks and stuff), they should be displayed next to code, so you can easily go between lines. IDLE has a “Go to line” dialog, but that can often be slower if you’re jumping a lot.
First, you need to uninstall Python. Then download and install Python 3.7
No problem sir,noted.
You didn’t visit Cleveland, you visited a tiny, downtown, built-for-tourists Cleveland.

Learning theory should always come before application. 
I traveled a bit to the surrounding areas like Lakewood, Tremont, and Cuyahoga Valley National Park. That was nice too. Where should (or shouldn't) I check out next time?
i haven't checked v3 of this course (I'll definitely do) but it was a bit annoying for me that it was more focused on winning kaggele competition rather then showing a real value
`pip3 install pillow` is run from the system prompt, not within Python itself.
i don't get your question. so is your question is asking how to send [xxx.py](https://xxx.py) file using email? or asking running the python3 code with python2 interpreter?
That is a [Linear Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming). I would recommend using [PuLP](https://pythonhosted.org/PuLP/) to write and solve those. I have used PuLP in the past and it works great.

You can just send them the .py file. They will be able to open it and read it. It will just throw syntax errors when it tries to run any python 3 specific code. 
It’s better to refresh the knowledge you already have. And get a good rest before the interview! It’s hard to learn something new in 2 weeks. It’s better to just read a bit about the company and the technologies listed in the job description, if you’re not familiar with them. Read just enough to get some basic understanding and to be able to ask the interviewer how they use the technologies and how you’re supposed to use them. Also since any interview is a lottery, they may not hire you even if you 100% fit. In any case use the interview to better understand what are the requirements, what questions are usually asked, and what gaps you may have. And don’t hesitate to ask questions if you don’t know something. Most interviewers like to explain things, and your willing to learn will be a plus for them 
I used two main resources to start in ML: 1. Book: [Machine learning a probabilistic perspective](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Probabilistic-Perspective-Computation/dp/0262018020) 2. Course: ["Foundations of Machine Learning" by Bloomberg](https://bloomberg.github.io/foml/#about) Both are quite math-heavy but it gave me a very solid basis to start building on. For learning Tensorflow I used examples and the documentation. 
This is great advice. Thank you! Also, being new to all this, I don't understand what you mean by the interview being a lottery? I was always under the impression that they intervew a bunch of candidates and pick the one that best meets their requirements (as demonstrated through skill and how they gel with the team during the on-site process). Could you elaborate a bit so that I can understand the process better? 
Why is type hints blocking at all? The code should still work. Mypy works fine on standard python code, even on python 2.7 (if done right).
All the pretty white places. I lived in Cleveland for a long time. One of the few cities in the nation to have a *declining* population. High crime. A shitty, segregated inner city. Look—Pycon is a self selected, mostly white contingent in a convention bubble. I get it.
Well I know that's not true because I took the course like 6 or so years ago when it came out, and you don't even go over splitting datasets into training/testing until 6 weeks in, and the first 2 algorithms you learn are linear regression on 1 variable(useless) and linear regression with multiple variables, where all of the code is given to you except for a couple lines where you fill it in yourself. Want to prove me wrong? How about you make a regression analysis of this dataset, (https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci), and share the notebook. Someone who took the class I suggested would be able to copy the code from the first example and come up with something within 30min to an hour of starting the class.
Sorry for wasting your time... im not a python wizarf. But Im sure the actual wizards can help you if you translate your comments to english. Good luck.

From my life experience, it's the other way around. If you learn theory but don't have the foggiest clue about the application, you tend to forget everything the day after you learn it (see 99% of high school calculus students). Also, it's not really "Pythonic". That would be like someone coming on here saying they want to learn to code in Python, so they get pointed to KnR and are told to learn C first so they can really understand where Python is coming from. That would be insane. Why do we think that it's acceptable for someone to learn ML in Python this way?
Out of curiosity, what kind of background did you have when you started the course?
I think you need to decide or describe how you want to alert the daemon that there's a task to start. For example, do you have a web server/framework that receives task start commands? Are you triggering off files being written to disk? Are the files being uploaded using http or something else (ftp, scp, or something else)? 
In addition to what everyone has mentioned you may want to look at how you’ve implemented your bot and document what the min requirements are. For example you mention that a lot of time is being spent updating the state of the units. How often are you updating them and how often do you really need to update them? How much information changes between frames? Could you work with every 3rd frame rather then every frame. Can you split the updates so slow manufacturing units only get updated every 5th frame but Moble units get every 2 frames. Do you need the accuracy that your calculating? You see this a lot in real life. For example your vision. You pick up a lot of information about your surroundings but you focus on one thing. If something happens in your low vision peripheral vision you switch focus. Your probably collecting a lot of data that you don’t need or that you can rotate your focus through. 
Using comments for type hints isn't as smooth as using python syntax. For example, pylint doesn't parse the comments, and will report unused imports. Also: the comment syntax can't do multiline (last time I tried), and if you adhere to the pep8 mandated 79 characters, it often just won't fit. There's ways to work around it, but not having to work around it really leads to cleaner code.
Look into compiling python code to an executable. 
Try /r/learnpython Or, you know, try harder to do your homework yourself.
I had just finished a BS in Mathematics, a little bit of Python. 
As another poster noted, what you have is a linear programming (or linear optimization) problem. Scipy has a function to solve that for you (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.linprog.html#scipy.optimize.linprog) You'll find that most of your difficulty will be in setting up your constraints, depending on your comfort with linear algebra. 
A machine learning AI might be feasible in Python, using the GPU for computation and utilising the various machine learning libraries. If you're doing a conventional AI, you're CPU-bounded for calculations and I'm going to recommend a different language. I know you said you want to do it in Python, but sometimes it's better to buy a car than to train a horse to run faster.
Codebasics on YouTube is better than Coursera or Andrew Ng or sendtex in my opinion. 
Wow, didn't expect to see them visiting the Landschaftspark in my hometown when I clicked on this. Neat.
This is how I did it: from turtle import * reset() tur = Turtle() tur.speed(0) tur.penup() tur.goto(0, 0) tur.pendown() pnt = Turtle() pnt.hideturtle() pnt.speed(0) pnt.penup() pnt.goto(0, 0) pnt.pendown() count = 0 coords = [[0,0]] # put both coords in the same list, not two different lists and initialise with start point at (0, 0) def onclick(x, y): tur.goto(x, y) coords.append([x, y]) tur.dot(5) # add the mirror code write in the function directly pnt.goto(x, -y) # flipped/negative y -&gt; flipped on x axis pnt.dot(5) global count count += 1 # equivalent to count = count + 1 tur.write(count) pnt.write(count) screen = getscreen() screen.onclick(onclick) # or if not in the onclick() function: def mirror(): internal_count = 0 for x, y in coords: # both coords unpacked from one list pnt.goto(x, -y) # flipped/negative y -&gt; flipped on x axis pnt.dot(5) internal_count += 1 pnt.write(count) &amp;#x200B;
plz read the sidebar.
Not unless your code runs the same in a python2 interpreter.
I'm a current BS Mechanical Engineering student (graduating this semester) with some other majors sprinkled in but I have experience with Linear Algebra, Index Notation (Fluid Mechanics), strong Python background, and I've done a data analyst role using Python. I also have some experience using LinearRegression and train/testing. I think you're trying to point that the class you mentioned can teach someone what Python functions to call and what lines to type. I may definitely be misrepresenting your argument, so please let me know if I am. For me personally, the Andrew Ng course dictates how one would go about writing (for example, a linear regression (LR)) and I was able to fill in the variable substitution and matrix math myself with my knowledge; however, implementing a LR at that level is not necessary in Python in the same way that one does not need to implement their own sort in Python. I think the Andrew Ng course is recommended to provide a foundation in ML. For example, learning sorting algorithms can assist you in developing new sorting algorithms or debugging issues if you're using a built-in version of sort. As another example, I've implemented computer vision NNs/machine learning algorithms, but I couldn't possibly explain to you why it works. This is why I'm avoiding your challenge, because I know how to call the correct libraries and split my dataset. Previous internships taught me how to clean the data and prepare it for processing. I definitely can call LinearRegression on that data and plot the results on matplotlib. But--the Andrew Ng taught me what is going on behind the scenes when I call that LinearRegression function and it was math/notation I was very familiar with so it was easy to grasp. I don't think me creating a function called "LinearRegression" with my notes from the Andrew Ng course gets to the point you're trying to address with the course. In other words, I think this is a similar format to the theory vs application discussions that exist in many disciplines. Once again, if I'm wrong, let me know! 
For the same reason that when I teach someone about SQL injection, I don't just point them at a vulnerable app and hand them sqlmap. Otherwise, you end up with someone who _needs_ specific tooling to achieve their goal and is beyond useless when that tooling fails. A lot of the time, they can't even figure out why it failed, because they have no understanding of what it's actually doing under the hood. This is massive problem within the security industry, and I'd imagine the ML/data scientist space has the same issue. If you know the theory, implementing it is easy. Of course it's far easier to just `from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier`, but that person is nowhere nearly as marketable nor valuable as someone who could write their own RNN if required.
i learned to write a game in Python from a guy doing example one, so i like that one
Are you sure it's download and not the installation process itself? `pip` is terribly slow when installing certain things. For me, it can take a minute per package to "install" (it doesn't really need to install, just to verify that the packages are installed) in a setup which has about 7 very popular packages from pypi and 3 of my own packages. The overall process takes about 6 minutes (which is slower than creating and starting a whole VM with all those packages already installed in any of the public clouds, for example).
Type and explain but of course edit it down.
Did you already know Python, or were you also learning Python and game programming at the same time?
i already knew python, but nearly everything in the video was new to me
Which parts would you like to see edited?
Hey, I finally got my ~~sh~~git together and [put it up on github](https://github.com/JabrZer0/ecosym).
If you have experience with linear regression models, it would be disingenuous to say that the Andrew Ng course is your first exposure to the topic. It's not so much "theory vs application", although I personally think application should come before theory (and in your case it did), but it's more that someone asked, on a Python forum, about learning ML in Python. Everyone responds with a theoretical course in Octave. That's just wrong and not helpful.
There's a big difference between someone being a professional data scientist or ML software engineer and someone who wants to be pointed in the direction of learning ML with Python. Also, I never said learn a library and then stop there and try to get a job, I said learn some applications first and then go into theory. For someone who wants to dabble in ML with a Python background, they should start with scikit-learn, learn the basics of creating ML models, then if they want to dive deeper go back and learn the theoretical underpinnings. They can go the other way around too, but most people I know who just hop straight into the theory are like "holy shit this is a lot of math" and wash out in a couple weeks.
Long running scripts, mistakes (unless they could be made into learning opportunities), paying pizza delivery guy. 
This was a simplified view of my problem, there are hundreds of items to choose from and a dozen or so attributes. But all the constraints are quite simple. I guess that changes things!
&gt; but most people I know who just hop straight into the theory are like "holy shit this is a lot of math" and wash out in a couple weeks. That's a feature, not a bug, of learning theory first.
Reminder: This low rent spammer has more user accounts than you can shake a stick at.
I'll check it out, thanks 
Thanks for the advice, I'll definitely check it out. Is this identifiable as a liner problem purely through the lack of squares and cubes? Seems like if I'd have been able to identify the type of problem I was trying to solve I'd have gotten much more useful search results!
I’ve been doing #2, thinking it’s the best balance between thorough instruction and mind-numbing watching-the-grass-grow (typing)
Don't waste your money
Thanks for your response, I'll be checking this out. I guess I needed to better identify the type of problem I was trying to solve.
No, that's just being an asshole. Universities do this to weed out people who they don't want to give a degree to, in order to increase the degree's value. There's no need to do this to someone who just wants to learn on their own time out of curiosity.

I always highly recommend the book [Algorithms of the Intelligent Web](https://www.manning.com/books/algorithms-of-the-intelligent-web-second-edition). It's the best mix of Python, theory, and application that I've found. It assumes foundational Python/numpy and linear algebra knowledge, but I picked it up pretty easily with zero numpy and LA understanding. Will teach you how to implement lots of different ML solutions without skimping out on providing the "how" and "why."
Certain browsers have certain drivers for example, the chrome web browser uses chromium as a driver. What the error is saying is that the path where the driver that the browser you are trying to use has to be included in the environment variable path. But don’t quote me on that.
If you are trying to use Firefox the driver for that is geckodriver, when it is installed all you have to do is append it to the PATH variable.
I had to verify but I never said Andrew Ng is my first exposure to the topic. I think everyone is saying to go with the course because it is fairly easy to transition between languages at a high level.

It's not being an asshole, it's being up front with people with what they're getting into before they sink hours into learning. I assume anyone asking for help on learning a topic has the intention of actually learn it, and not just dabble enough to have a barely passable understanding.

Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
The things that speed up python are: 1. The same th
Well I think this is the heart of the problem, as I am not a pro or something I am not sure about the form. I am building a Python-Flask-based web server, so files are uploaded using HTTP.
Taking an intro to python course. I have a dictionary with a list of states (keys) and their capitals (values). The assignment is basically to return a list of the capitals if the capital includes the name of its state. It seems pretty easy, right? If the value contains the same word as the key, add the value to a list, then print the list. Problem is, I don't actually know how to do this. Like, *at all.* 3 hours in, and the only thing I know is I don't understand python or dictionaries well enough to do this. I think it'll be something like: if value (whatever the python code for 'contains' is) key Add the value to a list (I don't know how to do this) else continue to the next key (I also don't know how to do this) print list &amp;#x200B; Either that, or take the dictionary and create 2 lists: a key list and a value list. Then if the key appears in the value list, add the value to a third list, then spit out the list. This is like, second day of class stuff, and I'm not even able to sort it out using stackoverflow. I think I'm in the wrong class....
Did you already check the book 'automate the boring stuff with Python'? 
Why? If you know Python, understand programming logic, then learn the syntax of the language that fits your need most. It sounds like the main things you're doing to speed up Python is to use libraries which are written in C. The Python community doesn't need to win the battle for speed, that's not the goal of Python.
Just released version 0.5 of [reader](https://github.com/lemon24/reader), a feed aggregator library + web UI. This minor release fixes a regression in the feed update time and enforces test coverage for the core modules.
Well that's interesting ! As I'm trying to reduce the charge wherever I can, I would like to avoid checking the filesystem every T time. Maybe the flask app can communicate to the demon and tell it that the upload has ended ? I've seen that it is possible to implement communication between multiprocessing processes but for now if I want a priority queue (which could be helpful later) I only have threading's thread. Also, how do you make the demon continue to wait for a sign after it got one ?

It is recognizable as a Math Programming problem because it fits the form minimize/maximize f(x) subject to constraints. The lack of squares and cubes makes this a linear program (a subset of math programming that is easier to solve) instead of a nonlinear program (hard for a computer to solve).
I installed geckodriver in /usr/local/bin/ and tried to append to Path by running: &amp;#x200B; \&gt;export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/geckodriver &amp;#x200B; and when that didn't work I tried &amp;#x200B; \&gt;export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin/geckodriver &amp;#x200B; And I keep getting the same error. &amp;#x200B;
That seems like a whole lot of new possibilities on front me me. Thank you, I will give it a look
Now that's something quite useful that I didn't know. Thx.
If you really want to learn ML, you should disregard all the people in the comments section saying that you must do it their way. Some folks don't want you to take Andrew Ng's course because they like others better. Those people are unintentionally being ignorant. That's like saying, "I know you know about this subject, but Jimmy is my teacher and I only learn from Jimmy". Uh ok. Maybe take both courses and see which one you learn from better? That being said, consider taking Machine Learning Fundamentals by Sanjoy Dasgupta from UC San Diego on edX. I helped designed and build that course, and we received a lot of good feedback. Or take a different one. Really, do whatever you think works for you.
Then Celery and Rabbit are definitely NOT overkill

Did you tried fix from that link: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40208051/selenium-using-python-geckodriver-executable-needs-to-be-in-path](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40208051/selenium-using-python-geckodriver-executable-needs-to-be-in-path) &amp;#x200B; from selenium import webdriver driver = webdriver.Firefox(executable\_path=r'your\\path\\geckodriver.exe') &amp;#x200B;
If you do `echo $PATH` you'll find that /usr/local/bin should already in your PATH env var. You can prove the path is set correctly as python sees it by importing the os library and doing `import os` `print(os.getenv("PATH"))`
I'm not crazy about autocomplete either. After trying deoplete and YCM, I'm running autocomplete-free.
I didn't say you were being disingenuous, I said it would be disingenuous to say that. The person in question said they wanted to pick up a new skill in ML, so based on that information I would assume they had no experience, and would benefit more from learning basic libraries and applications in of ML in Python. You responded to my comment that you felt like you were totally comfortable applying the skills you learned in a couple weeks of the course, and left out the part that you already had extensive experience in Python data analysis, so you are clearly not in the same boat as the OP. At a high level, yeah jumping around languages is not a big deal. But this is a Python forum, Python is the language of ML nowadays, and I don't see the controversy in pointing out that a theoretical course in Octave is not a terribly good answer for someone looking for a Python course. And, by the way, there is also several deep theoretical courses in Python on Coursera with much better coursework then Andrew Ng's Machine Learning, I prefer this one (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/aml). Much longer course, but goes into much more depth, is more along the lines of combining Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course and his Deep Learning specialization, but with Python notebooks straight from the beginning. I don't think the Andrew Ng course is bad, it's just seriously overrated because it's been around a long time so even people who know almost nothing about ML know about the course.
It totally fits in the /r/PythonTextGames sub too.
There are non machine learning facial recognition algorithms, but it’s harder to implement. So I suggest you go look at Darknet(search on git) a CNN for image recognition. It’s wrote in C and CUDA. Real-time facial recognition usually need to be done by a dGPU. A raspberry pie ain’t gonna cut it. Also python isn’t that great for complex machine learning as it’s just way way way too slow.
Yes, when I run the second line it says: `Traceback (most recent call last):` `File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/common/service.py", line 76, in start` `stdin=PIPE)` `File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/subprocess.py", line 775, in __init__` `restore_signals, start_new_session)` `File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/subprocess.py", line 1522, in _execute_child` `raise child_exception_type(errno_num, err_msg, err_filename)` `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'your\\path\\geckodriver.exe': 'your\\path\\geckodriver.exe'` &amp;#x200B; `During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:` &amp;#x200B; `Traceback (most recent call last):` `File "&lt;pyshell#3&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;` `driver = webdriver.Firefox(executable_path=r'your\path\geckodriver.exe')` `File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/firefox/webdriver.py", line 164, in __init__` `self.service.start()` `File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/common/service.py", line 83, in start` `os.path.basename(self.path), self.start_error_message)` `selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException: Message: 'your\path\geckodriver.exe' executable needs to be in PATH.`

You do not need to know how to write an ANN by hand to use scikit-learn just like you don't need to know how an internal combustion engine works to drive a car. After all, we are in a Python subreddit, a language that is designed to abstract away as much as possible to give the programmer a user friendly experience. Like I said before, you can do very well in life writing code in Python without ever learning C, even though the core of most of Python is written in C.

If you type which geckodriver in a terminal what does that say?
 /usr/local/bin/geckodriver
It just hangs... for several seconds. And when I try to close the terminal it tells me "Do you want to terminate running processes in this window?"
Sounds great! Go for it. 
&gt;driver = webdriver.Firefox(executable\_path=r'your\\path\\geckodriver.exe') You would want to run `driver = webdriver.Firefox('/usr/local/bin/geckodriver')`
&gt;driver = webdriver.Firefox('/usr/local/bin/geckodriver') It resulted in this error: `Traceback (most recent call last):` `File "&lt;pyshell#1&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;` `driver = webdriver.Firefox('/usr/local/bin/geckodriver')` `File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/firefox/webdriver.py", line 151, in __init__` `firefox_profile = FirefoxProfile(firefox_profile)` `File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/firefox/firefox_profile.py", line 80, in __init__` `ignore=shutil.ignore_patterns("parent.lock", "lock", ".parentlock"))` `File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/shutil.py", line 315, in copytree` `names = os.listdir(src)` `NotADirectoryError: [Errno 20] Not a directory: '/usr/local/bin/geckodriver'`
It wants just the path, thats my bad. &amp;#x200B; `imac:~ $ which geckodriver` `/usr/local/bin/geckodriver` `imac:~ $ python3` `Python 3.7.2 (default, Jan 14 2019, 21:09:08)` `[Clang 10.0.0 (clang-1000.11.45.5)] on darwin` `Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.` `&gt;&gt;&gt; from selenium import webdriver` `&gt;&gt;&gt; b = webdriver.Firefox('/usr/local/bin/')` `&gt;&gt;&gt;`
Yeah that definitely makes sense too. Sometimes option two can move too quickly. But if you gauge about how long it would take someone to type the code, it shouldn’t be a problem. Send me a link when you’re done of you want👍
As already mentioned Cython is probably the way to go here. You should get good speed increases with just some of the more basic typing.

How did you install geckodriver?
It would be a fun exercise with imageio and numpy. You could pick a threshold for each color band and use the and operator to combine them.
Thanks, I'll take my question over there
The first time I just downloaded the latest one and put it in /usr/local/bin/ and when that didn't work I used brew install geckodriver which seemed to work
what is the output of `$ geckodriver --version`
In contrast, if you know how to apply it, learning the theory behind it becomes easier as well. Personally I prefer a combined approach. Learning theory while applying it at the same time, and learning the deeper parts of the theory afterwards. That approach feels the most natural and effective to me.

Interesting... what is the full source of your script?
You see the truth. Sant’IGNUcious is proud of you 😄
I'm just running it on Idle and the entirety of it is: from selenium import webdriver browser = webdriver.Firefox() 
Sorry, but I don't like this. If the operation is so expensive, then you almost always can afford an extra line or two to do it.
I dunno man, running out of ideas... what version of Firefox is installed on the system?

So, just in case you weren't aware of this, you can always just: from itertools import permutations l = list(permutations(["cat", "dog", "bear"])) And get your answer. However, if you're trying to learn something, have a hard look at your use of reviewList. If that's what you're putting into your result list in the version where you try to capture all the perms in a single list, bear in mind that you will be repeatedly putting a reference to the same object into a list over and over again. If you then modify the contents of reviewList, then the list that has all the references to it will reflect the actual contents of reviewList when you observe it. Try this: you say you have a version where you're returning the list of lists, but all you get are a list of empty lists, but the number of empty lists matches the number of permutations you're expecting. Suppose you assign the return value from myPermutationGenerator() to a variable 'l' like so: l = myPermutationGenerator(myList) Try this with l: l[0] is l[1] In other words, test object identity. You'll see that not only are both of these empty lists, they are actually the **same** empty list. Your return list is probably filled with references to the same empty list (check arbitrary indicies to verify this). Given the code you shown, my guess is that you add reviewList to your final result list whenever inputList == \[\], however you 1) use reviewList for collecting all permutations, and 2) freely change the contents of reviewList not realizing that you have lots of references to it when you thought it was in a particular state. You need to wrap your head around the notion that a mutable object can have multiple references to it, and if you mutate the value via one reference, all the other references will see the same mutation. In your case, consider what might make the list referred to by reviewList become empty. Then consider where you might have other references to it. I think there's enough clues in the above that if you think about it you'll see where you're going wrong.
This has also nothing to do with a iteration-problem. All the solutions (including stretches and iterator hacks), where roundabouts and no real solutions to the problems walrus-operator is solving.
Yeah you right about expensive operations but it is only one example usage of it you can check original examples at PEP 572 they are better than mines. Also there is nothing too much to learn about you only have to pass variable name and function to library
Also i published it for the people want to use it. this isn't a hard worked library or some big library it is only 14 lines of code (if you remove setting name for method part it is 9lines of code (including newlines) with only one attribute and one method)
It's been a while since I looked at the previous versions of the course but I did recently go through v3. My impression was more that the kaggle references are there to show just how well you can do with the concepts you are learning. This emphasizes the applied approach of the course. You are learning how to apply powerful and relevant concepts now, rather than after years of study. I think they are also easy for people to dive into since the data and guidelines are there already vs finding your own data and trying to figure out if you are actually building a strong model 
yea that is right. I have an [xxx.py](https://xxx.py) file that I want to send to someone. If they don't have python3 it won't work. Is there any way to bypass this without having to instruct them on how to download and use the python3 interpreter 
Whilst this could be achieved with Python, this seems a long way round to achieve your goal. Unless you specifically want to use this as a learning exercise, I’d recommend a video editing tool; maybe download the trial for Camtasia which can do what you want easily in a few minutes.
We did the same. Switched to pipenv for a bit but eventually gave up after so many issues. It’s a shame.
Agreed. Learn a piece of theory, then apply. Rinse and repeat.
Anyone else misread this as Text based Jack Black game?
Maybe we can get a Jablinksi Games play through video?
just took a quick look at poetry. doesnt support simple .env files...
thnx , then should i do this with no electronic card? if yes how it will be? cus my degree is in embedded systems that's i have to..
I would say it's OK to start with but what you really want is a message queue. Monitoring queue length, job retrying upon failure, dead letter queues, and client crash handing are all things you'll eventually want to do that redis doesn't do out of the box but something like sqs or rabbitmq does.

Hey, I want to learn algorithms with Python but I can't find any resources that teaches basic algorithms like graph theory with Python. Does anyone have any tutorials, videos, or textbooks that teaches algorithms with Python. Thanks for the Help! BTW: I want to learn it ASAP and am new to reddit so I couldnt make a post and decided to comment this. Sorry if it causes a problem.

Now let me ask you, what recommendations do you have for Python courses?
If you're not doing digital makeup, performance won't be that crucial. https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/facerec_on_raspberry_pi.py
You will probably want to use PYGAME for it.
Kind of a shame... I don't know, I've been using poetry for a while now and it works great, at least for me. Poetry scripts are your regular command-line entry-points. The fact that it doesn't support npm-like scripts (yet) is a bit frustrating, but it's not a deal-breaker. Poetry still stands as the best tool I've tried so far.
I've had that recommended on 2 of those sites, Let me look that up and see what it is. Thanks.
I’ll be done in April. This will be for my boto3 course on Linux Academy. Please check us out!
That's the problem though. I want them to be able to run the code
There’s no easy way to convert python 2 to python 3 without manually changing code. If that was the case, everyone would update their python 2 systems to python 3 and then continue using python 3. This is the reason that python 2 is so commonly used despite being obsolete. 
The Andrew Ng course on Coursera now uses Python -- I am in it. 
I would look into enumerate (a builtin function).
I've heard the internets haz stuff
Try r/learnpython
`cat -n file1 &gt; file2` Or, if you really need Python... ```python def add_nums(in_file_name, out_file_name): with open(in_file_name) as in_file, open(out_file_name, 'w') as out_file: for num, line in enumerate(in_file): out_file.write(f'{num}: {line}') ``` The most Pythonic way, I suppose
It actually worked to use pyinstaller to create a standalone executable. All good now. Thanks though 
Yea I figured as much. Found a workaround creating an executable. All good now 
Are you using (deep) machine learning in your bot? If so, can't you use one of the libraries made for that (which perform all of their calculations in CUDA C and Fortran)? And if not... You're planning to defeat DeepMind with A\* or something? Good luck with that, yo.
This is my code so far for anyone curious: (I'm having trouble trying to substitute "x" for a user input x value) &amp;#x200B; class LinearEquation: x\_value = "x" def \_\_init\_\_(self, m, b): self.slope = m self.yintercept = b &amp;#x200B; def \_\_str\_\_(self): global expression expression = str(self.slope) + str(x\_value) + "+" + str(self.yintercept) return expression def evaluate(self, x): self.x\_value = x eval(expression) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; def main(): f = LinearEquation(5,3) print("f(x) =",f) print("f(3) =",f.evaluate(3),"\\n") &amp;#x200B; main()
If you're certain you weren't able to do the assignment, talk to your prof. It would've been better if you would have done that immediately, but he would still (most likely) understand. Either way, I don't think basically asking for solutions on Reddit is the way to tackle the situation at hand. As for your post itself; format the code, r/learnpython, "no homework questions"
We have mostly shut down the mirror network. PyPI runs behind Fastly which operates cache nodes all over the world.
I never thought about telling my professor — I guess I instinctively thought of that as a privilege that I had no right to ask for. Thanks for re-directing me to the right discussion group, and for another solution to this situation Wilfred. Appreciate your thoughts! 
Same, I moved my company's django projects to pipenv 6 months ago in order to manage the dependencies and virtual environments. Unfortunately, the tool is not stable, and are currently moving back to pip. I tried poetry on a small library, and it was incredibly easy to publish it on PyPI. I will try again for sure
Pipenv is just another bandwagon tool for a problem that doesn't exist.
Reactjs too. Who maintains copyright on anything entered? Where is the FAQ?
Seconded on both points. Learn from multiple sources, and the UCSD course is a good option. No reason to hinder your efforts by excluding good information. 
Amazing... simply amazing. How did you learn PyGame? I want to learn it myself but don't know how. Just made a course last week of level 1 python and want to try some things out
electronic card? Do you mean GPU? You should PM me if you have any questions. I’m more than happy to help.
Please do. It is hands down the best intro course to ML.
The other day, I posted a project I have been working on that takes a video and converts it to ascii with audio. I have continued to work on it and have colorized the ascii characters based on the original content. Still working out some kinks around memory usage but wanted to share what I have so far. Source is here for anyone interested https://github.com/8-bitz/AsciiArt 
Pip and mannually pin requirements. Easy , it works. Ohhh, its too hard to create a new venv? Bah, another command without the problems of pipenv.
Doesn't work with my touchscreen tablet unless I attach a mouse.

Over the years I've found that using any new tooling around dependency management is not worth the hassle it is nearly guaranteed to present if you do almost /anything/ outside of the author's assumed workflow. Even pip gives me headaches... Well maybe not pip, but the difference in dependency location handling. For example, I had a project where I needed to vendor a 3rd party library. pip local filesystem dependencies just fine but standard setuptools didn't. Which in turn meant that I couldn't use tox and such for test runs as they're dependent on setuptools. Point here is, that headache was caused by tooling one level removed from the core setuptools. I really, /really/ would prefer to not venture beyond that. For any reason. No matter how shiny the claims are. I need packaging to just work as expected. 
Pip 19 has support for pyproject.toml. I'm thinking to go pure pip.. 
Which tablet? It works fine on Apple devices 🤔

Anyone have experience with pythonloc and PEP 582 ? seems to be exactly what I want. [goodbye virtual environments ](https://medium.com/@grassfedcode/goodbye-virtual-environments-b9f8115bc2b6) I’m planning to try it on my next project.

Lynda or Data Science A-Z on Udemy helped me a lot. Curious as well as to responses since a lot of courses and books look amazing but after digging in to them is a lot of fluff, going off topic, or focusing too much on statistics (which yes is vital in data sceience but I can read a stats book if I want aha)
is there any way you would be willing to share code on this? I have been thinking about trying to do this but wouldn't have a clue where to start lol
I’m glad you asked these things. I hadn’t thought to put that information up. What would you expect to see in a FAQ?
AKA "I asked people who didn't care, and since they didn't care we decided not to go further". Are people at PyCon likely to be representative of the body of users? No. Sort of like asking people in quadriplegics which running shoes they prefer...

The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!

Sure, that's why type hints in 2.7 is not ideal. What does 3.6 pypy with type hints get you that doesn't work in stock python 3.6?
 def die() : global dead dead = True I found this utterly hilarious for some reason...
I made dying a separate function for restarting but when I couldn’t get it to work I just left it in there. I’m glad someone else found that funny. 
You need to cast the input values to numbers
Ah this is pretty cool! Bird up brother!
1. Variables in python have **types**. 2. When you get a variable using input it is of type **string** 3. Python is trying to tell you are trying to mix multiple types. ie a **string** and an **int** together 4. Strings are typically represented with quotation marks "blah blah" 5. If a string contains a digit, you can cast it to an integer type with **int('1')**
sounds like a scam.
Write a python programs that will check if a number is an armstrong number and if two words are anagram. 
When I was learning python, I kind of went at it in an unorthodoxed way and tried to learn the project management first. I've found that in learning a new language, I want to get project management and the dev environment figured out before I start working with the language. If I start with 8 chapters of crap, starting with 'hello world', then I end up being 8 chapters in when the author says, "now we're going to start doing everything completely different from the way you've been doing it." So, I learned venv first. Anyone who says venv is hard is either doing something really wrong, or really chose the wrong course material to learn from. I really wish programming tutorials and docs would start out with proper project structure though. 
Cheers for sharing! I've recently started making a game to learn pygame and more python myself! Definitely alot of fun! 
I have looked at your code. If I had to use global variables anytime, I would always try to make a class if possible and I think implementation of classes for game state and game assets will remove all of those global vars and can help you create a much cleaner and maintainable code. Also if I have a class I would create a new instance of game state class and use that to restart game somehow.
&gt; Trying to figure out why Jetbrains excluded secondary schools in their licensing Wow, where did you see this? Reading their [educational licence agreement](https://www.jetbrains.com/store/license_classroom.html), they don’t make a distinction between primary (elementary) and secondary schools so I would assert that both are covered: &gt; 1.2. "Customer" or "You" means a public or private school, college, training course provider, university or other post-secondary educational establishment specified in the Subscription Confirmation, exercising rights under, and complying with the terms of this Agreement. and for the Toolbox Licence subscription for individuals: &gt; 1.2. "Customer" or "You" means a student or an instructor specified in the Subscription Confirmation who is at least 13 years old, or in the case of Redistributable Products the sole proprietor or legal entity with sufficient legal capacity to enter into this Agreement using the Redistributable Product in accordance with this Agreement. For the purpose of this Agreement, a student is an individual who is enrolled at a recognized educational institution (university, college, high school, primary school or a similar institution with educational goals), and upon request by JetBrains is able to provide proof of such enrollment. For the purpose of this Agreement, an instructor is an individual who gives lectures and/or seminars at a recognized educational institution (university, college, high school, primary school or a similar institution with educational goals), and upon request by JetBrains is able to provide proof of such involvement. Is it a case that JetBrains is asking you to confirm the schools status as an accredited or recognised secondary education institution? Their education website makes no explicit mention of excluding secondary schools: https://www.jetbrains.com/buy/classroom/
As i use docker for all things i really dont need pipenv, but it jas worked great for me when not in docker.
Thank you! I’ll definitely look into that! 
Hey man, this is a very cool project. And I am just currious how long does it take you to convert the original video to ascii.
When I try running it, I get a TypeError on your Bird class. Update() must be called with Bird instance as first argument, is this because it doesn’t take in self? 
He ded? &gt; dead = True
Never mind, corrupt pygame install on my Mac. My side. 
Sorry for forgetting to mention that switching pypi mirror works in China.
Also the same in Java and C#, although in C# you can also use "x?? y", which I personally really like. This double question mark is called the "null coalescing oprator".
