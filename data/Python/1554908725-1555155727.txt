Well, I have not read PEPs so much, but you must at least take a look at PEP-8.
Basically why not? To learn about the design philosophy. And well PEP8 at least is somehow interesting, although your IDE will probably take care.
The design philosophy of individual features? I'd look into asyncio then, and maybe context managers.
[PEP-0572](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0572): the great divider.
These should be methods. Making all methods with no arguments properties will come back to bite you. That is not the purpose of properties. I think you should absolutely fix these now before any code is written that depends on them
I don't. I just looked it up and tmux is actually more powerful than screen. BUT I like screen for its simplicity. Took me a few minutes to get the hang of it with just a few commands. I only use the following: "screen" starts a screen session. Can be called from within another session. "Ctrl-a, d" to detach. "screen -x" to attach if only one screen session is open, otherwise it will list available sessions. If you get a list attach with "screen -r sessionid" I think tmux would have taken me a bit too much to study and remember, while screen I picked up in minutes. Unless people need the extra power and flexibility of tmux, I prefer screen. (I'm also a vi over emacs guy...)
What did you do to fix this? Other folks might appreciate your newfound knowledge

Sorry to see the other replies are dismissive of PEP value. Compared to other language specifications, I find PEPs to be concise, easy-to-digest, and often fun to read. &amp;#x200B; The most important PEPs, I would say, are the ones I wish my colleagues would read because the topics within are relevant on an almost daily basis. I consider these to be basic python knowledge for a senior engineer. Take that with a grain of salt, I suppose. &amp;#x200B; PEP 1: PEP Purpose and Guidelines: [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001) \- skim this to get an idea of what's inside, and read it as you become more curious about PEPs after reading some PEP 20: The Zen of Python: [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) \- a good introduction to Python for any level of experience, but a good reminder of how to write idiomatic code PEP 484: Type Hints: [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) \- invaluable when your code base grows, especially if you use an IDE \- the optional nature of type \*hints\* allows you to add them as needed, which is especially useful when you can annotate someone \*elses\* code while working on it, to aid your understanding of it \- 560 may be relevant: [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0560/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0560/) PEP 440: Version Identification: [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/) \- You will be amazed how many developers do not understand the Python versioning scheme. \- Useful when you begin publishing your own packages, or dealing with installed dependencies Advanced: PEP 443: Single Dispatch Generics: [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0443/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0443/) \- for polymorphism, useful when writing a library

First, congrats on your degree, that's a great first step. Second, you could answer questions/aid whenever you have time. Think Uber for learning, but without the car insurance
Wow a lot of suggestions, thank you! There are some ideas I already considered adding so it's cool you also thought of them. Also, I'm currently in the process of migrating to a game engine so I can add some buttons to improve the navigation as you suggested. I will definitely check out those links when I have time. Thank you again!
Awesome, will look into that, thanks!
Atom loaded with the appropriate packages is quite powerful and easy to use.
Well, since I first thought that Anaconda only contained a collection of packages, I was trying to figure out how to import those modules into the version of Python 3.7 I’d downloaded separately. Then, Bremme worked out that Anaconda came with a version of Python pre-installed, and that I in fact had two different Python environments installed. So to make sure I was only using the version that came with Anaconda, I started using Spyder in the Anaconda Navigator, and got no errors.
Other than stackoverflow and the docs, not really. I already knew a little bit about functions, and the usual if, while, for, etc. but working with classes, dictionaries and other stuff was new to me. I think what helped me the most was having a clear image of what the program should do and then think of ways to code that. And also look into other people's code, that can give you new ideas on how to tackle a problem.
Thank you! I appreciate it :)
Tic Tac Toe is pretty unsurprising so the little things made it a lot of fun. Another notable one was one the game is about to end as cats and the robot had the last move it would set its piece on top of yours and would try to start a Bro Down. Inspired by South Parks Randy Marsh vs Stephen Sondheim.
Writing a function to automatically backup folders of my choosing to google drive by mounting my google drive as a local drive and using os to copy over. To speed it up it references a log file to see if it has been modified since the last time it was moved.
PEPs are great examples of well written design docs. They do a great job describing the design and documenting *why* that design. Also serve as both a useful reference and a useful tangible document to argue about. &amp;#x200B; I have PEP 484 noted as particularly good. That's the one that adds static types, so it's complicated. [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) PEP 492 is particularly meaty since it's a lot of the addition of async stuff. It's harder to read though. [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/) PEP 498 on `f'strings'` is easy reading [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/)
If you are looking for some good classes on python and you live near UNI (University of Northern Iowa) you should visit Wartburg College just north of there. Dr. John Zelle is there and he is an absolute wizard with python and has written a few books that you should definitely check out!

Why is there a random help page for a PHP ERP system posted in /r/python? Are you lost?
depends, what is your main interest? low level? high level? packaging?
I’m a Canadian but I’ll look him up. I’ve been watching a lot of content involving python so it’s nice to get some new names of people publishing current stuff. Thanks!
I used an online class through my High School to learn python. To get you started, just know the following: You NEED to indent to put things inside things. An indentation is 4 spaces and the tab key should do this automatically. With variables, the variable is on the left when assigning it. Give variables meaningful names, and if they are more than 1 word, use camelCase. Also don't give variables names that are important to the language, like "print" or the likes. Not everything may be built in, you may need to import modules. Keep this in mind if something isn't working because it's not defined (Like sqrt() ) With loops, make SURE that there is a way to get out before running it so the program won't crash.
Easy! Turn off the computer!

Why do you alternate between camel casing and snake casing for your function names? Sorry idk how to fix your problem I'm just curious if there's any reason to this.
Thanks for looking it up. Actually it doesn't sound like screen is a lot different from tmux, they just have different shortcuts for the functionality you named. I don't see the vi / emacs analogy in this one. I even find those too complicated (however I never used emacs). I use NotePad++ or Atom.

Noted, thanks! *Making all methods with no arguments as properties* is not a true statement. I have given it a thought and the methods which are exposed to end user with no arguments and just do simple action and return self (eg: Browser.refresh) are made as properties. It's not illegal in Python. Anyway, I see both side of the arguments and will take this feedback back to the board :-)

 .. anything... It depends on whom you make scripts for, or for what purpose.
I guess to add to my questions... &amp;#x200B; \#1- Do most of these jobs require a 4 year degree? \#2- Can you give an example of different job titles? &amp;#x200B; Just trying to do my own research and learn based on that. Than kyou
This doesn't really feel like the right place to ask this question but I can see you're overwhelmed so I'm just commenting to hopefully help \&gt; I’m almost convinced that time could be better spent learning how to code on my own From your descriptions, it sounds like your learning has been all over the board which is a big problem. I'd say pick something (e.g web dev or general software) and look up one of the many study plans online for a directed form of learning which is better in the long run. \&gt; The more I read about Data Science I’m overwhelmed. I feel like I’m trying to compete in a market full of geniuses who went to top schools and have a very good education in math, statistics, and stuff that honestly, is a bit over my head. I’m not sure if I want to try to self-teach myself these things because frankly, I think you’d need a formal education to learn a lot of the deep details of such topics… If your first goal is a career transition into software, I'd say focus just on learning to program and on getting the fundamentals, then work your way into a second career transition if you'd like. In my honest opinion, transitioning into DS is hard because of various reasons and you might end up burning yourself out before getting to this point (heck, I WORK in ML and the job search is brutal) All the best, keep your chin up
No problems! Yeah hit me up if you feel the need to. I can answer any questions regarding Python. Aswell as questions such as what module, IDE or text editor to use :)
Appreciate the honest reply.
I guess enough people accidentally get the expensive one to make up for lost sales

That meme used to crack me up on YTMND
in that case maybe you want to fork samocad? https://vvs1864.github.io/samocad/en_index.html
Do you use it often ? How is the learning curve ?
Will this be recorded? With all due respect, 3PM ET is in the middle of the workday for half of North America....actually all of NA.
&gt; Do most of these jobs require a 4 year degree Most of the jobs, yes. But some of the jobs, no. &gt; Job titles Depends.. Too broad. Python can be used in networking, system administration, security, data science etc.. these are some broad job titles. Most of the companies will mention Python as a requirement. As for me, I suggest you leave the degree course and go with certifications. 30y is not the age to spend another 4 years to persue a degree. Just an advice (sorry no hate, just practically writing). I was an employer, I would *not* prefer you for hire, because tbh (really sorry again), I would want a person who has the will to widstand the degree bs. Believe me, we all know that it's damn painful to waste 3/4y in a degree program, but me personally take it as fun along with *grabbing* knowledge. You can either see it as time waste or a gold mine of future contacts that may help you, and you help them to make $, refer a job, start a business in future.. That's mainly what university is for.. All other *'education'* line is total bs. You can study more online when alone. Your path (imho) should be: - Get Certifications in emerging fields - Goto bootcamps, get certs, self study &amp; make small tools (host of github to showcase) for languages you learn. Pick Python or Java. - Meet people more aggressively. Goto conferences, bootcamps, meetups and stay exited. Pls don't show your disappointment of you to yourself, to anyone in profession. It turns down the employers. They want someone who's happy with what they do and would not bs talk about life problems while coding. There is no time for that. Hooe this helps &amp; works out for you!
Yes but why k means instead of DB scan
That's a lot of different questions. Like the other comments say, it's good to focus on one or two areas that really interest you. Taking a free online course (Udacity, Coursera, edX) or doing a small project, or both, will help you decide if that field is appealing to you. Most data science jobs ads I've seen ask for a MSc or PhD in a quantitative field (engineering, computer science, mathematics, eeconomics) plus programming experience, plus sometimes relevant domain knowledge. However, I do think a strong Github portfolio can make up for a lack of an advanced degree in some situations, especially if you can convince them that you know what you're talking about. Udacity had a really good intro course for Github, but there are many others out there. If you hang around on StackOverflow you should see a number of jobs ads that include Python as a prerequisite. And saying that, StackOverflow just released this years developer survey results. Maybe reading that could help you solidify some of your ideas? Best of luck OP :)

Does your python build have profile guided optimisation? Basically where the output is executed in numerous ways to see how it runs and optimise intelligently. What output are you specifically looking for? It might be easier to just record all the output and search through it, or to just filter it as it comes with grep.
RemindMe! 1 hours
yep, absolutely! :) will be on [youtube.com/cs50](https://youtube.com/cs50) afterwards!
you should pop in and ask Nick when we're live! ;)
If it does I didn't mean it to. Like I said though. I did ./configure --enable-optimization, because it was recommended to me to build it this way.
I'm going through my favorite r/python reddit posts for inspiration because I am still a noob
[PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) not only because they are important as guidelines, but also because they provide some wonderful insights that one can use regardless of coding language, even when not coding (references to [The Elements of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style)). &gt;Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that he make every word tell. Other than that I enjoyed reading the recent [PEP 8001](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8001) regarding the governance model of Python.
&gt; The point is that the documentation for commercial software like Matlab is incredibly better and finding an answer to a Matlab question is incredibly easier, quicker and less frustrating. That has not been my experience with MATLAB *at all*. If I am only sticking to basic, ordinary stuff, then yes the documentation is usually okay. But once I start trying to do things remotely complicated, or using more advanced features, the documentation gets bad quick. And I have lost track of the number of days I have lost trying to fix bugs in my code that turned out to be due to the MATLAB documentation simply being wrong. In my experience the Python documentation, even third-party documentation, is much more consistently good. It may not be as good as the best MATLAB documentation, but unlike in MATLAB I am rarely left without any idea how I am supposed to do something due to critical aspects being either undocumented or the required documentation being hard to track down.
Can you elaborate on how you do remote deployment with PyCharm?
Good bot!
The figure describes the transformation from a regular spiking neuron model to the so-called "phase" coordinates, which makes the study of synchronization much easier. The neuron model in this example is the famous Morris-Lecar (ML) model, which was originally built to describe oscillations in barnacle muscle fiber, but has become well-known as a model of action potential generation and neural oscillations. &amp;#x200B; (a) A constant applied input current results in regular oscillations of the membrane voltage. The black curve represents the voltage variable of the ML model over time. (b) Phase coordinates. Each value of the voltage variable corresponds uniquely to a phase variable (modulo the period, which is approximately 60ms). The phase variable advances with constant velocity over time. (c) A full view of the periodic solution of the ML model. The voltage variable V is plotted on the x-axis against the gating variable w plotted on the y-axis. The circles are placed at constant time intervals, and reveals a non-constant velocity in this phase space.

Can I ask an honest question? I'm still fairly new to python. Is there a preferred format for it or as long as you do one style and stay consistent with it then it's ok? When I'm typing, I'm more comfortable using the underscore in my function names. I feel like it's easier to read, but if that's wrong, then I'll force myself to change.
Sure, but PyCharms docs do a great job of explaining this process! Tbh, I ignored the IDE docs for way too long, before realizing they're actually excellent and it made my life way easier. Also, keep in mind this feature requires the professional edition of PyCharm, but that's fairly cheap for most work and is free for anyone with a .edu email address. Check out this link for a primer: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/deploying-applications.html So, basically the idea is you do development on your laptop or desktop or whatever and then when you've made your changes and need to push them out and rerun the application on some server or deploy a model, etc, you have SFTP or something set-up via the deployment settings in the Tools drop-down and PyCharm auto saves, syncs the changes with your project files on the remote server and you can use a run configuration to run it or just SSH into the server and hit the go button. This is a more detailed walkthrough of the process and options: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-a-remote-server-configuration.html Hope that helps!
Late to the party. I’m using namedtuples a lot recently when I don’t need a new class and all the boilerplate, but I want dot notation and named fields. Especially when making APIs for other people to use. You can guarantee the fields will exist, and only the ones you officially support. I’m also enjoying closures at the moment.
Did that It's not giving me all the comments
Do a ./configure --help and see what --enable-optimization does.

Hey. :) Some symbols like spaces and colon can cause troubles depending on your filesystem, hence the default `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm-ss_SSS`. However, you can configure the format as you wish, just use the formatter specifier: `logger.add("file_{time:YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss}")`.
Technically not an API. Just a public document.
Awesome! Will check this out, looks promising :)

On the line where you imported maybe you dont have the thing youre importing downloaded or you typed something wrong
I bought an online course and downloaded Anaconda, the guy said that all the modules are included. How can I check if pandas_datareader is downloaded?
I looked at the exercise solution and I typed right, how can I check if I didn't download all the packages needed?
Can't believe it's you Corey! Thank you your videos have been soo helpful!
&gt; code: nearly identical to code found here What happens when you run \*\*identical\*\* code?
Assuming you're using jupyter notebook, hence Anaconda, in your base root, you need to install pandas. It's not automatically included. You can check to see what plug-ins you have installed in your library as well. For most imports you have to do this if you're new to anaconda
Otherwise, in your current file, open cmd prompt or terminal(for Mac) and pip install pandas
I thought yahoo’s api was deprecated?
Try redownloading it and make sure its in the right directory. Make sure its saved in the right spot
Thanks but I already tried looking up what I could and saw nothing about this output. Recompiling now without it to see if it goes away.
Well, there isn't enough information here to help, sorry.
Is that because the comments are paginated? Or are they just missing?
I typed "pip install pandas" in the Anaconda Prompt, and it says "Requirement already satisfied" and then writes the directory path to find where it is installed
The quoted piece is an announcement from /r/pythons official discord channel. I am asking how legit it is.
Also consider wxWidgets and wxPython (Phoenix) as an alternative to Qt and Tkinter. It has some GUI designers available: wxFormBuilder and wxGlade. I'm not sure if something similar exists for Qt, but I find wxGlade really helpful
Then I'm very interested! I'd love to be able to do that. Is there anything I need to do besides apply to that link?
Good luck. The devs recently added simplex noise, so that might be of interest. [https://godotengine.org/article/simplex-noise-lands-godot-31](https://godotengine.org/article/simplex-noise-lands-godot-31)
Python is the fastest growing computer language so yes. It is never too late learn.

For general workplace, no. If you go into a technical occupation, it will be useful. Self-learning will be quite important for programming. It's not really something you can teach by rote.
Well you never know what will be useful in 5-10 years I may be at a huge advantage knowing a program language
- 15 years old - is it too late to learn? Yes, I'm afraid it's too late, everyone begins coding at the age of 5, attempting to learn while being any older than that has a 100% fail rate. But, do not worry, we can send you back in time, last year we built a time machine in PHP :)
Is it too late for a 15 year old to learn? That's just a stupid question to ask.

There are people on here that ask if they are too old at 55 and older. There is nothing at 15 that it’s ‘too late to learn’. Just means that you may have to teach yourself, which is a literally invaluable skill to have.
Is there a sub for learning and not just news?
r/learnprogramming and r/learnpython are both good resources.
Thanks so much for tuning in, everybody! :) We built an entire k-means classifier today on stream that performed successfully, all from scratch!

Thank you Time to dust out the old pi, that thing could do python well
No prob, I just wondering if anyone saw output like this. If you had the problem it would be very obvious. Everytime you quit the buffer prints out hundreds of messages that start with "profiling:"
Thanks man. I was very curious about how these guys managed to develop an algorithm and process petabyes of data.
It was the underscores, all fixed now. Thanks!
Try running `which python` and make sure it's the anaconda version, then run `python` and type in `import pandas_reader` in the interpreter which should throw an error if it's not included
Don't be silly - you can learn Python in your spare time and during the holdiays.
Also it needs to be installed separately from pandas I believe (https://pandas-datareader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
This probably belongs in r/learnpython but You're not returning anything here, just outputing to stdout: def oddNumbers(l, r): for x in range(l,r+1): if x%2 &gt; 0: print(x)
Your function is printing values, but not returning values. In the end, your function will have a default return value of `None`, but `map` needs an iterable as its second argument. The best place to ask this would be on /r/learnpython, though
Ah thanks! Glad you’ve found them helpful
You'll want to ask this in /r/learnpython. However, you should post what you've tried at least, as it looks a bit like homework. We're happy to help with homework, but only once you've shown an attempt at it
Pycharm, Vim.
Visual Studio Code.
Vim
PyCharm. Many tried, but imho, no one comes close to JetBrains. And I like the fact that they don't allow themselves to be sold. Their one and only factor is the quality of the product. More companies should be like that.
Emacs
Basic PID cruise control: use [simple-pid](https://pypi.org/project/simple-pid/) and be done in an hour. Spend the rest of your week figuring out how to make the animation. [Pygame](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/) will probably be a good bet there.
Was checking it out, creating cruise control with basic programming won’t be an issue, for someone away from animation like me creating animations will be a pain
No problem! Yeah definitely check out that curses thing I showed. And yeah I saw in your code some pygame stuff. I assume that's what you're ultimately going to use. Oh and one more idea that just came to mind for future. You might be able to make ascii animations by clearing the screen and showing the same ascii but slightly moved and use time.sleep(0.2) for example in between each frame. I didn't look at your code much but one thing I noticed that could be improved was the repetition of print('~~~~~~~~~etc'). The long lines could be defined into a variable instead of repeated. That's nit picking though lol.
&gt; If you are about to ask a question about how to do something in python, please check out /r/learnpython. It is a very helpful community that is focused on helping people get answers that they understand.
Pycharm is the best!
Ok thanks
Unless you are being graded on the artistry of the animation, do the absolute minimum. 2d, top down, the car is an unadorned rectangle kind of thing.
So cool! Thanks for sharing this.
Dear lord, we've entered an "Extras" style of economy. Who knew it'd be in our lifetime
Just to note. The entire radio astronomy community, especially those using interferometer, almosy always use python for data workup and analysis.
Honestly I would use PyCharm as a main but there are to many features I need that are not available in the community edition and I am a HS student so I can't afford Pro.
You don't seem to be initializing the slist variable anywhere and it's always None.
From what I understand you're supposed to use snake casing for function names and any variables local to a function. Global variables are supposed to be in camel case. Many IDE's I've used actually highlight anything you do that doesn't follow these conventions (namely Pycharm by Jetbrains) which is how I got the impression that this is the standard.
Everything is fine up until the first `slist = shoppingList(slist)` call. That function has no explicit **return** statement, which means it implicitly returns None, which is precisely what **slist** is assigned to after that line.
So instead of the usual import antigravity they had to do a import gravity ?
&gt; 2019 &gt; must be compatible with 2.7.13 Pick one. I haven't heard any convincing arguments suggesting that anything's better than pyenv-virtualenv, though.
cool article.. . glad you gys are fighting the fight.... python has been fast enough for me... &amp;#x200B; learning more about deep stuff is great. keep it up. well written.
came here to say it should not be used. vscode is easy and free.
Thank you for sharing all of this!
Thank you that fixed it!
Wow crazy lol. This would do really well where I live in Nashville. If I knew ML and slightly more about python, I'd try to make the same. I did make a script that automatically saves images to a folder from like 30 photography subreddits in real time as they're submitted to reddit if they're over a certain file size. That was about the most related thing I've done lol. What you made is insane and sounds like something I'd do if I had the knowledge to do it.
Fuck this post and this guy. It was mentioned in the comments of the article and I'll mention it here, as well. This guy is an engineer in NYC. He can afford to eat. He's abusing his privilege, knowledge, and power, and actively harming others who can't afford to eat. I don't care how cool of a "hack" or how technically savvy this is. If he wants to show this off then he should have used it to do something ethically "good", like idk automate collecting meals or donations for food kitchens. Not only that, but this is borderline illegal because 1) he's automating an Instagram account which is against their TOS (plus he's doing it for profit), and 2) there is no mention in his post that his Instagram discloses that he is receiving free food in exchange for his posts. This is also borderline illegal in terms of FTC disclosure/endorsement guidelines.
I'm so jelly of this
Fuck influencer culture.
So because he made a system that legitimately advertises companies to Instagram, which legitimately helps those restaurants, and he does it for profit, he's bad? Because when all is said and done, that's what he's doing. Facebook and Google does the same thing. There's nothing wrong with trying to make money. Especially if what he's doing is legitimately helping advertise companies. And people who use Instagram to make money is bad? You said "(plus he's doing it for profit)". Since when is using Instagram to make money bad? He doesn't disclose that he's seeking food in his posts because his followers don't follow him for that. They follow him for NYC images. Nobody is forcing them to follow. He discloses the food part in his email. He's open about it.
Yeah me too I live in the Nashville area lol. Ton of good restaurants here.
vim
I'm so proud....❤️❤️👏👏👏👏
Not really, just PM me when you're finished applying to get a faster followup.
&gt;legitimately Nope, first off, he doesn't discuss \_who\_ follows him. It could be 90% fake/spam accounts. Anyone can pay for Instagram followers/commenters and do the same thing. It's unlikely that a typical restaurant owner would know how to legitimize his page. On top of that he automated the following/unfollowing of others to gain his own following. Like I said, that's a breach of Instagram's TOS. If he himself believed this wasn't sketchy than he would have posted his actual account. \&gt; Since when is using Instagram to make money bad? Nowhere did I say this in my post. I said that the \_way\_ he is using Instagram is bad/borderline illegal. \&gt; He doesn't disclose that he's seeking food in his posts because his followers don't follow him for that And that makes it okay? If I run a dog instagram with 10M followers and Purina pay's me 100k to post a picture of a bag of dog food, I don't have to disclose that because it's not a picture of a dog? No. It doesn't matter, any form of goods have to be disclosed. \&gt; He discloses the food part in his email. This just doesn't make sense at all. His email is between him and the restaurant owners. His followers don't see his email correspondences...
btw, Andrew Chael contributed far more to this effort than Katie (https://github.com/achael/eht-imaging/graphs/contributors) any look at this contribution data clearly shows this
He actually did explain how he gets followers. He followed and unfollows people, as well as uses hashtags. And yes he could have technically paid for his followers too, but it appears as if he gained those followers naturally. And you're right. The average restaurant owner won't know how to legitimatize his page. They won't know hardly anything about ig. They will see a page with a large NYC following and a good page history. That might be enough for some owners to bite the bullet and offer a free meal to advertise to 23k locals. In one comment, you stated he most likely paid for followers, then two sentences down you said he gained a following by following and unfollowing others. You're not even consistent in your argument. It might technically be breaking tos but I don't see it as immoral. Maybe a little spammy if anything. People follow his account willingly. The way he uses his ig isn't illegal. Google automates search results. Then says "pay us a fee and we'll include you in our results". He automates picture listing and says "pay me in food and I'll include you in my results". It's not very different. Like I said at most he might technically be breaking tos. To me, if it's not immoral, I could care less what tos is broken. If he legitimately advertises a restaurant to 23000 locals and they see any uprise in customers as a result, then that is worth giving out the free meal and more to them. And you're wrong. Paid promotions aren't always disclosed as promotions. More often then not, they aren't disclosed as being promotions.
You mean like Jinja templates?
Absolutely! I'm glad astronomy is moving towards Python. This deprecates the old programming language that was popular (IDL). &amp;#x200B; If only they stop using Python 2.7
you can actually use Alt F4 on windows ;)
She imagined the algorithm. Without her there wouldn't be any Andrew contribution.
He certainly wrote a lot of code it seems, but I imagine the problem being solved was not purely about churning out code.
I was gonna say any analyzing and such I had done in my astronomy classes was always python. Not surprised by this at all.
RemindMe! 1 day

Thanks for the (mostly) reassuring reply.
At first I was like “oh cool, a link to the paper!”.....and then I started to read the paper and I was like “...ummmm, ok, I think I will just go back to watching the video.” =] Amazing work! That’s one small step for Pandas, one giant leap for Python!
Proof that Python 2 is still superior.
Not when astronomers rely heavily on numpy they don't. &amp;#x200B; [Numpy: Plan for dropping Python 2.7 support](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.14.2/neps/dropping-python2.7-proposal.html)
BeautifulSoup or something like it is probably your best bet. Might want to try pyquery.
Jokes on you....Astronomers are planning to drop numpy support in 2020.
Yeah CASA, developed by NRAO, is the primary tool for developing these images. If you are a python person just never dig into that source code...
I got you fam!
Imagine thinking that the person that wrote the most number of lines is the person that did the most work!
I really recommend using the invent with python resources. They are free and a great introduction to python. Especially the games one. That’s how I got started.
Seeing as how I'd guess 90% of this sub aren't professional devs, it doesn't surprise me they think this way. Writing code is easy when you know what needs to be done. For example, if you already know the algorithm....
\&gt; it appears as if he gained those followers naturally. automation != natural... \&gt; In one comment, you stated he most likely paid for followers, then two sentences down you said he gained a following by following and unfollowing others Again, you are failing to read clearly. I said "It could be 90% fake/spam accounts. Anyone can pay for Instagram followers/commenters and do the same thing". Nowhere in that statement do I accuse him of anything. EVEN WITH THAT SAID, the accounts he's following and unfollowing could also be fake/spam accounts. Instagram has an insane percentage of fake accounts, all of which use popular hashtags to drive traffic... \&gt; The way he uses his ig isn't illegal. Sure, probably not. But it violates TOS and should be removed. \&gt; Google automates search results. Google is a fucking search index. It's supposed to automate search results. It uses an entirely separate offering to insert advertisements, it's called Adwords. Google Adwords also 100% discloses when a result is an Ad, with a giant pill that says Ad next to it. Instagram is user generated content and explicitly not supposed to be automated. \&gt; If he legitimately advertises a restaurant Lol, two sentences before this you said "...he might technically be breaking tos." and then you continue to use the word "legitimate". I don't think you know what that word means. \&gt; And you're wrong. Paid promotions aren't always disclosed as promotions. More often then not, they aren't disclosed as being promotions. \_Again\_, that doesn't make it okay. If everyone breaks the law then it's not illegal I guess? Look up FTC Disclosure guidelines for Instagram...
The rambling mind of one who can't appreciate the work and creativity of another. It's isn't illegal to violate anyone's TOS (unless you consider state and federal law to be the TOS of the government.) He isn't abusing anything, he's saving money by using his skillset. If you can make your own bread and save yourself money, that doesn't mean you have a responsibility or obligation to open a nonprofit bakery for the homeless. You're argument is because he did something for himself, he's a bad person, which is utterly ridiculous. How is this guy harming anyone? Restaurants aren't going to use that marketing budget to feed people who can't afford it, that would be nonsense from a business standpoint. Ethically good? You mean like investing your time and effort to help promote and grow local businesses? I'd also like to point out he did give away some of the meals he got due to having so many responses. He didn't mention one way or another what his captions are for promotional posts, so you're assuming either way. He mentioned specifically in his article that when dealing with restaurants it was done manually. You're either not reading the article completely and jumping to conclusions, or making assumptions in order to falsely bolster your stance. If you're so concerned about the common good, put in the time and effort to do something similar for your town and give away the earnings to charity/homeless people/food kitchens instead of criticizing from your computer chair. He outlined everything for you, feel free to show us how it's done 'ethically good.'
We can agree to disagree. And when I said followers naturally, I meant that those people discovered the page and liked them out of interest naturally. That's what I meant by naturally. If you want to be a tos nazi then by all means. Personally I dont give a shit about tos if I don't feel like it's morally wrong. We have obvious disagreements on that. You aren't understanding what I'm saying either. You're taking what I'm saying far out of context and then using it to bash me. I said "if he legitimately advertises the restaurant" and you took it as something completely different. Unless I break everything down to you barney style you don't understand what I'm saying. I'm done here have a good one.
Amazing! Just wow!
I tried to explain the same thing. He doesn't understand. I said that he's legitimately advertising those companies. Maybe I should have said literally, not legitimately. His response was that it's not legitimate if it's breaking a tos. What I stated went over their head. What I meant was that if he is advertising a company and its working, as in the company sees a few extra guests that found him through that page, and he's getting a small compensation off that then that's all that matters.
Not gonna lie. &amp;#x200B; I'm slowly boarding the Rust train.
Everything being said is in the context of this Medium post, lol. I'm fine to disagree about the morality of all this and the abuse of Instagram's platform. I hate most social media platforms including Instagram/Facebook. But again, there's nothing "legitimate" about how he's advertising these restaurants and you can't seem to understand that.

Yeah, I don't expect him to comprehend, it's more of a setting the record straight. The fact that he thinks TOS are legally binding makes it clear that he won't listen to reason.
Again you're not understanding what I meant by that. We can agree to disagree.

Thanks!!
I never said that this wasn't creative or savvy. \&gt; Ethically good? You mean like investing your time and effort to help promote and grow local businesses? Yea, I'm sure he did this because he cares soooo much about promoting NYC restaurants. He did this for free food. The title of the post starts with "Eat For Free...", not "Grow A Business...". \&gt; He mentioned specifically in his article that when dealing with restaurants it was done manually. From the article: "Again, I automated my sales pitch too." "If I go into my account, I will see the message that it auto-generated and sent." "Finally, I have a script that monitors my inbox for any responses and alerts me if so. If there is a response, I finally do some manual work and negotiate with my potential client." Okay cool, so he automates 99% and then we he it's worth his effort because he can get free food, then he decides to intervene. Why bother at that point? \&gt; He didn't mention one way or another what his captions are for promotional posts, so you're assuming either way. I wonder why he doesn't mention that. He also doesn't post the link the actual Instagram page cause he knows it'll be targeted.
I understand that TOS are not legally binding. But as soon as you bring money into it, it \_can\_ become a legal issue as per FTC. &amp;#x200B; "The Guides themselves don’t have the force of law. However, practices inconsistent with the Guides may result in law enforcement actions alleging violations of the FTC Act. Law enforcement actions can result in orders requiring the defendants in the case to give up money they received from their violations and to abide by various requirements in the future." ([source](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/ftcs-endorsement-guides-what-people-are-asking))
The obvious thing to do is lift that out into a configurable variable. Alternatively, mock the value out to be the value provided by the tmpdir fixture (I'd do this through a fixture that uses the tmpdir fixture, mocks the value, and yields the mock)
Any specific reason for the switch?
Exactly. And I'm not saying that she deserves all of the credit since it is obviously impossible to know the intricacies of who contributed what, but making the insinuation that the guy who wrote all of matplotlib code is the real hero is just misguided.
wow she really did a lot https://i.imgur.com/Vjc0CBr.png
Yes, you should have said "literally" because that has a very different meaning. \&gt; "I said.....What I meant was...." Oh, okay so I'm just supposed to know when you mean something different than what you typed. \&gt; Imo the person commenting is just another toxic member of the community. I'm toxic because I decided to raise questions about the morality of this Medium post? In a field where ethics are going to determine the future of society and humanity? Cool, I'm glad we decided to go this direction with it...
Management material right there
Would you mind sharing your code? I've been having a ton of issues with the mlbgame api lol
I like it, but I have an i7, 32GB of RAM, an SSD and PyCharm is a resource hog. It freezes every so often for 10 seconds or so. I turned off spellcheck and most of the additions (SQL, Django, etc.). How do you make it usable?
I'm not responding to you anymore. Every one of your comments is overly passive aggressive. I'm here for python not to argue. Get lost.
Jesus christ man, python had a family
&gt;Yea, I'm sure he did this because he cares soooo much about promoting NYC restaurants. He did this for free food. The title of the post starts with "Eat For Free...", not "Grow A Business...". Regardless of his intent, that's what he's doing. You were stating he was causing harm, I pointed out his work has the opposite effect. I'm not sure whether you think intent overrides the action, or you're just trying knitpick so you don't have to change your stance. &gt; Okay cool, so he automates 99% and then we he it's worth his effort because he can get free food, then he decides to intervene. Why bother at that point? What's your argument here? That he should do everything by hand to 'earn it' more? By that logic, your car shouldn't have automatic transmission, power steering, or antilock brakes. When driving is that easy, why bother at that point? &gt;I wonder why he doesn't mention that. More assumptions. Perhaps he doesn't mention it for a few different reasons: * Each promo post is tailored to the individual client's specifications, so it wouldn't make sense to go over them all. * This is more of a informational article on the structure he used instead of a guide. * There are word limits on articles, and adding a couple lines about a generic disclaimer seems superfluous. Again, you're intentionally ignoring my point to try and make another for your stance. Will you at least acknowledge you are making assumptions to fit your opinion? &gt;He also doesn't post the link the actual Instagram page cause he knows it'll be targeted. Even more assumption. Perhaps it's against the media outlet policy to promote personal social media, or perhaps they wanted something for adding the link to his article. Maybe he doesn't want to let people directly rip off his account to spin it off for them. He doesn't want to add too much server activity to avoid having to pay AWS. You can't know his motivation, and so you make yet more leaps to serve your argument. Let's say it was because he'll be targeted. Wouldn't you do the same? I definitely wouldn't want people like you polluting my comment section with ridiculous statements to actively tear down something I worked hard to create. Perhaps you we referring to targeting from Instagram. He abided by all the guidelines in the API to make sure his scripts were legit. Why do you think they have a published API that let's you do all the things he is doing?
You're once again assuming the person who goes through all that wouldn't do his homework.

Are you familiar with how people lead software projects? Do team leads do all the commits? No. They architect the solution, guide, and develop their team. Is the contributor view of the repo revealing and indicate how much people put into the code base? Yes, but it doesn’t reveal everything and should be taken with a grain of salt without any other insight. I know we all just want everyone to get credit, and we *should* credit everyone with their fair share, but she’s been working on and contributing to the success of this project for over a decade.... oh yeah and she wrote [this](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/23f1/9469fd2d939e11e1830aee5d8bb809a8bca4.pdf) paper about exactly how the algorithm that creates the picture works. Does that mean she did everything on the project? No. But let’s be real. Nobody would be talking about EHT right now without her ground breaking work, dedication, and literal picture her algorithm generated from the EHT systems.
I think it's because there are comments hidden in more replies
Tried it Doesn't give all the comments in a post with too many comments
why? Is it like... Gross?
Is there any scientific work I can get knowing Python but having no degree?
Yeah, I think there might be juuuuust *a little* background required to grasp concepts here. Definitely written for colleagues in their field.
Imagine a library of code with hundreds of small modules each written by a different person, most of them scientists with minimal software dev background all curated and forced to run under a custom ipy terminal with its own santax.
Send me a PM on Friday and I’ll send it over. I’m going to be offline for the most part for the next two days.
There's something really pleasant about seeing the massive author list and number of collaborating institutions, across the planet, that contributed to this effort. People are capable of coming together and producing really astounding work when a common cause, in this case a desire to better understand our world, unites them.
As are all published research papers lol
Will do! Thanks.
what do you mean?
I want to write code for researchers to use I guess.
Saw an article saying C++ knocked Python out of the top three. I proceeded to not read the article.
fair.
Is there a college or university near you?
lol how does one person manage to suck so much?
Founder of Anaconda &amp; PyData here.. so proud that our software community contributed to this amazing result!
Thanks for your appreciation. Python is mostly fast enough for me too. But it still has its drawbacks especially in data processing. So I tend to extend it with Rust here and there when needed. In addition it was fun learning Rust too.
so yes then; it's gross.

Yay, it's always nice not to have to keep a million versions of the same thing installed.
I have added two new approaches to the problem 1. Extract the elements of the list as a key to the dictionary 2. Add a map (dict, in Python) to keep track of occurrences of the elements and remove elements with more than one occurrence. [https://github.com/devAmoghS/Practice-Problems/](https://github.com/devAmoghS/Practice-Problems/)
Several
Yes, I have updated the code now. Feel free to share your feedback on it :) &amp;#x200B; [https://github.com/devAmoghS/Practice-Problems/blob/master/quick\_sort.py](https://github.com/devAmoghS/Practice-Problems/blob/master/quick_sort.py)
Man this is cool, thanks for sharing.
Thanks everyone for your responses, I finally have a program I can use to write python code! I went with Anaconda.
Specifically CASA
Is this supposed to be an insult or a dig at her abilities?
It is, it's the Heat colormap too
Standard rule, read the abstract, read the conclusion, then work in from the ends to the extent one feels like.
I'm actually starting to learn the language at the moment.
Just watched this. Very helpful for people new to programming. I learned a lot from the clear explanations of everything. I’ll be checking out your other videos.
Email a professor and ask them
In our defense, we generally don't get time to do things that aren't directly science like, say, rewrite code to update it. It's just.... not valued as much as it should be.
I've tried but the only way I've been able to do it was with break. Here's an example of what I've tried. \# Yes is correct answer # for tries in range(3): x = str(input('Answer: ')) if x == 'yes': break
Scientists drink tea, can you make that?
Imagine thinking that number of commits and lines was an accurate measure of contribution.
[https://plone.org/](https://plone.org/) has most of what you want built in and lots of features baked-in (ftp, webdav, ldap).
There were a number of links shared in the chat. Is there a way to access those? The Youtube replay does not include any of those links in the description.
Answered in the video.
Jokes on you, this image was generated by python 3.
The notation "O(n)" or more generally "O(f(n))" has a specific meaning, just look it up in a CS or math textbook. In particular, if a function f is O(n) and g is O(n), then you can *prove* that f+g is also O(n). Likewise if f is O(n) and g is O(1), then you can prove that f+g is O(n). Also the quantity 2n+1 is O(n) and n is O(2n+1), but nobody in their sane mind would write O(2n+1).
I came here to comment that it must be amazing for people who contributed to these projects to see them being used like this! Props to you!
oof
I can make some bomb green tea with peach, or mango. Splash in a dash of rum. Oh yeah.
My professor from uni told me that for data sciences in the field of applied science R is primarily used...is that not right then?
Scientist in general are using a crap ton of Python.
I get to use Python at work.
Emacs. Definitely Emacs. Maybe with elpy
My entire bachelors thesis was only 200 lines of code. I got great marks, because those lines were hard. She wrote thousands. And python is really efficient in terms of lines of code. Also, she never claimed to be the most important person in the project.
Fuck you for tryint to knock down the work of a brilliant scientist. Go back to 4chan
If you can find the links to expand the replies in the html you could use something like selenium to load the web page, click all the links the expand the replies and then scrape the html
I sorta get your idea.
Imo wagtail's the best cms for django atm, and you've got the django advantage when writing your docs/gallery stuff - but obviously there's a hosting overhead for a django site which you may not want. Have you considered something like Hugo? Haven't used it myself but have heard it's great for this sort of thing.
Hugo is aimed at simpler static sites. Pelican does the same but is implemented in python.
It's working. Thanks!!
Or use something like docker if you need the old versions of something.
And they never care about PEP8.
In algorithm analysis it’s typically a worst-case approximation and so all about the order of the _most significant_ contributor to the time complexity of the algorithm. In an algorithm where all components are O(1) the overall algorithm is O(1)... an algorithm with 200 of the same 0(1) operations will be 200X slower than an algorithm with one of those operations, but the _complexity_ is O(1) because that’s the order of the most significant contributor. Both algorithms will return in some _constant_ amount of time whether n contains few values or many. Introduce a single O(n) operation though and it dominates all the others in contributing to the growth rate of the algorithm, so the algorithm is O(n). And again compare 200 O(n) operation to 1 and you’ll get a constant 200X increase in time cost for any fixed value of n, but as n moves from few to many the run time cost of both algorithms will grow at a _linear_ rate. So the back of the hand approach is find the highest order operation and you’ve found the order of the entire algorithm.
Always a good idea when needing legacy stuff
``` from blackhole import take_picture ```
Sorry mate, missed this msg. When I say not for beginners, I'm thinking mainly in the programming aspects. I assume most of us here have some high school physics knowledge so the courses above should be easy at that point. In all the courses, none ever went too deep into Deep Learning, except for in brief comments in Rajeev's course. The others often mention things but don't go into detail. &amp;#x200B; Honestly, if ur a total noob, learning CV is kinda hard. But definitely not impossible. Start with a simple OpenCV Python course
Its a really nice language to just know and be able to do some stuff with.
Have the script click every 'View more comments' button on the page, then scrape
Be real, he wrote 850.000 lines of code. That's no easy feat.
Contribute to open source! That way it will be used not just by scientists, but by anyone who does numerical work in python! numpy / scipy / pandas are pretty mature, but there is loads to be done on xarray and dask, both of which are used heavily by scientists.

Showing the image when you run "import gravity" would be a very nice easter egg for Python 3.8 or 3.9 !
This is about as far as I would have got
thank,i not select interpreter. but i can use python extention. is this bad for intelisense?
We tend mostly to write our own stuff. Coding is a huge part of my research and since a lot of it is data exploration and analysis, I don't know what I would hand off to someone without a background in it. That said, a lot of big collaborations create data pipelines for telescopes etc. They often struggle with needing scientists to essentially do technical work full time rather than science. You could investigate jobs with those but with no science background at all, I'd imagine you would struggle.
The other people are actually using C++ instead, and are still writing the code!
Hi Nowadays ima focusing on some mini-projects related to ethical hacking, I did a small brute force password cracker (cracks FTP Server password), It worked in a small test. Also, I created a post scanner using nmap.
is there a difference between 2.8 and 2.79? I can't seem to set size argument
Depends on your level of knowledge in Python. If you’re talented enough, find some researchers doing work you’re interested in and see if the project is open source. If it is try and work on it. If you want it to be a paid gig or full time job you’ll need a degree unless you’re insanely talented.
I want a pep that defines a formal method for listing all the monty python references in python.

Didn't really read the survey but the statement you quoted doesn't assume that by not using testing frameworks they aren't testing their code. They're saying that 35% aren't using testing frameworks AND aren't doing any testing. At least that's how it's worded.
- Small image of the product - it's price - it's characteristics Using scrapy, BS4, requests atm. Once again, still a learner here :)
\_\_init\_\_ not init.
Fuck you for trying to parade some dumb cunt in the name of equality, when it was nothing special and any dumb lab assistant could do it.
at least \`\`import antigravity\`\` works!
It's already _init_ there mate, reddit rewrite the code and no idea why it''s 'init' no '_init_'
GG
1. /r/learnpython 2. It's not an error, it's a warning 3. It tells you exactly what to do
😂😂😂👍👍👍
? I read them as *implying* that the 35% that don't use frameworks also do not test - which is not necessarily the case.
Well, I dunno man, works when I try it. class Animal: def __init__(self, name): self.name = name def speak(self): raise NotImplementedError('subclass must implement this method') class Dog(Animal): def speak(self): return self.name + " whofff" fido = Dog("Fido") fido.speak() `Fido whofff'
Stay away from the discussion, it will leave you with more questions than answers. ;)
Yeah we have arrived at the convention that you shouldn't use comprehensions for anything that would exceed one line. Speed wise, there is really no difference between a good old fashioned loop and a comprehension - it's mainly readability. The `filtered_squares` dict comprehension above looks way too complex for what it does, IMO. There is no point in forcing the usage of these just because you can, so use 'em wisely!
To be fair, we tend to mostly use what's already been written for us by non-scientists. :) Where would we be without the people who built the languages and libraries?
1. /r/learnpython 2. Do you have the Oracle client libraries installed on your computer? That is, Oracle Instant Client, not just cx_Oracle.
So you mean that even if I want to connect to my company's corporate Oracle Database Instance, I still need to install the Oracle Instant Client in my local machine / laptop ?
Very slick. Putting on my academic hat, does theta not have units? If it's an angle you're using, calling out deg or rad is important (unless your field always uses whatever units and it's understood). I greatly appreciate anyone who thinks about us colorblind folks, though. Or about those who like printing in grayscale!
Yes.
Watching the Fyre Festival documentary on Netflix ignited more disgust in me for influencer culture than I could have ever anticipated.

Thanks for the reply. I am reading on that now.
Dayum.
I just wanted to mention that Katie Bouman did *not* lead the creation of the new algorithm. She contributed a minor part of it, but the dominant majority was created and developed by Japanese resesarchers.
Damn if I had a 100 more coins I would have gilded you
Excellent, thanks for the info.
It's double underscore...single would be treated as italics
Japanese researchers actually
You have single underscores around the word init. It needs to be double
Exactly what I was going to say. Not a lecturer but someone doing research.
You are 100% right about using radians. My advisor liked to let theta to take values proportional to the period, but really it should be rescaled since it's a phase angle. Thanks for pointing that out!
that's a damn elegant one-liner, man I love python
Yeah I just re-read it. You're right. My bad
Ha true!
Uh, a few years back I've had little to no success using pytesseract. I was working on a little something for Runescape back and decided to take a "ghetto approach". What I did was basically prepare images of all the letters and numbers and used those to go though cropped and modified images with phrases from the game, a little bit of template matching and I was done.
thanks so much, works
thanks dude
Will check it out! Really want to get into it but I find most beginner or learner material is like: step one, import tensor flow, step two multiply your multidimensional array by the bias of the third delta in the transient arc of the rotation of the sun on a summers day Step three, lets plot that and print the result :)
Agreed! But, I have tried to deliver complex concepts in the simplest way possible. For example, a topic like AUC - ROC curves which a lot of beginners find it difficult to understand, I have created a really helpful video for it -&gt; [https://youtu.be/mUMd\_cKU0VM](https://youtu.be/mUMd_cKU0VM)
Fuck you for trying to put this bitch on a pedestal while the real scientists are forgotten in the background, just go away.
Dude you are amazing at this stuff, we need more people like you in the games industry.

&gt; Testing doesn't require a framework, or require a named framework. Some of those "named frameworks" are the language built-ins, like unittest and mock. I'm open to what you are saying could be true, but can you elaborate as to how someone is testing if they aren't using even the language standards? Do you mean something specifically? like manually testing it? or are you saying there are other mechanisms to create code tests?
Certainly, I had the opportunity to work with Deep Space Network data last summer. I rewrote a ton of post processing scripts utilizing a multiprocessing library to speed up the calculations. To give an idea a days worth of data was around 10 terabytes.

Thanks for the update! I'll make sure to check them changes out.
Learned Pythin whilst doing my Physics with Astronomy degree. It's def the standard in the field now and I'm so thankful for being forced to learn it.
Hey! This is great. I’m a civil engineering student in Argentina that’s trying to learn Python. So far I’m going through Automating the Boring Stuff and trying to do small projects to start learning how to manage files, names, etc. but I’m more interested in replacing MatLab and Mathematica with it. Do you have any pointers from where to go after finishing AtBS? Is it knowing python a plus in the industry in Argentina?
Props for the design... I know how difficult it is to create a beautiful website and yours definitely is.
Hi, there are those that don't do *unit* testing, but do test. Some can place scripts in-situ and exercise the greater system off-line, for example;
"real scientists" lmao wtf
What was your bachelors thesis about?
Yeah, design is very difficult for any developer. Thanks for your words!
I started doing basic things. At first it was a disaster, a horrible code. Then I learned how to organize and refactor it. For me, the best way to learn is to start a project that interests you. That will keep you motivated. There are two more advanced books that helped me a lot: [Python Cookbook](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-cookbook-3rd/9781449357337/) [Fluent Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python/9781491946237/) For videos check Corey Schafer in Youtube.
How do I loop through all messages in a discord channel can anyone help me?
Don’t give money to Reddit lol
Github is kinda, neutral for job stuff. It means more if it's the main thing that you have. If I was to make it a pillar of my job hunting strategy I would go whole hog on the 'extras.' Unit tests, good documentation, autopep8/pylint, etc. Show that even if you're building a stupid reddit bot you can do all the important bits that are easy to overlook but can be key to writing good software.
A Japanese guy wrote the algorithm.
I am using a static site generator now that is written in python and uses jinja2 for templating (Lektor). I am ready to move beyond a static site though. It's nice, it's fast, it's secure... But in the end, I think I just want a bit more. &amp;#x200B; Inre: hosting overhead -- I'm okay with that. I'm a sysadmin with a lot of VPSs sitting around, and I am comfortable self hosting. It's a good consideration for a lot of people though, especially because a lot of shared hosts don't support Python apps
I have used Plone a fair bit at $dayjob. The functionality is great, but speed and resource usage are both fairly large issues IMO.

I believe it's not that times are gone for honest men, rather the majority of science people went full idiocracy after Youtube and Instagram messed with their minds.
The most important thing (according to a relative of mine who is in the hiring department at AWS) is that you have a problem and wrote a solution to it. They're looking for people who are motivated and good problem solvers, so any project or projects that reflect that would look pretty good on your resume.

Go to hackathons and put those on your resume as experience if you are proud of what you did.
Thanks again. I did what you said and read a few things and now I am able to connect the work database fine.
I will check it ty !
While starting out a channel on AI, ML or DL, I would advice you to first decide whats your target audience going to be. The reason I state this is because there is another youtuber, Siraj Raval (I am sure you must have heard about him) seems to be completely confused. His videos are certainly good for any total beginner but I feel that his videos dont have any "juice" in them. You may want to check out [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/6n97my/what_do_you_guys_think_about_siraj_ravals_videos/) subreddit.
&gt; unlike in MATLAB I am rarely left without any idea how I am supposed to do something due to critical aspects being either undocumented or the required documentation being hard to track down. Wow, a radically different experience, I see. I do not remember undocumented aspects of Matlab, not at all. There were other things that drove me nuts about Matlab, like the namespace, but certainly not the documentation. Can you make a couple of examples? Eg of undocumented stuff in Matlab, of bugs you found, of stuff better documented in Python etc? I am wondering if this changes a lot from area to area - e.g. one area is better documented in Matlab, another in Python.
Run the test inside the docker, expected failure or skip if the folder doesn't exist
I wrote a logistic system for my company over the last 5 months. It's a giant success and now my higher ups are pushing for promoting me and leading global deployment of this system. Tools for those curious: python 3.7, Flask webapp for dashboard reporting, and a MSSQl database for the backend
I have uploaded around 65 videos so far &amp; my aim has been to deliver a concept in simple language while maintaining a balance of mathematics &amp; hands on python code! Thanks for the links &amp; suggestions :)
Works great!
There’s something wrong with the YouTube link, brings an error when I try to play it
&gt; mass media spin Which was?
Any details on the tool? I have dabbled with the idea of something like that for the NHL API but simply throwing keywords at the server and recording the response codes seemed kind of noisy and rude so I am curious how you approached it?
I really got into it when I started making little text games like rock paper scissors in python.
Am I the only one who read this as resume (continue) worthy python projects?

As others have said, use Selenium to continually click the "load more comments" buttons on the page until they have all been clicked. Then use beautiful soup to parse the page.
Lol what a useless tutorial.
Such a beautiful page! How did you make the front end? You should post this on /r/learnpython they would love it.
Even though IDL has a lot of similarities to python, I hated having to use it for my college astro work. So glad things are moving away from it, so that researchers can be more productive.
Thanks!
Looking for my next kaggle competition. Working on my machine learning skills.
First, did you know there is an entire site dedicated to [undocumented stuff in MATLAB](https://undocumentedmatlab.com/)? There is a ton of stuff on there. But for stuff that is poorly or incorrectly documented, let me give you some examples. According to the documentation of [save](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/save.html) &gt; save(filename,variables,'-append') adds new variables to an existing file. *If a variable already exists in a MAT-file, then save overwrites it with the value in the workspace.* The part in italics is a **lie**. It does not overwrite it, it saves *both*. You can no longer access the old version, but it is still taking up space in the file. That means if you "overwrite" a variable repeatedly, your file will just keep growing and growing and growing. This has been known since at least [2014](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/129794-why-does-save-append-work-so-slow-and-increase-the-size-of-mat-file-for-simple-replacement). For what should be something easy, lets say I want to do something when MATLAB closes my figure. Knowing MATLAB, that should be a callback, so lets check the callback information. I find this: [DeleteFcn](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/matlab.ui.figure-properties.html). Great. Looks like what I need. So what should the arguments to the callback function be? It doesn't say. There is a [link](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/creating_guis/write-callbacks-using-the-programmatic-workflow.html), let's follow that. It has the arguments for `pushbutton_callback`, but it doesn't say if those are the same, nor does it tell you what `src` or `event` are. I assume `src` is the object, but I have no clue what `event` is. Let's search for `DeleteFcn`. No documentation for the callback itself, but there is [Define an Object Deletion Callback](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/creating_plots/define-an-object-deletion-callback.html). Maybe that has it? Nope, not even close. I eventually search for "callback arguments" where I at least get the [purpose of the arguments](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/creating_plots/callback-definition.html), but I still to this day do not know how to find out what the contents of `eventdata` are without setting a breakpoint and checking by hand. I have never had to set a breakpoint in Python just to figure out what a basic language feature actually does. To give you an example of a flat-out poorly-documented function, try [audioDeviceWriter](https://www.mathworks.com/help/audio/ref/audiodevicewriter-system-object.html). Is this blocking? What if you send more or less than one buffer length of audio? What happens if you overfill the buffer? What happens if you set an invalid sampling rate? I would like to think that MATLAB will raise an error if you do something stupid, but I have seen MATLAB too often silently ignore error conditions to trust that. There is just not enough information there to actually use reliably without a lot of trial-and-error. Compare that to the documentation of [playrec](http://www.playrec.co.uk/documentation.html), which is a third-party MATLAB tool. It may not have the nice examples, but unlike with MATLAB it explains what everything does. And the documentation of the Python version of playrec, [`sounddevice`](https://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.io/), is much more detailed and has much better examples.
Lol! I read it the same way. Actually peaked my interest to read the post because of it.

I’ve been trying to read text from games (rainbow six siege more specifically), as well in a project of mine, it seems to be pretty difficult because of the different backgrounds, but after a lot of research and a lot of hours trying I’ve been able to get to something. Heres a [link](https://github.com/freddy-d/textOCR) to my github take a look at it. If you have any questions let me know.. also I’ve used a difflib function (get_close_matches) to try and approximate my ocr result to the words I really want, it is a good way of getting more accurate answers. In my case it works since I only want to read names that I already know what they could be.
Now I REALLY think we need a pep to define the level of monty python in a python product.
Makes me think, could Terry Jones call on Article 17 for stuff like this?
Features for abstraction that are easier to implement and manage than Python implementations (Structs, Traits). Having a work around for null values is far more valuable than I gave it credit for. It's kinda like Python and C++ had a kid.
Dang, 850K lines and no mention? That's no good. Was Bouman in charge of the whole effort, at least?
That's the same picture of him on his screen. Infinite nude programmer dude!
Is there an English printing? Because I need this book.

FKK-Kultur checks out.
lol i saw that and was like "man i better check this out, what's it about?"
Cannot. Unsee.
Isn´t that Sasha Baron Cohen?
Is this a real thing, and if so why is there a naked person on a programming book? (*) Naked except for a collar.
I can't help but notice that contributer achael wrote 850,275 lines of the code of the program that Katie Bouman (klbouman), who wrote 2,410, supposedly created.
WOW! Pretty cool!. Congrats.
The tool is heavily customized for how the NBA Stats website operates. Unfortunately, it would not be possible to use it with another API source unless it mirrors NBA Stats exactly.
There is no doubt about it, it's spin. "He is the author of the eht-imaging software library which is used across the collaboration for analyzing data and generating images."

Sex sells?
The orange bubble says "No prior knowledge required" I'm assuming that's the connection. Starting from nothing like you're born.
Thanks!
its a reference to a monthy python meme (naked organist)
It's a sequel of the first book in the "A Pocketful of Python" series.
Lol, I even have the book. But now, for something completely different...
A naked person playing an organ appeared in Monty Python's Flying Circus a lot.
German. What a surprise...
Beyond just personal projects contributing to an existing project and working within their various conditions shows that you can adapt to an existing system and function within it which is a very good trait to have from an employers perspective.
stop it. a whole lot of scientists achieved something great. none of those people are doing it media attention or internet-points. nothing good can come out of this and all the other posts about "lines of code" and who "really" contributed. let it rest keyboard-warriors.
As long as the scale ends at Full Monty. Perhaps 0 can be "not a witch"
Always heard from others that this book company produces books for people who are desperately searching for a book about a given topic, but lack the technical depth and are even wrong in som places (the books). So there is further proof that this company is somehow shady.

Even for someone like me who has never touched Django (I do have basic knowledge of python), this tutorial is easy to understand. I am still learning the basics of angular and back end on asp.net but defenetly gonna save this post and try it in couple of weeks
My experience has been that that is most sellers of tech books.
It's weird for us too.
I will do things like that but then move to more complex games, (space invaders, snake, etc), I am not sure if they will have the capability to understand. how old are you?

Could probably just use CentOS. I think version 1 is the newest one they have.
I haven't played with the NBA API in awhile because the last good package was nba_py, but it hasn't been updated/maintained in YEARS. So thank you for this, I really look forward to using this! Hopefully if I get something cool done with this in the future I can push some users your way!
This is string edit distance, or Levenstein dictance. Here’s an implementation in a python package: https://rawgit.com/ztane/python-Levenshtein/master/docs/Levenshtein.html#Levenshtein-distance

This would be used in Monty Python's Flying Circus as a link between sketches with the tag line "And now for something completely different..." Python was so named because Theo was a fan.
another one bites the dust yeah!
Thanks for your correction. I was out of my mind when I typed this.
That's going to be hard to unsee.
def say_sth_useless(): sth = "This is how we code in Germany." print(sth) say_sth_useless()

Luckily he did an”import collar” and then classed it up with fancy
"No previous knowledge necessary". But... I DO want to know why they chose this cover and I want to know it BEFORE I buy the book!
The German equivalent to the packt books.
Facebook, especially Instagram, uses a lot of *modern* Python.
omg, thank you, looks like the magical preprocessing did the trick, now to move on to the finish times and lap times, which will hopefully as doable as the names. Thanks again!
I just distrust any tech book under 700 pages.
You’re very welcome, hit me up if you have any questions....
We are finally generating nude Taynes in Python.
And now for something completely different...
I'd drop letters one by one from the longer word to see if result matches the shorter one
I distrust most tech book OVER 700 pages, because they are usually just regurgitated reference manuals.
Do something interesting, that fills a need you have. What's your favorite radio station? Do they have a website? Does it have an API? A lot of them do. Scrape the data and write a GTK frontend that displays the currently-playing song. Click on the song to load it on YouTube using VLC and Streamlink. Or cast it to your Chromecast with CATT. Write a funny Reddit bot with PRAW. Search for every time someone says the word "inconceivable" and reply "I do not think hat word means what you think it means" with a bot named Vizzini-Bot. Write a cool, small video game, that you wish existed but doesn't. Make a networked version with websockets and serve it with tornado. Do something funny, with personality, that's a neat idea, that hasn't been done before. Doesn't have to be practical or even useful. But it should make the person reviewing your resume smile, and be a tiny bit impressed.
Man you nailed it 👶
It's not infinite. In Python it is just 'maximum recursion depth reached nudeness'
&gt; I was out of my clothes when I typed this. Fixed it for you.
FKK Python? - just the motivation I needed.
Please do! The more the merrier. And I find a lot of fulfillment when I see people using it. :D
I'm going to learn whatever language that is so that I can buy it.
How it feels like to code in Python.
nice!
just a little. =]

He isn't removing food from anyone's mouths. Period. He's getting food, and giving food, from restaurants that want (and get!) a positive review. End of story. He simply made a way to do so, much easier than manual methods.
You might need to explicitly tell webdriver.Chrome where the the chromedriver is located on your computer. I've only use selenium a few times, but when I have I had to set it up like this: browser = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='&lt;path to chromedriver&gt;', chrome_options=option)
And in this instalment, to which pocket might they be referring??? 🤔
*gestures broadly* Germans!
If you’re looking for text similarity, there is also a package called FuzzyWuzzy (https://pypi.org/project/fuzzywuzzy/0.3.0/) [tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/fuzzy-string-python).
To think it was that simple
I’d drop letters from both ends (loop over by index) for BOTH strings until mismatches are found, and if you end up with one character on the longer string, winner.
Nude Tayne
It's weird because there is no beer
im a data engineer by trade... we use python and just scale out... what kinds of work loads does that not work for? like real time image recognition for like missile defense or automated cars... seem like some edge cases... but most data processing can be done in parallel
The full one.
 In [1]: import numpy as np In [2]: a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]]) In [3]: a.repeat(2,axis=0).repeat(2,axis=1) Out[3]: array([[1, 1, 2, 2], [1, 1, 2, 2], [3, 3, 4, 4], [3, 3, 4, 4]])
 In [4]: np.kron(a, np.ones((2, 2))) Out[4]: array([[1., 1., 2., 2.], [1., 1., 2., 2.], [3., 3., 4., 4.], [3., 3., 4., 4.]])
That's just great! Can you make a high resolution scan of the cover by any chance? I need it, for things, you know
The same reason numpy was written in C and fortran and Tensorflow was written in C++. Some workloads are too heavy for python. Unless you opt in to use 20 instances running for 2 days rather than running in single instance in an hour using C++/C.(Some workloads scale so badly due to network shuffles). How do you process 500 GB text file in python for non trivial requirement? In addition not everyone can afford resources. I already made a slightly shabby case regarding this. But the essence is same. Give it a read if you would like it. [https://medium.com/@rajasekar3eg/making-a-case-rust-for-python-developers-1a114e2d89f4](https://medium.com/@rajasekar3eg/making-a-case-rust-for-python-developers-1a114e2d89f4) The following is also an excellent article from an author experienced in building efficient distributed systems and the author of amazing project called timely-dataflow. [http://www.frankmcsherry.org/graph/scalability/cost/2015/01/15/COST.html](http://www.frankmcsherry.org/graph/scalability/cost/2015/01/15/COST.html)
Holy fuck. You're self aware? What about the scheisse videos that Cartman's mom are in. Is that a real thing?
I'm making a web game based on the gameshow Google Trends from Funhaus using pytrends. There is a term that two teams have to pair with another term and the combined term with the highest trend score wins. Think it will be cool. Currently struggling to find a good way to generate a pool of words to choose as prompts. Started using a dictionary dump as a starter but there's so many words that are either boring or that doesnt really work well with the game. Anyone have any ideas? Thinking I could try and use some list of trending google searches.
Thanks! I knew there had to be a simple way to do this.
And now for something completely different.
The OP of this thread seems to be pushing a narrative that Dr. Katherine Bouman didn't have much to do with the actual work involved in this project, and that her contribution is "media spin". It is of the utmost importance that anyone reading this understand that the OP is completely incorrect for a variety of reasons. **Dr. Bouman wrote her thesis on “Extreme Imaging via Physical Model Inversion: Seeing Around Corners and Imaging Black Holes”.** It was her primary research leading to her PhD, which she complete at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. MIT does not award PhDs to people who did not do the bulk of their work; the process to graduate is rigorous. **The development of the algorithm is not necessarily the implementation of that algorithm in code.** While Dr. Bouman developed the algorithm, it should not be surprising that she was not necessarily the one to implement it in Python. There are lots of reasons why she might not have done so. **The number of lines of code that one writes for a project is not indicative of the contribution that one has made to the project**. This is obvious to anyone who works at a level beyond that of a complete beginner; developers often rail about how "lines of code" is not an effective indicator of how much work someone has done, and there have been lots of threads here and in other place on reddit to game this system. **Post Doctoral Fellows or Professors are frequently recognized as a primary when they have collaborated on with students.** This does not mean that the post doc or prof did not participate, or have a huge influence on the project. **A large number of Andrew Chael's commtits were not actual code.** I had a look at [this link](https://np.reddit.com/r/quityourbullshit/comments/bbx2yi/guy_misinterpret_github_to_make_it_look_like/) and then looked at the repository and it's pretty spot on. ----- I'm going to leave this up, because Andrew Chael is an awesome guy doing awesome work, and he deserves congratulations! It's notable that he has also received [the Eric Keto award](https://bhi.fas.harvard.edu/news/congratulations-andrew-chael) this week, which is super impressive.
&gt;"He is the author of the eht-imaging software library which is used across the collaboration for analyzing data and generating images." (From his Harvard "Black Hole Initiative" profile, here: &gt; &gt;https://bhi.fas.harvard.edu/people/andrew-chael &gt; &gt;)
It's a perfect intro to recursion.
Who on earth thought this would be a good idea? Who approved it to be published?
Eh but depends if he's good or not… if he needs to be tutored to write the code, it could be faster for them to just do it themselves instead. And write bad code like all people in research.
Amazing! thank you!
Probably because he’s seated at a “keyboard,” like the keyboard of an organ
I’m really excited to play with this this summer!
numpy.matlib.repmat does exactly what you're asking for
I personally cannot listen tutorial videos with bad audio - at least try to find a room with more stuff like bookcases in it. Or get some acoustic absorption panels. The reflections from the glass wall in your introductory video drown your voice.
If every anybody needed to go to r/learnpython, it's you. That's the sub for the very basics.
Writing control system code. Low level fixed point C. The core of it was actually 3 lines. Most of the rest of the code was just smoothing out noise in the inputs. (Which in a fixed point, highly constrained processor is super tricky.)
Ah yeah, of course - for some reason I had it in my head it was a python project. Clue is in the name!
So far i have mostly been in large data that was funded so we did mot in python. &amp;#x200B; That article makes rust look cool. &amp;#x200B; i am just starting my start up, [http://www.magyk.cloud/](http://www.magyk.cloud/) &amp;#x200B; transnational maria db, - python based rest - angluar; and then once we really get going i hope to use snowflake for warehouse.... I look forward to having a large pile of data to do analytics on... and maybe i can pick up some rust tricks to run the numbers.... all three articles are pretty cool.
So do you prefer English or German South Park? It tripped me out how different they sound, though I guess I should have figured.
I work for [Vivint](https://vivint.com) on the Embedded Devices team, and we're strictly Python programmers. It's a lot of fun!
Ah makes sense. Main reason to go with something new for a personal site would be to learn something else. Async things like starlette look interesting, and then there's the whole js side of things with gatsby etc. But if you just want to get it done, personally I'd go django with wagtail - solid and reliable.
&gt;It is not bad now with Twilio
You can start with install Ubuntu :P
I am glad you liked it. It's pretty cool that you are starting your own startup. I am also trying my hands in entrepreneurship but finding good clients seems to be really challenging. Best of luck for you.

Wow, that's really interesting. Thank you for the clarification. My experience was different, but it was also many many many years ago, so my recollection may be imprecise, or my use back then more limited etc. There have been many times when frustration with Python's docs made me think: ah, this is one of those occasions where a commercial software would have had better documentation but you have shown that's not always the case - so I guess my decision to stick with Python wasn't too bad after all!
That image is from the cover of the Python supplement to the May 2000 issue of Linux Journal magazine.

I followed your advice. I created a Dockerfile &amp; copied my code &amp; tests and executed it like this: &gt; docker run -it --rm tester:latest /home/someone/testrunner.py It worked nicely. You are a champ!

Adding citations: [1] [**Dr. Bouman's PhD Thesis, issued in 2017**](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/113998#files-area). Her thesis focuses on two problems: imaging and image reconstruction from multiple sources to generate an imaging telescope approximately the size of earth and "Seeing around corners" (I have yet to read the full thesis so this will be misrepresented, I'll try my best to give a faithful description, but it is honestly somewhat beyond me) By seeing around corners it looks like she means taking advantage of how objects past an obstruction reflect light, some of which falls on the ground past the obstruction and as such is visible by the observer, imparting information about the source object. Using a variety of algorithms you can start reconstructing an estimation of the objects past an obstruction. (Also this thesis goes over applications of a lot of common algorithms in signals and sensing applications, and looks like it does a solid evaluation of those applications. If you're interested in that sort of thing, this might be worth reading in more detail--it's been added to my reading list) [2] [**Scaling code from development to production requires different skills**](https://blog.algorithmia.com/deploying-machine-learning-at-scale/) (this is less of an official citation but a good external reference talking about issues of deployment at scale) [3] **Github Mess** Ok this shouldn't be called a 'mess' but when people try to twist celebrations into some ham-fisted commentary on social politics it turns into a mess. The post in isolation doesn't quite do that, but op's recent comment history shows a clear agenda. Following through the [closed issues on github](https://github.com/achael/eht-imaging/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed), user klbouman (Dr. Bouman) and user achael (Andrew Chael) both demonstrate a strong knowledge of the codebase when answering questions, indicating that they both worked closely and heavily on the project. Further, OP attempting to push an agenda is highlighted by the lack of acknowledgement of the other key contributors on this team. If we're only going by github contributions (A terrible metric) then users michaeldjohnson and chanchikwan also deserve mention. In fact, we should expand our scope to more code projects, but this gets even messier because they're a huge organization with tons of contributors. [4] [**Andrew Chael took the picture of Dr. Bouman seeing the black hole**](https://twitter.com/thisgreyspirit/status/1116080207587434497) They're a team and worked together closely. They're both fucking awesome scientists, as I'm sure are the rest of the team. This whole event is a cause for celebration. At this point I notice OP has deleted his post, so the time I spent creating a more well cited response is mildly wasted, but I still prefer having citations present so here it is.
You could use a Raspberry Pi to interface with the robot I would suggest you learn the basics of Linux if you are doing that or you could learn to use Arduino which uses C or C++.
I hope MacOS removes python2 or include python3 as a default. There is nothing to justify pythin2 to be default on 2019.
did they have to use CUDA or anything like that for this?
No joke I found a video one day of a nun and priest doing sheisse essen, script pretty much this: "Esse den Scheisse Schwester" (eat the shit sister) "Oh ja" "Oh mein Gott" (oh my god) It had to be German.
It belongs in german
anaconda on the mac can change the system default to 3
Those are beautiful citations and I appreciate that you left them. I should have taken the time.

\[Library Request\] I'd interested in getting into Python. I code mostly in Scala, and one thing I love to do when I program in Scala is use one of these libraries I wrote for clickable "hyperlink" print and log statements: \- [https://github.com/JohnReedLOL/pos](https://github.com/JohnReedLOL/pos) \- [https://github.com/JohnReedLOL/scala-trace-debug](https://github.com/JohnReedLOL/scala-trace-debug) Or I can use this: \- [https://github.com/lihaoyi/sourcecode](https://github.com/lihaoyi/sourcecode) The reason I almost always use this is because I am very slow when it comes to "grep". Since I have a poor short-term memory, I basically end up looking up grep command flags, doing "Ctrl + R" \[to look up an old grep command that I used before\], and getting distracted every time I have to do "grep", so I find that using this library really speeds things up for me, especially when the line numbers and file names are formatted like a stack trace so that the IDE can create a "hyperlink" to the sourcecode. Basically, I spend a lot of time looking for which print statement corresponds to which line of code when I don't have this library. Do you have anything like this in Python? Can someone write something like this for me? The presence or absence of clickable stack traces is a big deal for me. \- John
No, but I'm new to python. I'm not too sure how to do it
geez. if you'd found this earlier it wouldn't have taken python ~20 to become a "big-lang". coulda been "big-lang" in the java era.
Oh lord, the "Python For Finance" book from Packt (not to be confused with the book of the same title from O'Reilly) is horrendous. The author confesses to not being a programmer; no problem. But he then goes on to recommend this system of debugging programs: &gt;Here is the logic behind this comment-all-out method: type all the lines &gt;and then comment them all. After that, we release one line at a time to &gt;debug. !!!! Uncomment one line, run, uncomment second line, run, etc. Madness.

There are 3 judges and the only one I know about is a previous student (he's in his 60's) who owned multiple software companies, so he's well versed in the world of software, programming, tech, etc. The others are unknown (probably to prevent bias or whatever)
A good Python IDE will enable you to click an error in the output and jump to source. They also incorporate debuggers that will enable you to step through a program a line at a time and examine the values of variables. I think it is a better alternative to put print statements everwhere and then remembering to have to remove them.

Switch to Django and packages for each auth method
First I think you are out of the subject related, second all languages are genarly propose, but the difference between performance, learning curve, fast to deploy, fast of compile, etc, are the things you keep in mind when you choose a language for a type of app or an arquitecture, in the case of php and python we are talking about web development, so now the real questions is about frameworks, why django, flask, or tornado are better than spring, or laravel for creating MVC, or rest for a particular kind of web App a CMS.

Actually, South Park is one of the few shows where the German dubbing is really good. I prefer the original version, simply because it's the original, but the German one is - I would say - just as good.
I really enjoyed working with https://wagtail.io, it have a lot of approaches using the django MVT, and also have an API rest, unfortunately the cms admin is pretty much difficult to change the behavior and styles, son if you want to costume for your own brand you will have a lot of work. I also know that django-cms is very popular and big companies like nasa used too. https://www.django-cms.org/en/ You also have a enterprise solutions like odoo ERP https://www.odoo.com/es_ES/ And one of the most famous app before Google buyed was YouTube in the beginning it was builded in python's frameworks

**Pleonasm** Pleonasm (; from Ancient Greek πλεονασμός, pleonasmós, from πλέον, pleon, meaning 'more; too much') is the use of more words or parts of words than are necessary or sufficient for clear expression: for example black darkness or burning fire. Such redundancy is, by traditional rhetorical criteria, a manifestation of tautology, and might be considered a fault of style. However, pleonasm may also be used for emphasis, or because the phrase has already become established in a certain form. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
This is what I get for fast scanning titles in my feed. I thought it said “best python book... ever.” Now my wife is giving me the side-eye
Sounds awesome
Thank you. You addressed this post as misleading right away, and provided accurate reasons behind why it was misleading. I'd say that's an appropriate/the correct response, especially considering how important a quick response is to these kinds of post and how much time it takes to go through everything and organize it all. I just wanted to leverage your response with more in depth citations. Besides, it gave me a shortlist of new research to read and I'm always happy with that!
Usually all graphical stuff is done by a graphics toolkit like qt or gtk. There are some good tutorials out there, but I wouldn't recommend to leran those right after getting into python.
Thank you for the suggestion. I have updated the post. Let me know if the code is readable now ?
At the very least, don't escape your spaces - you don't need that in a Python string.

Hold on a second, it's python not Python. Maybe get that clear before further discussion :)
I don't think it is. Only in the logo.

Big experiments can use crazy amounts of data. I guess that’s why magnetic tape is still popular in some circles.
Well I was way off. Guess I should watch some more Monty Python then
no idea about the source but I have seen many projects were privates are abused. Some organisations check on it during code review but usually with new developers this is not strictly followed. So it comes down to having guidelines and good code reviewers.
This means the xml path is wrong

Cheers mate!
This does not fit with the philosophy of Python. You don't try to "hide" your attributes. &amp;#x200B; There's always someone who needs to correct or enhance the private attributes and that only leads to bad integration. Keep it open and allow the other developers to enhance your code. &amp;#x200B; The closest thing next to "private" is the usage of the leading underscore, but it's only a naming convention and there is no technical limitation.
Where was this taken?
Django as an authentication server. Django all auth module for different types of authencation and oauth2/oidc for API/app authentication is great.
Perfekt
Yes, the source is certainly legitimate, if opinionated (and not everyone would agree with _all_ of those opinions); it was started by Kenneth Reitz, a very well known and well respected (if, again, opinionated) Python developer, and has been around for years. Overall it’s a very good summary of best practices, if _a little_ weighted towards one point of view. Now, _privacy_; it turns out that in practical reality the “lack” of this has almost no practical impact. If you’re relatively conservative in your code and preface functions and methods with a single underscore _unless_ they form a part of the public API of your package / module / class, you’ll find that anyone that doesn’t want to shoot themselves in the foot will simply respect that. If they don’t, then it tends to indicate that maybe the thing they’re abusing _shouldn’t_ have a leading underscore, and that you should promote it to a public (and documented) part of the API in your next minor version. Thus the responsibility for the abuse of an explicitly non-public function / method lies with the _user_, not with the _author_. The author’s responsibility ends at a well-crafted API... which does not require _privacy_, only some means to flag something as a public promise of stability vs something that shouldn’t be relied upon as such a promise.

Background of programmatic fundamentals will help tremendously. Java is arguably much more difficult than python. So if you did well with the java course, my best guess is that you will do very well with python.

Oh boy, I was ready for that half an hour sleep and wake up to all the upvotes. Now I have to deal with this. I should have known that this meme was cursed from the beginning when r/programmerhumor removed it.
oh, that was just a bad joke. As you can tell by the negative points. Like a python program, it's easier to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission. Will you accept my apology? - If yes: cool else: I'll delete the content
Dude, that is not a bad joke. That is a legitimate threat. This is not 4chan where anonymity is ensured. I maintain a good reputation across the communities I participate in. Use the meme. But be respectful to other people here. And in the next time please, ask for permission first. I just lost my sweet window for that siesta after one has a big lunch. Now, my whole day is ruined.

Well, it runs, but it does display this after. Hello The thread 0x1 has exited with code 0 (0x0). The program 'python.exe' has exited with code 0 (0x0).

While I'm not exactly sure what you're asking for, [docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org) has Language Reference documents for all Python versions.

What do you mean? I provided a screen shot from line 1, I'm showing you all the code I wrote.
I'm not get not an argument about it, as it's impossible that `print(Hello)` runs with Hello being undefined therefore the only possibility is that what you successfully ran wasn't exactly the same as what you pasted.
It's a damn screenshot of the exact same code I'm running... how more exact can you get?
Thanks I appreciate it. Can Arduino use C#?
On the off chane gthat you're being serious: programming languages are very specific, and spaces and punctuation matter. Therefore `print(Hello)` and `print("Hello")` are completely different.
I have been developing generic NLP, NLU engines useful for building chatbots aimed at Enterprises. Still some work is remaining here and there. Let's see where it goes.
I would be so stoked if I ran into someone at a party who had that shirt. At my work, I use python all day, every day by myself.
I'm aware of that, which is why after I noticed I didn't have the quotation marks, I added them in. Yet the program would print hello either way. As for proving I'm serious, besides it being rather pointless for me to put a bunch of fake code to annoy maybe 3 people, I'm not sure what more proof I can give than a screenshot of what I'm running.
I need to print out the correct pass
that's what she said
but both introverted and extroverted developers look at a pretty lady's boobs
That's not recursion. It's the same picture twice. Recursion would be a picture of the cover inside the picture of the cover over and over, which this is not.
they really love videogames. But the problem is that making any game despite how simple it is requires understanding of lists, loops, and functions. It is not that easy for them to REALLY understand it. (Do you know resources that explain such concepts in a fun way?). I thought about starting to build any game and then learn on the way despite how much of it they REALLY understand. At least they would end up doing something. I dunno how realistic that is.
Hey that guy wanted to discuss plants a few days ago!
a few things are wrong here.. - As mentioned, print(Hello) should be print("Hello") - You forgot your import statements (import sys, import os) at the top - start_game() does not exist - os.system('clear') I don't think it valid - A few typos in your help menu
Yeah, I got the 'clear' thing straight out of a tutorial, did cause an error. Should I just remove it? Not exactly sure what it does.
so you get no errors but no password and you're sure the password is in passwords.txt? You code got mangled so I can't tell about your indentation but the code itself seems like it should work.
Oh, 'clear' is for Linux, 'cls' would be for Windows. It just clears the console but I don't see the point of it really. Feel free to remove that line and no need to import os anymore
It semi works. If I have the concatenate section by itself it works. If I have the check pass it prints out the last in the text file. It seeds exeption handling and to print the pass that worked
Didn't work when I removed it, but then worked well when I added cls, so thanks! :)
I am sorry for the miscommunication. I did not understand the joke. I apologise too.
as long as the word 'my' isn't snuck in there, I'm good with this.
The migrations are builtin, but the tooling isn't yet there. We'll be adding that in alpha 3.
Well if he was referring to snakes then it should be “pythons” right? or at least precede the word “python” with an article.
well he said self taught ...

OP, not trying to be that guy, but you did agree to 'borrowing' the meme from another blog as well. I saw this a few times in r/gardening myself.
I'm in the same boat as you. Check out ros.org, though I'm finding the difficulty curve to starting rather high.

First, huge props to you both on building a better relationship in the last few years. Second, this is an advice I give to anyone who asks me about python. Find something that really, really annoys you at your job/University and try to fix it using Python. In my case, I got so annoyed with my downloads folder being generally disorganized. So I wrote a quick script that would classify every one of my download into directories like JPEG images or ebooks, etc. It's scheduled to run once per day to categorize. Also the book Automating the boring stuff with Python is a really good start. Good luck!
Please use a context manager. It automatically manages opening and closing of files. with open('myfile.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as fp: data = fp.read() # At this point the file is closed automatically for line in data: # whatever I know you want people all the stages, but at the end you really should mention the with context manager.

Help him do a project with stuff he cares about. Does he like a certain news outlet? Write a project to fetch rss feeds from their website and publish it into a PDF digest for him every morning. Does he have a hobby? Do a project to find and track prices at different vendors for hobby-related merchandise. Does he like engineering simulation? Set him up with some basic JavaScript/Python visualization tools to animate a simulation dataset. If you tie it to something he is interested in, he will naturally reach for ways to make it better and push the boundaries of the project instructions.

okay but can we acknowledge how the guy on the front-right is styling on all of us
I am not 100% certain but i don’t this us can use C#
/r/learnpython Don't share code with images. This is expected behaviour. \`set()\` takes an iterable, and makes a set whose items are the items of that iterable. That is, if you give it a tuple, the things *inside* the tuple will become the things *inside* the set. If you `set.add()` an item, that item is added to the set - it's not unpacked. `set()` takes one argument. Should it be impossible to create a set with more than one item? Of course not. `set.add()` takes one argument. Should it be impossible to add a single item to a set? Of course not. ```python s1 = set([1,2,3]) s1 == {1, 2, 3} s1.add(4) # should python try to unpack this? obviously not. s1 == {1, 2, 3, 4} ```
What's your experience with PyQt or Qt for Python? Right now PyQt has significantly more downloads, but the numbers might change over time.
Additional I would recommend to explain programming languages as it would be a language like every other. Explain the grammar (in python something like: a colon after declaring a function or the brackets to call a function, etc.), or the vocabular (the "def" to declare a function, the "return" keyword, and so on) This helps understanding programming languages because people know that every language has its rules. Hope this helps :) Good luck
Really nice idea! I've been struggling many times trying to find a specific concert using only the composer. I don't know whether I would be able to contribute, however, given my limited python knowledge 😀
Depending on the service most of them have an email address associated with the number. On verizon in the US, it's 1234567890 @ vtext.com and it will send to the mobile number. Maybe his service has something similar?
I am certainly interested in reviewing the project. If I can contribute, I will. github username same as reddit.
Not going to lie, I love Python but if I had a choice between it and C# to create a complex GUI-based program that someone was paying me for, I'd go with C# in a heartbeat.
Looks right to me! Set, like list, iterates the input
I only skimmed the post, but I am pretty convinced that the best way to handle ssh in python is via subprocess. Maybe you can’t (easily) do everything but I found it much easier than other options
If this is going to be web based, and you're going to retain the code, choose whatever you want. Both will be able to handle it fine. If this is stand alone GUI application that is only going to run on Windows machines, C#.
I’m just beginning Python but I am working on making a space invaders game off a tutorial on YouTube! First game I will have coded.
Juding by some of the other posts in this sub, a naked organist in the foyer.
 I put the wrong example in my notebook . What I wanted to ask is why `a = set(((1,2), ))` `a == {(1,2)}` `b = set()` `b.add((1,2),))` `b == {((1,2),)}` I guess that is because there are no tuples of 1 element `((1,2)) == (1,2) != ((1,2),)` It makes sense now for me even if I do not like the implicit unpacking very much. Lead to a bug in my code, where generated tuples can sometimes have length 1. Thanks for your reply!
Well in full disclosure: I work for Plotly, so yes I use it often, and it's part of my job to make the learning curve as easy as possible :)
Just to expand, the whole Scientific Python stack.
o nice~ btw have u seen magenta? https://magenta.tensorflow.org/ working in/around art seems to be one of the few ways you can effectively avoid moral compromises. unfortunately, art is "nonesstential" so unless you've got them "9oogel 10x dev" skills, you prolly wouldn't get assigned to the art project. w/e the case, magenta is fun.
codecombat would be a great option if they offered a lower/free option for NGOs. Maybe they do. Otherwise you only get the first 20 levels or so and those are very basic. I've tried Scratch, PyGame and so on and codecombat has been the only thing that is entertaining enough for bored 13 year olds.
In the post I also have some notes that it is easier to do in shell. Writing in Python is not for the purpose of "easy".
Kivy is probably the most popular option. It's a graphical framework supporting Android, and includes a quite capable drawing api for the types of thing you might do with pygame. I'm not aware of any active projects supporting pygame on Android in general, although it's quite possible they exist. There used to be pygame subset for Android, but I haven't heard of any developments there for a long time. What did you come across? That said, [pygame-sdl2](https://github.com/renpy/pygame_sdl2) should work on Android. I'm not sure if this is the main pygame api implementation using sdl2, or if the original pygame project is also moving in that direction.
Humble bundle frequently does programming book bundles. Codingbat is a good website to practice some very simple intro stuff.
You should look again.
&gt; I guess that is because there are no tuples of 1 element That's not true - you have one in your example! `((1,2),)` is a 1-length tuple, whose only item is a 2-length tuple. `((1,2))` is a 2-length tuple, whose two items are 1 and 2, because the outer brackets are not a tuple constructor like the inner brackets are: the outer brackets are more like the brackets you get in maths - e.g. `2 * (3 + 4)`. They just change operator precedence. &gt; `b.add((1,2),))` will fail because you have 2 left brackets and 3 right brackets. There is no implicit unpacking going on here. The set constructor takes a single iterable of items, which is the sane thing for it to do. The set add method takes a single item, which again, is the sane thing for it to do. Tuples you're generating should always be of the same length, because the difference between a list and a tuple is that the position of elements in a tuple is meaningful. But that's a nitpicky API design thing which tends to be ignored in python, where tuples are generally just treated as immutable lists.

You want the x86-64 executable installer, yes. Also, /r/learnpython.
Everything about this code is impressive! For extremely complex code it's broken into understandable bits and is well formatted, loads of comments, meaningful variable names.

With the accent on **you -** someone who have used C# and .NET. I'd rather kill myself if I have to create a complex GUI in .NET with C# instead in Qt or GTK with Python.
wxWidgets is really nice once you get something like [wxGlade](http://wxglade.sourceforge.net) to help build GUI's. I tried Qt, but their documentation site was painful to navigate and find the info I needed. wxWidgets' documentation on the other hand was a bit more readable and much easier to navigate. I haven't tried GTK with Python. wx seems to do it for me.
 as fun #if I say it enough times I might convince myself
What are the zipcodes actually? You said the dataframe considers them objects, but they must be something in python. I suspect that `to_csv` just calls `str` on anything it doesn't have a better idea what to do with, so whatever class the zipcode is is probably the culprit.
Don't use pyplot. What are you putting the table in? The normal thing to do would be to serialise it to LaTeX or HTML or something and then render that out, I would think.
&gt;second all languages are genarly propose That's not even close to true.
Don't be a sexist or over react to sexism and you probably won't get fired.
Don't get me wrong, I don't think there's anything more intuitive and easier to grasp on than C# and .NET using Visual Studio. I'm not familiar with those technologies, but used to use VB in VS and that was a piece of cake - I suppose that learning curve haven't change its slope much. But, I don't want to learn that if there's an option involving Python. I've heard of Python for Visual Studio, if op app has to be a native .NET, maybe I would go that way.
Is there any way to generate a nude Tayne?
Why a private GitHub repo. You should open it up!
I want this functionality in any programming language that I code in: https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a3027fb1a36738af582890c660c38c80d7d7135d/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f704733733368492e706e67 It makes my log statements into hyperlinks by inserting a psudo-stacktrace string into the logging statement at compile time without generating a stack trace at runtime. &gt; "A good Python IDE will enable you to click an error in the output and jump to source." I don't want to click on an error. I want to click on a line in the logs. For example, if a log line says "Saving to disk..." I want to click on that line in the logs and have it jump to the place where that is logged in the source code. I want it to jump to that line number and file name, and I don't want the overhead of generating a full blown stack trace at runtime. I add the stack trace not at runtime, but at compile time using Scala macros. &gt; "They also incorporate debuggers that will enable you to step through a program a line at a time and examine the values of variables." Again, I have to actually be in debug mode to do that. I just want to click on the log line, even if I'm not using debug mode. Sometimes debug mode slows down execution or increases latency so much that it messes up the execution of the program. This doesn't happen when I can just click on a line in the logs and jump to the place that line is printed in the source code. &gt; "I think it is a better alternative than to put print statements everwhere and then remembering to have to remove them." I don't need to add anything other than what I regularly log. The compiler adds + "file name" + ":" + "line number" or something like that at compile time, not at runtime. I have been using debuggers and stuff for years, and I still run into situations where I have to go through the logs and I have to grep to find where that line in the logs is printed in the code. With this it tells me the file name and line number and if I'm in an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ I can just click on that line in the logs and it jumps straight to the code. No need to bring out the debugger and re-execute the program. I implemented this functionality using compile time macros. It's a wrapper around the regular logger. It just adds some extra info to the String printed by the log statements in the source code.
I considered that. The purpose of the project is to canonize and unify information that is currently disparate, scattered, and buried behind layers of advertising and UI on often poorly designed websites. The code basically cleans and makes an API out of the data. I can’t see a reason to have more than one instance of it, except for development purposes. I can see opening the API itself, but opening the code to make the API would invite people to make variations on the data — which is an aspect of the problem the project is trying to solve. I’d welcome discussion however.

Alright, let me be a little tougher. I will not look at the Python program logs if the logs do not have the file name and line number at the end of each log statements, and I want the file name and line number to be formatted to look like a stacktrace so that I can just click on it without having to do "grep".
It was sent via a text file. I tried exporting them without even touching the file. import &gt; export, and they were floats. Does this mean it's a problem with the underlying file that was sent to me? How come python can't deal with a simple conversion?
I could help, i recently made a simple multithreaded downloader for some webscraping program. Setup is pretty easy! Pm me if you need help.
Which version of Pandas are you using? Prior to 0.24 (I think) null values in a column full of integers would give this type of behavior. Could be wrong though.
The standard library logging module can emit the file and line number when it logs. https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logrecord-objects To be able to click a line in the log and open the source code file requires an IDE plugin. I don't know of one, but that doesn't mean there isn't one (or that you can't write one).
&gt; "To be able to click a line in the log and open the source code file requires an IDE plugin." No it does not. In Scala, this functionality is not created via an IDE plugin. Any IDE or text editor that supports click-jump-to-code for regular Java stacktraces also works for this because the file name, class name, function (or method) name, and line number all all obtained by the compiler at compile time and are concatenated to the end of the String that is printed by the logger. From the point of view of the IDE, it's indistinguishable from a real one line stack trace, but all this meta-data (file name, class name, method name, line number) is pulled at compile time by the Scala compiler.
&gt;Any IDE or text editor that supports click-jump-to-code for regular Java stacktraces That sounds like an IDE plugin. A pure notepad editor doesn't have that.
Technically it could, you'd just need to find a Python to Machine Language interpreter. A good analogy would be can you use English to request something from someone who doesn't speak English. You can speak English to them, but make sure an interpreter is present.
How did you get it into a dataframe from the text file? You might be able to explicitly set the type at import depending on how you're doing it.

&gt; "That sounds like an IDE plugin feature. A pure notepad editor doesn't have that." Windows Notepad doesn't have jump-to-stacktrace built in, but every single IDE that I have ever used (Eclipse, Netbeans, IntelliJ, Visual Studios) has this functionality built in without the need to install anything extra. Heck, I think "simple" text editors like Vim even have this functionality. I'm more of an IDE person than a vim/emacs person, though. &gt; "(If it comes with it, it will be implemented as a plugin and shipped as part of the default environemnt)" Oh. My bad. I have a really weird brain. I can't remember any keyboard shortcuts (I have used computers since I was like 7 years old and all I know are Ctrl+C, Ctr-V, Ctrl-Z, and Ctr-A). I tried vim and I tried to learn keyboard shortcuts, but I can't. My brain won't retain that information. I need visual pictures - I don't have muscle memory. That's why I ONLY program in IDE's. I would be interested in trying Python. For example, on the Java Virtual Machine, I need a module system like OSGI to load component changes runtime, but since Python is a scripting language, there is no need for OSGI. That being said, there are a lot of things about Scala (and to a lesser extent languages like Java and Kotlin) that I miss. I miss things like powerful macros that can do crazy things. Like in Scala I can write a function that takes in another function as a parameter, re-orders the lines or expressions that make up that function, and then print out the inner function with the lines reversed. Or I can program entirely with zero mutable state and no mutable pointers. I can do pure functional programming. I can right click or do a keyboard shortcut (I forgot what the keyboard shortcut is), but there is a trick that will insert the type of the variable for me so that I get all the benefits of strong, static typing without having to physically type out any of the types. There is also a thing in the IDE that shows all the types (like in sort of transparent) so that I can know all the types without having to physically type out any types. I miss things like strong auto-complete, go-to-declaration, pure functional programming, etc. Scala is such a big strong programming language with lots of functionality. It almost feels like a step backward to go from Scala to Python just so that I don't have to use OSGI to dynamically load changed libraries or components.
One thing you didn't touch on, PySide2 actually has API documentation in Python: https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qtforpython/index.html PyQt5 doesn't, https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/ instead it relies on the Qt C++ API docs, so often you have to infer how the SIP binding did things:
I don’t quite understand the issue could you help me? If you open sourced the code you are worried that other people would use the source code to get info from your data sources and not use your website? Wouldn’t people just web scrape your website?
Basically, I am a feature addict. The moment I get a powerful new feature, I start to rely on it to boost my productivity and then I forget how to live without it. I end up constantly wanting the newest, shiniest, most powerful thing. I would program in Haskell if Haskell had the ecosystem, library, and tooling that Scala and the JVM had, but unfortunately Haskell's ecosystem, library, and tooling is way behind. I might also do Kotlin or F#, but ever since I started programming in Scala, I just felt like Java wasn't as good and I didn't want to move back to Java. I tried moving back and I did write some Java code, but I didn't like writing code as much. &amp;#x200B; I don't want that same experience programming in Python. I want to feel that I am moving forward or upwards technologically, not backwards or downwards. I was exposed to Python as a beginner, but Python kind of has this reputation as a relatively "beginner" programming language while C++ and Scala are more "advanced" programming languages. I like writing LARGE amounts of highly maintainable code in short periods of time and I don't want to feel like I am giving that up programming in Python.
C# is probably better here, particularly with regards to licensing (Visual Studio at $50/month is not particularly expensive). The Aero GUI toolset for C# (or whatever it's called now) is a bit more bare-bones than Qt but there's plenty of packages out there on Nuget for the various widgets you want to implement.
I was thinking that maybe if I programmed in Python I could use the explicit typing feature in the newest version of Python, use IntelliJ's Pycharm IDE, and maybe implement my own "click on log line to jump to location in source code" functionality to kind of make up for what I don't have in Scala. Maybe throw in a functional programming library. Or maybe it's best for me to just stick to Kotlin, Scala, and F#.

In retrospect, I think that some people prefer strong, statically typed programming language and coding in a feature-rich visual IDE and other people prefer weak or dynamically typed programming languages and coding in a simple text editor. I am the former. I enjoyed coding in C, C++, Java, Scala, and a little bit of Haskell, but I absolutely hated coding in Ruby. No auto-complete, go-to-declaration, and I didn't even get useful IDE functionality on the Ruby codebase that I was forced to work on. Simply put, I would not code in Perl, PHP, or Ruby and I will not code in Python without at the very least a working IDE with auto-complete, go-to-declaration, and other features that I get out of coding in say Java with a Java IDE.
In retrospect, maybe it's not a good idea for a person who is physically unable to code without auto-completion to code in a dynamically typed programming language. Python is usually not strongly typed, so I simply should avoid programming in Python unless I absolutely have to.
It's actually "piqued". This post brought to you by grammar Nazi.
That makes no sense. /r/learnpython read the sidebar use the search tool
&gt;The question is, how large? All of them. :) Use a generator, I've done it like this: def document(self): for x in y: ... yield idx, body def bulk(self): generator = ({ "_index": self.es.index, "_id": idx, "_source": body, } for idx, body in self.document()) return helpers.bulk(self.es, generator)
All programs are comprised of "smaller programs within". Be more precise.
&gt;https://pypi.org/project/stronk/ How about performance ?
That variable is only used at startup time to register the blueprint. Thread safety matters in request handling, and the variable created there isn’t used in request handlers.
So to clarify, you have received a CSV, and then imported it into a pandas dataframe, and then exported it again? CSVs have no type information so pandas has to infer it. If it sees a column which could feasibly be numbers, it'll import them as numbers: this is sensible behaviour, because the reverse is usually just an added annoyance. If it imports numbers, it'll err on the side of floats: this is sensible behaviour, because they're more flexible. If you print a float which happens to be (very close to) an integer value, python may not show you the `.00000000000000001` or whatever: this is sensible behaviour because it's unlikely that level of precision is important to you given that all floating point math is approximate. So printing the dataframe may make you think it's stored as something other than a float. But then if you explicitly cast it to a string, it will make sure that the string is unambiguously a float: by tacking on the `.0`. This is sensible behaviour because it means that the next person along knows the data type. You probably want to be dealing with your zip codes as strings. To get pandas to read what is very clearly a number and treat it as a string, you need to tell it to do so, with the `dtype` argument in `read_csv`.

The project addresses the issue that information on concerts is difficult to find. The reason is that it’s spread out over thousands of independent sources, each with their own websites and formats. To propagate it onto more websites by making an open source tool for this seems to compound the problem. See similar projects like MusicBrainz, for instance. 20 different people will contribute their versions of metadata for a single album, and in the end it’s as messy as if the data weren’t collected to begin with.

I assume the idea of the game is to click on "objects" that are different. If so, then define rectangles around every object that can be clicked. Draw the images and allow user to click on one the images. Find "correct finds" by detecting if user clicked inside any of the object rectangles.

Yep.
Could you explain a little? I'm fairly inexperienced with vectorized operations.
Understood, I won’t mess about with the 32. Thanks for speaking up.
Tell me a programming language that is not compiled in C and passed to assembler, or that interacts directly with the OS that is compiled in C, most known languages or object-oriented languages can do the same as others, in different ways, is truth I do not mean to make drivers directly in C, but my point is that you have to see the advantages of one over another based more on their frameworks and performance as described above. Please do not say that HTML is a programming language, regards
so a few things: 1. check the formatting guide, (4 spaces preceding code snips are your friend). We are only guessing at which blocks are indented to which level. . . 2. Why using the while True: block if you have a value to check against. If you are using try. . . how about this? #!/usr/bin/python3 LOOP = True MAX_VAL = 10 result = 0 def scratch_func(y): try: x = int(input('Input a number 1-{:d}, ctl-c to exit: '.format(y))) except ValueError: state, x = scratch_func(y) except KeyboardInterrupt: x = '\nYou ask me to end the process. Goodbye!' state = False else: if x &gt; y: print('Input out of range') state, x = scratch_func(y) else: x += y state = True return state, x while LOOP: LOOP, result = scratch_func(MAX_VAL) print(result)
Me too. I've never used numpy. Maybe this will help? I'm on mobile so I can't test anything right now. Pretty sure I've got the ranges off. from itertools import product x_len, y_len = arr.shape stride = 2 arr[np.array(*product(range(0, x_len, stride), range(0, y_len, stride))) = 1
That's exactly the type of solution I was looking for, thanks! I always forget about itertools.

Could we get a syntax error output, perhaps?
So the other answers here are what you should probably use. However, if you want something that runs really fast and also might cut your fingers off/segfault, there is always stride\_tricks: `import numpy as np` `from numpy.lib.stride_tricks import as_strided` `d = 3` `node_blocks = 5` &amp;#x200B; `N = node_blocks * d + 1` `output = np.ones((N, N))` &amp;#x200B; `block_view = as_strided(output, (node_blocks, node_blocks, d, d),` `(d * output.strides[0], d * output.strides[1],` `output.strides[0], output.strides[1]))` &amp;#x200B; `block_view[:, :, 1:, 1:] = 0.0` The output is in the array output.
Passed it

Dell 5520 i7 32GB 2TB NVMe. I use Ubuntu because it’s Debian based and I’ve been using it for 10 years or so. Before that was red hat / fedora. KDE and custom kernel 5.0.7 (mostly because I can). Disclaimer: I hate all the custom cloud crap and remove all the Ubuntu special apps. No App Store, cloud crap, etc.
Nice! Makes sense that bulk would accept a generator as iterable.
I always use CentOS / RHEL, but for the most part, I am developing in a virtual env, so the OS doesn’t matter much.
Xubuntu. Xfce is nice and lightweight, and ubuntu itself has huge community, so it's easy to find answers, when you have questions. Debian looks ok, but it dissapointed me once, when it could not find drivers for wifi (ubuntu could)
Arch, because the AUR is awesome, and the repos are bleeding edge.
Whatever the customer wants, because that is what the customer want. . . over the years have used: - Slackware - RedHat/CentOS - Debian - Ubuntu - Mint - Corel - Turbo - SuSE - Arch - Gentoo - LFS - Raspbian - Kali/Knoppix/Distro on a drive Give me something with VIM and Bash and we are cool. If you want me to admin the box, I will make recommendations after asking what your goals are.
Linux Mint. It's Ubuntu without all the bullshit.
Kubuntu, gets the work done and I like KDE. Previously I used Xubuntu until I found Plasma consumes the same in my desktop.
...macOS :) I work with hosting, so we have all kinds of distros to support, and me using any one of them wouldn’t make much difference. Nor have I had any problems using a Mac while developing tools for our Linux admin environment. To me, personally, I like the no-hassle desktop with pretty much all the strengths of a Linux system (or, at its worst, compatibility with it).
As of right now, no. Might release it in the future once I have less bugs and a cleaner code.
SublimeText
I agree. Arch is so nice
Arch, but really any distro that has vim and that I can boot as a terminal (which arch does the best job of)
The trouble is exposing blueprint instance which can be changed in any request isnt wise choice. Why they dont declare it in some singleton or immutable object to prevent race condition?
Agreed
Same.
nano
linuxmint because im lazy
Atom is gross. It uses electron. Electron is bad period. If you want an editor similar to atom that isn't garbage use sublime text. If you want to know what editor I personally recommend, that would be vim. But vim isn't similar to atom, so I would say sublime text is probably what you're looking for.
If you can determine the size of the final array in advance, create it using `np.ones` and turn every `d`th row into the the zero-padded "vector" - `ones[d::d] = zero_padded_vec`.
Solus OS (https://getsol.us/) — it hits the sweet spot for me by being a rolling release distro (like Arch), which means you continuously get new versions of software, but also focusing on compatibility, which results in a more comfortable end user experience (like e.g. Ubuntu). Mind you, I like Arch a lot and used it for quite some time, in the end I just prefer someone to do the thinking for me as regards whether an upstream update will break my existing system or not :) Philosophically, you can think of Solus as a sort of more curated Arch, though technically they are of course completely independent.
Hey! You are "stealing" built-in functionally of [NGS](https://ngs-lang.org/) ! :) On additional note, NGS doesn't require the if that checks whether the script is running as main. If you define a main function, it will automatically run by the language but only in case that the script is running as main (not included from another script). If I remember correctly, Perl 6 also has this functionality of the box.
Same
Do you use pycharm, vs code or something else?
So basically an opinion on any technology a developer will/would use?
Manjaro so I can make use of the AUR without jumping through the hoops required for an Arch install
Atom
Ubuntu at home and Redhat for work... &amp;#x200B; Ubuntu just works with minimal BS... CentOS is pretty good too though IMO
Archlabs, because it all ready comes with i3 set up so I can still get all the benefits of arch and AUR without spending a lot of time ricing from scratch.
Ubuntu - full installation, dot files from git and pkgsync lists. Also VSCode for IDE
Ubuntu 16.04, mainly because I'm most familiar with Debian/Ubuntu distros at this point. Running i3wm as my desktop manager to save on precious RAM usage, Unity was too sluggish for my tastes.
Isn't Debian Ubuntu without the bullshit?
manjaro. Because im a nerd.
I normally use CentOS / RHEL on servers and Fedora KDE spin on my laptop / development environment. CentOS is one of the best options and is very common in production environments. You probably know already that with virtualenv, etc., one can run any version of Python that they need on that or any OS.
Visual Studio Code
What do you mean by lightweight? Less RAM usage, less CPU, minimal UI, other? VSCode is a lot different to Atom, what is it in VSCode that is too “heavy”?
do you realize you're in /r/python?
I always feel like such a basic bitch when answering this question. I'm nearly 20 years into Unix/Linux and I always end up on Ubuntu for local dev/home servers. Production cloud can be either Ubuntu or Alpine (Centos when requested).
If you want various plugins and language support, then it can't be lightweight. You can go with pycharm as it has all core functionalities for python programming. And if you are a command line guy, then grab atom or sublime(has built in console) and you are good to go. I personally use atom, as IDE's can restrict you in different wayz.
De Ian, because it's the best and I get the exact same system as the production. Sometime for work purpose I use RHEL and CentOS, I hate it.
vim is fantastic and there is a Python plug-in for it. One can't get anything lighter than that, really. That said, I actually quite like VS Code *(and I've hated Microsoft for a long time).* I like Atom a lot too. I use both of those regularly, but probably favour VS Code the most. You could have an open terminal tab next to the one running vim for quick task switching, and/or you could split the terminal window any which way with tmux and have both a code editing pane and a terminal pane in front of your eyes at all times. All together, I think that simple set-up would give you everything you've asked for.
Vim
What bullshits ?
I am using Ubuntu on my personal laptop. It was the first one I found when looking for recommendations and I was and still am happy with with.
vs code or sublime both r good
never knew about Solus. And now I‘m in love with it! Thank you 🙏🏻
I think he means security updates: https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/4v116g/can_we_stop_recommending_linux_mint/
interesting distro, am going to give this one a try.
Fedora, its great give it a try.
I use Ubuntu, primarily because I'm used to it and I've never tried anything else. When I was in elementary school, it was the easiest thing for me to try out and they were even sending free CDs. Never felt the need to change since then. I've been willing to try out Arch for some time now though.
Totally agree, I used ubuntu about two years ago. It's not that user friendly. Linux Mint is the way to go, my fave OS, for already a year now. Regardless of the Linux distro, I use pycharm for python. It's just better than any other ide.
I use PyCharm!! It just makes everything easier. What about you?
Can't exactly see how Python development correlates to a specific Linux distro, but I use Fedora At the time when the main two branches split onto Red Hat (RPM-based) and Debian (Deb-based), I stuck with Red Hat. Fedora followed as a free alternative and standalone development unit. It is a cutting-edge distro, yet stable enough for me not to spend too much time on and be able to focus on other matters. I emphasize this as I might otherwise consider Arch, I just can't be bothered to troubleshoot too much, nor do I have the luxury of time to do so in my everyday life.
Emacs is rock solid.
How does PyCharm meet your demand? Performed any tests yet?
I especially like the segmentation here. Saving this for further review and referencing later
Vim
I just installed pycharm, figured if try it out. I use visual studio as my main development ide, mainly because I have the hotkeys memorized and I have JS setup too. I've been wanting to see if pycharm is quicker/less frustrating to run. Since you added not one but two "!" - I think I'll have to give pycharm a good run.
Debian with Cinnamon may be a better (and safer) option to look at.
Python is increasing in popularity, so the variety of jobs that demand it is increasing A general rule of thumb is that if certain code requires readability and isn't too worried about performance, Python will be the first choice. Mind you, this doesn't always apply This means that matters such as scripting (automatization) alongside the ones you named all come to the spotlight

I've been using Debian stable for years. A lot of people complain about how old some of the packages are, but for me it is just solid and tried and tested. I do mostly Python development and virtualenv ensures that I can have recent dev packages without breaking system packages. Win-win.
Also because its very stable.
Alpine, because I like to keep my env and config in a reproducible docker image
Same here, i think eOS is really good except the default file manager. Hope they will improve it in the 20.04 release.
xubuntu because it's trivial to set up. At the time I made the choice, I moved away from unity on ubuntu because it was sluggish on my laptop (1gb ram). The rest basically doesn't matter to me, I have my files backed up, so if I break something I can just redo everything, and be ready to go again in 2-3 hours. I edit code with geany, use git with command line. Mostly because those are the lightweight options. Every time I've tried some other, more fancy IDE, it ate half my ram or crashed all the time. I use it on a 10" netbook from 2011, I think. It's a neat coding machine, it can browse the web and write .py's.
&gt;photoshop does comtypes work with Mac? and can I use it to script Adobe Illustrator instead?
And arch switch to default python 3 ages before others ! That was awesome in that time. For those who want the quality of Arch repos and AUR without the pain of installing each single components of your environment (that is funny but sometimes you just don't have time) Manjaro is really awesome too !
Gentoo isn't for everyone, but I've used it for years and don't really feel any need to migrate elsewhere. From python dev perspective almost any distro will work out just fine anyway.
I wholeheartedly second manjaro. I'm using arch at home for years, recently I installed manjaro on my work computer, and it's great. It's very close to arch, so you have the same control over your machine, but with sensible defaults for everything, installs super easily and quickly.
Ew, centOS. Here’s a small tip: learn to use docker. You can install a modern Linux distribution (Ubuntu, fedora, whatever) to get all the modern bells and whistles and up to date software. Then you install docker and configure a centos image pinned to the same version as what your org uses. And viola, you now have a modern up to date Linux machine with a centos docker container to do your dev work.
I definitely agree! I also think the default terminal isn't that pretty, so i installed the gnome one. Other than that, an amazing distro without any real flaws
I think it should work with Illustrator but comtypes seems to be windows only.
Can vouch for Solus. I've been using it for a few weeks now, and I'm loving it. Budgie (the desktop environment) looks amazing, and is pretty customizable. eopkg (the package manager) is nice to use, and has a good gui. Stuff is really easy to install, even without any knowledge
Most likely because that would require more code and they want to keep the examples short.
Vim is what you are looking for if you want something lighter than atom
I use Ubuntu, but the distro doesn't matter if you use pyenv.
I have similar approach my friend!
Arch because I'm familiar with it and because all our stuff runs in Docker anyway, so I don't have to worry about having a compatible environment.
Work laptop: Ubuntu 18.04, with Unity as desktop manager. Because it just works. Personal desktop PC: Gentoo, no need to reinstall or run major updates (that always go bad).
MacOS ain't Linux its Unix, so you didn't really answer the question.
If we talking about techno corporate bullshit it's all about bleeding edge right now. Cutting edge is not cutting enough apparently xD /s
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s. *I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*
Well, I was destroyed, that's sad. Oki, corrected!
I use a Mac with pyenv to control python and pipenv is our chosen way to deploy our tooling (mainly infra automation)
I'm doing Python and NodeJs development in parallel all the time and I use PyCharm for that. PyCharm Professional provides pretty good support for NodeJs via a plugin and for me it's very handy to have one IDE for all my projects. PyCharm's debugging abilities are very good. For Python it can display the contents of Pandas Dataframes etc.
I don't get it. What is lazy about mint ?. Explain
Netrunner rolling. (based on Arch) It provides recent kernel and drivers that work really well on my ryzen + rx580 system, is fast, has recent versions of software (official or via AUR), and provides a nice KDE desktop that I like.
I'm new to Unix systems so Linux Mint Cinnamon is pretty good for me but still it's 200 times better than Windows
Ever set up arch? Needs more effort, but I like it way better personally because I have more control opposed to the preconfigured mint setup. Mint is still nice though but just doesn't fit my needs
I'm using mint and loving cinnamon, but try i3wm is in my bucket list.
I’m quite aware, thank you.
Arch is easy these days with distros such as Antergos doing all the configuration for you.
That's depends on your definition of Bullshit. If you call bullshit all the non open source software then Debian is your bread and butter. If you want to use privative codecs and drivers (without adding all the ppa manually) then mint is for you.
Well, to be fair, I'm at a point where I can do my arch setup without wiki (except for the systemd-boot config)
PyQt has been around much longer, that's why it is more known.
Wow, I didn't know Pycharm handled Node.js. I'll check it out. Thank you!
No. Only used redhat, mint , Ubuntu and elementary. I liked mint for daily use. And ubantu and redhat as a server.
What specific benefits do you get out of having more control though. I really value my time, and sometimes I already find myself wasting hours to configure or make something work on Mint.
PyCharm isn't very lightweight. Pretty much production level focused. Sublime would be a better option.
Yea but my point is that Arch has some super user friendly options. Additionally I feel that driver support is better out of the box than debian. The AUR + a package manager can also be used as a Gui to manage your Python packages which is kinda unique.
Look at the free courses at [DataCamp.com](https://DataCamp.com), theirs official courses as well as community created tutorials.
How is PyCharm for data science stuff? Vscode has a sort of jupyter-like interactive thing that I can't live without, but seeing the contents of a dataframe sounds awesome.
I'd recommend Antergos for this. I'm pretty sure you end up with an entirely standard arch install, it just has a bit more user friendly installer for first timers.
I'm just getting on the Manjaro/Arch bandwagon after 10+ years of living in the Debian/Ubuntu/Mint ecosystem. I've been missing out. So far Manjaro+i3 has given me far fewer weird issues than any other distro I've used. The Arch wiki is just so fantastic and detailed.
I used mint for a while but got fed up of not being able to change things in cinnamon. It might have changed since then (~2014-15) but I'm unlikely to switch back.
True that. But why would you go globally with python packages?
Cheers dude! another question, is it better to learn R first and then move onto Python topics or doesn't really matter?
Develop on arch, deploy on debian
Debian Because I use ist since day one of my linux switch. It offers me all I need vor developing.
Yeah i’ve always been curious. I never needed to use something arcane in my daily dev life that i hoped i had better control on some internals of my OS. Lots of people recommend arch and i’m wanting to try it out, just can’t see why I would want to spend that time. I feel like i share a similar sentiment as you.
Snap. I installed 16.04 when it came out as couldn't face reinstalling everything when 18.04 came out. When 16.04 reaches EOL it'll probably be replaced with arch. I've been using it on my netbook for a year or so and is been good so far. i3 is on both of them. It's now awkward to go back to gnome on my work desktop.
The configuring around is exactly my problem. Mint is preconfigured for an out-of-the-box experience; works for most people but I want config files untouched unless I need to mess with them. In my experience this also makes arch upgrades smoother, even if the last one was half a year ago, while major upgrades in mint/Ubuntu always were a catastrophe for me. But this is only my own experience.
There's a lot to be said for using an os as standard. Reinstalling takes no time to set up and you don't learn to rely on non standard stuff when you use a different machine. Ubuntu is so well supported that there's not much that ever goes wrong without an answer being on the first couple of Google results.
Can confirm also use mint. Source: am lazy Initially wanted to sample it then stuck because it felt light and simple.
Antergos, because it's like Arch but I actually managed to install it.
On which DE? Xfce? Deepin? I've personally been using Deepin but I've found it's bit more response intensive.
Mint had a few serious security issues a few years ago. I know their website was breached but I don't know if their apt key was, what I care about. I do know that there were a few security failures. "A few" quickly becomes unforgivable. Currently I'm on Ubuntu with cinnamon (even if gnome login screen keeps bugging through).
A deep seated hatred for your future self.
everything works out of the box most of the time, so you don't have to know that much about linux to use it. and it comes with more stuff than most people need/want so it can be considered bloated
It will be. :) In my case the first generator (variable y in above code) is the bottleneck, something like that is not expected in your case as you use fast pandas csv read.
Arch because aur
And now you've committed ~20% of your dev time to docker development.
CentOS because work Fedora on the workstation
Please, stop spamming. Thank you.
It takes a bit to get used to and set up to look nice but you won't want to switch back.
It doesn’t help to learn R first as much these days. I did, but I think Python has come so far that it’s better to skip R. R is still a good option, but need not be your first.
My own experience showed that antergos is more resource intensive, also last time I gave it a chance it froze at install on a ultrabook from Asus where manjaro was just fine. Also the time I tried it on decent hardware was several years who and it may have improved since then and the Asus ultrabook was crappy hardware. I may give it another try sometimes. But in the end I also like manjaro for trying to bring Linux to a larger professional public. Then even created a manjaro laptop. I think that these kind of initiative can do a lot of good to the whole Linux ecosystem.
it depends on what you're looking for! what kind of scientific programming in particular? numerical methods / symbolic computation / machine learning / data visualization etc etc. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; If you can narrow your scope a little for me I'd be happy to help! :D
Why is electron bad?
the python community is thriving for scientific computing! go all in on python, friend
The PySide2 documentation is there-**ish**. If anyone could point me at how to do QML and python Qt object decorators in python i will be amazed.
Microsoft word
Python is SUPER versatile. It's used heavily in machine learning, AI, data science/analysis, etc, there's a lot of support and versatility in it. I'd only learn R if you have a very specific reason to need to learn it, if you find Python can't do something you want. Another interactive website is [DataQuest.io](https://DataQuest.io), similar to DataCamp.com
This is a two year old post. A lot of these issues are no longer her relevant today. Upgrades for example now include kernel updates and a snapshot functionality allows you to revert to a previous configuration should the need arise.
Because it’s a resource hog. They had a story about atom bringing a modern PC to its knees. It ended up being the caret blinking. We all though eclipse was bad, then we built a tool to let loose the web devs.
Arch Linux😍😍 1) I love rolling releases. I'm the kind of person who likes to have all the new features immediately be it with some bugs. 2)Uses python3 by default (the best reason to use arch Linux for python devs) 3) KISS principle 4) AUR (Anything and everything with some caveats of course like security) 5) Awesome performance (An advantage of kiss)
Probably not the right sub for this, but that does suck.
Ubuntu net installer. Get to use the PPA repos and all the tools that I need are usually available without having to perform triple back flips to get the essentials to work (SSH, terminal etc)
you could learn on the way, or with super simple games. a simple Snake game in python would probably have most of the concepts even. [here's a youtube video that i think you could base it off of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbasThWVb-c) other simple-ish games would be maybe hangman or connect4
That falls into what in other languages you'd call *macros*. Python does not support this, There are ways to accomplish the same thing, but not the way you're imagining.

Are dictionaries difficult to create / manage? It may work out for what I'm doing
Still happy with Ubuntu since 2005. Though now I definitely change the experience a lot with i3 and my very custom config, but it's still a good basis to start from and tweak.
A customer asked for LFS? Lol, must have been an interesting project, if you are into these sorts of things.
Not really? If you can use a virtualenv / condaenv then you can use docker.
Antergos (when I used it) wouldn't install 3/4 for times and the community (in the forums) was very toxic and disrespectful.
There are third party extensions which implements [Syntactic macros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science)#Syntactic_macros) for python using transformation of the abstract syntax tree (AST), for example MacroPy. &amp;#x200B; [https://github.com/lihaoyi/macropy](https://github.com/lihaoyi/macropy)
They're a fundamental data structure in python. I suggest starting a tutorial, or reading a book on Python.
I am, thanks!
I suppose he could use `locals()[f‘Cat{I}’]`, but I really couldn’t recommend that at all. A proper dictionary or list would be much better.
Debian. It's what my employer provides.
No, they are a fundamental component of the language. r/learnpython
yes I checked that. Sure I could only see the first 20 levels, and I cannot know if it fits the class before try it all. I guess I just gotta buy one account for now. (do you know if there is a review kinda thing of it on youtube?)
