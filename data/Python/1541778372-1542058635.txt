Glad to hear the Quart author himself is "available" here in Reddit. Of course I'll PM you if I have any question I can't get an answer myself.
Aside very important issues in Sanic architecture: https://github.com/huge-success/sanic/issues/1176 - Sanic does not support HTTP/2 - Sanic is similar to Flask, but does not support Flask's stack, which is a requirement for me in order to reuse my own code. - Sanic performance is not that good. 
AFAIR NLTK can be used for word analisis. Counting words is just a simple way to demonstrate its usage. I've used it very long time ago and don't remember the details, sorry. Let the OP try it and decide. 
Much better. Next step is picking the right colors. You don‚Äôt have to spell out YouTube subscription, use a graphic that says so. The table is still not mobile friendly. Get rid of tables, this is 2018!
When developing in Python, the answer is almost always Pycharm. It has a load of deployment options, click to deploy to ssh server, definitely check it out. I also sometimes deploy by doing git push and then running git pull on the server with a loading script.
You most likely want gunicorn or another like it. I use nginx personally, I install gunicorn in the environment, and run it from a systemd unit without activating the virtualenv, though it still uses it. Gunicorn opens a socket and I just have nginx configured to use that socket. I'm sure apache would work similarly
Absent a very large dataset of labeled data for your definition of "meaningful", this doesn't seem like a task well-fitted to machine learning. Searching for words in a string (from a dict of potential words) is a straightforward task that requires no learning. Allowing letters to be used multiple times with overlap (e.g., `'SouPeaSugaRice'` -&gt; `['Soup', 'Pea', 'Sugar', 'Rice']`) doesn't add particular complexity though could give more nonsensical results. After identifying potential mappings, you'll have to find ways to score the mappings to see if any qualify as "meaningful". Maybe you have data based on word usage or data based on parts of speech tagging and identified valid sentence structures based on PoS. E.g., `Iwenttoatherapist` giving two options `['I', 'went', 'to', 'a', 'therapist']` or `['I', 'went', 'to', 'a', 'the', 'rapist']`, having the second one get eliminated because the noun `rapist` has two articles in front of it.
If this is really important to you, can I give you a spelling correcter that took care of this (it corrected spelling mistakes, joined split words, and split up joined words). It used a language model to decide how a word should be split up (sometimes there are multiple ways to split a word..). It won't take care of the case of gibberish words though. The way you do it is you have a list of valid words, then you go through your text is enumerate all possible ways the words in your sentence could be split up, then you choose that which your language model gives the best score to.

Misleading to whom? Using anything when you don't know the ramifications is bad practice. Assert is fine and I will use the hell out of it because it's good practice to use it as it's designed. Thinking you've found a shortcut that everyone else has missed somehow, and then liberally peppering your code with it is obviously dangerous and should have at least triggered a check of the documentation. 
The way you do it is you have a language model and a word list, then you go through the words of your text and split them up (by going through your word list and checking which fit into your word), then enumerate all possible paths and score each one with your language model. Pick the best scoring one.
Thank you very much. I didn't thought to break it like that. And sorry for posting in wrong sector!
I'm being pedantic.. but You want to enumerate all paths instead of only picking the best word at each step. For example "threemonthstillkickoff" -&gt; "three month still kickoff" instead of "three months till kickoff". And I don't think it makes sense to use viterbi since you're not taking context into account anyways (and if you did, you'd want to take forward context into account).
Excellent summary. I largely agree. I disagree with your last point, though. For the same reason you are right on the other points, I want to see the assumptions of the test writer. Having named values prevents me from having to dig through the code to figure out why they used *those specific values*. This is especially true as code starts to age and everyone isn't familiar with the obscure business rules that were fresh in the mind of the test writer.
I definitely agree, however this is a university project I am doing and the point is to try and find a solution with the kit I currently have. It‚Äôs the MetaMotionR kit from MbientLab I actually saw some matlab projects referencing an AHRS routine, so maybe there‚Äôs something there I need to investigate, thank you!

Agreed. Most of my constant variables in my test code are named `SOME_X` so that it is clearer that this is effectively a random value with no significance.
One challenge here is that often times developers are adding tests to an existing file or code base. In such cases, it often makes sense to follow existing convention. In other cases, APIs might be beyond a developers full control. For example, an API might require injection or setup of a complex object. There is no way around setting up these objects in tests and developers are loathe to repeat these complex and perhaps fragile object setups in each test instance. One thing that is missed by the article is that when these external APIs change, developers often need to manually update each test instance when there is a high level of code repetition. In most cases, input arguments change slightly from test to test as a result of different parameters being tested but they are still structurally the same object. I fear that the article doesn't give due credit to the reasons why developers might favor parameterizing test and input setup in helper methods. As always, there are complex trade-offs in software engineering and it is better to give readers a sense of why each trade-off might be useful rather than suggesting that certain practices are done because professionals don't know better.
Don't use global variables syntax for a local variable.

That is how we track a company's team score. You can sign up with any email address, but will not be able to see your company's average team score.
Of course its possible. You just do that like any other web project in python, and host on local network. You could easily achieve this by using some popular web frameworks like Django or Pyramid. You could also look at some CMS and customize it to fit your needs, which could be faster at the beginning but once project grows it might be a pain to add more custom functionality.
Considering that turbogears is an alternative to django (and definitely not any kind of dependency of django-registration), I think you are probably not running the right command.

Yes, the Neuron project was a summer college project and won't be further developed; work on Jupyter support is happening in the main Python extension now.
Based on [this](https://github.com/santinic/pampy/commit/c4013cab6283826d26fba2730b724bf9bcd01c0d), I guess you don't want the 'drafts/' folder published, and you may have thought the rename into the drafts folder combined with the ignore would achieve what you wanted. .gitignore only deals with untracked files, so to untrack the files in that folder use: git rm -r --cached drafts

Only tried mycroft once and it was awhile ago so can't really comment other than that I recall the mycroft team saying I'm an AMA that voice processing wasn't completely offline. AFAIK, snips is completely offline after you setup the assistant configuration in their web console. Granted, I believe using offline voice processing limits the accuracy and dictionary of words available, so which assistant you choose probably depends on use case.

Release 0.3.0 Posted to PyPI a new release this morning. It contains support for these widgets: [user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/48280330-46f03080-e421-11e8-9db2-67382b6342d4.jpg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/48280330-46f03080-e421-11e8-9db2-67382b6342d4.jpg) &amp;#x200B; Here is the code that generated the screenshot. "Simple", right? &amp;#x200B; layout = [ [sg.Text('Widgets Currently Supported By PySimpleGUIQt')], [sg.Text('Text', size=(200,35)), sg.Text('Text In Any Color/Font', font=('Courier', 15), text_color='red')], [sg.Text('Single Line Input', size=(200,35)), sg.Input(size=(200,25))], [sg.Text('Multi Line\nInput/Output', size=(200,60)), sg.Multiline(size=(200,75))], [sg.Text('ListBox', size=(200,35)),sg.Listbox(['Listbox 1','Listbox 2','Listbox 3'], size=(200,85)) ], [sg.Text('ComboBox / Dropdown', size=(200,25)),sg.Combo(['Combo item 1',], size=(200,35)) ], [sg.Text('Spinner', size=(200,35)),sg.Spin([1,2,3], size=(40,30)) ], [sg.Text('Checkbox', size=(200,35)), sg.Checkbox('Checkbox') ], [sg.Text('RadioButton', size=(200,35)), sg.Radio('Radio Button', 1) ], [sg.Text('Slider', size=(200,35)), sg.Slider(orientation='h') ], [sg.Text('Button', size=(200,35)), sg.Button('Button') ], [sg.Text('Table', size=(200,35)), sg.Table([[0,1,3,4]])], [sg.Text('Frame', size=(200,35)), sg.Frame('Frame',[[sg.T('')],[sg.T('')]])], [sg.Text('Stdout Output', size=(200,35)), sg.Output(size=(200,75)) ], [sg.Text('Dial', size=(200,35)),sg.Dial(size=(150,75)), sg.Stretch() ], [sg.Button('Blank'), sg.Button('Exit')] ] &amp;#x200B; Instead of 3 or 4 lines of code to make a single Widget, with PySimpleGUI you can have 2 or 3 per ONE line of code. Instead of creating and loading a Qt style sheet, you add a parameter when you place the element into the layout. text\_color='red' is simple, easy to understand. &amp;#x200B;
If its a some assignment, I would suggest start really small. Look at a relatively boiled down version of the same problem (see word break problem) and build up upon the solution. 
List comprehension can get quite a bit confusing. Don't use it too excessively.

If you are googling to Lear about code, google the key part of the code or error message. Don‚Äôt just dump the whole line(s) in.

[Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/tutorial01/)
Python unittest module is... not that great. It was designed a long time ago when Java was more popular and is a lot like JUnit. When you use it you replicate syntax that already exists. Nose and pytest favor asserts and are a lot more Pythonic. 
can I do all the things I mentioned with django.
It really depends on on what they want to get from the course, but if I worked in a funds company and were learning python, I would want to know how to read and write to files, and most especially how to process csv files. So maybe, add an intro to packages and modules (how to use them, not how to write them) and an example with reading/writing csv. &amp;#x200B;
&gt;It opens way faster (1 second vs 15-20 seconds) How often are you closing a project and then reopening it? Launch speed really shouldn't be a factor unless you actually are switching between projects constantly. &gt;I can right click the folder with my data and immediately open VSCode in that folder, rather than having to open PyCharm and File - Open and paste the folder location. That sounds a bit like an anti-pattern of project development, but more common in one off editing. Then again maybe I just don't have enough info about your workflow. 
Don't have calendar :(
I believe there are extensions for making the terminal prettier. &amp;#x200B; Also, the intellisense is pretty good, sometimes its annoying and gets in the way, but it definitely is good.
You mention your PATH and that the module is on the system. What happens if you add the explicit path to the module to your PATH environmental variable? e.g. PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin:/usr/local/Homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin
Additionally, I have had some instances where I had to "re-install" modules to get them to work. Never found a root cause but have had it happen.

The terminal is different because in Pycharm, it's a Python Console. VS Code default is just a plain terminal. [This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39300131/visual-studio-code-python-console#44005596) answer can help you along with integrating a Python console. The autocomplete in your editor is dictated by the linter you have installed. You can do `ctrl+shift+p` then type "linter" to choose the one you want to use. VSCode defaults to pylint, which is decent, however I recommend flake8. There are plenty to choose from, get whatever suits you best. You're witnessing the difference between an editor and an IDE. Neither is inherently "better", however editors start you off with bare-bone features. Anything additional needs to be manually installed (or saved in a settings file). Pycharm is a full on Python IDE, so it assumes you want all these amazing features right off the bat. 
The way I manage this problem is comments. In the same vein as the rest of the article, lots of comments in production code can be messy and get out of date and it's usually better to have self-documenting code. But the tests are VERY small, and specific, and a short human-language description of the test scenario goes a REALLY LONG WAY to relieving the burden of comprehension. This is especially true when a simple test isn't possible or feasible.
I actually got it done! Here's the link if you're interested! [https://youtu.be/o\_yiYpd8NLY](https://youtu.be/o_yiYpd8NLY) /u/Stem3576 and /u/PiBaker Also, I haven't doing python for long, so any suggestions are greatly appreciated :)
Yeah, pycharm isn't really an ad-hoc tool though. By the time you loaded all the plugins into VS code the only difference would be right click to open which is isn't hard to manually add a hook to the right click context menu (depending on OS). 
Exactly. Even more if combined with multiple nested for loops and used for dictionary generation. 
Thanks for reading! &gt;For the same reason you are right on the other points, I want to see the assumptions of the test writer. Having named values prevents me from having to dig through the code to figure out why they used those specific values. Fair point. I generally try to write a test name that conveys intent, but I think there are cases where you can improve clarity by assigning a name to a value that clarifies why it was chosen for the test. I'm more arguing against naming constants for the purely sake of avoiding magic numbers.

Thanks for reading! &gt;For example, an API might require injection or setup of a complex object. There is no way around setting up these objects in tests and developers are loathe to repeat these complex and perhaps fragile object setups in each test instance. I agree with this. I think it's possible to eliminate repetitive code while minimizing complexity. For example, I think that factory or builder patterns are a good way to balance the need to eliminate boilerplate with the need to expose relevant values. For example, I think this is reasonable code to write in a unit test: def make_account_manager_with_single_account(self, username, score): return AccountManager( accounts=[ Account(username=username, name='Dummy User', email='dummy@example.com', score=score), ]) def test_increase_score(self): account_manager = make_account_manager_with_single_account( username='joe123', score=150.0)) account_manager.adjust_score(username='joe123', adjustment=25.0) self.assertEqual(175.0, account_manager.get_score(username='joe123')) It keeps `joe123` and `150.0` in the test body because they're relevant to the test, but buries `Dummy User` and `dummy@example.com` because those values are not. &gt;One thing that is missed by the article is that when these external APIs change, developers often need to manually update each test instance when there is a high level of code repetition. That's a fair point. I had a whole section on this in an earlier draft, but I thought it got too far into the weeds. I feel like developers in general have too strong a bias against repetition in test code. In production code, it's costly to make the same change 10 times. You might miss an instance and introduce a bug. And then every change has a chance of regression, the more instances you change, the greater your chance of a regression. The repeated code is often scattered in many files and hard to find. In test code, it's still tedious to make the same change 10x, but the costs are generally much lower. Often the repetition is all in the same file, and it's usually obvious when you missed one because the test will (hopefully) be broken until you do. You can introduce a bug, but a bug in test code is not as damaging as a bug in production code. So, not to say that repetition is free in test code, but I think developers incorrectly weigh its cost as if they were thinking about repetition in production code.
WTF site is that? What's wrong with [the official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#module-calendar)?
 def test_add_hours(self): TEST_STARTING_HOURS = 72.0 TEST_HOURS_INCREASE = 8.0 hours_tracker = BillableHoursTracker(initial_hours=TEST_STARTING_HOURS) hours_tracker.add_hours(TEST_HOURS_INCREASE) expected_billable_hours = TEST_STARTING_HOURS + TEST_HOURS_INCREASE self.assertEqual(expected_billable_hours, hours_tracker.billable_hours()) 
My reading of PEP-8 is that this is the recommended way to represent constants: &gt;###Constants &gt;Constants are usually defined on a module level and written in all capital letters with underscores separating words. Examples include `MAX_OVERFLOW` and `TOTAL`. https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#constants If I wrote it as test_starting_hours = 72.0 it would look like a normal variable rather than a value that's supposed to be constant.

I'm an engineer that switched to Python. My experience was great.

I've played around with it just occasionally. Nothing that I saw made me want to explore learning anything more about it-- life is short, and the amount of arbitrary BS to wade through on a daily basis just keeps growing.

 If there was a "best" then everyone would use it and there would only be one. There is only "best for" ... which means you need to tell us what you want from a GUI library before we can tell you what's best for you. in a nutshell: * Tkinter: best for super fast development and if you don't want to require your windows users to install extra libraries * pyGTK / PyGObject: best for native looking linux programs. Uses Glade. * PyQT/ PySide: best for highly custom very pretty interfaces and automatic event linking. Looks native on any OS. You can use QTDesigner to create GUIs. * wxPython: Alternative to tkinter for fast and easy interfaces. Has a GTK-like Glade. Recently with python3 support! * Kivy: best for multi-touch and small screens - tablets and phones. * Remi: best for programs that can be accessed via a browser locally or remotely * Bokah: best for interactive data display in a browser. You may also want to think about if your application would work as a web page or a webapp. That would allow any user with a browser to use your service without installing anything (locked computers, terminals, mobile). To do that look into some python web frameworks like Flask or Django. 
I learned Python on the job by seeing my coworker‚Äôs code, getting code review feedback, and googling when I had more questions. I haven‚Äôt read any Python books because I haven‚Äôt felt the need. I have spent a lot of time with Python‚Äôs documentation because I‚Äôve found it to be much better than any blog I‚Äôve found. That said, why restrict yourself to just the documentation? Use whatever resources are available to get the job done.
No, there are so many variations of kernels/libraries which make it a complex mess. It's far easier for you to compile it on your system.
Of course there's not the "best of all"; anyway thanks for the reply it was really helpful and complete! Yes i'm actually doing some experiments to check what can i reach in UI without using a web interface (for that i tried Django some time ago). For the moment i started with Guizero, which implements Tkinter and it seems interesting but i'm actually really interested in PyQt too
For me, an accountant who wants to automate a lot of my tedious daily tasks, I feel as though the official documentation may go into more detail than what I need.

https://pythonclock.org/
The official docs are basically detailed reference material. They show correct parameters and some usage examples, but they are not necessarily great training or tutorial material (at least in my experience). I think other books and stuff give you a better idea of *why* you would use one thing over another and more importantly how to put it all together into something useful.
Yeah, sorry I thought this was the neuron extension, not the main vscode python extension
YouTube and the docs for reference. Worked for me. 
If you're on windows, there are plenty of python libraries that upload wheels or eggs, ex lxml.
You have to understand that it's not because a dev compiled it on his/her machine that it will work on yours. This is especially true for linux as there are more variation on the systems. Usually the problem is that developers have new machines/OS, and this often implies it won't work on older ones: Say I have a machine that have AVX instructions, and GCC 7 compiler, it is likely that my compiler will be smart enough to optimize some things to work faster with AVX, and do some clever, but then people without AVX can't run the wheel, and if another library is compiled with GCC6, they are not compatible. So for example, for a long time, numpy dev were "hunting" for old machine/old compiler, to have maximum compatibility. New machine/compilers understand "older" binaries, but not the opposite. On the flip side if you build with an old machine, it has many chances to work; but this mean an installed wheel rarely make full use of a recent machines capabilities ‚Äì and we can talk about order of magnitude in speed. There is also the multi-os issues. It is relatively hard to compile on Mac for Windows/Linux, an vice-versa. So usually you will not find wheels; except for machine the dev has. If you want more info, I would suggest to google for "manylinux wheel" you'll see some discussion on how some people manages to get wheels on linux, and that more-or less summarize what all the issues are. It is getting more and more common to use Continuous Integration tools (Circle CI, Travis CI, Appveyor) and Containers like Docker to go around this problem, but it is a hard one =, and little funding go to this problem. Note that conda packages are to a large approximation wheels, and that conda-forge is a community that try to make building python packages across architectures easier, by automatizing CI, building pipeline, and providing a "single" virtual platform to ensure all packages are compatible. 
Marshmallow will do what you want
I learned python mostly using the documentation and just testing everything, however googling pretty much everything I didn't understand was also a big part. Since the beginning I have also gotten very good at skimming text for information I need but that is not necessarily a good thing since I can't read a book without having the urge to just skim over it for the important plot points

It's cool man
Thanks for the heads up. I'll give it a try.
Have seen these "Unofficial Windows Binaries"? https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ 
This site is great unless you're on Python 3.6 or 3.7. A number of the libraries there stop at 3.5.
Awesome repo.
IPython notebooks store more than just the code; they store all of the data present in the global namespace. This make for a persistent "workspace" and an iterative workflow that is quite different from using an IDE and the python interpreter on it's own. Use an IDE to develop, test, and deploy modules that you then import into your Jupyter sessions.
Actually, Haskell language is implemented in this one library. Very interesting! Good job!
I think you could use this to do it in one pass if one of the many "method" functions suits your needs. https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.interpolate.html#pandas-series-interpolate

This isn't really related to Python

This is something that's shorthand in a lot of functional languages, I'm familiar with it in Scala. Primarily, I think, it's an expression allowing you to assign the results which you can't do with, for example, an of statement. (Thus it falls nicely into map statements and the like. It's also nicer looking than the alternatives, usually.) Scala has other functions built around it, such as auto unpacking values that match into useable values as well, along with a structure for defining user types that allow such unpacking.

This is still kinda true? but most only require 8 compiles to hit 90% of systems (mac, manylinux, 64 bit windows and 32 bit windows) on both python 3.5+ compat and python 2.7. If there are weird compile-time deps or flags, then yeah it becomes weird, but that's sort of the special case, most binary modules could be compiled with 8 times and uploaded as wheels with little downside. (mind you 8 times is still a lot of times if you don't have CI setup...)

Not directly related to your question however have you considered running uploaded scripts in an isolated environment such as docker instead? Historically restricting anything only works to a certain degree considering how dynamic Python is. If the malicious actor is determined enough, restrictions can be bypassed. Even an isolated environment can be escaped however it is more technically difficult so the risk is reduced. If your objective is security this might be something for you to consider.

Thanks, that took care of it. I had actually read that thread earlier but missed that they were attaching it to the file instead of the message.
My inclination is if you're not sure you should be using `numpy`. What sort of work are you doing? Why are you considering using `torch.tensor`? Unless you're using PyTorch/doing machine learning you probably are fine to stick with `numpy`. If you're doing distributed computations but not within a machine learning framework perhaps you're interested in something like `dask`?

It's just a text file that it's reading, a poem, even though i named it img. It's just strings. 
The URL im using is: [http://www.py4inf.com/code/romeo-full.txt](http://www.py4inf.com/code/romeo-full.txt)
Is info a list or something you can iterate over?
Info is the chunks of characters being read, 512 at a time. [info=text.read](https://info=text.read)(buffer\_size) its not a list, just a string of characters
Oh I see you are printing the entire info block try printing character instead
I need to print the entire info block until it reachers 3000 characters then it should stop. Heres the assignment from the professor: 1. Count the number of characters received, and stop displaying any text after it has shown ***exactly*** 3000 characters. Since your chunk size will not divide evenly into 3000, you will need to add some logic to ensure that exactly 3000 characters (no more, and no less) are displayed. 2. Continue to retrieve the entire document, count the total number of characters, and display (i.e., *print*) the total number of characters. 
I know this all too well, and i've burned myself badly this time. Thank you
Yea I understand but why not print the entire block,one character at a time,until 3000 is reached and then it will just stop,printing then.
Yes https://pastebin.com/VB8QRXbu
You have your arguments wrong when you call `post_balance = acc_interest(num/100, year, init_balance)` You defined it as `acc_interest(cur_balance, rate, years)`

Another similar thing you can do is derive a class from namedtuple, like class Derived(namedtuple('Derived', ('x', 'y', 'z'))): pass I like that if you want the `__init__` for free along with immutability and access by index, along with being able to check equality and all that. [Similar memory usage too](https://repl.it/@darkarchon/ExtraneousBogusRuby) Size of namedtuple: 168 Size of slots class: 160 Size of class derived from namedtuple: 176 Size of normal class: 432
Genuine curiosity is often a good reason to ask what X can be used for. People with no prior knowledge of pattern matching will obviously not know how and where it could benefit them. In such a case it's pretty standard to ask about the purpose.

&gt; The pre-processing basically consists in loading molecules using a module that is a C++ library (OpenBabel) wrapped in Python to build graphs, assign parameters, and store properties in 1D arrays. This data will be then used by the C++/OpenCL code to be written &amp;#x200B;
The underlying implementation seems very similar to the now deprecated pseudohashes in Perl. I like how these prevent invalid attribute access when setting attributes. I might consider using them just to help prevent those sorts of bugs.

Based on this: &gt;The pre-processing basically consists in loading molecules using a module that is a C++ library (OpenBabel) wrapped in Python to build graphs, assign parameters, and store properties in 1D arrays. This data will be then used by the C++/OpenCL code to be written it sounds like your primary goal should just be formatting the output from your Python code in a way that's easily deserializable by C++, which, if this is just flat arrays, sounds like a CSV. If that's the case I wouldn't shy away from making your Python code pythonic. If I'm reading into that incorrectly and your new developer will actually be fully porting your Python code to C++, then that's a bit different, and the path you took is probably just fine (though to be fair: I haven't written C++ in a couple of years, and my Python is admittedly a little rusty). As far as the suggestion your co-worker had to avoid designing functions returning tuples or multi variables, and multi-dimensional arrays: I say that's bogus. Since the days of C, C++ has had structs and unions, which are perfect for making simple data classes (i.e. tuples) to return multiple variables and/or using them as parameters. It's a very common pattern and I don't think it should necessarily be ignored. The same goes for multidimensional arrays: they're used in essentially the same way in both languages (in my opinion, anyway)

I totally forgot my advice: write clear code. Name quantities, variables, and functions, appropriately. Avoid some more esoteric pythonisms e.g. metaclasses and extreme dynamic typing. Generators should be fine as long as it is clear what they do.

&gt; IPython notebooks store more than just the code; they store all of the data present in the global namespace This sentence is a bit misleading since the data from a notebook session is not stored the .ipynb-file. If you have data that should be stored between sessions you need to store this to disk yourself.
Neat idea and looks well executed, it's just a shame Python's syntax doesn't have the space to really make this look clear. I'd probably err on the side of not using this just because it's complex and noisy, while I use pattern matching all the time in Scala without concern about someone else struggling to understand it. For those who are struggling to understand the utility of it (which I understand again because of Python syntax), I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on it in something like Scala: https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/pattern-matching.html
This is a tiny tiny part of Haskell, most of it would be impossible to implement on top of Python's type system.
&gt; How would I, a dyed-in-the-wool procedural coder, use your library You wouldn't. Just as dyed-in-the-wool GOTO users in 1970 wouldn't be caught dead using these new-fangled "procedures" and "functions". But as an open-minded coder willing to try new idioms from functional programming *wink* you might consider replacing code that looks like this: # pseudocode, natch if input matches this case: do this return x elif input matches that case: do that return y elif input matches something else: do something else return z else: return the default with pattern matching syntax. Pattern matching is like a souped-up case statement, without the C "fall through by default" design mistake, and where each case is matched using not just basic operations like `=`, but a rich pattern-matching syntax which is conceptually similar to globbing or regexes, except it applies to arbitrary values. In the pseudo-code example above, consider the "match this case" test.. Here's a concrete (but made up) example: isinstance(value, tuple) and len(value) &gt; 1 and value[0] is None That might be expressable in pattern-match syntax as: match (None, _) meaning "the input is a tuple, and the first item is None, and there's at least one more item".

If your goal is to get a fast tool, written in C++, but prototyped in python, then check out [cython](https://cython.org/), which lets you write Python that compiles to C (which is valid C++). It could work for you, and you wouldn't have to change how you code too much, maybe.

The preprocessing can be as pythonic as you want. Don't spend time trying to get your preprocessing to a translatable state. &amp;#x200B; For the performant section avoid list comprehensions, do your iterations in distinct for loops where you iterate through the array by calling the index directly instead of the standard "for item in list\_a:", most programmers will know to fill in the blanks, but it's easy to make an error when transcribing. If you really want to see if things will translate well, test your performant functions by prefixing them in a numba "@jit(nopython=True)". It will throw an error if it can't run the code without the interpreter. It's not fullproof, but it's a good way to at least see if your code will translate well. &amp;#x200B; Since you're not importing any outside libraries, you shouldn't have too much to worry about except when using lists be careful to just treat them as individual array as you can get in the habit of just throwing anything in them since it fits, haha.
While this is true for most libs - I get to find linux\_py36 and even windows\_x86\_py36 and windows\_x64\_py36 - but I still can't find variants like linux\_cuda\_py36 or linux\_avx\_py36 even though using dlib with cuda is a real common setup for systems with GPU.
&gt; code typing must be enabled manually from the settings before writing anything Uhh, what. Also, I'd look into [Thonny](https://thonny.org/).
VSCode 
Often people are stuck with problems that come from nowhere while compiling, which they can't solve with the help of google, stackoverflow and other forums. This would require the creator's help as he would often be the only one who knows the solution, or even worse, he doesn't know why that's happening too. An example would be [https://github.com/davisking/dlib/issues/1547](https://github.com/davisking/dlib/issues/1547) which I just raised last night and the reality is, I won't probably get any help, leaving me with no choice but to choose some other library.
I did a reddit img download script to scrape some of my favorite subreddits for images. Nothing special but it works great so far.
&gt;i.e. an IDE that is good for the beginners and for learning - doesnt block and push back beginners but at the same time can be used for real life projects. As its free, lots of plugins, good dev speed and updates etc will I say that I have very little reason not to recommend it for everyone that looking for a new IDE.
Check out Jupyter &amp; see if you like the mechanics of the notebook style. &amp;#x200B; Personally I like VSCode since the autocomplete is good which is useful when you don't really know what things are called. &amp;#x200B; Absolutely hated Eclipse, but that might just be me.
Not sure I needed that TIL
Because Linux is fundamentally different to Windows, and there are many distributions and set-ups for them. It's not one os called Linux, there are numerous (although related) Linux ones. 
Great feedback! Thanks, I will make those changes.
Oh that's quite cool. Want to build something that auto-seeds new linux distros as they get released.
Plain text editor, possibly with keyword highlighting.
+ plugins: microsoft-python &amp; microsoft python language server
Thoughts on py2web? When I was googling this it seemed like it might be easier than flask
I would recommend Thonny to my grandpa if he started programming. It acts as toy but it's a perfect tool to use 
yes, after installing cant type - then you need to google to find the solution and then you need to uncheck something from the settings to get it working, im sure great minds were behind this product but too great for my taste https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31757345/cannot-type-in-terminal-window Go to the tools and uncheck the vim emulator. It will work.
This is bad for you, go find proper training on edx for example.
Did you enable all the plugins when installing or something? IdeaVim is off by default. 
How does the distribution impact how the executable runs? Surely only the kernel matters.
Hi, if you are a beginner if you're on Windows, maybe you can start with something 'all in one'. by 'all in one' I mean Python distribution and IDE. I can start with WinPython. You will find Spyder included. I think it's a good starting point. Hope it helps a bit Regards
It does also save time though. For normal classes attribute lookup has to go through a dict, which is slow (fun fact, hash tables are slower than iterating through an array checking each item for small sets of 10 to 100 items, depending on implementation). Python's dict has been optimized to death and Python's not exactly fast to begin with, but I can imagine some situations where the time savings is significant.
The kernel is by and large irrelevant. What matters is which libraries are installed, and in which version. The preference on Linux is to use dynamic linking against shared libraries, rather than distribute massive static linked packages. 
That's what I thought, but in practice it does not work and the --proxy command is invalid. 
Just forget about \`\_\_slots\_\_\`. The future is probably PyPi optimizing things for you.
nice thumbnail 
i use intellij and it's good so far
More like: windows has a specific version, and it's always in the same place.
On the SciPy side, it took "only" 16 years to find a solution to `pip install scipy` working out-of-the-box on Win machines. Watch Ralf [describing here](https://youtu.be/oHmm3mPxg6Y?t=1139). There are just too many permutations to keep track of OS, \[32, 64\], compiler type, compiler version, lib dependency(MKL, OpenBLAS, ..., ATLAS etc.) and many many more parameters. Not to fingerpoint at the following, they are quite valid issues but just to give an example of the spectrum we are operating in, two recently reported issues [https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/9441](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/9441) [https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/9452](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/9452) I recommend you to count the items in their toolchains mentioned in just these two issues. To some we don't even have access to, such as still active HPC clusters from 90s with their own configs. If you put something out there, it is going to be there forever so it should better work and work for everyone. That stability guarantee is \*the\* most difficult promise to make given the number of flavors of everything, permuted. And we don't have the luxury to turn down problems with "You should have used &lt;insert someone else's config&gt;". Well maybe they can't. On something a subject like CUDA, that is also hardware dependent I wouldn't dare to release any wheels if I am absolutely sure that I've tested every possible CUDA using thing out there.
The hired programmer will probably also be very grateful if you make use of type hints in Python. 
Wheels are compiled. They need to compile a matrix of builds to satisfy all platforms. The onus is better put on you. You, at develop and build time, pip install and build them for your current platform yourself. You can then build and bundle your app, or a Docker image, etc. You shouldn't be pip installing at run time, so the added time of not having binaries shouldn't matter.
I'd like to do like this but my teacher prohibited this technique
&gt;why not just write it in c++ directly They don't have the C++ programmer yet. And that programmer may not know enough to "\[get\] the science right".
Thanks, It was so easy that i didn't think to this solution. Tnx for your reply
based on your requirements this solution is the correct answer. If you want to make it longer you will just be adding in necessary steps. if you want to do it more like your first solution start with 4444 and subtract a random number between 0 and 3333 - though this is a considerably worse way of achieving this 
1) Be explicit with your data types. Encode the type in the variable name if it helps you stay consistent. 2) Don't do the usual data science with Python thing where everything is dicts of lists of dicts of (etc), indexed by names or numbers or both. Instead, put your data into simple classes and nest them as necessary. 3) Make it explicit when data is passed to a function and intended to be modified, versus being passed in purely as a read-only argument. 4) You may also need to avoid exceptions. Many C++ programmers don't use exceptions as they can be less efficient than the alternatives such as error codes.
Pycharm. I am not sure what you are having issues with but that comes ready to go. type code and right click run, that should be it! I started with pycharm and use it daily now as a pro. 
Is ok with this or is there an easier way to do it? &amp;#x200B;
Seems like a decent intro video to me.
i think you missed my point, must be working as a programmer ? do you buy a car which has breaks disabled by default 
No he means you enabled the vim thing in the settings when you installed pycharm, you enabled the vim plugin.
I'm less and less a fan of Anaconda Python for my work; but admittedly, it's great for beginners and it comes with Spyder, which is a very straightforward IDE with all the main functionalities you'd want, and it works out of the box.
&amp;#x200B;
Wow thanks. This is a lot better than the Notepad++ I was using lol.
vscode = G.O.A.T.
These are the technologies needed to build robots and make the global economy work more efficiently. IMHO robots will profoundly change the world within a generation, so it‚Äôs probably a good career choice. Well ‚Äî that is until they become so smart that they decide that you are no longer needed ;). On the bright side, you would be the one of the last humans that they make redundant.
I read readme and saw a couple of talks on topic but yet to understand why I would need that.
Do check out Mu. It might be good if you are just getting started . https://codewith.mu 
This might be one of my oldest bookmarks. Good list
\&gt; As far as the suggestion your co-worker had to avoid designing functions returning tuples or multi variables, and multi-dimensional arrays: I say that's bogus. Yes I had the same thought. But a python tuple I think is more free-form than a struct, so you'd probably want to be mindful of the limitations of structs when structuring the return data.
&gt; W3schools is a good all around reference for lots of programming topics. 1. No, it really isn't. It's not as bad as it used to be, but it's still a mediocre site that implies it's somehow "official" by using the name "W3". It's _not_ official in any way, and it has put a _ton_ of programmers on the wrong path. 1. If W3 Schools is useful for anything, it's for _web_ development concepts. There's no reason whatsoever to use it as a resource for a well-documented, general-purpose programming language like Python. 1. But that's not even what you've linked to! You've linked to w3 _resource_, an obviously amateur site that has published some scraped version of Python's documentation. It isn't even clear what version of Python is being documented! That site is basically blogspam. Don't reward its authors by liking to it.

Several months ago I tried to write a class that would introspect on its `__slots__` and automatically generate an `__init__` method for you. However I couldn't figure out how to actually generate a function or method. e.g. I wanted to do something like this @from_slots def MyCls: __slots__ = ('a', 'b') I know that [attrs achieves this by overriding __setattr__](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/how-does-it-work.html#slots-classes), but it would be interesting to see if actually generating Python code was possible. I know that namedtuple *used to* generate and eval source code, but apparently that's no longer how it's implemented in CPython, so I'm holding out hope that it's possible.
Do you have an alternative?
A rasberry pi, actually paying for a vps or a hosting service
Doesnt heroku restart every single script every 24 hours?
so far vscode is looking pretty good, they also have built in tutorials https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-django
Place in a temporary data structure that will hold the data that will be listed. If the data size meets the requirements then print it. Or you may create a dictionary to hold each block where the key is the character position and the value is the block of data. 
Not another video. Doesn't anyone read any more?
I found it to be the best free service out there.
Obviously, you can do what you want to do, in pointing out there are far better alternatives to it
Google for "Python linter".
If you don't know how Vim works, it's not PyCharm fault. Don't install plugins you don't know you need. Don't toggle options you don't know. These are the rules for beginners to follow when using IDEs.
There you go buddy "[https://www.lfd.uci.edu/\~gohlke/pythonlibs/](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/)". You'll find most - if not all- of what you're looking for in there.
It is ok for a free service, im saying that if you pay for a cheap vps or if you have a rasberry pi lying around, its far better than heroku if you read my points above
Python is a great tool for building things, but often times you'll need some domain specific knowledge to go with it. You can do web development in python too, look up Django. I think getting into that and being a proficient developer in that space can easily be a solid career choice. I would recommend though that you learn some basic front end skills, basic networking, and a slew of other things. But on the plus side, there is no shortage of help and resources for it. If you want to learn more about those, just ask for what kind you need and I'd be happy to point you in the right direction. 
Hell, the last time i checked, a vps costed 2.99 usd, is that too much compared to the overwhelming downsides of heroku?

I'd recommend sticking with just a decent text editor and the command-line toolchain (`python`, `pip`, `virtualenv`, and maybe `ipython`). Python is concise enough to be perfectly usable this way, and you won't have to learn the IDE on top of learning the language and its toolchain. IDEs also have a tendency to obscure the underlying mechanisms, so you might never learn what it is the IDE does for you, and then when things go wrong, you often won't understand why, and you won't be able to fix them.
Don‚Äôt know why someone downvoted you, but pycharm is really good
I'm reading your comment right now.

Or pillow, or pygame, or numpy, etc. It's mostly the more recent scientific libraries that haven't caught on yet because scientists are terrible at packaging. (I'm gonna go hide now so said scientists don't send their AI assassins to take me out.)
about an hour has passed and Django seems to be installed already, i find it ok for a beginner if it initially blocks the transfer of Django install and you are on Opera, SSL needs to be checked as a transfer method , tutorial of the error here https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-make-sure-the-ssl-tls-protocols-are-enabled 
started using Vscode and seems very helpful because it has the built in tutorials, i have got Django installed properly it seems, i find the built in tutorials to be good idea because because this way i know what i need to know )) https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-django https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-make-sure-the-ssl-tls-protocols-are-enabled i figured that i will install a basic version of a framework - making im not missing anything fundamental - and try to build on it there 
The objects imported from [ElectricCars.py](https://ElectricCars.py) are basically just numbers of EV sorted in different lists :)
I use visual studio pro. Mostly because I do c# as well and it is nice to do it all in one IDE. 
There's some details about slots that are left out here. The two big ones are: 1. If you inherit from a slots class and don't declare slots yourself, you don't get a slots class. 2. When you make a slots class, you can't weakref it unless you add `__weakref__` to the slots. And something fun, if you add `__dict__` to slots, then you get back that attribute and can set whatever you want on the class again. 
Some people learn better visually / by example. 
Spyder is my jam. Installs easily through Anaconda 
Pycharm (and all jetbrains IDEs) provide an education plugin with courses/tutorials on learning various languages the problem you had with typing sounds like you installed a vim plugin when you installed the IDE. that isn't pycharm's fault but your own. vim plugins exist for every major IDE and editor. if you install it in any of them, the same thing will happen. it's generally a good idea to avoid installing something if you don't know what it is the difference between IDEs and editors is that IDEs have just about everything you need by default. they are bulkier and more intimidating, but you don't have to spend as much time setting them up. editors are stripped down and feel faster at first because their functionality depends heavily on plugins. so while it might be less intimidating, you will have to spend more time searching, installing, and configuring plugins to get a usable environment Sublime text is an editor with python support out of the box. VSCode is the cool kid at the moment, but you will have to do more to setup a dev environment 
I second Jupyter Notebooks as a great option for learning (although not an IDE). When I was going through online Python classes (MS datascience curriculum, pluralsight, lynda), I would create new Notebooks for each of the different types of collections, file management, classes, modules, functions. For datascience, I created Notebooks for data prep, wrangling, visualizations, Numpy arrays, pandas... I use these Journals now as examples to return to, and add, append new examples I run across. Works great as a personal reference. You can add markdown formatted text with links for standard notes that are easier to read than code comments. I also really like VSCode as an IDE.
as i understand pycharm is a good thing in general, just not very good for beginners but Vscode can be upgraded to have Pycharm-like features? https://old.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9vnc0r/any_way_to_get_pycharmquality_intellisense/
https://pythondiscord.com/
just posting here for other beginners and later referrals, i think i found what im looking for Vscode and stay quiet for now 
Not likely. Try debugging using pdb or PyCharm.
You could learn enough about popular, high-level data science tools within two years - and, at that point, you're basically printing money.
This is a fine answer for the question asker, but I just wanted to point out for learners to know...VSCode isn't really an IDE, going by what most experienced developers would call an IDE. 
That's what mypy *does*. 
Generally, there are three areas that hire Python programmers: Data Science/Machine Learning, Web Development, and Pentesting/Cyber Security
&gt; I‚Äôve got around 2 years left to decide my future. You can do whatever you want when you want. It's somewhat harder to switch careers when you're older, but it's way worse to get get pressured down paths you don't want to go. FWIW, I switched careers into software development in my mid 30s and despite some ageism it wasn't too bad and now I'm pretty successful. Note, though, that I've programmed as a hobby since my early teens but I feel fairly confident that I would've been able to make the switch even if I hadn't kept up with programming for decades. 
Neat! I wish Python has this builtin into the language :)

Working on parsing json data from api to oracle tables. 
I don't know for sure but I'd expect because java runs on the java vm, versus python linking to system libraries. In java I believe (I may be wrong) that a jar can contain all your dependencies, so now the only thing that matters is the version of java that's running. If I build a jar using java 11, it'll run on every single java 11 no matter the os, architecture, etc. Python doesn't have the stable, constant vm to run on though. Now you need a framework unique to each os. Take Linux alone, maybe it links against libc. What version of libc does a distro ship with? What options was it compiled with? 
I learn better by example, and I grok examples better by following videos. People learn different in ways.
And what is your point here? I have 9 working stations, with a maximum total number of cars with amount of 26197 being randomly distributed to this 9 stations. So if this doesnt work, how should i solve it then? Perhaps divide 26197 by 2 = 13099 and then divide the 9 stations on 2 different lists again?
QA uses Python pretty extensively because the language has a wrapper for a ton of things. So it an easy way to get stuff done. There are also some very nice frameworks to help with full automaton of tests.
Lol thanks
Thanks :)
Use type annotations not Hungarian notation. 
They don't need to know the exact science, but they should be knowledgeable enough to understand the basic building blocks. If your algorithm makes heavy use of linear algebra, then your programmer must too. If they go "what's a matrix?", then I think you'll have a very bad time...
For example defining a class attribute that you intend to use as a count of instances, which is something that will change during runtime. What is the lifecycle of your class during runtime? This makes it harder to reason about your program. Your intention was to showcase a class attribute in comparison to an instance attribute. Ideally you would use class attributes for attributes that are constant across the instances, such as a code for the school etc. If you want to keep track of state you should encapsulate that in a separate object build for that purpose. Nothing fancy, a list of students would do. I know this is supposed to be a basic tutorial but beginners should not get used to this style.

Assign the value to to_be_moved after you update the list instead of before. You‚Äôre not updating to_be_moved by updating the variable that the value of to_be_moved comes from, if that makes sense.

This isn‚Äôt actually true. Industrial automation is what you‚Äôre looking for, an associates and some grease under your nails and you‚Äôre hired.
Thanks for the tip I'll consider using docker together with RestrictedPython
I would like to know more - I‚Äôm in my early 30s and would like to switch and have been hobby programming for a decade
The memory improvements are brought up. That said, there are speed improvements as well, especially when needing to mass create objects via c extensions, ex numpy.

Are you talking about this? http://www.web2py.com. just googling quick brought up that and some weird chess thing called py2web. Either way I've never heard of either.
Damn dude what kool aid are you drinking?
I'm confused by your question. You're meant to use mypy by running it directly on your codebase -- it analyzes it and prints out any type errors it detects. If mypy is unable to find the location of a given file you're importing, it'll tell you. If the inferred return value of a function does not match the return annotation you added, mypy will also tell you. Apart from a few exceptions, mypy is capable of parsing and analyzing arbitrary Python code. Was there something that was missing when you tried using mypy?

I like that it gives me some level of guarantee about what attributes the class will have. It's "less mutable", which is a plus to me when passing around data.
As a note the code that it generates that isn't already written as C/C++ is translated to Python specific C/C++. You'll get a lot of CPython c types like Py_Long or Py_Unicode or whatever, which probably isn't what this guy wants. What this guy wants is to more or less find a (or be a manual) transpiler-- to that I say, you'd have to map Python built in and stdlib items to C++ ones.
Replying from PC, this is a placeholder
The tldr is that you don't have to worry about your dependent libraries' licenses as long as they're open-source and not under the GPL. Pick a license to use, read it and make sure you understand what you're giving away, and then distribute it. If you use something that's GPLed then things get more complicated. The GPL is viral - it has a clause (in its very long text) saying essentially that any other software that uses this has to also be under the GPL. (The language is written around C programs, but it's generally accepted that dependencies in a language like Python also count.) Unfortunately you have no hope of reading through the GPL and understanding it yourself, but the FSF does have a good faq.
Yeah I‚Äôve been kind of doing that, I had one interview so far with a whiteboard portion, I didn‚Äôt know SQL well enough and wasn‚Äôt allowed to google any syntax so I failed it. That was a little discouraging. Right now I run my own business doing technical writing and am going back to school (got accepted into a masters program for Math). Think I‚Äôm going to keep building my portfolio because I suspect I‚Äôm going to have to move if I want an entry level software engineering job.
Ah in that case, you will probably need to exec a function. 
Oh wow, this comes remarkably close to what I want
regarding CUDA, it might be that bundling CUDA with your software and shipping is illegal except when you have a special agreement with NVIDIA (like PyTorch or TensorFlow)
If you hire a programmer who is quasi-competent he'll prefer it if you write nice idiomatic readable python code. He's not going to be doing some sort of line-by-line translation of your code - he'll be trying to understand the structure of the code so that he can reproduce it as idiomatic C++. Making the 'python' code more C++-like will just make his life harder as he'll have to spend effort trying to figure out if you did something because there was a reason, or because you thought it would help him. If you really want to make his life easier, write a bunch of test cases with expected inputs and outputs that he can translate easily to C++ and use to validate his new code.
End goal is a virtual environment to run a website
Thank you for your response. I had read about Django and Flask in terms of web development, and surely that‚Äôs a good option to follow. Learning JavaScript, HTML &amp; CSS, Python etc is what one of my friends has recently suggested, and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm gonna learn soon enough. However, after reading other replies, a very interesting field caught my eye, cyber security. It would be incredibly appreciated if you light a path through this field, and by that I only mean some names. Something like ‚ÄúGo Learn This Go Learn That‚Äù. Your help is deeply appreciated. I‚Äôve always had this habit of planning things this far ahead, not that I don‚Äôt want to do anything wrong, but to do everything the right way.
What about [https://stackoverflow.com/a/33112180](https://stackoverflow.com/a/33112180) ? You can use a generic init like the one I posted, and then change it's signature. You could make a dummy wrapper in the decorator and set it's signature from cls.\_\_slots\_\_ and some sort of types lookup.
Scientific packages are also much more likely to be heterogeneous when it comes to the source language, which makes the compilation toolchain larger and more complex.
Thank you for your response. Well yeah, I just heard that there‚Äôs this AI which writes codes regardless of a human‚Äôs interaction. That‚Äôs convincing :-P Is it right that the same technologies are used for cryptography? Considering how hot the digital currencies are these days, could it be some career worth investing time in?
&gt; but instead what I'm asking for is a solution that can help us make use of all the effort people put in developing a library in as many platforms and variants as possible. But that already exists: Python.
No real end goal right now. Just playing with data. 
Thank you for your response. I‚Äôm 26, but apparently have 2 obligated years I need to serve in military services. Good thing is I‚Äôve got half the day to myself and that‚Äôs the time I‚Äôm talking about. And an special thanks for pointing out the age issue in workplace. That I had in mind for quite a while assuming the industry reaches out for early 20s most of the times.
Let me know how it goes, I love getting into the nitty gritty of Python and doing weird stuff with it.
thx, I aprreciate
I got it, unfortunately I just found how reddit much better than [stackoverflow.](https://stackoverflow.It) &amp;#x200B;
I wrote an automatic Java to C++ converter, and want to write a Python to C++ converter so I've been thinking about the constructs that are hard. A generator is not too hard IF it is simple and only 1 instance (then you use static variables), otherwise you transform it into a class. Annotations will simplify the conversion, and if you are using classes, put everything that is self. inside the constructor (even if you just assign null to it)
Wow thank you so much! And thanks for the disclaimer üòú
Thanks for the response. I'll be honest its still all going way over my head, I wasn't even aware I might need to pick a licence for my own code until reading you post though I definitely should have thought of that. I suppose the first step is to check if any of the libraries fall under GPL. 
I'm unsure whether or not your approach works. However, I'd advise checking out the `del` keyword: ``` #we declare a variable named foo: foo = 2 #foo can be used print(foo) #foo #we delete it: del foo #foo can no longer be used: print(foo) #NameError ``` Hopefully, you understood my example and this is the sort of thing you were looking for. Let us know if it suits your needs, OP!

Awesome! Also, how did you make your blog?
It helps to not only read the start page if you refer to documenation. Flask is a good example of a very small python library and a huge amount of documentation. From reading the Flask documentation you can learn alot about web programming in general (and its application with Flask). I do not understand your rant at all.
Thanks dude!
r/learnpython 
Do you mean \*free\* use? If so you can just release your code under the GPL and not worry about anything.
Just do some personal projects and work with a company or just publish a paper that you actually implemented. Then you will definitely get a decent job. Or, Invent something in robotics field and get a patent. Make sure it's marketable. Then no one can stop you.
Can't be bothered to read the sidebar?
Dataclasses rock
The requests package and cURL can both follow redirects. Hope that helps!
I mean...yes, I think? I don't intend to charge people for it and don't really mind if people go on to use my amateurish code for other things - the only thing that has any real value that I wouldn't want people to use without referencing me are the art assets.
Absolutely not Flask can be used for dynamic sites. The LinkedIn website uses Flask for example. You use flask to handle all the http requests and talk to the database to make it dynamic. And then you can add JavaScript in as you please.
Why not try it and find out?
Check the repository [https://github.com/aelmosalamy/ascii-combat](https://github.com/aelmosalamy/ascii-combat) I appreciate PRs
Hey! I think you can try to go through these two pages: - http://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org/introduction/what_is_di.html - http://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org/introduction/di_in_python.html I hope you could find more answers there!
What kind of request do you expect from service A? HTTP? If yes, you could use some simple framework for processing incoming requests, for example Flask - very popular and very agile framework with huge community - http://flask.pocoo.org After you will implement entry point with Flask you need to extract request‚Äôs parameters. Next, you need to make a request to service B with transfer some data through HTTP. Here you could use POST request with data placed in body of request. For making POST requests you could you requests library - http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/ It‚Äôs very simple library. After B will response you, you need to validate response‚Äôa data and put it to return function. It‚Äôs very high level design, because your question contain few information, but I hope links to Flask and Requests help you.

OK, you had a typo. If what you want is credit, the GPL would be a good idea. More permissive licenses also require credit, but they might be ignored more than the GPL would.
Yes, Jar do get all the dependencies bundle; You can do the same with Python but it's usually not how Python is used. In Java you can "compile" everything into a Jar and you are done. While in Python you can do Dynamic import. Java is better suited for "applications", you know ahead of time what you like; while in Python you usually say "oh, I'm going to install IPython and Numpy", later you want to "add" pandas, without having to re-download and bundle IPython and Numpy. This is also roughly what happens with `.exe` you mostly bundle all. When installing libraries independently, you indeed need to have often (even on windows), the same version of the compiler be used for all libraries that might interact together. Different system do have different trade-off, so there are no right- or wrong way of doing things. Just shifting where the difficulties are.

&gt; I'm pretty sure the benefit of slots is not in saving time, but in saving memory. Would have been good to see how much memory an instance takes up with and without slots. That's in there, unless the article changed since you posted. 
so you discovered RDBMS....
github it man
Wish I could but it doesn't follow terms of service requests and I don't want the process to get blocked. 
ok...what's wrong with it ?
Nice! I am working on something similar, but am automating the download of transactions, categorization of transactions, and updating my google docs budget sheet, including sending myself a summary email. I should write a blog post about it, yours looks great! Here is code in case you are interested in incorporating any into yours. It gets old typing in every transaction individually ;) https://github.com/danshorstein/py-budget
One problem with type annotations is that it's not always clear what type the variable is at the point of use. Type hinting is for tools, not for programmers. A good IDE bridges that gap, but so does just naming the variable to include the type. It's ugly but this is an unusual situation.
for strictly identical images, you can simply hash them.
You don't really need both. Docker does everything you need and does it better.
Are the past mailings on a blog or something?
i was thinking to do that way from urls...to analize online images 
The idea is that regardless when you signup, you'll always start the series from email 1 and progress from them. As I write emails, I'll also upload them on my website as a backup.
Thank you, I'll check out your project. Automatic entry and categorization would be really nice. I was also thinking about using AI to process the description field for automatic categorization. But the problem with automatic entry is that most people have multiple accounts and occasionally use cash. So completely avoiding manual entry doesn't seem possible to me. Anyway definitely send me a message if you write a blog post about it.
Yeah I mean that's machine learning in a nutshell :)
Thanks, appreciate it :)
Not sure what you mean, but I stand by my previous statement: if your programmer doesn't understand the domain they are working in, you are going to have problems. If they would be confused by numpy arrays, I would seriously doubt that they could ever implement anything useful (in this context). And to be clear: by domain knowledge I don't mean they should be able to do the research. But they need to understand it at some basic level.
Was worth a chuckle.
Code found [here](https://github.com/WillPhillipsCVdemo/Doctor-Strange/blob/master/Dr_Strange.py)
...by_css_selector('a[title="Register"]') achieves the same.
doesnt he want to share resources between c++ and python?
Thank you for your response. At this time I‚Äôm considering the career opportunities, the old pros and cons. Data Science is honestly the right dose of mind challenge for me, as well as cyber security, being the right dose of adrenaline with every security vulnerability found. Could you please provide a roadmap through those tools and knowledges for data science you mentioned earlier? I mean, for instance, I know calculus, algebra, and algorithms are needed, but how far should I pursue them each?
Thank you for your complete response to this question friend. It cleared the path through each field beautifully. I just have one more question I guess I need to ask you. Are online courses sufficient for learning the stuff that is actually required out there? There are usually a lot of tips and points presented in a video course, say ‚ÄúCompleye Python Developer Course‚Äù, but is that really complete? Do you suggest books in return? And could you please name the book/course out if you might? Thanks again for putting the time and answering.
Thanks for your response. Isnit possible to share any information about the tools/knowledges required for each field? I‚Äôm having the phobia I might be without the required skill set when applying for a job.
Thank you for your response. QA also seems interesting, but where exactly is it used? Somewhere like hardware testing? Or is it related to a website‚Äôs security or even a software?
Make a LinkedIn. The jobs tell you what skillset they are after. So search Data Analyst, Business Analyst. Search Python Web Developer. Search Pentester. You will see. I can point you in the direction, but now it's up to you to put the work in. You can be anything you want if you put the work in. I'll be rooting for you. 
I recommend the bloody enterprise
FWIW, I didn't down vote you. My point was to answer your question. &gt; What can the problem be? The problem is that you've got a `break/return` condition that is probably not met within a reasonable amount of time due to the method you're using. Since that's all you asked, that's all I provided. How would you do this if it were marbles and you were putting them into buckets?

Duplicate... you mean completely identical pictures or pictures on which something is identical, but the images themselves are of different size and quality? If first - hash, if second - opencv, ffmpeg and computer vision:)
I wonder if this would be clearer (ironically if you used a bit more wonky magical syntax, maybe like so. &amp;#x200B; from pampy.values import x from pampy.types import List, Int input = \[1, 2, 3\] result = match(input)( List\[Int\[x &gt;= 3\]\] =&gt; x, List\[Int\[x &lt; 3\]\] =&gt; x + 3, )

I don't want to be accused of being a shill but have you heard of our lord and savior Julia? It's supposed to look like matlab but run as fast as c++ and avoids the rewriting problem.
&gt;for strictly identical images, you can simply hash them. Hash functions usually are cryptographic, so changing only one bit in the message usually changes 1/2 of bits of the hash. It only works if it really are the same image. He/she need fingerprinting algorithms (or local sensitive hashing functions) and a distance function. It's explained \[here\]([https://realpython.com/fingerprinting-images-for-near-duplicate-detection/](https://realpython.com/fingerprinting-images-for-near-duplicate-detection/)) or \[here\]([http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/432-Looks-Like-It.html](http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/432-Looks-Like-It.html)). But this is only half part of the problem: check each hash over a large collection of hashes to detect duplicates it's crazy O(n). So is needed a family of data-structured called metric-trees to get results faster. They are explained \[here\]([https://daniel-j-h.github.io/post/nearest-neighbors-in-metric-spaces/](https://daniel-j-h.github.io/post/nearest-neighbors-in-metric-spaces/)). &amp;#x200B; DISCLAIMER: I take the first random links usable to explain the solution. There are a lot of local sensitive hashing functions, distance functions and metric-trees families. I don't use this with images, either know which is the datasets. I've not investigated other problems like transformations (hmirror, cropping, add frames to images, ...) that can be used to avoid duplication detection. But if its for Scrapy its very problable that its not needed. Excuse me my poor english.
Awesome. But snake case AND camel case??

I understand what you are saying, and it is completely fine:) but do you have a solution with Code example? 
I'd be very interested in seeing the code for this! I get report requests pretty frequently myself and I never considered reading my email via Office365.
I just did some testing for this and for N=60 (I arbitrarily picked the middle of the 10-100 range) I find looking up one of the first 10 items (which should give the `list` the best possible chance) to be 3x slower in the `list` than the `dict` with integer keys. [Here's a gist of the benchmark](https://gist.github.com/tynor/e72ed72791e3f6469e5e3ae78484ff17). Maybe I made a mistake?
So you have wrapped twilio's api? For anyone wamdering, you will need paid twilio account for this to work.
Asking this from a background of only being familiar nodejs-style async and not python, if that context is useful - what's the use-case behind having multiple event loops?
Yeah what lol this is a good way to inflate your phone bill twilio charges out the ass for each text
Alright, but /_/_slots_/_ are always going to be unmodified collections of unicode. So what mechanism causes that lookup to be faster than a dict lookup when its already a very favorable case for dict lookup?
You can have a Twilio trial account I was wondering how I could do it for free 
Still don't understand what Asyncio is used for.
Sorry, I probably should have left out the hash table/array fact since it's confusing. It applies primarily to compiled languages like C, C++, Java, etc. where arrays and equality comparison are very fast. Python for loops are very slow which makes iterating over lists slow too.
When I needed python to send SMS to my phone I used the email-to-SMS gateway for my phone service, e.g. for AT&amp;T it's the 10-digit_phone_number@txt.att.net or @mms.att.net, other providers have a similar gateway. This didn't require any 3rd party services and since it was basic email it was easy to use [smtplib](https://docs.python.org/2/library/smtplib.html)
Looking into this 
I don't have the time to go re-read everything right now, but I can tell you that when `__slots__` is specified, the slot descriptors end up in a pre-sorted tuple, not a list.
See my reply to the other person; `__slots__` doesn't use a list. It uses a sorted tuple.
you and 95% of the community both ü§£
What would you use in place of Asyncio? We find it invaluable for writing modern Python applications at work.
I find that people learn in different ways. It's up to you to decide what will benefit you most. I personally never read a python book after my BSc degree. During that time my first touch with python was writing a compiler for c-like language for the PIC18 chip. As soon as I started tokenizing and building parse trees, I understood why my teacher chose python (hint: string handling). There were a lot of problems to be solved and googling, trying things out, knowing other languages, all that helped, but in the end I just solved a problem that is part of a small subset of things that can be done with this tool. My advice is actually to learn by doing. Find a cool repo online of an open source project that interests you and spend some time reading the code. There are bound to be issues and you can try fixing something. Lately I personally have started looking at [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) and [Airflow](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow) because I use them and I find issues or features I'd like to have, so I try to build them. Also, from my experience with working with data scientists, they are great at math, statistics, etc... but a lot of them would have benefited from reading some code before starting to write models.
Concurrency
Looks like you are using ansible? We need to know the tools you have to really be able to help. As noted, python requests can follow redirects, and "curl - L &lt;domain&gt;" also follows.

T-mobile is similar [10-digit\_phone\_number@tmomail.net](mailto:10-digit@tmomail.net). I don't see that they have a separate address for MMS.
You have a good point, but the devil is in the details. You can describe a system with many different data structures, all formally correct for the specific domain of the function, the class, or the library... And yet, there might be a reason way downhill that implementation, which requires an view of the whole problem that she/he is not expected to have. If we can leverage on our own expertise of the problem to propose what we think is the most effective in all scenarios we will apply the program, we should do it. Which is the whole purpose of this thread. When I posted it, I wasn't sure that was possible, but it seems that at least both of them are equally plausible.
So in and of itself having a user definable amount of event loops is useful in some applications-- it would allow the user to have context-switching-like concurrency within actual concurrency. So for the case of JS, async functions are backed by promises, which go to an internal singular microtask queue (think python event loop. If you're wondering "wait the naming doesn't make sense", buddy, a lot of it doesn't. Go from JS to Ruby to Python to C# and you'll hear all kinds of names, but the bad part, in one language X means Y in another language. For example, JS Promises are C# Task Completion Sources, C# Tasks are like Deferreds, but also not like Python Tasks. Python Futures are like deferreds. Sounds confusing? It is. Whose fault? No one, but the asyncio devs were being *extra* confusing about it for no reason so I blame them). But in Python, you can have multiple event loops-- which makes it so that any two sets of functions, which are asynchronous amongst themselves, can be made asynchronous amongst each other. It is a rare niche case, but nice to have. What *isn't* nice to have is that unlike C#/JS/Ruby there is no default event loop (microtask queue). And furthermore event loops aren't spawned in a separate thread (no JS comparison here, because the JS *real* event loop handles this, and there's no good way of making an analogy). So whereas in any normal language like C# / JS you execute whatever asynchronous functions you want and those as a whole would be asynchronous from any actual synchronous code, in Python, you have to do a super complicated setup. There's also an unnecessary rift between coroutines and Python Tasks because of the way the API was designed. Which was a horrible decision. I'm in the process of making a thin wrapper which solves these problems, but actual work is in the way.
For instance, using [ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html).
Check out https://github.com/ltworf/typedload It's specifically for typed classes and uses the types specified on the class to validate the data. To do json you can go string -json-&gt; dict then use dict -typedload-&gt; (lists of)? dataclasses, namedtuples etc.
You are correct: CVS is good for most of the requirements we've identified in the analysis, but not for a bunch of graphs, that require some kind of nested data structure. Also, this code is expected to do pre-processing on the fly for the computationally expensive part, so I would prefer not to write anything to disk.
Thanks, excellent advice. I'm starting adding types in the documentation to describe functions APIs and return types (and before anyone says it at loud: no, Python3 here, yet)
Thanks a lot! I'm reading the links and it seems we don't have to worry too much and keep way more flexibility in the coding.
You can talk to C with things like ctypes. You can also mix your python and C to almost any degree you want using Cython. It's kind of magical.
1,2) we're on it! 3) that is an excellent point, I need to keep in mind pointers 4) I didn't think about exceptions, good call 
Hey. Not to be rude but...what part of this is/requires AI?
I recently made a quick thing with tkinter and was looking for something better for my next thing. Saw this post and replaced the first one with PySimpleGUI, and it looks better both in (code) and out (GUI). This is perfect for second one that I'm about to start, so thanks and well done!
FWIW, I reran the benchmark with tuples instead of lists. Same results, tuple is 3-4x slower than dict, even when fetching values that do not require scanning past the first 10 values.
so it's doing a binary search for the attribute?
I like Celery for having some async processes in not fully async projects.
This is the interface that that python uses for modules written in C/C++. https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html#extending-python-with-c-or-c You can use any C shared object from python with modules like dl, ctypes, cffi.
Machine learning.
Also thanks for replying, you weren‚Äôt rude.
Neat, once in a while it's good to see article like this so one can see ways to improve their code. I really welcome the addition of asyncio.run() that will be very handy to test async code from the interpreter. I wish though they would improve asyncio.subprocess code, it seems like it needs a bit of polish to be on par with regular subprocess.
I would guess -- not having looked at the source -- that your issue is mostly in using the high-level Python interface of these data structures, rather than the low-level/internal things the CPython interpreter gets to do. It's possible that there are things going on there that you can never ever replicate in high-level Python.
Well, take for example the marbles. If I have 6 buckets that I want to randomly distribute them into, do I try to separate the marbles first? I personally would use a 6 sided dice. Each bucket gets a number and so each marble is distributed randomly by rolling the dice and placing it in the bucket assigned to that number. Doing this with code is fairly straight forward: from random import randint def distribute(marbles, buckets): """number of marbles, number of buckets randomly distribute amongst """ counts = {bucket: 0 for bucket in range(buckets)} while marbles &gt; 0: # roll the dice choice = randint(0, buckets - 1) counts[choice] += 1 marbles -= 1 return counts Strictly speaking, this will work with any number of buckets or marbles. So it's better than dice! In [41]: %%timeit ...: distribute(26197, 9) ...: 64.4 ms ¬± 1.18 ms per loop (mean ¬± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each) In [42]: %%timeit ...: distribute(5000000, 9) ...: 12.4 s ¬± 60.3 ms per loop (mean ¬± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each) Little slow on large numbers. I can think of at least one easy way to speed it up though. def distribute_faster(marbles, buckets): """number of marbles, number of buckets randomly distribute amongst """ counts = {bucket: 0 for bucket in range(buckets)} while marbles &gt; 0: adjust = marbles &gt; 5000 # totally arbitrary change = 1 if adjust: change = 5 choice = randint(0, buckets - 1) counts[choice] += change marbles -= change return counts Which is..... In [47]: %%timeit ...: distribute_faster(5000000, 9) ...: 2.68 s ¬± 74.2 ms per loop (mean ¬± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each) Faster! Yes. By slightly less than a factor of 5, which is just about exactly what you would expect. Pretty fun.
I don't understand about 40% of this post, but look at Flask.

OP is looking for a node extinction for python which has a community for new programmers and works well and wants to stay with vscode. How's that!? ^/s
Easier said than done
The asyncio is actually very low level, and it feels like it was not meant to be used directly, but more to build frameworks that utilize it. Having multiple event loops for example allows one to implement multiple threads each having its own loop (default setup) you also could even have multiple loops in a single thread perhaps it doesn't make sense, but I believe they did want to be as flexible as possible. Exposing event loop also made fairly easy to provide alternative of an event loop. For example uvloop provides much faster implementation and it is a drop in replacement.
I think he either wants flask or asyncio. But yeah 80% nonsensical. 
In Python asyncio, a Task is like a thread. It has its own call stack, it can be interrupted (at certain points), and swapped out for another one. Many times, you'll have a good reason for that task to be in existence, like that task's job is to handle a particular user session. So, just like thread local storage, a context variable is a place to store that state so that you don't have to pass it as parameters through its call stack. The most common use case is so you can see the information for the session associated with that task.

What rift is there between coroutines and Tasks? You await on them both. The only difference is that a task wraps a coroutine so it can be free-running.
Thanks, didnt know that sub existed! Ill attempt a cross post if i can figure out how to from mobile. 
For Project Euler, you don't need to know much in terms of software engineering. Basic variables, loops, conditionals and very simple data structures (like lists) will definitely solve most of the easiest third or so.
I believe that's because asyncio is low level, so you need to understand it well to be able to utilize it. It is great for writing concurrent programs for tasks that are I/O bound. IMO for most people it's probably best to use frameworks and other libraries that utilize it. For example you can use aiohttp as a http client/server. aiopg, asyncpg, aiodocker, aiobotocore. There are also many frameworks that support asyncio, for example hug, flask, sanic etc.
There are multiple ways, and they belong into three groups: - traditional c code: https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/index.html - c code generated through tooling: cython, swig etc. - calling functions from python: ctypes, cffi This article summarizes these methods and lists pros and cons: https://www.paypal-engineering.com/2016/09/22/python-by-the-c-side/ Quickly looking at [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow) it looks like they went with the first option.
I'm well aware of Julia (one of the co-workers is a big fan and keeps us up to date with its development), and it has the potential to solve many of our problems. Beside the advantages you mentioned here, it has a syntax pleasantly similar to Python. Sadly, the problem I have with it is betting on a relatively young and evolving language instead of C++. The writing of the vast majority of our program will likely be done once, then extended and improved in the future. Julia seems to be still too young for such an investment on our end. One of the goals is also to make it usable from Python, and while I know this is possible in different ways with Julia as well, we can't risk to tie ourselves to it. This, and the fact we need to extract as much performance as possible from the code (with OpenCL, as I mentioned), makes this choice unlikely. &amp;#x200B;
I'd like to make a suggestion. In your usage you have *termtext --media &lt;image&gt;* But in your options you have *-mms send a picture message* The code looks like it is looking for "--media" so it would make sense to make the options menu match. I'm sure it's clear enough to figure out, which is why it's only a suggestion but I thought I would share my thought.

Hey /u/Diabeetusman I've begun taking your notes (please check out my /slow/ progress) but I sometimes have issues with 15. 15. for i in range(len(someiterable)): is generally frowned upon as being non-Pythonic, especially if you then access items (someiterable[i]). I've heard this so many times and I want to completely appreciate in practice. however I can't figure the nomenclature for interacting with multiple list elements within a loop. In this case, I need to interact with 3 list elements; reading one and potentially rewriting the previous and next. Can I tap you for more wisdom re;this?
This is my typical database interaction... https://gitlab.com/scul/market-watch/blob/master/src/common/database.py import pymongo import os __author__ = 'scul@gitlab.com' __copyright__ = "Copyright 2018, scul@gitlab.com" __license__ = "GPLv3 or later" class Database: URI = os.environ['MONGODB_URI'] DATABASE = None @staticmethod def initialize(): client = pymongo.MongoClient(Database.URI) Database.DATABASE = client[Database.URI.split('/')[-1]] @staticmethod def insert(collection, data): Database.DATABASE[collection].insert(data) @staticmethod def find(collection, query): return Database.DATABASE[collection].find(query) @staticmethod def find_one(collection, query): return Database.DATABASE[collection].find_one(query) @staticmethod def update(collection, query, data): Database.DATABASE[collection].update(query, data, upsert=True) @staticmethod def remove(collection, query): return Database.DATABASE[collection].remove(query) 
Here's an example. User fills out a form on a website and clicks next. You don't want to process the request to email the form info and then load the next page. You want to asynchronously send the email and load the next page instantly.

No problem ! Cool portfolio btw !
The original post appears to be removed and I don't remember the code exactly so I can't check out what you're referencing, but `enumerate` is generally the suggested solution if you _do_ need both the index as well as the value. It would be used something like In [1]: some_list = list(range(21)) In [2]: for loc, val in enumerate(some_list): : if val &gt; 10: : some_list[loc-1] = 10 : some_list[loc+1] = 10 In [3]: some_list Out[3]: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 10, 13, 10, 15, 10, 17, 10, 19, 10] But again, be careful of changing something as you iterate over it. It might be better to note in a second list the indexes that you need to change (using `enumerate` to get both the location and value) and then going back through that second list, using it to access the first, and update values. It can get really easy to accidentally step on your own toes and use the updated value of something when you should have used the pre-updated value.
This is a good way to eul the gears of learning. 
[https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/locating-elements.html](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/locating-elements.html) I refer this when locating particular elements from source code. ctrl+shift+c and open Firefox developer tool and I just navigate through the source code and select and copy the css\_selector or xpath or find the id and paste it inside find\_elements method.

I personally didn‚Äôt love Euler for getting into programming. A lot of the problems are contrived and theoretical. I found I didn‚Äôt really latch on to the learning until I found a solid personal project to work on that kept me wanting to learn more. Are there any simple problems you can think of that a computer could help you solve? I‚Äôd check out the book ‚ÄúAutomate the boring stuff with Python‚Äù. Just give it a skim and see if any of the problems in there are interesting. They have more tangible results in the end in that your applications _do_ practical things. Just my two cents!

Yeah but what about if you're using performance enhancing features like AVX or SSE x.x ? Some CPUs have AVX512 (bad example), some don't... There are many great extensions that not all CPUs support. If I compile expecting support for x and you don't have it then you complain my software is broken. If I don't compile with feature x and you do have it then you complain my code is slow or unoptimised. I could theoretically make massively complex libraries with multiple code paths and so on but it's a nightmare when I could just let the damn compiler do it all for me. So what do I do? I document the compiler options, choose a sane base for CPUs from gen 1 i7 era as my base and then document what compiler flags you can and can't toggle to optimise for your system. Hell if I make the effort I can have the qmake/cmake/make file do some simple logic and thus make some optimisations for me so you get a fairly optimised build without even having to change options yourself. Also, distributing unsigned binaries is potentially a massive security hole. Look at the great extents Linux package managers go to, to ensure that the binary you is installed hasn't been tampered with. There is always a weak link somewhere, but they go to great lengths to reduce the number and strengthen the ones that do exist. Let's say I have own a mirror that mirrors many wheel files and I insert a little malicious code in them. Since they're unsigned you'd never know I've tampered with the original authors' work. If you compile locally you could in fact pull from git and compare or inspect the code yourself. 
I interpreted it as if they want to convert a python prototype to c++ and opencl. Not the same use case.
Are you talking about deep IDE integration like what Pycharm does in addition to how mypy normally operates? 
Which is generally really easy to do. Just send an sms to your favourite email address, and the sender is the email address of the phone. 
&gt; For the same reason, we're avoiding loading external modules and libraries, including Numpy, and use standard lists as arrays (poor performance in Python, but more easy to explain and convert). That's a mistake. A PyList is nothing like a C-array whereas a NumPy array is basically a wrapper around a C-array. You call `PyArray_DATA(my_array_pointer)` and you have a C-pointer. As long as your NumPy array has the flags `ALIGNED` and `CONTIGUOUS` you're fine to just run over it in a C `for` loop. What you want to do is write all your ancillary stuff in Python, and then have a C-extension for the bits that do the computation. The basic pattern going from Python to C via NumPy arrays is quite simple: 1.) Parse arguments and verify they're the correct types. 2.) Use the NumPy PyArray_??? macros to collect whatever information you need. Data type, dimensions, the actual pointer, etc. 3.) Drop the GIL with `Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS` 4.) Call your pure C function. 5.) Reacquire the GIL with `Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS`. 6.) Finalize any Python things you need to return the data for visualization. Then package your return tuple and send it back out of C-land. You don't ever need to eliminate the Python code, you just need to replace the slow parts. That's what makes Python a super useful language for gluing things together. Like, you don't ever want to download molecules from the Protein Databank in C, that would be awful. Similarly you want to use PyMol or Chimera or whatever for visualization. See the docs: https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/index.html https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/c-api.html It's really not that hard to learn the C-API.
1. Yup, you could just call the ping command via subprocess. 2. About the spreadsheet, the easiest way to read it is to put it in Google sheets and open it using the gspread library. 3. About mailing, python has a SMTP library (smtplib) that you can use to send the data you've gathered

Kerbal Space Program is awesome and I think there's a mod called kRPC that lets you control your craft and read flight data with python. Not exactly the genres you listed, but it's still tons of fun to play with. And I think Minecraft Pi has a python interface. 
&gt; Yup, you could just call the ping command via subprocess, although I am pretty sure that there is a lib for that, I just don't know it (google python ping library or something like that) It is possible to ping with scapy, but learning scapy would probably take more time than wrap ping in subprocess calls
I keep all my python scripts single threaded and I either serve them as webapps behind gunicorn workers or I just launch them simultaneously as their own processes under supervisord

create a script to run on a machine that's always on. create a excel file as per your example containing all the ip addresses and user details. read the list using openpyxl. iterate the ip addresses and ping each using subprocess, or use https://github.com/romana/multi-ping/blob/master/README.md. write an excel file using openpyxl send it using smtplib. wrap your entire script in a sensible schedule using https://schedule.readthedocs.io/en/stable/. run your script, profit.

frankly, ping makes sense for finding out if a single host is alive a slightly better (and probably slightly faster) approach would be to scan the whole network range with nmap, then parse its output in python, export the spreadsheet into csv (just because it's a technically simpler text format), then do an intersection of output coming from nmap with the data from csv to find the alive hosts, then email them
thank you. ill work it out üòÉ
i thought so but we have lot of servers and network cameras indie same network range. Thats why trying this
And then if you want some genetic codes - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene
you'll need to look up just the user hosts anyway when you'll do the intersection, I don't think sending one packet to each IP address from the whole range would be such a big overhead, but YMMV sure you can just collect the needed IP addresses of hosts then pass them explicitly to nmap, my point was about the preference of nmap over ping, since this way you won't need to spawn a new ping subprocess for each host
Do you need also palaeontological data?
im stuck at the email part how to send email to each users email address from excel 
Oh man I‚Äôm gonna reinstall KSP now 
1. Export the excel file as CSV and use the [csv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) module to parse the output into your emails. Alternatively, if you don't want to export the file, you can use something like [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html#excel) to read the file directly. 2. Using that data, use [smtplib](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/code-snippets-source-code/using-python-to-send-email) to send the user a message. 
ill try it 
lol. cli.
Using ARP instead of ICMP is also nice for a scan of the local subnet
If you just need to figure out if they're online an ARP scan would probably be faster.
So it's a newer fancier multiprocessing/threading?
Look into numpy/matplotlib/the whole scipy Stack. Otherwise project euler is way less fun 
Do you *have* to do this in Python? Plenty of system monitoring utilities would probably have this baked in.
For 300 requests once a night during off hours there's basically no overhead.
i can do it ... for money 
It's not quite modding but Starcraft 2 has a pretty neat replay feature for which Blizzard released a python API to extract information. See here: https://github.com/Blizzard/s2protocol Also Starcraft 2 is supposed to be the next big game which Google's deepmind will attempt to "solve", and there has been a Python API developed in order to communicate with deepmind. See here: https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2
Basically, it is fixed upstream on the code resolver but it hasn't been pushed to vscode yet, apparently because of release cycles. You have to wait until they update, or build vscode from source yourself.
Are ARP tables as useful since they take time to expire? And would you be able to get results from different subnets that way?
Thanks very much appreciate that. I can look into this. I guess the documentation will have some examples? 
I‚Äôm using flask and jinja templates. So I think I can add in the url2 or requests functionality before the load and push down the redirected url not the original url. Guess I need to do some reading. 
Arp-scan is different from reading ARP tables so it only captures live devices. Although it might not find outside it's subnet, I'd have to check. 
thanks buddyüôÇ. I believe this will help me learn more in python. 
im using Pandora fms didnt found these functions. you can set alerts to admins how can you send alerts to each users seperate email address with nagios or any other systems
Hmmm, I'd argue that OP should avoid the NumPy/SciPy scientific stack for Project Euler. There is little in those libraries that will be of immediate use. The functions that are generally helpful for some of the earlier Project Euler problems (factorial, GCD, LCM, totient, etc.) are either already in Python's standard library, or an excellent opportunity to implement your own version as practice.
I have to look at my code again but IIRC I used it a lot (without just using functions that are already done)
thanks a lotüòÉ
Hi Mahesh. That's the right approach to learn something. scratch that itch. There are lots of free tools to monitor systems. Zabbix is pretty sweet as it has discoverability. Some things to think about. Do you currently have an asset/machine data base. Reading in the owners from this would be a good exercise later on. maintaining multiple lists of assets and contacts is hell. Using nmap is deffo more efficient but check with the network guys that your not going to set off any other alarms. Most nids systems will alarm for port or ping sweeps. However learning how to parrellise a ping sweeps will really help you be more efficient later on. Welcome to python. 
I'm sure Python can pull this off, but it would be really easy with PowerShell.
Only if they are all in the same broadcast domain
thank you for you support...
Nmap will be much faster, 300x 3sec vs 10 sec max. Fping would also do the trick, simpler too. But speed of operations is secondary to getting something shipped. BE can be fast 
Can you do any of these calculations in parallel, 2 loops? Do you know what is limiting your performance? Is it CPU or memory? If it is memory look into using generator functions
The email part is covered in the book ‚Äúautomate the boring stuff with python‚Äù you should look into it. 
This is sending an ARP request though - not using the cached ARP table... The only authority to reply to these requests is the host at that address. A reply 100% grantees a claim on that address. 
ARP is still more reliable (firewalls, configuration) and faster for host discovery on a local network. The admin argument is valid, however.
I hope i'm not too late, but you can ping the broadcast IP to get responses from all the devices at once. The broadcast IP is the highest IP of the subnet. (Per your example the broadcast IP is 192.168.1.255 if the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0)
Pinging 255.255.255.255 will get the response of all devices in your network. Pinging the highest IP in the subnet will get a response from all devices in that subnet. (so pinging 192.168.1.255 will get a response of all 192.168.1.X devices) One caveat is that some devices don't respond to broadcast pings, so YMMV.
yeah im check windows blocking this.
I use arp-scan regularly, yes it cannot find hosts outside it's subnet, but subnet can be changed locally so arp-scan is worth looking into as a option.
I second this. Pandas has made my life sooooo much easier and it's so simple to import all kinds of files with minimal effort
Nope, Wikipedia is no good for your problem, because it lacks the majority of known taxa. Nobody has bothered writing a page for every obscure unicellular thingy. [NCBI Taxonomy DB](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy) is the way to go. Their database is pretty huge, but manageable, AFAIK about a gigabyte. But it's as universal as it gets, with everything from bacteria to human. The way biology works, there is always some disagreement about who belongs exactly where on the Tree of life, but NCBI taxonomy is mostly respected. You may want to check specific databases for some groups, eg algaebase for unicellular photosynthetics, but you'll have a lot of fun reconciling their taxonomies.
You can read excel and csv using pandas.

Guys how to compare these ip's with the excel file and get email address corresponding to those ip's and send mail? `#!/bin/bash` `afinderlog="$HOME"/Documents/active/activelog.txt` `date &gt; "$activelog"` `while IFS= read -r ip; do` `if ping -q -c2 "$ip" &amp;&gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1; then` `echo "$ip" &gt;&gt; "$activelog"` `else` `echo "ip is down"` `fi` `done &lt;"$HOME"/Documents/Alive/iplist.txt`
I third this also pandas is the way forward
strictly static ip's only üòä
Im Reading a very math focused line at school, and Will be doing this as a school work to tie together math and programming in progrem solving. That book sounds very interesting after im done with this though, will definitely check it out!
If you are trying to find computers that should be powered off and they are not, there are better ways: 1. you could check for network traffic from that computer at switch level and alert the owner from a monitoring system. 2. you could have an agent installed on the machine that reports being up if you don't control the switches. 3. you could send remote commands as an admin to shut the machine down if you want it saving power instead. In general, in any company, if they afford to pay you to waste time on this, they can afford the electricity as well. If it's your own project, think about the electricity costs vs your salary for the time you spend and figure out better ways to use your time.
Why is that? 
Elsewhere you mention 300 users. To me that spells subnetting. ARP is great over a LAN, but won‚Äôt pass through a router (ARP uses broadcasts; routers block broadcasts). With 300 users, I‚Äôm also guessing there is some kind of domain. Within domains ICMP is usually reliable. And it can pass routers. 1) I‚Äôd suggest (a) wrapping a command line ping, (b) scapy or (c) python-nmap library for host detection. Nmap is most thorough, but also noisiest and may trigger IDS/firewall alerts so have clear written permission for this; command wrapping is least reliable, but probably simplest. 2) openpyxl - for scraping Excel, linking IP to email. 3) smtplib for email. Al Sweigart‚Äôs book goes through a lot of this. Extremely worth buying and legally available for free [here (see chap 12 and 16).](https://automatetheboringstuff.com) 
im reading thats book. did you checked my last command I created a bash script generates a txt file with alive ip's can you tell me how to compare txt files with excel and get the users email address
we have hot lot servers dhcp wont be a good choice of use in this environment
I've called nmap from python and parsed the output. Nmap can do heaps of handy stuff like detect operating systems and report on open ports. It can also dump the output to XML which python can easily parse.
Wow! This looks interesting! No polymorphism though?
Yeah, it is possible, in fact this won't be too hard as well, cause its simple programming. You don't need some weird math or anything, all you need is simple step by step instructions. 
yeah I just think it's overkill to use pandas for something like that
You can have the servers be static and everyone else be dhcp. It's not all or nothing.

Hello! I'm a bot! It looks to me like your post might be better suited for r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. That said, I am a bot and it is hard to tell. I highly recommend posting your question there. Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster. Show /r/learnpython the code you have tried and describe where you are stuck. **[Be sure to format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F)** and include which version of python and what OS you are using. *** ^(this bot is written and managed by /u/IAmKindOfCreative) ^(This bot is currently under development and experiencing changes to improve its usefulness)
The simplest way is to export it as a CSV file. Then use a CSV reader. 
Yup, I've done something similar. 1. Can ping using ping directly with os.subprocess or os.cmd. since it is a ping (very basic), don't need to use some fancy ping library. 2. Better to save the xls as CSV, which you can read as a text file using filehandler.readlines(), followed by a line.split('') command to get necessary fields. 3. Python has an email library in it's standard imports. It works well with SMTP servers. Use it. Here is an example - https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/email-examples.html 1,2 and 3 should allow you to do everything you want. Some modifications. If you're hell bent on xls, use pandas or something to read the file. Also, there's a nice library out there called multiping which handles multiple ping requests in a simple way. Enjoy
I disagree. Once you have pandas, it takes one very simple line to import it. Your proposal already implies to open excel and export to csv which is actually a long process.
Thank you for your replay. One more question... cython lets me write Python code which is transpiled to C code ?
Created a bash script which generate a txt file with list of alive ip's. can u tell me how to compare these ip's with the excel file and get email address corresponding to those ip's and send mail?
Thank you for giving me 'pointers' xd :)
I think I got a quite good 'pointers' where to start, from all of you. Thank you.
This. My recommendation in most cases would be that servers, network devices (routers, switches, access points etc.) and any network monitoring devices should have static IPs. Anything that isn't on 24/7 should use DHCP, with an address reservation for devices that are directly accessed by other devices (printers would be a good example).
The only disadvantage is pandas needs to be installed. But once it's there there's no reason not to do it.
Not really, other than using computers and python, cryptography is a completely different thing. Bitcoin, etc. are hot now, but they doomed in the long term by Quantum computers https://duckduckgo.com/?q=will+quantum+computers+solve+bitcoin+algorithm Everything that you write on the internet today that you think is private and anonymous, will be decoded by quantum computers in a few years.
This thread feels like an xy problem https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem
It has never been a long process for me. Beyond that there really isnt a good reason to keep this data in Excel. Pandas, as nice as it might be, just adds a dependency that isn‚Äôt needed. Further more you are increasing the complexity of what should be a real simple app. Then there is the issue of somebody that asks this question really needs to learn Python! That includes the standard library. We have all been beginners and frankly I‚Äôm not far from being such myself but when I see questions like this bells go off indicating that a person really needs to put in more time learning the basics of Python. There are many responses to his question that in my opinion undermine the learning process. Sometimes looking for the best library to plug into the problem, scuttles any possibility of a deeper understanding of Python itself. 
The problem with this is that a computer will respond to ping if it is powered on without a user logged in. Unless these are laptops which are always brought home with the user Honestly though, the better way to address this would be with a powershell script. You can check to see if a user is logged in and then send an email. 
I tend to agree with what you said but : &gt; Beyond that there really isnt a good reason to keep this data in Excel. There is one ~~good~~ big reason why I'm used to switch between excel and pandas : I work for a big old company... :')
Good bot. 
Good bot. 
Also there is static dhcp.

Not really "new"-- the idea behind it is context switching, which libraries like gevent give via "green threads".
Threading would be a better analogy. Since you still have the GIL, only one task can execute at a time. You will not get something akin to multiprocessing with vanilla coroutines (coros). With OS threads, the OS determines when to switch between threads. This could happen at any line of code in the thread. With python coroutines, each coroutine will run until it hits *await* and then yield back to the event loop. Whenever a particular coroutine is executed again by the event loop, it will pick up at the *await* it previously left off at. This allows you to clearly define where (but not when, as the event loop can pick back up on any waiting coro) context switching happens. Note that coroutines are NOT a replacement for threads, as threads can outperform coros in some cases. Rather, its about what the program calls for. I wrote a server awhile back, and used coros for the socket handling. Once the data gets read off the socket though, a separate process with a thread pool (so not bound to the GIL the coros are using) actually handles the data and does the work. 
&gt;1. Yup, you could just call the ping command via subprocess, although I am pretty sure that there is a lib for that, I just don't know it (google python ping library or something like that) `ping` use ICMP, which you can't use without elevated permissions, so you are actually required to call out to the system's `ping` binary unless you're running as root.
You could install nagios...
I agree. It seems much simpler to export to a csv than to try to use outside dependencies.

If this is a real program for a real company, you should check with the compliance department if this is allowed. I'm quite certain that you need to have an opt-in system in place under the GDPR. In the US it is less strict, but better to check. If it's just a test program, then no worries.

A tip: Don't name your Resume file: resume. Name it something less generic, preferably including your name.
I just bought OReilly‚Äôs Python book and it‚Äôs really good with examples and repetition. I also subscribed to projecteulor and ended up buying a discrete mathematics books since I don‚Äôt remember anything from college or even high school days. If you‚Äôre planning on applying for one of the big tech companies then google Leetcode. Those are the types of examples they ask you during the interviews. But Leetcode is a subscription service so you should use that when you‚Äôve been working on Python for a while.

&gt;About the spreadsheet, the easiest way to read it is to put it in Google sheets and open it using the gspread library. What? No, just use pandas\_read. Why on earth would you advise this?
I'm reticent to answer the question that much. Figuring that out is what makes it learning.
Hello, I created a package called [messages](https://github.com/trp07/messages), also on PyPI: ```pip install messages```. Amongst the features, it wraps the python standard library email module, making creating and sending emails easy. I'd be happy to help if you're interested in trying it out.
Then yeah you shouldn't have any problem being able to do this . Sounds like a really fun project!
üòÉ
To email your own employees? lol
I would export the Excel file as a csv and build a dictionary of IP-&gt;email. Then just loop over your live IP addresses and look up the associated email address to send the message. This should be pretty easy to do without external dependencies. (Like all the modules people have suggested in this thread.) I wouldn't install external dependencies unless it's really hard to do with built in functionality.
I think you are too fixated on using the Excel file directly. A CSV exported from the sheet is **much** easier to work with.
Sometimes it has to stay in excel because other users need to edit the data. 
&gt; nagi https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_gluster_storage/3/html/console_administration_guide/configuring_nagios_to_send_mail_notifications
Do you have an example of where this happens? I use mypy pretty frequently, and I don't think I've ever seen it incorrectly infer "object" as the return type.
Is there a source for that too? I could use it
That's quite the list! My recommendation is to start with an engineering question you can solve rather than vice versa--starting with the coding. Use of matplotlib will be easy, that's just visualisation at the end. Interpolation can probably be used in many of the areas. One thing that comes to mind might be a heat-flow simulation, which would give you a diffEQ solution (Fourier's law). For simple geometries you could solve it analytically, which gives you symbolic solving and solution of differential equations (nice well-behaved linear elliptic PDE). The problem is that I would guess solving a PDE to be a 4th year or grad level thing. Not sure how polynomial zeroes would fit in though. Anyway, just an idea. &amp;#x200B;
Or just convert it to CSV and use the `csv` module built into the standard library.
can you help me in comparison of ip with csv and get the email associated with ip in that csv thats where im stuck
`csv` is built into the standard library, so no dependencies.
Or even save as csv, then csv.reader()
There is some talk about this in stack overflow, but generally the only time I have seen imports done in a method or function it was for one of two reasons. 1. The method is called so very rarely that importing it at the beginning gives worse performance because it is generally never used. This is more an issue for microservices. 2. To hide from a circular import issue. Neither are stellar reasons to do it. Importing in the method will have a smallish impact on the runtime of that method the first time you call it. Honestly I hate seeing it done that way but that's just me.
Yes the easy solution would be Nagios or even some bash/powershell trickery, hell at work once management asked for something like this and a colleague did it with powershell/batch some dark windows dialect. But let's face it, with Python is so much more fun and readable. This is how I would do it. Feel free to update with any suggestions. https://gist.github.com/xr09/96bc267a0112c435007339dabaf699cc
I didn't see anyone mention that ping might be blocked on a firewall level. I saw that recently. I don't know if it's common.

Op could stand to just convert the file to a csv which can be viewed in Excel and is much faster to read.
Bruh, you're advising someone to pull in a massive library like pandas to open a csv in python? C'mon, that is not good advice.
Some arguments: * Importing things can be slow (scipy and numpy come to mind) importing is done when the import statement is run. This can add slowdowns when the programming is running (rather than when it is starting). Sometimes this is desirable - sometimes not. * Importing things later means that missing imports are detected later than they might otherwise be. All things being equal it is good to detect errors earlier. * Sometimes you might not want to rely on having modules install but use them if they are there for a particular feature. (Suppose your tool can import to some nice format). It can be natural to delay the import here, and cleaner than a bunch of ugly try/except code. * Given the above *reasons* for importing later. It can violate the "rule of least surprise" to import late. People might think "why are they importing here - it might be for this reason - but there is no comment". * There are a couple of arguments that people might come up with (personally I think these are post-hoc rubbish arguments use to win arguments). i. It might be confusing to assume that you a module is in global scope in one function and then find it isn't (an awful lot of things are confusing - that is why you use a linter and run your code). It is nicer to see all the imports in one place (meh, there are quite a lot of imports when do you ever read them), some tools might use top level imports (this is a little more compelling since there can be valid reasons to delay imports). * Doing what other people do unless there is a good reason not to results in less surprise and less confusion. I don't know. Programming is hard.... or rather ordering all the junk when coding is hard. My personal bias would be towards top level imports base on a (neatness - keep things in one place - fewer categories are good) saving late imports for when they are required with imports. I would then refactor at the *module* level to reduce the number of imports (or use dependency injection of some description maybe). I think the really compelling argument is "early error detection" and "consistent run-time post startup". I hate complexity... I hate programmers :/ 
I have got this from virtualenv in pycharm.
&gt; 1. The method is called so very rarely that importing it at the beginning gives worse performance because it is generally never used. Also because *you don't want to make the user install this library*. &gt; 2. To hide from a circular import issue. I hadn't thought of / remembered that one. Good point.

I'm not sure I understand the Lassie example in Part 1. If you "inline" `feed_animal` this is what you get: lassie: Dog = Dog() chocolate: Chocolate = Chocolate() lassie.eat(chocolate) which obviously violates the signature of `lassie.eat`. Why should you need contravariance to solve this?
Put "Aspiring web developer" rather than "Amateur web developer". First one sounds way better.

I like how you incorporated other apis it looks cool and seems really useful 
Just because you copied the anaconda environment, doesn't mean you copied along all the other dependencies. It's best to recreate it from scratch with a fresh anaconda install. In the future, you should export a list of the library versions used in your environment and rebuild based off of that list.

There doesn't seem to be anything wrong. When I do a smaller number of tests and count in how many two people have the same birthday it's the same result. So I guess the math in the paradox isn't right although that would be weird. I really can't find another explanation. I just wanted to show this weird result and I'm not trying to learn python. And don't I describe the problem in the header?
Here is a snippet of code from a I use to pull data from a javascript table. Define the website as url = "whatever.com" then from there... 1. Grab javascript generated HTML data using Selenium script 2. Hand off data to Beautiful Soup to parse table information 3. Create Pandas Dataframe in order to do whatever you want with table data def create_custom_data_table(self): url = 'https://whatever_is_the_url/' self.driver.get(url) # Use send_keys to manipulate website url and generate whatever data you want displayed self.driver.find_element_by_xpath('//*[@id="adminkeystable_length"]/label/select').send_keys(Keys.PAGE_DOWN, Keys.ENTER, Keys.ENTER, Keys.TAB, Keys.TAB, Keys.TAB, Keys.TAB) time.sleep(2) # Returns site HTML and hands off to Beautiful soup to process for table data html = self.driver.execute_script("return document.getElementsByTagName('html')[0].innerHTML") soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'lxml') table = soup.find_all('table')[0] df = pd.read_html(str(table))[0] # Pandas dataframe vehicles_list = df['Stock Number'].tolist() associate_list = df['Associate'].tolist()
The problem is that what you want is to check each person against *everyone* in the group. However, your code doesn't do that. It's difficult to tell exactly what it's doing without the indentation being preserved but it's wrong irrespective. From your style, I would guess that you're relatively new to programming. I could be wrong here, so apologies if so. What I would suggest is breaking the program apart in to a few different functions. * Define a function that performs the whole test. * Define a function that creates a random list of birthdays of length L * Define a function that counts computes a histogram of the list. * Define a function that takes the histogram and computes the number of people who share a birthday from it. * Define a function that does the output housekeeping * Write test cases for all of the functions using a unit testing framework. Somewhere in this journey you will identify the precise problem &gt;!(hint: at the histogram step)!&lt; with the code above. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
What kind of calculations are you doing? Is it necessary to do them in a loop? Can you parallelise them using matrix operations? If you cannot parallelise them in a way that numpy should offer huge speed increases then OpenCL will be equally useless. It's important to know that GPUs are exceptionally good at certain classes of calculations but cannot do many other kinds. If you cannot parallelise, i.e. The one value depends on the previous one and they must be done sequentially for all values then OpenCL isn't going to help. If you have multiple datasets then can be operated on independently then you can make use of threading for some parallelization but this isn't a place where OpenCL would help. Show us some of your code or describe your problem better. If you're using loops you're probably doing something fundamentally wrong which OpenCL won't magically solve through use and if the loops are a must then OpenCL probably won't help as that's not what it's good for... 
Yes I considered PyUp but they do not support Bitbucket. I also don‚Äôt need the automated pull requests, as convenient as they are. 
About the smtp lib. Just now I finished working with it and sometimes you have to compromise the security of your mail account by allowing your script(which means any other script can do the same) to send mail from your account. I suggest Gmail Api. I just used it, works like a charm. 
xr09 I tried with linux getting output as jenwasonline at date but still knocker.log is empty 
You said there's something wrong with your result. Either the paradox is wrong or your code is wrong but you haven't described the paradox. So you haven't described the problem. Therefore noone can know what your desired results are because they won't know the issue you're trying to solve. they could look it up, but may find different versions of the description. Plus it's more effort for them when you should be providing the information.
Hey, I know ping is the best option but here's another fun way you could try. 2 scripts. 1-database or to make it even simpler, a file with an associative array(let's call it the state matrix) . Each element corresponds to one PC and a binary variable to Indicate status. I. E. 1=ON 0=off. This file will be on your PC from where our 1st script(the server side script works) Lets talk about the 2 scripts. 1-Server side script: this will monitor the database/state matrix. You can set the script for periodic monitoring if you want. If you're about to leave the office, you fire this script and it goes through the entire matrix to see if there are any 1s(PCs still on) and then you can take action accordingly. 2- client side script: should run when the state of PC is being toggled. The script will change its value in the database/state matrix. Benefits: 1- Nothing really, you'll just have a lot of fun doing this üòÇ I thought of it right now. Cons: 1)client script needs to be installed on each PC. 2) Tiresome if you're not a happy programmer. P. S. Okay this was just an idea which you could have fun with. My advice, look out for the emailing part. I'd suggest Gmail Api rather than going for raw smtp lib. Can causes issues. 
Hilarious we have google spreadsheets and pandas suggested before this old standby :)
nice ideaüòâ
Very useful! Next time i need diamond shaped text this will really come in handy!
Why?
I haven't looked, but if it's open source you could potentially fork it and make the modifications necessary to support bitbucket. 
Well the place this tends to come up is when you have a rarely-used feature. For example, suppose ou are writing a git client, and it can optionally output it's results to graphviz, or plot a graph or something. You might not want to depend on matplotlib for normally functionality (e.g. running on a server - doing useful things). But you might still want the functionality there for the desktop client. I guess there are alternatives. I suppose you could have two libraries built from the same code base with different dependencies couldn't you. I'm not sure that's much better tho!
Done. Thank you!
Pandas is a bit overkill for the task. Op could easily convert it to csv as suggested above
Your explanation sounds very shady and incredible, but it does not matter. What you want to do is impossible no matter if it's Windows or Unix, because only kernel has access to the cache.
Oh man, this my first time hearing about the XY problem, and everything in that wikipedia article is so spot on it hurts.
Potentially, but even then, Pandas makes working with CSV's a million times easier. I get that it's not the smallest library but 9/10 times it's easier than alternative methods
Ok, what is the end goal?
You are right, I'm saying that since no complex data processing is needed, in this case is overkill
I didn't know what you suggested, it's very interesting! I also looked at some of your other posts (here and in your blogs) and I found lots of interesting things. When you have a minute, it would be great if you could write a post about combining Python, C++, and NumPy, specifically, because beside the documentation you suggested, I couldn't find much online, especially simple and clear examples. That said, I'm not sure if this applies to our case (but I could be wrong). We are using Python only for prototyping, and in the end everything will be translated in C++. Hence the effort to avoid loops, idiomatic patterns, etc. Because of that, there should not be no need for using NumPy since we're going to use C-arrays directly. (for sake of completeness: eventually, we'll wrap the C++ code to provide Python bindings, but in this way we will expose the internal data structures, so we could expose NumPy arrays to the Python interpreter...) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;

I use ping to determine if the computer I'm running on has network yet, as it is booted at the same time as the router. This will ping once on Windows and Unix based hosts. import subprocess def ping(host): """ Ping host and return boolean and ping text. :param host: Address or host to ping :return: (boolean for success, ping text) """ # Ping parameters as function of OS if system_name().lower() == 'windows': parameters = '-n 1' else: parameters = '-c 1' ping_process = subprocess.Popen('ping {} {}'.format(parameters, host), stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, shell=True) return_val = ping_process.wait() stdout, _ = ping_process.communicate() output = stdout.decode('UTF-8') # look for failure text on unix and windows. success = return_val == 0 and 'TTL expired' not in output and 'Time to live exceeded' not in output return success, output 
Sometimes it makes sense to import in a function (seen sometimes in config management to defer installation of dependencies for particular functionality) or in an "if __name__ = " to separate CLI dependencies like docopt from core dependencies (if you import it without using cli)
If you already know the emails, you can create a dictionary with certain local IP and and email. Then use nmap with subprocess to get the local hosts on your network.

No. Everything should be dhcp including servers, printers, etc. You can use bootp for things that need to have the same ip, but static ip addressing is just lazy to the point of inefficient laziness. Set everything dhcp, set reservations to devices that need to be referenced by IP address (read none) and done. There's no reason for static ip addresses for any device aside from an edge router and the dhcp server itself.
You would have try: import graphviz except ImportError: some logic 
In your case the problem with `feed_animal` is gone exactly because you did inline the body of the function. Before inlining, you could violate the signature of `feed_animal` because it did have one and it did accept a general `Animal` object. After inlining, there is no signature to make it possible to sneak in a `Chocolate`, it needs to be explicit.
Yep that's an alternative approach. I think the local import reveals intent a bit better (because the import is directly next to use), further the error is a little clearer ("import graphviz failed... I guess I need to install graphviz"). This approach does have some benefits. I suppose the "no import while running" thing might be a benefit. 
Very true. Probably to do with the fact I simply can't deal with the default python CSV library, I find it way too clunky
If you have a lot of io, your applications could still be speeded up with threads or async. Like for example what if you were web scraping or hitting lots of api calls. 
We should use the primitive way of sending sms using the gateways instead of Twilio Twilio is expensive 
I've never used NEAT, but check out TensorboardX https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboardX
Just read the values from the original object. ins = A() ins.x = 3 ins.y = 4 ptr = pointer(ins) func2(param1, ptr) print(ins.x, ins.y) The object that the function will modify and the python object are the same thing. Also, if you don't need to store the pointer to the object, use `byref` instead. It's faster.
If you are new, then start with Anaconda and Spyder, those are beginner friendly. When you get used to it, then you can find and setup IDE that you like.

The user never wants to see something fail, unless this is library code. You'd set something like try: import graphviz plotting_backend = GRAPHVIZ except ImportError: plotting_backend = MATPLOTLIB logger.warn('graphviz not installed, using matplotlib') Then later on you'd check if plotting_backend == GRAPHVIZ So you're intent is actually much clearer
Check out the socket module. You could create a socket and then try to connect to each ip address to see if it's up and then if it's up you could send the email. I would use a dictionary to store the data in the excel file.
Can you post the source code.
yeah im doing everything you are telling. logging creates the file but logging.info not writing to the log file. if possible could you share your email ill pm you
This should go in /r/LearnPython 
im working on xr09's script you can check it out with the below link. https://gist.github.com/xr09/96bc267a0112c435007339dabaf699cc
So the sort of thing I had in mind was some sort of command-line utility that can use some features. Think something like "git". You might, theoretically have a feature like "git log --graphical". I wasn't distinguishing between graphviz and and matplotlib, rather I was saying, that you don't want to *require* matplotlib (or graphviz) for normal operation but want it for a particular feature. &gt; The user never wants to see something fail Hmm.. the user might also not want to unnecessarily install matplotlib and not want to install more than one package, or have to learn about these useful features from a web page rather than having it there in --help. They might also not want warnings all the time about a feature they do not use! You can't always satisfy all the constraints :). A closer example to what I meant would look more like: try: import matplotlib except ImportError: matplotlib = None ... if args.graph: if not matplotlib: raise Exception('need matplotlib for --graph') 
Good point, that's a really cool example
I discovered pyboard and micropython last year, Was hooked right away and completely left arduino. Now I exclusively use esp32 for all my projects. 
This question belongs in /r/learnpython 
Cool thanks for the link!
So is urllib.request but that's not good or should be used.
&gt; Q: How can I use X to do Y? &gt; A: If what you want is to do Y, you should ask that question without pre-supposing the use of a method that may not be appropriate. Questions of this form often indicate a person who is not merely ignorant about X, but confused about what problem Y they are solving and too fixated on the details of their particular situation. Finally I have a word to describe colleagues wanting to use Blockchain or Big Data or Chatbots for no good reason without understanding the technology. 
Where was this yesterday when I needed it?
There's also a Nmap Python module :) 
Why not?
But, inlined or not, surely such a thing wouldn't be possible in a statically typed languag, right? Seems more like a limitation of MyPy than anything else. Heck, I'm pretty sure even PyCharm would flag that line as having the wrong type.
thats way uglier than subprocess 
Quick tip, you should identify the computer using their MAC address instead of IP. 
Correct, you basically write Python code that is compiled as a binary module. Note that Cython is a superset of Python language, meaning you can compile existing Python code with no modification, but if you provide additional information, for example declare static types for primitive variables, you can make your code much faster. Also I did not mention it, there is also Numba which addresses similar area to Cython. Numba is generally simpler to use, you annotate specific functions that you want and it compiles them when the code is run, but you probably get better performance with Cython and even greater when you write a C extension. It essentially is a spectrum, on one end you have easiness and less amount of work to get better performance (Numba) on other end you get better speed at the cost of more work and being exposed to C (writing c extension). Cython is in the middle.
You can use the sys module to run a bash or dos command, thus the ping command and get the output. I have ine script like this but using twilio to send a SMS.
Nevermind. I looked it up. That's a good idea. Perhaps you can expand your CLI to accept the gateway type as an argument.
Another example is the Excel functionality in pandas - it doesn't import xlrd or pyopenxl until you try and read/write an Excel file because 90% of users probably only work with CSVs and they don't want to force the installation of dependencies that aren't necessary
I come from a industrial electronics engineering so I worked with assembler, C, etc. When I discovered Python was like when Aladdin flies with Jasmine in the flying carpet.
Yeah, I searched a bit but I wanted a more expert recommendation than picking the first page in Google. But thanks I will look it up!
Cool video. I like the "live" coding you do for both the server.py and client.py scripts. Great job.
 https://pastebin.com/rbamRJQQ I put this together in about 20 minutes so there is a lot of tweaking that needs to happen, but this is the general idea of how I would go about this. To run this on a schedule use cron or Windows Task Scheduler. If the file is a csv like you have pictured, this should work (you may have to skip the first line): &gt; 192.168.1.1,john,john@company.com &gt; 192.168.1.2,max,max@company.com Beware the ping function I found may have some false positives. If the ping results in Destination unreachable, it may result in the host being up. If you are on Linux, the ping command needs to be ping -c 1. If you are on Windows it needs to be ping -n 1. Or just make the script tell when to use which switch.
Why did you use python 2.x? I think python 3.x is better these days.
Thank you all for your answers!
Excel can open and modify .csv just fine.
thats very informative thanks a lot to spend your valuable time for this. ill check it out üòä
Yeah it is hard to find a project to implement all the required parameters...only a calculator maybe. We haven't done any heat-flow courses yet so I don't have knowledge in this are. We have just started with thermodynamics this semester. Professor was talking we could do some face recognition programs but I don't know how would I use all the stuff above. 
I‚Äôm out of the loop, what‚Äôs the difference between esp8266 and esp32? 
Eve Online
Use pyping and if it returns 0 it's up. I use this to determine if a box is up to continue automated testing or not.
But it can't store information about background colors, cell formats, active filters, and row/column sizes, and other spreadsheet information that most excel users want in a .csv just fine.

Note that for generating glue code, from Python perspective SWIG is considered obsolete. It might be useful if you're author of the C library and want to create bindings for multiple languages one of which is Python. If your objective is just to use a given library in Python then currently CFFI is the best way to do it: https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
Some thoughts: * You should be careful you aren't taken for a ride by people (either on purpose or kind of by mistake by not defining what you want). * Programmers can be a little expensive... * I'd suggest going to your nearest python event and networking in person, I doubt these people will have lots of time on their hands but they might be able to give you some pointers. * Maybe doing some pair programming (possibly paid - or "in exchange for a meal and bear") with someone would be a good way to start. Tell me if I'm wrong, but I get the impression that you don't exactly know what you want or what can be done etc so just hacking some code up with someone their might be a good wy to go. 
Can do the same with powershell. Or even a mail merge in word if you want a UI for the email piece 
That guy is very knowledgeable. He's also very helpful. I believe he's running the beeware project. 
How can I get the lon/lat of given address location?
I'm probably getting too target fixated here, but I just saw the requirements for the file were: -easy to use in Python -can be opened in Excel -data can be edited in Excel. My thought is that this file is going to feed his script and that the editing will be adding or removing users and updating IPs. If the full functionality of Excel is required, then my suggestion would be something like xlsxwriter however, I don't get the sense that this is what OP is trying to accomplish. I absolutely could be wrong. I'm just explaining my reasoning.

What system are you using? If you're on Linux, I'd use a system call to arpscan -l, them you don't have to deal with sockets. Arp is more robust than pinging, as well. The out put of tsv is something which is pretty easy to parse as something like TSV
since it just started up we wanted to write it in python2 then covert it to python3 in later releases
Yep.
The extra modules you mentioned sound like they aren't an easy fit for a new programmer (except for maybe flask). Look into using dash to visualize a range of solutions to simple differential equations. It is a great package for out of the box interactive plots, which would be useful for diff-eq solution visualizations. 
Yes. From PEP8: "Imports are always put at the top of the file, just after any module comments and docstrings, and before module globals and constants." There's generally no reason to import in the middle of the file
r/learnpython
Ironically, a truly horrible website to navigate.
 Indeed Dr. Russell Keith-Magee has 57 taks on PyVideo. Some going back as far as 2009. Are you really recommending that we watch all of them? I went ahead and read all of the talk descriptions. The one that seemed most relevant to Python in the browser, is the BeeWare talk at PyCon US 2018. Indeed I already had it in my catalogue. [https://pythonlinks.info/building-a-cross-platform-native-app-with-beeware](https://pythonlinks.info/building-a-cross-platform-native-app-with-beeware) I make it a point to only have recent talks from the best conferences. If you prefer you can watch it directly on YouTube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?time\_continue=3&amp;v=qaPzlIJ57dk As for NickSil‚Äôs criticism of PythonLinks, it would be much more helpful if he were specific. I thought that people on cell phones liked swiping. So why is that a ‚Äúpain to use‚Äù? What was the specific problem which you encountered? One problem that I think some people have is that they are used to swiping on a grid. They are not used to swiping on a tree. But if you want to organize 822 videos with no more than 7 in each category, then one really needs a tree. Once you realize that you are swiping on a tree, rather than a grid, then it makes more sense. And of course the root of the tree only has 1 item, so you cannot swipe left right or down, just up. That is being fixed. Soon there will be 3 items in the root. And swiping left or right will circle around once you reach the end. Is that the problem which you had? Or was there some other problem. Thanks. 
Since it just started up it should have been done in version 3. Don't doom your projects by writing them in legacy language versions.
&gt;Are you really recommending that we watch all of them? No, of course not. Where did you get the idea I was suggesting to watch *all* of them? &gt;I thought that people on cell phones liked swiping Where'd you get the idea I was using a cell phone to browse your site? I am browsing on a desktop.

How you done this? Followed a tutorial or something?!
I googled for a long time to get the webscrapping down then saw someone made a module for Instagram that allows you to upload, made a bot to scrape images, manually convert them to jpg then run the upload bot
Yes I found it on github like 2 weeks ago, but it was a sketchy script. Keep googling man
 Thanks for the specific comments. Maybe what people have a problem with is the desktop version. Maybe they are okay with the cell phone version. The graphical web on the desktop version is useful for displaying the concept but in practice i use the cell phone version and arrow keys for my daily desktop interactions with the website. The reason that hovering over the web changes the displayed page is to allow you to explore, and see what is available in any branch of the tree. If it did not change the page, you could not explore the site. Plus it shows how fast the site is. Maybe the problem is that by dragging the mouse over the graph, you lost the original page you visited. That would indeed be a problem. Maybe it needs to start with the graphical web locked. Comments hugely appreciated. 
Even worse, someone who develops on Windows. 
Honestly, I think this is a better question for your instructor. There are a lot of potential projects that we could propose, but if you haven't covered the topics in our proposed project, then you're still SOL. But hey, I'll take a stab: something to do with the simulation of a multi-DOF system. You throw in some eigenvalue analysis, visualization, maybe pole placement if you're tuning a controller, and I think it would chack all your boxes.
I see what you are doing there, this would actually be possible. It feels like it would be too much magic to be pythonic :) You can definitely write a wrapper over Pampy to have that syntax work. I encourage you to try ;)
If you like the talk, you can also retweet the announcement. https://twitter.com/PythonLinks/status/1061612277709893634

IMO the whole swiping in 4 direction concept is so different from evertything else out there its very unintuitive. I would much prefer a web page that works exactly like everyone else. One I do not need to learn anything new. Just a single page, with manual scrolling. Put all the links with sub catogary in a left-side menu or something we can just look through and click by ourselves.
you could use non-blocking sockets and select() directly, then have a small thread pool process them in queue-fashion as data becomes available.

Others have covered some of the exceptions, but the general rule is to put everything at the top unless you have a specific reason to do otherwise. 
ESP32 is a successor to the ESP8266 which adds Bluetooth and is available in single and dual core versions, and I believe supports connecting an external antenna too. 
Christ, dude. 
I'd add unittests to that list. Your test can be more granular if you import inside the test itself.
"Don't you guys have cell phones?"
I‚Äôm paying of course 
Almost any of them will work, you'll need to load Micropython on them. Here's the link to the microphython ESP32 page ahttps://github.com/micropython/micropython/tree/master/ports/esp32. The advantage of the more costly (Pycom ESP-32 based) brands is they have Micropython pre-loaded. It's easiest if you start with a real PyBoard (not ESP32 based). There's also the Adafruit Circuit Python, which is a fork of Micropython but they shun things like interrupts in favor of simplicity. For me interrupts are a high priority (excuse the pun) so I stick with micropython.
Sorry 
I assume from your username you are the website owner. You website might have useful content somewhere, but it is a complete dumpster fire. 
There are many places, where people are willing to invest time to help you. However you should ask specific questions like: -My code should do this but it does not work?! -How do you use command X properly in this case? Reddit and stackoverflow are good places for that, but you have to start yourself and not beg for a 100% solution.
Please keep imports at the top. https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports

TL;DR: WebAssembly, but not yet.
&gt; I wanted a more expert recommendation than picking the first page in Google. I have found that it's always best to list up the resources that you already found and what was deficient in them. Then people who reply know what you have already looked at and what more that you are looking for. It's possible that there isn't a definitive answer out there and that if you make it, it will become the top answer on Google and impress your future employer.
PEP-8 says to do all imports at the top. Further to that you should do all built-in imports first then 3rd-party imports and your local application imports last. Personally I don't bother so much with separating built-in from 3rd-party because I don't remember what's actually built-in and what I installed on my system years ago, but I still keep local imports last. Basically, imports always affect the global scope, and messing with the global scope somewhere down in a method or clause **never** makes "more sense" as it will change the scope for every other method &amp; clause regardless of their position in the code. I have in the past done something like "mod = __import__('MyModule')" which should import in the local scope, I would say I was wrong to do so but it might be acceptable in some very very rare circumstances tl;dr: Imports first, then global constant variable definitions, then class/function/etc definitions, then you have your logic usually enclosed in a "if __name__ == '__main__'" but that's entirely up to you.
Circular imports are not an issue, Python's memory allocator is smart enough for that. I don't actually know or understand what kind of magic that uses to work safely, but this worked fine: foo.py import bar def foo(): return 'foo' def foobar(): return bar.bar() bar.py import foo def bar(): return 'bar' def foobar(): return foo.foo() $ python3 &gt;&gt;&gt; import foo &gt;&gt;&gt; foo.foo() 'foo' &gt;&gt;&gt; foo.foobar() 'bar' &gt;&gt;&gt; foo.bar.foo.bar.foobar() 'foo' &gt;&gt;&gt; # And just out of curiosity, let's check the IDs ... id(foo) 139627125511576 &gt;&gt;&gt; id(foo.bar) 139627125511816 &gt;&gt;&gt; id(foo.bar.foo) 139627125511576 &gt;&gt;&gt; id(foo.bar.foo.bar) 139627125511816
I promise you circular imports are an issue. As I am fighting them at work right now because someone before me did some crazy things and used importing in functions to get around it.
I think part of what makes your code slow is that in the case where the constraint is large, you spend a _lot_ of time generating solutions that don't satisfy the constraint (e.g. the numbers all being zero will never satisfy the constraint). I would suggest looking into an approach like this: - The first part of the problem, coming up with sums that add up to the constraint, is called the integer partition problem, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(number_theory), and there are great algorithms to solve it e.g., http://jeromekelleher.net/generating-integer-partitions.html - Your problem is slightly different, in that your integer partitions are limited to those with a fixed number of terms. So consider the partitions of 4 [[1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 2], [4]] If you only had 3 variables (D,E,F) then you can reject [1,1,1,1]. So you could adapt the integer partition algorithm to only return partitions with say less than 6 terms, by starting it out somewhere different. Note that if you had 3 terms, a partition like `[1,3]` or `4` is fine, it just implies that there are some zeros present for the remaining variables i.e. you can treat them the same as `[1,3,0]` and `[4,0,0]` - You can reuse library functions like `itertools.permutations` to go from the combination of integers to a specific ordering. That is, you only need to compute the combination of integers `[1,3,0]` once, after that you can use a permutation function to generate `[0,1,3]`, `[1,0,3]` etc. without having to go to the trouble of working out how to satisfy the constraint on the sum every time, since you know that satisfying the sum is already a property of that set of integers `{0,1,3}` 
Step 1: convert addresses to Lat/Lng: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.shanelynn.ie/batch-geocoding-in-python-with-google-geocoding-api/amp/ Step 2: convert pairs of Lat/Lng to distances using the haversine formula. Make sure to vectorize for performance if you have a lot of addresses. https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2016-09-07/haversine-with-python/ I do this fairly frequently for work, so I have a paid API for google maps, but I believe they give you 2000 free uses a day. 
While this might seem true and granular is good for tests. Python caches the import after it sees it the first time. So after the first test it will not reimport the library in the next test. Use a global counter to verify this.
Hi, I guys I posted this module yesterday on this subreddit. The reason why I am posting this again is because I want people who can test this module and I am not using twilio API this time. I would like to thanks redditors on this subreddit who pointed out and gave me a new direction on how to fix this module by using something `sms_gateways` Lastly I would like to thank you guys and now this module is complete i would really appreciate if you try this out btw i tried on tmobile and it works fine.

You want to generate all the partitions of 10 (your constraint) into no more than n parts, where n is the length of your array. These are the [restricted partitions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(number_theory)#Restricted_part_size_or_number_of_parts) of 10 (although there are other possible restrictions are often also called "restricted partitions"). Now, usually a partition is ordered in the sense of the parts being listed in, say, descending order. But you can use inside-out Fisher-Yates to initialize your array using the nth part of the partition. 
go to /r/learnpython and search for project.
The problem with this is that you have to know the wireless carrier. 
This site's scrolling gave me cancer.
Yeah you right but it‚Äôs better than using a Twilio api which was expensive 
You could make a script to rename all image files in a directory to a consistant format (like the time the image was taken, for example). I found this useful when backing up images from my phone, where different applications have different naming standards.
I'm sincerely hoping this is a shitpost...... 
Yet many open source libraries and core python does it. There is always an exception.
What happens is that it sees a module you have already imported in your sys.modules and.doesn't try again But this breaks if you use the from x import y syntax since you need to get to the end of x
Largely speaking there are two directions in cyber security: external and internal. External is more about networking since that is typically your attack surface: layering, protocols, infrastructure. Internal: is a secondary vector and it typically starts when your already have access to a system. This is about exploiting program and OS faults. Each direction requires a deeper understanding of the affairs surface; in both cases scripting, with some frequency done in python, is more of a helper, an assistant rather than the body of work as it would be in say typical programming/development. 
I had heard of Hugo but I only shortlisted Python SFGs, but now I have looked at the Hugo website I am very impressed by the themes available, so I have deleted this post, not to waste anybody else's time, as I definitely going with Hugo, thanks!
/u/nathanjell is correct and furthermore you have a similar issue if the Java library is using JNI. Pure Java doesn‚Äôt require compilation and neither does pure Python. Throw in lower-level/native code and the problem, cause, and solutions are the same between the two.
That's why I said "generally". There of course are cases.

It depends how dependent your program is on the import. If you have a library that you import once in a blue moon and don't expect all users to install, then putting it into a function helps keep start up times low and the program from breaking completely.
Cool.
I exposed this sort of functionality -- [test-suite for the service is here](https://gist.github.com/hasandiwan/7efbd34561f10086c41366af5ec9e6e2) a few days ago -- modulo geoencoding -- if you'd like that, let me know and I'll add it in. It'll probably take me a few hours and I'll let you know when it's ready to go.
I was tired or trying to find a database that provides - Transparent access via Python objects. No ugly joins/indexes/rows. Just python objects with attributes and methods. I needed to use some exotic data structures, and implementing them in rdbms tables was a nightmare. - Supports transitions. - Supports efficient data versioning. O(log n) undo and redo from current database location to any point in history. - Stores all data as human readable (json) - Provides efficient and simple client side caching (in memory) None matched the criteria (zodb did, but it had terrible reviews). So I ended up creating my own database layer that supports all that. Ended up with 1 metaclass, 3 descriptors, 1 context manager and 1500 lines. So it wasn't difficult at all. Of course, I sacrificed scaling guarantees and a solid, tested and proven database in favor of my requirements. Coming to your question, you're looking at it from the wrong perspective You want a database abstraction that's non leaky, as in, you can keep your business logic separate from the db logic. This only works for very trivial usecases, since the truth is that every abstraction is leaky! As soon as you hit a twisted use case, you need to break the abstraction and tinker with the internals (raw sql queries/manual indexes in sqlalchemy). The correct way IMO is to make sure that when you break the abstraction, you are confident in your knowledge of the internals. 
Yes. I did something similar for a massive monolith Django project. All business logic is neatly split into multiple Python files that are carefully named to highlight and group the business logic specific to a usecase. All functions in these files never ever use any of the ORM specific code. Instead, you would create another set of objects which are identical to Django models. These objects are called as DAO (Data Access Object). They are placed in a file called dao.py or in a package called dao (if you have lots of DAOs in multiple files). They are identical to Django models with additional abstraction on top. For example, if you need to fetch 'n' number of articles from database with an optional category filter, you'll create a DAO for the Article model, ArticleDao, add a method to it, get_articles(count=None, category_id=None) with all parameters optional. If no parameters are specified, it will return all the articles in the system. This method will return a list of ArticleDao objects instead of an Article queryset. The DAO layer is also bidirectional. If you want to add an article in the database, you'll create an add_article() in ArticleDao which takes in all the fields the article requires, uses the ORM to create the entry in database and then return an equivalent ArticleDao object. One issue with the above approach is, you lose the flexibility to do adhoc queries like the one you would have if you were to use the ORM. You would need to create methods for almost all the usecases that you would encounter.
I‚Äôm done with the script 
The BeeWare project is both a great idea to bring Python to mobile platforms and also does a great job onboarding new contributors. I suggest anyone who wants to get involved with an open source project check them out: https://pybee.org/

So instead of the scroll jacking, would you prefer 3 buttons at the very top of the page to go up, left or right, and 3 buttons at the bottom of the page to go left right or down? That would have been a lot easier to implement.

I wrote a [series of blog posts](https://io.made.com/introducing-command-handler/) about the [ports and adapters](https://codingcanvas.com/hexagonal-architecture/) architectural style in Python, including a post on [the repository/unit of work patterns](https://io.made.com/repository-and-unit-of-work-pattern-in-python/). I'd be happy to answer any questions about how to *actually really really* put all your logic into your domain model, and keep the infrastructure outside.

I made a program over the weekend to scrap a particular train website for new tickets (it was horrible refreshing the page, waiting for them to release tickets at who knows what time).

I keep my code snippets so I can build simple programs quickly whenever little problems like this pop up in life. The last time i programmed was at least half a year before that weekend.

Hi, just use Django, if don't want spend a lot of time inventing wheels.
Same question here
Debating whether or not to take these certifications. My educated guess thus far having read up on some sites and forums is that an intermediate level user with familiarity in a few libraries plus the basics should be ok. I practice by tackling some projects within analytics without using built in library functions. Example: instead of pandas.unique(), I will try to use .set() I only assume that the exam will focus more on built in python packages and fundamental functions... But I do feel it may potentially get into numpy (arrays) 
Exactly. I rarely work with excel files and install a new environment for every project, so every now and then I get that ImportError at pd.read_excel(), and I'm only irritated that I forgot, not that it works that way. Pandas already takes an interminable 2.5 seconds to import on my laptop! 
I too have lived the horror of circular imports when modernizing someone else's code. 
I've generally had good experiences on Upwrok, if budget is limited look for people who just started (they charge less in order to get clients, I was one of them once many moons ago) but post lots of examples of their work, and Google the examples to make sure they're not stolen. 
Hey there, Anaconda usually comes with the recent version of python, which currently is 3.7. And it might also ignore that some libraries won't work with that version. Unless you have another library that persists to use python 3.7, you could change the version of python for example over the navigator app towards python 3.6.

That or something along those lines could work--any kind of fitting procedure will satisfy the derivatives, interpolation, and linear algebra requirements, and maybe the polynomial zeros if you're clever. Face recognition can operate using "eigenfaces". I guess the question is: what courses have you had that could benefit from any kind of numerical analysis?

Make a video [https://youtu.be/ZCPwpcurYns?t=255](https://youtu.be/ZCPwpcurYns?t=255)
You should downgrade to python 3.6
Your second method should take take proportional to the number of outputs, which is the best you can do (up to constant factors). But that can still be quite slow. What do you think the number of outputs is when constraint = 100? Roughly 100^5 = 10^10 (10 billion). 
Correct, this is the way that will want to go in. however, I am a little stuck when it comes to the part where I need to parse the yaml file for the hostname to put in the file string.

i'm kind of really interested, how did you do that? take in consideration im a newbie 
Ew!
Well it's really pretty simple. Using the Reddit Python API, you can visit specified subreddits and get information from them such as post urls, post titles, users who made the posts, comments etc. Most everything you could think of--you can grab. So I specified two subreddits to look at: r/memes &amp; r/EdgyMemes. Then from there, I indexed the url of the top 15 posts from the "hot" section of both subs into a list. I iterated through the list for each item (url) and saved each url as a picture. Then I use selenium to do some autobrowsing, open up instagram and input a few fields, and the rest is basically telling script to point and click/type at x,y coords. &amp;#x200B; The script runs once an hour, and it updates the meme each hour by replacing the count of the meme# using a txt file that reads the current meme#, and then writes the last meme# used so it can increment it by one for the next run. The captions are randomized based on a list I have that just has a few phrases. Pretty simple! I just wish I knew of another way to interact with the windows client/instagram other than using point/click. It's not very efficient. Unfortunately the instagram api doesn't allow users to post :/
Why the disgust?
I'm working on a private image repository API in python which will back a mobile app. I don't like irrelevant images cluttering my phone album like wifi passwords, my post gym selfies etc. I will put them in this app through python api to some cdn. Any recommendation is welcome!
I *think* we're almost on the same page, except I have another layer. So your DAO would call Django's ORM directly, like class MyThingDao: def get_articles(): return MyThing.objects.all() Would it also serialize everything it gets back from the DB so it returns plain python objects as opposed to querysets? If so how did you accomplish that?
Yes, actually only Step 3 requires Linux! You can still train your model with YOLO using "darkflow" which works for windows. The original YOLO requires Linux tho.

Hi! For your first example I would use apply : data[x] = data.apply(lambda row: row['a'] if row['b'] &gt; 4 else np.nan, axis=1) I find it quite readable and akin to list comprehensions. I would also use apply for the other examples. Do you have any other example were your module would have a better readability that vanilla pandas ?

That's all fair. My response is twofold: 1. I try to avoid `apply` over rows because it is much slower on a large data set. I also don't see that heavily `apply`-based style used much in the wild 2. I personally think `lambda` syntax adds a lot of visual clutter and leads to very long lines of code that don't break very nicely, making it good for one-liners but fatiguing to read over time.
That sounds interesting. Have any example code?
&gt; I don't think I can define them after the .exe You can, just use the command prompt normally! Before turning to exe: C:\Folder&gt; python myscript.py --username foo --password bar --hostname baz After turning to exe C:\Folder&gt; myscript.exe --username foo --password bar --hostname baz

I've just finished building a random proxylist creator for an article scraper I'm building. Took me long to make the proxy creator because I've tried to initially use scrapy for the project, but I don't really like "creating" with all the "batteries included" features that scrapy provides. Considering another platform for a webdev use case, I liked django very much compared to flasks minimalistic approach. Idk what to conclude with this btw. Back to the project, I'll start coding the {news}spider subclass tomorrow, which would inherit attr from the spider subclass. The {news}spider would fetch news links from a news source and dump the links to a postgres db. The next action is to categorize the links as containing news or containing not news. Anyway, 1. the near end goal is to have a single Parent scraper class having multiple child scraper classes for specific domains. 2. the far end goal is to create a dataset that contains the features: pubDate, upDate, scrapeDate, title, abstract, label, tag, body (maybe I'll add more?). This would be achieved by fetching the content of links that are categorized as news, for example.

this pretty much answers your original question run a survey to learn what cool basic program they need
I'm working in different projects. When I'm home, I'm working on a budget system which basically maintains a spreadsheet. Every month I download the csv for that month from my bank, run it through the program, and it updates the spreadsheet by assigning transactions to certain categories depending on the company. If it's an unknown, it'll prompt to assign it to a category
How do you meter the requests?

You're welcome.
&gt;When I discovered Python was like when Aladdin flies with Jasmine in the flying carpet. a more eloquent statement has never been said.
Thanks for answering! I guess we just come from different communities. Maybe you could give the apply version as an example in your readme and explain why your approach is better in some cases (large dataset).
Those are some great articles. I'm not sure if something like the command handler makes sense for my system. Here is some code I put together. I envision most of the business logic living inside of `ParentUseCase`. Would love some feedback. # SQLAlchemy models. Base is from SQLAlchemy class Parent(Base): __tablename__ = 'parent' id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True) children = relationship("Child") class Child(Base): __tablename__ = 'child' id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True) parent_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('parent.id')) # Domain models class ParentDomain: def __init__(self, id, children=None): self.id = id self.children = children or [] @classmethod def from_dict(cls, d): return ParentDomain( id=d['id'], children=[ChildDomain.from_dict(c) for c in d.get('children')] ) class ChildDomain: def __init__(self, id, parent_id=None): self.id = id self.parent_id = parent_id @classmethod def from_dict(cls, d): return ChildDomain( id=d['id'], parent_id=d.get('parent_id') ) # Data access layer class ParentDataAccess: model = Parent def get_all(self): return [ParentDomain.from_dict(p) for p in session.query(self.model).all()] class ParentUseCase: repo = ParentDataAccess def get_all_parents(self): return self.repo.get_all()
This makes me want to kill myself
Lol delete this comment, you‚Äôre giving away a great idea 
lol
Glad we have people like you to support those of us who are trying to learn.
I would use a list comprehension: row['x'] = [a if b &gt; 4 else np.nan for a, b in zip(row['a'], row['b'])]
Thank you for your service
You don't need to use commands and handlers to benefit from this style of layering. The important concept is that infrastructure and orchestration code depends on your domain, not the other way round. That makes it easier to distill your business logic into the domain model and to refactor aggressively when it gets messy. It's hard for me to comment on your sample code because I don't have a clear understanding of your domain model or what you're trying to achieve. What are you actually building? Is there a reason why you want to use JSON serialisation with SQL Alchemy? If you're mapping all your classes down to JSON, why use SQLAlchemy declarative mappings at all? You could just use psycopg2 directly, or SQLAlchemy Core. &gt; I envision most of the business logic living inside of ParentUseCase. I would say that generally it's important NOT to put your "business logic" into "use cases". The use-case classes, or command handlers, are there to provide orchestration. Your interesting business logic goes in the domain model. If you don't have any real business logic, then you may as well just use Django, or an Excel spreadsheet.
Holy shit this makes it so much slicker, faster, and just simpler. Thanks!
Will do. BTW here's yet another way to write the example: data['x'] = data['a'].where(data['b'] &gt; 4, other=np.nan) That is actually how I would do it; I should add it to the docs. It's especially useful because `other` can be another `array`/`Series`, or a callable. Also, as I'm writing this, I'm realizing that the big difference for me is that *the `with_column` version is an expression that returns a data frame*, rather than a statement that operates on a data frame. That's what makes it "chainable".
That's one very Pythonic way to go Unfortunately, "manually" iterating over Pandas (and Numpy) data structures will be much slower than the vectorized versions, in general. Coming from R, I'm already in the habit of doing as much work vectorized as possible, so this stuff is good to see. Maybe in the future Pandas would let you write naive list comprehensions that "compile" to fast vectorized operations (like how PonyORM works).
There's been generative music for years. Interesting that this one seems restricted to midi tho.

So first, I appreciate the idea. I love pandas but agree it can be too verbose. Unlike some of the other comments, I think that the pandas code you code is the best way to do the examples you gave - anything else will be much slower. I've dealt with large data sets in pandas where doings properly (i.e. vectorization) is the difference between seconds/a couple minutes and hours. In terms of how useful this is, a quick look indicates it is mainly useful for modifying or creating columns based on some criteria. If so, for my personal use, it is not something I do very much and certainly not enough to bother with a new package. Are there other use-cases? And to be clear.... that's just my workflow/data. Maybe it is more common for others. 
I went ahead and [did a fun little side project]([https://github.com/chuckinator0/Projects/tree/master/scripts/alert\_exercise](https://github.com/chuckinator0/Projects/tree/master/scripts/alert_exercise)) that does what you want, if you'd like to compare your solution to mine. Mine will bring up a message to alert a person at a specific email address if the IP address they are responsible for doesn't respond to `ping`. It can be extended to actually send emails with `smtplib` as well.

&gt; In terms of how useful this is, a quick look indicates it is mainly useful for modifying or creating columns based on some criteria. ... Are there other use-cases? Honestly, not that I that can think of, in its current state. I tend to do a lot of column assignments in the data cleaning stage of my workflow. &gt; for my personal use, it is not something I do very much and certainly not enough to bother with a new package. Out of curiosity, what are you mostly doing with Pandas if not columnwise operations? Joining? Groupby aggregations or pivots? A lot of that stuff is already pretty pipelineable. Would you mind sharing an example of a typical Pandas workflow you might use? ---- In theory this `Col` business could be abstracted to a kind of lazy computation graph. So instead of `Col` it could be called `G` (for graph), and you could use it to construct arbitrary callable "pipelines". In that sense it would become a truly general system for constructing anaphoric functions. But since metaprogramming in Python is already so limited, too much generality might wipe away any of the ergonomic benefits. I'm having a hard time envisioning a concise API for such a general case that also isn't offensively magical (and internally fragile). If it's even a tiny bit too verbose, `lambda` remains the lesser of two evils pretty much by default, because you don't need to learn it or `pip install` it. With `Col` at least, it's easy to explain how it See also: everything-is-lazy-by-default `itertools`. Imagine if you could write `lambda x: tuple(map(op.add(3), x))` as something like `(x) :: tmap(op.add(3), x)` -- it's now about as concise than a list comprehension like `lambda x: tuple(y+3 for y in x)` and (in my opinion) just as readable. Just one piece of special syntax and a bunch of utility aliases are the only thing standing between Python and a whole new world of functional programming style. Maybe by this time next year I'll just be using Julia where we don't have to perform such gyrations to avoid basic row-wise iteration. But I am definitely interested in finding the balance between generality and concision.
We had statics, kinematics, math 1 and 2 (complex numbers, derivatives, integrals, limits, linear algebra, D.E., ...), strength/mechanics of materials, physics, SolidWorks and a course about materials. This was all in the first year and right now in the second year we have: thermodynamics, math 3, materials 2 and machine elements (I don't know how you call it in english but it's a course about sprockets, seals, welds,... and how to dimension them and stuff like that). 
It's a bit of a hack but it works. I used it for this (and other things) a while back: https://github.com/impshum/Multi-Quote
I'm a sys admin for 2 years so yes I do know what the command prompt is ;)
I presume by its position (25,13) that the value in the cell is supposed to evaluate the data in some way. This value will always be the same as you havent yet opened excel for it to refresh the formulas. remember that openpyxl, xlsxwriter and xlwt are all just file manipulators, they are not an Excel API. You can avoid making the temporary file by using the IO module: https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html, or alternatively construct the filename in python and you can load the excel template directly into the pandas excelwriter and save to the final sheet in one step.
I'm disappointed by the dismissive comments here. Your negativity and snobbery are not Pythonic. Congratulations OP on developing the project you set out to make!

I saw this in the readme from pandas_anaphora import register_anaphora, Col register_anaphora_methods() Checked the source and my fears were confirmed. Why monkey-patching and metaclasses? Inheritance wouldn't work?
