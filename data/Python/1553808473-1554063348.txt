Yes please. Would love to have a look at what you have and learn from it Im working on a slack one as well (to query against another internal api) but really want to learn how you handle the Dialogflow and Gsuite API
Thank you for sharing this
They are both pretty amazing
I am ok at it, basics and some modules do you know basics? I can help you if You want.
If you have na experience with any gui technology, I found pyQT5 faster to get rolling with. 
Is this going to work inside an app? I mean if I do a registering app with different users, would this store the user's data in somewhere?
Seems like a custom version of hi-low game, good idea to start with python this way
I'm creating an order/invoicing platform using django and mysql. You will input an order, it will add it to the database, email the customer an order form receipt, email an invoice to the correct supplier, print out the invoice, save a copy of each and populate a few google sheets files

such a nice simple GUI kit with the added benefit of seamless cross platform integration and potentially decent web interface. Its still not feature complete. But its slowly getting there!
Plenty of videos on YouTube, then check out edx.org its free u can take college courses from top notch universities at no cost.
Thanks I’ll lookin into edx.org

The problem here is that you're using IDLE.
Probably one for r/learnpython But notebooks are really great for trying things out because you can run different sections at a time - you could write a class or a function run that cell, then write a test in another cell and run that. It's great for trying things out. It's also markdown cells where you can explain or comment on what you're doing - you could use this on something like data analytics to show your process, or to show how you arrived at a solution. It's well worth trying it out. 
It's not a different version, just a different interface. whether you use an integrated development environment such Spyder or Jupyter, it is the same python engine in the background in the same python code. The Notebook environment is good for scripting and interactive exploration. I would certainly recommend you be familiar with it. if you have installed anaconda on your system, then you have both.
tried console and cmd .-.
Thank you! I've been waiting for years. I was so happy to see the ticket updated this morning!
This is pretty cool: [http://mewo2.com/notes/terrain/](http://mewo2.com/notes/terrain/) When it comes to editing it yourself, the way I'd go about it would be converting it into an SVG and using Inkscape to move points around. You may want to simplify the coastline first, which I'd do with the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm ([shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) will probably help you here). To get the outline of an object you can use [image contouring](http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/edges/plot_contours.html), and to convert those pixels into a line you'd be best off using something like [skan](https://jni.github.io/skan/).
Pretty much this. One doesn't utilize Python to speed things up, but perhaps bring them on a higher level if necessary and at that keep the general readability
!Don't remind me of anything
"Automate the boring stuff". Get that book (the book is online also). There's a section about scheduling scripts and programs. This book has been recommended a ton, and for good reason. This is where I started and it helped me create some simple, but powerful programs (powerful in a sense where I don't have to do the mundane when I can create a program to do it). 
Whether or not it's worth it probably depends on what you do. I've used an awk script here or there, but there's months in-between instances of me really needing this. As a result, I basically have to re-learn syntax every time and it just makes more sense for me to use the tools I know better.
Selenium on Python is often used for such purposes. [https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) 
As someone who doesn't know much bash, what's bad about this code?
Depends on what you mean by an app. It would be easy to setup a JSON API to retrieve this data and store it in a DB. But without seeing this tutorial I doubt this tutorial covers that and probably just stores info in a local DB

You could build a circuit with a pressure transducer and an ADC, then translate those voltages to inputs on a controller interface.

That whole file gets stuck in an infinite loop for me. Because `swap()` only reassigns the variables inside the function itself, variables in the callee still point to old values. Once I inlined that function, everything worked as expected.

Thanks for sharing the feedback :)

Yes, you're very right... Whichever one I pick to start solving a problem in, at some point suddenly one of the others would have been more naturally expressive for the next step, so you end up with something where a bash one liner would be great if you could follow it with a quick bit of python, and then jump back to awk/sed... To help with that trade-off, I actually wrote a pipeline runner that lets me do just that - have a step with bash command followed by a python script followed by whatever you want to invoke... All sequenced via a lightweight yaml pipeline, with some extra bits I find useful for retries, loops and yaml/json config processing. I put it on GitHub here: https://github.com/pypyr/pypyr-cli
Coded some easy retry functionality for an open source project I'm working on... https://github.com/pypyr/pypyr-cli - name: pypyr.steps.cmd description: this step will retry up to 10x if the cmd returns an error. retry: max: 10 # retry up to 10 times sleep: 5 # 5s sleep between retries in: cmd: arbcmd --that could --totally fail
Belongs in r/learnpython, but oh well. I don't know for sure, but I'd probably guess it's one of these (or both): * something about the way the server/client is coded doesn't suit a system with more than one client * the server has to do some kind of muxing for the multiple audio streams coming in and it isn't, so the voice packets are being transmitted wrong If you've already accounted for both of these then I've got no clue
thanks for your contribution
It's either a QoS issue on your network or your application can't handle the amount of UDP packets coming in.
Publish it to pypi from TravisCI, update the instructions with the appropriate `pip install`.
I've used pyqt, pyside, and wxwidgets for various personal projects but I don't recall ever seeing any job openings looking for them. Anyone here use these professionally? 
I should have explained a bit more: I work at a company that uses AWS. We store a majority of our data in redshift, but there are certain parts of the business that use other (separate) databases for information storage. S3 is a data lake of sorts - it’s a place where those people that store information in other databases can send data so that we can get it into redshift for reporting purposes. (S3 serves more purposes than just this, but for the sake of this explanation that is the one we will focus on). There is a specific business department that uses a separate sql server 2014 database to store information associated with warehouse transactions. They’ve set up a cron job to send small one hour portions of data to s3, but are limited in their export capabilities so the data format they send can’t be immediately ingested in a normal copy command by redshift. This is where python, the boto3 library, and airflow come into play. You can think of airflow as a scheduler that is built and maintained in python. Boto3 is a python library that allows you to communicate and send information to and from s3. I use airflow to schedule a python script (known as a DAG) to grab and parse the data, then write it the parsed data to redshift using s3 as an intermediary. Boto3 and airflow really work beautifully together. Hope this helped!
Yes please I’d love to see it! Sounds awesome. 
Yes PyQt and PySide full-time in the VFX Industry. Most of all our software comes with PySide2 directly. So easy to use and really stable
Have you tried Python Anywhere?
Hi! Former Telecom engineer here. I'm not going to read your code right now, because it's late, and I'm about to go to bed. You should look up and read about "jitter buffers". Also try to add some performance measuring code to compare how much time it takes you to mux X amount (in time) of audio on the server. If it takes anything close to the time to mux it as it the amount of audio the sample contains, then once you add round-trip latency, it will stutter. If you continue to have issues after doing some research and troubleshooting, I'll be happy to help further.
/r/learnpyt....oh...wait, /r/PHPhelp thanks for keeping us on our toes!
PyCharm is so good, that if it gets Atom One Dark or One Dark Pro, it would seriously make me consider my life choices.
Your send and receive threads both read data off that your UDP socket, but one sends the data to your audio stream and the other sends the data back to whoever sent it. That doesn't seem likely to be correct behaviour. Likely what you need is a way for clients to register and then for each packet that comes in on the UDP socket send it out to all the clients _except_ the one who sent it to the server. Also, I the server really supposed to have its own audio stream? Servers would usually just route packets between clients and not actually play any audio. Of course, once you have multiple clients you need to worry about multiplexing. If there are three client, each client will be sending one stream and receiving two streams. Which received stream should the client copy to its audio output stream? There are a few ways to deal with that. One is for the server to multiplex all the streams it receives into a single stream so that listening to the new stream you can hear everything everyone says. The audio library probably has a way to do that and it's an easy fix. Of course, when enough people start talking at once it gets more and more difficult to understand them. That problem is sometimes solved by having one stream be the "speaker" and just copying their stream to the other clients. If someone else wants to be heard they need to become the speaker first. To determine who is speaker you can analyse the streams, drop all the clients sending "silence" and then picking a speaker at random from the streams that are left. The more you dig into this problem the more difficulties you'll run into. Hang in there. It _is_ possible to build a decent audio client/server with some basic knowledge. Good luck. 
To clarify, I Use VS Code and Visual studio for a living and do some python on the side.
Agree! www.pythonanywhere.com
When the only tool you use is a hammer...
It's probably best to put a reverse proxy in front of it, like Apache or Nginx. If your aiohttp server crashes, your proxy server can still respond with some kind of error page or a maintenance page. You can also use load balancing on the reverse proxy, say you have 8 cores on the server, your Python app won't use more than 1 core, even with asyncio, because of the GIL. So you could spawn your aiohttp app 8 times and have the proxy dispatch calls to each of those 8 apps, fully utilizing your cores. There's also the security aspect, Apache and Nginx are proven tools used by millions of server, and most Linux distros would patch security issues within a few days. aiohttp is fairly recent project that fewer people use, so if your application deals with sensitive information, I wouldn't expose it directly to the web.
Abstractions IMO need to be written top down. Nobody cares how cool your implementation is if your API sucks. 
Thanks for the read, valuable information for me. I will do further research!
Seems easier a lot of the time to just write 3 lines of python instead of chaining a bunch of utilities. 
Aloof this, plus the reverse proxy can implement caching, so if your app server crashes you can still serve from cache while you’re sorting it out. 
Thanks for the read, I will definitively look further into it!
Python is just a programming language that can do many things from data analytics to building a web application, or even building mobile games. Specializing in something (field + industry) in my personal opinion is always better than knowing alittle bit of everything. Figure out what you like to do, then search job postings on related skills and libraries, then focus on learning those Python libraries. Just make sure you have a very strong fundamental grasp of Python before you start looking around. 
That's different; while this does have a basic interpreter included, its presumably just for testing the results and its main program is a transpiler.
I second this, and would add to it by noting that programming languages - all of them - are just tools to help you solve problems. If you were a carpenter would you write that you’re and expert in the use of hammers on your resume? No, you’d showcase projects you’ve built with those tools. Nothing changes because you happen to build with bits instead of nails. All that to say: find yourself a project to put your Python in action and then showcase what you’ve built in your portfolio/resume/etc. 
and if this doesn't work, run terminal on admin.

The fact that people think this is the reason web dev is such a shit show.
I should have been clearer. I'm not a developer (just a sys admin/engineer). I am using a project that uses aiohttp as its web server for personal use but I have it behind nginx as a reverse proxy with basic auth because as you point out nginx is proven in the real world. However I am concerned that other users are port forwarding directly to aiohttp instances in blind faith that the projects password protection is sufficient security for an internet connected service. I may be being paranoid but I trust nginx more than aiohttp.
I'd suggest you continue on the tutorial you are following now. Try jupyter again later.
Interesting article! I actually love prime number algorithms, and i thought the implementation seemed kinda slow without numba, so i gave it a shot with a pure numpy implementation. def sieve_python_np(limit): if limit &lt; 2: return np.array([]) if limit &lt; 3: return np.array([2]) is_prime = np.ones(limit+1, dtype=np.bool) is_prime[4::2] = 0 for d in range(3, int(np.sqrt(limit))+1, 2): if is_prime[d]: is_prime[d*d::d] = 0 return np.nonzero(is_prime)[0][2:] using the same test cases: print(elapse_time('sieve_python(100000)')) print(elapse_time('sieve_python_jit(100000)')) print(elapse_time('sieve_python_np(100000)')) and got the following results: &amp;#x200B; |sieve\_python|1.867 seconds|| |:-|:-|:-| |sieve\_python\_jit|0.146 seconds|| |sieve\_numpy\_jit|0.051 seconds|| |sieve\_python\_np|0.032 seconds|| &amp;#x200B; numpy allows for really fast operations if you use its logical indexing. You can also speed up larger runs by using a segmented sieve: [https://primesieve.org/segmented\_sieve.html](https://primesieve.org/segmented_sieve.html) &amp;#x200B;
Forgot to mention.. The reason why the server has the audio stream is because if I don't have it, I won't hear anything.
PyQt5 is much more powerful, but the docs absolutely suck and there isn’t very much community support.
How would they connet to the aiohttp port of it's only bound to localhost?
Home Assistant is a widely used python server built on aiohttp and it's definitely used on the web (although the project maintainers would rather they not). It's had it's share of security scares but as far as I know aiohttp was never the culprit. I'm not saying it's as secure as nginx or Apache but it's not php4 either. Trawl through HAs discord or email logs if you want to learn more. 
For reference, this kind of question is better suited for /r/learnpython. That said, there are a couple of other communities that would be really helpful for you too, * /r/arduino * /r/raspberry_pi And arduino is a microcontroller development board that's very popular and has a lot of resources to help you figure out how to use it. A raspberry pi is a cheap little computer that is very beginner programmer friendly. Both boards have gpio pins (general purpose in out: basically just a set of connections you can program to do different things) and those give you the opportunity to connect different sensors. With the microcontroller or raspberry pi, you can make a program to listen to a sensor (like a microphone) and then when someone is blowing on it, perform an action. At first I'd just turn on a light (LED) so you know the microphone and code is working, then later you could connect it to the computer to make the computer do something. [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/) has a ton of products, materials, and tutorials that are perfect for this as well! This is an awesome world to start getting into, and I wish you the best of luck! 
Does it work faster comparing to standard lib heap?
 Did you install from the directly from the git repo? See [here](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy/issues/211#issuecomment-369863112). `pip install git+https://github.com/plamere/spotipy.git --upgrade` &amp;#x200B;
you mean output from cells? Clear output before export 
https://imgur.com/CCctERA The date and heading
What date you want to remove? The date in the file metadata? If the date is stored in the ipynb, copy it to a temporary folder, run a script that removes dates and then export. Otherwise some pdf save data in plain text, open pdf in text editor and see if you can find the date.
Actually date comes automatically when I export as pdf, in my Jupyter Notebook I have only code, nothing else, heading and date comes automatically! 
if you want to achieve a central app, you will need to host it somewhere. The pi should make a remote api request to your app, so it would need Internet connection. possible hosting solutions are aws, Google cloud,.. 
Hey! No, i just did the imports with Pycharm. Im using Windows. Maybe I will be switching becauase I think its easier on Linux
No. It's an issue with Spotipy not having the lastest version on pip. If you install from the Git it should work.
Thanks all, I've since rectified the problem. cv2.findContours(dilate_image.copy(), cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)[0]. Where previously [0] was [1]. Index 1 was causing the issue. Just a version difference issue in opencv 4.0 In CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE 
I've heard this book mentioned, I've also seen it advertised on Amazon Kindle store. If you think it will help I will look at buying it. 
TKinter is good if it fits your needs.
It's a question of licensing. Anaconda have a deal with Intel, and give access to numpy built with mkl by default. Otherwise you will have to built it yourself, which can be a hell if you are on windows. And it's far to be necessary if you are not doing heavy numerical computation. 
Wonderful! Do you know if its possible to install It easily on Windows?
Bigger question, why are you still using Python 2.7?
Nope They Just sent me an email that I have a programming language to take They had 3 options Java,C++ and Python 
Ok thanks
broken how?
I haven't but I have a friend who uses it to make nice little interfaces for various factory floor monitoring programs. He told me they weren't very complicated apps though, mostly buttons graphs and information boxes. 
im not sure what your question is, are you recieving an exception? struggeling to implement that portioin of the code? what? from a quick look through, the statement: for "password &lt;" in list_data: print(line, end="") will throw an exception. it should be in the form for item in iterator: where item is a variable name rather than a string. you also need to read() a file that is being opened and assign that read data to a variable. try something like: with open(myfile, 'r') as file: data = file.read() and then check for matches: for item in data: if item == 'password &lt;': do stuff.... also, unless its required for the assignment, its best not to over comment your code. we all want our code to be understandable but things such as import statements and file.close() are pretty self explainatory.
&gt;But I don’t want to learn multiple gnu utilities.. I guess I learned the utilities before Python was invented . I love Python, but on a cmmand line, sometimes `perl -p -i -e ...` or `some_command_producing_stdout | sed ... | sort | uniq -c | tee some_file.log | less` just trips off the fingers :-) &amp;#x200B;
Hello I am not at all surprise to know that Python is now the most questioned programming language in StackOverFlow . Python popularity is increasing very rapidly not only in StackOverFlow but in each and every plat form. The main reason for its high demand and popularity is its easy syntax, variety of frameworks and library which it provides. Python is used as a major programming language in web development, education, GUI application, Scientific application, Data Science, Robotic and many more. I personally think if we [Learn the Concept of Python](http://www.cetpainfotech.com/technology/python-training) well then we can make our future bright because it is been used in almost each and every application. 
Can someone give an example of when you'd be creating a user account on a desktop application as opposed to a web form?
The trouble is at the end where i need to filter the file and count the number of less than errors and greater than errors. 
So a weighted https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process ?
You can use aiohttp in prod, like said, in front of reverse proxy or load balancer. Nginx is great, while other more modern approach are far better BUT younger and maybe less stable. Traefik or Ambassador on a kubernetes cluster make your app really scalable and safe. You can have n instances of your aiohttp application taking the load silently. So, yes, aiohttp is production ready, but not alone, and the final solution depends on your environment 
Sure, thanks for the input!
I learned wx, just wanted to know which one offers more options etc.
I’m no expert and have no idea if this could work (but I know someone will reply letting me know!). Could you open the page with a selenium web driver and pass the page source into beautiful soup?

When you compile it you get a folder that contains your program and all dependancies, it is fully "portable" in that it doesn't create files elsewhere on a system, so yes, you zip up that folder and that's your release, you delete the folder to "uninstall"
1. You can write functions in bash but the author didn't bother. 2. It's a good habit to use $() instead of \`\`; the former can be nested and has less escaping issues. 3. The error message for the if $PID logic is wrong. 4. Lots of opportunity to DRY. 5. Minor peeve; I prefer the one-liner "for x in y; do", "if x; then" instead of the linebreak What else?
I dislike the type hints very much. I don't mind them in docstrings but they make definitions very hard to read. If you need types this much maybe use a typed language.

There's nothing wrong with aiohttp. Your concern is more with the security of the project's authentication and other aspects of its design, which are entirely divorced from aiohttp and impossible for us to answer here. Suffice to say that if there's a security issue in a setup like you've described, it won't stem from aiohttp.

With PyQt5 you can literally build anything, so to your question and your requirement, yes, PyQt5 can do the job just fine. However, the downside is, PyQt has a pretty steep learning curve (I think licensing shouldn't be an issue in your case since your software will be distributed as an open source) comparing to other GUI libraries.
Makes sense, thanks for the input.
Allright thanks for the response. Yes we are aware of the steep learning curve, luckily we have quite some time for the project!
Its okay I found the cause, I'd made a C callback using ctypes and it was causing the crashes. 
The writing is just barely better than incoherent.
Then I think you and your buddies should go for it. In my opinion, it is a good investment since the recycle value is great.

I agree. The organization of the piece also wasn’t very logical. 
I was going to suggest this; I only read about it yesterday, but it looks ideal for the OP’s purposes.
Do you have an array of pixels? You could produce a new one and just make every pixel 4x bigger, then you can just multiply all your positions by 4x and it will still work. 
Installed it on my Mac (from the DMG on GitHub), but when I launch the app it auto closes after less than a second. Do I have to set up anything else?
I realise this is a contrived example from an educational context and not real code, but seeing a reference to maximum password length still makes me cringe. How are junior developers supposed to have any hope of hitting the ground running in a job when they’ve seen things like that in their homework? 
Thanks for your help! We gonna try it and see how far we come :)
Haha, thx. :)
If Google Drive is not a requirement you may try the [Multiplayer mode](https://repl.it/site/blog/multi) with [Repl.it](https://repl.it/).
I second this. I feel like this is exactly what you'd be looking for. Also, you can run a python terminal inside of vs code [like this](https://i.imgur.com/uvcU7V5.png) with an extension. To run my code I save(Ctrl+s) and then do ctrl+alt+n to run it. There's also the run button in the top right. You can run multiple instances at once as well inside of it and even split them side by side. There's a file accessible from preferences to edit the styling of it like mine if you choose. So this combined with live share should work nicely for you.
Is this working with numpy arrays too?
for collaboration i think [live-share](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/11/15/live-share) in vs code would work better and you can run python from inside the IDE [like this\(screenshot of mine\)](https://i.imgur.com/uvcU7V5.png)
may want to get a programmable/layered keyboard as the [ is fairly extensively used in python. lists/indices/regex all make use of this character. is your layout similar to [this]( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/KB_Sweden.svg/640px-KB_Sweden.svg.png)? Maybe right alt 8/9 will get you there? Also how you use markdown and such without the square bracket?

1. mkdir -p omits the error he complained about when the dir already exists 2. don't parse ls! It's meant to produce human-readable output, not machine-parsable. Use echo to expand your glob patterns. 
Additionally, if you want to create an "installer", there are different tools, like NSIS.
It's been a couple of years so with any luck he'll see this post :) 
It’s what my comp sci teacher uses for our game programming class
I tried this and it said that ‘pip’ was unreconizable 
You can look into writing an [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com) script. This can help you bind something on your keyboard to input “[“ and “]”. Here is the [tutorial](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Tutorial.htm) on how to get started.
Awesome! Good job :)
A couple suggestions: 1) you’ll like want to use the “-F” option when building the exe— this creates a single file application [double-click and its running] .... note, this is a pyinstaller thing that works on win/Mac builds 2) if you want to “properly” install your application on someone else’s computer (and not just tell them to download or unzip you app) please look into using nsis or inno as installers (for Windows) or packages (for Mac/OSX). Incredibly helpful programs that create the folders and files you want to place during an install (also all the necessary message prompts too if those are needed). This is how you would facilitate an uninstall as well. 3) for application auto updates, pyupdater is bar-none the best (I’m using it and I love it) 
See I don’t know Perl either. I can write a disgusting python one liner really easy though 
Personally I like doing the one folder + installer route. Bigger programs with more dependencies have performance issues with the one file route. Even the smaller programs seem to take a few more seconds to start. 
I guess just thinking this internally and not creating the account wasn't enough...
Don’t forget if you start at the third index you can jump by two’s as well since we know any even number can’t be prime anyway. And the new solution is more the time I’d expect from numba! 
Installers and uninstallers are best made with other tools. Pyinstaller's just going to make a folder with your executable and its dependencies. Making a tool that places the folder in the correct place, writes to the registry, makes shortcuts, and creates an executable to undo all that later, requires something else. InstallShield would be an example of one.
Not to rain on your parade in any way, but more as a future exercise: * Preserve the doc string. * Preserve the calling signature. * Make the decorated function virtually indistinguishable from the real thing. 
Thanks... did I use `functools.update_wrapper` incorrectly?
Try r/learnpython or stack overflow

I looked through it... what does that do that `functools.update_wrapper` not do? [https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.update\_wrapper](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.update_wrapper)

No shit
I think if this just saves a one line compile command while enforcing what directory the c code goes in it might be easier to just have a makefile command to compile stuff if thats what's needed. 
I'd note that if OP is making use of the Windows AppData folders, I wouldn't call his app fully portable.
I make quite a few bots. This is how I would go about it. Keep in mind that I haven't tried this fully and I'm not sure if it would work on this site but this is what I'd try. import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup headers = { 'user-agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/5.0)', } sess = requests.Session() response = sess.get('http://www.sneakersnstuff.com/en/858/new-arrivals/', headers=headers) soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser') captcha_link = soup.find("iframe").get("src") form_submit = soup.find("form") print("open this link and fill out captcha") key = input("enter captcha response: ") /* code to submit the form data (including the captcha response to the link stored in form_submit */ I have't tried to actually submit the form but I'll let you take it from there. This is essentially a small scale version of what I'd do to get a google recaptcha.

Nice man! Works nice. Although with an album (Altered State by Overwerk) recently released I only get displayed the title of the song and not the lyrics.
I'm not sure what you meant by "I have nothing on you" and why you even commented in the first place, then?
Need to try that later. It is only in 2019 version thoe
'I have nothing on you' AKA 'This is no where near as sophisticated as your work' but its relevant and we're in a Python subreddit.
Yeah. Did that in The end
Ah, my bad; I read it as something like "I don't have anything against you".
Nice to see you again. Awesome.
Nice! Couple of questions: Is there a way of passing an auth token instead of giving my actual password? I log in with my facebook - any way this can work for me?
Hey, I see you made a fork using Genius as the lyrics source! Would be nice to add more sources as using just Google fails sometimes, will take a look.
Couldn't find how to use auth tokens. The code is on GitHub so you could launch your own instance to be sure the password is well treated, it's pretty straightforward. The FB integration should not be too painful. Will look at it. 
Hmm, I'm not sure, do you see it in the dock? If you open up Mac's Activity Monitor do you see "SocialAmnesia" running?
I was thinking about building something like this on my way to work today. What a great coincidence. Thanks!
You're welcome! Enjoy it!
One problem with `aiohttp` is that it immediately queues all requests and make make the RAM usage very very high. This could lead to DOS attack. However not a big concern for personal use.
Your video link isn't working.
Sooo… what does this do? From the hello world example it just seems like deferring wrapper for function calls.
Pyinstaller makes an exe and not an installer. Deleting it fully removes the program assuming you didn’t set any registry keys to save the state or your program. Not like people clean those up anyways... NSIS is the other popular thing that actually makes the installer and uninstaller. It’s yet another language and one that reminiscent of C and Assembly. For any custom bit, you have to get involved with the stack. There’s a python 2.7 module you can use (you’d have to build a 3.x version and there’s not really a reason to). You still have to mess with the stack and add arguments to registers, but at least you can parse a file. Error handling and making sure all the files are packaged is a bit of a challenge too. Basically, avoid NSIS if you can.
I was wondering the same thing too. It looks like the big advantage is it seems to handle errors well. You define a flow, and you can run the flow with a retry on failure count for instance. The docs would be much better if they compared each example with a traditional implementation and what the traditional one can't do.
There are some example uses on the docs at https://docs.prefect.io/guide/welcome/what_is_prefect.html
I did something a while back: https://github.com/eagleeggs/artifact/tree/master/scripts Might lead you in a direction.
Upvote!
Actually I’m pretty sure that is not best practice. There’s a more secure way to do it :P
The docs aren't very clear in saying what problem this library solves. The information is being imparted on me very well. I'm starting to get a gist of it, I believe. It sounds powerful, but I think simple real world comparisons between with and without would help quite a bit!
In the most encouraging way possible, "try harder" 
The license issue is a nonissue if you use PySide. You can also just write pyqt5, then use qtpy as a wrapper library. Then it’ll work in pyqt4, pyqt5, PySide, and PySide2. There’s a few inconsistencies, but it’s a day to port. Obviously better if you start with qtpy, but not the end of the world.
Another lyrics source is MusixMatch.
How does it compare with Dask DataFrames ([https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/)) ? 
Nice job. Do you have any gihub repo or something with the code and sensors used? 
You need to either specify the python executable to use when you're calling the script or reference it in the first line of the python script by using a [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix\)).
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sip-and-puff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sip-and-puff) &amp;#x200B;
Shazam shows you the lyrics and syncs it up to the song (because it only shows you few lines that are playing like karaoke). How hard would be to implement this?
winkey+r -&gt; cmd -&gt; enter -&gt; cd dir -&gt; python run.py up -&gt; enter up -&gt; enter up -&gt; enter
The bot can edit messages so it could show just a few lines and update them as the song plays. I'm missing how to know when to do the updates though. Will try to check how Shazam is doing it. 
Source: [https://github.com/Destroyerrockz/BatchMessage](https://github.com/Destroyerrockz/BatchMessage) . Please suggest improvements and changes as it will be very helpful.
On Linux, perhaps you could use an alias to execute the script with a single command; Windows has something called DOSKEY macros which are apparently similar but more limited. Another option would be a bash/batch script. In Windows, you can make a shortcut to the batch script and assign it a keystroke (e.g., ctrl+alt+p or whatever you want) by right clicking on it and modifying its properties.
Yo I've been doing python for years now, still haven't made an app with a GUI yet. Good on you, well done!
damn looks awesome
That's a great video. I have a question, how can I output text in the GUI. For example edit a text box (line edit) to display any text I want?
Two options: 1. Go to File -&gt; Print Preview, and then Save as PDF (from the print dialog; may have to set up PDF printer) 2. Go to File -&gt; "Download as" -&gt; LaTeX (.tex). Open up the .tex file you saved. They'll be a lot of header stuff that defines macros, etc. But eventually you'll find a line that says `begin{document}` and under that a `\maketitle`. Comment out the `\maketitle` part (that is change it to `% \maketitle`). Save. Compile the tex file. (E.g., run `pdflatex your_ipynb.tex`) which will generate `your_ipynb.pdf`.
Interesting. But not much on the github page on how to use it or how does it looks.
Musixmatch has the same feature called FloatingLyrics 
Great Project! I'm glad someone is putting my repo to good use. I wrote a similar script using python running on top of applescript to send me the lyrics, but I'm going to replace it with this. I thought about adding support from the Genius API, but it required each user provide Genius credentials which was a little limiting.

Yeah, sorry about that. The program gets lyrics through a Google search, so newer songs might not be up. 
1. /r/learnpython 2. This is definitely not Python 3.
Digital Ocean is really good, by the way.
Let me know if you figure it out. After it matches the fingerprint of the song, it should also know position of the matched fingerprint. I will test it if it matches the tempo also (because of dj mixes and radio stations that pitch songs up).
GUIs are a pain in the arse, but also are really satisfying when they work. 
Relatively new to python, any documentation available for how they work?
You're comparing a str to an int which is not giving the result you're expecting. You need to do this: g = int(input('Your guess: ')) You'll need to do the same thing within the loop. Once you get that working, break it by entering a non-int at the prompt and figure out how to fix it. 
I learnt personally through [Sentdex's PyQt tutorial](https://pythonprogramming.net/basic-gui-pyqt-tutorial/). It's in multiple parts and has videos to accompany it. You'll want to use [Kenwaldek's updated scripts](https://github.com/kenwaldek/pythonprogramming) that are made for PyQt5 (the most recent version of the framework) to work with and copy though, as the tutorial is made for PyQt4. After doing those, just play around with it yourself, and just Google solutions to things you want to do. 
For better or worse, I came looking for a "Prefect vs Airflow" section...

Looking good man. Keep at it 
This looks good: [https://tus.io/](https://tus.io/)
I have to tell you that since that post I spent a loooot of time with Dash and went from zero knowledge to a nice and deployed little webapp. It's a great library, not always easy but a lot of potential. Thanks to you and your colleagues.
Yes, maybe I'll do that. It's not that I need to learn that, it was just an idea to help me learn until I realised the complexity of it. Other than file conversions, do you happen to have more ideas of things I can do to help me learn? Thanks. 
Good question! Probably not, but this gives me a reason to do some performance testing.
Three options: 1. Go to File -&gt; Print Preview, and then Save as PDF (from the print dialog; may have to set up PDF printer) 2. Go to File -&gt; "Download as" -&gt; LaTeX (.tex). Open up the .tex file you saved. They'll be a lot of header stuff that defines macros, etc. But eventually you'll find a line that says `\begin{document}` and under that a `\maketitle`. Comment out the `\maketitle` part (that is change it to `% \maketitle` or just delete that line if you prefer). Save. Compile the tex file. (E.g., run `pdflatex your_ipynb.tex`) which will generate `your_ipynb.pdf` without the name of the file and date. 3. Make a custom nbconvert latex template that doesn't use `\maketitle` and compile to it. For #3 basically just write a file like `no_header.tplx`: ((* extends 'article.tplx' *)) ((* block maketitle *)) ((* endblock maketitle *)) in your local directory and then compile your document from the command line like: `jupyter nbconvert 'your_notebook.ipynb' --template no_header --to=pdf` Note this extends the `article.tplx` which should be present in a directory like `lib/python3.6/site-packages/nbconvert/templates/latex` within your virtualenv (or python directory) (which itself extends `base.tplx` which has a defined block: `((* block maketitle *))\maketitle((* endblock maketitle *))` that your new template overwrites to be blank.
Try entering this in the CMD: "py -m pip install pygame"
I've made a similar thing for Desktop, it's a GSoC project too. https://github.com/SwagLyrics/SwagLyrics-For-Spotify Pardon the name lol I thought it would be just me who's using it and not 33k other people.
I'll try this one, and will tell you the results! Thank you btw!
I am not a programmer and i really hate is when someone share code and does not explain how that works... it need an account on Twilio to work and you have to set the account data into config.ini. You are using b64decode functions, from my reading base64 encoding and decoding are public functions that anyone can evaluate. You can save those in plain text no difference.
And there is another problem, If I use markdown in Jupyter and Import any image then that image shows up in between my code instead of where I've included the image https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ekDFVSDjW-raQ5F1aGbK_mJgeWw3EDc4 All data is here, you can check this out 
why not?
Because in Python 3, `input` always returns a string, and comparisons between strings and integers always raise an exception.
Oh I didnt know that if u input a number it doesnt count as an int if u dont use int(input()) Thanks!
Can you post a video without the overzealous drummer completely drowning out your playing? I'd really love to hear the sound your guitar makes clearly, and to get a closer look at it. 
Yes, I it needs a twilio account you need to enter the twilio sid , token and number in the settings twilio tab. You need to to enter a ssl supported mail server, mail id and password in the email tab. You need to have a sqlite database containing your contacts (email and phone number) you need to select the sqlite database and enter the columns containing email id and phone numbers in the sqlite tab. Then you just need to type your message in the main window and send sms or email. I am a beginner so i am starting from simple encoding. This program still needs a lot of work like better security, multi threading and progress-bar etc and i am still working on it. Sorry if i caused you inconvenience.
1. Sry didnt know there was a specific sub for that. 2. I said that I used both trinket and python 3.7.3 but i cant really make a screenshot of python if it crashes or can I? And trinket uses python 3 but probably not the exact same version as I did cause of the different result.
Nice. Years ago, I used the USDA database for my cooking space.com web site. Back then, I found some errors in the recommended nutrition data they provide but their full ‘research’ nutrition data set worked for me.
Jupyter before converting to PDF, first writes the content to [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) (a typesetting program commonly used in academia that attempts to separate presentation from content), and then compiles the LaTeX into a PDF. LaTeX by default comes up with the formatting for you; e.g., it smartly chooses where to insert images/figures/tables in a logical way without strictly adhering to the exact order you used. Again, you can overcome this by editing the tex file yourself (e.g., [see here](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/8625/force-figure-placement-in-text)), or using option (1) which will generally be more faithful to how its displayed on your screen.
**LaTeX** LaTeX ( LAH-tekh or LAY-tekh; a shortening of Lamport TeX) is a document preparation system. When writing, the writer uses plain text as opposed to the formatted text found in WYSIWYG ("what you see is what you get") word processors like Microsoft Word, LibreOffice Writer and Apple Pages. The writer uses markup tagging conventions to define the general structure of a document (such as article, book, and letter), to stylise text throughout a document (such as bold and italics), and to add citations and cross-references. A TeX distribution such as TeX Live or MikTeX is used to produce an output file (such as PDF or DVI) suitable for printing or digital distribution. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Hello "not a programmer," I'm sure we all feel the same but some of us might have gone about stating that with a little more decency. Perhaps if you're going to offer constructive criticism you leave out the bit that you hate that it doesn't explain something that you would want, It doesn't contribute to anything. Let me give you an example: "Hey [u/destroyerrockz](https://www.reddit.com/user/destroyerrockz), Great effort here with your program. I would like to point out that it's not obvious some things are required for this program to run correctly and it might be beneficial to everyone if you included a README that lists some of the requirements for usage and such. Better yet since i'm not too busy and I noticed that it needs an account on Twilio to operate, I'll make a commitment to adding that information myself and help everyone out." And then we'll all be like "good idea u/zizzu2004, thanks for contributing" 
Do you know any good books, tutorials for pyqt5? I want to add threading and I am finding it difficult to understand from stack overflow and other people's examples. Thank you.
Thank you again! And yeah can you suggest me any tutorial/book for latex?
Looks great, keep it going!
I started working on a silly little mad lib program. Using Tkitner you enter inputs with the “Entry” variable and press a button to generate it 😂
I think I have tried this within python on the command line but not in simply command 
Googling and glancing at it this seems decent: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX (I mostly learned LaTeX from [Lamport's 1994 LaTex book](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/0201529831/) in the mid 2000s, but wouldn't recommend it today.)
This is definitely NOT Python 3. Python 3 would have crashed on this code. Try running this: `import sys; print(sys.version_info)` on Trinket. What is the output?
Thank you! 
You can create chat bots and use firebase as a database to keep user state. I’d recommend Telegram as they have a really great api and there are multiple python wrappers available for it. 
If there were an easy way around captchas, then they wouldn't used as much as they are. I would recommend contacting Microsoft and asking if there's an API you can hit. I can't imagine they don't provide some something for businesses. 
I guess its a little bit different on Trinket &amp;#x200B;
Isnt that what happened? Because I did only input and not int(input) it took a number as a string thats why it always said the number was too big.
That's what would have happened in Python 2, but not 3.
Ok I had a feeling that was going to be the answer. I'm pretty new to this so havent worked with APIs yet, are there any stand out resources you recommend to interact with them? Or should I just dive in and learn by mistakes?
[Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) But also postman application, its really great for the early stages or for poorly documented apis.
I mean, you could try to AI it up, and have it read the captchas, but I don't know how well that would work, in the end. Some AI engines are better than others, maybe google around?
Look up 'inno installer'. Assuming you have windows, you can create a windows installer with muplite files along with any files your python program needs, and it get compressed into a single exe. So here are the steps after inno is installed. 1. Go to your command line, navigate it to the python file, and freeze your code. Make sure it is not in one file (--onefile), it starts slower. 2. Go to inno and create it should automatically ask you if you want it make a new installer with the wizard. Go ahead and do so. When you get to the file selection, select your exe and, then hit add files and just select all the other files in the directory. 3. Finish the wizard. Violà! The new installer exs will appear in the same directory the original exe is in.
Oh yeah, and pyinstaller automatically creates an unins000.exe on creation, which is run by Settings when uninstalling by default. 
So because Trinket is on Python 2 it kept saying "Too big!" instead of crashing like it did for me on Python 3.7.3? Thanks for clarifying I thought it would just be an older Python 3 version because it said its python 3.
Thanks. I have added instructions in the readme.

Where did it say it was Python 3?
Do not google tkinter. It will start you down the path of "Oh, well, hello world is super easy! It's all built into python already! No add-ons!" And then hits you with "ttk? Tkinter? WTF why wont this work?!"
Huh... This is actually a pretty cool idea. Nicely done OP &amp;#x200B;
Thanks for sharing, that's great to hear! :) &amp;#x200B; Except for the part about "loooot of time" and "not always easy" of course ;) Any feedback or details you could provide would be super-appreciated: our goal is to make picking up Dash a pleasant and easy experience for everyone, and every time we fall short we try to take the feedback to heart and improve things!
If you need a front end I highly recommend turning your script into a web app aka just do a web GUI. It's super simple using e.g. Flask, and web apps are almost universally cross platform since nearly every networked device has a web browser. Not to mention you can simply install it in one place and serve it up, instead of having to install the program on each individual machine. IMO using TKinter and stuff in the current year is vastly inferior, or even the QT stuff where you have to pay (lol) if you want to use it for a business
Wow seems really functional, will take a deeper look. Thanks for making it Open :)
Of course, open source helps me help others with the same problem :) The thing I'm doing differently is directly formatting the url instead of using search to increase speed. That means some edge cases and I need to figure out how to get rid of those. There's a backend for songs that don't conform to url formatting but there's always scope for improvement.
Hey, good to see you here. Probably the next step is making the 'lyrics' a smarter object somehow (better formatting, flow during the play of the song... ). Will keep thinking on it as this got some attention, but probably the only tractable way is to find a better source. 
PyQt is amazing compared to Tkinter.
Not you, Trinket says its Python 3
Yeah at first I was poking around Pygame... this is definitely much better and more suited to my needs. Thank you!
No probs!
Lmao boy I can barely do loops 😂 Good stuff! Hoping I get to that sooner rather than later
Yeah, also there is a lot of changes between database versions that don't make much sense. 
Hey man that’s amazing. GUI is a pain in the ass, good on you for making them work. 
Or just contact Microsoft Sales and say "I have 500+ business licenses that I'd like to check for compliance"; they should be interested in verifying them because it gives them the opportunity to upsell you. That is, make them do the work for you. &amp;#x200B; In case I need to point this out, they may want to charge you for licenses that are not in compliance.
For the emails, ability to load a template of some kind, for more complex messages, or messages with HTML or images. Ability to reference query values as variables in an email, like Dear &lt;firstname&gt; &lt;lastname&gt;, How are things there in &lt;city&gt;? and so forth. The actual SQL SELECT statement could be part of the template. Then each column it references could be available to the template as a variable using some syntax like the above. 
I thought that it would be easy, but it is very time consuming. Sometimes, it had been months since I finished the Flask backend, and still haven't figured out how to make buttons go red when pressed, or share link button on FB and so on. There are just so many nonsense happening on the front end with things like React/Vue etc. etc. Even after finishing the Flask back end, the bulk of the work is; learning some front end package, coding and debugging these front end stuff and figuring out how to deploy the Python + Database on AWS/Heroku/Google App Engine.
Yeah that would be the easy way wouldnt it... These are all being rounded up for resale and we just need the specs, and in all reality I was looking at it as a learning opprtunity. Like I said earlier I'm pretty new to coding and am trying to use it wherever I can for practice. I dont need the report made for another couple of weeks, so I didnt mind spending a few hours learning if it pays off later.
Like some special notations when referencing a sql column? For eg:- I can write &lt;col-colname&gt; or something and it will substitute it with values from the db column. Thanks, I will look into it.
Thanks, I'm reading up on it now! 
How are you sending SMS’s? Do you have a SIM card in your PC?
I am using twilio. It is web api that helps you send sms from a computer.
Ahh I know Twilio, great that you’re using them, they have a really comprehensive API!
Yes, but I read an article where someone needed to code an application that would be used on seriously underpowered hardware, and tkinter is extremely lightweight, so I guess it depends on your usage.
It's not the size of your Python that matters. 
I can always appreciate a good GUI work in python. Loved making them myself.
I made a template for nbconvert to maintain the look for Jupiter notebook at much as possible in the conversion to PDF. You can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/t-makaro/nb_pdf_template).
What gui framework do you use?
Fluent Python would be my first recommendation.
It has been quite some time so I'm not gonna lie I dont remember much. I believe TkInter is the name of the library I used.
Looks like it is mentioned in a github issue: [https://github.com/modin-project/modin/issues/515](https://github.com/modin-project/modin/issues/515) &amp;#x200B; Seems like they are different from Dask DataFrame in that they can run different backends (it says they have a Dask backend as well). Maybe more of a general DataFrame framework than Dask
Ok, Thanks.
good job my friend. have fun and keep it going!
Define "scaling". For large apps, 90% of speed is correct choice of algorithm, 90% of the rest is correct choice of data storage. For that matter, if the network is involved that will probably be your bottleneck anyway, unless you have massive data quantities or unusually high processing requirements.
Now I never made anything nearly as complex as you did and I know next to damn nothing about efficient python programming, but it was still fun to work with. I remember making the framework of a GUI for a former professor of mine that he was hoping to use for his research but that path fell through.
Depends on your goals ... I wanted to be able to put it in PyCharm and just press 'Run'. Works flawless.
AutoHotKey is essentially a portable app so you don't need to "install" it, just copy it to a folder and run your AHK file. &amp;#x200B;
I can give you some feedback. Firstly, I'm used to matplotlib, so two things come out of that: - I have to adapt to the Plotly way of things, which of course takes a bit of time. - I'm eager to do many new things that I couldn't do with matplotlib, to the point that I want to do things which are not easy either to do with Plotly. Basically, I got excited by Plotly capabilities, and sometimes reached the limits where I was not expecting them, like this vertical hover bar I mentioned earlier. On that point, Plotly being less popular than Matplotlib, you don't get the same success rate when googling an issue. Secondly, and this not Dash' fault, it takes some time to get around Flask! My usual tools are Pandas and Pyspark, web-dev in Python is not so natural for me. I'm not good at normal HTML but html in Python is just so weird... And the callback method took also some time to correctly understand. By the way, coming back to the first part: once I understood callback, I wanted to do many things for which there was no input detection I could find, like callback on zoom for instance. On the plus side, I was pretty amazed by how fast and easy it is to deploy, especially since I did that in a pretty restrictive work environnement, only using Anaconda. Of course there are many more things to say on the plus side, but you know the strengths of Plotly when compared to Matplotlib. 
well, i am also not a efficient python programmer myself. This program is a written by reading codes from qtdocs, stackoverflow and programcreek. I can't seem to find a book on pyqt5.
I create a lot of automation scripts in the MS world using Powershell. Most scripts aren't that complicated, not all that long, but when I started to create a script to fill out my time sheet. Oh boy was that a wild ride into trying to create a library. I found a python library that did most of what I needed. Now I have a nice script that runs every Friday, adds up my time and fills out my time sheet with my meetings and my unallocated time. All I have to do is hit one button when I leave at the end of the week. I started playing with python only a month ago. Keep learning and improving!
You can also pay for that, 2 $ for 5000 captcha solve. It's work well, but when you know that is people in poor country do it for you, I don't no if it's ethic or correct to use this kind of services. But I'm digress from the subject... You can't avoid it, you have right, contacting Microsoft is the best solution. But depending on the kind of captcha you are facing, you can find library that will solve it for you 
This is why we have the web
This is pretty much what I did when applying for jobs except with word and Excel as input documents into a python script. Even the triangle brackets actually. Main reason being that I was sending out CV's and cover letters and forgot to change the name once or twice which was embarrassing, so this prevented that. If I were to do it again I'd have it raise an error if there was a word in triangle brackets but no match to a reference column. Fortunately, it never sent something out that was wrong but I was paranoid it would and just kind of fingers crossed it.
Thanks for this tuto, it's under CC licence, it's not advertisement as nothing is given to make you buy. It's only a pure share of knowledge.

So what do you recommend? pyqt?
Start with PySimpleGUI then move to pyqt5
seems legit and awesome good work !!
As I keep telling my CS cohorts: 1. Find a problem 2. Break it into smaller problems 3. Keep breaking those problems into smaller problems until... you can find a tutorial easy enough that you can follow along and solve the sub-problem. 4. Piece together all your sub-problem solutions to build larger solutions 5. Have the solution to your original problem To become rich: 1. Find a problem that other's have 1. Do the above 7. Sell the solution 8. Profit Working on the becoming rich part. 
I really struggle keeping my code clean and sane. With GUI everything goes wrong in every way and I can't do anything with that.
Sometimes it crashes with no errors or whatsoever. Love it. You have to roll back to see what possibly went wrong.
There is an import cost when using pyqt, but after that it is very fast. For programs that spend most of their time running (and not starting up), it is a good choice even on low end systems. For a program that just needs to display OK/Cancel, it is terrible.
Just a reminder that threading in pyqt5 is still single processor. It doesn't escape Python's GIL magically. 
Cool man, are you studyng python for how long? 
Use a CLI, save yourself
I’ll check this out too. Thanks!
I do plan on learning web (someday...). I’m assuming CLI is command line interface?
use pyside2, not pyqt5. qt5 ported to python, but better licensing terms
Just do it. Stop worrying about what way is best, and just learn the basics followed by a project that excites you.
Can confirm, stuff that used to be trivial in CSS/Javascript takes me for ever in python ( not bitching though) , currently redoing a demo from pygame to Kivy and its sloooow going.
Awesome
ok
Ah good to know! You do not have to be sorry! Your script is gold anyways. The lyrics will be online sooner or later so I just have to wait :) 
«When those come out, buy *"bitcoins"*.»
Nice man. Great job 
4 months i think. I started seriously around December last year.
Nice, iam on my first mounth 
what are it's advantages over pyqt5?
Well, I am thinking of learning flask or django while working on this project. 
I can't say for sure, we are being taught to avoid hard coding. I'm not sure if that's normal practice though
are you using video courses or book?
Hopefully OP is using a module like `appdirs`, that provides a portable interface for this sort of thing.
For now video courses

Might be better to use a template library like jinja2: http://jinja.pocoo.org. 
Very cool idea! I tried to use the instance you provided, and it's not accepting my credentials; I tried my email addy, my userid, and the id I've been using to login "devices". Any ideas? My account was started on Fb, but then I converted it to a password account. (I know this isn't a tech support forum, so feel free to ignore me).
Hey man, no problem, up to help. So just to be sure, you're giving the bot the exact same email and password you're using to successfully log in from the web version, and it's not working? Maybe the first log in process got stuck. Try using /cancel and trying again with /start? Nothing else coming out of my mind right now. 
You’re correct I was being a bit tongue in cheek too, Argparse is much easier to work with and having a CL tool is more impressive to non-technicals
Learn unit-testing early. Use a debugger often. It took years and some electroshock therapy to get out of the habit of, print(sys.exc_info()[0]) at every exception.
I think this belongs to /r/learnpython I do not really understand the problem, to be honest. What is the key between the two files? You should read both files and create a dict of dict of lists which has the city as key in the first dict, the prod_id in the inner dict, and every line containing city and prod_id gets appended to the list. Then you can iterate over cities and products to sum. Does that help?
Looks interesting. Thanks 
Here are my nitpicks: * Consider replacing `print(...)` with `print(..., file=sys.stderr)`. * How you calculate `field_count` is neat, but it could probably do with an explanation on what it does and why it's there for future maintainers. You could add a comment or try to make your code more self-documenting * The calculation of `field_count` also does more than it needs to: if `tup[1]` is `None`, the rest of the values will also be `None`. * If you try to have a `print_msg` that has the value multiple times, like `'blah blah {0:f} (in hex: {0:x})'` (contrived example, I know), then it doesn't work as expected. I suggest checking for `field_count == 0` instead. * The control flow is odd. Instead of `_strict_format`, I would have a function `is_format_string` like this: def is_format_string(message): fragments = string.Formatter().parse(message) return any(field_name is not None for (literal_text, field_name, format_spec, conversion) in fragments) ... and then use it like if is_format_string(self.print_msg): print(self.print_msg.format(self.run_time), file=sys.stdout) else: print(self.print_msg, self.run_time, file=sys.stdout) This has the advantage of not looking like something goes wrong in a code path where nothing has actually gone wrong, while also being clearer about what's happening and why. (In general, catching an exception your own code is a code smell.)
Good ones! I spotted the \`ls &lt;glob&gt;\`, which is a common mistake but since he seemed to want it in reverse sort I left it alone.
I highly recommend it. That book has so many exercises that are actually useful, instead of just toy exercises. It helped me automate processes in my job. It's definitely a good starting point since you'll being to see how Python is so useful. Ramides posted a link to the book's website. Check it out!
It sounds like you would be better off using a database. If you have to user python, you could always read the csv's into an in memory sqlite dB and then do a query to get the results in the shape you want and write it back out to a CSV.
If you're inserting fields into the text, it might be worth having a PREVIEW function to review the messages before you send them. The biggest complaint people have about personalised marketing is when they get "Dear &lt;firstname," because someone forgot to close out the tag properly. That said, why have you chosen to do this with a GUI and not through an SMS gateway with a web interface? Something about not wanting to upload private contact lists, or having them change too often for it to be practical?
This belongs to /r/learnpython instead. You should look at `requests` and `beautifulsoup` to scrap the webpage. Whether that works depends on the amount of java script and flash within the game.
I took the easy way out....
Youtubers like sentdex , corey, pretty printed are such a blessing for newcomers! 
The general approach for requirements is having a 'requirements.txt' file with each package separated by line, with optional version mentioning. For more info: [https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user\_guide/#requirements-files](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files) In your case, keeping things simple, adding a simple requirements.txt file with just the package names (separated by newlines) will allow people to run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' and get the appropriate packages.
Yeah that's cool, I use pycharms environment external tools that you can configure to run before whatever

Every single person posting here knew less about python at one point than you know now. Every single person. So don't be discouraged at all, you're doing fine. There's so much to learn and that's what makes it so much fun. 
What I want to know, is how can I send free SMS from anywhere in the world. (Since this is what this app does)
You can likely get your own, unfortunately I doubt there would be an API but you may be able to scrape that data. It's pretty unlikely you'll be able to get others data for privacy reasons, but I don't know for sure, so don't quote me. But, this should be posted to /r/learnpython instead of here.
I am just curious : what are some examples of "choice of algorithm" you had to implement ? For us a lot of time, it ends up being finding the library that does it fully or provide helpers.
Frankly when u get used to the command line, u find its better in almost every conceivable way.

Every time I’ve wanted to use pdb I’m stuck in some huge framework that makes it nearly impossible. Every other time I haven’t had a real need. Unit tests on the other hand.. “it’s just a python script” that becomes a project that’s crucial to everything my team does.. that didn’t have unit tests until _way too late_. Seriously though, unit tests makes writing new features and bug fixes a ton easier to test in general, as well as providing some “oh that’s how that works” out of the box.
The main advantage? Official support

I'm a big fan of [Effective Python][1] for learning idiomatic Python. It has some good sections on concurrency and the limitations of threads in Python. That info on concurrency is before asyncio came out (3.5+), but still pretty helpful. [1]: https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Python-Specific-Software-Development/dp/0134034287 As far as data driven concerns, I really recommend checking out [Designing Data Intensive Applications][2]. Its a language/solution neutral survey of most of the popular solutions and patterns for processing and storing data (relational stores, columnar stores, kafka, all that good stuff). It gives a great overview of the low level details and tradeoffs of each solution. [2]: https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321 Python can certainly scale if you're setting up your servers properly, but its main benefit is in being flexible! Good luck!
No database needed; I am using a short file for test on my computer, but the requirement states that it should be executable from a github account - I am not very familiar with this last point but would like to learn.
You should survey presentions from the PyCOn and PyData conferences. [https://pyvideo.org/search.html?q=kafka](https://pyvideo.org/search.html?q=kafka) [https://pyvideo.org/search.html?q=spark](https://pyvideo.org/search.html?q=spark)

Everyone is global. Wish I still had the time to frag :(
And that makes it look like birch trees, isn't that sneaky? Heh. Ha. It's gorgeous.
I have no clue how to do that so well done.
And that stuff is useful knowledge with real world application while the alternatives are unmarketable skills with poor results and better alternatives. If you're trying to make a desktop app or something with a GUI, Python is not the language that would be best choice.

My high school coding teacher switched all of his computers for Raspberry Pi’s when I was there for my senior year. I ended up taking CP1, CP2, and CP3 all over again just so I could sit in his class for three periods and play around with python.

Maybe it’s time to finally get back to working on my terrible dungeon crawler named JibJab, it got corrupted last time I remember :(

I'm in this situation now, just started a new job that's basically excel, outlook, and a database. I've already found a ton of things just using excel (just starting to learn python now) to speed things up, but I'm cautious about showing it all, as I'd rather be seen as a worker who does a lot of work rather than shrinking the workload.

I wouldn't show any of it. Use the automation to take care of what you can right now quickly, then use your extra time to do even more stuff. Idk that's what I'd do. If they ever think about everything you do, they might be impressed and give you a raise. You let them know that they hired you for stuff that can be largely automated, they will think less of you.
There is a website that visualizes the process cant link it right now though. Also sorry for late reply.

I had one just yesterday, actually. Pretty simple, but illustrates that it isn't just a matter for "library stuff" (like sorting/searching algorithms). My algorithm was: for each larger category: get items in the category, if any for each item: see if item mismatches category (This is obviously very simplified.) The trouble is, the "get any items in the category" step turns out to be very slow, which I didn't realize when I threw it together. And I'm doing it needlessly, since most categories have no items. What I should really do is: get all items, grouped by category for each category group and items in it: see if item mismatches category Now I'm never fetching "items in a category", which was the slow part. Put another way: The original algorithm was doing a query for each of several thousand categories, most of which came up empty. The new algorithm does one query to get just the stuff I need in one shot. I haven't timed the new one yet, but it should be on the order of a few seconds, while the old one is on the order of minutes. That's 2 orders of magnitude improvement just from choosing the right algorithm.

Hello, it's you from the past. Appreciate the advice! But I could really use some in depth tutorials especially about the theory of python that explain things like how range works, for example
Love where you're going with the Jupiter support. Is there a place for feature requests? A couple that come to mind are: 1. Run all cells 2. Add a space after each cell in the editing doc. Would Helo with readability. Would love to know what's on the roadmap. Thanks for the awesome product!
Would you mind adding a license file to your repo so I know how I'm allowed to use it?
Additionally, it directly formats the url to scrape instead of using search to improve speed. That means there are a few edge cases that don't conform but I'm trying to work on that. The project is featured in Google Summer of Code so that's a plus, I'm hoping solid work gets done over the summer :)
This is really nice! I'm gonna give it a try :)
nice work ive never made a GUI in Python bc its slow af and my computers already a lil slow use c# or c++ or java python is great but not for performance tasks 
Thanks!

"All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind." - Bob Ross
The best thing you can do when doing gui work is to use MVC or something similar that splits up the GUI from the program logic. it's not that hard to debug if you put in proper try...except conditions in critical places. Learn to use queues if you pass information between threads. isolation of function is the key on large apps and especially GUIs.
If you're using something that isn't embedded and you have reasonable space on the target systems, then pyqt is going to be a lot easier to program in, and have a HUGE library of available features. If you just want a quick small GUI though, tkinter might be an easier path. For general development I would recommend PyQt though. 
You really should look into gitlab or github if you are doing any coding at all. Even a simple 'never branch" devlopment allows you revision your software and never lose it since it's in the cloud.
I really like flask, but django just seems like a much bigger pill to swallow. Flask you can pick up in parts haha. 
thanks anyway :)
tbh (and i dont mean to be a debbie downer) i dont know if ive made a big blunder due to dynamic typing. im a dynamic native for full disclosure but i find static typing to be a lot of hype (i even think there is a study). im down with the type hints in python but i use them more like comments or docs. 
Just follow PEP8: [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) Also [http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html](http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) Ok so this is what I see in a lot of applicants from schools whom have never written a line of professional code (which is okay!) but big downfalls/mistakes &amp;#x200B; 1. Non sense variable and method/function names. ESPECIALLY IN PYTHON. KEEP IT PYTHONIC 2. unnecessary variables. Especially python, use the python tools..i.e. dictionaries, lists, list comprehension, list goes on 3. spaghetti code. No giant monolithic functions please. It's a bitch to debug/glance at 4. LACK OF CONSISTENCY &amp;#x200B; Honestly just follow the above (either or) and you'll address pretty much all style conundrums.

Awesome interface. The last time I touched Python I was trying to develop a Tkinter app but gave it up to learn C#. Now that I understand GUI design frameworks, I want to try my python applications again. Based on the comments, I'm guessing QT was used for this?

Hello We all study any Courses so that we can utilize the knowledge and skills in the form of job. We try our best to get placed at a good company through which we are able to utilize our skills. Some people dream of making something new with their skills but still it required some years of experience for that . So it is very much important to crack the Job interview . Similar is with the programming language Python . Some of us [Pursue Diploma in Python Certification](http://pythonandmltrainingcourses.com/courses/best-diploma-in-python-course-in-delhi/) or few months Python Courses so that we can get a good job and do something big in life. Some of the frequently asked Interview question for Python are : * Difference between list and tuple. * How is Python Interpreted . * Picking and unpicking. * What are the Parameters which you like in Python as compared to other programming language. * Which python library you like the most.
Exceptionally useful for aggregating and doing numerical analysis on stocks, some packages like Pandas are really great at timeseries. I used to work at [YCharts.com](https://YCharts.com) (almost all of the entire backend is Python, ie. calculations like P/E ratio, growth, etc).
Ah I just assumed you built it for your job! You'd be surprised how much home-brewed software is used in the education sector, often because historically the price of enterprise software was prohibitive. (I mean, prohibitive for Marketing...

It's the venomous liquid that you can squirt out.
I got hit with a pretty major bug with python automatically changing a set to a frozen set when I returned it from a particular function/after doing something to it. That took a while to trace back to why everything was suddenly becoming immutable. &amp;#x200B; I've also been hit with things that were my fault, but would have been easily caught in a statically typed language. Things such as forgetting what type a particular list held and appending the wrong type etc. somewhere deep in the code... &amp;#x200B; Another thing that I actually came to dislike about Python was the dynamic addition to objects! So if I had [Object.name](https://Object.name) and then one time accidentally typed [Object.Name](https://Object.Name) suddenly I had a new attribute rather than an error. I ended up actually writing a little script that would disable the attribute addition (until I found out about setting \_\_slots to limit it). &amp;#x200B; I did use mypy quite extensively and found it quite helpful. I think it'd be nice to have a FOSS language that has python esq. syntax that is statically typed though.

Playing with PIL. I have three directories of images, vintage advertisements, vintage text images, my own camera photos. I want to get a random image from each directory. Turning one into a mask. Then using it to mask the other two when overlaid. Then post on Twitter as a bot. Using snippets/lines of code as the status text. Then doing a YouTube video about it. 
Large projects that have to be maintened over long period of time are very hard to get right without static typing. It's a pure nightmare to refactor a big code base without type annotations. I think the same can be said for assertions and design-by-contract.
Sorry, I had to delete it went I left the company. They went out of business before shipping the product ... and so this is all I have left. I thought it'd be inspiring, though, to see what can be done with Python.

"Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be." - Bob Ross
I think the one that hits people the most is unexpected `None`s. Several modern languages don't normally allow the lack of a value in a variable unless it is explicitly defined as such, and the variable is a sum / optional / maybe type that needs disambiguating before use. In these cases, the type system acts to ensure that if you have a variable, it definitely has a value. And if it's an optional type that could potentially not have a value, the type system forces you to disambiguate it by switching / unwrapping. The end result is that there is never any doubt as to whether you could potentially have `None` in your variable or not. If it's a possibility, you're forced to deal with it so that you can access the value. If you're comparing Python's dynamic typing to C-style languages that can stick `NULL` anywhere they like, then it's not an obvious win for static typing. But if you're comparing it to something like Swift, it's a lot more obvious just how many bugs you can avoid this way. 
and i think print() was only in python 3 so i would also bet on an old python 3 version

I don’t have this issue. Are you not using a SSD?
It is an NVM SSD, literally the best you can get. I ran pytest with -collectonly flag and it still got stuck for exact amount of time. I think collecting is also quite slow since I have around 3000 unit tests and it takes around a minute to load them up after the initial "hanging" behavior. I think it is something pre-collect.
It definitely looks very good and very native-like!
Thanks! wxPython made it really easy to do that. You wouldn't know it was written in Python -- it ran great on Windows and Linux.
Did you write it by hand or used a GUI designer?
Don't do shitty string matching. Use Sentry! FWIW, you could also let Python's logging module send you an email for log entries of a certain severity (e.g. warning or error), but Sentry is much nicer.
Completely by hand. I created smaller widgets (like the snapshot bar on the bottom) that I combined into bigger ones.
Check that your packages are early on your path. That's the biggest simple impact on startup time that I know of. I assume your Linux &amp; Mac boxes have similar specs. Is that right?
Yes, you can create a free acoount in twilio to use it.
Yes. I measured basic stuff like ALU operations simply running addition of 1 billion numbers, and they look similar in speed

Best thing is neither Python nor Anaconda are venomous. 
Same version of Python I assume? Sure sounds like a path issue.
Which variable should I be looking at for ? PATH and PYTHONPATH?
I'm probably misunderstanding something, but why not just loop form 0th to length - 3 (third form the end)th element, while adding a comma? Then you add second to last element, add &amp;, then add the last element.

Also r/learnpython
Sweet!
Oh, oops, brainfart, I meant to use `stderr` instead of `stdout`.
No huge errors because of good tests, but the typing does make development of large programs quicker. Not using mypy since jetbrains includes a type checker in Pycharm that's about an order of magnitude quicker.
&gt; I think it'd be nice to have a FOSS language that has python esq. syntax that is statically typed though. https://nim-lang.org/

Where is PyQQt Designer? Is it bundled with PyQt?
Python will do everything Excel does and much, much more. Far too many to list exhaustively. It's a programming language. If your computer can do it, Python can make your computer do it. I'm currently writing a (non-finance) program that takes orbital descriptions of satellites, displays a segment of them as seen from a particular site, instructs a radar to take observations of the satellite, then show those observations on top of the prediction. In addition to all the science-y stuff, Python is helping me move files around, store results in a DB and providing a GUI. This was all done on Thursday and Friday.

I’ve only seen individually addressable lights on gaming laptops and even then on quite a few. It would definitely make for a cool effect, given you can also change the color too
I wanted to learn how IRC worked and learn a bit of python, and the project grew and grew as I slowly gained understanding of both.

I have not much experience with python cuz I just starded a few months ago, but I see no reason to choose 2 over 3
The End Of Life date for Python 2 is in 2020. There will be no official support after that. You should definitely choose Python 3.
Given Python 2 reached its end of life on Jan 1st 2020 so will no longer be maintained, there is only one sensible answer to your question.
I mostly use 2 because it is still the basis for ArcGIS, a mapping program I use at work. QGIS, another mapping program, has switched to 3, so I've started to work with that. Also, 2 is still the default in Fedora and CentOS, the Linux distros I use. They have 3 available, but I've been using 2 for about fifteen years, so it's what I continue to use.

Python 3. The previous arguments for 2 (module support/compatibility, continued support, etc.) don’t apply any more.
One reason would be a legacy project, where most of the project is written on python2 and it would take a lot of time and effort to rewrite everything nearly from scratch. Another reason is legacy dependancies, which are used and heavily relied on in the project.
Here’s a similar project for Mac OS: https://github.com/pirate/mac-keyboard-brightness/blob/master/README.md

**Betteridge's law of headlines** Betteridge's law of headlines is an adage that states: "Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no." It is named after Ian Betteridge, a British technology journalist who wrote about it in 2009, although the principle is much older. As with similar "laws" (e.g., Murphy's law), it is intended to be humorous rather than the literal truth.The maxim has been cited by other names since as early as 1991, when a published compilation of Murphy's Law variants called it "Davis's law", a name that also crops up online, without any explanation of who Davis was. It has also been referred to as the "journalistic principle", and in 2007 was referred to in commentary as "an old truism among journalists". *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

One thing I found; in the function that grabs the password from the chat, it runs .lower() on the string... my password has upper case letters :-) user\_pass = update.message.text.lower() &amp;#x200B; Taking that out did it :-)
In general, if you don't have a specific reason to use an older version, use the newest. Unless it's Java, then just don't use it.

Ok
PyQt5
It is bundled with pyqt5-tools. It's in C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\Lib\site-packages\PyQt5
The game (along with the source code) is available here: [https://cmlsc.itch.io/super-potato-bruh](https://cmlsc.itch.io/super-potato-bruh) &amp;#x200B; Super Potato Bruh is my indie gamedev project made using Python and Pygame. The initial release was made in around 100 hours. This update (which adds a whole new world) took another 15ish hours to make. It's a Super Meat Boy-like with bullet hell elements thrown in. &amp;#x200B; If you have any questions, feel free to ask! \\o/
Why did these programs not get updated to python 3 in TEN years?
Wow, this looks really good.
(1) Both. Or none in that *easy* conrext. (2) web means that user isn't forced to use preconfigured/preinstalled computer for the job. (3) development for that may be easier on Qt (4) no questionat all, so just remark that the name is Postgres or PostgresSQL (5) dunno, but there are some. 100%. (6) CSS and Javascript, when you familiarize yourself with them you'll pick some framework to research, Bootstrap for start, maybe VueJS or Angular...
Thanks! :D

If you want a desktop application, use Qt. If you want a web application, use a Web Gui. You can run web application locally and open a browser with minimal features, so that your application will look like a desktop app. "Web Gui" for python app is normally created using html/css/javascript or javascript Gui frameworks. It interacts with services that are written in python. If you need to go beyond basic drawing on canvas and D3.js does what you want, use D3.js in Web Gui.
Just let tkinter die. Use pyside2
Looks really good! I’ll give it a try

The version of Python is low on the list of things that should have been upgraded by now... ArcDesktop is still a 32-bit, single-processed Windows program. Their new program, ArcGIS Pro, is 64-bit, multiprocessed, with Python 3, but it still lacks quite a few features of the old program.

When falling behind on a rerun for best score, do the game tell the player to [ketchup](https://i.imgur.com/yxyAkUQ.gif)?!
The levels aren't timed. It doesn't matter how long it takes to beat a level. The main reason for this is that the game was designed in a way to make you keep moving (your best times would likely only be separated by a fraction of a second if I timed levels).
I understand that this is not something what you would do as a top priority, but it has been ten years. And the longer you wait, especially in the IT business, the more you fall behind compared to others
Man... this is co cool! Just got it so I can take a look at the source code later. BTW lol @ "Princess Lechuga". Well done!
Hmm, seems to crash on start then. One thing you can try is to search for files \`reddit\_state\` and \`twitter\_state\`, delete those and then try opening the app again.

Hello everyone, I just received a prompt from Apple to install security update of march 29th. I randomly ran my tests expecting same behavior but now verything is INSTANT. Blazingly fast.

Tkinter is all that is available at work for me. It makes everything look like win 95.

Does the potato get power ups to become a Super Spud?
How would the tool determine the field type?
Hey /dafluffpotato, my steam version is still dead as a doo-doo. 
Read the column names and/or types (e.g., with `pandas` or `csv` package), and then write something that prints out the definition. E.g., if they are all integers: for col_name in col_names: print("%s = models.IntegerField("%s")" % (col_name.lower().replace(' ','_'), col_name)) and then copy that into your models.py in the appropriate field. Again, may have to think out your model and how to detect whether to have CharField, ForeignKey, IntegerField, FloatField, etc, and how to detect their properties (`max_length` from say looking at the CSV data, blank=True, null=True if you have nulls, etc.).
Check out this thread for a similar question: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b2ljwb/comment/ej1947l
Dead as in not working or dead as in no update? The update won't be out on Steam for a bit because I'm figuring stuff out, but the Steam version itself should at least work.
Hey senpai, can you teach us more how to do these? We've lots to learn from you.
No. xD
Thank you! :D
It is. A Steam key comes with the game if you buy it on itch.io and you only get the source if you buy it on itch.io (because I can't make the source downloadable on Steam), so I recommend buying it there even if you want to play on Steam.
Dead as not working, I expected it won't get updated as quickly. The downloaded (older) version worked, so it's probably some Steam issue. So I checked the Steam debug and it looks like it was build against different glibc, `Bruh/Super Potato Bruh: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version ` `GLIBC_2.25' not found (required by /tmp/_MEIfJ7fwj/libexpat.so.1)` 
It could be that the Linux version is broken then. I'll take a look.
I have tons of free open source projects that were made in game jams: https://cmlsc.itch.io/ I really recommend game jams if you want to learn. They make you work efficiently, give you an idea of where you're doing well/poorly, and they make you *actually finish a project*. :P
I often try to help people with indie Linux ports, if you have the time you can PM me and I can give you my e-mail address. You can use me as your live debugger.
That is where zmq will help. They have existing patterns of asynchronous and concurrent communication you can try out, or you can roll your own. Check it out if for no other reason than to see how they made their abstraction over TCP and UDP.
ESRI isn't known for their progression of current versions. They tend to be a "rewrite it all and promise some day you'll be able to do what you already can do but better" company. Then, they get way too caught up on the new-and-shiny and don't fix what people need for day-to-day work. Anything flashy is what they work the most on.
Based on that error, it's not a crash from my code. It's something related to the compiler or your version of Linux. Seems like it's some sort of dependency issue.
You could use Django or Jinja2 templates to render a model definition in a python file, e.g. {% for col_name in col_names %} {{ col_name }} = models.CharField(max_length=200) {% endfor %} If you use Jinja2 and want to avoid extra blank lines, you should look into [line statements](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/templates/#line-statements): # for col_name in col_names {{ col_name }} = models.CharField(max_length=200) # endfor
Yes, it's not code issue, it's compilation issue. Your binary is linked against glibc on your system. There's probably some Steam centric song and dance to get it working. 
I was cleaning up the directory and unnecessary files before pushing the code for an initial commit. I should have done it sooner haha
Alright, so it's working on Ubuntu for me. What distro of Linux are you using? Also, did you try some of the fixes that come up when you google the error?

Looks fantastic and extremely smooth too for a python game. Just curious, how many copies have you sold so far? 
Great job.
You've got it mixed up buddy, the original one does work flawlessly. The one that is linked here with the broken images is the "stolen" one.
Are you unable to update it to 2.25 for some reason? Or is that just what comes with Debian?
Love the game. For things in life I can’t explain in my Mac I had to install Ubuntu and I could finally play the game. Marvelous I loved it. Great Job. One happy customer here.
Very nice, but needs a mod to change the graphics and turn it into a"Pickel Rick" game. I never expected Python to do this well at video games.
Wow. A bullet-hell platformer is such a brilliant idea, and your execution looks stellar.
Almost 400 at full price. If you add purchases from things like bundles and sales, it makes the numbers kind of useless since the prices are all over the place (especially with the bundle from last year).
Here is one [https://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/api.php#phase](https://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/api.php#phase)
You don't upgrade glibc, it's a base library that is used by entire system. You only get never version with a new release. I'm guessing you've build your binary on a current Ubuntu and this gives you something linked against "too new" glibc. The quickest way to fix it is to build it on some older Linux release that have older glibc.
That's great to hear! I'm still frustrated that I don't have a way to port to Mac though. Pyinstaller is the only one that does it and for whatever reason running the executable runs from a completely different directory than the one the game is actually in, so it can't find its assets. Couldn't seem to find a way to fix it. (I don't use Macs either, so trying to even get it to compile in the first place was a pain.)
Thanks! I don't know why, but I *really* like mixing bullet hells with other genres. I even attempted to make a [bullet hell, platformer, card game](https://cmlsc.itch.io/quickdraw-tcg) although I didn't get enough projectiles to call it a "bullet hell".
MVC, split up your logic, main consideration is split up core logic, the view (presentation to the user) and control portions of an app. Here is a decent example https://www.giacomodebidda.com/mvc-pattern-in-python-introduction-and-basicmodel/ . If you are wondering about try...except then I'm just talking about putting them around the "suspect" code and trying to catch the failure then just keep cutting the size in half until you catch the culprit. In addition it's just good to use them often in parts of code that you suspect can raise exceptions (file loads, calculations, accessing resources external to your program, etc). As far as threading, I'm guess that you probably aren't doing that yet if you haven't encountered MVC yet. However in my experience queues are &gt;&gt;&gt; than mutexing (and sharing data) when using threads unless you absolutely need the performance gain of shared memory resources. 
Ah OK. Props to Mokhtar then, none to Brooke.
Oh, ok then. I'll see what I can do, but I don't think I can fix it for a bit.
Codingame Code Clash
Interesting! Did not know this existed. Small difference with my proposal: I'm looking for a game on how to get better at using your IDE (Pycharm, Vim, Visual Studio Code)
i won't be able to help, but that sounds like hell out of projects. can you share more technical details?
I actually tried gspread first and didn't get anywhere with it I forgot what I got hung up on. Know of a tutorial that is current?
I got up and running just with the [gspread docs](https://gspread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
Dude, nice work! How long did it take you to make it? 
I like the Super Meat Boy name ;)
I'd use VTK. It's optimized for user interaction vs. making gorgeous renders. It'll still pretty, but lighting and shadows aren't the focus. I use it for developing an FEA/CFD renderer that supports a large number of results (e.g., fringe, displacements, vectors) and is responsive to mouse input. Just change the user interaction.
How would you check the "correct" block?
There will be a Pygame 2? O_O A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one. 
Any block is correct because all of the nodes are adding data blocks to the chain.
Oh ok, I cannot help you but I'm interested in the topic. Good luck finding answers :)
About 100 hours for the original game. (Up to world 5.)
It may be overkill for your application, but there are freely available, high performance tools for large scientific data sets in formats such as HDF5.
It is called a Merkel tree. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree That should put you on the right path.

**Merkle tree** In cryptography and computer science, a hash tree or Merkle tree is a tree in which every leaf node is labelled with the hash of a data block, and every non-leaf node is labelled with the cryptographic hash of the labels of its child nodes. Hash trees allow efficient and secure verification of the contents of large data structures. Hash trees are a generalization of hash lists and hash chains. Demonstrating that a leaf node is a part of a given binary hash tree requires computing a number of hashes proportional to the logarithm of the number of leaf nodes of the tree; this contrasts with hash lists, where the number is proportional to the number of leaf nodes itself. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
It's possible to have both in a single GUI API if you use [PySimpleGUI](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org). A new video was posted this week that explains how this works: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b6i78x/tutorial\_multiplegui\_package\_portability\_video/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b6i78x/tutorial_multiplegui_package_portability_video/) You can write your GUI code *once*, run it on multiple underlying GUI platforms (tkinter, QT, WxPython and Web / Remi) without changing your code. You hint around at your app's capabilities but I don't get a sense of the overall size / scope of what you're doing. Is it a large project? Or a series of smaller ones?
Wow, that’s impressive, congratulations! I’m just starting to learn Python, so I hope to reach your level soon!
This looks super challenging lol. But well done!
Thanks for reply, you deserve every sale
Why aren’t they in the same virtual environment??
I hope this isn't a stupid question to ask as I have always been interested in creating a game and I am very new to Python, but did you create all of the art assets or how did you come about obtaining them? I just assume everyone who puts out these indie projects can also do art! lol. 
The difficulty is parsing the ingredients, matching that parsed input with something in the USDA database, and converting between volume and weight in the recipes. 
As /u/cyanydeez said, the best thing to do when you don't understand what is going on, is to write some tests. Writing tests will 1) Help you understand the code 2) Help you write testable code, which is more maintainable code 3) Make sure your code keeps working. For point #2, you have a bit of a problem testing, since the formatting code is buried in code that does a lot of other things. Add a function def format(self, value): return str("-"*int(11-int(len(str(value)))/2-1))+str(value)+str("-"*int(11-int(len(str(value)))/2-1))+"|" then in cards, just do shields = self.format(self.shields) then you can create a ship, and just do something like assert(len(s.format(s.shields)) == 11) This should always be true, *if the function works*. Otherwise it will throw an AssertionError, which it does. So, we know there's an error, but there's still a big, ugly line that has an error in it. Let's break it down more, for better testing. Let's take the function out that generates the padding. def pad(self, value): return int(11-int(len(str(value)))/2-1) def format(self, value): return str("-"*self.pad(value))+str(value)+str("-"*int(self.pad(value))+"|" Now, right away we can see an issue. The code for the left pad and the right pad is exactly the same. So there's no way this can have "4 '-' on the left and 5 '-' on the right." So, that's one bug to fix. This will only work for odd numbered lengths. For now, let's try 3 characters, 123. 11-3 is 8, over two is four. So we should get 4 on from pad(). Hmm. That fails, we get 8. That's twice what it should be. That gives me enough to see that the padding should be (11-len(s.shields))/2, not 11 - len(s.shields)/2 Also, len() returns an int, so we have an extra int(). pad should be def pad(self, value): return int((11-len(str(value)))/2) The -1 isn't needed, I don't believe. You can add some more test cases to be sure. You'd need some more work to handle even numbered lengths. I just wanted to show you how i'd attach a problem like this: decompose it into smaller problems, until you understand. also, writing tests &gt; debugging, because of the reasons above. 
If we bought it earlier on shortly after the release can we get this update somehow? Will totally pay more for it, you deserve it Love the initial release stoked to see this new world
Not entirely sure what you’re asking.
If you got it on Steam, you’ll have to wait a bit for the update as I’m still figuring that out. As for itch, if you bought it, the update should be available to you for free. Even if you didn’t set up an account with itch, you can still download it somehow using your PayPal/Stripe email iirc.
That would be an unpopular idea. But python needs more focused, polished, supported gui library imho. Pyside2 looks like best option for it.
I made all the assets. Just like any skill, it comes with practice.
Awesome wish I can learn from you 😃
I would say it is a small one. I need an interface to visualize things, I don't expect lots of screens and menus. 
Strings can be accessed like lists, no need to convert them. Albo you could do it with list func as well. Try to do it with square brackets now. Holy shit tho
It depends a bit on what the data is like and what the performance issues are. If its too much for memory, then you'll want something different than just fast lookups. If your data is effectively sparse, then maybe nornmalize / change the basis venture and convert it into a sparse representation. Would a list of the narrays work? Python won't copy them around or try to improve their representation in memory, just store pointers to them. The other solutions start to get a bit weird I think and probably preform worse. With pandas you'll probably end up with one giant array with an extra two columns (index and group number) and then have to filter on group number. A similar option might not concatenating the arrays together and keeping track of the dividing points but unless you have a ton of arrays that's probably not better than the list of arrays and would be a pain to work with. If the ns are all the same or close, you could do an (x,n,3) array. 
Thank you. I'll check it out

TEACH ME SENPAI.
I think you are having trouble with the ideas of variables, functions, and return values. You may wish to review some simple examples of those concepts before continuing. One issue is that you've defined a function with the name "random", which is the same name as the module you imported. You also try to check if random is equal to a number, when it's still the name of both your function and your module. When programming, everything should have its own name. To check what's going on in your code, try adding the line print(random) to see what random actually is.
There are a lot of errors in this code. You should watch some basic python tutorials on youtube. I can help you further when I get on a computer.

Cool _find_. Weird, in the screenshots it says "luke-gillson" and your username is lgillson.
Hevk yeah you can do that. You need to connect to an email server and send with https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html#module-smtplib and then you'll also want to set up a listener that checks for new messages on the account with https://docs.python.org/3/library/imaplib.html#module-imaplib in a loop. Once you find the response you can proceed. You can also do SMS with this approach using your provider's email-sms gateway. https://www.lifewire.com/sms-gateway-from-email-to-sms-text-message-2495456
I haven't quite found a good GUI Library in python, maybe I ma just spoiled coming from JS/Node, anyways I've been making a GUI for a project these past months and did some prior research on GUI's... &amp;#x200B; KIVY: I second it with a bunch of caveats (it's what I am using atm ) , theming is hard, learning curve is steep, documentation is wanting, not sure it is in active development, etc,etc, but it works. &amp;#x200B; [**PYImgui**](https://pyimgui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) : Looks amazing (it's a wrapper of a bother C++ library) , very modern but had issues integrating with other libraries, you might fare better. &amp;#x200B; QT: Haven't tried it, but pricing, turned me off as well as having to use their own IDE. &amp;#x200B; [WXpython, Tkinter, etc,etc](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming) : Simpler, but depends on what you consider modern might do the trick. &amp;#x200B; Another way that I experimented with is using Pygame and making my own UI Components, if you only need a few but custom elements this might work. &amp;#x200B; Good Luck ! &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Don't apologise, it's really hard! You just need a little more book-learning before we can really help you. Keep at it, and when you have questions in the future, don't hesitate to come back.
Aww man... I didn't read far enough into the thread and picked it up on Steam outta convenience. Is there away to get the source if we bought it on Steam?
PM me a screenshot of your steam library with your account visible and Super Potato Bruh selected and I'll send you the source code.
Beautiful, thank you.
Just got it! GREAT STUFF 
Thanks! :D

Hello! I'm a bot! It looks like you posted this in multiple subs in a short period of time. In the future, I suggest asking questions like this in learning focused subs like r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python.

I think pyyaml is pretty much the de facto standard for yaml in python. Note that at a quick glance, it mentions that you should only load trusted content as it's similar to pickle: arbitrary code execution is possible. It looks like a similar library to `json`: pretty much, you load and dump content, whether from/to string or file. Anything more is up to you, like default values. I wouldn't expect it to do anything with environment variables, as that's not it's job: use the standard library to use environment variables. You'll want to post this on /r/learnpython 
This presumably includes updates (to the game and source)?
Well, I got the chance to work on a project with the topic of developing a prototype of a "connection assistant" for modern, IOT based and psrtially cyberphysical production systems. It's exciting, but also quite a challenge. Wish me luck ;-)
Yeah that’s weird. I might have to check that out
Of course.

I want to game development a try. Is there a reason I should prefer pygame over godot?

I like strictyaml, built on ruamel.yaml, but it doesn't relate to environment variables. While not yaml, plumbum offers ways to accept parameters from cli options, env vars, and a config file, in a fallback fashion. 
Understand the basics more. Especially classes. Then read documentation like your life depended on it instead of just copy/pasting something you found. 
Thank you. Would it be possible to expand on this more, please? For example; like whe you learn about variables for the first time? As in they recall information when declared, but "what does that really mean"-type of attitude when starting out?
If your mind works better with less abstraction like mine does (the way engines force you to structure your stuff their way with their functions and objects), Pygame may be worth a shot. In Pygame's current state, I wouldn't recommend it over Godot, but since Pygame 2 is coming soon, I'd recommend it over Godot for 2D games if you don't like the abstraction that comes with engines. I'll still be sticking to Pygame since that's what I know though.
Before you do a project, think about it, a lot. What is required for what, what are the parts of it, which structure is effective, which classes, which functions. If there is a database, chose a design that is effective for the expected queries. Take pen and paper and think the whole thing through. Start with small portions of code, write tests, document and comment. Follow the conventions, use usable variable names. If you go bottom up or top down doesn't really matter imho, as long as it is thought out well. The thing is if you just start coding you get stuff done, but the overall design will most likely suck, it will most likely be a pain to maintain, so either do something little that is finished within itself, or think really hard about it at the beginning.
Or you take the easy way: [IFTTT helps your apps and devices work together](https://ifttt.com/).
christ
Sick, what tools did you use?
If you were starting this game today would you choose Godot over Pygame?
Love it! 🤪
Thanks for the advice. I think I'm far off from projects, but I'll definitely keep that in mind. 
Yeah. I checked there. It's not available. I heard that it's removed (?). That's why I asked.
SKIBI DOO PA PA
I have been using HDF5 for decades. It is the most efficient and reliable format for saving binary array data. Almost any software can read it (Matlab, python, R, perl, C, FORTRAN, etc.) h5py is the python interface.
Glad to hear! :D
I would choose Pygame because I know it better and I'm already super quick with it. (Just take a look at some of the stuff I pull off in 48 hour gamejams. https://cmlsc.itch.io/) If I were starting gamedev, I'd probably recommend Godot, but that may change when Pygame 2 comes out.
It's listed in the credits for the game. I used MS Paint, [Px Editor](https://cmlsc.itch.io/px-editor), and Bosca Ceoil.
There is already a port of pygame to sdl2 called unsurprisingly pygame_sdl2. It's maintained by Tom Rothamel, the guy behind the RenPy visual novel engine. It doesn't have every feature that pygame has, but it has the basics.
Princess Lettuce. Classic.
You learn the fastet when trying to realise a project, test an idea or try to solve a problem that intersts you.
write everything down; it helps you memorize things. make a handbook of your own.
Look up the os module - that should be able to do what you want it to.
thank you for the quick reply!
The os module lets you access files. If you want to read and write files, you'll want to look at the open() function (not inside os, but just as a builtin function).
Base python allows you to open files in either a read or write format. Works well with a with statement: with open(&lt;filenam&gt;, ‘r’): ‘Do stuff,, You can create logic to parse through files in a file system then use open to load the contents of the files in a ‘read’ mode and parse the files read line by line to search the contents. 
with open('my/path/to/file.myExtension', 'reqiredReadWriteFlags'): for line in f: print(f) [https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/inputoutput.html](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/inputoutput.html) &amp;#x200B;
Damn, you were faster :)
Haha luck of the draw !
The /r/ subreddit is the preferred place to ask for python help. As explained in the sidebar for *this* subreddit.
Try posting this to r/learnpython.
So cooooool ! 
Thanks, will do :)
&gt; Total newbie here so hide the pitchforks and monocles. We don't mock people for being newbies, after all, we were all there once. But we do ask that you read the text about what a subreddit is for, and the text for this one states: &gt; If you are about to ask a "how do I do this in python" question, please try r/learnpython, the Python discord, or the #python IRC channel on FreeNode.
I did other things in the various interims.
Sorry, I don't always read the sidebar, especially on mobile. I just assumed it was the right place. I'll post this again on the appropriate sub 👌
Yup
Everyone has their own ways of learning, however based on my own experience I would suggest almost entirely the opposite to this. I spent way too long trying to master the basics and thinking I can't move on until I learn all the ins and outs of all the basic data structures etc. Once I changed my approach and dove into trying to make ideas happen, that's when progress skyrocketed for me. Along the way you spend so much time reading stuff on stackoverflow and google in general, that the basics come naturally, at least enough to get yourself well on your way.
Nice game. What graphics module did you use? Anything you'd recommend?
I need to keep the data in memory since the computation is being done in parallel, so I don't think that will work unfortunately. 
I don't think this is overkill at all actually. Thank you so much!
It should be fine in memory, even though it will be large, it should be fine since I'm going to be using a massively parallel super computer. Can you just put the arrays into a list? I didn't think that was possible.
You're not as far off from projects as you think when a beginner. The sooner you try to realize an idea, the sooner the real learning process starts. One word of advice, don't get stuck thinking you need to learn the basics until you can just code the entire thing off the top of your head. Google your way out of trouble and over time you learn to do more and more without having to look things up.

Sry, it's pyqt5-tools not PyQt5 in the path.
Thanks!
If pure performance is your primary concern, I think we need some more info - how expensive are your computations versus I/O? Are you doing this on a cluster or a single computer? You may just want to do everything in C - make your own struct and use pointers appropriately so you're never copying data. Python is going to come with a lot of memory and computational overhead.

Nu 
Yeah, ppl have pointed that out and I have asked over there instead. Feel free to remove this post, but maybe it will help steer some other newbies in the right direction too.
I literally gave up on conda today. It's not just the speed issue. The constant downgrading of my packages and insistence that I use PyQt instead of PySide is frustrating.
im very new to python myself but i always see videos that say dont learn to code learn to problem solve. basically saying find a problem and then spend your time trying to fix it or make something simpler or even something you want to create and then work from there. I feel like thats the best way to learn rather than just asking someone what to do. For example if your lost i have a hacked switch and recently a friend of mine made a simple homebrew app in python and html that just is a page with around 10 anime movies loaded onto it. I didnt like all the movies but i like the idea and i was thinking about making my own, it shouldnt be too hard. so like i said just gotta find something you want to fix or create and go from there.
Check out www.micropython.org :-)
[VimGolf](http://www.vimgolf.com/)
Look at Micropython. It's a lightweight python that's also alot faster. But: even I, someone that hates C and loves Python, think that for microcontrollers etc. C is the way to go (and once it's better supported: Rust).
Do you have any sensors or anything? Without sensors, you can learn to code with your pc lol, it's not gonna be any different
Thats really cool, how did you get your graphics? Did you make them yourself? Did you pay someone to make them? Something else. If it would be ok for you to tell, in the second case, what did it cost you?
Is there a demo version?
That definitely looks like a bug on the server side.
You can specify a ?datatype query parameter, e.g. ?datatype=csv or ?datatype=xls From what i saw, they only offer those 2 types. Reference: https://financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs

As someone who has to provide Linux apps as binaries to different companies that use different Linux versions... You compile your apps on oldest distro possible, so that all of your users will have newer libs than those that come with your app. I think you should set up a computer or a VM with an old Linux distro (I think Steam still supports Ubuntu 12.02, so that might be the one you should try), and then prepare the Steam distribution on that old distro which has old glibc and other libs which newer versions will support. Debian stable is too important and popular distro, it should definately be supported. So my humble advice would be for you to setup a build machine or vm with Ubuntu 12, as use that to prepare your game for binary distribution, eg. Steam. As for outside Steam, everything is good cause package maintainers will keep the application in sync with all it's dependencies on any given Linux distro that has a package for your game in their repos.
There are two common ways to solve this I’ve seen. The simple option is to immediately respond to the initial request with a UUID (or some other unique identifier) and attach that to the request as it passes through the pipeline. The client can then make multiple calls to check if the request associated with that identifier has completed. The more complicated option is to set up websockets and have the client send an event for the initial request and the server send another event for the response. 
I tend to have a vm lying around with the oldest Ubuntu in LTS and build on that. I figure if that's the oldest they're willing to support then it's also the oldest I'll support. It tends to make most glibc support requests go away. :) 
Your app literally checks the battery level as often as humanly possible. That can't be good for battery life. Have you considered ways to have the OS tell you the battery level has changed?
It shows the current battery level which as you said is humanly possible ofc. But for example you have opened the app at 40% battery and you have set low battery as 20% and then you press run, the app will we constantly get updated as the battery reduces. Now , for example 30 mins have passed and your battery is 25% , my app will also be showing the same battery percentage and whenever your battery reaches 20% (which you've set for low battery) , then you will get the notifications. In this video I had kept the notification levels as per the battery level at that time, just for a tutorial as to what the app does exactly.. I hope I am able to clarify what you think was wrong with the app? Or maybe you can try to again explain your question to me?
Your app literally does this: while True: battery_level = read_battery_level() if battery_level ...: send_notification() This basically means it's using an entire CPU core, constantly, to just spin in this loop forever. This will drain your battery really quickly, because your CPU core will not be able to go into a low power sleep state, ever.
Well yes my app kind of does what you displayed in the code but I didn't really face any problem with it tbh but I will see if i can change it considering your point..
Did you try to run it on your own laptop btw?
Cool. Yeah, as a beginner, Godot just seems like a more practical way to make something worthwhile is less time. I love Python, though, it's a shame they didn't use it.
Im actually planning to move the code over to C and use struct before we do the performance tests on a cluster, now that you mention it. For now I think I'll just use a list to store the arrays.
Super Potato *Bruh* Gotta say, the visuals are astonishing!
Hey mate,I checked out the page.I liked the game very much.I would like to suggest that an addition of a section that implies the use of quicker maths,or maybe something that involves a series of multiplications/additions/divisons/subtractions might be fun. Keep up the good work!
Thx for the reply and especially for checking the page. Yup, I have all of those in pipeline. I constantly check a YouTube page of a maths guy who explains tricks on multiplication division etc and I plan on implementing those. 
Thanks
Great answer! Thanks!

&gt; If you need a front end I highly recommend turning your script into a web app aka just do a web GUI. It's super simple using e.g. Flask, and web apps are almost universally cross platform since nearly every networked device has a web browser. Not to mention you can simply install it in one place and serve it up, instead of having to install the program on each individual machine. &gt; &gt; I'm fairly good with Tkinter, but I have no idea where to start with setting up a web app. I currently pull data for my Tkinter GUI from a Flask API running with Cherrypy and would like to switch to a web app. I need a widget similar to Tkinter treeview. Could you point me somewhere to get started? Thanks
Looks good. I believe you should use [themed widgets](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html) from ttk instead of old-style widgets in new Tkinter applications.
No, but there are full playthroughs on YouTube.
I only used Pygame.
Thanks for the kind words. Here's the ticket [for Run All](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-32071). Here's the [full issue list](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues?q=%23%7BJupyter%20Notebook%7D%20) for Jupyter tickets. I couldn't find one for your second point but perhaps I overlooked it.
pygame_sdl2 don't even support 2 channel voluming last time I check. Good news is, pygame can actually be compiled with sdl2 at the moment.
Thank you. I remember using combobox from ttk in one of my example. I will try other widgets too.
Since you also distribute binary, maybe [compiling with SDL2](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/Compilation) is worth a try?
I would use selenium: https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/ selenium has support for all these things. It can be a little bit of a a pain to get going, but once you do it's a fantastic tool for a huge amount of web automation
Why not use a webhook towards Slack, Twist, PagerDuty, Hangout Chat, SMS service provider?
I didn’t give a look to you project but i found a nice template for mine at https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2
Yes, I probably should have waited a bit more before starting to point people in the direction of the project. But, in a month or two the project should be in a pretty good shape in terms of documentation, etc. I'll also probably host it so that people can use it without having to clone the repo and install/configure the application. Thanks for your interest, anyway :)
Is this a downloadable app, is it available for Mac, and if both of those are true, did you use and installer and what did you use to make the installer? I’m trying to make a Mac installer for my frozen python programs but I’m on Windows. It would be great if I knew what program you used so I could use it too! Thank you.
Also maybe you should prepare the code beforehand and just copy paste it in the video. I found myself skipping half the video because it took quite the time for you to type the code. 
I used to use this in the 90's for porn. 
Only available on Linux and Windows. I had some CWD issues with Mac that didn’t seem fixable.
Not even I know, forget what I said....
Oh OK. Makes sense. Thanks. Your game looks very well done!

I think the point is, add an option to poll by set intervals.
I suppose I do have an idea I'm working on. Silly, and probably a more efficient way to do it. But it has been getting me to think aboit everything I have to consider. It's been a lot of fun, and no errors so far :D

Hi. &amp;#x200B; I am the author of [lyricsmaster](https://pypi.org/project/lyricsmaster/), a python library for downloading lyrics from multiple lyrics providers. The following Lyrics Providers are supported: * Lyric Wikia * AzLyrics * Genius * Lyrics007 * MusixMatch &amp;#x200B; I read you post and the response it generated earlier today. You have done a great job with your bot :) I just wanted to let you know that you and the other users interested in getting lyrics from more than one lyrics provider can use lyricsmaster either as a stand-alone cli program or as a library installable via a pip install to interact and get lyrics from the previously cited providers. It supports asynchronous downloading of songs as well as anonymous requests through [the Tor anonymization network](https://2019.www.torproject.org/index.html.en). &amp;#x200B; This is a completely free and open source project released under MIT Licence and you are all welcome to provide comments, improvement suggestions etc... &amp;#x200B; Cheers :) &amp;#x200B; SekouD
Haha yes! pip install and apt-get was my inspiration!
Will you be posting the source? I wanted to implement something like this on a project I was doing, but what I came up with tanked performance. 
That was something superb man! 🤔
Depends of the game but if you give me more info i can help you.
Sure! (I hope my code is okay as I'm a newbie) https://github.com/bharat-nair/pyprogress 
Hahaha dude I've been dabbling in Python for years now and still almost none of the documentation makes sense to me. I'm probably just a moron I guess. 
Well, no documentation means any sense to me. That's why I rely on bolded words or updates from Reddit about X or Y, and or Z. I'm just recently learning Pygame, so I was surprised/interested in a new update. Maybe they would make two code lines to make a whole game for me. ;)
Something like a = numpy.arange(10) b = numpy.arange(100) c = [a, b] c[0] == a c[1] == b will be fine then.
There's many available progressbar libraries for python. My fav is tqdm `pip install tqdm`
Sounds to me like the major change here is the ability to build with SDL2 in preparation for PyGame 2. I believe I saw recently that PyGame 2 will support graphic acceleration of your code so this is a cool update but it's more of a backend update that doesn't add a lot of obvious new features right now 
that sounds like a good way yes also maybe safer in case connection breaks 
Lol
Instead of using print, try redirecting it to an output file. I think that would be a great addition.
You could keep it simple and use Haar Cascades to detect a static hand signal like thumbs up or thumbs down which would be easier than a true “gesture”
Should I write the progress bar and then read it again from the file? Sorry if I didn't get you 
tqdm is really cool!
tqdm also works on dataframes. Helped me when trying to estimate how long my jobs would complete. Turns out I had to run my workstation overnight. :( 
I wish I understood what you actually meant and I can probably google/youtube it. But since it's probably not in my area, I'll leave it at your explanation for now.
Think of it as a computer upgrade. Like you added RAM. You might notice a performance change and you might not. But it prepared you for installing a resource hog. It's not a perfect analogy but it kind of explains my thinking
Ohh! Graphic *acceleration* I get it. Thank you :)

THANK YOU! You just put an iter into this thing and that's it so nice I've been needing this
&gt; try redirecting it to an output file by "it" I mean the output of your program. ```print``` doesn't distinguish between stdout and stderr, and prints everything to stdout. I would recomend using a method that lets you choose if you want to print to stdout or stderr. This would be useful when, let's say you want to display a warning or error.
I think @ahk-_- meant that you should save to a file the results of the test.
Here are locations for PySimpleGUI documentation: [Main docs](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org) [Cookbook](http://Cookbook.PySimpleGUI.org) [YouTube Tutorials](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9nvdmw/tutorial_beginning_as_in_your_first_time_gui/)
Oh okay I got you! Now I know the difference between print and stdout
The code is muuuuch easier to get into (better organised cleaner code). Lots of rough things fixed in various modules (especially in the mask, midi, draw, and math modules). Lots of corner cases have been tested for and fixed. For newbies, the documentation navigation is now organized with the most important core modules, and then the advanced modules later. Most people probably need to use things like Surface, but don't really care about midi or cdrom as an example. For the future, pygame 2 now works with SDL2 which is less buggy and provides features like multiple windows, touch support, and various other goodies. I've been using the sound input, and touch support in my video synth. One really good feature of pygame 2 is that you can make your game at a low resolution (640x480 for example) and have it work fast on 4k screens. pygame 2 does all the scaling (of video and things like mouse coordinates) for you. Code that worked with pygame 19 years ago can still work today. Even with pygame 2, that is our goal.
That’s freaking amazing! I love especially the documentation edit! Yes, I’m currently working with Surface only and don’t know much more above that. Thank you!
The built in logging functions work too.
Siiiick
Since you need in memory, consider using redis to store buffers. As long as the redis node has enough memory, this is probably the most efficient. 
I’d use VTK. It’s tuned for very large data sets, so for engineers, not artists.
Hell yes dude, keep it up!
Thank you!
There possibly is, but I can't think of one
[Yes.](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/chr)
Ahh thanks! 
Ay thanks!
Hah no worries man! I’m a rookie as well :)
I really don't think that's true. From the ground up I've written game engines in C, C++, JS, and Python. Python is by far the slowest language for game dev purposes. 
Why is this a 10 minutes video? Can you just put the source code on github?
Μπράβο!

You mean you imported a download bar.
Looks nice and implementation is a breeze. Great stuff, well done!
You got me!
Thank you very much!

Laziness can be useful but not essential, check ML family. Python cannot work well in fp style, for it's not designed for this. Decades on people talked about tailrec and pattern matching in python, but trampoline hurts calling stacktraces, and pattern matching compilation just requires static type info or it will be too slow and come down to dynamic contract instead(check pampy, really ridiculous to someone who're in PL major). I do like FP and has written a lot of Haskell, OCaml and F#, but in python side, I'd suggest NO FP in python, please. I think that FP makes no sense in python has been proven by time. Don't use such a title to induce newbies to write so-called FP python any more. Finally, I think Guido won't get that delightful if he find there're still attempts anout FP python.

Definitely won't be allowed in testing rooms now. 
How about something with graphing? Companies value skills that are transferable, so a graphing project could show that you've got a deep enough understanding of the source material that you're able to make meaningful visualizations. Off the top of my head, maybe a sports-related graph to appeal to the statistical side of your education, or comparative financial graphs to appeal to the business side? The world is truly your oyster here - depends on your concentration I suppose.
Hi, I'm sorry that I cannot get your meme here, could you explain it for a pitiful and lonely girl?
The gamedev process is reliant on other frameworks and stuff for a lot of people. That’s why I said game logic. 
My phyton non wan ya unless you got big bun hun
Wow, I missed that. Thanks!
Those are implemented in C, not Python. Also, /r/learnpython.
I am aware of that, but how do I view them?
I was unaware of that sub, thanks! Helps to declutter this sub's post too I guess
You can't view them from the intepreter, as C is a compiled language, so the source code of Python is not normally available to you. You can browse the source code online on [Github](https://github.com/python/cpython).
You could always checkout Python's git repository. All the source code for Python is in there.
I can't get this to work on Windows with reddit. I log in with the credentials and the "Log into accounts" tab says I'm logged in. When I try to delete my posts, I get a "not logged in" error. 
Try something like this instead: def main(): thread_tasks = [(hello, 1.0), (bye, 0.25)] for task, time in thread_tasks: thread = threading.Timer(time, task) thread.start()
The price of these always surprises me, compared to cheap phones. The factory bosses must be laughing all the way to the bank with their wheelbarrows of money.
I went on to read the other article that you linked to: Making a case for Rust for Python developers. In it, the anecdote about moving from Node js to Rust, it says that the user saw a 90 % drop in CPU usage and 50% in memory. What exactly is it about Rust that makes that possible? Im a total noob at this, so Im not even sure about how CPU usage as a metric works with program execution. Is it just the no. of CPU cycles to execute all the machine instructions corresponding to the source program? On the whole, I liked both articles. I'm really only competent in Python so I'd like to learn another language *in depth* as I'd like to think Im doing with Python. However, I still feel maybe Rust is too much for me at this stage. I'm more or less proficient at C. Do you think it would make sense in this case to explore Rust, or would it be better to learn a simpler language like Go and try out Rust later?
Working on duplicating Powerpoint slides using Python-pptx library. It works with few slides but return blank slides if source has many slides and a master slide. Trying to figure this out.
Any benchmarks on this?
Hey, congrats on your GUI! It works great. Was able to download and run your code. I don't have sam.exe installed, so I don't get the sounds, but that's OK as I'm interested in the GUI. Can you see if [this GUI](https://gist.github.com/MikeTheWatchGuy/5ac1fe5432f4fae5f12546044616d3f1) does the same thing and if it'll run the SAM.EXE file on your system? If it's too much trouble, that's OK, I went through the process of writing the GUI which was educational. Your GUI has been duplicated using PySimpleGUI (I think). This package grows by either users creating programs or the PSG developers creating programs using it. In other words, I learn by trying to copy other people's GUIs. I'm interested in your feedback [u/redditgoogle](https://www.reddit.com/user/redditgoogle) since you just went through the GUI development process using tkinter. Hoping you find this alternate implementation to be readable by you. That was my goal. That you would recognize your GUI window reading the code. Again, continuations on your program.
Typically low CPU usage is inherent to all low level languages. There is no run time in language. It's as bare metal as you can get unless you are coding in assembly itself. Python is too dynamic in nature. Garbage collection, being interpreted and dynamic in nature makes python much slower than C/C++/Rust. You can try to compile a python code using Cython(python to C compiler) to see how many type checks and lookups needed for even primitive operations. If you are familiar with C and want to learn something new entirely I would recommend Rust.( Lot of concepts I learnt here made me appreciate programming itself in general) I like Go. It's useful for some parts of my work. But I didn't learn any new things though while learning Go.

It's useful for some parts of my work. It's extremely easy to get into. But I didn't learn any new concepts though while learning Go(apart from channels). Programming paradigm is similar in both Rust and Go(composition over inheritance). Go still has the overhead of GC and I couldn't leverage it for Python(which is my primary language) easily because of runtime it has. With Rust, I can write performance sensitive part in Rust and extend my python code with this very neatly. I used to use c and Cython previously. But Rust is much pleasant to write and sometimes it feels like I am actually writing a python code.(especially when you use iterators heavily). Nowadays Python and Rust became my primary languages. 
How did you handle the fighting mechanics?
Yo, really cool stuff! You can add some functionality by taking command line arguments. So you'd type from the terminal &amp;#x200B; pyprogress [www.pics.com/pic](https://www.pics.com/pic) ./picfile.jpg
Pressing A button now, sir
Just with the controls you have when you play normally.
So twitch probably wont be able to handle the fights, right?
Well. It may be difficult. But not impossible 😅
