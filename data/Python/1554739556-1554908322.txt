 result = '{this} {that}!'.format_map(locals()) would also work.
You could probably get it to work, but it would take some coercion. It looks like the object returns a string as its return value when queried. Numpy arrays wouldn't really know how to work with those. You could do np.genfromtxt, but then you'd lose all the comparative dunder methods. Maybe setting the dtype in numpy would work? No idea... Play around with it! 
Would Julia work?
Nice! Repo starred ;)

That's... horrifying. What the heck is that? Some way to try to get a case/switch statement without giving us a case/switch statement? That looks like it's a hot spot for bugs (just miss one of those "nots"). It's also harder to follow the logic. 
You should add a trigger warning mate. 
also, df.describe() to get statistics of a dataframe right away.
I don't really know. I have always been put off by the scarcity of packages available for Julia. I have never tried it nor read any of the docs, so I wouldn't know. The technicalities that make Julia faster are very interesting, though.
But would you want a function to fail silently like this?
&gt; closed as off-topic Those words always make me wish the website were a person I could murder. I can't tell you how many times I've found someone asking my exact question, but the only answer I find is *closed as off-topic*.
How about a big efficiency that's improved my programming hugely? The concept of pure functions. A pure function always produces that same outputs for the same inputs. The benefits of this are several. The code is easier to read because all the inputs and outputs are on one line, not strewn throughout the function in the form of member variables or globals. The code is easier to test because you can create all the inputs directly, instead of instantiating a class and setting whatever random member variables need to be set. The code is easier to think about, because instead of thinking about state and how it gets mutated, you think about data and the transformations applied to it. That last bit is one of those things where it might not make sense coming from someone else until you really grok it yourself. This can get construed as a criticism of Object Oriented Programming. I see it as more of a criticism of bad OOP, which, unfortunately, tends to be the dominant form of OOP (in my humble experience). OOP has its place. Not a tiny thing to just pick and up use, but I think it's something that's super effective for improving programming at multiple levels.
itertuples() when iterating through a dataframe
It's fairly new. In development for a decade, 1.0 released around last year. It can call python, so I think, by extension, it can call all it's packages, but that's a huge assumption on my part.
Doesn't it though? https://github.com/ambv/black/blob/master/README.md#the-black-code-style: "It doesn't reformat blocks that start with # fmt: off and end with # fmt: on."
`isinstance` is an expensive operation and should be avoided in hot loops and functions.
I have been using Kite for the past two months, my 2 cents. &amp;#x200B; If you use PyCharm, the added value is almost non existant. PyCharm built-in doc module: * is faster * gives me the complete doc in a structured format * works on my own classes/functions * can access remote docs (in settings) * is better integrated (of course it is) &amp;#x200B; How about the code completion ? I have yet to see an useful suggestion. The start = 0 stop = 10 np.linspace(start, stop) example from the homepage is too simple and not really representative of my experience of kite. &amp;#x200B; Oh, and 550+ MB memory usage as I am writing this.
&gt; The title of the post was specifically about Python for data science, not Python for other purposes. I don't see how one can do any kind of meaningful data science or data analysis in Python without pandas. I also don't see anyone shouting from the rooftops that Python shouldn't be used for data science till pandas reaches v 1 Pandas is a good package; I don't disagree with that. Just don't expect the API to be 100% static (they said it's not), especially when they're good about deprecation warnings. &gt; but if I had to use them for some kind of production system, I'd be terrified. Why? Fix the version and/or have automated testing.​ My 8 year long open source project has gotten hit with multiple Python version upgrade crashes, numpy/scipy/pandas incompatibilities. It's usually a small, single thing each time that you need to fix and then it just works on the old version and the new version. &gt; in deciding which tool to use, assessing the quality of the documentation is, IMHO, a very important factor, because the most powerful tool is close to useless if it must take you days to find out how to do stuff which is explained very clearly in the docs of another, less powerful tool. The simple solution is to pick a popular one and run with it. As someone who writes open source documentation, the problems are: 1) too much documentation makes things hard to find 2) how many times should you repeat yourself? The more you do the user has to sift through more cruft. 3) A project is only as good as it's community. You know the popular projects, so if they're deficient, make a pull request or open an issue. The developers are often in too deep and it all just makes sense. That's how I've found errors in Python, numpy, scipy, and matplotlib that I've gone to the effort to document and get fixed. &gt; often appallingly poor documentation I 100% disagree with that in regards to core libraries like numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and pandas.
Based on both your link and Guido's comment (and my personal experience), I'd probably call it a "chaining" pattern, if you need to name it. And the point Guido makes (note that his comment is from 2003, which predates most of the data science explosion from this decade as well as the web dev explosion starting mid 2000s), is probably the same one I'm trying to make. Traditionally, Python encouraged returning a (often python primative) value type rather than `self`. Chaining was at least originally discouraged. I can see the use-case, especially for something like Spark which provides its API specifically in a chaining mechanism so it can distribute and pipeline data more easily. However, I think that pattern should generally be discouraged in Python. One more note: I've been using Python professionally for a couple of decades, so I may be biased.
Ban this crap.
Haha, maybe is related to budget, but you have a good point.
This looks stellar. Going to try this out.
Be cautious with that, as 1e7 is a float and not an integer anymore, so make sure to cast when needed.
As soon as I saw your comment it made me a remember a talk by James Powell that I saw.
Or you could just write 1e8
I'm there. I grow my terminal font to a size that I would've never 10 years ago. I still get more than 80 characters in my terminal but I still like the 80 char limit because I find code more readable like this: if ( some_condition and some_value &lt;= SOME_MAX_VALUE and is_still_cool(foo) ): ... I almost always use less than 80 characters anyway by opening up longer stuff over multiple lines for readability, the exception usually being lines with variables set to a constant URI or a comment with a URI in it.
Omg... That's awesome
If you need to write numbers larger than 1000 you are doing something wrong
The thing that jumps to mind for me is Counters. I use these surprisingly often
And if the number got digits other than 0 or 1, the scientific version wouldn't help that much. And don't forgot about other number bases, the _ works for them aswell.
That's nice but I work a lot with relative newbies and I think this is the kind of thing that would confuse them unnecessarily.
If comprehension gets long, I'd usually break that up across multiple lines: even = [ number for number in list_a if number % 2 == 0 ] Makes it easier to read IMO, with the value in the list being the first line, what we're iterating across in the 2nd, and the filter/condition in the third.

What do you mean "fix the version"? Over a very short period, pandas first deprecated DataFrame.as\_matrix for .values, then deprecated that for .numpy. If you have a very large code base, refactoring all your code to keep up with all these changes is doable but not pleasant (a tool like PyCharm clearly helps). &amp;#x200B; I agree that too much documentation can be counterproductive, but there are too many undocumented features. I made the example of the C vs python parser in read\_csv. There is no explicit mention of the fact that a pandas date column can have one row formatted as dd-mm-yyyy and another as mm-dd-yyyy This last point is huge; it can invalidate years of work! &amp;#x200B; I recently had to format the axis of a matplotlib chart to datetime; I found [this](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/api/date.html) example on the matplotlib site, but it didn't work. I found this one on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43969357/4045275), and it worked. Little stuff like makes you waste an incredible amount of time, and is a huge obstacle. I still use Python - I am just realistic about how poor the docs are and about all the obstacles that derive from it. &amp;#x200B; Have you read this [interview](https://numfocus.org/blog/matplotlib-lead-developer-explains-why-he-cant-fix-the-docs-but-you-can) in which the lead developer for Matplotlib explains why even he can't rally fix the docs? &amp;#x200B; &gt; We are woefully under-documented, in the sense that not everything has good docs. On the other hand, we are over-documented in that what we have is not well organized, and there’s not a clear entry-point, and if you want to find out how to do something, even I have a hard time finding where something is documented. And if *I* \[the Lead Developer\] have issues finding it, there’s just no prayer of new users finding it. So in that sense, we are both drastically under-documented and drastically over-documented.
Git
Yes it is.
I disagree I have written code years ago that I open now and am thankful I commented.
So this kind of leads to this: with open(path) as f: for line in f: ... A lot of people don't know this, but just iterating across the `f` part of the open context manager will generate lines, and it's smart about it and buffers the file. It's actually the better way to process a file line by line since it uses a lot of buffering magic behind the curtain, and it's way more readable than any alternative.
Is there a performance overhead?
I'm always using zip to iterate over things coming from np.where. It's charming 😃
Yes
Confirmed
For some reason the zip trick always ends up useful in interviews and always ends up blowing their mind lol. I swear I've got tons of points from knowing this trick
I agree with you.
I believe there’s a race condition in the first one too
It's not good for a function to fail silently, but you might want a function to be able to work without default arguments, but the default arguments allow more customisation of behaviour. It's good for maintaining older code that might call a function that you now want to change without changing the entire code base. So if you had something before like this: &amp;#x200B; `def export_results(arg1):` `export_filename = "Results.csv"` `send_to_csv(arg1, export_filename)` `...` &amp;#x200B; But then you wanted to make it possible to change the results filename, you could change the function to be: &amp;#x200B; `def export_results(arg1, export_filename="Results.csv"):` `send_to_csv(arg1, export_filename)` `...` &amp;#x200B; That would still work the same as the first example if it was called from an older bit of code, but you can now change the exported filename.
I always feel the need to post this every time someone mentions default arguments: https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/gotchas/
Default values for options dicts: \`\`\` default = {"a": 0, "b": 0} new = {"a": 5} print({\*\*default, \*\*new}) \# {'a': 5, 'b': 0} \`\`\`
If you use python2.x you don't have to us parentheses with your print statements.
THIS! Variable names and clear code are the way forward.
Merging dict with default: default = {"a": 0, "b": 0} new = {"a": 5} print({**default, **new}) # {'a': 5, 'b': 0}
Usually that means you're doing a lot of non-clear, idiomatic things or naming things non-descriptively, in my experience. I almost always know what my old code is doing with a quick scan. I comment parts that are not-intuitive or design decisions that aren't usual/documentable in code (like explaining what a formatted string read from a file looks like so the parsing logic is easily followable) Of course, if it's a choice between over commented code and under commented, I'll rarely complain if the comments are up to date.
Don't see why not. Just tried the following in console: &gt;&gt;&gt; a = array([Distance(m=1), Distance(m=2), Distance(m=3)]) &gt;&gt;&gt; 2 * a array([Distance(m=2.0), Distance(m=4.0), Distance(m=6.0)], dtype=object) &gt;&gt;&gt; a * a array([Area(sq_m=1.0), Area(sq_m=4.0), Area(sq_m=9.0)], dtype=object) &gt;&gt;&gt; a / Distance(m=2) array([0.5, 1.0, 1.5], dtype=object) &gt;&gt;&gt; [d.inch for d in a] [39.37007874015748, 78.74015748031496, 118.11023622047244]
Yeah, this is definitely useful in 2.7 but 3.6+ has f strings now and it's made for this. Honestly python should've just had f strings since the beginning. Also be wary if you ever template like that and take user input as the string that gets templated. user_data.format(**locals()) If it's like that for any reason, you're giving access to a lot more than you might want. If user_data is `'{os.environ}'` and you imported os, that can be bad
That's a neat idea but those two pieces of code are not completely equivalent. What if it's d?
I'm not sure why you think it returns a string: &gt;&gt;&gt; Distance(m=1).inch 39.37007874015748 &gt;&gt;&gt; type(Distance(m=1).inch) &lt;class 'float'&gt;
&gt; Instead of: &gt; &gt; if a: &gt; if b: &gt; if c: &gt; return # useful &gt; else: &gt; return # fooC &gt; else: &gt; return # fooB &gt; else: &gt; return # fooA &gt; &gt; &gt; You can have: &gt; &gt; if not a: &gt; return # fooA &gt; if not b: &gt; return # fooB &gt; if not c: &gt; return # fooC &gt; &gt; return # useful formatting fixed

Why not use 1e7 for even better readability?
`0111001101110101011001000110111100100000011100100110110100100000001011010111001001100110001000000010110100101101011011100110111100101101011100000111001001100101011100110110010101110010011101100110010100101101011100100110111101101111011101000010000000101111` `HCF`
I really like the `else` for `try` blocks. It's great because it really breaks up a common pattern I sometimes see like this: try: foo = json.loads(some_user_data) do_stuff_with(foo) except ValueError: sys.exit("invalid json: {!r}".format(some_user_data)) I've seen stuff like that where people expect the ValueError to only come from the first part, but they don't realize they're catching all ValueErrors in the other code in the try block too, so they might see their program exit and it print out valid json and be super confusing. Moving everything below to an else block ensures it only runs if the json is valid, AND ensures they'll raise their own exceptions even if it's a ValueError. You could put that stuff outside of the try/except block too in this case, but if you had a finally block that you want to run after the `do_stuff_with(foo)`, then that wouldn't be preferable. The `else` in `try` allows you to run stuff before the finally and only if the first part passes.
I admit the elegance doesn't come through with this contrived example, but it's used like a lot like `break` is: "if 'stop-condition' is met, stop". Except you don't stop the entire for loop, you go to the next item. Here's where I first saw it used: https://stackoverflow.com/a/2137789/5932228 I like how, instead of burying the `nextpositions.add(np)` inside of two checks, this algorithm first checks two stop-conditions before going on with the loop. It seems cleaner imo, but of course that's just an opinion.
Not direct development, but I've been using "screen" for all my ssh sessions. The ability to attach and detach sessions and not worrying about losing connection is awesome. Both for long build processes as well as basic system maintenance. Also bash related "!!" ie: repeat last command. Very nice with sudo as in "sudo !!" when you forgot to sudo before.
Location: Provo UT or remote Requirements: Async python experience We're a startup called Blip Billboards that's democratizing the electronic billboard space by making it possible to buy ads 8 seconds at a time for cents instead of months at a time for thousands. One of the core components of that is the actual software that controls all those signs. It has to be reliable and robust to unreliable internet connectivity and it has to support multiple operating systems. Currently, I'm the primary developer responsible for this software, but I'm finding myself stretched thin between it and server side / ops issues as we grow. If you're interested in being able to drive past billboards all over the nation and tell people that your software is controlling those billboards, then this job has that as a fun perk.
Integrating C and python is very interesting, I am a C developer and love C so it's useful for C developers.

I mostly use .read of .readlines in case I want to get the content, not loop over the file handle.
I'm working on my company's \`django\` application revamping our South American division's PDF file download of their credit memo reports to match the design they offered. Basically that means I'm: \- untangling the web that is our own ancient database architecture to use what data I need \- learning how to use the Python \`reportlab\` library's Canvas object to draw it up the way they want it.
Location: Provo UT Dev Ops Requirements: Python, Django, Heroku experience and some architectural savvy. We run on a growing network of about 700 billboards in the US and Canada. We run a responsive bidding system to allow small businesses to buy billboard ads where and when they want. We owe it to the sign owners to ensure that we keep their signs up and running reliably. At the same time, we owe it to the small businesses and individuals who buy ads to give them good visibility into what's happening and high availability. Our server side is currently based around Python / Django / Postgres / Heroku. As we continue to scale we're looking for help in achieving the next level in terms of reliability. Specifically, two large changes are coming as we move from Heroku to a more general containerized strategy and as we outgrow Heroku's postgres plan. We're looking for someone who is competent in Python and Django and has an understanding of databases but also has an instinct for and interest in architecture and the dev ops side of things.
It also encourages people to actually READ THE CODE and not rely on potentially badly outdated comments
thanks, fixed it!
Do you know of a good hello world type example of running c code from python?
memoization is definitely helpful. Also, this stuff can really help with webapps where some common requests are run that take a lot of time calculating stuff and you can just cache the result. Redis allows you to set an expiration, so you can really increase performance with it sometimes. For example, this caches results for 10 minutes: def cached(key): def decorator(func): def decorated(*args): func_sig = f"{key};{sha256(repr(args))}" val = redis.get(func_sig) if val is not None: return val result = func(*args) redis.set(func_sig, result, ex=600) return result return decorated return decorator @cached("get_stats") def get_stats(foo, bar): do_time_consuming_stuff(...) ... I've wrapped the celery task decorator before to cache all celery results like this so it doesn't even have to trigger a task if it already knows the result.
I disagree. The only thing that could go wrong is the filter condition. If the condition is simple or broken out into a function, then you can test the filter condition thoroughly and write super dense filter code. ``` list_a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] even = filter(filterUtils.is_even_number, list_a) ``` nothing wrong with that
I was assuming they meant using the object, rather than the object's properties. What you're showing is the output from the property of `.inch`, not the type of the `Distance()` object itself. &gt;&gt;&gt; distance = Distance(m=1) &gt;&gt;&gt; type(distance) &lt;class 'measurement.measures.distance.Distance'&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; type(distance.inch) &lt;class 'float'&gt; So, you couldn't put the `Distance()` objects themselves into the numpy array and have it do anything meaningful with them, like sort (so far as I'm aware - I could be **ENTIRELY** wrong here). You *could* use the `Distance()` objects to pre-process your data before dumping it into the numpy array as the output of the [static property method value](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/python-measurement/blob/master/measurement/base.py#L144) using the syntax you used above (i.e. `distance.inch`, or whatever measurement you want). So, dropping that `float` in there is fine, but dropping the `Distance()` object and expecting to be able to manipulate the measurement base internally within the numpy array probably isn't (again, so far as I'm aware - the numpy argument `dtype` might be useful here. I'm not sure.). If that makes any sense.
What about the part where he opens the file for single line of that he has to write.
I love how for-else loops can remove need for additional logic and clean up the code. They can be difficult to read when nested, though, so it's best to either document those cases well or find other ways to write them... for fpath in getFilesToCheck(): if os.path.exists(fpath): break else: print("None of the files were found. Panic!") sys.exit(1) doStuffWith(fpath).
The continue keyword while in a for loop means to immediately go to the next iteration of the loop. The "nots" are just a product of the example OP chose, not something that always shows up. An example for when I often use continue is when processing a file line by line with comment lines beginning with # that I want to ignore. Instead of: for line in f: if not line.startswith("#"): ... You can do: for line in f: if line.startswith("#"): continue ... This avoids a not, plus removes a level of indentation from most of the body of your for loop.
Sorry, I have no idea. I'm for sure not the person to answer that question. Also, check out the conversation thread between /u/madman_bob and myself for further clarification. [I was incorrect in my initial post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/basnhi/python_programmers_of_reddit_whats_the_most/ekee0rv/) - though there are probably still problems putting the `Distance()` object into the array.
Fuck new Reddit.
I've never thought to set `__dict__` to `kwargs`... I've always used setattr if I've done anything like this. That's a neat trick though, as long as you set the `__dict__` as the very first line and never set it after initializing other variables. I've done stuff like this when I wrote an ORM for mongodb so you could store arbitrary documents, and have a class that loads each record into a class instance with arbitrary attributes for each value in the record. It can be useful.
This can actually be useful though if you write classes that relate to records in a document DB, or any document with arbitrary fields really. Since documents in a document based DB like mongodb can contain arbitrary documents by nature, it can be useful.
One reason that the 80 char limit is useful is for visually impaired programmers that use refreshable braille displays which are limited to 80 characters.
Fluent interfaces just make sense to me. If libraries started to make this more convoluted and less readable just to satisfy some 'pythonic' edict I'd look into switching languages
&gt; In Python 3.6 and later you'd just write f"{this} {that}!" !! I cracked up in the middle of the office at this one. Got weird looks.
&gt; What do you mean "fix the version"? Use one version. In your requirements, do something like ``pandas == 0.23.4``. You support what you've validated. Also, tests are great for expanding that range. I wouldn't use any package that doesn't have tests in a production environment and that includes one I wrote. &gt; Over a very short period, pandas first deprecated DataFrame.as_matrix for .values, then deprecated that for .numpy. Again, that's not pandas fault. They literally can't support the new version of numpy with that method because numpy is dropping the class. &gt; I made the example of the C vs python parser in read_csv. For something so trivial, submit a pull request or open an issue rather than complaining about something not worth complaining about. It's a simple oversight. &gt; Have you read this interview Yes. You also left out the title. &gt; Matplotlib Lead Developer Explains Why He Can’t Fix the Docs—**But You Can** &gt; Because one of the things I have the hardest time with is, I personally am very bad at putting myself in other people’s shoes when writing docs. I don’t know from a user’s point of view—and this sounds obnoxious but **I’m deep enough in the code**—from a user’s point of view, with what they know coming into the library as a new person, I don’t know the right things to tell them in the docstring that are going to actually help them. I can try to guess and I’ll probably write too much, or the wrong things, or worse—I’ll write a bunch of stuff that refers to things they don’t know about, and now I’ve just made it more confusing. &gt; Whereas that user who has just encountered this function for the first time, sorted out how to make it do what they need it to do for their purposes—they are at the perfect place where they understand it, and they are in the right mindset to write what they wish it had said that would have saved them an hour. I already stated this issue previously; **The developers are often in too deep**. In other words, they can't see the forest from the trees. They know the package so well and all those little obscure tricks that aren't documented, but are great for some unintended use case. They don't use the package wrong, so they don't hit the errors or have those misconceptions about the package handles data that users and especially beginners do. &gt; I found this example on the matplotlib site Did you use the right version? I've never had an issue with matplotlib examples working. Also, 2.2.4 is out.
collections is an awesome module. Also, Counter and namedtuple are great. Counter can be especially useful for doing frequency analysis if you want to decrypt something with an XOR key or something... from collections import Counter ctr = Counter(some_xor_encrypted_data) most_common = ctr.most_common()[0][0] xor_key = most_common ^ ord(" ") That works most of the time.
&gt; Cmder integration (on my Windows work machine) enabled I use conemu, do you mind expanding on this a bit? A couple years back I remember attempting this and there being some weird fragile work arounds.

Yeah but you have to use python 2.x
Casting just means wrapping it in int()? e.g. int(1e7)?
Looping over the file handle returns it line by line and not character by character, which is useful for larger files where they need to be buffered instead of fully loaded into memory at once. And honestly I just fine this easier to read than readlines, which I'd only use if I need to actually keep each line in memory and not just process it line by line.
I believe pyCharm is the same as Black. I used it for about 20 minutes before i decided it wasn't for me. Personally, i like to put some additional blank lines between methods. It helps me visually segregate methods, especially if i've been starring at the code for too long.
Is there a difference with iterrows?
&gt;...I'd like to reserve chaining for operations that return new values, like string processing operations... That's exactly what happens here. Each of those Pandas operations returns a new dataframe with different contents.
Why not `default.update(new)`? Looks more readable to me.
80 chars still align nicely when the editor shares the screen horizontally with shell windows in a tiling WM in a standard HD laptop. But I still ignore the pep-8 rule and disable the lint checks for those annoying 1-char-off lines.
I believe comprehensions are faster. Or from i remember of what i've read in the past.
Do you have any experience with tmux? I know it should do almost the same but I don't know the difference and would like to know whether it's worth it to dive into screen.
quantities
Ah yes! I used the csv library for faaaarrr too long. And even though I've been using pandas for a few years now, I still learn from looking things up. I did learn more by doing a short R course.
Bruh that's some next level python zen. What's the magic behind the "*" at the function declaration?
Probably way too late to this but mine is using setuptools to make personal libraries interdependent without thinking about it. No more \`sys.path.append(module\_path)\`! Close contender is using virtual environments. I'd probably class that as more essential in fact.
Default value for keyword argument for functions. That allows extending a function without breaking previous code.
Impressive
As person above said a python module can be used as a singleton
&gt;I already stated this issue previously; &gt; &gt;The developers are often in too deep &gt; &gt;. In other words, they can't see the forest from the trees. They know the package so well and all those little obscure tricks that aren't documented, but are great for some unintended use case. They don't use the package wrong, so they don't hit the errors or have those misconceptions about the package handles data that users and especially beginners do. We may be saying the same thing. I totally get that, and totally agree with it. But it doesn't disprove my point that documentation in opensource software is often poor and a major obstacle for newcomers, an obstacle which is often not made clear enough. &amp;#x200B; Like I said, I am drafting an update to some docs which I'd like to submit soon. It will be interesting to see how that goes. The process is far from straightforward (git is neither user-friendly nor accessible), and AFAIK, there is no simple way for a user to simply submit a proposal to add a few explanatory comments to the documentation - if I understand correctly , a git PR is needed, with all the complications that come with it. People who are more familiar with R tell me the problem is much worse there, because more packages are maintained by single individuals who can be not very receptive to the suggestion that their documentation might need improving.
Could you use this structure to build a custom comparator? Is it necessary to do this, so that python knows how to compare the objects?
If I didn't need functions from various classes (subclass of AnyIO.socketstream, an event manager, player database, etc) that would definitely work.

[Yes, __eq__, and here is a StackOverflow about it. ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3588776/how-is-eq-handled-in-python-and-in-what-order)
Yeah, but that's really hacky and hard to read and easy to make mistakes with. One forgotten "global" declaration and you've got a nasty bug that's hard to track down.

I mean, Ruby is basically a newer version of Perl which isn't impossible to read.
My only complaint is that `else` doesn't make any sense as the keyword for this, in a perfect world it would be `then`.
This might be a specific case but using @lru_cache if you think your function will be called multiple times with same repeated arguments. Makes your code much faster.
 vs = [] cs = [] [vs.append(p) if p[0] in "AEIOU" else cs.append(p) for p in phones] I recently used comprehension to divide a list of phoneme strings into two lists based on whether they started with a vowel or consonant. I know it's gross but it made me laugh.
Immutability, perhaps? It allows default dict to stay as it is
Since 3.4 I think (didn't check) it allows you to specify arguments that: * have a default value * can only be changed explicitely The regex trick would also work doing def match_func(text, my_regex=re.compile(r'[0-9]+')): ... but the issue is that this is callable with two arguments: *match_func("something", "bad argument")* Of course in that case it will fail when you try using the text "bad argument" as a regex, but it may cause subtle bugs especially when using tuple expansion when calling the function (I won't delve in that topic, let's just say that you may not realize that you're calling that function with two arguments). If you put a lonely star between your normal arguments and default ones the ones that are after the star must be named in order to be changed. This means that calling the function with two arguments will result in a clear error stating that you passed two arguments where one was expected. It's also a nice way to "hide" default arguments if you're writting a library and want your users not to make a mistake on the number on expected arguments.
Creating a new dict from two existing dicts : ``` a = {'k' : v , 'some_key' : some_value} b = {'l' : m , 'n' : o , 'p' : q} c = { **a , **b } #copies bith dict a and b ``` Works on only latest versions of python , but pretty cool though
OK, that must be really large files then. For me, I process the entire content in different ways so one line is not enough. I also mostly just make scripts of less than 1000 lines so keeping a text file of something like a few megabytes are not much of a problem.
There ia also breakpoint() which does the same
&gt; git is neither user-friendly nor accessible I'd say that about any version control system. Git is different, but it's better and faster than say Subversion or CVS and has far fewer unsolvable problems that those systems have. It's also much better for large scale projects with tons of branches. It's the standard in software development, so get used to it? It's 95% just terminology and then 100 commands that are useful in very specific circumstances, but you don't really need most of the time. I use Git with TortoiseGit. Basically it uses the same icons as Subversion and it has fewer features. I don't use the command line. &gt; and AFAIK, there is no simple way for a user to simply submit a proposal to add a few explanatory comments to the documentation You can edit a file entirely on Github without even downloading the project. &gt; if I understand correctly , a git PR is needed, with all the complications that come with it What are those? A pull request is quite easy to create. Again, you can do it entirely through github.
seems useful
When I first started using dunder methods I felt like a wizard. Still do.
That's the point for me. I can have 4 separate files open and reference them while coding. It makes the big picture so much easier to validate - especially if I'm working on a project with multiple languages or disciplines. I use emacs and have settings to automatically break my lines, and in languages where that isn't cleanly supported, I have hotkeys for doing so myself - which makes maintaining 80 character discipline a lot easier than any other coding environment. I honestly feel that breaking my code up for 80 has simplified the process of coding a good deal for me. I'm better at naming variables/functions and more apt to break apart code that is too complex for others to read.
A dict is mutable. I think our commands do the same.
In python doctests area great way to battle that problem. Although I think the "lies waiting to happen" argument is overused by people who don't like to document their work. If you do any sort of code review, outdated comments should be replaced as they become outdated.
This may be belying my inexperience, but LINQ has a lot more SQL-like options (eg. group by) than regular old comprehensions in Python. If memory serves, complicated comprehensions are frowned upon as being difficult to read and follow.
i like that Wing stays around that 200 meg sweet spot
Fluent Python is a book with a great chapter on this.
Thanks!
It's called overriding for those curious. I really love it too.
bad idea
Sure! Cmder is basically just ConEmu with some reasonable, but opinionated defaults. It's quite literally just a wrapper, you're still really using ConEmu. You can even directly import your ConEmu config files. See cmder.net for info about Cmder. In terms of integration with any JetBrains IDE this is officially supported now I believe. At least there's a page on the Wiki here: https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/wiki/Seamless-IntelliJ-based-Integration See here for ongoing discussion: https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/282
• else clause with for and while loops • list/tuple unpacking • list/dictionary/generator comprehension
Obviously it should be done like this: for line in data: for char in line: with open(full_file, 'a') as file_handle: file_handle.write(char)

Ah, I get it. You mean a normal variable deviation. Yeah, in Python that doesn't make a lot of sense.
&gt; making Raymond Hettinger the new BDFL i agree with the sentiment but not the BDFL title.. maybe Chief
Please explain what "make injection" and "reflectio" is and post it to r/learnpython. Have a nice day. x

No, that's impossible. Also, directories aren't _really_ files on modern filesystems. Also, /r/learnpython.
there is a good answer to this but im too lazy to find the source. if you read a scientific journal article the pages are split into 4 columns. the reason is there have been studies, by -scientists-(lol), that found the optimal width for reading such dense material.

Thanks for sharing man, I am going to give it a try and let you know once I do it, I hope in the next 4-5 hours!
Yeah, me too. Also curious if there is another/better way to do this.
Sorry for the wrong sub, and I will get right on that.
This 100%. It's less relevant these days because term windows can be wider, but widescreen monitors mean you can have two files side-by-side in your IDE (and other cases like you mention). I've learned to cleverly split almost every type of long line. The exception is if you import some complex json and you have a nested dict reference that is super long. (And in cases like that, maybe it's time to use a temporary variable to store that so you aren't typing that huge mess out every time).
I find zip most useful when iterating 2 list of the same length at the same time, so you don't have to create a nested loop.
I split arguments by line almost everywhere, makes it much easier to read IMO
I mentioned this elsewhere but a huge advantage is you can easily display two files side-by-side if they are 80 char compliant. I'm not letting all that space go to waste or anything.
I think it's even the first chapter! Such a good book.
Write small functions/methods.
so...no?
Not a tiny efficiency, but learning how to use a debugger has hugely improved my programming. Instead of guessing at the code, or putting in a million print statements, I can pick a suspicious part of my code, set a breakpoint, run my program and instantly get a ton of info (or maybe it takes a while for your program to get there, still useful): * You know whether that part of the code gets hit at all or not (you may be looking at dead code) without having to manually trace any call chains * You get the full call chain with all context of all local variables. You get way more info than you'll ever get with print statements (by definition) for far less effort * You can modify variables and then continue running, instead of having to change the variable and re-run It's so easy these days with tools like PyCharm. There's an "activation energy" to get into the habit of using a debugger instead of using print statements (I had a habit of using print statements, so it took me some time and effort to break that), but once you have it, you can go so much further so much faster.
Thanks buddy, I’ll start mine this summer and I’m planning to use python to. Some conexión peer to peer in IoT device and you have some good presentation. By best wishes buddy, well done
I can only fit around 170 character on the screen I use at word (which is 23 inches I think) and with vim line number columns and error markers 80 characters per buffer is prefect to use two buffers side by side so this is not only for screen from the last century.
Agreed. If you end up using similar params in blocks with slightly different indentation you will get a weird mix of styles, which I think makes it harder to visually parse.
Guard clauses huh? I always thought they were called early exits
Same here. There are a few cases where using a list comprehension is appropriate but for the most part they are overused, and people make them far too complicated. I think in general they tend people toward trying to put far more things on one line than should be there, which is pretty opposite the goal of readable code.
I usually dislike using lambdas and comprehension because it can make the code unreadable, but I feel like having just 1 condition allows it to still be readable - adding other conditions like all evens in the range of 10-30 and 60-80 would make it much more unreadable and taxing to read
yeah it's like newspaper columns, easy to read i go 60 chars
I feel like your example is totally readable but it's not specifically using a list comprehension either
Initially, while im learning the basics, id be using python to solve project euler math problems.
Don't run any program you don't trust. As simple as that. Doesn't matter what form they come in, or which language they're written in.
Why even use enumerate if you're only keeping track of the index and not the value? You could get the same output in a more performant way using the `range` generator in Python 3.X or `xrange` in Python 2.X
They are twice as fast according to this shitty benchmark: `from time import time` `from random import random` &amp;#x200B; `t1 = 0` `t2 = 0` &amp;#x200B; `for i in range(10000):` `t0 = time()` `l = []` `for _ in range(1000):` `l.append(random())` `t1 += time() - t0` &amp;#x200B; `for i in range(10000):` `t0 = time()` `l2 = [random() for _ in range(1000)]` `t2 += time() - t0` &amp;#x200B; `print(t1, t2)` I believe it is because append imply a lot of resizing of the list but list comprehension only python allocate the list at the end of the iterations and do more stuff at the C level.
fail
Luckily I'm the only user that sees most of my creations, tests is one thing I have literally never even looked it. It's something that I really want to have a go at, I'm working on a web scraper at the moment, I will have to have a go at implanting some tests into that.
It respects the same `#fmt off/on` comments as yapf
Here's one example https://airflow.apache.org/concepts.html#bitshift-composition
I’d say that now you should learn to always use parentheses with print statement in Python 2, because it would make easier to port your code to Python 3 at some point.
Using tqdm for progress monitoring. https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm
dict( lookma = 3, noquotes = 3, onmykeys = 2, ) putting my brackets like that too.. even with statements like return( this if that else dis if not dat else gravy ) using any() and all() have been great and what about this little trick.. instead of mylist = ['very', 'quotes', 'much', 'commas', 'etc'] mylist = 'very quotes much commas etc'.split()
I’ve tried tmux couple of years ago, and found that it becomes supper laggy when you using vertical splits, especially on low end computers, especially when something continuously print output in some of the splits.
Great practical examples, thanks for this. I was aware of all/any/next but still writing the verbose loops.
PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy/psycopg2, Flask on uwsgi and Nginx. It can take a proper beating. Depends on the hardware and config of course. I can also recommend Amazon Aurora for the db hosting. For security in Flask there is flask-login and flask-security.

This is contrived, but I've used it in situations like: for root, dnames, fnames in os.path.walk(PLUGIN_DIR): for fname in fnames: if not fname.startswith('plugin_'): continue if not fname.endswith('.py'): continue plugin = load_plugin(fname) if plugin is None: continue plugin.init()
As someone who is doing some Selenium and coding, I too have tried to summit XPATH. I hadn't thought of the dictionary idea and love it. So thanks!
Ah I never used it like that. I just want to "save my session" so I can easily start where I left off. But with a new colleague coming I might want to look at screen then...

Can you give an example of why it's bad? I've only had good experiences doing this.
I don't think it is reasonable that the population of people with serious eye problems programming on ultra-mini-laptops should drive the requirements for line-lengths...
Always use a virtual environment.
Neat. Does it require newest 3.7?

Especially nice for flags too. I'm working on a game and though I love the music, I couldn't test it and hear that all the time. I do something like game_start(...., music = True): if music: So that way when running tests on specific levels and such I just set music to False, but then never have to remember to turn it on when building.
And generator comprehension.
Thanks man! Don’t hesitate to send a PM if you ever want someone to run something by.
Python 3.7+
I’ve never liked the 80 character limit it leads to real readability issues in my opinion. So I violate it when it makes sense. The primary problem is that I like verbose variable and function names, it does take long for you to hit the 80 character limit.
This is very true but as you age you buy hardware with larger screens. I pretty much gave up on 13” and smaller screens.

um.. why?
no i deleted everything and reinstalled
Yeah I have noticed the wrapping to be pretty poor with pycharm, I'll give black a go! Cheers
Maybe 6 months ago. Also the start-up time was noticeably slow. But the general browser was slow. Each action required more time for it to be executed.
Do you have any advice on what to use as an alternative to `isinstance`?
Python 2 or 3? Only thing that springs to mind without seeing code is utf8 to ASCII. That or lines are being truncated.
I've been looking for something like this the last few days, I just couldn't find a good consolidated resource. This is perfect and I really appreciate the wealth of hyperlinks. Thanks a lot!

&gt; Poetry builds packages. pipenv is for something else entirely. &gt; &gt; This naive response proves you've never even bothered. I did bother. The problem is that the massive amount of contradicting information is astonishing. I came across poetry during a blog post about pyproject.toml and how it's needed to replace the build process. The same blog post used pipenv to manage dependencies. I don't accept blame for not understanding the mess they created. There should be one, and preferably only one obvious way to do it. &gt; Okay, cool. Tell me about all the companies who stopped using Python because they couldn't figure out package management. They didn't stop, but they made an utter and unmanageable mess. I know because I've been facing it for years. People who don't understand the difference between setup.py and requirements.txt, or that don't even bother understanding this mess and just use PYTHONPATH. &gt; The author is also deeply involved in pypa... &gt; &gt; Not really and mostly irrelevant? PSF and PYPA are separate almost entirely and the PYPA has gone more and more off the rails against the PSFs wishes. Yes, but they have a strong google visibility. When people learn about package management in python, they land on those pages, and follow them. In fact, I didn't ever hear about poetry until I came across pyproject.toml, threw my hands in the air and exclaimed "what the fuck is this thing now again?"
3.5 I looked for truncated lines, but the file contains the same number of rows as the original.
There are many reasons, but ruining OS installs or other packages is a common thing users do with pip. Especially sudo pip. In a virtualenv you are free to do whatever without breaking anything else. It's a common and useful thing to use one virtualenv per project.
That's true. I would only use a list comprehension here if I needed to do something to the items, like convert them to strings or call lower() or upper() or something. I tend to think of anything like filter, and all as list comprehensions
Yeah it's especially bad on WhatsApp Web cause they have weird obfuscated class names for elements and they change every update so my XPaths rely heavily on page structure and they are,,,, so ugly
Python2 is deprecated in a little over half a year! If you're not migrated yet, you might start running into trouble.
I would prefer first one for a small app. But, if you need a large number of objects and api endpoints, you may benefit from flask addons like flask-restplus (for api) and flask-alchemy for db, in which case you will be closer to OO solution (not so compact but better structured).
I've always struggled with this function. It expects a SQLAlchemy engine, and doesn't take a Pyodbc type connection. You know any way around this? Because it would make my code a lot cleaner if I could get it working
Well, I often have multiple files open next to each other on the same screen.
Thanks so much for replying. I was thinking the same. My app will be somewhat big but wouldn't call it large. The idea is to get into the habit of OO programming and best practices. 😊
"is" checks if it's the same pointer in memory, so maybe yes and maybe no. but 1000000 == 1_000_000
Things that come to mind: 1. Encoding 2. White space removal (between fields, before and after commas, etc) 3. White space changes - spaces to tabs. If every single group of spaces is changed to tabs it could definitely make a difference
Probably not. Does requires 3.5, due to some of the traceback stuff, I would assume.
Another bonus that f-strings are faster than .format
Does not matter. The really knowledge is about the programming part - and learning that will be your next goal, and it will be a long process. What ever language you use to express your programming thoughts does not matter - learning a new language to use it if you know programming already, is trivial.
Lol I'm 25 and this is already me.
Nobody has the time to do it, and companies hire you anyway exactly because nobody has the time to do it, and who actually has the time to do it is too junior to access those positions.

Change your title when you post there as well. You aren't having a pycharm issue at all. This sounds like it is entirely about pyinstaller.
Another possibility is that the csv.writer is only using quote encapsulation when commas are present in a string.
lazy_property decorators. I've both written my own version of this code and also found similar concepts elsewhere. def lazy_property(func): """This decorator acts like a :func:`property` decorator on the first call to `func`, on which it stores the result and subsequent calls to `func` return the stored result """ attribute = '_cache_' + function.__name__ @property @functools.wraps(func) def prop(self): if not hasattr(self, attribute): setattr(self, attribute, func(self)) return getattr(self, attribute) return prop Recently though I've not used this code and instead used the standard library to accomplish the same thing... @property @functools.lru_cache() def func(*args, **kwargs): pass # impl. details...
Fair enough, but I'm not as strict or relevant as Guido.
Just out of curiosity, what is the alternative to pure functions? Is it having the function operate on global variables? Or having a method that modifies anything self.___?
Oh man. I love that use of next. TIL . . . . &amp;#x200B; thanks!
the companies that 'dont have time to do it' are the ones you dont want to work for
 &gt;&gt;&gt; import re &gt;&gt;&gt; print(re.sub('x', r'\\r\\n', 'x')) \r\n You mean?
I used `defaultdict` and `Counter` for a long time until I discovered `dict.setdefault`, e.g. letter_counts = {} for char in text: letter_counts.setdefault(char, letter_counts.get(char, 0) + 1)
Not implementing things for budget reasons is always ok. Not communicating it, is not.
Just look on winapi.

I'd use the first one
&gt; I did bother. The problem is that the massive amount of contradicting information is astonishing. I came across poetry during a blog post about pyproject.toml and how it's needed to replace the build process. The same blog post used pipenv to manage dependencies. I don't accept blame for not understanding the mess they created. &gt; There should be one, and preferably only one obvious way to do it. Which proves you didn't bother. Stop passing the buck. A blog post shouldn't inform you, that's a source 3+ levels down the chain at worst, a shitty secondary source at best. Use a primary source: https://poetry.eustace.io PEP 517/518 provide a resource in the use of pyproject.toml, a file that is meant to replace the build and management process, and allows external tools to arbitrarily extend said process. Poetry does uses the document, and arbitrarily extends the functionality by adding dependency management. As well as a few pieces of access to the poetry internals to create and extend the dependency management system. &gt; They didn't stop, but they made an utter and unmanageable mess. I know because I've been facing it for years. People who don't understand the difference between setup.py and requirements.txt, or that don't even bother understanding this mess and just use PYTHONPATH, with all the associated consequences. I've met no person who doesn't understand the difference of setup.py/requirements.txt/uses PYTHONPATH in a weird hacky way. This is indicative of personal experience, of which we differ, but neither of our experiences can prove the case for the set. There very well may be a problem, however saying there definitely is is a call to the unknown. &gt; Yes, but they have a strong google visibility. When people learn about package management in python, they land on those pages, and follow them. In fact, I didn't ever hear about poetry until I came across pyproject.toml, threw my hands in the air and exclaimed "what the fuck is this thing now again?" And thats the problem. What is good and standardized may not be popular. Pipenv had popularity due to the authors self admitted great marketing skills. However more and more users of pipenv are slowly realizing that it has major problems, biggest being extremely slow dependency resolvers. Some people have had their dependency resolution take literal hours, and switching to poetry made it go down to 5 minutes at most. PEP 517/518 existed before pipenv, and poetry's precursors by the same authors also existed before pipenv. The author just isn't well known and doesn't force feed marketing everywhere unlike Kenneth Reitz, who also had connections to the PYPA team. When Reitz had his tantrum on this subreddit there was a major controversy because pipenv was promoted as an official tool by the PYPA even though it went against previously agreed PEP documents and made no mention of the (in many people's eyes', better) alternatives. &gt; Honestly. One has to take a massive time investment in understanding these things. They can't change and force professionals to throw away their competence every six months. If they do, at least that the provide a migration guide and "this is obsolete, do that from now on" guide. And I fully agree. I hope in all my heart pyproject.toml will be the end of the mess, and people will do a final switxh from pipenv to poetry as they keep having problems.
I like that way a lot too! So in my case, ``` letter_word_dict = dict() for word in text: letter_word_dict.setdefault(word[0], letter_word_dict.get(word[0], list()).append(word) ```
For any reason other than it being quicker to write?
It's easier to read for me
 &gt; Which proves you didn't bother. Stop passing the buck. A blog post shouldn't inform you, that's a source 3+ levels down the chain at worst, a shitty secondary source at best. Use a primary source: https://poetry.eustace.io Oh I am sorry if I didn't bother to read the hundredth tab on my browser that may or may not be relevant in 3 months' time. I am also sorry that I picked wrong choice of the day in pipenv that because the author is a weirdo, then we are not going to use it. &gt; I've met no person who doesn't understand the difference of setup.py/requirements.txt/uses PYTHONPATH in a weird hacky way. I can introduce you to at least 20 in my company alone. And the reason why it's like that, it's because it's not clear in the documentation itself. People see the thing, wonder why it's duplicated, and they just slap the same stuff in both, even go as far as read one from the other. Let's accept it: everybody is over his fucking head with everything. RTFM is not a justification. If we have to RTFM we only do that, because the amount of documentation and stuff that changes all the time is simply TOO MUCH to leave any available time to get anything done. People code by copying and pasting what they find online. and that's not unprofessionalism. it's because there's no fucking time to do otherwise. &gt; And thats the problem. What is good and standardized may not be popular. Pipenv had popularity due to the authors self admitted great marketing skills. However more and more users of pipenv are slowly realizing that it has major problems, biggest being extremely slow dependency resolvers. Some people have had their dependency resolution take literal hours, and switching to poetry made it go down to 5 minutes at most. SAT solver? &gt; PEP 517/518 existed before pipenv, and poetry's precursors by the same authors also existed before pipenv. The fact that a PEP exists does not mean it will be implemented. &gt; The author just isn't well known and doesn't force feed marketing everywhere unlike Kenneth Reitz, who also had connections to the PYPA team. When Reitz had his tantrum on this subreddit there was a major controversy because pipenv was promoted as an official tool by the PYPA even though it went against previously agreed PEP documents and made no mention of the (in many people's eyes', better) alternatives. Ok so you are telling me that PyPA and everything it produces is stuff python programmers shouldn't bother to read? Do you really hope to stop the tide with your hands? Everywhere I go people learn by first hit on google. If there's a PEP, they don't give a fuck. &gt; And I fully agree. I hope in all my heart pyproject.toml will be the end of the mess, and people will do a final switxh from pipenv to poetry as they keep having problems. I seriously doubt it. Personally, I don't give a damn. I just want one, so I can code, instead of wasting my time learning how to even get started.
The companies you talk about don't exist.
You shouldn't be using `is` to check for equality anyway.
Using a dict as a switch-case or dispatcher. Store functions in a dict and call them with any hashable object. event_handlers[event_type](*event_args)
huh? there are plenty of companies with dedicated DS teams that realized 'we should invest in this' not 'im too busy for this'.
Hey thanks so much! &amp;#x200B; I'll talk to my group about it! Sounds like we have a lot of options!
Yes
Once you've learned one language then it's a lot easier to learn another. Developers generally have knowledge of a few languages - I don't know if you know any html or javascript but learning those you could pair them with python for web app development using a framework like flask or django. Python is very forgiving in a lot of ways - if you wanted to understand more or what's going on under the hood then something like java or c++ might help you with that. If you're enjoying learning to program and want to make a career of it then consider taking a university computer science course - there's a lot on them besides coding and it's an awful lot easier to get hired with a qualification than without one. I started with a really good course on edx (mitx 6.00.1x) and i went on to do a university course, I'm nearly finished and I've a job lined up for June. So it's definitely doable :) Happy programming.
Pint is genius for this
tldr: take statistics 101.
the 80 char line limit allows me to have the file browsing pane open, 2 columns of code and a terminal in a FHD monitor. Also allows me to have 1 column of code and a terminal in my 768p Lenovo X230.
Isn't that a common thing in most languages?
``` d = {“name”: “Jerry”, “age”: 25} def create_person(name: str, age: int) -&gt; Person: # do stuff create_person(**d) ```
`@lru_cache` from `functools` maybe?
Anything by "Uncle Bob" Martin is worth watching/reading. Search for "Bob Martin Clean Code" on YouTube, and you will find a few gems.
I’ve only ever seen/used else only if there was a finally block. If there’s no finally, then there really isn’t a point in else is there? In your example `do_stuff_with(foo)` really should be outside the try block, not in an else.
I think all languages that I have used have operator overloading.
There are 3 different quote characters in Python. If the string might be surrounded by any of them, then you need to address that. You can use endswith and startswith to simplify things https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_endswith.asp I also suggest /r/learnpython for this type of question.
Type the following in a python prompt and take note. `&gt;&gt;&gt;import this`
Anything that causes a side effect, so yes operations on global/class variables, but also interacting with a database, doing I/O, manipulating files, etc.
read the sidebar /r/learnpython read THAT sidebar don't post screenshots of code what version of python are you using? etc
you know, I started with Java then went to c# and then to c++. And I must say, when I got to python, it was incredibly easy. Now I know how the system works under the hood. However, data science isn't really my thing because I'm not interested in Statistics. The point is, learn more languages and eventually, you'll get an idea that might actually be useful. Also, I hear AWS is in demand for python programmers.
All of your points boil down to a few things 1. I need to program and don't want to 2. I don't know or won't do the standard things that prevent most of these things from being a problem because (1) 3. I refuse to learn how to program even though I have to program.
I'm one of the core developers of pandas and posts like this are incredibly demoralizing. In a vacuum I usually brush off these types of things but I'm also a human being with other things going on in my life, and sometimes everything combined just makes non-constructive criticism like this very depressing. &amp;#x200B; To add some perspective, pandas is entirely maintained by volunteers, with the exception of one core dev who gets to devote a small portion of their fulltime job to pandas maintenance. I do most of my pandas coding at night after work, which has been 10+ hour days lately, and I'll regularly skip my lunch break to get in some extra bug fixes and to triage issues. I've had one week of vacation from my job in the last two years and I spent it working on pandas. I get zero support from my employer in regards to my open source contributions, and have even been criticized by my manager for "spending too much time on pandas" outside of work in my own free time. I've never received any compensation for my work on pandas (nor do I expect any) and developing pandas has actually ended up costing me money. I don't mean this in a nebulous "opportunity cost" way - I've spent money out of pocket on things specifically to help me develop pandas. &amp;#x200B; Frankly, I spend a lot of time trying to make pandas a useful and helpful tool for users to bypass a lot of ugly data munging that by and large they don't enjoy doing. Most of the feedback I get is non-constructive criticism and vaguely insulting. I'm sorry that the documentation "simply sucks", that there are bugs which are "utter lunacy", that we change the API to make it more consistent/usable in the long term, and that we've confined you to something that's merely the "least worst tool". Hopefully someone more competent and dedicated than me will come along and freely release something that's actually good. Sigh, I guess this is a sign of burnout and I need to take a break from open source for a while...

And how did you infer these pearls of wisdom, if I may dare ask? I am most interested in understanding your thought process. &amp;#x200B; Let's see. I complained that the docs of some functions have undocumented features. Is having undocumented features something that should be applauded? &amp;#x200B; I reported an interview with the lead developer of Matplotlib talking about the problems with the docs in matplotlib. I then mentioned I am drafting some updates to a piece of documentation, which is exactly in the spirit of opensource. Is any of this a sign I "refuse to learn"? &amp;#x200B; I complained about a gigantic and still almost undocumented bug in pandas, which can cause one row in a column date to be mm-dd-yyyy and another to be dd-mm-yyyy. Is this soemthing to be applauded? Does raising this show I don't want to program? Does saying that this can invalidate years of scripts and analyses mean I "refuse to learn"? &amp;#x200B; I said that finding an answer for a Matlab question tends to be much quicker and less frustrating than for open-source software. Again, how does this show I refuse to learn? &amp;#x200B; Please, do enlighten me.
I’m working my way through a reverse engineering course and this makes me happy.

Sorry if its not for you, I understand that you know how to install which is amazing, but others may not.
&gt;Let's see. I complained that the docs of some functions have undocumented features. Is having undocumented features something that should be applauded? ​Some of that does exist, but your example (utf8/latin1) is **right in the docs**, so you either can't read, didn't read, or downright ignored. &gt;I reported an interview with the lead developer of Matplotlib talking about the problems with the docs in matplotlib. I then mentioned I am drafting some updates to a piece of documentation, which is exactly in the spirit of opensource. Is any of this a sign I "refuse to learn"? Good, you are helping. That's a start. However, you haven't learned anything about managing library versions and even argued about the suggestion to fix your version in requirements.txt to prevent issues when upgrading. You never responded to any of the suggestions to writing tests to make sure things work - are you writing tests or are you just ignoring that part of development entirely? You are also incredibly standoffish and seem to believe you are completely right about everything despite showing many signs of being far from polished in your development skills. That right there is a big put off and a huge sign of someone who isn't looking for solutions but rather venting.
&gt; SyntaxError: invalid syntax That message means the interpreter is very confused, and it's usually caused by a missing bracket. Just double check everything, remember that spaces matter, and please use /r/learnpython.
Here's a sneak peek of /r/learnpython using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/top/?sort=top&amp;t=year) of the year! \#1: [Why study programming when you can just play an RPG?](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/aw0au0/why_study_programming_when_you_can_just_play_an/) \#2: [Al Sweigart, author of the legendary 'Automate The Boring Stuff' book (and many others) now streams beginner-friendly live coding on twitch!](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/ao3zq2/al_sweigart_author_of_the_legendary_automate_the/) \#3: [Just spent 2 hours to automate joining csv files saving hundreds of hours a year](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/a085dx/just_spent_2_hours_to_automate_joining_csv_files/) ---- ^^I'm ^^a ^^bot, ^^beep ^^boop ^^| ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove ^^| [^^Contact ^^me](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sneakpeekbot) ^^| [^^Info](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/) ^^| [^^Opt-out](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/comments/afd0dd/blacklist/)
This is relevant to far more than Python, too. In ES6/React/JSX land I use this pattern: &amp;#x200B; \`\`\` render = () =&gt; ( &lt;FooComponent prop prop prop="a prop"&gt; &lt;Child1 /&gt; &lt;Child2 /&gt; &lt;/FooComponent&gt; ) \`\`\` &amp;#x200B; Because my brain is trained to grok html like syntax based on shared columns. The alternative is a little harder to skim/grok: &amp;#x200B; \`\`\` render = () =&gt; &lt;FooComponent prop prop prop="a prop"&gt; &lt;Child1 /&gt; &lt;Child2 /&gt; &lt;/FooComponent&gt; \`\`\`
Ah, I haven't come across that concept before, I like it
Why do I have to keep blocking these stupid bots?
Hopefully you also read the point about entitlement, which I intentionally put in bold? I am enormously grateful to developers like you who dedicate their time to the opensource community. I truly am. The point is not that. The point is that the documentation for commercial software like Matlab is incredibly better and finding an answer to a Matlab question is incredibly easier, quicker and less frustrating. Maybe this is not an issue for the many more talented users than me, but for me and a number of people I know it is a big issue. &amp;#x200B; My point was that the quality of the opensource documentation tends to be overestimated, and the difficulties arising from such documentation underestimated. There is a lot of hype on Python and R and data science etc. I don't , however, see a lot of clarity on how finding an answer for an opensource question may be incredibly longer and more frustrating. This applies in general: to Matlab vs Python, to Word vs LaTeX, etc. That's all. &amp;#x200B; Did you read my part about different date formats in a date column? I can think of many managers who would have gone totally ballistic at something like this, and would have used it as a reason to only use tested commercial software. Can you really blame them? Again, I am not saying users are entitled to anything - I am just saying it's a factor to bear in mind. I know a person who did all her ETL processing in Alteryx, before analysing the data in Python. Had she used Python to import and cleanse the raw data, with that kind of bug, years of analyses could have proven to be totally off. &amp;#x200B; Like I said I am drafting some changes to a piece of documentation and I hope I'll be able to submit it soon.
Iterate through your input using enumerate. Use .isalpha() to check for special character, if it is store that index value. Add the special character where needed for final key.
In case anyone tries this, you need two sets of square brackets: df[['col1', 'col2']].mean() With only one set, you are asking for a single column labelled with the tuple `('col1', 'col2')` - when really what you want to do is pass a list of labels. Also worth noting that `df[['col1', 'col2']]` is itself just a pandas `DataFrame`, so what's really happening here is that you are selecting from one `DataFrame` to make another. There are many more ways to select, for anyone interested: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html
In this specific case since it's a `sys.exit`, it should be outside the try, but if it didn't exit there and if it looked like this: try: foo = json.loads(user_data) except ValueError: log.warning(f'user passed bad json: {user_data!r}') else: user.save_profile(user_data) ... then there is a point to the else. It only runs if the try blocked worked without running into an exception. We don't want to save the hypothetical user profile here if it's bad json, only if it's good. It being in the `else` ensures that.
If you mean only double quotes, much simpler to strip them if they're there and add them unconditionally: strings = '"This str had quotes"', 'This str had none' for s in strings: print('"{}"'.format(s.strip('"'))) "This str had quotes" "This str had none"
Less than a million users, no need for ultra-responsive speed, no regulatory problems --&gt; absolutely everythings going to be fine.

&gt;First off, 90% of your complaints have nothing to do with python. They have to do with very specific python libraries. This isn't a post about python, it's mainly a post about pandas and matplotlib You evidently didn't read my post. It's titled "Python for data science".Not "Python as a language regardless of the applications". Can you really do much data science in Python without pandas and matplotlib? &amp;#x200B; I mentioned pandas.read\_csv ; as far as I can see the [docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html) don't mention which engine uses utf-8 and which doesn't. There's a link to this [page](https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings), which doesn't seem the clearest, either. &amp;#x200B; If the analysis is only a very small script I don't typically use testing. For larger scripts and programs, yes. However, it would have never occurred to me to think I should have tested whether two rows of the same data column can have different formats - the mere concept was something so inconceivable I would have never though it possible. &amp;#x200B; What suggestion did I argue against? I asked for a clarification. &amp;#x200B; You are also absolutely right that I am far from polished in my development skills. Like I said, I am not a professional developer. My job is not being a developer. I use Python SQL and other tools to help me with some analyses that other people in my line of work either don't do or do in Excel. So what? I never said "I am an accomplished developer yet I find Python obscure". Far, far far from it! My not being a professional developer doesn't make poor documentation any better, though. Nor does it make the bug about date formats any less serious. I mean, the lead developer of Matplotlib can criticise the documentation, but if I do, I am standoffish etc etc??
process.run() While True: pass compared to: process.join() Turned my script from 100% CPU usage to 0.1% on my raspberry pi.
&gt;I use Python SQL and other tools to help me with some analyses that other people in my line of work either don't do or do in Excel. You are coding in a professional sense. That means you need to act as such or don't fucking program. People with your attitude struggle with nearly everything due to their own mistakes. &gt;You evidently didn't read my post. It's titled "Python for data science".Not "Python as a language regardless of the applications". Can you really do much data science in Python without pandas and matplotlib? More of you whiny, yadda yadda. If python for data science is only using pandas and matplotlib then my point stands - you are complaining about some libraries. Not python. Basically you have two actual complaints - you can't find docs for things, and dates in a sub 1.0 library have a bug. Big woop-de-do. Every other complaint is your own fault. Get better. Fix your versions. Code around your date problem by converting your source data. If you are going to program as part of your profession, then do it professionally. Don't just half-ass it and then bitch that you shot yourself in the foot because you didn't know what you are doing.
maybe obv but a few things that come to mind python -i to drop into interpreter after script for debugging python -m http.server to host a directory quickly python -m json.tool to format json list(set(myList)) for quick list dedup - if there’s a better way let me know!
*YOOOOOOOOOO!!!!* It's your **2nd Cakeday** Mohkale77! ^(hug)
It's not only gross but also quite inefficient. Since you're using a list comprehension, a list is being built in memory which will, in this case, contain all phonemes starting with a vowel and the `None` object instead of all phonemes starting with a consonant. Depending on your data size, building this list could take substantial time. Generally speaking, it's bad form to perform side effects in list comprehensions. Just do this one with a loop instead.
Yeah this is just a pet peeve of mine. I've been writing python scripts as utilities for 20+ years and I'm annoyed that I have to start using parens for no visible benefit. I understand all the edge cases very well they just never ever apply to me.

Some of us like to have two or three files open side by side, and shorter lines make that much more practical. Its fine if you prefer longer lines as a matter of taste, but it's silly to pretend a preference for shorter lines is based on nostalgia for obsolete technology.
Please elaborate on that
Please elaborate on this
I was hoping for a more mature discussion. Shame. I said at the very beginning I was talking about python for data science and the libraries used for that - not base Python in abstract. Yet you felt the need to reiterate this point multiple times. Do you even read before replying? It's not YOUR point, it's something I clarified at the very beginning! What is your point, though? It's not clear to me. Are you saying that documentation for open source is on par with that for commercial software? Or that it isn't but it doesn't matter? I do use opensource. But I am realistic about its pros and cons. Eg I use LaTeX for large complex documents for which Word wouldn't be appropriate. But I never say that LaTeX is easy. When people ask me about it, I always warn them the learning curve is steep and there will be moments they struggle to find answers to seemingly banal questions. The Python libraries I mentioned are very similar. Why such an aggressive reaction? What have I said that is so offensive or incorrect? Why are you getting so worked up about some issues which even the lead developer of Matplotlib acknowledged?
Hi! What is the error you are getting?
I used this so often in [https://github.com/Dentosal/python-sc2](https://github.com/Dentosal/python-sc2) , what can i use instead of this?
Yes you are right, they should be more honest on what they offer.
no error i just do not understand what value i need to put in for the question What input will be successfully validated against this program
\`\`\`python import pdb; pdb.set\_trace() \`\`\` This line pauses the program and enters an interactive debugger to introspect objects while they're working.
`10**7` :P
My gut bike-shed-painting instinct is that `10**7` is cleaner. In contrast, `1e7` brings up terrible memories of working with PHP.
Listen, you are basically whining about how you refuse to use the tools in front of you to avoid the issues you are complaining about. Only two of your complaints (documentation, and a **single bug**) are about things you aren't directly causing for yourself. You refuse to discuss these things and continue to harp on how you aren't a professional programmer. You are using code in a professional sense. Either learn to do so professionally or stop doing it. I deal with people like you all the time and you are very unpleasant people to deal with. All complaints, only enough knowledge to be dangerous but not enough to understand the problems they are facing, but you insist on using things professionally that you don't understand. This isn't aggressive, it's just a bit judgmental. If you consider this aggressive I have to assume you grew up receiving participation trophies and not keeping score.
Tools like mypy can be smart and analyse proper type annotations, then tell you about bugs that might occur from misusing types.
Yea I understand it doesn't make sense for larger APIs. I program for data science, so it works when writing algorithms.
Yeah! So, I was working on optimizing my time series library (pending open source from corporate) and was trying to speed up reading the data from disk. After profiling it because obvious that all the functions that were using `isinstance(..)` to determine what type of metric was stored were very slow. Since all of my data types inherit from a base type called `Entry` I was able to add class attributes to the base type and check those instead of checking each specific Entry's type. It ends up looking like this, class Measure(Entry): _type_char = 'M' _type_name = 'Measure' class Sentinel(Entry): _type_char = 'X' _type_name = 'Sentinel' _is_mapping = False _is_sentinel = True class Snapshot(Entry): _type_char = 'S' _type_name = 'Snapshot' _is_mapping = True Now, instead of branching on `isinstance(..)` you can say, type_ = entry.type if type_ = Entry.MEASUREMENT: ... This only bit me in one place where duck typing / type casting got me. I have an `if..else` tree, ordered by most likely so we can break sooner when we hit the condition. Unfortunately the most likely scenario was a boolean `True or False or None`, but that doesn't work if the next most likely was a number, &gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(True, int) True After profiling this was the most optimized for my use case, ret = fn(*args, **kwargs) if ret is None or isinstance(ret, bool): self.event('%s:%s' % (n, str(ret))) elif isinstance(ret, NUMBER_TYPES): self.measure(n, ret) else: try: self.data(n, dict(ret.items())) except (AttributeError, TypeError, ValueError): # Attribute: ret isn't a dict-like object, no .items # TypeError: ret has .items but cannot convert to mapping # ValueError: invalid key/value in the items pass return ret Replacing all my calls to `isinstance` made my module 4x faster without changing any of the underlying logic.
Hypothesis &amp;#x200B; If you want to develop with Pandas, I highly recommend adopting it for its testing framework. &amp;#x200B; It will save a lot of headaches.
oh interesting i never needed to preserve order but this is cool nonetheless thanks
The `.get()` method on dicts.
It only gets better!
For interactive and experimental data science, try Juypyter Notebook, Google Colabatory. Jetbrains also do a similar product, but I've forgotten it's name. Got working on your laptop, get Jetbrains' Pycharm Community Edition. It's got a really good integrated python debugger.
&gt; The most tricky part is the optional second argument, which is used if there isn't a match found in the iterator provided. Going off on a tangent here, `dict.get(key, default_if_not_found)` is very handy.
It is still beyond me how I would refuse to use the tools in front of me. Or what I would allegedly refuse to discuss. Care to explain? it was clear you attacked me without reading my post, because you hadn't read that I very explicitly wrote about how the post was about python for data science and therefore some data science libraries. You will forgive me for wondering what else you didn't read or understand. I made the point that some statistical libraries are poorly implemented and I linked to a technical discussion on that. How is that something I am causing to myself? Please clarify. I made the point that certain data import and export tasks are much much faster in R. How am I causing this to myself? Please clarify. In this case, I tend to use a combination of R and Python, by the way, to make the most of both. All complaints? How is drafting updates to the documentation a sign of "all complaints"???
The former has better tooling.
"wall" "height" and "cm" do not have the same relationship to the value stored, and as such should NOT by typographed similarly.
&gt;It is still beyond me how I would refuse to use the tools in front of me. Or what I would allegedly refuse to discuss. Care to explain? You have several complaints about libraries changing APIs. The announced and documented this in a way that none of it was unknown. Yet you still didn't use a simple version in a requirements.txt file to prevent this from being an issue for you. You blindly used whatever version and suffered for it. &gt;it was clear you attacked me without reading my post, because you hadn't read that I very explicitly wrote about how the post was about python for data science and therefore some data science libraries. You will forgive me for wondering what else you didn't read or understand. Can't help it if you feel attacked by being disagreed with, get thicker skin. I very much read the article and it was not appropriately titled based on it's content. It was also full of complaints you could have avoided with minimal effort and knowledge. It bothers me - because if someone entering into using python for data science read your post they would be greatly misled and misinformed. &gt;I made the point that some statistical libraries are poorly implemented and I linked to a technical discussion on that. How is that something I am causing to myself? Please clarify. Pick your tools accordingly. If the library is poorly implemented for you then don't use it. Simple. &gt;I made the point that certain data import and export tasks are much much faster in R. How am I causing this to myself? Please clarify. In this case, I tend to use a combination of R and Python, by the way, to make the most of both. Use R then. Right tool for the job. If you are having all these problems you can't handle in python then don't use it. Granted, millions of people are using it just fine without suffering these issues - indicating that you are the problem. &gt;All complaints? How is drafting updates to the documentation a sign of "all complaints"??? You are doing one thing to handle one of your problems with python for data science. Doesn't negate all the other things you could have avoided entirely.
It doesn't matter, its primary feature is the fact it's a variable in Python code and that completely defines the nature of its shape. It's like tab instead of spaces: one could spare a lot of bytes, but nobody cares. If a human can't comprehend what's behind meaning of *wall\_height\_cm* then someone really f\*\*\*\* up giving that human a reading code job.
Better: list_a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] even = filter(lambda x: not x % 2, list_a) I've just started using map and filter more, and that above is classic filter use case. FYI, returns a generator... If you want a list, just add a list() call.
I 100% agree and so does Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky but nothing is done about it. I say this based off the stack overflow podcast which is absolutely amazing but wth this happens constantly but I guess as long as the site remains the #1 Google hit with the answer you are looking for ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ even if that first link takes you to a stack exchange site where the first comment says to Google it.

I don't agree with you, and I happen to think that YOUR opinion tends to be the conventional wisdom. I frequently hear programmers, especially from other languages, hate on list comprehensions. I think they don't like that there are two ways to write loops to gather data in python. I tend to follow a principle of, "if it can be written as a list comprehension, it should." List comprehensions and for loops are not interchangable: any list comprehension can be written as a for loop, but not all for loops can be written as a list comprehension. If your loop is simple enough that it can be written as a comprehension, it should be so that it is clear to everyone that this is a single loop over one data structure doing one operation for each element (I call these "simple" loops). This allows you to more easily reason about lines of code that contain list comprehensions. I have personally found that by doing list comprehensions everywhere possible, it has nudged me to make my algorithms simpler and linear. When I see a loop that is almost simple (can almost be written as a comprehension), I tend to ask myself why. Is it necessary that this is more complex than a simple loop? Often the answer is no, it was only done that way...just because. Does my results gathering loop NEED to be the same loop that displays the results to the user? No, they can be two sequential comprehensions and hey, now I've taken a step toward separation of concerns. It also makes asymptotic algorithmic analysis easy. List comprehensions run in O(n) time as long as you're not calling a function inside that does more iteration or have multiple "for" statements. Granted, this is easy in python in general, but I think list comprehensions make it 5% easier because its syntax requires simple loops.
Julia is wonderful for expressing linear algebra
You may spare 6 bytes (utf8) for every indentation made (chr(9) : chr(32) + chr(32) + chr(32) + chr(32)).
Proper use of decorators and descriptors. Both of these have taken all my code to the next level. Decorators also improved my command line api's significantly too.
Another big benefit of doing it that way is to prove that your tests don't have interdependencies... which is a huge no-no for reproducibility and long term maintenance. Nothing more frustrating than tests that suddenly start failing because you re-ordered them and realizing someone had some hard dependencies between tests.
If I remember correctly, when you run with --lf &amp; the last test suite all passed, it'll run everything. Quick example: 10 passed, 5 failed. 5 failed. 5 passed. 15 passed.
You're right, I wasn't paying attention. Like I said I'm very new to this.
&gt; There used to be a school of thought saying that it was good to have exactly one return statement in each function. Nuts to that. One theory I've seen is that it was something of a cargo-culted mutation of or a good principle back from assembly-esque-days, where every function should ~~goto~~ return *to* only one particular return-site. (Which nowadays is implicit and automatic in many languages.)

CTRL + ALT + K and PyCharm does the rest
Yes - there are tools (such as `mypy`) that can automatically check the first form for consistency, but not for the second.
&gt;Using a for-loop is not pythonic and would only be useful if people on your team are new to python. I'll just have to disagree on this part. A loop structure is almost always going to better illustrate what's actually going on.
Better to use `typing.get_type_hints(greet)` - that will resolve forward references, and work with PEP563 postponed evaluation.
My god, this is amazing. Thanks so much for posting this tip. I had thought pandas was mutually exclusive with PEP 8, but this makes it a piece of cake.
Nobody gives a fuck.
More precisely, any argument after a `*` can only be passed as a keyword argument. `def f(*, x): ...` can only be called as `f(x=...)`, but `f()` or `f(1)` would both be an error. Super useful for designing stable APIs, and making it easier to read callers!

But not everyone can go directly to 3.6 unfortunately, lots of people are stuck on 3.5 since it's the default version on LTS releases of a lot of popular linux distros so it will be around for a while.
Have you used [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) at all? I found it a while ago and it makes testing way less tedious (and more frustrating, because it finds so many bugs).
In the context of this example, a for-loop is not pythonic. The work is trivial a for-loop would be the worst choice for this code. filter &gt; list comp &gt; for-loop &gt; while loop

Huh! I haven’t heard that before, but it would make sense.
Python 3.6 was released in December 2016. Do you suggest that any code base or language older than two years should be considered outdated or redundant?
rebases and such benefit from shorter lines tremendously
I haven't tried that, it looks odd to me. I can't tell if I prefer it over the classic style, with respect to line count it's basically the same but the order and indentation is all that's different. Will have to give it a go tomorrow!
I've certainly done enough comprehensions that ended up requiring more logic later that demanded multiple lines. Or made something incomprehensible and 120 chars long which I left and then slapped myself for later as well. At this point I restrict myself on these pretty hard. I still use them but yeah.
Yes. All software is an extra attack vector. Install java, flash, python, Adobe reader, word, Firefox, gedit, it doesn't matter. Practically, though, you don't need to do anything other than exercising general computing wisdom. You know.

I find that having a larger project to work on really helps with clarifying what you know and what you don’t. A really classic project I like to complete when I am learning a new programming language is to implement an IRC server and client. It is in depth enough to where you’ve got to understand how the language handles various types of I/O, but it’s a simple enough spec to where it’s not going to take forever to complete.
Flask is fine until you need to have more complex user context. If you cache or LB with nginx, the query rate is not that much of a problem.

In Python it goes much further than operator overloading though. You also have all the built-in function overloading (e.g. `len()`), and implementing a class with the right interface, it automatically works with the huge standard library of Python. Like, implementing an `__iter__` doesn't *just* allow you to do `for item in thing` but let's you pass your object into *any* function which takes an iterable.
Thanks very much I’ll check it out
Just wanted to give some nitty-gritty details: An "is" check will work for two literal numbers e.g. `100000 is 100_000`. It will not work for a variable and a literal e.g. . . . x = 100_000 x is 100000 The exception is for small integers [-5, 256] which, for some efficiency reasons, are given a predefined cache location. (I don't believe this is guaranteed--it just happens to be true). So, you get . . . a = 256 b = 257 y = -5 z = -6 a is 256 // true b is 257 // false y is -5 // true z is -6 // false print(id(a), id(256)) // Same print(id(b), id(257)) // different print(id(y), id(-5)) // Same print(id(z), id(-6)) // different That said though, you should definitely not use "is" to check equality. It will return true if the two item's object ids are the same--which will happen if you directly compare number literals (e.g. 100000 and 100_000) which is about as useful as saying `x is x`. It will also work for small integers because they are pre-assigned objects and a variable will refer to the existing id just as the number itself will. But there is absolutely no reason to do something like that or to expect that that will work.

I've been a professional developer for almost 4 years and I've only recently started using them. Both map and filter are super useful replacements for a list comprehension. I'll also pass on a tip from a co-worker... If you don't need to index or transfer a sequence, a generator expression is often a better solution than another list.
You need to be as comfortable developing in Python as you are with tying your shoelaces. Most of the work in machine learning comes down to knowing what exact steps your files needs to do, what kinds of topologies you'll be implementing, and really using your programming skills as an extension to what your machine learning process flow needs to accomplish. The most important skills: -Being comfortable importing and working with 3rd party code you didn't write Nontrivial skills: -Can you omfortably call every method within a machine learning library; can you read the documentation and learn the parts needed for a specific task rather than hastily copying code you don't understand? -Can you work with file and I/O operations for working with over a GB of training data and without loading all of it into memory? -Can you dedicate at least two weeks to a month to learn about your machine learning topology before you start writing code? Don't Forget About: -Learning how to prepare training data, evaluation data, and validation data -Any hardware drivers for parallelizing events on GPU
That's the only time I really use this
 from contextlib import redirect_stdout with open(filename, 'w') as f, redirect_stdout(f): # Anything that normally prints will write to a file I do a decent amount of code generation with Python, this allows me to write print statements throughout the code and redirect all of it at the end, rather than adding `file=f` to all the `print`s.

No, I'm saying that if you're still actively working on a codebase that's still based on Python2, you should migrate it to Python3. If you're on Python3, going from, say, 3.4 to 3.7 should be trivial.

I kind of finished making a text based game where you manage a tavern, some random events happen and you can choose from some options, like improving your tavern or hiring some adventurers. Since I really enjoyed the journey from the beginning to the "final" release, I'm now using a game engine so I can port it to Android, since using Kivy didn't really appeal me. It's been a lot of help, I started without knowing how to use lists, dictionaries, classes, and some other useful things and now I feel like I can get a lot more stuff done efficiently and with less code! And most importantly, I had a lot of fun and it helped me get motivated to keep learning :)

If you want to get rid of nested loops take a look at itertools.product: import itertools for a, b in itertools.product(aa, bb): # (a0, b0) (a0, b1), (a0, b2), (a1, b0) ...

Merry Cake-Day. I totally agree on the password issue but I am also really wondering if the intent of the tool is for things where the password protection is more a pro-forma type thing. The "redis-cli" example from the git readme doesn't seem to have any secure way to run that command whether using rqs or not. Typing the command itself in place of rqs would just leave the password in your history file.

Pandas is a nice and great library. I may complain a lot about it, but not because it does it works badly. I complain because the notion behind pandas are complex, and because this lead to mandatory complex library. I love pandas, and it existence opened a lot of possibility in my daily work. Your employer may not be aware of that, but being a pandas core developer may be a way better line in your resume than your actual job. Thank you sir for the hard work and dedication.

When you need to process consecutive items of a list together. For example, you have a `lst = [1,4,8,10,3]` and you want to create a list of differences between consecutive values `[3, 4, 2, -7]` The regular way you would do it in other languages, looping by index: diff = [] for i in range(len(lst) - 1): diff.append(lst[i+1] - lst[i]) The pythonic way: diff = [next - item for item, next in zip(lst, lst[1:])] `zip(lst, lst[1:])` is the key here. It generates a list of pairwise items, eg: `[(1, 4), (4, 8), (8, 10), (10, 3)]`

&gt; I can't imagine asking others to write python code to customize their own reports ... If you are looking for a decent GUI Report builder written in python, I seriously doubt you can find one. Crystal reports can probably still be accessed via COM interface. (See [this tutorial](http://elviajedelnavegante.blogspot.com/2010/09/lanzar-informes-crystal-reports-desde.html) (in Spanish). Some modern report servers have GUI Report builders. For example, Jasper Reports has [iReport Designer](https://community.jaspersoft.com/wiki/ireport-designer-getting-started). But keep in mind that this is a Java server. You can access it from Python via SOAP, for example.
Ya know, I keep trying PyCharm. Wow that's a resource hog. There's things I really like about it, but I have an i7 laptop with 32 GB of RAM and an SSD and it struggles. My relatively infrequent commits are not my biggest worry, but it's still faster than TortoiseSVN. Regarding speed, speed of merges matters more to me. Git's merge just works. Ultimately, it's use a different client if you don't like that one. You can use the command line if you want. It legitimately is faster. If the goal is easy though, there are compromises.
When writing a class constructor with a lot of arguments as input, you can simply update the object's '__dict__' attribute in one line: def __init__(self, a, b, c, d, e): self.a = a self.b = b self.c = c self.d = d self.e = e vs. def __init__(self, a, b, c, d, e): self.__dict__.update(locals()) In my opinion, it looks much cleaner. Just make sure you know what you're doing with it so you aren't saving the wrong things as class attributes.

The thing about Python is that it relies on built in functions and not on object methods. It tries to fix this with these magic methods. In D and even Postgresql, a.foo() is equivalent to a.foo and foo(a) for example. In C# everything is an object so you just use methods. Operators can be overridden, all is fine. Coming to Python it feels like these magic functions are a way to circumvent an inherent problem.
Python has a walkthrough in it's documentation that was easy enough for me (freshman undergrad at the time) to at least get running and make some simple functions
I recently learned that Python caches regex patterns: &gt; Note The compiled versions of the most recent patterns passed to re.compile() and the module-level matching functions are cached, so programs that use only a few regular expressions at a time needn’t worry about compiling regular expressions. https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.compile It’s not clear from the note, but `re.compile` is also cached.

Wing lacks some features that PyCharm has (good automated checking, automatic mypy, coverage/profiling test integration) and a lot of bloat (that I haven't figured out how to turn off). It seems to lack Wing's far superior search, which doesn't seem all that complicated (it's just grep). Just trying PyCharm for a while to see if there's something better, but Wing is still my favorite. I'll probably try Wing 7 next.

Idk doesn't feel like circumvention to me, I find it a brilliant way for suggestive conventions --- you don't at all have to use them, but if you do, your objects get superpowers. It's one of my favorite aspects of Python.
Which part of it are you confused about or is it the entire thing?
I do “homework help” for a small fee

Thanks man! The class attributes approach is a smart solution for removing dependency on `isinstance`. I will keep that in mind. I have used `try..except` myself in similar use cases. But I'm never entirely sure if it's a good idea. Anyway, you mention your time series library. That sounds interesting! What does it do?
There is a lot of API frameworks. My favorite is probably [Falcon](https://falconframework.org). It's lightweight and gets the job done and it's really simple.
I often teach new coders "Strategy in comments, Tactics in code."
Also works for decimal places &amp;#x200B; \`18.219\_501\_656\_442\_024\_9\`
If you’re commenting in here and not helping you’re a douche ^^^ Do you have to use that starter code your prof has given you? It sucks imo... I could totally quickly code this up for you by just following the prompt / directions
What does numpy do that defining `__add__()`, `__sub__()`, etc. wouldn't be able to handle?
i just had a look on wololo and saw there's a PSP emulator for Switch now.. that's pretty cool
sounds well. I'll try it
Color science and vision, but it is for lights, specifically leds. Lights are specified by their spectra, which is a graph of "watt/nm" vs nm.
oh yeah i've been looking forward to trying 7 looks like it came out today! awesome
f strings: a = 'world' print(f'hello {a}!'}
I still do that sometimes, when it's really short stuff like that and it all fits on the screen nicely.
The thing is whenever you call str() you have no idea what's going to happen. It doesn't explicitly bind to any code piece. You don't define a str() function, it's not an override, is a different name and meaning. As about superpowers - in other platforms you can just implement interfaces. I have a rule of thumb that so far has stuck every time: If something is referred to as "magic" then it's a design flaw. It implies exceptions from rules, difficulty in understanding, and an excuse to write unmaintainable code. Take the operator overloading. For any operator you have to look up the magic method name, and everyone reading the code has to Google what that magic method does. Bad design. C++ and C# for instance refer to the operator specifically and not some name, and the overloading is obvious. For sure they're useful, but many other languages do this much better. This feels PHP-esque.
I have been working on a computer algebra system on the lines of SymPy from scratch so that I get more familiar with math and algorithms. Till now I have implemented a decent addition system with autosimplification for variables where the following additions can be simplified: x + y gives x + y as output x + y + y gives x + 2\*y 2\*x + 3\*x gives 5\*x x + y + z + x + 2 + y + 1 + z + x gives 3\*x + 2\*y + 2\*z + 3, etc. &amp;#x200B; Looking forward to implement more math operations on variables and implementing more advanced math in code.
Java, JS , golang and many other I think don't have proper operator overloading.
Python3 NamedTuple classes. This is weirdly undocumented: ``` class MyObj(NamedTuple): a: int b: int c: str ="asdf" ```
Very interesting work. Thank you so much for sharing! After a quick glance, `b.content(raw=True)`, should be same as `requests`. I think it's `b.data` for encoded data and `b.text` for decoded data. Also it seems strange to me that you have functions/methods that take text input that needs to be parsed instead of actual args/kwargs. E.g `b.input(id:=password)` instead of b.input(id='password'). Could you please explain why you made this choice? Perhaps I'm not seeing the entire picture and making incorrect assumptions.
Is this monkey patching?
Looks great! Does it have XPath query support? With Selenium I always found that to be the most powerful way of locating elements
Hi, i don't understand how you expect to find who is the children of 10 in the list. However, i also implemented a leap on python ( a binomial leap) and i used node classes to store for each node: the value,data,father,brother,son. I then created a tree class with everything i needed to have: the root,order of the root,how to add trees with the same ordre...
&gt;Make a PR to fix the documentation you didn’t like. Is there any part of: &amp;#x200B; " I am drafting some changes to a piece of documentation and I hope I'll be able to submit it soon " &amp;#x200B; which was unclear ?
Interesting project but why do we have to choose you instead of Selenium?
Looks nice, looking forward to playing with this.
&gt; `b.input(id:=password)` I think you meant `b.input("id:=password")`
Maybe start a new project?
Maybe I was unclear, but - read again, carefully - I never said I was caught out by unannounced and unexpected changes in the APIs. I said these changes are a nuisance and a negative when comparing Python to other languages. Clearer now? &amp;#x200B; I have often heard that, at least when comparing their applications to data sciences, most Python developers working on the key packages tend to have more experience in computer science and software design than in maths and stats, whereas the exact opposite tends to be true for R. It was this kind of civilised and informative discussion I was hoping for. Shame you decided to go down another route. &amp;#x200B; I ask you again: what is wrong in simply pointing out that some of the more advanced statistical techniques are implemented poorly in the most common Python libraries for data science? Users can decide for themselves whether it's an issue for them or not (it's not for me at the moment), but, again, what is wrong in simply pointing out this fact? Why attack me for it? What is there to disagree on? How would this show that I refuse to learn to discuss etc etc? &amp;#x200B; How is the fact that millions of people are using Python relevant? Billions of flies can't be wrong? By the same logic, should Excel be a better tool because more people use it than Python? Millions of people use Python probably because the pros outweigh the cons, which is what I said - NOT because it's perfect. Again, what is wrong in pointing out that reading and writing certain formats is much faster in R? I hadn't found this specific piece of information anywhere, but posted about it here and on stackoverflow in the hope it can be useful o other people. Not everyone has to read large Excel files, but, for those who do, knowing this can be very useful , and it is very easy to set up an ELT workflow with R -&gt; SQL -&gt; Python, or R -? Parquet -&gt; Python. Again, what is wrong in pointing this out? Why attack me for it? What is there to disagree on? &amp;#x200B; Your attitude reminds me of the fanatical fanboy evangelists who think that even a grandma who wants to skype with her grandchildren should learn to use Linux, or that everyone should use LaTeX even to write just a grocery shopping list.
That's the same concept I'm not able to implement, maybe we can use while loop to check if the number of that node is same as expected or we can mpve to the other node.
Have you consider storing your coordinates as a keys and messages/places as values in a dictionary? You may have problem using list as keys (coz they are not hashable), so i advise using tuples insted. Example: cords = {(1,2): 'place1', (2,2): 'place2'}
I'm not sure to understand what you mean but the idea is that tje brother,father,son links do not point to a number but another node that has this number as his value
Is this only for Windows? I'm trying to install it to Ubuntu but pip tells me he wants the module winreg that I've read is available only on Windows.
Well, a Macbook Pro 2016 (no mini-laptop!) at standard font size (16, same as browser, no serious eye problems) gives me 2 buffers side by side of width 86 characters each.
Python2 is EOL in 2020. For practical purposes it's been deprecated for many years.
Further to your set example, I found out how useful sets actually are for replacing for-loop-based many-to-many comparisons
What do you mean it doesn't bind to any piece of code? When you call str(a) it calls the __str__ method on a? Am I misunderstanding something?
I use 100 char as the limit for when I want to break the line. It's a cuter number.
Lots of libraries have failures in 3.7 due to changes in the way StopIteration is handled in generators. If your dependencies don't support it, you can't uograde. But probably 3.6 should work for most people on 3.
Sounds like a good next step could be handling small, random tasks. I'd recommend creating an account on [codewars.com](https://codewars.com) or something similar and start working through the challenges. That will get you writing small scripts to perform a specific task. Once you're comfortable with that, the next step would be taking a bigger project and working out how to break it down into smaller projects. Virtually every program you'll ever write can be broken down into smaller chunks.
You might want to take a look at [https://www.reportlab.com/](https://www.reportlab.com/). There's an open source version if you scroll down a bit.
Absolutely start a project. It will help you tie your knowledge together, practice it regularly and expand your skills - if only through all the googling, Stack Overflow-ing and GitHub-ing you're bound to end up with. I wouldn't overthink finding a project that will sharpen your skills in a specific direction. Rather, what are your hobbies and interests? See if you can make a tool that will simplify those, or allow you to utilize skills you've learned from them. It's a lot easier to stay motivated while working on something that actually interests you, whether that's a skill calculator for an MMO, a Flask website with your Spotify stats or a fly fishing analysis in Pandas. This is a question better asked in /r/learnpython, by the way.
The relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit is a good example of an *invariant*: a truth surrounding code that makes reasoning easier. Another popular invariant is that 'len()' returns the number of elements in a sequence. A good use of classes and objects is to enforce these invariants. While OOP can be a sledge hammer, your code exploits one of it's greatest strengths.
For CSV reorganizing I would search for some tutorials with the pandas module, there are tons of them. Regarding the UI, you have quite a few options (e.g. I used for my application tkinter) listed all here [https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming) . &amp;#x200B; In the end, if you are satisfied with your application you can even freeze the script into an executable with cx\_freeze. Easy to use, it does its job. Good luck!

\&gt; This is also my first API. So welcome any feedback :) Looks similar to the APIs of puppeteer / pyppeteer except for the lack of async/await. If you don't mind me asking, since you seem to also use puppeteer in the background somewhere, why did you go for Selenium for the base? I honestly don't think I currently know anybody still stuck to that for anything other than legacy reasons.
Recently-discovered pattern. 1. Make a function 'print_' that behaves like the print function, but does any other dev-type logging you want, too. 2. Generate a temporary text file that's essentially 1000 lines of "print_('TODO &lt;uuid&gt;')", where UUID is different on each line of the temporary file. 3. During coding, do liberal cutting and pasting from that text file over into your source. 4. When running your code during dev, check where "TODO: &lt;uuid&gt;" lines show up. Then search for those in your source code (eg, recursive grep for the UUID), and do more inspection and work on the logic there (eg: it's a function that you still need to fully implement). 5. Delete those print_('TODO: &lt;uuid&gt;') lines, as you finish debugging and testing and general dev on sections of your new code. 6. When you're almost done with dev, check if there's any remaining "print_('TODO: &lt;uuid&gt;')" lines in your code. ie, code you've added that still needs to be tested or implemented further. Basically, this is something like print-based/trace/etc-debugging, that helps you to be sure you've at least manually run and worked through all the code. It's something like a cheap and lazy manual version of integration/unit testing, combined with code coverage.
you could make a system wich asks for input, and gives answers related to that
Just got my nodejs based webdriverIO (selenium) to work with chromium/chrome/firefox and saw your post, lol https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/bavmua/microsoft_releases_new_microsoft_edge_based_on/ekggpa3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x
The install worked fine for me on MacOS.
Yes. The `re` module caches the first 100 compiled regexes. I have still never came across a program that uses more than 100 regexes. I feel this one looses readability for a tiny optimization of cache look-up.
Hey there, from your comment I think you are good with puppeteer, I apologize to interrupt over here. Can you modify my script below to **click** the first product in https://my.royalselangor.com/catalogsearch/result/?cat=&amp;q=bag+tag I tried several syntaxes like `page.$$` and `page.evaluate()` with Javascript and DOM api, but it just won't work my script that won't work: ``` const puppeteer = require('puppeteer') try { (async () =&gt; { let options = { executablePath: '/usr/bin/chromium', headless: false, //slowMo: 1, } const browser = await puppeteer.launch(options) let pages = await browser.pages(); const page = pages[0]; //await page.goto('https://my.royalselangor.com', {waitUntil: 'load'}); await page.goto('https://my.royalselangor.com/catalogsearch/result/?cat=&amp;q=bag+tag', {waitUntil: 'load'}); //await page.type('input#mb_search', 'bag tag'); //await page.click('button.search-button'); //const firstProduct = await ; //console.log(firstProduct[0]); await page.click((page.$$('a.product-image'))[0]); //const [response] = await Promise.all([ //page.waitForNavigation(), //console.log(page); //await page.evaluate(() =&gt; { // window.scrollBy(0, window.innerHeight); //let product = ; //await page.click(document.getElementsByClassName('first')); //}); //]); //await browser.close() })() } catch (err) { console.error(err) } ```
The templating libraries used in Django and Flask are perfectly useable outside of a web server context — I’ve used Jinja for all sorts of things in the past. You could pretty easily use a templating engine to render something like Markdown that’s then trivial to turn into a PDF. Take a look at [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) for the markup to PDF conversion. There are any number of combinations you could use.
So it's available only for Windows... What a pity
So it's available only for Windows... What a pity
"Fewer lines = better" is definitely a silly metric to apply universally, but so often for-loop implementations are pretty simple affairs, and once you've seen/used them a few times there really isn't any problem in such cases. I *love* list comprehensions, but as with anything else if one is too opaque, it should be broken down. Tldr: everything in moderation.
According to the Documentation, it does! &gt; **with** Browser**(**browser\_name=Browser.CHROME**)** **as** b**:** b.goto**(**"https://the-internet.herokuapp.com"**)** u = b.link**(**"xpath:=//\*\[@id='content'\]/ul/li\[14\]/a"**)**.url
Awesome :)
Yes, you are right. But I wouldn't be surprised if imports were actually implemented as exec's - and from what I know, the importing system is very flexible, and if writing a custom importer, using exec at some point is probably an easy way to solve it (I'm thinking like, imported from a database, different type of filesystem, dynamically downloaded code over the network, etc).
Just use diff tool on those files (first few lines since they are too big). It will show you where the difference is. Maybe it's quotes, different charsets, some unprintable symbols.
You might use a platform like hackerrank.com to improve your coding skills. Challenging yourself everyday with problems will help you being a better coder.
"Are you sure that shouldn't be a function on its own?"
Possibly an artifact of the library used for dom parsing
Awesome. Only started using all and any in my last python project, but I'd never seen that tricky use of next before! Gotta say though, those conventional for loops would all be "better" as while loops (but the any/all/next versions are best!).

&gt;You can make Python more like javascript! OMG WHY WOULD YOU... hang on... That's pretty cool! Still though, JavaScript can suck it ;P
Generators in general are something every budding python programmer should get into once they have the basics down.
"str" != "__str__"
Anything but shitty electron
I think you meant partition where you put split on that last line. But that's neat, never heard of partition in python before :)
Why do you hate it so much?
I can’t link directly to the video, it’s embedded in the AICPA webpage. The best I can do is link directly to AICPA’s page https://www.aicpa.org/interestareas/frc/assuranceadvisoryservices/auditdatastandards.html
And? How is reading the manual to understand that `str` calls `__str__` a "design flaw"?
Resource usage... Besides being materialisation of a frustrated web developer not being able to write a desktop app, so the solution is... Lets embed a browser so my app can work... It is just not the right technology, being able to do it does not mean you should... And i mean if you have a hard deadline or this is just a school project or prototipe, whatever... But i stoped using VS Code (an amazing app) just for being written with that shit, its like having anothe chrome open, but chrome at least makes me feel the ram it uses is justified
Well said.
So what do you advocate for? Which editor do you use instead of vscode?
yes, thank you - fixed
Qt5. It's modern, supported and unlike electron, does not require Javascript.
Contact the administrator.
Interesting, but is not the same thing done by PhantomJS?
You have things like `refresh`, `forward`, and `back` set as properties on your browser that return `self`. Why are they properties instead of methods? `browser.back()` makes more sense to me than `browser.back` to go back to the previous page.
Python and Blender are a match made in open source heaven.
I don't think we have problem today with desktop PC prices to justify not using a tool you like just because it uses a bit more RAM than some other tool. I use both PyCharm and VS Code and Pycharm uses a lot more RAM than Code.

Impossible to say without knowing what you did before. Is this a brand new project or an existing one, what have you changed and what did you check?
If a code runs and nobody is there to monitor its progress, does it return an output? But seriously, I think the short answer is yes, because you’re asking about running a piece of code on a remote server.
I have two modules, One is working properly, But the other one is not working It shows error!
Dude, no. Take it to a JS troubleshooting sub.
Again: &gt; Is this a brand new project or an existing one, if it was existing, did it work before or has it never worked?
I bit more ram... Gedit uses 6 megs, sublimetext under 200Mg... VS code 800Megs ~ 1Gb This is not a bit of ram, do not get confused, besides having cheaper ram is so that you can run more stuff not do the same with different graphics... This is the reason why no matter how much ram you have, you will never have enough as long as developers keep thinking that way... Sure we have pretty decent computers but your users most certainly not
Whew, you got quite the road ahead of you. This is the only hint you get from me. const products = await page.$$('a.product-image'); await products[0].click();
When I use VS Code it takes less than 800 MB and other Electron apps I use do not take more than 100 MB RAM.
Great work. What value does this provide that splinter doesn’t?
Still, it would be more user friendly if the function reconstructed those strings itself automatically from the keyword arguments.
It would be more pythonic yes, but there may be more nuanced use cases here. Like (disclaimer, making shit up. There may be no real reason) if there's a way to specify precedents on the selector. Possibly a way to say it has to match both of these selectors. Etc. Stuff you can capture in some syntax in a string that doesn't map well to kwargs. A kwargs mapping still works, but it would potentially have to be built from more complicated objects. Lastly, it requires you to know the ins and outs of that library's syntax, at the level of the developers, to be sure you're building the strong correctly from kwargs.
That being said (see my other response) At the very least it could accept kwargs for the common use cases, and then allow a "raw" kwarg or something if you're doing something powerful that the wrapping doesn't provide you. That may be the "best of both worlds" approach

In raw benchmark speed for UI rendering, Qt wins over Electron slightly. In terms of flexibilty to the GUI you can build and how easy it is to make nice graphics, Electron beats Qt by a large margin. We use html/JS frontend for games and we wouldn't even think of trying that with Qt. In terms of program speed, Javascript under Electron is going to be faster than Python with Qt, unless you're using the C libraries of python, like numpy. Python has no JIT and it's often orders of magnitude slower than JS's V8 interpreter. In terms of memory use, Electron uses a lot an Qt doesn't. TkInter goes in the bin unless your program is really simple.

Do you by any chance have a file named requests.py in the same directory?
The fact that it's not obvious when it should be
What about the logs? :/
I see what you mean. Then receiving a list of tuples/namedtuples would be a more pythonic solution in your hypothetical case.
Yes, this is the answer. I opened both files and printed the 1st line from each. The csv written file does not contain “” around each item while the original does.
It would be very nice to implement a downloadable block list, and hav a toggle switch that can automatically disable it for a few minutes. You may want to look the pi-hole project for an example of feature sets.
Paste the original code and press Ctrl + Shift + I keys combination - now you have it even without saving the file. :) You have installed some extension that does that on save, or you add that switch to your VS Code configuration, etc.
Not Electron. While Electron lets you write your app as a web app that runs anywhere, it does so by wrapping it in what is essentially a customised Chromium browser. The problem is that this is very resource-intensive (memory footprints in the gigabytes are not uncommon) and sluggish. So you get a quicker development path, but your users get a bloated, unresponsive application that takes seconds to respond to menu clicks and ends up slowing their machine down. Electron is the software-engineering equivalent of a leveraged buyout; if you use it to develop an application, you’re taking out technical debt and pushing it onto your users. Perhaps they’ll grumble and put up with it, or (if they are in a position to do so), order a new machine with more RAM and CPU cores, or perhaps they’ll go with a competing app that’s written in native code using native UI elements and is vastly more efficient and responsive.
For people that want to know more about blender i suggest Blender Guru on youtube or CGgeek or if you want a course cg cookie is great
A lot of the time I work in a notebook so I don't have to store api results in a file locally or keep hitting the database while iterating through everything. Depends what you're working on though.
Thank you for sharing this. I'll definitely take a look!
1. Where's the code? Do you have a github, gitlab, etc. repo for this? 2. PyBrowser has a lot of name collision. I see at least 4 projects that are different, one of which has this name on PyPI. You probably want to change the name. `pysurf`, `surfboard`, and `pybrows` are all available on PyPI.
If you go with Qt5 and you've developed a commercial app, then keep in mind that you should either purchase the PyQt license or stick with the PySide2.
[PySimpleGUI](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/cookbook/) for simplicity [Kivy](https://kivy.org/#home) for the rest?
This! Plus you're posting on a Python forum, so assuming you prefer to write Python, you will want Qt5 since Electron means writing Javascript. Electron is also insidious because its quick to make something sort-of-work so you think 'great I'm nearly there' but then to make this really work, all the time without glitches and performance problems is a nightmare. This is probably 90% of the reason there are so many shitty Electron-based apps, people release the first build that runs without crashing and then spend the rest of their life hunting bugs in the trashpile they made. Then Electron releases a new version that breaks everything. Meanwhile I have 10 year old Qt-based scripts that still work. &amp;#x200B; That said, if you are really just sticking a simple GUI on a CLI tool maybe PySimpleGUI is better for you, you can easily switch the GUI backend to see what works best for you (and you can tweak the colors etc to make it nice).
Thanks for your opinion. For a downloadable block list, I just left this for the user cuz there are many repos that have been blocked by corporations requests. You can easily reach hosts lists online and then add them manually to the test script. &amp;#x200B; For in-browser blocker, I prefer not working on browser side :) Thx &lt;3
Check out the Enaml package for python. It's a framework on top of PyQt5 that makes creating GUIs so much nicer and more pythonic.
I'll be interested in trying this later today. What advantages does it provide over just using Selenium? Just an easier-to-use API?
That's a good point. Not always a solution, but certainly a good one in many cases.
Drop tk and switch to Qt. PyQt/PySide is also has a more flexible system for defining behavior when you press a button or whatever.

Are you creating a Python CAD application for the fun of a Python project, or do you simply need a Python-scriptable CAD package? &amp;#x200B; If you need a Python-scriptable CAD package, FreeCAD has become pretty awesome, and you can import it into Blender's Python interpreter and script 3D geometry. It even has its own Python interpreter, so you can build Python scripts to build geometry. It's pretty amazing for all kinds of CAD tasks and continues to receive developer love. &amp;#x200B; Just about any GUI is going to have a [canvas widget](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/api-kivy.graphics.instructions.html) on which you can [draw lines](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/api-kivy.graphics.html#kivy.graphics.Line) and [rectangles](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/api-kivy.graphics.html#kivy.graphics.Rectangle). &amp;#x200B; [This StackOverflow conversation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36343216/resizing-rectangle-when-resizing-main-window-while-rectangles-size-is-changed-i) discusses resizing Kivy rectangles.
Your question shouldn't be "how to go from bytes to JSON", but "how to go from bytes to strings". The answer is: use `bytes.decode`, with the correct encoding (which is probably UTF-8, which is also the default, but it doesn't _have_ to be, so watch out). Also, /r/learnpython.
Of course it's Qt5.
Not a fan of Electron either, but I'm completly fine with apps that start a local webserver and let you render the app on any browser, like Jupyter Notebook. Actually I much rather have a browser interface, paired with a CLI interface, than what almost all other GUI apps do out there.

&gt; Typing the command itself in place of rqs would just leave the password in your history file. I assume the 'correct' way to do things like this is to store credentials in a `.env` style file with the correct permissions. Something like: $ touch creds.env $ chmod 600 creds.env $ vim creds.env $ ... $ cat c reds.env REDIS_AUTH=abcdefg $ env $(cat creds.env | xargs) redis-cli -p 6379 -h localhost -a $REDIS_AUTH Either that or run `redis-cli` in interactive mode. --- BUT that also ignores the fact that this utility relies on the users umask being set correctly to prevent others from reading the pickled file.

My mate mentioned on Staurday that his gf asks him "is it cold outside?" everyday and he thinks it's stupid so I'm working on daily automated text message with random variation of said question. Anyone knows free web texting site that would work in UK? I got the random messages sorted, just need to build the actual send part of the code.
Puppeteer is Chrome/only, right? For anything other than internal tools, restricting automated testing to only chrome is doing a huge disservice to the broader browser ecosystem by making it harder for browsers like Firefox and opera to exist, and allowing google to dictate the defacto web standards, much like Microsoft used to. On the other side, for web automation, restricting to chrome only limits what you can actually do when you run into chrome compatibility issues, although those are rarer.
Working on my first project ever! It’s a text based adventure (loosely... mostly just practicing different stuff and making a story with it) and I’m currently working on getting an inventory going. It’s been more fun than I thought it would be. Even with the frustration. Decided I need a career change at thirty so practicing my skills as I plan on going to uni for computer sciences. It’s never too late! (Unless I die.)
Yeah, it depends on winreg so is windows only ... too bad, I wanted to give it a try
Damn, I wanted to try this when I was gonna get home. :(
No. PhantomJS is a headless browser which can be driven by something like selenium, which this library uses under the hood. So rather than replicating the script, it would just replace Browser.CHROME with Browser.PHANTOMJS. However, Chrome and Firefox came out with headless versions so the primary maintainer of PhantomJS decided to kill it off. Shame because it's much easier to use IMO.
I think Twilio has a free trial, I don't know if there's other options.
I've resurrected a project that went into hibernation for a while: Aki, a simple programming language that uses Python and the `llvmlite` library.

&gt; TkInter goes in the bin unless your program is really simple. I'd counter that by saying anything you can do with Qt, you can do with Tk as well. The main difference is that Tk isn't loaded to the teeth with pre-built widgets, but that doesn't mean you can't make what you need; and you'll find if done correctly, Tkinter is capable of being even more memory/performance efficient than Qt.

Oh, my bad, it just takes 259 Mb and 10% of an I5 while idle with a 6 lines file open...(literally just checked it); and of course pycharm uses more ram, it is a fully featured IDE, i don't mind about it, but for above basic text editing... not ever!
IIRC puppeteer-firefox is a thing, at least experimental. And sure, all valid points. I just found the API and ecosystem much more convenient nowadays and honestly, time is a much more valuable resource. Microsoft this week switched edge to chromium, I have no idea which market has a significant share of opera users and for many practical purposes (like purely functional tests) Firefox and Chrome are pretty well aligned these days. I mean, is it a trade off? Absolutely. But I'm not in the consumer segment at the moment, for my purposes puppeteer fits the bill pretty well. As for automation, puppeteer really made a difference imho. Back when it came out automating a full Firefox instance was such an unstable pain with horrible API that even IE was more usable.
Howcome the 'hi' appears at the top? Did you modify manage.py?
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6ljHxJQ47Uk Finding volume is an entirely different challenge though.
Nope, It was in views.py, I was testing that how far my code was working
Do your own homework.
can you show the output of python manage.py makemigrations python manage.py migrate python manage.py runserver
That is not the same of an app that has an embedded browser on it
I would first return to the original state, then modify the code one step at a time, each time checking if the server still starts. Then you can find the step that breaks the server.
I was checking your code to see if we can make it compatible with Mac OS or Linux, since you are using winreg for Internet Explorer setup. &amp;#x200B; I added a pull request with a suggestion to fix this.. feedback is welcome btw &amp;#x200B; [https://github.com/abranjith/pybrowser/pull/2](https://github.com/abranjith/pybrowser/pull/2)
Between Qt5 and electron, I'd pick Qt5. Another option to consider is wxPython, which is good for light, simple, clean, native looking interfaces, and if it's a cli&gt;gui app, that may be all you need.
Migrations are working properly. It is the only runserver which is causing error! https://pastebin.com/vpavjDfY Log file of that!

I found the MLBGame API that allows you to access real-time baseball information. I created a program where I just input the team I want and I can get the box score of their game today, or change the date and get the box score of any game they've played in the past. My next step is to run this script on a Rasp. Pi and display the box score output on an LED screen. If I am successful, my next step would be to customize the script for individual teams and maybe give these as gifts to some of my relatives who love baseball.
Have you read [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04481)?
Sorry yo, my name is also Alex and I love coffee, and I'd get coffee with you, but I completely disagree on every point you made, entirely.
Can you show the content of the views.py that handles the POST to `/output_collection`?
https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/parametrize.html
Yes, but interestingly the specific example of `10000000 is 10000000` *does* return True in CPython 3.7, even though ``` a = 10000000 b = 10000000 a is b ``` returns False. Presumably there's some optimization in the expression parser.
They dislike the fact that built in functions call methods. They would prefer that to get a str you call `obj.str()` and you override a `str()` method so that it uses the same interface both in writing and calling.

Writing a library for interacting with the API for Check Point firewalls. I don't like the library that Check Point has created so I'm writing my own for (at least for now) personal use. The end goal is to create a dashboard for application owners to query the firewall for firewall rules that apply to their application servers, without actually giving them direct access to the firewall itself. I'm doing it so they can stop asking me for the information since I have to get it for them manually as it is right now.

I know I won't convince people. Python is one of me favorite languages but there are things I hate in it, and some things I feel that are made better in other languages/platforms. The same is true about most, if not all other languages. Try them out next to python. It's a great insight.
&gt;TkInter goes in the bin unless your program is really simple. My program is indeed very simple. It is basically a service that runs in the background and monitors the system clock and occasionally interacts with an API. I don't want to use TK coz it just looks ugly when the app is made and takes more effort to make it work. The reason why I want to get a gui, is to allow the user to make changes to a config file and trigger an action if needed. &gt;In terms of deployment to end users, Python is problematic. PyInstaller works sometimes. Electron will just work I want the app to be installable on all Linux, Windows and MacOS. Is this a compelling reason to use Election?
Thanks for the suggestion - I haven't used Hypothesis, but will be checking it out!
How does PySide2 compare with Qt5?
I used to have that same mentality "it's just me, so...", but now knowing a bit more about testing? I want to *punch my former self in the face!* It's that big of a difference, IMO. Not sure why someone downvoted you for being honest, but testing and logging will literally make you seem like a mind reader - your bosses would be amazed and your job/scripts/homework/whatever will seem infinitely easier. You can even write scripts to troll through your logs, look for particular issues that are a big problem and alert you the moment they occur! You can then relax a bit at that point - because you'll have a nice system in place to make sure nothing bad goes down with your app - but if it does, you'll know right away! Check into testing like yesterday - you'll be super, super glad you did. No more wondering "oh yeah, I wrote this 10 months ago and it was spaghetti I never cleaned up... what does this do again?" You can just change whatever, run your tests. All pass? All *good!*
Do a little reading on Graphic Design. Google a couple of tutorials on how to make a nice looking window. For tkinter, creating custom buttons is one way to make it look better. It's more of a "custom graphic's creation" problem than a technical programming one.
[PySimpleGUI](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org) will enable you to try running your code on tkinter, Qt, WxPython and a web page, without changing your code. It takes an afternoon to learn and code up a simple application that's useful.
Ok I'll give it a try. Thanks
It's the official Qt (company) Python wrapper for Qt5, created as alternative to Riverbank Computing's PyQt that doesn't ship with LGPL or similar licesne, only GPL and commercial. PySide2 has got all three options available.
Thanks.
I appreciate you pointing out exactly why it's so bad. It's basically just a joke in a tiny personal script, so it won't ever hurt anyone haha
What do [these](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python_Missing_Bindings) missing bindings mean? Are they libraries from Qt5 that are not available in PySide2?
Whatever gets you there
There are better ways to write the script for sure, but adding the counters makes it easier to understand for beginners I think.
Good bot
Yep, but that shouldn't be a factor for your initial decision. Qt is a complete framework, not just GUI and you won't notice anything's missing for this op project. Maybe just QVariant, and that's only if you read some PyQt tutorials.
I built this at my work with a YuMi from ABB. But when it won't it would taunt you and when it lost it would pick the board up and fling it.
There are basically 2 strategies: 1. If shopify can hit a webhook for you, set up a little webserver that will run your script. If you're on AWS maybe look at lambda and gateway. 2. Update your script to store the most recently seen timestamp in a database, then make your script only deal with orders newer than that timestamp. Once this is done you can set it up as a cron job and you're good to go. Hope this helps!

&gt; Python is one of me favorite languages but there are things I hate in it, and some things I feel that are made better in other languages/platforms. For sure, I don't disagree with that at all. I just disagree on *this* being one of those points :). For an example of an annoyance I have with Python: even though I don't actually *do* much functional programming, I wish functional programming in Python wasn't "non-Pythonic." I find the separation of "functions" vs "procedures" as you would have in Pascal for e.g. to be a pretty useful idea, and I think proper functional support *could* (even *does*) harmonize very well with Python's excellent iteration protocols. But because it is "bad" in Python, it doesn't have the right amount of support to make it faster, more widely supported, etc. &gt; The same is true about most, if not all other languages. Try them out next to python. It's a great insight. That is certainly good advice for any serious programmer.

On the left is the solution to a partial differential equation that is an ideal representation of neural activity in the neocortex. Each pixel represents a neuron. High neural activity is denoted in yellow, low or inhibitory activity is in blue. This type of solution is called a bump solution. With spike-frequency adaptation and no input to the cortical surface, the bump moves with constant velocity, which has been observed observed in cortical slices (Pinto and Ermentrout 2001). (Spike-frequency adaptation means that with high neural activity, neurons get tired and eventually become less active). The bump moves because as one region becomes less active, an adjacent region is excited. Eventually adaptation catches up and reduces neural activity, but not before another adjacent region is excited and so on. By introducing an input current, which can represent, for example, an object in space, or your position in space, the bump solution can do strange things. Typically, the bump will get stuck to the input current, as has been recently observed in the fruit fly brain (Kim et al 2017). To the best of my knowledge, the other weird solutions in this video, i.e., the oscillations and chaotic movements, have not been observed, however these other solutions could represent brain states where the observed object is stationary, but the perception changes over time (like in hallucinations). &amp;#x200B; As for the mathematical ELI5, the left panel shows the full solution to a partial differential equation (PDE). We noticed that the bump solution to the PDE always has a well-defined centroid, and in fact the centroid (right panel) does a good job of quantifying the movement of the bump. Therefore, it made sense to reduce the dimensionality to just the centroid coordinates. This dimension reduction resulted in a system of differential equations, which turned out to be much easier to analyze using classic dynamical systems theory while allowing for more general assumptions (Park and Ermentrout 2018). If any of you are thinking of majoring in math or becoming mathematicians feel free to comment or message with questions! &amp;#x200B; Code: [https://github.com/youngmp/park\_and\_ermentrout\_2017/blob/master/full\_adaptation\_demo\_2d.py](https://github.com/youngmp/park_and_ermentrout_2017/blob/master/full_adaptation_demo_2d.py) Paper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.06168.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.06168.pdf)

&gt; Any good reason you would suggest completely dropping Tkinter (standard library) Yes. &gt; for Qt (documentation historically catered to those using C++) Yes. You do realize that Tkinter came from the language TCL/Tk right? You have the same issue. &gt; Tkinter calls are translated into Tcl commands which are fed to this embedded interpreter, thus making it possible to mix Python and Tcl in a single application. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tkinter &gt; and Python module famously un-Pythonic)? Tk is worse.
**Tkinter** Tkinter is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit. It is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit, and is Python's de facto standard GUI. Tkinter is included with standard Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X installs of Python. The name Tkinter comes from Tk interface. Tkinter was written by Fredrik Lundh.Tkinter is free software released under a Python license. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Qt is definitely more powerful, but it is not necessarily better looking than Tkinter. For example, Calibre e-book reader is an example of python-Qt program. Does [his look](https://calibre-ebook.com/demo) like a native interface to you? Regarding Tkinter, try to [change the overall theme](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24367710/how-do-i-change-the-overall-theme-of-a-tkinter-application) of your application and see whether it helps. Learn about styles and themed widgets that are part of ttk package.

Isn’t that basically tic tac toe in a nutshell anyways
It's interesting that these languages all evolved, at least partially, from Latin. Personally, after I learned Latin, I found that I was better with French. Even my native English vocabulary was enhanced. Several years later, I could make headway with the Italian comments in a Fortran program listing sent to me via snail mail. Would this AI be "smarter" if it learned Latin conjugations?
&gt; You do realize that Tkinter came from the language Tcl/Tk right? You have the same issue. I'm aware, but I'd argue that I, in fact, do not have the same issue. I have never once been inclined to leverage Tcl whilst using Tkinter, as Tkinter is a *Python* module and does *not* require usage of Tcl for any given task. Tcl is a scripting language, as is Python. All it does is allow calls to the C Tk library, which Python is also capable of. &gt; ~snip~ ~wiki link~ all of which are done for you, you never *have* to use Tcl in the case of Tkinter if you know what you're doing &gt; Tk is worse. Perhaps we have two very different ideas of what the term "Pythonic" means.

What resources did you find for working with the MLB API? I've done a bit of work with the NHL version which is loosely based on the MLB technology so I wonder if there is a bit of overlap in the documentation and understanding?
It Tea bag after a win ? Awesome !
My pi approximation piece is impossible to without UI, so I'm putting it on hold until I get that down. Any ideas for interesting terminal based projects? Preferably something with a bit of interesting math behind it. :)
YouTube. Or the obvious a google search
Yep, as it's a solved game. Player 2 (robot) *has* to stay on defense until a mistake is made. I do get what pancakeRat is going for with their comment though ;p
yes
They exist here.
Can you just detect a lack of motion to know the piece was moved instead of hitting the keyboard?

 work in progress on a python automation webservice with Rancher &amp; Kubernetes pods for some specific workload. Here, a Minecraft micro services with layer 4 loadbalancer (NSX Edge) and dynamic storageclass leveraging k8s vSphere Cloud provider for world saving pods. I plan to add a bot service to support Slack/Discord/ Alexa for provisioning on demand. vRA integration for Rancher orchestration and catalog mapping for selfservice k8s workloads is planned as well. It could be a good bootstrap who anyone want to get in k8s and rancher workload automation. This micro service on demand should be compatible on vanilla bedrock Minecraft version (all platform)
Could you imagine what Dwight Schrute would do if he seen this???
I used [this](http://panz.io/mlbgame/) API. It's pretty good and has some documentation. I really only use one of the modules right now. I want to be able to show current batter, count, and runners on base, but I'm still getting it off the ground. I'm thinking of submitting my code on /r/learnpython to see how I can optimize it, because my code feels very clunky and it's just kind of a linear step-by-step execution of all the lines of code. No functions or anything.

Working on a script to help make my ereader more useful to me by taking pdfs, searching for their source latex files, and reformatting them into mobi or epub formats. I'm also using this mini project as a chance to learn better documentation habits and automated testing habits.
tjan ks dude, I will check it out and correct the bug
Latin is my next language to add.
It's usually good to learn new things by trying them, but don't ever learn cryptography or security this way. By the time you've learned enough to be safe, all your data will be stolen and your users will have sued you.
I think the human's AI needs some tweaking. He totally missed that block that left the robot's win wide open.
Interestingly enough, most languages suffer from similar subtle difficulties when directly extending the built in collection types. Usually composition is recommended instead of inheritance. Luckily for python, duck-typing can make composition much nicer.
What happens if you let it start the game?
executing code downloaded over the internet sounds dangerous, well, rolling your own downloader and exec'er at least. &amp;#x200B; Though i have no idea what you're trying to do or why you'd need to ever do that either. Sounds pretty strange
It depends on what you mean by "only python". I would use boto3 (AWS python lib) and python lambdas to use API gateway and AWS S3 for a backend. And then you can use [Transcrypt](https://www.transcrypt.org/) to build your front end.
I am fiddling with Azure DevOps REST API and smtplib. I am automating boring day to day tasks like watching area paths for new Product Backlog Items and updates to existing ones. A summary is now sent to me by email every morning. Good stuff! My immediate next step is to format the email nicer. Right now it looks like something out of geocities.
Snapchat is excellent for bots! Whatsapp, not so much.
Half way through your explanation I had an epiphany. I don't give a shit.

I've used the package manager [CloudRepo.io](https://CloudRepo.io) for my private and public python repositories!
that's a good and balanced summary. Except that tkinter comes with python, so it's easier to get and to distribute
I finally released my [Bytecode parser](https://github.com/martmists/bytepatches) and I'm looking into adding more features. Additionally, I'm working on a high-level customizable protocol parser.

you're right, thanks
If someone will always buy everything, put everything in the most expensive bucket. Done.
I had to work with it. It was certainly unmaintained for us because of the integration we had, but the nightmare part is that its pointless complexity. Why would anyone reimplement their own extended version of python to describe a UI, and use it within a context manager so that the .enaml format is correctly tokenised and parsed, all to introduce a complex cassowary based layouting engine that nobody 99.9% of the time ever needs? It's pointless complexity for the sake of feeling smart.
In the Delphi world and its move to Unicode an "ANSI_string" type was introduced to help users ease into moving over the Unicode. What happened? All the old_timers simply changed all their old strings to ANSI_string and continued to write **new** code with the ANSI_string type for *years*. Eventually there was interest from the company that sells the compiler in replacing the ancient x86 Windows target compiler with a modern LLVM-based one as they'd used for the newer OS X/Linux/Android targets. They wanted to remove a lot of old cruft though, including ANSI_string. What happened? The users began whining "You can't! We haven't had any time to change our code!" This continued for every deprecated feature and the company eventually dropped the idea of a new compiler entirely. Worse, end users even compelled them to introduce the ANSI_string type into the brand-new Android and iOS targets, ensuring they'll never be able to get read of legacy strings. When I moved to Python in 2012 I saw the same problem going on with Python 2 and argued that Guido needed to embrace the "D" in BDFL. I said back then that porting new features to 2, adding legacy syntax to 3 or extending the deadline would just lead to users taking that extra time to do nothing but write more legacy code.
Exactly, and this greatly extended the time it would otherwise have taken to move everyone to 3.x.
I recomend you spending like half time reserved for programming on reading documentation (especially at the beginning). Knowledge of possibilities will make coding time more productive and with better quality code.
Was expecting a victory dance at the end. Was not disappointed.
It wasn't developed for more than two years. It started again recently. It certainly was unmaintained when I used it.
If you are really interested in problems like this, look into MiniZinc -- it has a python API as well. https://www.minizinc.org/
thanks :)
&gt; Oh I am sorry if I didn't bother to read the hundredth tab on my browser that may or may not be relevant in 3 months' time. I am also sorry that I picked wrong choice of the day in pipenv that because the author is a weirdo, then we are not going to use it. Stop passing the buck. I don't care if it was your thousandth. Even if you didn't read the primary source, you shouldn't have taken a shitty 2+ or 3+ levels down source as correct. &gt; I can introduce you to at least 20 in my company alone. And the reason why it's like that, it's because it's not clear in the documentation itself. People see the thing, wonder why it's duplicated, and they just slap the same stuff in both, even go as far as read one from the other. &gt; Let's accept it: everybody is over his fucking head with everything. RTFM is not a justification. If we have to RTFM we only do that, because the amount of documentation and stuff that changes all the time is simply TOO MUCH to leave any available time to get anything done. People code by copying and pasting what they find online. and that's not unprofessionalism. it's because there's no fucking time to do otherwise. Do not blame the system for your parties' horrendous practices. I get paid to do my job properly, even if deadlines are missed. Perhaps I've earned that right with experience and time. But regardless sitting down and accepting bad practices is a no-no. Show resistance and switch employers if necessary. As an aside, I'm not an acronym person so I'm only making a loose inference on "RTFM" &gt; SAT solver? Still not an acronym person. Yes, I'm also the kind of person that if he had a shortened common name I'd prefer the full name. &gt; The fact that a PEP exists does not mean it will be implemented. Yes, but the fact that the PEP exists and was accepted, and has major support from both PyPA, PSF, and external developers means it most likely will, and im fact currently is. The PEPs are still subject to change, but general development has explicitly been given the green light in the mailing lists back in Sep '17. &gt; Ok so you are telling me that PyPA and everything it produces is stuff python programmers shouldn't bother to read? Do you really hope to stop the tide with your hands? Everywhere I go people learn by first hit on google. If there's a PEP, they don't give a fuck. No, I'm saying people have to read critically and not give blind faith. &gt; I seriously doubt it. &gt; Personally, I don't give a damn. I just want one, so I can code, instead of wasting my time learning how to even get started. Are we arguing here or...?
I was slightly concerned that he wouldn't, but I'm the end he found the correct solution of inheriting from the collections.abc classes.

Geewhiz, thanks!
If you write down your desired as tests you kind of get TDD
I see. I only took the most cursory glance and noticed the latest commit
Nice! Now all you need is a robot that can press enter.
On, b.content method having a flag vs having 2 different methods, that was a conscious choice. I presumed raw=True is probably a rare use case. And I think you mean it is response.content vs response.text in requests. On the locator format being a positional argument in the form "locator\_type:=locator\_value" was again done to keep it simple. I figured instead of having multiple keyword arguments (you have id, xpath, name, tag\_name etc) this might be more intuitive from API standpoint. If you have multiple locator types as keyword arguments, then you run into questions like - what to do when both id and xpath are provided and so on ? Still, willing to re-look at my approach once again. Thanks for the feedback 😊
I have tried to keep methods with no arguments as properties wherever I could. Agree these are not true properties of the object and might be a bit confusing. But I also think from an end user standpoint these might be an ok choice :-) Thanks for the feedback though 😊
Sorry to hear that. I really wanted this thing to be cross-browser and cross-os. Unfortunately I use windows only and don't have access to Macs and the Linux systems. This particular issue is an easy fix, will be pushing it today. If you come across more such issues, please raise them as issues (defects) in github Thanks for taking time &amp; the feedback 😊
hopefully you can still try 😊
puppeteer is basically just Chromium and not really Chrome (or any mainstream browsers for that matter). I am using it just for some html rendering. We will see, sometime in future if there is a better alternative to Selenium (faster ;) ), will switch to that Selenium is still quite popular btw :D
Sorry to hear that. Can you send me or post the complete code ? And also steps followed to install pybrowser please
that was quick .. awesome thanks for doing that😊
To be honest, I just heard about splinter. So can't really comment. I am sure splinter is great and there are probably other libraries too. I have made an attempt to answer why pybrowser in the docs. Who knows, you might find something useful in pybrowser 😊
no and no, I will update in description. Should have done it in the first place
Why not build it in a loop? Define a bunch of arrays and build the dictionary programmatically one time. Then store it in something like memory or session or nosql.
Not sure how PhantomJS works internally. I always thought it was a browser based on chromium or something. pybrowser isn't really a browser. It is merely an interface to various browsers 😊
That code doesn't make sense as all the leafs have the same value.
😃
Let me know how it goes 😊
Pretty-much ! An easier interface and some interesting (hopefully useful) features too. Please check docs for info 😊
 Let me know how it goes 😊
Nice! Thanks for taking the time to put that together and share it,
I suggest using PySImpleGUI. You can then package it into an EXE for distribution with auto-py-to-exe That is a super simple and clear way of rapidly building GUIs. If you use the Tkinter version of PySImpleGUI then your final package doesn't need the full load of QT DLLs and packages.
I assume they are using the initial dictionary to set the values as defaults that are changed later?
Using Django, DRF, Postgres and Vue to create a web app to track my future internship applications. I plan on applying to a lot and struggled a bit in keeping everything organized with Excel/Evernote/Google Calendar so I was like f*** It I'll build a web app for it. I plan on finishing the main features by August (currently busy with exams).
You can fling a board whenever you want! Don't let your dreams be dreams!
I also see documentation for locator is missing, so is probably even more confusing. Thanks for highlighting that, will update the docs
I'm learning python right now so it's just gonna take a little time my brother.

Aww it's like parents letting their kids win.
The robot is probably playing an optimal tic tac toe strategy. That's not too hard to program. I think the meatbag just made an intentional error, so they could see their creation win. That's probably much more of a feeling of accomplishment than winning a game of tic tac toe.

i suggest getting an android phone.
FreeCAD looks awesome, thanks!
kivy is a nice gui for graphical apps. do you really want to recreate a 2D CAD from scratch or modify an existing open source CAD for your needs?
I ask because I was reading about "Minimax" algorithm, demonstrated here: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-make-your-tic-tac-toe-game-unbeatable-by-using-the-minimax-algorithm-9d690bad4b37 If you play this game and intentionally give the AI a chance to get three in a row, it will instead waste it's turn blocking you. Will still end in a tie every time, but the algorithm seems to be "make sure the other one doesn't win" instead of "make sure the other one doesn't win OR get three in a row"
another nice option is the hardkernel machines. https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-c0/
I would say that in my experience its trivial to connect an external board (ATMEL or ESP32) to an android handset with either BLE or USB OTG. I've done both many times and you keep all the normal phone functions.
put it in a loop with some sleep time in between small movements. play around with the movement and sleep time combo until you get a smooth slow rotation. you could even put it in a class and set it up to move the servo at different speeds in different parts of your program.
Dude I understand.... but am not gonna let something like that happen coz am not learning cryptography or security
&gt; I'm in 2.7(industry imposed) Do they at least have a plan to either move to Python 3 by [the end of this year](https://pythonclock.org/), or get commercial support for 2.7?
Hey, [`types.SimpleNamespace` is in the standard library!](https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.SimpleNamespace) (and it's basically a fast version of the above, with a better `repr`)
Now play global thermo nuclear war
Consider using [`dataclasses`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) (3.7+ stdlib), or [`attrs`](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/) (any version, PyPI) - you get the same concise definition, but also a nice `repr` and comparisons for free.
Thanks! I'll look into it :)
Try /r/learnpython, also read the linkedin API docs. If you are doing it some other way, try googling about.
Fuck off nobody cares
My wife is pregnant and left me in charge of researching car seats and strollers. So I'm working on a quick script with a UI to interact with the CPSC's web API and return a CSV of recalls by manufacturer.
Yea thanks, your code didn't work. And I already tried your code before, I wrote it myself, so this is the second time I tried with piece of code. I was downvoted nearly to hell for asking that question in python sub.
and its not a large scale project.....its for my personal use and to learn how to http stuff works...
I’m sure i will! Thanks for being honest in your response.
Looks like you forgot a “:”
Function definitions need a colon. def my_function(): &lt;-- right there
Yeah I figured it out right after I posted it. Gonna delete my post now LOL.

&gt; Hey guys, I know this probably belongs on R/LearningPython but they don’t let you post images there. For good reason. Fuck off with this.
Kind of makes me want to break it. Like it was obviously an intentional thing to test that the robot would capitalize on it yet the robot decides to be a dick about it anyways.
Was it trying to stop you or trying to win hmmmm
Thanks for the suggestion, I will take a look at freeCAD. The stackoverflow discussion seems to be related to resizing the shape when you resize the window. What I am looking for is to resize the shape by dragging the edge with the mouse.
Thanks for the suggestion
I put some finishing touches on a (newly) distributed database load testing tool called PigDog. &amp;#x200B; This is is my first Python project to use threading, grpc, and protocol buffers. It's been a lot of fun and is a tool I'll end up using at work. Some notable features: * Can run stand alone, or in a command/control mode in conjunction with remote clients * Workloads defined using a config file and a script file, you can also have an init script that runs at the start of the test * Both the controller and the remote clients can run in docker containers * Each client can execute load tests across a user-defined number of threads, and repeat the test a user-defined number of times * At the end of a run the controller collects execution duration stats from the remote clients and displays a nice graph of execution durations in the terminal I would love some feedback (especially on my coding style in general): [https://github.com/m82labs/pigdog/](https://github.com/m82labs/pigdog/tree/master)
I am looking at FreeCAD as suggested by someone else here but it seems to be an overkill in my case. Using Kivy can we draw a rectangle and resize it by dragging one of the edges?
You did all that work and couldn't automate the robot making his next turn?
Cute, he Jack's you off at the end

OUCH. You kicked the python right in its Global Interpreter Lock.
I recently received my degree in software engineering and I'm looking to keep my skills sharp. Is this a live role? Or could I answer questions/aid whenever I have time?
I wrote it originally because I just had a very strong "yuck" response to the celery codebase. This was a number of years ago, I have changed, celery has changed...but that was the impetus. With the above disclaimer in mind, off the top of my head: * I'm pretty sure it covers most of what people use celery for: tasks, task scheduling, cronjob-like-tasks, pipelines, etc etc * No dependencies, unless you're using the Redis storage, in which case you obviously need the redis-py driver * Codebase is tiny in comparison, can easily be read in one sitting * Which means it's easier to reason about / extend / etc * Dead simple, no magic * Easy to configure with good defaults (remember I'm comparing to celery from like 7 years ago) * It is lean as hell and simple as hell. Anyone could write a basic "Huey" clone in a weekend
Good job, but I would just simply use off-the-shelf libraries such as `easydict`, etc.

Part of my systems science class required us to map out (partially) a social network that we are a part of. Knowing Python, of course, I automated this task to crawl the GitHub API to generate a directed graph for a users following/followers. You can check out the code here: [https://github.com/AlexanderJDupree/GithubNetwork](https://github.com/AlexanderJDupree/GithubNetwork) Also, here's an image the program created: [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/PpCUWxH.png)
I recognise you said you didn't want to go with an engine, but perhaps consider [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). It loads quick and has a small footprint (small for an engine). Native scripting is in a python-esque language. Alternatively, you can use Python/ C++ or other options. Uncompressed executable/application would likely be around 20 mb for a procedural 3d fly-through.
Instead of comparing the type of a value to a class with “is”, you should probably be using “isinstance”. Your way will break if someone subclasses PackedDict.
Is opencv needed for an input like this? Could you just hand implement the dsp algo's on your own with a digital filter? It's already high-contrast. I feel like you may be do it on an mcu without python and a laptop.
It works, I tried it myself before commenting.
thats cool. "config mgmt" is like "web framework", we all end up "rolling our own". dict qualifies. dict. dataclass. class. collections.namedtuple. typing.namedtuple. slots. configparser. fields. abc.mapping. thats all stdlib (probably). ofc they are different. but when u want a scoped (ah, argparse.namespace(?) is another). uh. but when u want a scoped container type with dot notation access.
Teabag included, nice
I hadn't come across that before, but good to know for future reference!
That's always an excellent point, thanks!
don't use properties like actions. they're for getting setting data. Going back/forward by accessing properties makes no sense
Please do us a favor and not comment with this sort of negativity here. If you aren't interested, why waste people's time?

In case you wanna look for tutorials, there was an entire Coursera course that taught optimization using MiniZinc. Not sure if the videos are still available though.
Yes--I'd think that would work. Essentially it would the "600" would make it no less safe than a ssh private key. Of course I believe the ssh tools implement actual checks to make sure keys are in files with correct permissions. That said--I'm still not sure if the redis-cli example was used because it really is a bit of a very low-security thing. The password is stored in the config file in plain text and communications using the cli are in plain text (including the password). Essentially the password is sort of a safe guard so other local users can't muck around with it. Put another way--it could be a useful tool if you do a lot of dev stuff and end up setting up local MySQL or MariaDBs, web servers and utilities, etc. etc. and keeping track of the various user ids and passwords is a major pain. (E.g. What user/password did I set up for the MongoDB admin? And instead just doing `rqs mongoadmin` or `rqs maria_root` or `rqs_maria_reader`.)
Very cool. This needs a timer so the operator doesn't have to trigger the robots move
winreg issue should be fixed now
I wrote a piece of software that automatically blocks anyone who gets a post from certain subreddits to /r/popular. It literally fixed /r/popular for me, I can actually read it now and not want to gouge my eyes out.
Joerogan.com
So I have a bug that you wouldn't know and I couldn't resolve it myself. and you said I have got quite the road ahead of me. Interesting, wanna lecture me computer science 101?
Or, worse yet, demotivate people who are actually making worthwhile contributions.
It wasn't meant to be taken as an insult, I was expressing my sentiments because I've also dealt with many hours debugging and learning to program, despite practicing for years. It's a fun, yet tedious battle that requires determination and tenacity. Your code wasn't formatted properly. I'm not sure if it was due to Reddit or not, so another issue may be related to that. After getting the browser to open, and load the page, the fix was as shown above. I have extensive experience with Pyppetter/Puppeteer - I developed https://github.com/mikeyy/nonocaptcha so I'm pretty confident it works. Best of luck.
Thank you, I'll try as soon as possible 😉
Nice. Maybe add popularity, and things to improve popularity. Maybe add new types of alcohol that you can purchase to increase the valuation of the tavern. Set a valuation for the appearance of the interior and exterior of the tavern so you can purchase things to increase that which would increase your popularity. Same with maybe an ad campaign. Other features could be managing staff. Maybe give the option to expand into multiple taverns. Hire managers to automate inventory control and other aspects. Maybe re write the game menu structure from scratch so you can back out and it functions like a regular game menu. You can access different categories of options in it. Logically it would be confusing to make but I might toy around with python and see if I can make something like that. That way you can add a bunch of more features without it getting too unorganized.
HAHA
Thanks for the explanation. From my own experience, a nice user facing API often comes at the cost of implementation work.
Stop using 2.7... it’s time for 3.
You are right there are other tools that do it better but this is a great idea for you to start playing with. I'm sure you will learn a lot even if you will achieve partial goal :) So yeah go ahead. My advice will be to look up a Black Python pdf. Blac_at_Pthon.pdf. I think I found it on torrents let me know if u need help.
Trying to come up with a few projects I can have my students (Grade 7 &amp; 9) work on in [repl.it](https://repl.it/) using 'Python with Turtle'. So far we have it drawing shapes with however many sides the user chooses as well as use selected line and fill colour. Might work on a nickname generator or a dice roller next.
Why doesn't 17.16 changelog include all changelog information from 17.16rc1??
Sorry, I have taken that as an insult. I will try to debug later. Thanks.
Same.
Learning Machine Learning
Hey, thanks for the library. But I'm having trouble formating the time parameter in the sink of the file. It always shows YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm-ss_SSS while I only want YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss. Is there any way we can go about this? Anyways thanks for this.

Yes because flinging a board in any other reason would be quarbone.
i think a while loop should be more appropriate in this case. probably there’s something wrong with your condition statement and that’s why it keeps looping.
You have to setup a jupyter server. Type jupyter notebook into a terminal and open your notebook within the browser page it just opened.
What would you recommend?
 value = int(input("Enter a value in range 1 to 5 inclusive: ")) print(value) while value &lt; 0 or value &gt; 5: print("Invalid input.") print("Please try again.") value = int(input("Enter a value in range 1 to 5 inclusive: ")) if 0 &lt; value &lt; 6: print(value)
If the operator takes too long to place the token, then a timer can cause injury (especially if the robot is (much) higher powered)
[removed]
In \`get\_user\_input()\` you are asking for new input, but you are not updating \`index\`. You need to do something like \`index = int(input("Please try again: "))\`.
Thank you :-)

IDLE probably does not refer tot the right (3.7) Python interperter. What happens if you start IDLE from the terminal? Check which Python version IDLE is using perhaps.
It's a fine approach, but the native Docker integration is great and honestly absolutely worth paying for.
Thanks :) I would absolutely pay for it but I think the price tag of 200eu for the first year is a bit steep.
lista = \[\[0.1, 0.3, 0.5\], \[0.6, 0.2, 0.7\], \[0.5, 1.1, 0.1\]\] suma = \[\] for lst in lista: suma.append(sum(lst)) print(suma)
A personal license is like $80/year, and gets cheaper over time as well, and that's not including student discounts and such.
What makes it so great? Half the code i write these days will eventually run inside Docker containers but I just use Vim and a Makefile. I honestly cannot imagine what remote code execution inside a Docker container would bring to the table. I promise I’m not trolling — I’m genuinely curious.
The ability to bring up a Docker container and attach the full PyCharm debugger inside it in a single click.
I can't find the 80$/year on their hp, only the 200eu/year. [Store](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/buy/#edition=commercial)
There's a second tab that says "For Individual Use".
I thought that was a headline -.- Sorry! And thanks!

I have checked `sys.version` in both the Terminal and IDLE, both return 3.7.3
Much appreciated! I have realized that google will almost rarely let me down (hasn’t yet anyways) but if it does some day, I will certainly remember this offer.
Personally I like pygame. It’s more oriented towards making games but you can do other things with it. My issue with processing’s Python mode is that it doesn’t seem to have much support and initializing variables is really weird.
Okay, so that's not the problem. You could check if the `sys.path` and perhaps `os.environ["path"]` values are the same in both the Terminal and IDLE. And what is the location of the `numpy` library you are trying to import, using `numpy.__file__` for example.
Really good work man, its nice to get something down like this, you should feel proud of yourself!
30 with two kids lol, can’t be on reddit as often as I’d like.
The webframework you use, whether it's Django or Flask or something else, really depends on your app and how much built-in you want. You should also do some research on which ones easily integrate with mongodb (I'm guessing most of them do). Jupyter Notebooks isn't really an IDE and not really suitable for coding something as extensive as a web app. Try out a bunch of Python IDEs and see which you like. I'm a fan of Pycharm, but it's pretty personal. A lot of other people like VS Code.
Building a service to notify a user when new houses (matching their criteria) are posted across various property websites. Eventually it'll send a single email to cover multiple sites so no need to sign up to multiple sites and deal with loads of separate emails! &amp;#x200B; Still in the early stages of building it and this is my first real project in Python so code is constantly changing as a result of new ideas or just learning better ways of doing things but it's exciting!
spacemacs has the goodies out of the box.[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/tree/master/layers/%2Blang/python](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/tree/master/layers/%2Blang/python)
&gt;From my understanding, the built-in list, dict, and set types have in-lined a lot of code for performance. [...] If dict and list weren’t faster this way, why would the core developers have chosen this odd implementation? It's not really inlining code that's the issue here, it's that it doesn't go through the **python-level** lookup mechanisms. Ie. even if pop calls the same C function as the one that does the delete, it wouldn't make any difference if it did so **directly**, by making a normal C function call. In order to use a user-overridden `__delitem__` function, it'd instead need to invoke the relevant python lookup machinery, which is a lot more heavyweight (ie. do a dict lookup to find the appropriate name in the class's `__dict__`, get it, check if we need to create a python frame, package your arguments as python objects, call the function, have it unpack the arguments, and **then** call that same function. That does add a fair degree of performance overhead though - it turns an operation that's 4-5 machine instructions into one involving potentially *thousands*. Given the ubiquity and importance of the dict type, that could indeed have pretty major performance implications. Plus, of course, the fact that originally, overriding dict wasn't even a possibility - python originally had a sharp distinction between C implemented types and python types, and the latter couldn't inherit from the former, so at the time, this likely wasn't even a usecase being considered in the first place.
I just found that the sys.path is different for the IDLE and Terminal, is there a specific place I should put them both or move one to?
Minimax won't bypass a win unless you literally programmed a win to be equivalent to a tie in the board evaluation function. A win is typically programmed to be a value that is higher than what the evaluation function can produce on a regular evaluation of the board and wins requiring fewer moves are worth more than wins that involve more moves. Minimax chooses the move that will lead to the highest score assuming perfect play from the opponent. There isn't counterplay to winning, so minimax will choose it every time.
It can already analyze the board, it could just check once per second and move once it detects a change on the board.
I would use something like this: def get_user_input(): error = "Invalid menu option." valid_index = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] def parse_user_input(): try: index = int(input("Enter your choice: ")) except (TypeError, ValueError): index = 100 return index # get initial index (chosen menu entry by user) index = parse_user_input() # repeat until we have a valid index while index not in valid_index: print(error) print("Please try again.") index = parse_user_input() return index But I'm not sure if you are allowed to use a nested function and the try except construction. This code checks if the index is valid and handles wrong user input (e.g. a user entering "a").
Try Vim.
I'd look into VSCode - it has a great Python plugin that supports everything you need.
What do you mean `compile programs for myself`, exactly? You can use Notepad++ to write and run code from the editor itself: check [this](https://silentcrash.com/2016/12/run-python-script-notepad/) out. Otherwise, you can use any text editor you want, open up a terminal and type `py -3 myscript.py`.
Thank you! Would there be a special interface you’d or something for graphics?
This reminds me of library mechanize.
Without the answers to my previous questions its hard to tell what is going on exactly. I don't use IDLE myself, but I would assume if you installed Anaconda and use the Anaconda installed version of IDLE and install `numpy` using conda it should all just work. Somehow the `sys.path` (PYTHON_PATH) does not include the right path to find the installed `numpy` library when using IDLE. Are you able to import any other Anaconda package when using IDLE?
I am about a year ahead of you so I've just been through this. Notepad++ may be popular with some users but it's a long way from the top of the list so I don't see any particular reason for a beginner to start there. I started with Anaconda / Spyder. Pycharm is the most widely used, and VSCode is also often suggested. I played with Pycharm CE and also VSCode. In summary, I can share the following from my experience: * Anaconda / Spyder: works out of the box, comes with almost every important library already installed. Has a GUI setup and no further config required to make it work. Comes also with Jupyter notebooks and labs and various other apps as part of the overall package. * Pycharm - deserves its spot as dev favourite. Has many more features than Spyder, none of which you will miss as a beginner. More flexible and therefore complex than Spyder. * VSCode - main advantage, very light weight. Main disadvantage, totally flexible and configurable and requires setup that just adds complexity that a beginner doesn't need. My advice, start with Anaconda/Spyder. [https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). When you get more advanced in a few months, check out Pycharm CE. You can use your existing Spyder environment in Pycharm when you switch, so it's only about the new IDE, not any new setup.
I am not entirely sure, you could probably try tkinter
Yeah, I thought that too.
Code makes sense, it changes later in next lines of code. But yes, initially every leaf is same.
Yeah, you are right.
There's barely anything here and it doesn't even rearrange solution 2 to avoid subtractive cancellation
No, I am unable to import other packages. Also, I rechecked the sys.version and whilst both return 3.7.3, one says 'default' at the start of the brackets and one says 'v3.7.3' followed by a string of numbers and letters. Does this affect anything?
You will need to judge what makes the most sense from my comment based on your experience, but for me I would break this project into chunks. I would personally break this up into two separate components, the network portion and the UI portion. Network stuff isn't easy, especially if you are only loosely familiar. Django isn't easy if its your first time because you need to learn all about MCV and how it all fits together to get something rendered. I would choose one maybe two things you want to display on your website. It really doesn't matter what, maybe something local like your IP address and something remote like the number of detected computers. Keep it simple and small and you can build up the features as you get more experience and comfortable. I would start with the network portion as just a basic script. I would not worry about passing in dynamic inputs, just hard code things and figure out how to get the information you want to display. I would then continue to modify this script so it had classes which will make your life easier with django. After you have that, I would move onto the django portion. Get something really basic setup following their tutorial they have on their website. It is a really good starting place to get an idea of how it works. I would keep it really basic, using just pure HTML and very little CSS if any. I also wouldn't do any Javascript because it just adds complexity. Once you're feeling comfortable with your Django app displaying what you think it should. Ask yourself what did you find fun and make improvements there. You always learn better when you're enjoying it, so focus on that portion and build out from those improvements.

Automate the boring stuff was enough for me. There is a website with all the info on too. But I have prior experience of programming in another language.
I kind of get the feeling that you have two Python 3.7.3 environments installed. The Anaconda environment and a default OS environment. Whats the output of `sys.executable` for both cases?

 my_dict["current_half_result"]["home"]["value"] = "foo" assert (my_dict["current_half_result"]["home"]["value"] == my_dict["full_time_over_under"]["$2_5"]["over"]["value"]) for key, value in my_dict.items(): if value == template_dict: print("{} {}".format(key, value["value"])) elif isinstance(value, dict): for key2, value2 in value.items(): if value2 == template_dict: print("{} {}".format(key2, value2["value"])) elif isinstance(value2, dict): for key3, value3 in value2.items(): print("{} {}".format(key3, value3["value"]))
That would make sense if the initial line becomes: template_dict = None
If you are going to be the only user then jupyter is fine. However, if you expect other users to also use your application, the you will need a web framework. If that is the case then Django is perfectly fine. Keep in mind you'll also need to boost your app somewhere for other people to access it.
Then come back here and ask how to exit vim
Presently watching a course on Python 3 programming and I'm in the planing stage of my first program which is a media metadata utility for my next project which is a media center frontend/manager.
The learning python book by O'Reilly is excellent. It covers all the basics in a clear and detailed manner.
Did you use any particular resources to learn python?
1. /r/learnpython 2. Look into `str.split`
Hello! I'm a bot! I see someone has already suggested going to r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. I highly recommend posting your question there. Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster. Show /r/learnpython the code you have tried and describe where you are stuck. **[Be sure to format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F)** and include which version of python and what OS you are using. You can also ask this question in the [Python discord](https://discord.gg/3Abzge7), a large, friendly community focused around the Python programming language, open to those who wish to learn the language or improve their skills, as well as those looking to help others. *** [^(README)](https://github.com/CrakeNotSnowman/redditPythonHelper) ^(|) [^(FAQ)](https://github.com/CrakeNotSnowman/redditPythonHelper/blob/master/FAQ.md) ^(|) ^(this bot is written and managed by /u/IAmKindOfCreative) ^(This bot is currently under development and experiencing changes to improve its usefulness)
Getting there:) You do have two Python 3.7.3 environments and your using an IDLE version which is installed with/in the OS Python environment. I believe IDLE is installed with Anaconda as well (I don't use IDLE or Anaconda so I'm not 100% sure). If so you need to find the IDLE executable which comes with Anaconda, perhaps this helps: [https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/integration/idle/](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/integration/idle/). Maybe another question, why do you need IDLE in the first place? I don't know IDLE that well but is it not just a simple text editor and a Python shell bundled? In that case you could just use any text editor (Atom, VS Code or even Emacs, Vim etc.) and the normal python shell, or even better the ipython shell.
So basically every http request to your site leads to an api call in the backend? Would that not really affect response time? Or are you using some means to cache results (I have heard a few terms with respect to this but dont know how they work)
 list2d = [[0.1, 0.3, 0.5], [0.6, 0.2, 0.7], [0.5, 1.1, 0.1]] list(map(sum, list2d))
&gt; How do you do this? Where do I start? That's really broad, but from the headline of the post, I think you are completely unfamiliar with web. For what you are doing, I would look at [chalice](https://chalice.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This can help you setup a very cost effective service that will always be on and will alleviate anneed to mess around with servers.
You could use a code-server if you want web-based IDE. It's very comfortable between multiple platforms, computers. I use it for developing Flask based rest API, but it also works fine with frontend applicitaions too. It's a fully functional (almost) Visual Studio code on your browser.

1. /r/learnpython 2. `str.split` sounds good &amp;#8203; # This is what you read from the serial port arduino_string = "945,512,834" # parse into a list of integers numbers = [int(n) for n in arduino_string.split(",") # or get the individual values straight away joy_x, joy_y, pot = [int(n) for n in arduino_string.split(",")]
Python for VS Code installed? It should work with any library. Where did you install pygame? To the virtualenv, \~python2 or \~python3? Try to select other interpreter by using CTRL+SHIFT+P start typing select interpreter.
Good bot.
At the moment yes every http request triggers a call to the API, fortunately the nature of the data is that I can make a single request for each page and then break up the data so its not costing multiple hits per request at least. The cache stuff is one of my more long term investigation items because there is no real need to poll say schedule data each request when it, just have to work out the specific mechanics of the caching
Wow, you're intended 6 levels and I have to read the entire code before I know what it does. Did you consider moving some of that logic into a second function?
I've seen enough industrial robot videos that I got a little nervous when you moved your arm directly through the work area of its ~~laser cutter / hole punch / welding torch~~ suction cup.
Check out the interactive fiction communities, and also the MUD games sites (mud = multiuser dungeon; a text based mmo)
yeah, the code could use some cleaning up but it was part of the 100 days of code challenge so I wanted to keep it as simple as possible and the first time it ran I left it at that.
Good news: We got it working. You made my entire year, since I've been trying to get this working for a couple of days now. Thank you soooo much for helping to diagnose the problem for me. (:
A little while ago Ned also tried mutmut: https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201903/mutmut.html &gt; As another data point about the cost of mutation testing, I tried mutmut on another project with a 10-second test suite. It took mutmut 43 minutes to run 513 mutants, of which 165 survived. Combine that with the fact that there's no way to mark known false-positives so you'll get the same false-positivies every run. I see no reason to even bother trying this on any project. In its current state it's too slow* and requires too much manual checking for false-positives. \* but we could run it nightly on a server. Yes we could. But it would probably take hours and I want code to be tested before merging pull requests. &gt;16 seconds sounds like a lot compared to the 3s above, but let’s remember that we didn’t have to write the test above either, and I’ll bet you can’t come up with that test AND write it correctly in under 16 seconds! I want developers to be able to test their code themselves in a reasonable way. The article makes it sound like mutmut will take care of testing our edge cases. But with this speed I don't see it viable.
exactly
Was a big fan of Sublime Text, for my Python development, but recently explored PyCharm for its Docker integration, and I don't see myself going back! The fact that you can simply click a button and go straight to the debugger, is amazing, and a huge time saver. It also integrates with Docker Compose, so if you have multiple Docker containers, it allows you to integrate everything nicely.
Oh cool, was unaware of that sub. Thanks!
Thank you! This is great!
Yes, updates will be phased out. If you have no need for updates or external libraries being updated, stick to python 2. Otherwise you may want to consider porting the project
You dropped a `]` at the end of line 4.
Are there exposed APIs for all your external sources?
 value = None while value not in range(1, 6):
TONS of people make that mistake. I have no clue why they haven't made the personal licenses the default tab after all these years.
I just did a python2-3 port on a fairly large codebase. It was a lot of work, now that its done I'm glad. However, if I was just joining a team I don't think my first priority would be to tell them to port from python2 to python3. If you are intent on doing it, the best way is to do it slowly. Write any code that you touch to be python3/2 compatible and as you come across stuff refactor to be compatible with both. I personally made a separate branch and went full python3 and dropped python2 support completely. Another thing to consider is what versions of docker and and ansible are they working with. I found the API's had changed a bit when doing the upgrade.
Unfortunately not - web scraping is involved where APIs do not exist (or are terrible/deprecated). I've seen a good few posts about scraping/using APIs for cars, too! Can be done for whatever you like if the info is out there on the web!

Why is idle not deprecated?
Nice!
&gt; Combine that with the fact that there's no way to mark known false-positives so you'll get the same false-positivies every run. Dude. You REALLY should read the documentation or something before stating as fact something that isn't true. https://mutmut.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#whitelisting The docs are super tiny, you could have read the table of contents at least! Plus, yea it takes 43 minutes for that project *on the first run*. If you run it again with no code changes and no test changes, it takes ~1 second. It never checks killed mutants and it just checks surviving mutants on *changed lines*. The average time (unless you delete the cache every time) is WAY WAY lower than 43 minutes. &gt; But it would probably take hours and I want code to be tested before merging pull requests. And mutmut even supports running just against lines that are present in a patch file! So you can run mutations on just the changed lines. This is a bit experimental, and not yet in the docs due to no one having tried it in a production setting and reported back yet.
Why are you trying to read PEPs?
