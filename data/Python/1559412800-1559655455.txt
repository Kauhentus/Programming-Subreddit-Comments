How are you installing packages, with `pip install`?
pip install package-name
`pip` knows nothing about `Pipfile`s. You probably want `pipenv install package-name` instead.
Okay, I knew there had to be something. Let me try that real quick then. As well as go harrass anyone with any post with the words "pipenv" inside google searches.
It won't help, IDLE just can't display emoji.
The answer is: don't use IDLE.
yeah, i guess. What IDEs do you reccomend/use?
PyCharm is really good. Or Visual Studio Code.
nevermind, answered my own question. Thanks! Geezus I feel like an idiot today
Thanks, i'll definitely check them out!
\+1 Even use PyCharm for quick scripting
Fun fact: it can’t be the first either.
I used to use PyCharm but know I use VScode exclusively. PCharm is just to heavy.
Even used for text formatting in temporary files, that good.
Thanks, I will

Do a search. This question is asked *very* frequently.
Agreed. Common courtesy is best applied to 99% of all interactions. This has been addressed before I started but a valid point. Regarding the ownsherip of the data, I disagree. The source is the custodian, by allowing a public facing site access, they implicitly allow us ownership. By your line of thought, if you went to weather.com and saw it was supposed to be 10 degrees Fahrenheit, your not allowed to wear sweaters/jackets? You have to step outside first?
aalib has a demo called [bb](http://aa-project.sourceforge.net/bb/) that shows some great performance.
Meh... You should abide by the txt but I also think it's responsible to reach out for guidance as well.
Neat! I didn't realize that, but I guess you probably can't do live video feed from the camera through VLC.
I thought about trying to get more accuracy by strategically using ' &amp; , for upper and lower pixels, but that seems like a lot more work than I'm willing to put in and I like how simple it is right now.
Mostly for handling spectral data, ie get a 2D [long slit image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-slit_spectroscopy) or a 3D data cube (see: [intégral field spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_field_spectrograph)). Most astronomical packages are generally dependant in some way on [AstroPy](https://www.astropy.org/) modules and tailored from there to suit more specific needs: for example there's no real "one size fits all" method for removing background/continuum/stellar contributions from images, so I generally utilise my own routines in that regard. For my field, some of the really useful code is in Fortran, which handles heavy numerical operations way faster than python, but it requires special formats for input files which I've recently been working to kind of automate with python (inspired by /u/plasma_phys [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b5pyj5/whats_the_best_automation_youve_done_with_python/ejfd13n)) so I can run diagnostics more quickly. That's a work in progress though, heh.
I used to work in this field, you really don't need to
Wow, that must be fun!
So let me throw a scenario at you... You'd rather scrape on your own accord than reach out to the site? What if they'd prefer you use an underlying API? You'd still scrape?
It has been tested and it works
Fun — and frustrating! But that's the joy of learning: nothing seems to go right sometimes and you spend an age trying to figure out why, haha. But eventually you figure it out and it's great!
Taking for 10 minutes is SO hard. I'll keep this in mind for next time haha!
Ha ha. No worries !!
The command to start python3 is `python3`.
How about just not using those features?
Thanks!!!
But then x is a float, and in OP's example it is typed as an int. If your code is highly optimized then you want to avoid the extra cast.
&gt; Intellectual property, website terms of use American nonsense
I'd poke around the network traffic first (chrome's network tab for example). You can usually discern if there's an underlying api on your own. By reaching out to them you're basically telling them "Hey, get ready to block me".
Makes sense
the actual irony of you pointing out intolerance 😂
Floating point literals are bad practice when you need integers, yes.

Well what are you doing here, arguing still? Just shut up, your argument doesn't apply here.
Most likely you have some whitespace in there. Print out the keys. I'll guess the key is " Number" with a space in there somewhere.
I've been working on a module to facilitate live plotting of sensor data (original goal was to live plot Arduino data). I extend matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation to allow axis auto-rescaling with blitting as well as simplify plot creation by using the update\_function's signature to generate subplots as needed. I also made a (much) faster Qt implementation to compare with. [github.com/adriangb/easy\_animation](https://github.com/adriangb/easy_animation)
You can, set it to render using ASCII and then just "Open capture device".
Yeah. It's almost shocking how little code is involved in this version. Nicely done. ([Obligatory relevant XKCD](https://xkcd.com/353/))
Test adding the axis paramater in sort_values (... sort_values(by=['Number'], axis=1)) in case it tries to sort the rows (axis=0) instead of columns (axis=1). On mobile can't easily test myself.
Alright man. Good ideas.
Some people don't like `Pipenv` due to its slow locking, conflict resolution problems, and drama associated with its author. There's a competing package called `Poetry`. Some people don't see the need for these tools, and prefer to handle virtual envs and packages separately. Follow your heart.
Not OP but have been trying to accomplish same feat (with less success). U could use this emulator http://www.fceux.com/web/home.html Which support lua scripting language. Basically you start the emulator from within python and pass lua script as argument. The script should open a socket and take/send commands from your python code and give it to the emulator I found the implementation online but on phone now
Thank you. I have been trying to accomplish same feat using reinforcement learning and dqn with little success. Your post came in the right time
&gt; sort\_values(by=\['Number'\], axis=1)) thanks for the reply! It did not work as it resulted in... \# Check for duplicates KeyError: 'Number'
Just a guess but maybe check for white space in the column name. Bit me before
&gt;Also, it's pretty hard to defend "1\_000\_000" as 'more beautiful' or 'simpler' than "1e6". It sure as hell is simpler, I don't have learn an entire new god damn way of writing numbers.
I use Java at work, so I'm not familiar with production python either. What's so bad about requirements.txt? You specify all of your project's dependencies after all, and are able to install them. I'll have a look at that pipenv though
I don't know that there is anything bad about it. I have never used it, that's all.
There is also `requirements-dev.txt` for the dev side of dependencies.
 [http://kidscancode.org/lessons/](http://kidscancode.org/lessons/) &amp;#x200B; Go thru the 3 pygame walkthru videos then go do what you want
If your code were highly optimized it would not be written in Python, but okay.
I tried to use pipenv for a project and got errors I didn't understand or know how to solve, so I resumed using requirements.txt and venv.
Dude this is great. I do a lot of work on headless machines and I've been trying to write a pyplot ascii plotting package for a while and it was very cumbersome to do. Now I know how to seriously simplify it, thank you.
That opinion has been successfully legally challenged a few times. Especially in the case that the ToS explicitly prevents use of their data for profit.
Well, done! I would love to see a video playthrough of each level showing each iteration concurrently.
As far as I'm aware Pipenv was built to overcome the limitations of requirements.txt. Before Pipenv the way you ensured a deterministic build is through using `pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt` which would pin all the packages, their dependencies and their version numbers. This meant that you could run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in a virtual environment to recreate the exact environment in a different machine. The problem comes when upgrading the packages, it is a nontrivial problem (and quite tedious) to do this upgrade manually making sure nothing breaks. This was the reason Pipenv was created which guarantees deterministic build using the `Pipfile.lock` file. It also aims to make it much easier to create a virtual environment and run code in that virtual environment. I can't say how successfully it does all this since I haven't used it much. If you're already using it then I don't see why you need to bother with `requirements.txt` unless the end user isn't interested in installing `pipenv` and prefers to manage their virtual environments manually or they use other similar tools like `poetry`.
&gt; which still looks wrong to me after five years... I think Dutch or French writes thousands seperators like this. Its not like they decided for ' as seperator out of the blue. It was syntactically fitting and used in the real world.
I'm using Geany on Ubuntu 16.04. Very light and breezy.
Aye, but what if the ToS does not? I can assure you what I'm doing is 100% legal (hence why I didn't post this a legal themed sub), do you have any comments of value towards the topic originally stated or would you rather continue as a developer/lawyer?
Just tried this myself; if the underscore is the final character, you'll have a problem.
Just set yourself a simple project/goal what you want to make with pygame and google as you go along what you need
I have no need for pipenv. Shoot, I don’t use requirements.txt either because it’s too limited. I use setup.py with as large a range on my dependencies as I can.

There is no way I'm typing out 18 zeros by hand, no matter how convenient the notation is. I'll rather use type casting int(1e18) &gt;&gt;&gt; int(1e18) + 1 == int(1e18) False
This is the best way to learn anything new imo.
It says the key Number doesn't exist, but it's hard to say without looking at the source Excel file. I guess the key has some encoding or whitespace in it that is not a in the key you pass it.
I'm certainly not a pro but here's my take: As a developer, which language I'm using is largely irrelevent. I can use Python, Java, C++, C#, whatever to get the job done. The libraries available for whatever I'm doing are more important. In my mind, Python is best suited for scripting, machine learning, and data analysis. The latter two because of widespread support and libraries. If I'm building a desktop application, I'm far more likely to use C# or C++. If I'm building an android App I'll use Java or Kotlin. If I'm writing a website I'll probably use Angular. You can do all of these in python, but is it the best tool for this application? Probably not. The good news is, once you understand the core concepts, you'll have very little issues switching between languages. I got hired as an intern with no knowledge of C# or Angular. I learned both in the span of a week. Am I an expert now? No, not even close. But I know enough, of both these languages and programming in general, to use google to fill in the gaps.
You may want to use postgres or at least MariaDB
Yeah, I am aware. But I am betting he will port it to python3. He needs the spotlight.
I wish I could tell you how to do this but I’m early on in learning. I would recommend posting this on r/learnpython this sub Reddit is more for posting finished projects I believe
Why not just write `10**18`? There's no runtime overhead to it because the CPython bytecode compiler does constant folding: &gt;&gt;&gt; import dis &gt;&gt;&gt; def foo(): ... return 10**18 ... &gt;&gt;&gt; dis.dis(foo) 2 0 LOAD_CONST 1 (1000000000000000000) 2 RETURN_VALUE

Definitely possible and probably not terribly difficult. Is there an easier way to do it? Absolutely. Set up a NextCloud server on AWS, GCP or DigitalOcean. Or use Google Drive. If you're looking for a challenge though, then go for it! You'll probably want to get to know the FTP module very well. 😏

you can pass in keyword arguments to .format(), ie, "vm\_uuid={vm} static-min={ram}MiB dynamic-min={ram}MiB dynamic-max={ram}MiB static-max={ram}MiB".format(vm=vm\_uuid, ram=ram)
That's really cool. &amp;#x200B; Regarding the extensions, have you considered treating this as a \[n-body\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body\_problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem)) problem? These would be pretty similar except the force pushes bodies \*away\* from each other rather than towards. Drawing an analogy between your elevator problem and n-bodies : &amp;#x200B; * The shape of the container doesn't matter. * A "stinky" person has a greater mass. So the "force" pushing people away from those people is greater * With a repulsive force people move away from each other... so are more likely to "lean" on the side of the elevator &amp;#x200B; Further the n-body problem has some pretty neat algorithmic solutions, avoiding the O(n\^2) steps required to find the force between all passengers e.g. \[Barnes-Hut\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes%E2%80%93Hut\_simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes%E2%80%93Hut_simulation)) which gives an O(nlogn) solution.

There was a post trending about a month ago that talked about how Kenneth (pipenv author) raised over 30K to develop a new version of his even more popular package "requests" and once that money was raised, has never been talked about since. Yes he is narcissistic and very hard to work with as well that has been mentioned.
I think you can use the "git clone" and the "python setup.py bdist\_egg" commands described here. [https://lxml.de/build.html#github-git-and-hg](https://lxml.de/build.html#github-git-and-hg) Be sure to use the right version of python when you run the setup, or even better, build a virtualenv using that version. If the tests run ok, "python test.py" , then you could try pip installing the egg file and then the flask server, etc.
So you're saying that if I put one in the the front, and one in the back, they cancel out and start working. Or can you not put one in the back either?
That's disgusting *upvotes*
This should be pretty straightforward. Learn about ftp, follow the steps you have already outlined, break it down to smaller tasks and work on them.

You pymadlad, you!
Just from looking at the courses listed I'd say you want to start with the "From 0 to 1" course and the "Python Mega Course" course and then take the courses you're most interested in afterwards.
Is pipenv the one that requires you to be in your project directory to run code? I really dislike that. Seems like it puts more burden on the user to keep track of their current state than virtualenv that just keeps track of the PATH for you and adds the name to your prompt. And it greatly reduces the usefulness of console_script entry points
Don't know if it does that. At any rate I moved to poetry, loads better than pipenv.
[https://gizmodo.com/playing-tetris-on-a-business-card-is-everything-i-hoped-1794176951](https://gizmodo.com/playing-tetris-on-a-business-card-is-everything-i-hoped-1794176951)
Do you activate the environment? Or does it detect your environment based on what directory you're in?
noice!
You have to activate it.
Also if you "import curses as c" then use c instead, you save 5 characters everywhere curses is used.
&gt; guarantees deterministic build using the Pipfile.lock file There's so much that can go wrong it's pretty far from deterministic. At least it lets you know the resulting venv is not equivalent to the specified one, which is quite common.
Okay, cool. I've never had a reason to use anything other than the standard setup.py and requirements.txt (I've developed maybe a dozen installable packages). I hope this non-standard setup doesn't cause you problems later on. Good luck!
Agreed. You'd want to master the fundamentals before tackling any large projects. The programs themselves benefit from a strong foundation.
It works! I had to import the curses module, but it indeed works! &amp;#x200B; Great job OP!
Why would it? If it did then no one would ever use these things.
99.9% of developers don't.
Sorry but I doubt that's true. If there ever was a made up statistic this is one. I don't know what your aim is here, but if you're here to hate on this tools you will be disappointed.
You can either activate it, using `pipenv shell`, and have the bin in your PATH (adds a name to your PS1) or not activate it and run stuff according to pwd, using `pipenv run`. Pipenv uses venv.
happy cake day - take my upvote!
Even requests, started by the same person as pipenv, has a setup.py file. They manually add the dependencies there, seperate from their pipenv files. There's just no getting away from it. It's the standard. If pip install fails to resolve your dependencies, it will fail for all of your users. Tox will test that your pip install process works. You can safely depend on none of your users using poetry or pipenv. I don't care about pipenv or poetry. I just don't want a newby thinking they are commonly used or that they can rely on their users using them. It's much more off the beaten path, and everyone needs to learn what's on the beaten path of they're going to write packages used by others.
Here's my business card, the code on it is an entire game. Here are 2000 more business cards with the interpreter and the venv. Looking forward to hearing from you!
In most projects I've parts of when performance is an issue, we would be using some libraries with C extension which is unavailable with PyPy. So I've never used PyPy in production.

And I made a challenge for myself to finish the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) in just a single week and I'm on the fourth or fifth day with almost %90 finished. Making management systems (for hotels, hospitals, stores, etc.) is on high demand in my country and the best of all is that EVERYBODY here uses the most outdated technologies like VB 6 and Delphi to name a few. &amp;#x200B; Here is the source code for anyone who wants to possibly make money off of it or hopefully develop it with me or, even better, does both [https://github.com/HatisEm/HotelManagementSystem](https://github.com/HatisEm/HotelManagementSystem) &amp;#x200B; Note: it contains duplicate code which I made on purpose for structure reasons (habit, I guess?). Gonna clean it after completing it.
I would prefer scientific notation in this case, because it is more compact. I'm not saying other notations are invalid, it's just that scientific notation is more convenient for dealing with larger numbers. Some common examples of large numbers appearing in physics/chemistry: Avogadro's number (which is strictly an integer) = `6.022e23`, Planck's constant = `6.626e-34`, various elastic moduli are of the order of `1e10` to `1e11`, etc. Imagine going through the pain of writing out Avogadro's number as `60_221_408_577_400_000_000_000_000_000_000_000` :P In the end, it doesn't even matter. As long as you can write code in a readable way for yourself and for your peers.

Oh right, I totally forgot about that subreddit, thanks for the tip
Thanks! :) Yup, I should be finished wrapping up the battleship project in the next 2-4 days and once I'm finished I'll be posting a video for that project as well.
Alrighty, sounds great! I'm almost finished with my first draft of the battleship game and will make sure to pm you the repo once it's finished.
What about using docker to run your bot with the official python image (https://hub.docker.com/_/python) ? Could be an easier alternative than installing 3.7 directly onto the pi.
No one gives a fuck about yours either, and yet, here you are.
&gt; Your last sentence makes my point for me. You have no point. Yes, I don't write my code for any 'reader'.
&gt; learn an entire new god damn way of writing numbers I weep for your education. People, seriously? Scientific notation is so hard to understand? Fuck me.
How about you shut the fuck up, you have no argument at all.
&gt; 2e6 This. And you know why? Because if you are writing stuff in the scientific community, 'most people' have absolutely no issue with scientific notation.
Plus it doesn't work in Python 3.5 anyway, so it's not like I personally have a choice.
Yes, sure.
If you can, then use ffmpeg. It can also be called using command line, so you wont have to write the whole script for it.

Yeah I know nobody gives a fuck about my code so I never mentioned it lol. Fucking moron.
I recommend pluralsight "python fundamentals" and "beyond fundamentals". Also, if you want people to review youe code, put it on Github and share the link. There's no other way around this if you want good advice. 😊
I didn't mention anything specific from my code either, I said that what I do works for me. And just because some code monkeys think scientific notation is complicated does not make it bad.
I mean you're the one with massive downvotes. Did you consider that maybe you're wrong and that you should shut the fuck up? Maybe if you didn't come off sounding like a massive douchebag people would be nicer, but you're not only wrong you're also being a fuckhead.
You have readers. You just don't give them any consideration when you write your code. I'd thank you not to lecture me about what is or is not consistent with the Zen of Python. &gt; Readability counts.
Really Cool!!!
 あなたはポイントを逃しました
&gt; You have readers. I have an extremely low number of readers, all of which have absolutely no issue with scientific notation.
Given how inaccurately (dishonestly?) you interpreted that simple question, right now I am seriously concerned about the code you write. 2e6 could just be what you intended. The reader would have to know it wasn't what you intended to spot the error. 20\_000\_00 stands out as obviously wrong to everyone.
&gt; Did you consider that maybe you're wrong No. Because I'm not. Using scientific notation is the right way to go in the places where I use it, and a bunch of code monkeys complaining about how they can't read it will most certainly not change that. &gt; Maybe if you didn't come off sounding like a massive douchebag That's on purpose, asshole. If people start off being massively condescending, I have 0 incentive to be nice to them either.
Based on your video, it looks like you are not implementing the must jump rule. https://www.itsyourturn.com/t_helptopic2030.html#helpitem1303
Oh you're literally just talking about typos. Cool, so 20_000_00 stands out as obviously wrong, does 10_000_000?
Correct, I felt like it made the game less enjoyable.
Here you go: from scipy import constants as c c.Avogadro ** c.Planck
So if you scrape a video off YouTube and repost it on your website, is that stealing?
Telling.
Zillow has an API so you could start there.
Pipenv isn't meant to build packages (though it is possible to maintain some development environment I guess, as seen in Requests). Developing packages is possible Poetry, and you don't have to maintain a separate setup.py - Poetry creates that for you when you build the package. Users of that library pip install it like any other library, and there's no "evidence" that it's a poetry developed library. For me (and the team I work with), tools like Poetry simplifies the workflow and makes it easier to contribute to other projects or setup an environment anew without having to copy lines from the readme to get the project in working order. I think the benefit is that those projects will have a standardized development workflow.
Try the product. If you prefer it, use it. If the project forks due to team disintegration, you'll be able to switch to the fork easily enough (if necessary). People pay too much attention to drama.
That's actually really neat. I didn't know SciPy had a constants database. Thanks!
&gt; there's a zillion ways of having mistakes that aren't immediately obvious. I would say that's a reason for not making more than you need to. Never thought I'd meet a person disagreeing with that. Do you argue against readable variable names too? I mean, there's a zillion other ways that your code can be obscure, so adding another isn't THAT big a deal.
Yeah again, 1e7 is more readable to me than using a bunch of underscores, and that argument only gets stronger as the numbers get bigger.
How do I download numpy?
Don't get pissy with me. You're the one who said you don't write your code for those who'd read it. You're advocating other people ought to follow your example for no other reason than it "works" in your _very specific situation_.
'pip install numpy' in your working directory!
No I'm not, I said personally I'd do this, because it works for me. And it might work for others. I didn't tell people they should definitely do this instead, that part is entirely your interpretation.
And typos destroy careers: [https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2018/07/a-one-letter-typo-is-in-part-the-reason-aliens-colonial-marines-sucked/](https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2018/07/a-one-letter-typo-is-in-part-the-reason-aliens-colonial-marines-sucked/)
Sounds like they should have been using some underscores.
If you want to find gradients that work with your own fonts you can try this bit of code: import subprocess import json #Grab a good sample of Unicode characters unicodestring = "".join([chr(s) for s in range(32,127)])+"".join([chr(s) for s in range(162,191)]) #Create a png for each character using imagemagick for i,character in enumerate(unicodestring): subprocess.run(["convert", "-background","black", "-fill","white", \ "-font", "Noto-Sans-Mono-Regular", "-pointsize","72",\ "label:"+character, "{}.png".format(i)]) #Measure the mean brightness of each character in the png and save as a dict #Brightness is measured with imagemagick meanbrightness = {} for i, character in enumerate(unicodestring): cmd = ["identify", "-format", "\"%[fx:mean]\"", "{}.png".format(i)] meanbrightness[character]=subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE).communicate()[0].decode("utf-8") brightjson = json.dumps(meanbrightness) f = open("meanbrightness.json","w") f.write(brightjson) f.close() This will give a jsn file that has the mean brightness of each character in the unicodestring. Just use your own font, and maybe mess with the range of the characters in unicodestring.

Awesome! And good to note [Tetris turns 35 this week](https://www.engadget.com/2019/06/02/tetris-35th-birthday/). Perhaps try using a block character (e.g. █) instead of #? Might look a little more parsable to the human eye

Your error means that you have input that doesn't have the right shape with respect to the shape of the weights. Without really trying to understand what you are trying to do, since it's the weekend and all that, I think that the issue is likely your weights needing to have shape (3,) and not (3,1). They are the same total size but the broadcasting rules are different.
So... You'd probably want to do Z='' For... Z += (string you wanna add) print(z) If you want to make each item an individual instance, use a list Z=[] For... Z.append(string you wanna add) print(z.join('')) (Or ''.join(z), I can never remember the syntax) If you're dead set on making each a separate variable then you'd have to use the 'global' array which stores all your variables Z=1 For... global['part %s' % z] = string Print(part1+...)
Great work!!
First you should post the code as code block, for example: compressed = "12W1B12W3B24W1B14W" j = len(compressed) for i in range (int(j)): l = 1 a = 0 for a in range (int(l)): if compressed[a]== 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 or 0: a=a+1 l= l+1 else: l = l+1 decompressing = (int(((str(a))+(str(l))))+1) Which keeps indentation in place and then it is easier to see what you meant. The indentation you see above is just how i imagine it could look like. &amp;#x200B; The problem you highlighted: ((str(part))+str(z))=(str(compressed[a+1])*decompressing) Is that you are trying to make variables "part1", "part2", ... using other variables which will not work. You may use some list to keep multiple parts together, but this will not work. Also multiple condition like this: compressed[a]== 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 or 0: will not work, 'or' operator has low precedence, so only compressed\[a\]== 1 is checked properly, others are not. To do this correctly you need to use: compressed[a] == 1 or compressed[a] == 2 or ... or compressed[a] in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0] There might be other problems, but this is what i see just by looking at it.

Take a look here: [https://www.reddit.com/wiki/markdown#wiki\_code\_blocks\_and\_inline\_code](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/markdown#wiki_code_blocks_and_inline_code) If you use new redesign on PC , there is "Code block" option hidden under three dots, without redesign, I believe you put \`\`\` (3 backticks ) on line before and after the code.

You are defining logfile inside your netstat function but calling logfile close() outside that function. Add logfile = None somewhere above your netstat function and it should work

No. The deepcopy and the for loop are subjected to the GIL. You have to get out of python to avoid the GIL.
Never used the autogui library but I suspect it's because your button only has a starting x y coordinates and no ending. It's trying to draw a box with no end.
Alright, GIL aside, I suppose it gives me a form of parallelism while each func call is waiting for network IO. Is this correct?
I don't know quite how you're trying to do it. Go here and download the file. The website is kinda messed up, but here is the direct link [https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.3/python-3.7.3-amd64.exe](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.3/python-3.7.3-amd64.exe) &amp;#x200B; I'd be very surprised if you need service pack 1, but you're asking for vulnerabilities if you don't have it. Stay up to date. &amp;#x200B; Also /r/learnpython
congratulations on your victory , I'm absolutely thrilled for you.
Completely missed it first time, you're not calling the netstat function anywhere
I have def netstat(): Is that not enough or how should I word it?
Def netstat () defines the function but doesn't run it. You can run it by calling it, add netstat() above your line output=subprocess.... And that will call the function
You'd be better off using async. joblib is a fancy wrapper around multiprocessing geared towards scientific computing and not calculating the same result twice. Async is really nice when there is network/file IO and your system is waiting for a response. That's very different from overloading cores with work.
I can't put one in the back, no.

Excellent, that works for making the .txt files now. One final question: https://i.imgur.com/kQrkQdC.jpg I still get the log 'close' error, and the .txt file is blank. Am I missing another syntax?
Totally off topic, but do yourself a favour and never ever use from &lt;package&gt; import \*.
This is possible, but rather advanced. The first thing you need to figure out is where in the cloud this is going to be stored. You would then need to figure out how to talk to that service from your python program. Here's an example. Say you decide to store the files on amazon's cloud file storage platform (called s3). You'd first need to open an account with them. I think they give you a year for free. Then you'd need to install a python library called boto which lets you talk to s3. Then you'd need to write a python program that uses boto to upload or download files from s3. Finally, you'd need some sort of log file, or a database stored in the cloud that you can check to tell if someone else is using the file.
I agree, this does seem possible.
Argh, thanks a lot. Do you suggest using async functions from multiprocessing eg `mp.map_async` or should I use `asyncio` ? Again, thanks a lot for the help!
You are not writing anything to the file. You need to add something like logfile.write(line). You will be getting the error with close because you are calling it inside a for loop which means it's being called for every line. To correct this you need to unindent that line so it's outside the for loop
I would write you an example but on my phone at the minute
Yes. Threads are fine for IO workloads. Asyncio and coroutines may be better if you plan to send more than, say, 100 requests at the same time.
I have really enjoyed several of Michael Kennedy's courses at Talk Python Training (he's the guy who hosts the Talk Python to me podcast). [https://training.talkpython.fm/](https://training.talkpython.fm/) &amp;#x200B; (Note: I have no affiliation to him, just really liked his courses)
My advice would be to precisely write the text of your video before recording your voice, your video's quality would get a huge bump if you got rid of the hesitation ! (It's still very good) In my opinion your video seemed more like a lecture than what we can search for on YouTube, maybe take a look at the channel 3blue1brown these guys are really great and they did a series of video on ML as well (you can also check Code Bullet). However, if you want to keep this lecture style maybe seeing you face would be better.
merged. thanks for the contribution!
No problem, I'll see if I can Google the rest. Appreciate your help.
Ah yes, time for the daily "What IDE should I use?" thread...
It is basically some maths like linear algebra calculus etc carried out in a computer. You can build a nn in frameworks like pytorch and tensorflow without knowing the math part. I used Google colab while I am studying. Kaggle will come very useful to you.
I prefer my networks strictly partisan.
The notepad++ champion we never deserved
I've seen this done in multiple tutorials. What's the reason for not using it and what would you do instead?
Theres a reason for that, notepad++ is light weight. The code is continuously taking screenshots of the browser and checking for object every frame. Should really be using VS or PyCharm for such basic stuff!
It looks too much like a lecture. Could have used some column name for data and output like whether or not going to a party and made it easier. ( Availability of friends, Rainy or not , crush coming or not, etc as attributes). It was good but no offense, there are better videos available.

Not the parent but I'll take a stab: It pollutes the namespace and makes it difficult to ascertain where functions come from, for instance, how many define an "add" method? What to use instead: If you find the package name unwieldy then use "import X as Y" instead. Usual example would be "import numpy as np", if you're averse to typing.
Removing Audio: You can extract the video stream without re-encoding (pretty fast &lt;1sec) for .mp4 videos. Google that and tell me what you found. Concatenating: It's a very easy job if all the videos are of the same dimensions. Google the concat/demux filters. Tell me what you found. FFmpeg vs moviepy: moviepy is based on FFmpeg. However, it is very slow, I believe this is because it saves all the variables till before rendering (lots of space and reading/writing for videos longer than a few seconds). I used FFmpeg with Python using a library called FFmpy, worked fine for me.
I'd use asyncio. That's exactly what it was designed for.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk Checkout this video and its second part. It helped me to develop an intuition.
Uhm... you should test if you got the right password in the password generating loop and then break out of it.. seems that your code generates every possible combination and then looks for the good one, which is a waste of time...
I found the solution to this: &amp;#x200B; [https://superuser.com/questions/1443958/miniconda-not-installing-sqlite-latest-version-within-python/1444076#1444076](https://superuser.com/questions/1443958/miniconda-not-installing-sqlite-latest-version-within-python/1444076#1444076)
Or use venv, since it's built-in
It's a terrible practice. You have no idea what you are overwriting. So, to give a silly example, if numpy has it's own function "print", you've just overwritten the standard print function without even knowing it. It destroys the concept of namespace. Anyone putting that in a tutorial has no business trying to teach people to use python. Better ways to import include: `import numpy` \- then you type numpy.&lt;function&gt; to access methods etc. This keeps your namespaces separate. `import numpy as np` \- this is actually the conventional standard for numpy. It's the same as above only you can avoid typing out numpy if typing 3 extra letters `from numpy import &lt;function&gt;` \- often you only want one or two parts of a package. This saves you from importing a gazillion functions from numpy if you only want to use a tiny part of the package

Im not familiar with the modules u are using but judging by the error you are using the function ImageGrab.grab() incorrectly. I would reccomend looking up the documentation about this particular module and see what arguments the function takes because the error is saying ur not passing enough arguments to it.
I loved the video, great job!
While these types of questions are neat, I want to point out to new learners: most of this stuff is the type of trivia where you don't need to remember it. Just look it up when you need to know it. Of course, it's hard to know when you need to know it, but that comes with experience. You should read this type of stuff so that you can build a model of how python works. Once you have that mental model then you don't have to remember all the details, you just know to look it up when you need it.
Cause I already use Py3 it doesn't really matter for me
Pretty cool!
You should use `trio` instead of "raw" python `asyncio`.
I’m working on getting started. I’m about an hour into the Python turtorial for Beginners on Programming with Mosh YouTube. Currently I’m trying to problem solve and take a lot of notes but I feel like I’m not getting it yet. But I’m not very far in so I’m not too worried.
Does that neural network uses the same idea of linear regression? In estimating the coefficients trying to minimaze the sum of the squared errors and etc
 import requests as r import gzip import csv url = "link to ur zipped up files" result = r.get(url, allow_redirects=True) open("filename.gz", "wb").write(result) f = gzip.GzipFile("/pathtofile.gz", "rb") res = f.read() f.close() f = open("name_of_csv.csv", "wb") f.write(res) f.close() with open('name_of_csv.csv', mode='r') as infile: reader = csv.reader(infile) with open('coors_new.csv', mode='w') as outfile: writer = csv.writer(outfile) mydict = {rows[0]:rows[1] for rows in reader} print(mydict) something like that should work, ur unzipping the gz file and writing its contents to a .csv then opening the csv file and looping through it adding each element into a dictionary then printing it while creating a new csv
So here's one lesson I learned in 30 years of programming: you do not write your own date &amp; time code, unless you are deeply masochistic. It's just too deep a rabbit hole to venture into. But if you insist, just calculating the number of calendar months between two given dates, ignoring time of day, timezones, and all the other conplexity, can be had way easier: 1. Split dates into year, month and day parts 2. Throw away the day parts 3. Convert the year + month pairs into "sequential months": something like year * 12 + month - 1 4. Find the difference between those two
Feels a bit like an overkill for my situation but I will take a look, thanks!
look up gradient descent
yeah zillow has a api, it looks fairly simple to interact with, could prob juse use the requests module in python to interact with zillows api.
I guess I could go into the itertools functions and take some of the code from there.

I think that assumes that the requirements of the dependencies are accurate and not overly strict, so you can find a solution. All too often, requirements aren’t tested on versions other than what the developer typically uses. Furthermore, no effort is put into making packages work on a wide range of versions. Matplotlib has a very reasonable strategy. Support as large a range of numpy as possible and for other packages, 3.5 years.
You don't need to do that... as you generate each possible password, test it right then to see if it's the right one and if so, break out. You don't need itertools for that.
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar
This is great as a learning exercise, but just as a heads-up to novices who might be tempted: In 2019 nobody should be attempting to write their own backprop code for multi-layer neural nets for actual applications. Once you understand the basic math behind gradient descent (e.g., the chain rule of calculus), you should really invest your time in learning how to work with one of the existing mature libraries like Keras, Tensorflow, PyTorch, etc. There are just far too many subtleties of numerical computing, complex bookkeeping in gradient calculations, and arcane tricks necessary to to write efficient code that it's a colossal waste of time trying to re-invent the wheel.
An addendum: if you implement this idea and continue to use itertools, I would strongly suggest against using list(&lt;a potentially huge product object&gt;). This forces Python to actually compute all the values and store them somewhere, as opposed to creating something which gives you the next value as you ask for it, eg by a for loop. So the improvement you might think that you're getting from the smarter logic will disappear due to this one word (list).

PyCharm FTW
Hmm, I see, but can't I just use Dropbox or something?
You could use dropbox. The only issue is, if you want to limit people's access when someone else is using a file. I don't think dropbox offers that kind of functionality. You might be able to have a public and private folder, where only you have access to the private folder. And when someone is using a file, you remove it from the public folder but keep it in the private folder. When they finish and upload the file, you copy the new update version to both the public and private folders. You'd have to work with the dropbox sdk in order to do that. https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-sdk-python

Just recently learned how to use NLTK &amp; beautiful soup to create a web identifier! :) always excited to see the results after learning.
here.com has an api that does this. I think the give you around 100k free lookups per month, which should be more than enough for you. https://developer.here.com/api-explorer/rest/geocoder/reverse-geocode They may have a rate limit though. You can just code that in to your script. Build a brief time.sleep in between requests. Or if you are doing requests in parallel, use a relatively small number of workers to make the requests ( like 3 or 4)

You probably only pass in the x size and y size but the function expects left x corner, left y corner, right x corner and right y corner if I’m right
dropbox has a python library for using the API
Look at the for loop as well. The a = a + 1 I suspect will add nothing, as the variable is overwritten in the next iteration. The value of a will be whatever the range object spits out, and is not affected by the previous value.
well it won't, but at any given time the two-body-system between earth and sun look as if they did. every orbit (including parabolas and hyperbolas) of one body around another has a specific energy (kinetic + potential) so the orbit only changes if this energy changes. for two body systems there is no condition in which one body just spirals into the other or away from it, for this a continuous substraction/addition of energy by a third body is required.
Herein is where my problem lies. I produced a bit of a different testing code: def product(\*args, Answer, repeat=1): i = 0 pools = \[tuple(pool) for pool in args\] \* repeat result = \[\[\]\] for pool in pools: for x in result: for y in pool: StrX = '' for f in range(len(x)): StrX = StrX + x\[f\] Code = StrX+y print(StrX+y) i = i + 1 if Code == Answer : print("It took the Machine", i, "tries to guess your password") print("Your password was", Code) break result = \[x+\[y\] for x in result for y in pool\] product(('ABCD'), Answer='CBDADACDAC', repeat=10) &amp;#x200B; It runs a bit better but I need to figure out how to get "result" out. This is a problem because it builds all the future combos off of the past result combos. It already replaces fully with new ones, but on scales really large (about 95\^length of passcode), it exceeds a memory error where the passcode length is greater than 3. It's trying to generate over 80 million new possibilities off of a previous 850,000 possibilities, yet I can't figure out a way around that issue.
 for attempt in itertools.product (&lt;characters&gt;, repeat=&lt;length of answer&gt;): if attempt == &lt;the right value in the right formay&gt;: print("yay") break ? Some parts left, obviously. Note that we never stick all the values in some list at any point. (It's still awfully slow, though)
Yes but the itertools product command itself stores previous passes in the list (which is what I based my code on) \`\`\` def product(\*args, repeat=1): *# product('ABCD', 'xy') --&gt; Ax Ay Bx By Cx Cy Dx Dy* *# product(range(2), repeat=3) --&gt; 000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111* pools = \[tuple(pool) for pool in args\] \* repeat result = \[\[\]\] for pool in pools: result = \[x+\[y\] for x in result for y in pool\] for prod in result: yield tuple(prod) \`\`\` The result in the code adds a list storing all previous attempts
How about open sourcing it anyways instead of requiring fake internet points? 😁
Haha yeah I'm about to do that
Note that there is a difference between using itertools and using the code in the documentation which is "roughly equivalent" to the behaviour. There are some optimisations that we miss if we do that.
ok, thanks. seems to be working so far. Just taking a long time as I'm trying to guess something out of a trillion possibilities...

The first point about neural networks is that they're not neural, and that they're not networks but graphs of mathematical calculations on vectors and tensors. Basically you use parametrized building blocks like linear transformations followed by a nonlinearity, and using numerical optimization your DL framework will find parameters that work well on your training set. The difference to "shallow" machine learning methods is that you're doing this without any formal guarantees, so there's more babysitting and black magic involved than in classical SVM learning. Ok, let's go for the 10 year old version. You want to build an algorithm for doing a thing (usually some images or text go in on one side and a classification comes out on the other side), and you're not sure how, so you build a very handwavy version that pretends it has some magic numbers at hand that will make the right things happen. And then you call a horde of numerical optimization gnomes that will do their best to fill in the best magical numbers they can find for your training set. And in the best of worlds, your handwavy version of the algorithm is then turned into a mostly-working version of the algorithm. Except when you don't have enough training data or the handwavy idea of the algorithm isn't quite right, then the gnomes will try to do their magic but nothing good comes of it.
&gt; Just look it up when you need to know it. Which, for some of these questions, might be never. ` How many bytecode instructions are used to execute this code? myfunc(a, b)` is fun to know but might not ever be necessary to know. (I think it's `LOAD_CONST` twice and then the call, so 3...)
Hey, I don’t know if you’ll see this, but if you want to, maybe we could make something together? My discord is Proprr#6955
Yes. Sorry to say that a brute force solution enumerating every possible answer (regardless of how likely it is) will be. If you have any more structure that you could use, it's probably helpful.
Oh, by the way, if you only want to know how many guesses your particular algorithm would have to make for a particular password, that's of course something you could do in O(1) space and time. (Consider for instance how many guesses separate AAA from ABA, and do the math.) But I don't know if that is the entirety of the task.
Python is great for scripting and "write once and forget about it" code. I would not use it as a web back-end because it doesn't really offer any features that are significant enough to compared to other frameworks like .net core or node js. &amp;#x200B; If I were to start over, I'd focus on node.js simply because I could use the same language on the front end as well as the back end. It's relatively new and is already of equal value of Python. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; But .NET Core is just so darn effective, especially when it comes to async-parralel programming that most other languages can't even touch so I'm sticking with that for now. &amp;#x200B; I'd say Python is miles ahead of PowerShell at least. &amp;#x200B; But like PowerShell, I wouldn't expect someone to take it seriously enough to make a web backend with it.

Depending on your python version there's a few ways. The issue you have is you can't add a string to an integer so convert the integer to a string like this. \`\`\` print("Your attack power is " + str(Power\\\*Strenth)) \`\`\` A better way is to use something like format \`\`\` print("Your attack power is \{\}".format(Power\\\*Strenth)) \`\`\`
you are trying to add integer to string "text" + power\*strength + "text" is pretty much string + integer + string, but there is no definition how to do string + int, so what you can do is to convert the integer to string using str() Here is how: print("Your attack power is " + Power*Strenth + " ") Or you can separate them into multiple arguments, which print() allows and it also is preffered way: print("Your attack power is", Power*Strenth) This one places space between provided arguments, so you not have to do it by yourself. You could also try some advanced formatting, see here: [PyFormat: Using % and .format() for great good!](https://pyformat.info/) but thats a bity more advanced then you need right now
Does [`Stats.add`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#pstats.Stats.add) accomplish this task?
With Python 3.6+ you can also use f strings to make code easier to read. print(f"Yout attack power is { Power*Strength}. ") In case you ever use more then one variable in the same string.
I know this is a joke but it's surprising close to: 'from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor MLPRegressors.fit(X_train, y_train).predict(X_test)' Lol

Hi, my forte is scraping. May I ask if you have already target websites where data will come from?
All that, and you iterate over a *list* of characters?
Pretty much basically. You do linear regression but wrap the equation of a straight line in another equation called a logistic function, which limits the output to between 0 and 1. This is now called logistic regression, like linear regression but good for predicting things that are either 0 or 1 (like classes, ie. a classifier). A simple neural net is just layers of logistic regressions where the outputs feed into the next layer. If you think of linear regression as a function fitting a line to data, then this highly dimensional and non-linear function fits a higher dimensional manifold to data.
Good job. Im at the moment aren't learning python but I really like your explanations. Subscribed.
Nice
What's wrong about that?
`for char in '╚█╗═╝╔║':`
Indeed :D I extracted the ASCII art characters via copy&amp;paste from a set in the repl and couldn't be bothered to give it another thought.
I did my capstone project in Python. Built a VM that ran on assembly. Then built a compiler to compile to assembly. You should do that.

What do you mean by tabs?
For example, when you open spyder, by clicking on adding a new file it opens a new tab. Ill post a picture now.
Python can generate CSV files. You can use Google to find out how, it's very simple.
Python is pretty good with API and automation stuff. Maybe you could use it to analyze and visualize data from an O-Scope. Maybe you can automate test devices to be controlled through it. It's a real versatile language, if you have something like a Raspberry Pi you can use it to toggle GPIO pins on and off, connecting to some other circuit to do whatever. The possibilities are endless!
but my question is more orientated as to how I can use an already existing csv and transport it into another tab in python.
Thanks a lot! I’ll have a look into that
Ok, Spyder is an IDE. Python doesn't have tabs. Python and Spyder are separate things. Spyder has tools in the other tabs that let you view the state of your program which would allow you to view the contents of your variables. You could probably load the CSV then print the output of your program then run it in the Spyder console and everything printed would show up in the console tab. I feel like you're trying to accomplish something but don't quite have the right tools.
You are completely right! I am sorry! I meant spyder, Im still quite new to this. Thanks a lot. The problem is that I have to have it all in the same code, so I cant use 2 different tabs.
I believe the equation for the number of possibilities is the amount of characters that can be used (case sensitive) to the power of the length of the passcode.
This is not I was looking for, I need the start date and the end date as given, and no. of months falling between the two, the whole exercise is required to calculate month-wise business days(weekdays) between the two dates - &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; The final step will be to use, pd.bdate\_range on Month\_StartDate and Month\_EndDate, to get monthwise business date.
this won\`t solve the problem, monthwise startdate and end date, where the first month start date and last month end date should be same as given date range
this will give me only no. of the month falling between two date ranges. there is a detailed explanation in the question which is about creating a list of months start date and month en date between a date range.
&gt;check out anaconda. It has a program called navigator where you can easily see your environments in a dashboard. you can create or delete an environment with one click. Same with packages. &gt; &gt;You can search and install a package through navigator &gt; &gt;you can type 'conda install package' in cmd/terminal &gt; &gt;you can activate the virtual environment and type 'python -m pip install package' &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Hope this helps. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;.
 data['month diff'] = data['End Begin'].dt.month -data['Start Begin'].dt.month
print("Your attack power is", Power\*Strenth) &amp;#x200B; That works well and is simple. I wonder how I didn't stumble on that. It looks like something I did try. Oh well. Thanks.
This kind of post is better suited for /r/learnpython. You'll need to also explain what you expect to happen and what is actually happening with your code when you run it.
Thanks for the reply! Will post it there next time and i have edited the post with my expectations.

At my prior job we automated a lot of the tests with python. Need to take 500 or more data points, gotta automate it.
The idea of estimating a value and minimising loss is there. First the inputs (normalised) are feeded into the NN. And all the calculations are done.Every Neurons have weights and biases feeding into it. Neurons aggregate them and applies some activation function (Sigmoid, tanh,ReLU,leaky ReLU..) and some loss function (Cross entropy, MSE, Logloss etc). This is called forward pass. Then backpropagation is done and the weights are updated a small step towards minimum loss. Gradient decent uses algorithms like NAG,Adam and has variants like stochastic,batch and mini batch Gradient Decent. Forward pass and backpropagation is repeated for some epochs. Thus the loss is minimised and learning is done.
99% of machine learning is the stuff between those lines, and prepping X_train to not be garbage
Probably figures out the type based on the response time type from the server. So if it responds with a json mine type that is your answer.
/r/learnpython
Have a look at pygeocoder
great, this will give the no of working days in a date range but if you want no of working days in a date range by month, it might not work because first we need to find the months falling between those date range.
r/learnpython is indeed a better spot for beginner question, but the answer is pretty brief. In programming, functions are bits of code that you want to run elsewhere and/or repeatedly. It helps when you want to make things simpler, and not repeat yourself. Like mathematical functions, some may take some arguments and return a value. So, to define a function, we use the def keyword, like so: `def square(x):` `return x * x` which says to define a function called square, that takes one argument called x, and return the value of x\*x. If we don't use return, then it returns None, a "this is nothing" value. We can then use square to square things in our program (or other functions) I recommend r/learnpython, the Python doc pages, and a good python tutorial.
Thank you for leading me in the right direction and teaching me what def meant, I haven’t been on r/learnpython but I will now!
good luck!
I wrote an AccuWeather Forecast in Python recently ( [https://www.codeastar.com/easy-accuweather-forecast-in-python/](https://www.codeastar.com/easy-accuweather-forecast-in-python/) ). It is nothing new and fancy, just find that many people are looking for similar program. So I shared mine to all :\]\]
This is definitely not the place to ask for help with bugs in applications that just happen to be written in Python. Contact the developers.
HTTP as a protocol doesn't say anything about what the response body should be - it can be JSON, HTML, binary data, plain text, anything the server wants it to be. So, when you request a page from a website, you get HTML, because that's what the website serves to you. If you make a request to an API endpoint, you'll probably get back some machine readable data, like JSON or XML.

It is enough. PySide2 is the Qt5 binding I would use though (license,cheaper if commercial).

Of course, I have made for my graduation work an application simulating ECG signal for specific diseases.
PyQt/PySide are more than up to the job. Qt is a first-rate GUI toolkit. There aren’t a lot of Python docs because it’s assumed you’ll use the (excellent) native Qt docs. They’re not for Python, but it’s fairly easy to work out the Python equivalents.
is it built by PyQt5?
Yep! Good luck. It’s a lot more confusing than flask. At least I thought it was. I’m still no where near even being intermediate but I like it better than flask now. It has a lot of cool features built in.

There is no Myth, just a couple misunderstandings. Multithreading does in fact suck in Python, and the root cause isn't really the GIL, it's the language itself. Specifically, these design choices: - Dynamic typing and other dynamic features - Unrestricted mutability (imperative paradigm) - Automatic memory management The combination of these three makes multithreading difficult on both sides. For an interpreter / compiler implementer, it means you need to somehow make the interpreter state and garbage collector thread-safe, but due to the fact that everything is potentially shared, you cannot optimize this much; for a user code programmer, it means that you can't tell the compiler what you do and do not want to mutate, or what you do and do not want to share between threads, nor can you automate the process of reasoning about your program's threading semantics in any way. The GIL is a brute-force method of keeping interpreter state consistent between threads, simply by not allowing any two threads to concurrently manipulate it, and by forcing each thread to finish its transaction against the interpreter before the next one gets its turn - and it effectively renders the interpreter single-threaded, much like in JavaScript or Golang (though with different sugar on top, so the code looks different, with explicit thread spawning and joining instead of callback-style CPS or "goroutines"). Other solutions exist, but they all have downsides of their own.
I've made two professional complicated GUI's using Pyqt5. It has endless features and is used by many big companies. You can do anything with it.
Why not go the Shiny route?
This is cool and all, but it feel it's a little disingenuous to call this a neural network tutorial that teaches backpropigation. Really you are demonstrating the delta rule, which is more like the first little step towards deriving the backpropigation algorithm because it is teaching a spacial case that works for single layer networks only. In fact, you aren't even using the normal delta rule (you didn't include a learning rate (eta)). I encourage you to continue to make videos and study machine learning though!

I believe the binary tree iteration questions are referring to `yield` and `yield from`
Are you a mechanic or know about cars? If you don't, best to brush up on your mechanic knowledge to see what your application would be suggesting to its users and how feasible everything is. You'll probably want to follow the path of asking the user a few questions and giving them options letting them narrow down what could be the problem. I'm not too sure it'll be possible, at least without an intelligent system like a neural network, to come up with a decent recommendation system. You're looking at an algorithmic recommendation system.
Thanks, trio a blessing and turns out, it isn’t an overkill, rather, it’s a savior.
You’ll find a lot more resources for **Qt**, which is the toolkit powering PyQt5. The Qt company has added official Python support as well with [Qt for Python (Pyside2)](https://www.qt.io/qt-for-python). I would recommend switching to that, which will be quite straightforward because the interface is nearly identical (same underlying C++ toolkit). Qt is extremely powerful and capable, but the bulk of the resources available will be for the C++ bindings as these are more commonly used. The class names and methods are nearly identical so if you are willing to dip into reading some C++ code you will find far more materials.
Sound like a BSC project for Hertfordshire.
Apart for some minor technical issues such as black screen transitions, and sometimes hard to understand accent (you are good in english but it's always good to practive pronunciation of hard work. I myself am not native english speaker so you can take my word for it. People will like you more if you speak in a way easier for them to understand). Good video. My suggestion would be to separate it to 2 distinct videos: general and in depth. In general you would have premade code so nobody has to sit through you just typing code, and you explain only the main gist of how it works. And in depth where you explain every line of code. &amp;#x200B; Great video tho. subscribed. Cheers

Sorry but you're basically asking someone to do it for you. Go out and look for program that do simple things. Research is the only way you're gonna figure it out. Getting help isn't gonna help you with your write up either.
MoviePY is painfully slow because the library is implemented purely in Python, even though video processing is usually extremely resource-heavy. Lower-level languages are more suitable for the under-the-hood implementation of such intensive tasks. I'd personally recommend using VapourSynth instead, a Python video processing framework similar to MoviePy, except that it's much, much faster because the core operations are written in C++.
Yes I have been researching. Unfortunately there aren't many programs that are similar to that one. I'll keep looking though. Thanks for your time.
This doesn’t need the network at all. It is just using the system clock. [this the function that eventually gets called when you call time.time()](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/8709490f48fc27b3dd1a16acb33bea2299c6a575/Python/pytime.c#L653) I mean if just getting the time required hitting the network python would be useless.
Have you ever used a KDE-based Linux desktop? The whole KDE project is based on QT so it's clearly up to the job.

Yes. If your algorithm stops without generating unnecessary guesses, you can for almost all sets of correct passwords (ie those not that aren't 100% the worst-case) improve the average number of attempts on that quite a lot. Beside memory considerations, that is. But you are correct that the worst case for brute forcing - if you need to guess the entire password at the same time, and don't have any structure or knowledge such as it being a dictionary word - would be that what you just said.
I downvoted this video on Youtube. Here's why: \- Lots of handwaving throughout the video. \- Calling something "Basic" or "Easy" in a tutorial is ill advised. \- Uninteresting problem statement. You missed an opportunity to connect with people by using a real world usage of NN. \- I'm not even sure this video is about teaching, more than showing off that you know a thing or two about NN.
Sorry for the stupid question, but have you actually installed TinyDB? My PyCharm installation didn't find it as it's not part of the standard library but let me install it and it works fine. You can install it from the command line: "pip install tinydb" or from pycharm either by moving to the line "from tinydb..." and pressing Alt+Enter or going to File &gt; Settings &gt; Project &gt; Project Interpreter and pressing the "+" button.
Assuming someone’s intelligence is bold
I’m gonna comment so I can find this later when I have more time
If you're already familiar with Qt, why not stick with it? The [latest bindings (pyside2)](https://www.qt.io/qt-for-python) are really good, and if you want to really do crossplatform (desktop and mobile) it translates into C++ very easily.

Hi thx for your message. You mean together in this project, or smth new? For this project I can make some good entry issues. Give me know If you are intersted in :)
Install tinydb module. It does not come with the standard library. If you create your PyCharm project with virtual environment and create a `requirements.txt` file in the root project directory, you won't be needing to install things manually. Just add module names to that file (one per line) and PyCharm will give you an option to install what is missing. It uses `pip` for that.
I did so, I also thought about it so i wrote help(’modules’) and TinyDB was on the list so i am guessing its correctly installed
Odd, did you use a virtual environment or system interpreter?
I've seen (and used) Lutz' tome "Learning Python". It's great, in the sense that it teaches you the language, and explains some design choices and "gotchas". https://www.learning-python.com/about-lp5e.html I'd also get Ramalho's "Fluent Python" (recommended below), but definitely wouldn't start out with it.
Where exactly is the root project directory? The whole project folder or somewhere in there?
Virtual environment i suppose
Root project directory is the one you supply to PyCharm during project creation. It's usually where your main source file is located, but project structures differ depending on the needs and personal preferences. Create the `requirements.txt` file in the root of your project file tree on the left panel and you should be good.
Love your work. Going to look into the code later this week. Very inspiring!

Well it worked and also shows me the DETAILS about it as it isnt coming out blank so it is properly installed but still doesnt work
&gt; Multithreading does in fact suck in Python, and the root cause isn't really the GIL, it's the language itself. I disagree. Python as a language is perfectly capable of multi-threading without a GIL. We have a GIL because the CPython (and PyPy) GC heavily relies on reference counting, which is hard to do efficiently without a GIL. Some other internal optimizations of CPython also build on the fact that there is a GIL (e.g. object pooling) but the point is: All of this is implementation specific. A different implementation may choose do not have a GIL and solve these problems differently, without changes to Python as a language. * Dynamic typing has no impact on multi-threading or GC complexity. If at all, it makes things easier for the interpreter/GC. * Mutability is also not a real issue. In any language, there is mutable state and the interpreter and GC have to deal with it. There is no big difference if some or all state is mutable, from the interpreter/GC point of view. * Automatic memory management (aka GC) is infact a hard problem to solve, but not a show-stopper. Lots of languages have a parallel GC without a GIL. Read/write gates are a common method to prevent or shorten the stop-the-world phase of a parallel GC. Instead of preventing any reads/writes, the GC is notified about them and can handle them gracefully. See Jython/IronPython or any other language that runs on JVM or CLR.
That’s nice! Can you upload the code somewhere?
the code : https://github.com/anishsatalkar/python_gravity_simulation_pygame
 import requests import gzip url = "http://mysite.com/myfile.csv.gz" filename = url.split("/")[-1] with open(filename, "wb") as f: r = requests.get(url) f.write(r.content) with gzip.open(filename, "rb") as f, open(filename[:-3], "wb") as fout data = f.read() fout.write(data) It will download file from `url`, save it and ungzipped file. Then you can process your csv file as you like. Saying 'csv data in a dictionary' is too generic, idk what you want from it.
As far as C extension modules are concerned, the GIL is a necessary, even essential, evil. Extension modules depend on the GIL to protect their data, and any removal of the GIL would require pushing down object-level locking to extension modules. There are design choices in the C API as well that make the GIL difficult to remove.
I wrote a script that sets windows environment variables for me and erases them when I am done.
You should try out NumPy. If you vectorize the calculations correct, 10,000 particles will be no issue.
As I see you don't actually need to do something with tabs. What you need is add reading/writing CSV files in any script you want to use that data in. Each script then can read csv file into variable, process, then write back to csv (same file or another). https://realpython.com/python-csv/
You could try to split the space into boxes, only having to apply the force with particles in the same box or a nearby box (gravity is weak from afar because it's inversely proportional to the distance).
The problem with gravity is it’s got a pretty slow 1/r^2 fall-off, so it’s tricky to say the effect on a particle is just due to some subset of nearest neighbours. That leads of O(N^2) scaling as the simulated size increases, and you end up with fried computers.
You should ask on /r/learnpython...but the short answer is add the path to git.exe to your PATH environment variable.
You don't need to compute sqrt You don't need to compute arctan, sin or cos. You shouldn't have a nested loop of 2 full sets. Do that and you could compute maybe 2000 objects. But the key is to do a whole other algorithm is you want it to scale properly.
All points considered, what language would you recommend for a good threading implementation?

Can it be added temporarily? Cause I need to set a portable environment.
I've made a few large desktop applications using PyQt5, the largest being a data analysis program for my research group : [iris](https://github.com/LaurentRDC/iris-ued). The docs (C++) are stellar. You have to mentally translate to Python, but it's not hard. Otherwise, you can learn by reading other source code. That's how I learned.
The PySide2 documentation is also great, most (but not all) of the docs are now actually in Python.
What are your computer specs? I have access to HPCs
I know this differs from the other opinions here, but I *don't* think python is a good choice for building desktop apps, because of the performance and type safety. It would be better to choose a statically-compiled language like C++, Vala, Crystal, I think there's something in Nim, pretty sure Go has an option... There are plenty of choices that aren't writing a whole desktop application in a scripting language.
In future, Kivy will not have support of python2 ? That is so sad.
I recommend you check out our article about - [What is Python used for?](https://stxnext.com/what-is-python-used-for/)
I will, thanks.
shiny is a web-based app which ask users to upload their data, however, most of medical data are sensitive to upload or share.
How do you not loop through both sets when each object influences all the other objects?
Create a batch file with: set PATH=%PATH%;q:\portablegit\git\cmd\ Adjust path to the correct directory and add additional paths as needed.
Yeah defo use numpy and that should speed things up. Also use a matrix, and then solve the matrix equation.
I agree. I've built my fair share of large Python desktop applications, and I would not choose it to do it again. Static types provide a safety net when modifying a part of the application. At the same time, Python's ecosystem is so rich that getting started making specialized applications is a breeze.
Tried with PyPy? It'll often run un-altered code like this significatly faster. Though, other people mention improvements like skipping the sqrt too
wonderful bro ,wonderful like JCBkikhudayi :-p
The [Runge-Kutta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge–Kutta_methods) algorithm is great for this, although I don’t feel qualified enough to explain how it works. I did an exercise sheet on it in a lecture about Computational Physics.
Subinterpreters are an exciting alternative to multiprocessing https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0554/
Could you share as a reference :)?
You can use NumPy broadcasting rules to efficiently calculate an outer product, which will do the trick.
Using RK4 still requires nested loops to calculate the forces on each particle.
Runge-Kutta is actually pretty bad for gravity simulations because it's not symplectic (won't conserve energy) and its pretty expensive (requires four n^2 force evaluations per timestep). But the integrator isn't the bottleneck here, the force calculation is. Using a tree code to group distant particles as an approximation would greatly reduce the runtime of the simulation.
Still needs more dark matter. That said, I love your work, keep it up.
Say you have 3 objects. Since every action has an equal and opposite reaction, you just have to find the object pairs that act upon each other. Thus it's this: A, B A, C B, C 3 pairs. Not 9 (or 6 if you count filtering as eliminating 3 of them). `C(n, 2)` vs `A(n, 2)` (or even `n**2`).
I'd just go to github and sort by python and popular - being exposed to all different types of projects is probably better than looking at specifically well made or regarded ones.
&gt;ivy will not have support of python2 ? That is so s Well, python 2 will not be supported in the near future anyway. [https://pythonclock.org/](https://pythonclock.org/)
Ну что же я могу сделать?
Unfortunately this would eliminate long orbits completely, and they're fun and realistic.
using `@numba.jit` makes it as fast, if not faster, than PyPy. Though severely limiting functionality, which is fine, if you only do it in the critical code path. Check out my example: https://github.com/apisarenco/naive-n-body-sim Create a virtualenv, activate it and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and then run the code.
Your code is an absolute pleasure to read.
I think that the best way to learn a language is by writing code in it. So just think of a fun project and start working on it. On the way you can read about good practices and try to follow them in your project. Also ask people that already know that language for advice. In conclusion, stop looking for a project to read, and write one yourself. It won't be perfect, but it will me more useful.
For really enormous simulations the best known approach is the [fast multipole method](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_multipole_method), but it requires a bit more mathematical sophistication.
**Fast multipole method** The fast multipole method (FMM) is a numerical technique that was developed to speed up the calculation of long-ranged forces in the n-body problem. It does this by expanding the system Green's function using a multipole expansion, which allows one to group sources that lie close together and treat them as if they are a single source.The FMM has also been applied in accelerating the iterative solver in the method of moments (MOM) as applied to computational electromagnetics problems. The FMM was first introduced in this manner by Greengard and Rokhlin and is based on the multipole expansion of the vector Helmholtz equation. By treating the interactions between far-away basis functions using the FMM, the corresponding matrix elements do not need to be explicitly stored, resulting in a significant reduction in required memory. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Some SQL code has become too complex to be maintainable. In pure declarative SQL, rows get aggregated and then joined back to the original data set, and the aggregated values are re-distributed per row according to some freaky rules that have now become dependent on the source of the row of the data, and it might need additional lookups in separate tables. I'm moving it to Python. It will take 2 times longer to execute, but it will allow this functionality extension, debugging, and better code management, and more readable, which is more important. I might also gain back performance from the fact that no more aggregation step is necessary - I could just keep reading row after row in the proper order, and once the final row in the group is fetched, the batch gets processed. The challenge is to lose as little performance as possible, and dealing with a different understanding of what `NULL` vs `None` means in both systems. For example `x + NULL = NULL`, and `x + None` throws error, and many more such examples. Boring, but necessary.

Indeed, it's the next thing I want to tackle in my blog.
n*(n-1)/2 interactions still scales as O(n²).
*Vectorization*
Vectorize your code
You only need to loop once. Rather than calculating N^2 forces, you need N^2/2. Also, you’re computing your mass products excessively since it’s not changing most of the time.
Yes, but it’s about 10,000x more accurate allowing for larger time steps and more realistic orbits. The math really isn’t that hard.
Yeah, this was another point I wanted to raise, but it was gonna take some time to write out: The force is also proportional to mass, so we can't only check the nearby boxes. But we can still get something good. We give each box a list of the particles inside it, sorted from highest to lowest mass. Each iteration, for every particle we check every box, starting from the highest mass particle in the current box. We calculate the force of gravity for every particle, and stop calculating once the force is too low. Once you're done, start moving the particles. If a particle passes from one box to another, you insert it in the correct position in the list. This updating would be tricky, since you're iterating over the things you're updating, so you have to keep track somehow of the particles you already moved.
In computational cosmology they use what is called N-body codes to do this sort of thing to see how structure in the universe, such as clusters and galaxies, are formed. I think you would find reading about that interesting :)
Ok, off topic but after wasting my teen years on little web games like this, I never understood how things get into perfect orbits. Everything just seems to tend into spirals either in or out. How do things like the moon not spiral in or out?
Yes, it’s also twice as fast and it also might allow you to see ma * mb is being computed as N^2 instead of N times. You also might see there is sqrt(R^2), which is just abs(R). You still have your N^2/2 but every little bit helps, so maybe it gets down to N^2/40 after all that. I’ll take a 40x speedup... I learned to use numpy frombuffer instead of using structs to read binary files. I then did things like saving struct objects. I didn’t improve the order at all, but sped it up from 45 minutes to 4 seconds. That factor is incredibly important. No it’s not the first thing you should worry about, but if you know something is inefficient, you should consider fixing it. Rather than fixing the worst part first, you should fix the easy part first and build up your skills.
??? Why use an actual project? Just make a quick hello-world style package.
It’s a lot faster, but it’s tricky. We had a hard time adding it to our aero solver, which implements Helmholtzs equations. The only difference is it uses aerodynamic letters instead of electrical ones and supersonic flow requires a transformation.
1. /r/learnpython 2. Look into the `in` operator.
I agree this would be the right way to do it. Unfortunately I'm not familiar with packaging a python package with a C extension. It would take me a day or two to do it, and I'd like to spend the time doing more useful tasks that shaving some seconds off my test suite. Maybe you can point me to a cookiecutter-like project I could use. That would be very helpful.
What is this letter salad at the end of your comment?
If you're going for accuracy you might as well use symplectic integrators...
I prefer [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) myself, which is a subset of the functionality that [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) gives you. One other to look into is [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv), although I am not a fan.
I work at a semiconductor manufacturer that focuses on radio frequency applications. I personally work for a layout team helping them automate their processes. So I may not have the information you're after. If you're doing something similar to what my company does: Python is great for automating tedious tasks. E.g. after you run your verifications/simulations it's really nice to use a small script to aggregate all of the output and summarize it for you. If you're lucky enough to use tools that are semi-modern they may have a nice python API you can plug into. Unfortunately for me we're a Cadence place so I get to use SKILL :') The lab here has some C++ code that helps them manage all of their test benches. A lot of this was written a long time ago and something like Python is likely a better choice now. You can also make some nice charts/graphs to show off in a Power Point using things like matplotlib(or better yet some nice wrapper libraries for it).
To answer your question #1, No. A Python Virtual Environment is basically a separator Python environment/directory which is being treated independently. Here are two examples. Example 1, let's say you have Python 3.0 installed on your PC, you need to build two different programs. Program 1 uses libraries X, Y, Z and Program 2 uses library A, B, C. In general, you can simply install library X, Y, Z, A, B, C on your default environment, but the downside is, sometimes when you have too many libraries installed, things can get messy when you finish building a program. For one, the program may only needs libraries X, Y, Z but you are include libraries A, B, C, which are not needed. And if you installed bunch libraries together, sometimes you may run into compatible issues. By creating individual virtual environment for each program you are building, you know you can just install the libraries that you need for those programs. &amp;#x200B; Example 2. Let's say you have 2 different versions of Python installed: Python 2.5 and Python 3.0. Python 2.5 and Python 3.0 have slight syntax difference. Sometimes you need to use Python 2.5 for your projects and sometimes you need Python 3.0 for other projects. Using virtual environment you can create instance of Python environment for the Python version you need to use. &amp;#x200B; Q2. I think Virtualenv will eventually phase out, but that will be a long long time until no one uses Python 3.4 or earlier version. The rest of tools should be around for at least awhile and should/shouldn't depending on what you are doing with Python. &amp;#x200B; Q3. I don't use PyEnv so I can't provide you with an answer. If you are using Python 3.5 or later, you can use Venv, which is the standard module to create a virtual environment (also recommended method). If you are using Python 3.4 or earlier version, then using VirtualEnv library is recommended. You will have to install VirtualEnv library separately. &amp;#x200B; Q4. You probably don't need docker for now until you become more experienced with development. &amp;#x200B; Lastly, Conda is a Python package manager. Kinda like when you buy a PS4 or XBOX One, you can choose to buy just the console itself or you can buy the bundle that comes with other games, accessories, except with a management control center. I personally don't recommend use Conda since they come with few side effect and I don't need all the libraries come with it.
It's a popular activity in India ,which has gone viral on YouTube with millions of views. Lol IRW, the video of JCB excavators excavating have recently gone viral with many views on YouTube so as a consequence netizens have start a sarcastic trend on Twitter which "JCBkikhudayi" Which means "excavation of JCB"

Yes, sure, you'll be suffering the same degree of penalty from increased number of objects, but the whole thing is just much faster. It's like running bubble sort on a 16MHz processor vs a modern core i7. It's the same shitty bubble sorry, but you can't deny that one is ridiculously faster than another.
Are we not doing requirements.txt anymore? Manually installing dependencies is so 2006.
I'm new to Python, so I'll look into that, thanks.
Huh, interesting and makes sense. Thanks! That's a great example of "is not correct but it's good enough", even though the base simulation is also "good enough".
&gt; I live in Chicago Thank god I don't have to live in that shithole of yours, with all the *vibrancy* it has.
I wasn’t sure on the term. There are issues with all integrators for orbits. At least an RK4 is a 4th order polynomial, which is better than assuming constant acceleration. A sympletctic integrator was used in a really fun black and whit Mac game called Gravitational LTD I used to play. Orbits would precess, which I though was real at the time. We’d let it run over night and trace out cool paths.
Every dictionary in Python has the methods keys() and values(). you can do: ``` 'xxx' in mydict.keys() # returns true if a key 'xxx' exists 'yyy' in mydict['xxx']['value'].values(). # returns true is a value 'yyy' exists ``` Both methods returns an iterable, for you can do a `for key in mydict.keys():` to loop over every key.
Try: https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-python It does require compilation but the amount of C code seems to be pretty small.
I typically use cufflinks with Plotly and would love to switch to this as an alternative. Any plans to support adding multiple X/Y axis by passing a list of DataFrame columns? Thanks!
Why is that?
Can you give me an example of what you'd like the API to look like for this? We're definitely working on it but still unsure of the best API :)
From my limited understanding from the Edx Python for Data Science course, numpy arrays are incredibly fast.
&gt; Python as a language is perfectly capable of multi-threading without a GIL. True, and I never claimed GIL was fundamentally necessary. Just that it's one of several possible solutions to the problem of making a Python interpreter thread-safe, and that other solutions have to make other sacrifices to achieve it.
Numpy does the underlying math in optimized machine code that'll use your CPUs vector units rather that forcing you to slowly loop over lists in poorly optimized Python.
Definitely check out Numba. If you combine it with numpy, you may get an incredible performance boost.
It might be possible to implement an algorithm similar to Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) summation. It's an algorithm used in molecular Dynamics simulation to calculate electrostatic interactions which are also long ranged. Basically you don't calculate them in real space but take the fourir transformation and sum them up in fourir space using FFTW. The that reduces the complexity to O(N*log(N)) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewald_summation
&gt; Unfortunately I'm not familiar with packaging a python package with a C extension. Then why are you writing tools for testing C extensions, and how will you ever know whether you've "done it correctly" &gt; Maybe you can point me to a cookiecutter-like project I could use. Sure that could save you some time for that specific cookiecutter-like project, but again, how can you know about properly testing a thing if you don't fundamentally know how that thing is supposed to work in the first place.
**Ewald summation** Ewald summation, named after Paul Peter Ewald, is a method for computing long-range interactions (e.g., electrostatic interactions) in periodic systems. It was first developed as the method for calculating electrostatic energies of ionic crystals, and is now commonly used for calculating long-range interactions in computational chemistry. Ewald summation is a special case of the Poisson summation formula, replacing the summation of interaction energies in real space with an equivalent summation in Fourier space. In this method, the long-range interaction is divided into two parts: a short-range contribution, and a long-range contribution which does not have a singularity. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Currently running your code with 1000 bodies and width and height both at 750, and i am getting 1 fps
Thanks! I'll try this.
Numpy Arrays are fast because the array reserves disk space contiguously , which results in faster processing time !
How would I get the X and Y components of force acting on a body without performing the atan, sin and cos calculations?
I understand your concern, and it reminds me of this recent HN thread about the XY problem: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20068686 I'll give some context, if you're curious about why I asked this. I'm working on a tool that creates a docker image with pre-installed python wheels. The idea is to install packages needed for the build in a container, do the build there, copy the wheels to a container that only has run dependencies (to save space in the final image) and commit the "skinny" container to an image. This way I can get an image with compiled wheels, but without the build dependencies. I believe I understand the building process well enough to get this done. But I don't master Python C extensions. I contributed a little code to one, but I'm no expert. I still think the tool I'm trying to build will have value for me. I also think having a test that actually compiles a package is nice.
Would you please explain for what exactly I could use numpy? Because the lists are at max 2 elements long. Secondly, I just read about the Barnes-Hut simulation algorithm, and I'd probably try implementing it asap!
Could you please explain how I'd be able to determine the euclidean distance between 2 objects without using sqrt?
This is cool! Side note, did you intend for the values for Height/Width to be swapped? (looks like you intended a standard screen rez of 1920x1200 but their backwards.)
Try reading the Qt C++ docs. It's very well written. However please look into the licensing if you are planning to use it for commercial work.
As far as I remember, the body needs to have a specific velocity to stay in orbit. Anything less than that and it would spiral towards the other body, and anything faster than that velocity, and it would slingshot out of the orbit.
Yeah I just read about the Barnes-Hut algorithm which reduces the time complexity to O(nlogn). Thanks!
No you can't. And this is a fucking ad
Try doing hundreds of thousands: https://github.com/inducer/pyopencl
well i did so but nothing really happens
Correct. Adding to that, and to debunk the myth that "NumPy arrays are fast". They are actually really slow, if use perform math on them directly from Python -- in a for-loop for example. Using the NumPy functions for add, sub, div, mul and so on to substitute for-loops, is really fast, because they leave the scope of Python (releasing the GIL), and perform the task in compiled binary code, which utilizes the CPU's vector units (SIMD).

Hey, thanks a lot for offering help to me! My specs are : 8GB RAM and an i5-8250U. As some people have suggested me to use numpy and the Barnes-Hut simulation algorithm, I'd be able to optimize the code to easily handle thousands of particles. I'll first try them out, and them come back to you if I still need those awesome HPCs. Again, thanks a lot for the help!
Either you are doing something wrong or your environment is faulty. Try recreating the project and make sure you have a working `pip`. If that won't help, install TinyDB module manually by running `pip install tinydb`. If you are using virtual environment, don't forget to activate it first.

Copy-paste from another comment I made: "Using the NumPy functions for add, sub, div, mul and so on to substitute for-loops, is really fast, because they leave the scope of Python (releasing the GIL), and perform the task in compiled binary code, which utilizes the CPU's vector units (SIMD)." If you use NumPy to "vectorize" your calculations, they might become 100x faster. This example is not really that clear, but if you have a look at this code, you'll see the difference. The performance difference is a few minutes vs. less then a second in the NumPy version. https://github.com/Baekalfen/Helmholtz-Coil-Simulator
Use Python 3? It was released over a decade ago.
Yeah I read about the N-body simulation optimizations and they are really interesting! Thanks a lot!
So, triangle ABC, where AB and AC are the sides and BC is the hypotenuse, and ABC is the angle x. sin(x) = AB/BC cos(x) = AC/BC So you want to compute x first, by dividing the 2 sides that you know and computing the arctan of the ratio. And then you want to find the forces on each direction by multiplying it to sin and cos of that angle. Seems redundant, isn't it? Sin and cos are the ratios between each side and the hypotenuse, that you've already computed in order to find the force.
Code Here: [https://github.com/mbecker20/G-sim-anim/blob/master/orbit\_simul\_anim.py](https://github.com/mbecker20/G-sim-anim/blob/master/orbit_simul_anim.py)
Exactly! Since the time complexity is O(n\^2), it isn't ideal for 1000 bodies using my simple implementation. As others have rightly pointed out, I'd have to optimize my code a lot to handle a thousand-body plus simulation!
Thanks a lot! :D

I'm sure it's still very unoptimized but I wanted to share it with you guys. Here's the source code: [https://github.com/guille0/songoku](https://github.com/guille0/songoku)
I just looked this up. It looks really impressive.
I would think you need to rebuild the virtualenv for each machine.
&gt; dependency injection container Why?
It's a link to an article. Pretty normal for Reddit. I would disagree. It's a skill. Get good at a particular language, learn to get things done quickly, focus on what's important, have plenty of code around to reuse, use the simplest solution that solves the problem, know what questions to ask before starting development, etc. I can tell you that a project that once took me three months to do I can now do in 2-3 days.
Let me explain the image above. &amp;#x200B; This is a python program which can draw all kinds of uniform Euclidean tilings, see the wiki page: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform\_tiling#Uniform\_tilings\_of\_the\_Euclidean\_plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_tiling#Uniform_tilings_of_the_Euclidean_plane) &amp;#x200B; And the code is hosted on github: [https://github.com/neozhaoliang/pywonderland/blob/master/src/hyperbolic-tilings/example\_Euclidean\_uniform\_tilings.py](https://github.com/neozhaoliang/pywonderland/blob/master/src/hyperbolic-tilings/example_Euclidean_uniform_tilings.py) &amp;#x200B; This program is inspired by fogleman's project here: [https://github.com/fogleman/Tiling](https://github.com/fogleman/Tiling) But they are quite different in nature. &amp;#x200B; What's special with this program? To explain this in a simple way: it used quite sophisticated math to generate all tiles (with no repeats), the algorithm involved here is called the "automaton of Coxeter groups". All uniform tilings of the spherical/Euclidean/hyperbolic spaces have certain kind of symmetry, and this symmetry can be characterized by a Coxeter group. The tiles in the tiling are in one-to-one correspondence with elements in the group. But Coxeter groups are automatic (a deep result found by Brink and Howlett at 90's), that is, its elements can be generated by a DFA (a rough explanation), so I just computed the DFA of the group, and used it to generate all words in this group, then transform the basic tile to get the whole tiling. &amp;#x200B; This approach also works for spherical and hyperbilc tilings, I'll upload the code for these two cases in the coming weeks.
The guy can be “special” but it’us undeniable that he’s done a lot for the ebook community over the years, and for free.
This is already a solved problem with multi-stage builds. https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/
Probably a silly layman question: is this simulating three dimensions? I see particles going through each other and not colliding.
Go isn't single-threaded, different goroutines can run on different threads in parallel. The language has always been supported this, but it wasn't the default until version 1.5 (released in 2015).
I wouldn’t touch Tauthon with a barge pole. Official CPython comes with well-defined governance model, support guarantees, oversight, upgrade paths, and so on. Tauthon is literally “a bunch of people on github”. If your business depends on something so critical that you can’t spend a few weeks porting it to 3.6+ and would rather rely on random patches from the internet, you are in trouble.
I tried it and putting one at the start and one at the back doesn't work. Someone should test out putting them separately
Could we see the before/after functions?
I [read](https://stackoverflow.com/a/38259091/5972766) that I have to implement \_\_hash\_\_ and either \_\_eq\_\_ or \_\_cmp\_\_. Is this it?
masses don't add up :/
What do you mean?
1. Its C++ instead of python, which gives a 10x-50x speed improvement 2. Its optimized for matrix math, so if your code can be converted to matrix operations you could get another 10x improvement totalling 100x to 500x faster.
Just finished RC 1 of a little side project. It let's build skeleton-files for your projects with a simple template-language. [https://github.com/smertiens/contemply](https://github.com/smertiens/contemply)
If your masses collide they don't "join". Still impressive :)
I'll run this using the monster computer I have at work. :D And yeah, I agree with other users here. It can definitely use use some optimizations using Numpy vectorization.
Goto editors for code on windows are usually atom/notepad++
You are definitely ready. Go out there and try to figure out other codebases. It’s never too early to start doing that. Just remember that not every codebase you will be working with well be written. Actually most codebases in companies where you might work in the future will probably be complete garbage. So get used to reading bad code as well ;)
If your arrays are being kept on disk instead of RAM, I don't think using SIMD and optimized functions will help much on performance...
I'm working on re-writing my web-crawler for an internal company app, currently it uses selenium because they didn't want to give me an access token and preferred that use the GUI. Ain't nobody got time for that. Finally after a year I recently going that their paged have an auth token embedded into it because of all the JS calls. After tracing some vaguely named calls, I can extract the token with BS4 and then use it with cookies inside of aiohttplib to scrape them much faster. Next project is an Alexa app, here is the git for it:[Link](https://github.com/hpca01/MedReminder) That one is fun, basically trying to make an app to help patients get information about their prescriptions.
I'm not sure if vectorizing these calculations would offset the overhead of working with numpy arrays. Easier thing to do is just re-implement the main calculation in Cython - it increases the speed like 5 fold without having to do anything. I'm sure you could do even better if you re-wrote a few more functions and stopped iterating on pure python objects [https://github.com/blakebjorn/python\_gravity\_simulation\_pygame](https://github.com/blakebjorn/python_gravity_simulation_pygame)
1. Pygame would be one of the easier to learn game libraries in my opinion. 2. I personally use PyCharm but Atom would be a lot simpler to use comparatively.
2) PyCharm. There's a free edition. You can remove may panes/toolbars that clutter the interface to make it easier on the eyes.
Didn't mean to say RAM \^\^ Still: NumPy Arrays benefit from contiguos RAM addresses
You're calculating the sqrt to square it again right after. You can calculate the sin/cos directly from the deltas as well. And if you really needed to do the sqrt, I think in cpython doing a ** 0.5 should be faster than calling math.sqrt
Yes, my answer was half sarcastic, haha. Actually, contiguous arrays often help keeping the entire array in the CPU caches, so you won't even hit RAM that often.
Awesome!
Ok so no, and why would nasa have any interest in lying about globe earth anyway? It's like if the goverment is watching us, who cares? Not like seing you naked is going to matter to them. What will matter? Nuclear weapon building. I don't get you people.
I've got a [github repo](https://github.com/benrules2/nbody) with the basics of gravity simulations for python and C++... FYI is numpy doesn't do the trick, C++ will leave a lot more room for optimization. (And before someone recommends C or Fortran, C++ is so much nicer to use as the code base grows it's worth the 0.2% performance hit!)
If you're really looking into optimizing the program you might want to take a look at Cython! Memory view in particular might be interesting (instead of using NumPy Arrays)
Excellent answer!
Even my home computer is 4x as powerful. So once you make the changes let me know and I can probably run it an order of magnitude bigger
You want to use a dictionary here. Also, /r/learnpython.
Sure I will a little later tonight.
The issue is that when you use input it automatically converts it to a string. You have to convert it back to integer using int(base_month)
That's really not helpful.
I would like the API to allow for a list of columns and then plot them all on the x or y axis. Here is how I'm doing that with cufflinks now (also graphing on multiple axes). "yaxis" and "yaxis2" are lists of columns from my dataframe. fig2 = dfgb.iplot(kind='bar',barmode='stack', columns=yaxis, secondary_y=yaxis, asFigure=True).to_plotly_json() fig1 = dfgb.iplot(kind='scatter',mode='lines+markers', columns=yaxis2, xTitle=str(groupby_list), asFigure=True).to_plotly_json() fig2['data'].extend(fig1['data']) Thanks for building such incredible tools for me to play with :)!
Django, Flask, AWS, API, Agile Dev, Docker, Linux, Cloud Computing and finally Machine Learning. I'm not saying you should know them all, but these are the most demanded ones afaik.
API is definitely on my radar it keeps popping up on job postings. thank you!
All good, best of luck!

If you want to really optimize calculation of n-body in any programming language, check out (barnes-Hut trees)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes%E2%80%93Hut_simulation]. For each step you create an octree of all bodies. Then iterate all bodies and traverse the octree to calculate forces on that body. For distant nodes in the octree you just stop at the nodes close to the root of the tree which provides a weighted average of all bodies contained in the child nodes, which can drastically reduce the number of calculations performed.
**Barnes–Hut simulation** The Barnes–Hut simulation (named after Josh Barnes and Piet Hut) is an approximation algorithm for performing an n-body simulation. It is notable for having order O(n log n) compared to a direct-sum algorithm which would be O(n2).The simulation volume is usually divided up into cubic cells via an octree (in a three-dimensional space), so that only particles from nearby cells need to be treated individually, and particles in distant cells can be treated as a single large particle centered at the cell's center of mass (or as a low-order multipole expansion). This can dramatically reduce the number of particle pair interactions that must be computed. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
I don’t know how this all works but if you can find my posts and see the replies in r/learn python I was given some great advise.
I would respectfully say, that I don't agree about Cython. I've made both large projects in Cython and NumPy, and if you get to learn NumPy, you will in these use cases -- like simulations -- get consistently better results with NumPy, and a big standard library of functions. But Cython still has its upsides, when it comes to more generic processing. I have a project, that saw a speed-up of 50-150x because of Cython compared to PyPy (closer to 500x times compared to CPython), which NumPy couldn't do in that use-case.
Yeah no. Arbitrarily modifying and executing source code, *especially via fucking regex* is stupid and dangerous, and can lead to unforeseen problems.
I don't agree. If performance and type safety are a problem, they are so everywhere, not only in a desktop application. Python is slow, it's true, but for non cpu-bound applications the majority of the processor time is spent outside the Python interpreter, like inside the Qt libraries, in the OS or waiting for I/O. The Python code is just the director that links other compiled components together. And for cpu-bound code there is plenty of choice to move only the performance-critical parts outside the interpred code using other compiled languages. I used Python + Qt a lot for desktop applications, I'm really satisfied by its reliabilty and time to delivery, and I will use it again in the future.
I recently commented my opinion on that [here in this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/blkdp9/a_comparison_of_poetry_vs_other_tools/emvfb2h). Essentially, `requirements.txt` used with `pip-tools` and a few handy shell aliases already achieve what pipenv does, in a faster, simpler, more workflow agnostic way, without creating new (or recreating old) problems.
It is actually helpful for what OP wants to do.

gravity is suprisingly strong even for unbelievably long ranges. so that does not work. another problem pretty unique to numerical astrophysic is that the mass density varies extremely over the domain of a cluster. so you need very adaptive methods to actually simulated it.
Hi! Do you know dictionaries? If you don’t know how to use it, I can help you. About the input, every input is convert to string, and for what I know, you can’t convert it to a string. I’m a little busy right now, maybe later I can make a schema or sample code. Don’t give up!
Been toying around with Go lately.
They are generated from the C++ docs. They're there, but it's hit-and-miss with quality. Overall, Qt's docs are of great quality.
You want to use this. base_month = eval(input("Month: "))
If you want to move the whole show into python, you could try Pandas. Or xlWings might suit you, it lets you manipulate Excel from python.
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar.
I'd prefer not since it'll give away my name. It's about 750 lines between the two. It parses things like `1 THRU 10 BY 2` which results in 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10. It also supports `1 THRU 10 BY 2 EXCEPT 5, 7, 12`, which excludes values as long as the values after the exclude are monotonically increasing. It also supports `1.0 2.0` and `SOMESTRING`.
That did it! I have no idea how or why but it works perfectly now!
You don’t need the Euclidean distance, you need the Euclidean distance *squared*. You could just do 1/(x1*x2+y1*y2) for 1/r^2
Eval() removes the quotation marks from the input, so instead of "10" you get 10.
I'm reading the W3Schools entry on dictionaries, but it doesn't really make any sense. An example would be great, thank you. :)
I suggest Pandas as well, that's a really powerful module
That is so much simpler and easier to understand than anything else I've been reading... XD Thank you!
Thanks for the answer. But can I see and manipulate my spreadsheets in real time(like I would be able to in Excel) in Pandas?
Is sarcasm dead? Did you read the post I was responding to. They were saying we cannot make meaningful calculations outside of the classroom.
Glad I could help. I'm pretty new to this stuff too, so I frequent r/learnpython quite a bit myself.
Not trying to make a case against numpy (I'm sure at a certain N it would become the only plausible way to do this, but at small N's cython would likely beat out the np.array overhead) - I was just pointing out that translating this to cython takes minutes, whereas translating it to numpy involves making a completely different program. The biggest bottleneck for me (with cython) is the pygame rendering anyways, so I'm not sure astronomical performance gains in the underlying math department would do much for the end user in either case (obviously that could be sped up as well using arrays)
flake8-strict (https://github.com/smarkets/flake8-strict) seems to be doing the same thing.

I hope it helps you # key: value months = {"October":10, "November":11} print(months["October"]) months["December"] = 12 # Add december key print(months) user_input = input("Write a month ") print(months[user_input])
I think more and more people these days use an API rather than directly using an SMTP server. e.g. SendGrid
No, no, no, please don't.
Please don't use `eval`. It doesn't just "remove the quotation marks", it runs the user input as Python code, which means the user can now do anything your program can just by typing in a "broken" input. Don't use `eval`.
I am going to see this now! thank a lot!

Hey, I'm on a FRC team as well. I was a student this year and will mentor next year, since my team is based out of the college I'm attending. And you're right, programming is a hard area for FRC students, both to teach and to learn. Are you looking for ways to teach your programming students as whole during the off season and stuff, or just as a one day activity?
I seem to always underestimate the effort of a project and I don't like the negotiating part of it
Wait so like you're saying that using eval() basically creates "enter code here"? So in a big system you could hack it or something if you use eval() in the code?
Wwhen I learn any new language, I prefer to do editing in a plain text format (like notepad) without any syntax colors or highlights. That way I am completely forced to learn the language, and there is no autocomplete to help me along. If I am typing every single character I am more likely to remember it next time and better learn what is going on. That's me though.
I would consider running your code in an IPython notebook using the pandas library for data manipulation combined with another tool (perhaps QGrid) that might enable the real time interactivity that you mentioned.
It might seem like that if we look at return values in the REPL/interactive Python loop. But it really doesn't. The "thing" with the quotation marks is a string. What eval does is that it evaluates the string as if it was an expression. That is, the user enters some expression-like code and Python treats it almost as if the programmer had written it. Here is a more complex example which shows that it doesn't just "remove" quotation marks: &gt;&gt;&gt; user_command = input("Enter value:") Enter value:5 + 5 &gt;&gt;&gt; user_command # what did the user enter? '5 + 5' &gt;&gt;&gt; type(user_command) # what is this thing anyway? &lt;class 'str'&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; eval(user_command) 10 &gt;&gt;&gt; my_binding = "hello" # we'll use this like your October example &gt;&gt;&gt; command = input("Enter a value: ") Enter a value: my_binding &gt;&gt;&gt; eval(command) # what would we get back if we wrote my_binding? 'hello' https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/functions.html#eval This obscures some issues (like scoping), but I think gets the gist of it. It's probably not the best pattern to start to lean on, as it obscures the difference between different kinds of values, and identifiers/names a fair bit. Also, it allows the user to run arbitrary code. If you're fine with the user writing 10 for October (instead of writing the word and having your code convert it, eg by the dictionary trick above) you can use int(input(...)). If the user writes October, this will of course crash. So the dictionary trick is probably better in terms of understanding what happens!
Don't what?...
No idea
 &gt;&gt;&gt; month = eval(input("Enter the right month here: ")) # totally cool, right? Enter the right month here: [exec("import subprocess"), subprocess.Popen("bash")] &gt;&gt;&gt; [now you've got a system terminal running] $
In my experience, W3Schools is often confusing or even wrong. They are better at SEO than actually teaching anything. You could check out the Python tutorial: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html You'll probably want to start at section 3, and just take you'll time going through it all.
Don't use eval unless you really have to. (Despite some tutorials, including the otherwise great book by Zelle, doing so).
Simple tools, hands down. An IDE is helpful when you know what you're doing but want to automate a bunch of boring tasks, such as hunting down definitions of things across the codebase, jumping directly to error locations, or looking up documentation by hovering over the thing you're interested in. But when it comes to learning a programming language, less is more - all those bells and whistles designed to help the expert are going to be a confusing distraction, and may lull you into a false sense of security. A simple setup with just a barebones text editor and a REPL running side by side will make it more obvious what's really happening; you will be driving the toolchain almost directly, with nothing getting in between and obscuring things (no matter how well intentioned). This goes for any programming language, but Python especially is a language that lends itself well to a minimalist setup. So well, in fact, that plenty of professionals will still use a very similar stack - a powerful text editor like, say, vim or sublime, a terminal, and a bunch of command-line utilities.
Yes, that's exactly what it does.
Don't use `eval` and especially don't tell people to use `eval`.
For such a simple program though its fairly easy and foolproof way of getting the desired result.
GIL isnt usually a factor in Numpy unless you actually thread your code.
What exactly do you mean by "really slow"?
Putting that in your previous comment would probably have saved time.
This is exactly why I was considering ditching PyCharm. I don't want that false sense of security. Thanks for your advice.
I'm aware of API options like SendGrid for sending emails, but I'm primarily interested in receiving emails rather than sending them.
After you edited: Don't you contradict yourself in saying "NumPy arrays are fast" and " Using the NumPy functions for add, sub, div, mul and so on to substitute for-loops, is really fast"?
Thanks for your comments. It will be pygame and atom. :)
That's the point - with pyenv you don't have to think about it any more. Just create .python-version file inside your project folder with virtual env name as its contents and that's it. Works like a breeze. You can find it here: [https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv) and here [https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/) With pyenv it's very easy to have different python versions in the same machine without polluting global environment etc. I don't have any stake in pyenv, I'm just a fan :)
Additionally to the other answers: NumPy code has been written, rewritten and optimised by programmers fighting tooth and nail to make it faster.
Not a silly question! It is a 2D simulation. I haven't handled the case where 2 bodies collide with each other, hence they just go through each other. Introducing collision detection in this simulation would be really interesting though! :D
Thanks a lot! 😬
Hey OrionPixels, great to see that you are progressing with your sim! Keep up the good work. I'm seeing that everyone here is throwing concepts at you -- throw some Numba at it, maybe sprinkle it with NumPy. Don't feel overwhelmed by them, you'll pick up those things along the way. I'd suggest an iterative path forward to really see what works and what not. For instance, I see that you are having a slight numerical inaccuracy. You have two loops, the outer (line 64 in your code) and the inner one (line 70). This means that for a pair of bodies A and B, assuming A is before B in the list `bodies`, you will first calculate the force of B on A, change hte vector and position of A, then calculate the force of re-positioned A on B. This means that the force A on B and force B on A will not be the same. It's not a huge difference, but it will mean that the energy in your system will not be constant and as you step through time, the error will acummulate. It also means that you are calculating the same force between each pair *twice* for no good reason. If you get rid of that, you double the speed of your calculation, and you get rid of numerical errors! Secondly, I would check how much time you spend in the `math.sqrt()` function. Is math.sqrt(x) faster or slower than `x**0.5`? Is `x**2` faster or slower than `x*x`? You might be surprised by the result. Here, it makes sense to check out how to use a [https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html](profiler). Using a class `Body` is really inefficient since you are only using it to store variables. At this point, you might start using NumPy to create lists (technically *vectors*) of masses, positions and forces. It will make your code faster and from then on, it is organic to switch to vectorized operations in NumPy.... Good luck on your trip with Python simulations!
8 planets in neat circles in the same plane and most spinning in same direction. Points to common origin of all 8. Not random for sure. A remnant of planetary disk, created from initial dust cloud. Planeys are in perfect orbits because thats where they formed
Since everyone is really excited about this on r/python, maybe think about documenting your progress and make a youtube tutorial/video at the end when you are happy with the result and performance.
I would recommend you use a text editor when learning. Gedit is very bare bones so it might be worth considering alternatives like Atom or Visual Studio Code. These support fancy plugins, which you can use later. My reasoning for this is that IDEs like PyCharm may hide certain processes from you, such as running a script or importing libraries. These concepts are key to really understanding a programming language.
I started using pycharm right away. Really useful the autocomplete function when calling variables or functions. Once learned the hotkeys I spent more time on actual learning that fiddling with nonsense like typo errors
Can you make a solar system (with maybe even the planet's satellites) with stable orbits?
The last sentence in you comment really are words to live by. In some cases it might be that your skills need to improve and in others it might be that your understanding and knowledge of the problem needs to increase. This isn't limited to programming but is relevant for all types of development.
It's not foolproof - it's not safe from me. :) More importantly (and apologies if I sounded harsh, by the way!): I think that it's easy to lose the distinction between code and input if we start playing around in Python as a first language and go down this path. The language (and REPL) doesn't really hit us over the head in the same way that a compiled language might. And it's an important distinction to understand, and a boundary to uphold even if you might find some scripting application that goes against it. Not just for security reasons (don't trust user input), but for something as simple as distinguishing the string October from the identifier October (which might be bound to something else). So it's not so much that it doesn't get to the desired result of moving from user input "October" to the integer 10 without changing much of the original code - it does! - but that it is a pattern that might be rather unhelpful down the line on the journey to learning to program (and not that far down the line).
Legally, not sure. Unethically you could scrape it using bs4 and compare data that way. Step one: Apply for a free key to the zip code api. The use that zip code api to find zip codes by area. (This is your locator part) Step two: Find a way to pull the websites for those zip codes for the theaters. This may require you to scrape Google or use another API Step three: Assuming those websites use similar tags, scrape them and transform as needed. Step four: Display data on site Step five (probably): Receive cease and desist notice from one or more theaters for taking their data and publishing it without consent on a website.
[This](https://gist.github.com/quonic/1591e84806c189b27fec82b320f5a532) is what I got working. It only really handles the mass adding and logic of removing collided objects. It's super simple. I also tried to utilize jit to help improve performance, but I didn't notice any significant improvements.
Man I never can spell anything right. Thanks!
Well it's really too bad that this has been [done before](https://python-future.org/translation.html) [several times](https://github.com/asottile/future-fstrings), then isn't. While I agree the system shouldn't have to exist, desperate things are done to fix the nightmare of python 2 to 3 breaking things. And while regex might be used in both, lib2to3 fixers that do the transformation are much more powerful than regex. I would appreciate your criticisms more if they were something other than just incorrect assumptions.
Hey, i really recommend looking into the [Barnes-Hut Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes%E2%80%93Hut_simulation). It will take your code from O(n\^2) to O(nlogn). I think its definitely a good next step for you! I wrote one a few years back in C++ and really enjoyed it.
 I’m not an enginner yet, i’m still studying, thanks a lot for the info!
Because it's 2019.

Oh, that sounds complicated! I don’t wanna get into all that asking for permission and whatnot... How do comparison websites work? You know them websites that compare prices of a product on multiple different websites... thanks
You can get O(nlogn) by using the [Barnes-Hut Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes%E2%80%93Hut_simulation). Its a tree based approach that makes use of the fact that a group of objects with a summed mass and combined center of gravity has the same gravitational effect as a the sum of the individual gravitational forces. It allows for a top down dynamic programming approach. &amp;#x200B; Since OP is only doing 2D simulations you only need to use a [QuadTree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree), but for 3D simulations you can use the same algorithm with an [Octree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octree).
The moon is spiraling out at about the rate fingernails grow. The theory is that it was formed from a collision with another planet about the size of Mars so it was formed from debris from the impact and its slowing moving away.
When I program in a new language, I do usually prefer something that does syntax highlighting. But nothing else. No auto-complete, etc. I also think learning to call all of the python related commands from the shell directly is pretty important. Using built in magic from pycharm does leave you not knowing some of the important steps.
&gt; I would appreciate your criticisms more if they were something other than just incorrect assumptions. I would appreciate your shit more if you gave one. I *read your source code*. You're doing regex replacement using lib2to3 fixers, dynamically on code. Python-future *does not do this*, it replaces objects by name, ex, like `mock` (or `unittest.mock`). lib2to3 based fixers are done *statically* ***only***. Now, directly from future-fstrings: &gt; future-fstrings has two parts: &gt; A utf-8 compatible codec which performs source manipulation &gt; The codec first decodes the source bytes using the UTF-8 codec &gt; The codec then ***leverages tokenize-rt*** to rewrite f-strings. &gt; A .pth file which registers a codec on interpreter startup. Emphasis mine. Not fucking regex. You don't parse code with fucking regex to automatically apply source transformations. Not to mention the greater ease in exploiting the security hole that dynamic self-modifying code is, ***Python has an AST parser for a reason***. Don't try to bullshit anyone with "I did what had to be done". This is an absolutely horrendous and unsafe solution to a problem that barely exists anymore *because of the libraries mentioned and used by you*. The only thing you have allowed for here is for danger to enter production systems.
Use "pip3 install pyinstaller"

He is saying "Using a NumPy array doesn't magically make things faster. You have to also use NumPy's operators."
Not a clue. Here's what you can do though. Google "pip install pyinstaller failed error code 1". It'll likely get you on the right path.
im thinking print version but idk
Ah nice! That's a great way to take into account that gravitation of two masses can be seen as one mass. That explained why I got only few hits when searching for PME in N-body simulations.
General rule of programming is that using global variables makes programs hard to use and they should be used sparingly or not at all. The reason is simple, if a variable can be modified anywhere, anytime then it is difficult to understand what code is responsible when literally any code could have modified it. Obviously it's still a feature in most languages but it is a dangerous one. I would suggest instead of having global variables, use object orientation to attach state to particular code or just pass variables in and out of functions.
Correct
I think what you need is a module, a module contains a library of multiple defined functions. For example, Python has a module referred to as Standard Library. And it has functions like math, random etc. Modules blocks of code commonly written by other people which can then be used to add functions into your code. SOoO if you'd like to write a module here's this link: [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-write-modules-in-python-3](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-write-modules-in-python-3)
Accessing a NumPy array as an array is inherently slow, as it will need to exit the context of Python, do something in the NumPy backend, and return. Each step takes quite some time, and often a few conversions of types are involved.
Yeah, that purple mass DOIN WORKK. Definitely violating many laws here but very cool.
I take your point but it's not like its so incredibly cumbersome... from collections import defaultdict def create\_dict(): return defaultdict(create\_dict) nested\_dict = create\_dict() Just one function using `collections.defaultdict`

It's already "built-in;" what're you having difficulty with?
If you specifically need variables such as API Token, you could use Environments Variable. These variables are stored safely on the machine you are using. On Windows, you can use a shell command such as: `$ export API_TOKEN=the_api_token` Then, you import the variables where needed in your code, usually in your main.py, with: `from os import API_TOKEN as token`
Unfortunately, that didn't work.
\-v enables verbose mode, it explicitely lists all imported modules (even the modules module uses), but other then that it is still the same good old python and once you restart it, it should work as before
That is not the point either. It was just to underline, that it leaves the Python context fully.
In the future, you can use `python --help` (or `python -h`) to get short information about python's command line options (and usage in general). ***** `-v` prints a message each time a module is initalized or cleaned up.
OK I must be missing it. Can you show me in one line how to get a nested key from a dict, without needing to implement error/exception handling or loops or anything else? &amp;#x200B; Conversely being able to set?
Many APIs can do that too, including Sendgrid. [https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/parsing-email/setting-up-the-inbound-parse-webhook/](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/parsing-email/setting-up-the-inbound-parse-webhook/)
Well, if you would have converted your app 10 years ago, you would just shrug this off. It's been known for a long time that Py2 support was coming to and end. Why would you assume libraries would continue to support something that is no longer supported?
The get method handles exceptions. But the dictionary is a single level mapping that happens to allow dictionaries add contents. Try logging a single dictionary where the keys are tuples of multiple keys. That will be more efficient
This doesn't strike me a particularly readable/understandable construct. I'm an ordinary programmer - I couldn't glance at this and know in a second what it's doing.
It's a matter of familiarity and documentation. Personally if I needed a nestable dict I'd subclass dict and override \`\_\_getitem\_\_\` which would be much more digestible. Would also be more code but that's the trade off.
Kivy is an awesome framework. Congrats to the Kivy team on the new release.
Thank you for your reply, my code works, it's just that I want to store all my global variables in one place and be able to use them without having to write all global things, so my code looks better.
Having experienced the same bug as you, it looks like when bodies collide, they're accelerating stupidly quickly which causes them to shoot off after colliding
Is there a hidden third dimension? If not you might find fewer close interactions if you added it.
We could continue this or do something new
what [MarsupialMole](https://www.reddit.com/user/MarsupialMole/) said is a good way to go about it, but if that is not practical, there is no builtin way to easily get nested keys that i know of, however you can [make a custom class for it](https://gist.github.com/9079582c0d6bdc78cd3919cee4ee3891) or a [multi-key getter function](https://gist.github.com/4ff7f63056456c96f5ad03edef956d3b) &amp;#x200B; but other than that, the only way i know of is to do it the usual way with mutliple \[\], or a bunch of .get's with defaults that allow guaranteed chaining
You can run it locally, access it out of a web browser and hit a local database.
Great to hear that you got it working! I wanted to echo the guy you're replying to quickly. Using global variables is generally considered bad practice, for many of the reasons OP mentioned. Many bugs are introduced by some variation of "I expected variable x to have value y, but it had value z instead". Debugging these problems generally starts by identifying the bits of your code that have access to x. But if that variable is global, your whole program potentially has access to it. If you stick to local variables and minimize mutation, it's _much_ easier to walk that path from error to identifying potentially buggy code to implementing a solution. Depending on your use case, better alternatives may include storing those variables in a class (if you'd like to bundle them with functions that operate over those variables, aka methods) or in a module.
He means poorly written numpy code (code that uses for loops and if statements) will be \~3x slower than by using stock Python for loops and the builtin math functions. Properly written numpy code overtakes stock Python when you hit array sizes greater than about 10 and sizes of 100k-1M are typical for what I do. Properly written numpy code is often 1000x faster than the stock Python code and if you don't do it quite right, but don't do it terribly, 500x speedups are pretty common as well. Throw in a better algorithm that's N log(N) vs. N\^2 and you'll probably get another factor of 1000x for some reasonable problem size. Thankfully, numpy and scipy comes with a lot of those algorithms, so you just pick them off the shelf. KDTrees are awesome and you better make sure you pick the right sparse matrix type. Don't know how to pick the right sparse matrix type? There's only a few; run through the list; that's an easy factor of 500x.
Probably this: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getforegroundwindow https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setforegroundwindow Not sure though. But the [win32gui API](http://docs.activestate.com/activepython/2.6/pywin32/win32gui__GetForegroundWindow_meth.html) has [the same signature](http://docs.activestate.com/activepython/2.6/pywin32/win32gui__SetForegroundWindow_meth.html) as these functions, so. Probably.
I use foo.get(‘bar’, {}).get(‘baz’, {}).get(‘val’) if need be. No idea if others will think this is terrible.
I guess it depends on your goals. If you are a complete programming newbie then there is some logic in doing it yourself. Getting the experience of writing all the code and fighting through all the errors can be satisfying and educational. But if you’ve forgotten more programming languages than you remember then Python is the same sh*t different syntax. A powerful IDE like Pycharm is a godsend to help with debugging and catching typos. Autocomplete is golden and saves tons of typing. Quite frankly I have work to do and an IDE like PyCharm saves me a ton of time.
The real answer is because it's passed to optimized c code.
Check out arcade.acedemy. It's probably perfect for your use case.
 foo = d.get('level_one', {}).get('level_two', {}).get('level_three', None) Will get three levels deep if it exists and return None if it doesn't. And this will set multiple layers deep d.setdefault('level_one', {}).setdefault('level_two', {}).setdefault('level_three', 7) &gt;&gt;&gt; d {'level_one': {'level_two': {'level_three': 7}}} This is dumb of course, but you insisted on a one-line answer so there you go. The correct way of course is to use `defaultdict` or exception handling. You have to realise that your use case is specific, and whilst Python could have a datatype just for you, it is more powerful to have something like `defaultdict` that handles other use cases too. It's not going to be confusing to many people if you use one, that is what they are for.
&gt; Using a tree code to group distant particles as an approximation would greatly reduce the runtime of the simulation. Are you suggesting something like a quad-tree -- to ignore bodies too far away? I've seen quadtrees for collision detection where this is straight forward. Couldn't you have problems with bodies being in different regions yet still strong enough to affect each other?
That's why you deploy it to AWS or Google App Engine, let their computers fried instead.
If you have Excel/VBA skills you should really want to learn Python.
Google doesn't agree that I'm the only person interested in directly setting and getting values in dicts: &amp;#x200B; [https://www.google.com/search?q=access+nested+dict+in+python](https://www.google.com/search?q=access+nested+dict+in+python)
Yes exactly, the force becomes very large when the points are close, velocity shoots up, and the accuracy of the simulator breaks. The velocity killing wall keep all the masses in bounds and moving at reasonable velocities
Do you have any links to tutorials or simple examples that show this?
That sounds like the code isn't checking radii for actual collision, but considering everything an infinitely small point with a massless "color" around it. Since the (floating) points don't ever actually hit, it makes the distance super small, and the gravity super large.
What are the applications for which a dict of dict of dict is better than a single dict on a hashable tuplet of keys? I should think that a single layer dict might often be performance. One ought test that conjecture though before assuming it.
Could you explain more about this approach please? I don't know the comparison you are referring to.
 from is import API_TOKEN as token What voodoo is this??
That's pretty cool, I'm impressed, but 2.5c a text is a lot compared to Plivo's 0.5c a text. (I have no connection to either company).
The absence of the GIL in the C code that numpy executes is absolutely a factor when that C code spins up threads. The person using numpy doesn't need to be aware of this.
A single layer dict (using dict comprehensions) would look like: ` d = {('alma','bertha','carol'): 'meow'} print('Cat goes ' + d[('alma','bertha','carol')]) ` where as the dict of dict solution looks like ` d = {'alma': {bertha: {'carol': 'meow'}}} print('Cat goes ' + d['alma']['bertha']['carol']) `
Just to clarify for other people coming across this. They don't mean that np.add() is faster than the + operator; the + operator used on numpy arrays will still call np.add(). What's faster is processing vectors of data by using the SIMD operations on your CPU.
you can only do this in javascript if all the subjects are actually subobjects and none of them are undefined; so really you're asking for `__getattr__` to return the same as `__getitem__`. there exist plenty of plenty of packages which handle implement this and handle all the nuance (look on pypi for attrdict, objdict, box, addict) or more basically be implemented in [3 or 4 lines of python](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4984647/accessing-dict-keys-like-an-attribute). In any case this will never be made default because it's a huge backwards incompatible change
Show what? I mentioned like 3 things.
Oh, my bad then. It honestly just seemed a lot like it wasn't sarcasm. Thanks for the pointer!
I like it. I wonder what the downside it?
I came across this recently. The kid in his post is younger, but I agree that Mu is a nice environment for newbies to learn in. https://www.mattlayman.com/blog/2019/teach-kid-code-pygame-zero/
Treat the cli the same as a webbrower reporting usage stats; quasi-untrusted. That could be like boomerang + boomcatch. Or just use statsd directly; very lightweight. Maybe with graphite+graphana as the backend. Or if you control the server too, don't worry about the cli usage in isolation. Instead give the cli a custom useragent string and capture/measure the API calls it makes within your platform.
One is that if you want to re-organize the hierarchy and move branches of the tree around, this could be slow as you have to update a lot of keys.

Learn by building. Make a project and try out new libraries. If you haven’t messed with pandas or spark I highly recommend it if you’re into data. Django if you wanna develop something web based. Or just automate something for fun, like sending text messages or emails to clients or family on their birthdays
Yeah I couldn't agree more the best way to get better is simply just by making shit. Every piece of software is unique and getting it to work correctly is a learning experience all the way through.(plus you'll have something for your resume)
 On my phone, so lazy, but a normal vector for a triangle is calculated as n = (p2-p1) x (p3 - p1) nunit = n / |n| So I can calculate a cross product (6 multiplications and 3 additions), and an distance formula/L2-norm/vector magnitude (3 squares, 3 additions, and a sqrt). Then do 3 divisions. Do that for 100k elements. Or: n= np.cross(p2-p1, p3-p1) ni = np.linalg.norm(x, axis=1) nunit = n / ni[:, np.newaxis] 3 lines of denser code that runs almost entirely in C.
I'm working on an API that calls out to the EPA Energy Star Portfolio Manager website to extract information regarding building details. I am successful in pulling everything back but am still VERY new to OOP so I'm stuck on one last part. Hoping someone can help. The last hump is, How do I create an object in the class that changes everytime it is iterated over? For example, say I'm iterating through a list and want to grab 3 things and assign to a variable. Then the next time it goes through, I want it to grab the same information (from the new iteration) but create a new variable in the class. So at the end, my class will have all of the iteration variables, and all the information from each iteration. (if this doesn't make sense I can try to edit and add more detail)
Thank you very much!
&gt; I would appreciate your shit more if you gave one. lol &gt; You're doing regex replacement I'm doing *gasp* very simple pattern matching, even worse than regex! The regex is just cuz I didnt feel like writing another meta_path just to handle the __fixes__ modules. &gt; Python-future does not do this it sure does do this, it just uses a hardcoded list of allowed modules to apply to instead of looking at the file itself. And turns out, this list can be modified *gasp* at run time. This has limitations, the biggest is not being able to use python-futures translations on directly run modules &gt; lib2to3 based fixers are done statically only. I mean sure if you only look at lib2to3. python-future sure lets you run fixers at import time &gt; Python has an AST parser for a reason. and it fails quite badly in certain situations &gt; This is an absolutely horrendous and unsafe solution it sure is &gt; muh security hole, muh production systems then dont run it. Do you double check every last one of your dependencies for weird PTHs or weird meta_paths? do you verify the wheels match the source? if you dont understand where the code you are running is coming from then dont complain about weird non malicious packages doing weird shit with meta_path thanks for looking at my code tho &lt;3
 is it trivial to make an object orbit another with like a single function or click?

Orbits are unexpectedly finicky, often times the smaller planets get launched. I just tweak the initial conditions until there is some stable orbit. Also the size of the planets are logarithmic with their mass, so larger ones are orders magnitude more massive, that is why the two orbiting planets are in stable orbit while sending the others flying

Having gone from Excel/VBA to Python, I can attest to this statement. At the other end, there are python ERPs as well (e.g., Odoo).
That’s an interesting idea though it makes introspection a bit harder. Certainly not impossible though. I do wonder about performance. Dictionary lookups are O(n) but it can still be a difference in speed.
I was interested in building a game about a year ago and found the [Roguelike Tutorial](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python3%2Btdl,_part_1) to be a decent introduction. I remember running into a few problems while working through it (like any old or semi-old tutorial), but it was manageable. I remember some people arguing that the writer's code was anti-pythonic or messy or whatever, but again it's somewhere to start, and it somewhat fills the RPG element. Anyway, good luck!
Yes. Just pass the file name.
Mate, it's right there in the docs: https://lxml.de/parsing.html
What resources did you use to learn python? How much time has this project saved you? I presume you used Django to deploy the project?
Sounds reasonable. The only reason I didn't choose that route was because I thought it was kind of complicated. Is it though? Because if this route is better I might just drop that package management stuff and go to the common python route. It's also easier to get pretty much everything working with that, since almost every tutorial out there uses requirements.txt. Honestly, out of all the arguments presented I like yours best.
How did you learn to write all of that code? Seems like quite an impressive code base!
Python 3.0 wasn’t worth using though. It wasn’t until 3.5 that the switch made sense. Libraries had finally been ported and python 3 was finally faster.
I'd say that NumPy and SciPy are essential for anyone in quantitative fields using Python.
That continuum line bothered me too. Python is useful for end-user tools, custom apps, does the work of those "other tools", can be used in ERP, etc. Heck, my editor runs Python plug-ins, several of my tools can be scripted with Python, my database (PostgreSQL) runs Python, my spreadsheet (LibreOffice Calc) can run Python (as can Excel with the right plugin), my accounting software has a Python interface, my math program (Sage) runs Python, my documentation generator runs Python, my ebook/PDF/document manager is written with Python and uses Python plugins,my version control system can be extended with Python, data mining suites such as RapidMiner and Kinime can run Python, even my shell runs Python (Xonsh)! (This is just off the top of my head; probably a lot more Python around here). So one sense, where Python belongs in many organizations could be answered with "almost everywhere". :-)
Is it possible to add code that when collision happens, the objects are removed from the system, so that the remaining bodies will then have to reorient themselves gravitationally and form a new movement/orbit? That would be interesting to observe, i.e. what formation later results as as a stable gravitational configuration.
Thanks. So basically, become familiar with all the linear algebra functions in numpy and use those whenever possible, and avoid for loops and such as much as possible?
dont. SMTP is a nightmare to automate. get o365 and use corresponding python.
The Docs pdf I downloaded was over 500 pages long I wasn't exactly sure where to look an don't have that kinda time. Thanks though.
Why would you not google something like "python rpg tutorial" first?
VERY strongly recommend you look into uDemy then. Ultra-cheap courses. Amazing tutorials on anything you could want.
Dude,every time you post it's r/gifsthatendtoosoon ;-(
Sublime Text for the win. Also, instead of a game, what about an app/script that helps in another way (life-wise) that makes a boring/timesink process quicker/easier? Maybe something her friends could also collaborate/build together as well?
Something seems very wrong here...
its because of the break at the last line. That inner while is only ever gonna loop once per outer while... therefore, the outer loop will append a '1' from the streak var between every incrementing c\_streak integer
but also... im not sure exactly what you are trying to accomplish, but it can almost certainly be accomplished much cleaner/easier with list comprehension and collections.Counter
&gt;Are you suggesting something like a quad-tree -- to ignore bodies too far away? Not ignore them, but approximate them. As you get farther and farther away from a collection of masses (the surface of the earth with all its hills, valleys, nooks, and crannies), the more it starts looking smooth and sphere-like. Mathematically, the higher-order moments of the gravitational potential (dipole, quadrupole, octopole, etc.) that detail the "shape" of what your looking at fall off far faster than the monopole one (just the total mass), so they're not going to affect your calculation much as you get far away from your masses. Since the shape matters less as you get far away, you can get away with aggregating near masses together to reduce the number of long-range interactions you have to account for, via something like the Barnes-Hut or Fast Multipole methods.
For CPython, amortized worst case is O(n) while the average case is O(1): https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity
Seems like you're moving the goal posts here as you didn't implement error handling in your JavaScript example from your other comment: &gt; I'm not saying it should be the same as JavaScript, but in JavaScript I can say: &gt; to set: &gt; foo.bar.bas.bob.bom = 'blah'
I 100% meant O(1). Good catch
Yeah, a single dict lookup is devastatingly fast on average so that was the driving thought. Not sure how to fix introspect-ability and on the fly reorganization of the hierarchy though.
I’ve been tackling the same problem. Creating photo mosaics! It would be interesting to know your process/algorithm. My solution allows me to process a real-time mobile phone camera feed to create a video photo mosaic using a GLSL shader. I mostly used Python and the PIL module to render a sprite-sheet of the categorised images that gets referenced by the shader. Fun project! One challenge I found was that you need only a small number of different images when doing a mono mosaic, but colour requires hundreds of images to avoid banding.

There’s the the math aspect, but you need that anyways. You still need to validate your results to make sure you did the math right. I tried to choose something simple for that reason. I don’t think any of that is considered linear algebra though. It’s geometry in 3D. You see cross products all over and the L2 norm is a fancy way to write (a^2+b^2+...).^1/2. The 2 could just as easily be a 1 or an infinity, So take that one step further and add a requirement of find all the triangles that are dots. So A=0.5*ni, so it’s just, so you might think that you need an if statement or you can use where, which is basically the equivalent, so... Izero = no.where(ni == 0.0)[0] Then you can do slice your data similar to how it’s done with lists and maybe print the coordinates or the node ids of those points. The other big thing is np.searchsorted, which looksup where a value or many values would be inserted in an array. if you can have missing data, there are some extra steps you need to do to identify them, but it’s a core numpy vectorization function.
Not moving the goal posts, just wrong.

Forgive my ignorance but why would you need hundreds of images? Can’t you just take the “average”/most dominant color of every block of X by X pixels and use that as the color for that block?
If I had to pick just one thing (which of course you don't), I would recommend getting familiar with databases and SQL. So much of what gets programmed, especially in Python, at some point works with data. When I hire backend developers, I always look for people that have some experience manipulating databases (and ideally understand a little about how to design one). And, understanding databases will transcend any particular language or system you're using.
Hmmm. The first one I looked at was the [find only digits](https://github.com/devAmoghS/Python-Interview-Problems-for-Practice/blob/master/has_only_digits.py). # Given a string, check if it only contains digits def is_digit(input_str): digits = dict() for char in input_str: if char in digits: digits[char] += 1 else: digits[char] = 1 if sum(digits.values()) == len(input_str): return True else: return False result = is_digit("095357973590759530") print(result) # True I would do this: import re regex = re.compile(r"^\d+$") print("All digits") if regex.match('abc123') else print("Nope")
I'd go with - all([True if char in '0123456789' else False for char in input_str])
This is, in fact, still a question for /r/learnpython. Post there, and include the full output of the entire install process.
Am I missing something, or couldn't you just do: def is_digit(input_str): try: int(input_str) return True except: return False
There is also: is_digit = lambda x: x.isdigit()
For checking for anagram I would use: is_anagram = lambda x, y: set(x) == set(y) and len(x) == len(y)
Not quite, strings 'aab' and 'abb' would be anagrams with your code. Best way is a counter from collections
[removed]
It seems definition of anagram doesnt mention that all letters need to be used as many times as they appear, just at least once. Was confused about that too.
And the output is?
Just looking at the picture i thought it just took an image and made it look like you crocheted it...haha :'(
It's still plenty unoptimized but I felt pretty proud of it and wanted to share it with you guys. Here's the source code: [https://github.com/guille0/songoku](https://github.com/guille0/songoku)
Yep looking more closely you are correct, I suspect that solution is most likely also incorrect then as well as being super inefficient
Are we supposed to deduce the problem requirements from the file names?
Very nice work! Didn't look at the source, but application seems cool.
Niice. That's what I would have used. But I remembered there was something already done and after a search: `input_str.isdigit()`
Every cell of the final image maps to a colour on my spritesheet. Let’s say I categorise the colours by dividing the RGB colour ranges into 8 divisions. That would make 8 ^ 3 colours. That’s 512 different colour buckets. If we reduce the number of divisions, we get visible banding where we see the abrupt changes as colours approach the transition point to an adjacent bucket. The lowest number of divisions that looks ok is 6, but even that is 6 ^ 3. 216 different sprites required!
Thanks a lot for the help! Already working on the numerical inaccuracy part. And regarding the numpy vectors, should I make different numpy arrays for forces, masses, positions etc? eg : forces[0], masses[0], etc would give me the force and mass of the first body? I just thought that the object oriented approach would properly encapsulate all the properties of a body and would make the code a bit more readable and easy to modify!

Is there a tutorial going around for this or something? Saw another post along same lines. &amp;#x200B; Actually interested myself if there is; looks fun to play with.
Just use this https://toolz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html
I'd avoid regex unless really necessary. `return all(ch.isnumeric() for ch in input_str)`
Very cool!
&gt;And regarding the numpy vectors, should I make different numpy arrays for forces, masses, positions etc? eg : forces\[0\], masses\[0\], etc would give me the force and mass of the first body? Exactly. Instead of doing for body in bodies: x_diff = body.x - reference_x y_diff = body.y - reference_y hypotenuse = math.sqrt(((x_diff) ** 2 + (y_diff) ** 2)) f = G * m_a * m_b / hypotenuse ** 2 if all vectors are NumPy arrays (`type(pos_x) == type(pos_y) == type(m) == numpy.ndarray`), then you can do x_diff = pos_x - reference_x y_diff = pos_y - reference_y hypotenuse = numpy.sqrt(x_diff**2 + y_diff**2) f = G * m * reference_m / hypotenuse**2 This means that the loop will be done efficiently by NumPy instead of slowly in Python iterations. It's, of course, a much larger benefit when you do it for nested loops, but that requires a bit of mental gymnastics to figure it out. &gt; I just thought that the object oriented approach would properly encapsulate all the properties of a body and would make the code a bit more readable and easy to modify! That is a totally reasonable approach. The problem is that having the most elegant code does not always lead to the most efficient computations.
[Inefficient anagram detection](https://github.com/ubernostrum/interviewer-hell/blob/master/anagrams/primes.py) is something of a specialty of mine.
Nice! Some time ago I made [this python library](https://github.com/Zulko/pompei) to make mosaics using exclusively the frames of a given movie.

That's really cool.
Looking again i noticed it's 100% incorrect, as it checks only first string against second, but doesn't check second against first. So something like ("asdaasda", "asdawelp") would pass
1. /r/learnpython 2. Is `req.rfile` the file that's uploaded by the user? My guess is that it is, in fact, taking that long to upload.
It's fine as an idea, but I really don't like implementation. It either needs a default value at the end, or no defaults at all. In case there is no 'baz' in foo\['bar'\] you would get absolutely useless message, that "{} does not have a 'val' key", that has nothing to do with the actual problem in data.

I've seen very good GoDot tutorials on YouTube, made by someone from the devs (I think). Sorry, I can't provide a link. It was some time ago. Just search for "godot" there and you should find it in no time. However, you don't need 3D/2D engine for a text-based game. Use plain, old stdout or spice it up a bit with (n)curses or urwid. When you accomplish that, then think about putting an extra dimension and graphical splendor to it. I would stick to text mode, though. If you want additional challenge, make your game multiplayer (local, via SSH to the same machine) like good, old MUDs were.

Hi, &amp;#x200B; I've made a pretty similar project for my work, every morning one of the IT guy in my team take 2hours reading logs and making stupid monkey task as verifyng dumps execution etc... then write the result in a book for tracability. I've automated somes of these checks and stored eveything in a pgsql DB instead of the good old book. &amp;#x200B; Here's how i've done it for the data soring part and the user GUI: &amp;#x200B; For data storing in python I tend to use a pgsql db server and use flask as an API interface between the GUI and the DB. For the GUI I usually make it in VUE.js. &amp;#x200B; Trying to make it short : The VUE.js front end send my user's query to flask via gunicorn. Flask transform the user input to a sql query and send it to pgsql db Pgsql db return the resultset to flask. flask return the resultset to VUE.js frontend. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; I'm sure there's better ways for doing it but it's pretty functionnal.
The file is sent via http from another machine. And i have logged the rfile time on the server that processes the request.
Because it's a nice pattern that I enjoy using. For python 2 I'd not been keen on this approach but with python 3's typehints it seems more usable.
So your file is uploading slowly. Are you sure it's not just a bandwidth limitation?
Thanks for sharing. And one more question: I is a name of your flash drive, right? Do you use it on other computers or only on one? I mean, when used on another, the drive can get be named with another letter. And how can it be tackled?
Replace I with %~dp0 ... This gives u the full path to the bat file folder so if you put the bat in the root/parent directory of your thumb drive and have the programs in a subfolder you shouldn't have a issue.
&gt;upd: i ran the image check from the instance, the image was already on the instance, and it took 900 ms for the 4.5 mb image Im not sure. &amp;#x200B; upd: i ran the image check from the instance, the image was already on the instance, and it took 900 ms for the 4.5 mb image &amp;#x200B; But still that was a request that i made on the instance to 0.0.0.0:8000
What web framework are you using and how are you deploying it?
i have written a server using SimpleHTTPRequestHandler. It runs on pm2.
That's definitely part of the problem then. `http.server` is _incredibly_ slow. Use a proper framework like Flask or even an async one like Quart, Starlette or aiohttp, and deploy it with a good server (gunicorn, uvicorn, etc) and a reverse proxy (Nginx).
ok, thanks, i will look into it
Thanks! Mu does indeed sound like a good idea; I will try out Mu and Atom myself, and see what I think we should be using. As for PyGame Zero versus PyGame, I think she is big enough to try the real thing, and to see some real code. After all, her latest Scratch project went amok in if-blocks and distance calculations as she wanted the computer to play intelligently. Luckily, she had just learned about square roots in school, but I had to teach her about Pythagoras. :)
Still seems to me like a solution looking for a problem. But *de gustibus*...
Hmm, I'll try one more editor tonight :) &amp;#x200B; As for something more useful: That will undoubtedly come soon. Right now games is fun, and she wants to start by reimplementing a Scratch game. But I can totally see her using Python in a school project soon.
If you used images of a single stitch...
Dude, that is great!
Thank you! That's really nice of you. I guess I would say that asking (a lot of) questions really helped me with learning and working on real projects (like this one) will generate problems and problems are unanswered questions. But I'm not a professional by any means.
Thanks! I’ll check them out
Thank you suggesting an alternate solution. But the core idea is not to utilize built-in functions or library and giving it a more logic-based approach, so that it can be language-friendly and not end up being another repository of "Python Tips and Tricks". Thank you for taking the time to go through the programs.
I appreciate the effort made in collecting these, and they do serve as a great prompt to try solve some problems. However, having looked at a few examples, these should definitely not be used as best practice solutions!
For most of the problems, I have added the descriptions and problem statements. Rest of them are pretty intuitive by the code itself. But if you feel stuck, kindly mention the links here or feel free to raise a pull request. I will immediately rectify them. Thanks
Well done, very impressive! I’m struggling to get OpenCV on my RPi, let alone do anything like this!
Thank you for taking the time to go through this repository and suggesting corrections. I have made a fix to the anagram program. as LightofUriel and UrielAtWork mentioned that the program was not taking all cases into account.
Omg this was literally the project idea I had, when I started learning CV, great job!!
Thank you for the feedback. The repository is still in works. Much appreciated if you can raise a pull request suggesting fixes to the solution. The core idea is not to utilize built-in functions or library and giving it a more logic-based approach, so that it can be language-friendly and not end up being another repository of "Python Tips and Tricks" .
If those dicts are nested, how is this different to `foo[bar][bas][bob][bom] = “blah”`?
Wow
 `The core idea is not to utilize built-in functions or library and giving it a more logic-based approach, so that it can be language-friendly and not end up being another repository of "Python Tips and Tricks" .` This is fair enough, and lends some explanation to why you’ve taken the approaches you have for certain problems. But in this case I’d highly recommending adding a note in your README about this, so that it’s clear. Otherwise you’re hiding the purpose (and value!) of doing this.
Wow, keep on the good stuff.
Holy hell dude that's awesome! I'm definitely taking this as some inspiration!

It’s something people use in stat mech simulations a lot to simulate infinite sized systems. It’s like mirroring the box, so if the box is L long, if a particle moves to L+1 you move it to 1. It’s a little more complicated to measure distances because you have to find the shortest distance, either across the box or through the boundary, but I think it’d look cool for your simulation. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_boundary_conditions
**Periodic boundary conditions** Periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) are a set of boundary conditions which are often chosen for approximating a large (infinite) system by using a small part called a unit cell. PBCs are often used in computer simulations and mathematical models. The topology of two-dimensional PBC is equal to that of a world map of some video games; the geometry of the unit cell satisfies perfect two-dimensional tiling, and when an object passes through one side of the unit cell, it re-appears on the opposite side with the same velocity. In topological terms, the space made by two-dimensional PBCs can be thought of as being mapped onto a torus (compactification). *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
 Interesting but where I work 99% would not be able to leverage python directly and integrate this into their workflow in any way. The learning curve would be too steep. In my opinion you need to find the few individuals who may already know something about coding to build some tools to automate boring processes that the rest use. And whatever tools you create will have to be near invisible to them.
Hello - Cool code. I read through it and looks interesting, but can't get to execute locally. When I run via python3 (after install dependencies) it just shows a blank screen. I put some logging in and it's def'n calling screen.blit() in the event loop, but just nothing is being rendered to the screen. &amp;#x200B; Any help?
Better asked in /r/learnpython.
With pyqt5 you learn pyqt. With pysimplegui you don't learn anything you can put on your cv.
read the turtle api the turtles moves as directions typed and then loops through the 6 color choices creating a rainbow color
This problem is already solved by many other providers, and they don't spam on reddit. I'll continue using them for this reason. Also it's A LOT more expensive than other providers. No. Thanks.
BTW, you can write `d['alma','bertha','carol']` without brackets
What is x?
what is being iterated in the for loop 0 through 360 not trying to be condenscending but from this question im assuming u r a beginner i would recommend watching python video youtube derek banas
Yeah im a complete begginner, just saw this code and found it a bit interesting
Post some exemples!
&gt;PySimpleGUI vs PyQt5 Posting it there, thanks for letting me know
That looks amazing. Congratulations!
It's one of those projects that doesn't seem too hard (not too easy neither) but have a huge Wow effect. Great work, and great results. Thanks for sharing!
Nice!
Is this your homework? Anyway, take this hint: Use a dictionary instead of a list to store your results.
Wow, it's amazing
&gt; keys() and values() thanks
&gt; Both methods returns an iterable, that is practical
&gt; /r/learnpython thanks joined.
Keep in mind that PicStitch is already the name of a popular app https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bigblueclip.picstitch
That's mesmerizing man
Head on over to /r/roguelikedev/
No, not homework lol Im self teaching.. Im trying to analyze large lists of strings based on string length. I guess I can see where your pointing.. I could set the length recorded for any paticular string as a key, and than... if other strings match that key, you could set a counter that appends every time it gets a hit on that keys string length...
That's somewhat why I made the switch, the company didn't have Access and I figured it'd be a useful experience down the road. I was trying to keep track of something in Excel and format parts of it using VBA to print. It was much easier and inherently more customizable to use python and pyqt with a sql flavor to manage that data and output it.

Can I add it to my portfolio? Just kidding hope you keep winning at programming and get jobs
Why not use the officially supported python for qt bindings (formerly known as pyside2)? They are better in every way.
Exactly. You just described a good solution. Dictionaries, lists, tuples and sets are good for different things. Always try to think about what data structure best fits your problem. If none fits your problem, don't be jump into oop and make a class.
wow, great!!!
I was completely unaware of this problem. Now I have this to keep me up at might too.
I have a question. Why?
The problem with some people is that they don't understand that the fact you can do something doesn't mean that you should.
What are SIMD operations?
&gt; the nightmare of python 2 to 3 breaking things. The only nightmare is if you have shitty coders, and if you have shitty coders you should fire them and hire decent ones.
I would recommend you look at xlwings. I have found it to be excellent for what you are looking to do.
 If it wasn't mentioned already, one thing to look into is physics fixed-timesteps, while letting FPS go as high as you want. Since acceleration is involved, you'll notice instability faster. This happens mainly when you are not using small enough timesteps. Why? Right now the two are linked. One render call per one physics update call. FPS going higher, or lower, will change how fast stuff moves. You can lock your physics timestep to be 60 times a second, then let drawing go as fast as possible. Here's a good intro: https://dewitters.com/dewitters-gameloop/ And check out https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/BramStolk/20160408/269988/Fixing_your_time_step_the_easy_way_with_the_golden_48537_ms.php
You could have a look at pyimgui. Immediate mode gui has a much simpler model than traditional guis like Qt, Gtk etc
don't use lxml for html docs. use beautifulsoup. It's more robust.
 def max_sum(num_list): num_dict = {} for x in num_list: num_dict[x] = [] for y in num_list: if not has_common_digits(x, y): num_dict[x].append(y) sum_list = [] for key, nums in num_dict.items(): sum_list.append(sum(nums) + key) return max(sum_list) def has_common_digits(num1, num2): for n in str(num1): if n in str(num2): return True return False

Thanks and good luck! You're welcome to send me any ones you've created
Ermmm this is not correct solution. This adds all the numbers that can go with initial number, but does not check if those other numbers go with themselves or not, For example if list is 99, 23, 33, this algorithm with return 99 + sum of number that can go with it viz 23 and 33, but actually 23 and 33 can nit be together as they have 3 in common. Keep going! Nice start.
Try both. These are fun little projects you're talking about making. They have different approaches. PySimpleGUI is great at knocking out a GUI for a personal tool for example. "Learning it" will take you an afternoon. Do something with it first. Then turn to pyside2 or PyQt5 and try perhaps the same little project. Add difficulty as you go.
Thank you! I plan on it
impressive!
