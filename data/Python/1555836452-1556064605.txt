Developers are humans. Humans do not read warnings or documentation. Time and time again developers without context, who see configurations like this, are prone to picking insane values that seem to make the system work best to them. What you *want* to do does not necessarily have any bearing on what you **should** do. Great damage has been done over and over and over again because developers made bad decisions like this, or didn't understand the decisions they were making, for production applications, or libraries that end up in others' production applications. I can tell you are upset that this API just doesn't accept what you see as a valid value, but in reality security primitives and their safe configurations are extremely serious business. What you're doing is the equivalent of jamming a solid copper plug into a circuit breaker box, or clamping open the safety override on a large and powerful machine -- and equally dangerous, *in real world terms*. Even if you have all the context now and are experimenting with full knowledge of how bad it is, you will probably end up with an apparently-working program... one which can be freely copied and may end up in less careful hands, guarding the privacy of someone's users or the integrity of someone's systems. Unless you are plastering ⚠️☢️**DO NOT USE THIS**☢️⚠️ warnings all over the result, anyone you show it to might be at risk. Computers and computer systems are more remarkable and easier to build on every day; there is every reason to believe that someone could use such a thing in an otherwise fully functional system without ever knowing how it works or why it is dangerous. Ruby is extremely wild-west in general philosophically, and the only good seems to be making sure that devs can do literally anything as many ways as possible with no regard for what is a good idea or not, so I'm not surprised that all they do is put a note in the docs. So, yes, maybe what you are trying to do right now is easier to do in ruby. But you are severely missing the mark here, and not in a pretty way, taking out your frustration by accusing the "python community" of being rude, elitist, or treating you like an idiot. I would rather be manhandled by warnings and restrictions in crypto configuration every day of the week than accidentally make an insecure application because I misread something or missed a note in the docstring.

I had hoped someone would recognize this... It's something Raymond Hettinger would say. In some of his talks, he asks people to clap if they think he made the module/function/change he's talking about. Now, I don't know if Raymond actually worked on `collections` at all, but hey. TL;DR: inside joke apparently nobody understood.
I have used conda before but not exactly for creatings virtualenvs. I can only say that pipenv is a godsend when using many versions of Python. You don’t have to worry about all the dependencies in a giant ‘venv’ folder etc. You have a lock file and that’s it. Also very simple commands etc. Would recommend it.

Never mind. After seeing [your other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/bfmj63/thank_you_ruby/eleut6h/), your apologies ring hollow and meaningless as you've already doubled down on your insults. Never mind that there are already direct bindings to openssl in python, as well...

What are your suggestions for videos?
What do you suggest for a video?
Don't make them for simple simple things that could be absorbed in five seconds as text
how did you start learning? I mean learning machine learning
If you are serious about this, try to make videos involving medium to high complexity projects. The internet is filled with random youtubers trying to teach python by just copy pasting samples from popular libraries.

[import antigravity](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python.png) I'd be far more interested in a video which showed how to make a daemon which listened for custom events, like new episodes of something being released, and made notifications. This video is just a waste of 4 minutes at the moment.
Beautiful Soup, which I use frequently for scraping websites. It's what got me started using Python in the first place.
@Ashutoshkv, I see you are the #1 post on /r/python today, and the majority of comments are negative. Well, that's the internet. Here are my recommendations: - First, great video. The reality is videos are becoming a primary learning channel, and have impact that a web page listing the solution will never have (even though the video has less information). - Keep making videos. - Always put a key in the video description so someone can skip to the good stuff. Finally, you did something I like: No bull in the beginning of the video nagging people to subscribe / go to your Patreon and all that nonsense.
You get more information from the [library's homepage](https://pypi.org/project/win10toast/). This is the single worst example I've seen of the "X in n lines of code" format post.
Can only agree. Ppl spending more time on complaining than thinking. The headline already told that it’ll be 3 lines. Let OP start with simple things and grow. If you know it better just don’t look and move on.
Sry, I really don't know what to do next that may make sense. Reinstalling twisted and python's OpenSSL won't do anything I suppose, maybe try purge that deluge version and try with more recent or older version.
May I ask why you created Names, instead of just doing len(likes)?

Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**.

&gt;Flask Sync framework for chat? Really?
Sure. I work for a relatively small company- 10-15 people, depending on how we've staffed up for a project. Most of my co-workers are architects, fabricators, and designers. There's one other developer who's also the electronics guy- we use a lot of custom electronics. Most of our work is large, corporate clients, who are looking for some sort of "wow" experience for their space. Like, our last big project was several room-filling installations for a large company's marketing team (they'd bring in corporate clients and wow them with the space). We're working on some kind of interactive sculpture for a hospital. I do most of the software, and our preferred stack is Python. Since a lot of our systems are activated with LEDs, a lot of the software I write is about finding ways to create cool animations for that sculpture. But it's also very much a "we need to do X" situation- "we're building fake redwood trees, and we need the branches to sway in the breeze, and that needs to be controllable". So suddenly I'm writing some motor control firmware for Ardunios, with a network layer in Python (because of course the trees are on the network, aren't yours?). Then, "hey, we're building this hallway with LEDs down it, and we want to time the animation to people walking down the corridor using motion sensors." This has spilled over to life outside of work- I have a friend who does immersive theater, and I'm currently working on making a painting which purrs for her to use in a production.
&gt; What do you suggest for a video? Skip making it and write a blog entry instead.
Will 'Object detection with OpenCV + Controlling Chrome Dino with hand gestures 'on next Sunday be enough?
This is a very nice looking and clear tutorial
You are very kind! Thanks! I will never put out beginner things! Even if I put a 'Don't watch it!' people will still watch it and complain! I have found hundreds of tutorials which are very awful but still have comments like 'Great Video!' Thanks for your reply! Your reply gives me a lot of relief!
Sounds good. Few pointers - 1. It really doesn't matter where you code as long as you are comfortable with it, but online tutorials require a certain bit of presentation to pull it off. So I suggest, you use any of the popular editors - vs code , sublime , atom , Pycharm etc. This is not needed from content pov but then again it's the internet. Whatever looks good will sell good. 2. Stick to a script. Do not code on the go. Prepare your material beforehand. Clean the code. Test it and keep it aside. When you are recording, do not do it from scratch. Better keep a second monitor with the code already laid out ( not in display though) so that you can refer it while typing out. This will make your video more engaging. There will be fewer - 'ermm , okaayy, soo , and.. ' fillers. Keep your videos convince and brief. 3. optional point. Try to include some animations especially between sections . You can see how famous youtubers and other online tutorials like Udemy, Coursera etc so it. Minimal animations go a long way to engage the user. 4. Try to work on your accent. You don't need to go take a fancy diction class online to fix it. Just be conscious of it and try to pace it well. Being a fellow Indian myself, I can tell you how many times I have come across YouTubers from India who have brilliant content but are just not able to put it across because the way they pronounce. This is not a jibe at you so don't take it personally. There are few good indian instructors online who have made it internationally. You can see their videos to get an idea of what I'm talking. 5. Most importantly, content is king. Give priority to content always. Don't end up making short 4 min videos of stuff which can be easily googled. Try to creating engaging material. Only then you can expect your channel to grow. Best regards.
Why are downvoting the man? He is asking to improve the content to benefit the people
Okay! Thanks! You are very kind! Do you think I should delete the video?
Keep it. It's not too bad either. Besides it'll remind you what not to do in the future.
Speaking of toast, anyone ever found the virus on Rollercoaster tycoon on the CD? It was named, Roallertoaster.exe ;)
The quality of these videos posted in here are getting worse! Next up, how to OPEN THE COMMAND LINE FOR WINDOWS. Next week, LINUX COMMAND LINE!
I appreciate this link more than the video itself. I don't wanna do the same exact thing that Python is often bashed for. &amp;#x200B; import module module.do_complicated_thing() Thanks man.
Please explain.
Requires pywin32 though, which can be somewhat invasive in terms of installation and doesn't typically play well with virtual environments if you do a full install.
Using git &gt; your reminder.
You should align your Y axis : first one begin at 0, second one at 1.
I just made an opencv project with plays the chrome dino games controlled by hand gestures! Gonna make a video on the project next Sunday!
I use pandas mainly. What is Django and how is it used? for websites?
Django is a python-based web framework. Projects built with Django follow the model-view-template pattern. I commonly see it used for developing REST APIs and PostgreSQL database management but it is most known for use in websites. Instagram, Pinterest and Mozilla all use Django for their websites according to [the Django foundation's site](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/overview/).
Tte tools to win are the tools you build. Anybody talking about how one language is better or worse than another is full of shit. Build something amazing and then ask them to show you what they made
Yes, like this: https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-make-windows-10-toast-notifications-with-python-fb3c27ae45b9
Just tell them to eat a dick. It's a pointless argument that will never be resolved.
This is obviously correct and I was not trying to say they hate python I don't think their jokes have any malice behind them haha.
What was the problematic line (or lines) of code? Generally Python string methods will take OS-specific differences into account for you. For example `str.splitlines()` should work the same way on Windows and Unix systems. If you need to match line-endings literally you could use `os.linesep` for portable code.
I've been interested in seeing how someone might build something like this. Really cool, thanks for sharing!!
https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
Just whip out your monster condom that you use for your magnum dong.
Not really the response I was expecting but I will keep that in mind haha
languages are tools. that being said every tool has a specific purpose that makes that tool viable. python wouldnt exist if it were inferior or obsolete. i feel like youre catching hell just because youre not king shit yet. take a few courses on [sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com) and get some more languages under your belt. or get something that injects code like a usb rubber ducky and show them what python can do in the right hands. god speed sir
well played
Their knowledge is inferior as they stuck in that mud for the rest of their lives. Tell me, they bought Windows Phones at that time, didn't they?
ask them why python is the most popular programming language? if they say because it's easy tell them they are being snobby assholes
Thank you!
Just agree with them. Then years down the line when you're making more than them with Python, laugh at them back.
Google, Instagram, Yelp, Uber, Spotify, Dropbox, Reddit... ask if they use any of those services and remind them they're all built in Python.
Having been a C# developer for years before I discovered Python and open source, I can say from experience they are both great languages and ecosystems. C# wins on some things (speed of execution, etc.), Python wins on some things (speed of development, ease of reading other people’s code, etc). I could go on about them both, but the truth is no one wins by fighting about it. You win by shutting it down as a technical debate and telling them that it’s great that they love their language of choice, and you are very happy with yours. Our field needs more passionate people that see the merits of other ecosystems. MS has finally come around to this way of thinking too with .NET core. So encourage them to be more like the company they worship and be open to other ideas outside their bubble.
Oh damn, looks like I got tangled up in the terminology. Thanks!
https://xkcd.com/353/ (but don't mention https://xkcd.com/1987/)
All the films you see have got an extremely heavy amount of python behind them, you'd be completely useless if you tried to use anything but python/c++.
Spotify too? Nice!
Is this for real? I know a lot of C# and .NET nerds and most of them love Python. In fact anyone I've met who have programmed in real world avoid getting into flame wars and will never berate others for choosing languages they don't like. It is even hard to believe that one's own family does that. Can you give some actual examples of those "too many jokes" that your family of ".NET nerds" makes for "choosing an "inferior language""?
Eh, this isn't a great argument. Just because something is popular doesn't make it good. And the fact is a large part of Python's popularity and success is because it is "easy". The barrier to entry is extremely low and newcomers can become productive in it very quickly. This is a good thing, and there's nothing snobbish about pointing it out. That's not to say that being a Python programmer makes someone a novice, or not a REAL PROGRAMMER, but Python is the leading choice for novice programmers. And I do think that knowing ONLY Python puts you in danger of becoming a perpetual novice. I've been programming professionally in Python for over a decade alongside other languages (heavily C and C++). I have a love/hate relationship with it. There are things Python does exceedingly well, but there areas where it is (or was) utter shit. (I do think Python is largely "good" btw)
Pinterest, Uber, Zoom Video and Lyft just did huge IPOs. Tell your family to look at the job ads ...
I don't know how it fixed it, but I put in a bigger SD card and just imaged it from the old SD card. Then I updated cffi and cryptography.
They generally poke fun at the dynamic typing of the language and how C# is in general faster at execution. They don't mind the language I don't think, but it's just more of playful teasing since I am the only dev in the family to work in a none Microsoft language. I am not trying to bash my family haha
I think 3Blue1Brown's video got me started, then I spent some time playing with the scikit-learn library. Once you start to feel comfortable with the concept (and if you feel comfortable with linear algebra) , watching a tutorial or building it yourself is doable! 3B1Br: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk) Here's an in depth tutorial series: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGxgnH8y2NM&amp;list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfKTOs3Keq\_kaG2P55YRn5v](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGxgnH8y2NM&amp;list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfKTOs3Keq_kaG2P55YRn5v)
Well, go ahead and re invent the wheel like what facebook did to Myspace and make it better!
Improvement is a strong word.
Maybe sometimes it’s right and safe to have a condom stapled to your penis, but this is the time when I absolutely _have to_ make babies 😏 And if cutting a hole in a condom is impossible, or just waaaaay too hard, I need to be told that, not that unprotected sex is unsafe. Do you see where I am going here?
Finally ended up trying to do the smallest rps possible (that is being pep8-friendly), this is what I ended up with. import random CHOICES = {'rock': 'scissors', 'paper': 'rock', 'scissors': 'paper'} SCORES = {"user": 0, "comp": 0, 'draw': 0} while not any(a == 3 for a in SCORES.values()): user = input("Enter rock, paper or scissors: ") SCORES[{True: "user", False: "comp"}.get( CHOICES.get(user) == random.choice(list(CHOICES.keys())), 'draw')] += 1 print(f'U:{SCORES["user"]}. C: {SCORES["comp"]}, D: {SCORES["draw"]}')
Yeah I wouldn't be bothered by those. Anybody with any sort of programming experience knows that statically and dynamically typed languages have their pros/cons and specific use cases and speed depends mostly on the implementation not on the language. Also if I were you I'd take "only dev in the family to work in a non-Microsoft language" as a complement. In fact you can make that non-Microsoft everything.
The best argument is to not argue. Even agree with them. Recognise pythons weaknesses, such as execution speed, but also learn about where it excels, such as with the clean expressive syntax and the ability to be productive very quickly in it. One day, you'll have learnt enough to pour scorn on them when they have an entire file with 50+ lines of boilerplate for what is in essence something very simple, which is something you can do in a handful of lines!
Now that I see it published, any invalid value would be counted as a draw. But that's an acceptable bug for this version. Adding a while bucle like in my previous comment would suffice to fix it, but it would a two whole lines!
It's async with eventlet and socketio, but even a single-threaded synchronous app can do real-time chat if you wanted to.
Yep. And a nails can be screwed in... weak argument.
Haha :D
Yes, it is totally doable.. I've started learning python as a new years resolution and been at it for 4 months. Python itself and Tkinter GUI are quite powerful tools but are also quite approachable for simple designs. I've been making simple apps after about a month of study and some vigorous research..
What I'm saying is, this is not synchronous as you seem to think...
And what I'm saying there is no reason to use synchronous framework for asynchronous tasks.
This: https://thorstenball.com/blog/2019/04/09/learn-more-programming-languages/ Still, JavaScript sucks :D

The only way to win is not to play. Arguing which language or technology is "better" is neckbeard bullshit. It's like a snot eating contest - you really think winning that is some kind of accomplishment?
Not really, we just have conversations and tease each other. But yeah that seems to be the consensus of this thread.
And no one argued that it is...
You should be able to do something like finaldb[&lt;col name&gt;].map(lambda x: int(x[0]))
First of all please use parametric queries. Sql injection hacks are completely preventable if proper precautions are taken and this is one of them. in sqlite it would be c.execute('select * from whatever where thing=?', x) What's your issue with query generation? If you are trying to convert betweeen a class hierarchy and a flat 2d sql database, use an ORM. A popular one for Python is Sqlalchemy. If not, what are needing to do? ETL?
All i know is that the python keeps its food safe from editing inside of tuple-ware.
The immutable and mutable story can be relevant :xD
It‘s for cryptos.
read the sidebar.
This looks fantastic thanks for posting.
I’m working through Learn Python the Hard Way. Each exercise is pretty quick to get through - I’d say 5 to 15 mins. I’m only half way through, but have learned a lot. I also watch YT videos when I want to get a more in-depth understanding of something.
I use Sqlalchemy... Both the expression language and the ORM, depending. Highly recommended.
\+ 1 for [SqlAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org). It's API can be a bit profuse so I'd recommend starting with [tutorials](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/library.html#tutorials). One important thing about it is that there are two libraries merged in one. A query generator is SqlAlchemy Core and object mapper is SqlAlchemy ORM. They come together, but you can use Core without using ORM if you like. I guess you'll need a separate library to connect SqlAlchemy and Athena; quick googling shows there are some options, though I don't know anything about how good they are.
Wanted to know where you learnt ML as well as the video editing stuff, given your age!
You might be surprised to learn that Microsoft are the 22nd biggest contributor to Python, in terms of code. They contribute more than RedHat, Dropbox, or ActiveState. The script I used to get these stats is at https://github.com/jamespic/check_companies
Thanks for sharing. What are your plans for the project? Do you have any other projects that you are working on?
How that side spells coding is very bothersome to me.

I am net new to python and hoping to pursue the following as my first project: I have a set of floor plan drawings (black and white images with intersecting lines) and I would like to utilize python to 1) apply a 100 x 100 x/y axis to the image 2) define intersection points of the black lines 3) return the x/y coordinates of each intersection and 4) return an image with the points plotted on the image. &amp;#x200B; I have no clue where to start and would truly appreciate some direction!! Any help much appreciated :)
Yup good point... just added that it's intended for Python3.
Thanks for the reply! I can already connect to Athena without any problems. As long as SqlAcademy can just create a string then that'll be all I need. I'll look into that!
Working on ETLs mostly.
Sounds great! How does this compare to Rocket.Chat?
I'm guessing the for loops arent nested. That would be why. When you post code snippets especially in python, make sure you format it correctly since python is based on indentation.
What’s your recommendation then?
Current plans are mostly maintenance and requested features to support our current projects. Some other python projects I'm working on recently are these two: * [https://github.com/thenetcircle/logistik](https://github.com/thenetcircle/logistik) * [https://github.com/thenetcircle/coop-labler](https://github.com/thenetcircle/coop-labler) The first one grew out of a need for me to manage ML models in production somehow (we run most things in our own DS so can't take advantage much of cloud services). At the time I hadn't found any similar tool we could use, but since then tf-serving has been released, which solves part of the problems (RESTifying a model), and some other not-so-generic ones for handing event consumption/retries/distribution/etc. Might be something available today that I've missed, but this serves our needs really well. The second one I started with recently because we're doing a lot of object detection using deep learning lately, and plan to do more, and drawing boxes around thousand of images to get a training set takes a long time, and current tooling I've found either requires subscription based SaaS, or single-user tool that needs to be downloaded and installed... So the goal of this one is to just have a web interface that allocates batches for anyone in our company to label. If it's this simple, it's much easier to get help from e.g. our support team or PMs.
That was one of the alternatives we looked into a lot before deciding. I don't remember the exact reasons for it, but likely it had something to do with not supporting the features we needed. It's a really good project though, and if we had to do it again today it might be better to use RocketChat.
You're not supposed to share your steam api key, as stated here: [https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apiterms](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apiterms) &gt;You agree to keep your Steam Web API key confidential, and not to share it with any third party. This license is personal to you and specific to your Application. You agree that you will be personally responsible for the use of your Steam Web API key. &amp;#x200B; You could instead build your own service with something like Flask and let your application query your own api. This way you won't expose your key.
First of all, not my API key, found it on web. Secondly, I don't think Valve gives a shit about this. Thanks for pointing out though! :D
Agreed. Like many tools that embrace generality, it is very powerful, but not always easy to use since oftentimes there are multiple ways to achieve the same goal. For the OPs purposes, probably focusing on Core would be best, ignoring ORM.
hey [r/erok0081](https://www.reddit.com/r/erok0081), this is great feedback! we left this course pretty short mainly because this is the first hardware course and we don't really know how many learners will take it. it's very possible that we add more content to it in the future. also, can you give one or two examples of the parens and capital letters conflicts? i'd love to fix those up asap.
Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!
Congrats for successfull project! Couple of questions. 1. Why did you choose to write your own solution instead of use existing ones? 1. How does it compare to already existing OSS chat solutions? 1. Does it provide interoperability between other chat protocols, like XMPP or Matrix? Do you plan to implement those?
I learned both of these on YouTube and Udemy. As for video graphics, I also tried imitate other YouTube channels, such as Kurzgesagt and Crash Course.
Thats what I was saying. I would *not* suggest people installing packages to their system install of Python, but rather to a virtual environment. I wasn't talking about the difference between `pip` and `pip3`, just the virtual environment.
great work! when I started with Flask, I had a really hard time piecing together a good idea of what it actually was, let alone applying it. I look forward to going through this in more depth when I upgrade my app!
We have quite a few requirements to suit our product needs, and that weighed heaviest on the decision to roll our own. I was the one who did the evaluation of alternatives as well, but it was a couple of years ago so I don't remember exactly why I believed it was worth spending time on doing it ourselves. I remember RocketChat was one alternative. I believe one reason was that few of the alternatives had independent server/client software, and our front-end team needed to be able to implement their own client software without too much effort. Another reason to roll our own was because we wanted to have a single system that could do one-to-one chats, group chats, and delivery real-time notifications similar to Facebook notifications (we develop social network). Compared to existing solutions it's similar to RocketChat and MatterMost (plus matrix/riot if you don't consider their super cool architecture, just client side features). As for interoperability with other protocols, it doesn't exist really. We never had a need for it so it didn't make sense for me to spend time on that, heh. But if that is needed, Matrix is probably a better choice; this project is a bit more specialized to just deliver real-time events to groups/individuals and let the front-end decide how the API is used.

Thank you! Let me know if you have any issues, so I may update the post.
Gotcha :)
You could optimize that Dockerfile a little
Yeah, relic of the past... We're not using docker anymore for this, but it would be easier to manage/scale using docker.
It's neither impossible nor very hard; you just lack an understanding of what you are doing or what kind of tool you are looking for, then taking it out on whoever else you perceive to be at fault. It's been many hours since I first saw your benighted post and I still can't think of a single justifiable reason for doing what you're trying to do. Maybe as an explicit example of an insecure system... but you explicitly talked about needing to make it faster, so all I can do is hope it never sees the light of day.
Thank you!
The protocol utilizes a multitude of encryption algorithms. Even if you break the RSA part (and RSA-encrypted message only gets sent *once* in the whole session, transmitting encrypted data that has nothing to do with actual key) there are still other things to break. Please don’t tell me it isn’t secure, help me solve a problem. If you say it’s doable - explain yourself, I tried multiple things. Sometimes it’s worth shooting through your shoulder to get someone holding a knife to your neck. Like in that Bruce Willis movie. I hope my metaphors aren’t too much lol. Also, look at different variants of RSA, there are ways to do interesting things with those primes.

Reading your traceback is like getting hit by "To be continued" in some space soap opera...
Is this an existing protocol you need to interface with, or a new one you are creating? In the first case you can probably use something like pyopenssl, which has direct bindings to the openssl library and so should be able to do everything it can. I'm not overly familiar with the proliferation of lower-level implementations like this, but I'm sure there are others that will let you create and manipulate extremely low level primitives in this way. In the second case, you can still do the above, but I can't honestly say it sounds like a good idea. The "many layers of individually bad encryption" approach might sound good at first but in the end it only adds opportunities to make mistakes without adding any safety of substance. For example, encrypting 10 different bad ways takes \~10x as much work as encrypting in 1 bad way, and takes 10x as long to break. But encrypting in that same way with quadruple the key length might also take 10x the work, but be so much more secure that it's impractical to ever attack. Sorry I can't offer you specific examples if that's what you have really needed. I am doing my best to offer you actual useful guidance here, not assuming you're an idiot. The same can be said for the people who built this key-size restriction into the first library you tried. People make uninformed idiotic mistakes all the time, myself among them, and helping others to avoid those mistakes is not a bad thing.
There's no cons , to o many pros to list .. be more specific 😉
Hi, numpy and matplotlib can build a triangular mesh of your x- and y-data, which you can then use to interpolate between the points. Look at https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.triplot.html
pyOpenSSL, from the name of it, sounds like something I could use. I will look into it as soon as I get to work and keep you posted. I really am not an idiot, I just work with tiny IoT devices and proof of concept should be, for some reason, done in Python.
It means that you first inherit the class hierarchy of the leftmost class, followed by the entire hierarchy of the next class listed.
https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning/blob/master/src/mnist_loader.py
There is no real pros or cons to use a language over another. It's a matter of use case. For instance, If you work for a company where everybody does JS then use a node backend not a python one. Pros and cons, it's a matter of perspective
The link you found shows a more complex example than the one you posted. It shows an example where class D inherits from class B and C, and class B and C both inherit from class A. This is where the “depth first” comes in. Depth first means that if class B overwrites a method inherited from class A, the “deeper” method (from class B) takes precedence. Hope that explains it. There is a diagram in the link you found that might show it more clearly.
Nope, it actually means that a method won't be search in deeper levels of the left class before the same level of the right class.
please for the love of God tell me you are not creating new IoT devices with worthless encryption
I really like the way you explain things. Not too fast, so one can’t follow, but on point and without too much unnecessary talking. Will be looking into more videos!
Learn how to Google, it's my best coding trick.
&gt;I have build a program that scrapes data from multiple websites in parallel. You started with this, your knowledge isn't perfect (you don't use an editor with linter and so you can make something like this break after return statement), and that missing code is probably the key here.
I would like to know what append means/does in this example. Thanks!

It appends 4 given numbers to the list.
Thank you!
No. He asked about the wording in the article, which specifically applies to old-style classes in Python 2. "Depth first" means that it will search the entire hierarchy (the depth) of the left-most class first, followed by the right. And that's exactly what the example in the article demonstrates: ```$ python diamond1.py m of A called $ python3 diamond1.py m of C called ````
We all start somewhere. At least OP seems to be taking feedback well.
Best tip: Read the sidebar.
Yep, you're right. I thought that "depth-first, left to right" is an indivisible term and probably I missed it as being used to explain new style classes behavior instead of the old style.
Better asked in /r/learnpython.
My tip is to avoid "tricks". Another tip: ask questions in /r/learnpython.
I'd advise against using node everywhere, why write asynchronous code for sequencial operations, node has its place but Python can also handle async now very well.. python has a very quick learning curve, the libs are much more mature and don't fade out of fashion on a monthly basis... I could go on ..

An incrementing base 62 index is guaranteed to be unique. It is worth learning to understand the base 62 conversion they are doing. I'd expect a programmer to understand base 16 conversion, which isn't really any differen from any other number base.
How's the security?
So... this turns jupyter into excel?

Pycharm has nothing to do with your python install. You've likely not installed mnist, you can do that by running pip install python-mnist from a command line, or if you go to the interpreter section of PyCharm, you can pip install packages from there.

Strangely, the Learning Python book looks like this: https://imgur.com/VGYoG8v
 for counter in range(10): print([x[1] for x in perm_list]) Although this will print it as a list each time, so you may get square brackets around the output.
You can paste code here by starting lines with four spaces. That being said... what do you want to accomplish, what kind of data is in those vars, etc..
In which market? They may be right for certain domains, but python is hugely popular as a whole.
Off the top of my head, here are some really popular (and useful) shit written in Python: * Reddit - 'nuf said * Ansible - extremely popular server config management and automation tool. * OpenStack - OSS for running private and public cloud infrastructure. Used by the likes of PayPal, Rackspace, and CERN. * Django web framework - A really popular web framework that powers some really big sites like Instagram, Disqus, and Spotify * Flask micro framework - Flask has been a very popular micro framework from the start but has seen a massive surge in popularity as it's really popular for building microservices. * NumPy - an extremely important maths/science calculations library that's heavily relied upon in scientific academia as well as machine learning. * Pandas - an extremely popular data analysis library In fact, NumPy and Pandas is so useful they were used in the algorithm that generated the recent black hole picture. Yep, the algorithm used in the most important scientific discovery in recent history was written in Python.
Why bother with his nonsense? Seriously I don’t engage people that have crap running out of their mouth. Beyond that from his perspective he might be right. I’m certainly that there are many programmers visiting this Reddit that write code that never sees mass distribution. That is kinda the point of Python it is excellent for the quick and dirty that may ever see the light of day.
This sounds really cool :)
perm_list is a list of lists. it has over 4k list of lists inside of it. I was hoping to grab the second item of the first 10 lists. I accomplished that, but it looks super funky and I know I could be a better programmer if I figure out a simpler solution. I think the top comment has the best solution though if you have any other ideas on what might be better I'm all ears.
`print(x)` instead of `print(x[1])`. `x` will return each value in the list each iteration of the for loop.
I didn't know I could use a for statement inside of a print statement. That's an interesting tidbit. thanks for the input friend.
No problem. So the stuff inside the print statement is known a "list comprehension". It is extremely useful and you should do so reading about it. As a statement on it's own, list comprehensipn produces a list - which you are then printing. So it's the same as saying the following: myList = [x[1] for x in perm_list] # produces a list print(myList) Also, for future reference, this sub is for news and discussion about Python. If you want to ask questions to learn, better to ask in /r/learnpython.
Oh, didnt know that existed, sry
The `x % y` operator means to divide x by y and output the remainder. So 28**-1 is 0.035. And 0.035 divided by 571 is 0 with remainder .035, so you get .035 as a result.
28^-1 mod 571 is how I run the expression in Wolfram
[On wolfram using a power of -1 calculates the inverse mod](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/PowerMod.html), not the inverse and then the mod. Try `1/28 mod 571` in wolfram to get the result you would get in python.
Trying this in Wolfram Alpha, it looks like it interprets it as &gt; PowerMod[28, -1, 571] Which means to find X where (28 times X) mod 571 = 1. And this is 102 since `(102*28) % 571 = 1` To get the Python behavior, you can enter `Mod[28^-1, 571]`in Wolfram. Surprisingly, just adding the parenthesis in Wolfram doesn't seem to force it to evaluate the `28^-1` first.
Doesn't twitter detect this kind of automated actions as spam? also a video tutorial to setup would be neat. Thanks and good luck!
Is there any way to write it in Python to where my output would be the 102 and not the long decimal?
Check the [TIOBE index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) for statistics. Recently Python entered top-three positions for the first time ever, as of April 2019 it swapped third place with C++ but their ratings are still close to each other.

what you are looking for is called "mod inverse"
Use the mod_inverse function from sympy.
Easy in the sense that yes it's totally doable, but don't expect to be a coding master on day one. It'll take some time to get to grips with how everything works. Python is a great starting language as you can learn most of the coding ideas like object orientation etc with an easy to read /remember syntax. Plus there are tons of online tutorials around for helping with starting up with python :)
Sublime text and Dropbox both are built using Python. Almost all Google Products API support Python. Tell me Python is not popular again.
You might have to delete and recreate the venv
you mean that an active programer that has dozens of projets would have to do this and reinstall all the dependencies for each one ? what if some dependencie is not compatible with the new python version for some reason ?
Is there a screenshot how it looks? I searched for it in the docu but didn't find it.
Yes. That's why you use tools like Pipenv or Poetry that manage virtualenvs for you. If a dependency is not compatible with the new Python version, you need to stick to the old Python version or wait for the dependency to update - or update it yourself, if it's open source.
of course
Learning to code is like learning to use a toolbox. Yes, you can learn how to hammer a nail by yourself, but unless you're sharing the ins and outs with other people, or aiming to achieve a big project, you'll never know all the hidden tricks
Hi, thank you very much for your reply. Assuming I have created that mesh between the measured values, how would you interpolate now between those?
Should really have a separate feeding enclosure. One without substrate for feeding
I'm 26, half way through my master and I got a job as a Python dev. So I guess its a yeah
The basics of Python are really easy to learn. I always recommend Automate the boring stuff with Python. It's online for free.
&gt; you mean that an active programer that has dozens of projets would have to do this and reinstall all the dependencies for each one ? Such active programmer would likely not go around uninstalling the interpreter that the projects are relying upon. Install the new version alongside the old one.
i think the greatest difficulty when teaching yourself is finding a reason to code everyday. there are certain concepts that need to be ingrained so you don't have to think about them when solving the problem you really want to solve. that comes only with repetition, and after a while tutorials and exercises start to feel like you're not making any progress, so a clear goal or project can be helpful. programming is a new discipline so we aren't taught the basics early on in life. building an application from scratch is like wanting to engineer a car without having learned to add. there's a lot to do before you become productive, but it's doable an implicit difficulty is also finding enough time to dedicate to learning. assuming you're either in school or working, unless you've found a way to apply programming to what you're doing, you have to do it in your free time which can lead to burnout i would suggest easing yourself into it slowly. do some basic tutorials on how to solve problems and think like a programmer. let it sit for a while then come back, each time choosing more advanced topics. some people have the constitution and endurance to cram everything in and persevere. if you're one of those people, go for it. if not, just take it easy. you'll get there if you stick with it i hope this was helpful
Google, Spotify, and many more of that size aren't big enough?
yeah its totally doable, but i wouldn't suggest it. the problem is, that all the other programming languages have a completely different syntax, and moving from python to C++ or C# or Java (for example) will be really hard.. i suggest learning the basics of another language first, (i think C# will be the best), and then moving to python for the more complex stuff. that way if you want to change to C# and C++ and languages like those, its way easier

Hi, once you have a triangulation, the interpolation surface is basically a bunch of planes. Here each plane `z(x,y) = a0 + a1\*x + a2\*y` is defined over one triangle, and must go through the three points defined by each corner in the triangle. So all one needs to do is to: 1. Figure out which triangle the point (x,y) is in 2. Look up the z-values of each corner 3. Compute the plane coefficients 4. Compute z(x,y) This is made very easy by the fact that Matplotlib has this all built in: https://matplotlib.org/api/tri_api.html#matplotlib.tri.Triangulation - Use `matplotlib.tri.Triangulation` to build a Delunay triangulation - Use `matplotlib.tri.LinearTriInterpolator` to interpolate using this triangulation. There is even a built-in Cubic interpolator that makes the derivatives smooth!
I started learning Python around 26 and landed my first programming job at 30. It took me a few years of side projects to become confident enough. I probably could get a job earlier but I was not interested in minimum wage and intern positions. Also 500€/month sound super low, I guess you mean 500€/month?
For an example on how it can be used, take a look at https://cds.cern.ch/record/1712945 figure 2.18 (page 27).
The front end that displays the pictures will be JS or HTML/CSS. The web framework won't matter and I would probably implement it as a static site unless you wanted advanced search.
I started learning Python a year ago and Im interning as Python dev for the past 3 months. Btw, I'm 34 and started my IT career 3 years ago by starting a CC College. If i had more solid foundations or previous IT experience 6 months ago, it would definitely be possible to land a Python job
This is only the backend, so there's no frontend in this repo, heh. Similar to how Matrix is the backend for Riot.
The reverse proxy in front of the backend only accepts encrypted websocket connections (up to the proxy to decide), and sessions need to have a valid token to be able to use the api. Theoretically some apis can be reverse engineered and someone could release some tool to circumvent certain minor stuff, like see who's logged in as invisible (wouldn't be worth the effort really).
[ipyaggrid](https://link.medium.com/5Hdl9AAK5V) is also interesting.
Just like in factorio *engineer intensifies*
Any github link for the html/css.
Database architect? I guess? Probably a better question for /r/SQL or something.
Sqleeri (sequeleeri)
I've started with Pascal several years ago, but I don't recommend that for today. :) I guess coding language does not matter so much, if you can learn the algorithmic thinking and a single language syntax you win. After learning these two things, you can learn other languages easily (I mean only the syntax, there are lot of language/compiler specific stuff). Python is very good start for beginners, you can do almost everything "easily" with Python. Widely supported, platform independent (With Kivy you can make Android apps too)
I must be an idiot then. When I started self teaching python with 0 previous programming knowledge I struggled with the most trivial concepts for months.
Hey, I made one but not in Flask. It’s in Django. Here is a demo: http://www.aesthetic-chaos.com/ If you are interested in the code, let me know and I will post a github link later.
Hi u/snaftyroot. Thank you for explaining very clearly. I appreciate the time and effort you put in to write to some anonymous person. Your post motivated even more to learn Python. Thank you for that.
Oh well i have seen this website already from githib😁
I agree with the sentiment but disagree with the reasoning. Syntax is easy, I picked up java and c# without issue after a few years of only python. The thing I like about learning those languages first is it forces you to learn OOP and data structures where python abstracts that out.
Or you could just use \`logger.debug\` from the built in \`logger\` module. &amp;#x200B; This is a neat little project though.
Yes, but then you need to choose where to add your logging calls, and which variables to expose in them. So you're left with the same problem as using print statements.
Sorry deleted my comment by accident. Cool then, no need to post the link :)
Hi, i am Working as Word Press Web developer. i Don't know any Coding, Can i tack python language. If i am Tack [Python Training](https://www.softlogicsys.in/python-training-in-chennai/) means What are the Job Position i will get.
That doesn't make you an idiot. We've all been there :) Without prior programming knowledge, you are not only learning (in this case) python but also how to think like a programmer. Using loops, functions, variables etc does not always come naturally at first and debugging takes time to get used to as well. Once the above gets mastered, then learning more techniques/other languages gets significantly easier as you are now thinking in terms of how a computer could solve a problem and not a human

It then uses the Spotipy module to get all albums by the artist, and search each for the song title. If the song is found, the uri is visited, causing it to open in the spotify app (or in browser if you don't have the app) If it isn't found, the song is search for in the format 'song' + 'by' + 'artist' and the top result is loaded in browser
i wouldn't be the person i am today if it wasn't for the help of random strangers, on the internet or otherwise . just remember to help someone else in the future and you're welcome, of course, and good luck!
that sounds reasonable. it's about how long you would spend if you were taking a course and doing homework
This perfectly solves my problem of being too lazy to properly debug speg.
Well I got sometime before I can get student funding because of some legal trouble I recently went through but I can't let that hold me back. I figure if I get a cert in python when I got to school learning other languages should be easier to learn.

No, you are left with logging statements you can direct to a file and turn off the really detailed ones by adjusting the logging level.
Kudos for putting the time in to create this and share it with others. Your python toolbox looks awesome as well.
But you have to write each line manually, that what he is trying to say. With his project you need just one line of code.
Ummmmmmm, python was used to render the first image of a frickin black hole! When faced with uneducated statements like your friends, my general retort is “Suck it Trebek,” =]
this looks tight
It's a bit of a plague with many people in the python community to not produce good debug logging. I guess that because the pdb repl is so easy to use people skip having good logging habits and then you suddenly are in production with 20 servers with not logging and no possibility to just add a breakpoints in the production code.
Check out codingbat.com - a great resource for practicing basic coding logic problems in python
Does this work inside Juypter? It looks like it should.
i understand what u say, but my friend started with python, and moved to C++. it took him a month to understand what is going on with the syntax.
Same I've been in auto motives for 14 years and about two months ago I began my journey, I'd honestly say I had to do a lot of online classes and reading books before everything clicked but since then I can pick up new concepts I feel like at an alright pace
wowza its like shazam but better!
Do you write debug logging for every line and every variable? In my opinion that would produce far too much noise. The point of this tool is to provide very highly detailed information about one piece of code, like a debugger would do, but without the debugger.
This looks cool. Does it just reprint the applicable code blocks during recursion?
I understand the point of this tool, I was making a comment about the wider problem with not enough logging in many python packages and projects. I would say that with debug logging enabled an application should produce what feels like too much and too noisy logging. If you actually need to enable and read it to debug issues in production settings you can selectively enable debug logging for a small set of packages or post process the debug logs using grep/filtering to get a readable output.
why do you make it sound like setting a break point is tremendous overhead? this just seems like encouraging bad practices with extra dependencies
This is so accurate! Logging is so easy - I have no clue why more people don't do it. It's like one line of code inside the try/catch blocks that will literally save you tons of time/energy and keep you informed of exactly what the issue is *before* anyone says anything (if you're logging to a file you can check)... Why people ignore it is beyond me. Lots of people love writing bad code.
I would suggest this (https://realpython.com) wedsite and "Sentdex" on YouTube.
haha, only better if you like your Shazam to be restricted to a single internet radio station... Although my program is quicker for me because I know that I only want it to work with this station so all i have to do is double click a program
If you want to learn python for data science, you can check out the link below - [https://www.listendata.com/2017/05/python-data-science.html](https://www.listendata.com/2017/05/python-data-science.html) You may not learn Python in 3 days as title of this article states. But it will definitely help you to get started with Python. Cheers and all the best!
&gt; why do you make it sound like setting a break point is tremendous overhead? Because setting a breakpoint implies using a debugger, and lots of people work in environments where it's difficult. If you're working on a big corporate codebase, you could have a multi-process, multi-thread Python project that runs on a remote machine. You'll need a full-fledged debugger for that, like Wing IDE or PyCharm.
Nice tool! It would be great to integrate this into [zestyping/q](https://github.com/zestyping/q)
U quite often don’t need to. Occasional and consistent logging practice removes the need for needlessly verbose output. PySnooper is cool, I would definitely use it for development but I definitely wouldn’t use it for release. I wouldn’t recommend classifying pysnooper as an alternative to logging. It’s an alternative to debugging for those without an IDE that supports breakpoints and while it’s cool... it’s overkill. Where this would come in useful is when u have no idea how the flow of your program is going. Adding this to ① function, dumping the output to a file, and then going over it trying to understand is a legitimate use case, but dumping every line of code (even insignificant ones) to the output stream is something you should definitely avoid.
While great for quickly getting a basic trace of a particular function's execution, or when faced with a crappy sprawling, undocumented, uninstrumented codebase, it is no substitution for logging, debug or otherwise, and no replacement for a good step-wise debugger. It focuses on local variables, shows only the class of object instances (rather than reveal parameter values as more traditional debuggers do), and doesn't handle chaining of functions or methods very well.
Obviously it's prints, it's not production oriented, it's more dev oriented.
Don't try to learn python on your own. Instead, find a problem that requires you to build something with python. Then, you'll see that it is not the spoon that bends, it is yourself.
I like this idea. Whenever I use a debugger I either waste too much time setting it up or just sit there going wtf.
Awesome but I don't understand the purpose? Is it because you can or is it to identify a song you like while listening to radio?
Sentdex is the real guy, the best guy.
mostly as a proof of concept (so yeah because I can) but I use it when i hear a song i like (my radio doesn't have a screen so i don't know what's playing) i can press the program on my desktop to open the song, then choose if i want to add it to a playlist
That isn't a solution for me as I work in a code base that is already making use of logging and I don't really want to risk dicking any of the logs up by inserting superfluous messages.
Twitter itself provides APIs to accomplish these actions. I think it does look at the content generated from these actions (and perhaps the rate at which it is generated), and based on that it decides whether to flag such actions as spam or not. Many services use these actions to provide cool insights and information as I mentioned above, but yes people can spam and abuse others via the automation provided by these APIs. The detection algorithms used by Twitter to separate spammers from the genuine guys are not perfect, but they're good enough and perhaps constantly improving. I'll try to make a video on setup once I find time. And thanks for the wishes!
It's hard to set breakpoints a lot of the time if you have code that interacts with other programs/network services. You really need to see whats going on while the program is running, hence logging and not breaking in.
A month isn't so bad - it'd certainly take much more than a month to learn C++ from scratch. Python's very good at keeping you away from the stuff that you don't need to know *yet*. It'll be much easier to learn C++ if you start out knowing about loops, methods, classes, variables, constructors and wotnot, and all you need to learn is the C++ specific stuff (memory management, the STL, typing, header files, macros, etc.). And of course the more languages you know, the easier it is to pick up more. C++ has a reputation as a hard language, so picking up some Java, C#, Go, Rust, Kotlin, Scala, or similar, will help. And this of course assumes that Python is just a stepping stone to those other languages. For many types of project, Python would be my first choice language, and at a push I could make it work for the sorts of projects where it wouldn't be my first choice. It's totally viable to solely be a Python developer.
It's still advisable not to share steam keys, as it could be someone else's. Also, I don't think they were being rude, but your 'first of all' and 'second of all' came off unnecessarily passive aggressive. I believe they were genuinely trying to help.
OP, add django queries per line and you're golden IMO
I'm mostly self taught with python (and programming in general) and I just figured out the logging module. I'm using it everywhere now. I mostly write scripts for people who don't know how to use Linux well in the first place and even in that capacity it opens up the door to just throw a file out there that has all the information I need to figure what's wrong when they call me and tell me something is broken.
It's great for instrumenting local variables and tracing the lines executed in a simple python script contained in a single file, but I wouldn't call it highly detailed. Consider this code: ... class Foo(): def __init__(self): self.a = 1 self.b = 2 self.c = None @pysnooper.snoop() def myfunc(self): localvar = 5 localvar += 1 self.c = self.b + self.a ... pysnooper's output when myfunc is called looks like this: ... Starting var:.. self = &lt;snooptest.Foo instance at 0x1052c5b90&gt; 08:50:38.552499 call 16 @pysnooper.snoop() 08:50:38.553309 line 18 localvar = 5 New var:....... localvar = 5 08:50:38.553382 line 19 localvar += 1 Modified var:.. localvar = 6 08:50:38.553457 line 20 self.c = self.b + self.a 08:50:38.553560 return 20 self.c = self.b + self.a ... PySnooper outputs the lines where attribute c is updated but nothing about the values. I'm not sure what that last line is trying to say because this method returns nothing. You can dig a bit deeper by passing a depth option to the decorator and it will continue its trace into subsequent calls to other functions, which is kinda cool, but if any of those calls are in another file, you better know your codebase really well because ... Starting var:.. thekey = 'FOO-4728' Starting var:.. forceprevious = False 09:01:44.662016 call 23 @pysnooper.snoop(depth=2) 09:01:44.662527 line 25 myrecord = get_keys([thekey], force=True)[thekey] Starting var:.. keys = ['FOO-4728'] ... Now in the above example, the function get_records_relevant is in file1.py and get_keys is in file2.py. While pysnooper nicely indents the call to the second function, there is no indication its in another file. This is an important detail.
The basics of any programming language are easy to learn. Even something as gnarly and ancient as C++, the language itself is cake - for me the struggle is with figuring out the Unreal framework and figuring out which design patterns are best for games and that framework. If you intend to be a web develper, you are going to spend much more time learning working with Flask questions than with Python questions. After that you're going to be learning different frameworks and the fundamentals of architecture, which has a bit more meat to it. For that you'll at least want to be reading code from a few other serious projects, but its best to be on a team, under a senior programmer, working on a serious project. also study [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design\_Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)
Yes, and mnist for pycharm is not the same thing as mnist\_loader, which is why I'm asking if there's a similar command to it for mnist. mnist\_loader doesn't exist for pycharm, check for yourself
MODS ARE ASLEEP! POST REAL PYTHONS!
Python for windows have improved a lot recently, especially with pathlib. I'm using the os.name=='nt' to identify running on windows and on.name=='posix' on linux. I work with QA testing in InternetOfThings and use paramiko, asyncio and subprocess a lot. So I have some checks if we run in powershell or in bash on the serverside and add powershell.exe and proper quoting. I assume this check/difference is about 2% of the entire codebase. I'm using Jenkins with docker and pyenv on linux and teamcity with venv on windows and run the same code. My major complain on windows are the service wrapper and eventlog. But this is solved with nssm.exe and we send logs and telemetry to AppInsight/ElasticSearch/Kibana, so they look almost identical. Cygwin have issues with non ActiveDirectory users, and WSL is slow and only support a subset of ubuntu services. So it is best to keep it all native powershell.
There are several methods these days for creating android apps with py I recently found about chaquopy https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/
It's nice to see an Israeli here who donates his part to the open source community! where r u from in Israel? :)
Umm super doable and... The most important thing for you is to enjoy coding, find cool projects that you want to work on because this is what will drive you to get better and actually want to be good and keep going If you need any help-msg me
setting that up in pycharm is pretty simple and a one- time task. overtime, and a very short time, the overhead required to decorate a function quickly exceeds setting a breakpoint. debuggers aren't scary or difficult
Ditto large scientific projects run on specialist computing facilities. This looks awesome.
it's not difficult at all. i don't know where you're getting that from. if you know the function to decorate, you know where you need to set a breakpoint
Yo this is sick!
You might be better served asking this in /r/learnpython or one of the other options listed in the sidebar: &gt;If you are about to ask a "how do I do this in python" question, please try r/learnpython, the Python discord, or the #python IRC channel on FreeNode.
Agree. Sorry if I made it look children's play. I meant easy in comparison with other programming languages.
&gt;running it forever This means that you entered its endless loop and no code runs afterwards. Try to execute anything (like some print statement) after you invoke that forever call and see it doesn't run.
Cool stuff, I follow a few private accounts, is there anyway to stream those tweets? I wasn't able to access them when using Zapier integration with Discord for some reason.
check github, one of the top libraries
this submission is only dumb because we don’t know what the script does and they are both a bit convoluted. Do you mind dropping a description? I think it would be a lot more fun then to look thru

I made a scarecat once. A webcam is pointing at the desktop. If screensaver is on, and there is movement in the camera for more than five seconds, during which screensaver is not turned off, it barks.
Honestly what's the point having a Python reddit if you can't ask questions pertaining to python? it's arbitrary and stupid. r/learnpython and r/python should be for the same questions. regarding python. If you're not inclined to answer or if you're inclined to be pedantic, just don't bother.
If anything, I'd suggest people to always use autocompletion, since it's kind of a typo checker at the same time. You would use (your own) snippets once you'd realise what parts of your coding is repetitive, so I'm not sure there's much value in rewriting these over and over again, but there's definitely an increase in speed. Not exactly sure about what you meant by graphical designers, but I shudder a little bit every time I hear graphical so I probably agree on this one! &amp;#x200B; So I'd say the features you mentioned are great for beginner and advanced programmer alike, just for different reasons.

The guy didn't provide any code to look at, the description of what he's trying to do is ambiguous and not helpful, and it's clear he's new to Python if he's using python2's SimpleHTTPServer in the first place. So I would argue /r/learnpython, which is *a subreddit focused on learning python*, is a better option than a subreddit *whose focus is news* about Python. It's not my fault you can't be arsed to read the sidebar, it is *very* explicit about what to expect in this subreddit and provides numerous alternatives if you're looking for help with something.
There's no sidebar on mobile! 😑
Shitty, sprawling Epenterprise codebases are in Java tho
This looks really useful for debugging. Nice job! I think where it seems most people are getting confused is debug logging and debugging in general. This isn’t a replacement for proper logging. This is a quick and “dirty” replacement for having to setup a debugger.
https://github.com/gruns/icecream
And that's the subreddit's fault?
I really don't understand all the negativity, from people who the product is completely unsuited for. Yes, if you have a perfectly good debugging workflow, don't use it. Seriously, it's okay. The rest of us who have a particular need for it for one reason or another, will appreciate it.
Yep! In the script it explains fully how to do it. You'll see towards the top a dictionary of names and ID's like this idsdict = { 'CNN Breaking': 428333, 'CNN': 759251, 'NYT': 807095, 'Elon Musk': 44196397, 'Breaking911': 375721095, 'News Breaking': 18112970, 'RT': 64643056, 'WSJ Breaking News': 23484039, 'Fox News': 1367531 } What you name it doesn't matter. The names output to the console that's all. Lookup Twitter ID's [here](https://tweeterid.com/) by entering the accounts @Usernamehandle (without the @) Make sure on the top of the script FollowerMode = True
This is better asked on /r/learnpython. Could you perhaps elaborate on the requirement to use C# for database interactions? Python has pretty good database support, with sqlite being in the standard library. From what I understand, you're wanting to use python to query a database but C# to update and delete; why not do that in python?
Neither one does anything of importance and they're kinda hard to describe lol. The first one makes a weird zig zag that speeds up and slows down. The second one has a number that goes slowly randomly between -10 to +10 starting at 0. It has arrows next to it that change direction depending on if its positive or negative and it increases in size the farther out from 0 you get. If you get past -10 or +10, it slightly increases the chance to get back between those numbers. Like I said very pointless. I guess I'm the only one that makes stupid shit in Python.
lol nice
This is honestly so cool. I didn't even realize the need for something like this until now. Will def be using it in the future.
From past knowledgeof GUI tools, they can be great, but they should always have an option to show the underlying script that would, when entered on the input dataframe, give the same results as that achieved by the GUI mainpulations. You could then use QGrid to learn Pandas or script transformations instead of using the GUI when you want repeatability for example. &amp;#x200B; Looks good though.
Well, if the object is an instance of a class you've implemented, you could impelement "\_\_repr\_\_" and "\_\_str\_\_" methods and just use print or repr
Trying to learn how to integrate other languages w/ python. &amp;#x200B; Also thanks for the direction @nathanjell to /r/learnpython
And while you sit at your interactive breakpoint, a network timeout occurs and completely changes the scenario.. That being said I believe in debuggers. But they are not always applicable.
Genial!!!!
This! I work in emacs and most of my work runs in Jenkins and cannot be run in a local environment due to the way we're setup. Our code have functions that are 47294729472 levels deep. This tool makes it so I don't have to go add debugging lines everywhere just for me to go remove them later. Kudos op, I will definitely try this!
Wouldn't someone working on a "big corporate codebase" have a PyCharm professional license?
Try using an ide which gives you indentation lines, it's essentially what you have done here but in software. I recommend VSCode
It's not about getting the license, it's about doing the remote debugging setup and maintaining it. I've seen it first-hand on many projects, it's a big investment that not everybody are willing to do.
VSCode is pretty good. I use it, sublime and vim to cover all my possible needs
Well, there is a whole logging module for that exact task.
I’ll go in to the editors options and search for that option
♥️❤️ yeah it looks really useful.
&gt; Check the TIOBE index for statistics. Don't do this. The TIOBE index is pretty much junk. It only takes into account users that search for specific terms IIRC.
Sublime Text is written in C++ with a Python API.
 [https://github.com/iipeace/guider](https://github.com/iipeace/guider)
Try searching for indent guides specifically that's the correct name
I'm not sure they are Israeli, but either way a lot of us contribute. Not all of us have very Israeli names or otherwise display nationality because of the politics that inevitably creep in, which really don't belong in a project.
Seems really useful for debugging some issues on a remote server :)
&gt; setting that up in pycharm is pretty simple and a one- time task For some use cases.
Nobody is immune to shitty, sprawling codebases
&gt; this method returns nothing. Python functions without a return statement implicitly return None which could be argued is not nothing. I'm guessing it's just marking the last line in the function to tell you that it's returning. Could be stated in a better way though.
Looks awesome. Will use it to debug my shitty Ansible modlue.
Best of luck!

This bot needs to get smarter. This is about tinkering around making stuff in Python, not about learning Python. lol
I'm surprised a lot of people here are complaining about debuggers and how long it takes to set them up, but no one mentioned [pdb](https://docs.python.org/2/library/pdb.html) which requires literally no setup.
It’s an it’s an internal IDE built on top of VS., which oddly doesn’t seem to have the indentation option
It’s call Athena studios ( ide built on top in VS) which seem like the indentation option is not available
Logging is extremely helpful in production level systems. Unless you intend to keep the pysnooper in production (which seems like a performance drag), it's generally better to have logging. Additionally, you will want to have logging enabled and sent to stdout (which sort of moves back to ... maybe print is exactly what you need) when your systems are distributed across multiple nodes or pods in a kubernetes cluster and you are using a log-shipper. This is no doubt a cool project. I just want to point out that it's not a replacement for generally a best practice of logging stuff.
You can also do: def my_awesome_stringify(self): return f'awesome{self.foo}' setattr(Bar, '__str__',my_awesome_stringify)
Your code may run fine, but the data your receiving from the other end may not be. Breaking your code is useless.
Very cool. Also great for seeing what the hell is going on in some random python code you just downloaded off github.
You can still log with this for persistence. This is more for development debugging. Otherwise you have to log each time a variable would possibly change. Maintaining that log, or even reading it, would be frustrating.
It would be nice if you could pass in some logger object as an output. This might have been addressed by now but I last saw this some hours ago and the documentation didn't have an example of this.
Can you maybe write a brief tutorial on how to write a python bot that would reply when tagged/mentioned. I want to achieve something like - @twitterBot tell me a joke?! the python program would then reply to that user with a joke/meme Please share any link if any. Most of the tutorials I saw is not helping my cause and are mostly written in NodeJS. Thanks
Did someone say COBOL?
masochist much?
You can pass any writable stream, i.e. any object you can run `obj.write(s)` on. I'd accept a pull request that would allow passing in a logger, if it will come with tests.
And?
I think the point is to use this when you're given a project without sufficient logging and you need to figure out what's going on (and you don't want to set up a debugger).
/r/learnpython, and format your code properly.
The title "Never use print for debugging again" suggests otherwise.
read the sidebar
Here's a common use case: it's actually quite tricky to get pycharm working as a remote debugger for Jupiter notebook in scientific computing/machine learning prototyping. I can see tools like this being very useful for a quick troubleshooting.
&gt; That's problematic in Python 3 as it's ask Unicode by default. I mention that a couple paragraphs later: &gt; We’re not actually ordering alphabetically here so much as ASCII-betically (unicode-betically really since we’re in Python 3). These strings are being ordered by the ASCII values of their characters (p is 112 in ASCII and P is 80). I wouldn't say it's a problem to think in ASCII because the entire ASCII table is embedded within the Unicode character set. &gt; Also, no mention of `i`s vs `==`? I didn't mention `is` here because it's rarely used with non-singletons. I do have an [article on sentinels and unique values](https://treyhunner.com/2019/03/unique-and-sentinel-values-in-python/) which discusses `is` more thoroughly. I've never wanted/needed a deep identity check so I didn't think to mention it.
That's part of it, but a good deployment of key deliverables for vertical integration on the enterprise leverages a strategic mix of incomprehensible 20 year old Perl scripts, C++ that has to be compiled with an obsolete version of gcc, a few million lines of Java code that's *mostly* generated from XML somewhere, and of course, a Python package for orchestration of a shitload of monkey-patched shell scripts.
That's actually pretty sweet looking. Nice job.
I know precisely what I'm talking about, if you don't then that's on you to figure out. There are some large systems that can only be examined in flight and breaking in at that point messes with the observation of the bug. Sometimes logging is the only way to find a problem.
[repl.it](https://repl.it/) has become quite good lately.
Seems that this does not support windows, is that correct?
WSGI and decent framework are the keys to running websites based on python. I personally found MVC frameworks too heavy handed for my needs. Several years ago I found web.py ([webpy.org](https://webpy.org)) which was used to build the first versions of reddit. The founder has sadly passed but the project is still maintained. Web.py was billed as an anti framework meaning that you could shape it out any way you liked. Over time I ended up building my own simplifications to it and created a simple way to program my pages using YAML configuration files. If you are interested in giving it a try you can find it here: [https://webyaml.com](https://webyaml.com) It can run in stand alone mode for testing and development and when you are ready you can switch to full WSGI mode with no code changes. It has been tested on cloud servers, win10 (WSL), and even tiny IoT boards running linux.
you dont have space after first text. will return error.

You could also use three single quotes. So maybe put your function descriptors in triple quotes and your spanning comments in triple single quotes. FWIW triple quotes really means multiline string. so a comment like that is nothing more than an unassigned string. &gt;"This is like a comment" &gt; &gt;"""This is also like &gt; &gt;a comment""" &gt; &gt;mystring = """this is &gt; &gt;an assigned string""" more info can be found here: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7057450/why-does-python-use-unconventional-triple-quotation-marks-for-comments/7057488#7057488](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7057450/why-does-python-use-unconventional-triple-quotation-marks-for-comments/7057488#7057488)

It should work fine on windows too. It's basically pure python with some service dependencies. We're using miniconda for running it on linux, and that's available on windows as well.
Stfu, you’re toxic and judgmental at a “professional” community. That being said, you don’t have any knowledge of what I am doing. By the way, pyOpenSSL wouldn’t do the trick, it has restrictions. Finished implementation in Ruby.
as mentioned in the question, I was looking at something as easy to use as console.log() in JS, not pprint. Which module were you suggesting?
yes, but that forces me to implement these functions. Is there any way to get a default __repr__ implementation for objects?
With a little effort one could write Shitty, sprawling Epenterprise codebases in any language.
I can’t tell you how many developers I’ve met, ranging from junior to very senior, were incapable of using a debugger. It blows my mind. It’s not hard at all, and generally let’s you solve your problem quicker than stuff like this
I might be able to make a tutorial tonight. There's probably a couple of ways to do it. The API does include this "api.mentions_timeline()" but that's probably better for if you're looking up historical tweets. I could be wrong. If you're actively monitoring who mentions you, there's another way to do it using Stream to monitor just your timeline. I don't know how reliable it is, but I've monitored my own timeline and tweets on my timeline came through to my console just fine. You could possibly do something like this for pulling up historical data instead of realtime streaming (NOTE: This is code I took from [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24070689/how-to-filter-stream-by-mentions)). I don't know if it works, but I believe that's how you construct the API variable below. This code would go just below the authentication part in the script. auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key='AAA', consumer_secret='BBB') auth.set_access_token('CCC', 'DDD') api = tweepy.API(auth_handler=auth, secure=True, retry_count=5) mentions = api.mentions_timeline() for mention in mentions: print(mention.id, mention.author.screen_name, mention.text) Then you can run the last part(for mention in mentions:) in a loop and have it check every second or two, and store every tweet ID into a file so you can keep track of who you replied to.. Or just stream the tweets and respond in realtime. Personally I like streaming stuff so I'd probably do that and not mess with the mention stuff. You will still need to connect to the API this way regardless using "api= tweepy.API etc" for the reply functionality below. What you want to do is monitor your own timeline. This is easy to do with the script in my github link here. Narrow that follower dictionary towards the top of the script down to one person, you. Use your [twitter ID](http://gettwitterid.com/). On line 127 of that script you'll see if FollowerMode == True and userid in ids: and change that to if FollowerMode == True and userid not in ids: Now that will stream everyone else on your timeline EXCEPT you. Then get the text for all the tweets that come through. There's a couple ways to do this. You can check each tweet on your profile for '@twitterBot' using this code try: text = status.extended_tweet['full_text'] except AttributeError: text = status.text [This](https://pastebin.com/55AUMqLq) is all the info that came from a single tweet that I just streamed. I did print(status) to get it. It's a good example because it was a mention. So for every tweet you're streaming, you could check to see if there's a mention in the JSON or you could just check the text above for the first word being @twitterBot like this botname = '@twitterBot' firstword = text[0:len(botname)] # or firstword = text.split()[0] if firstword == botname: replytext = "Whatever you want to reply with here" api.update_status('@' + status.user.screen_name + ' ' + replytext, status.user.id) right under line 151 where the variable 'text' is defined. And like I said at the top of this comment, the api.update_status would need to come from the API variable that you need to include. I know this is a lot, but hopefully it points you in the right direction lol. If you have any questions feel free to ask. I'll probably make this tonight at work.
Edited my reply 5min after commenting.
off the top of my head i think the issue is that you are only handling a small set of exceptions. If the try never completes and it is not one of your defined exceptions it will never break. I would add the a generic except at the end to show you what else it may be breaking. And I would but a finally statement after that to output something useful to see if it is looping are blocking.

Hi! That looks like an interesting project for learning argparse and a bit of how python works. FYI, there's a function `help()` which you can call from interpreter. It inspects `__doc__` properties (e.g. `str.__doc__`) of a passed object and its members and forms a nice overview of what's there in that object. You can do something similar to it if you wish. Also, I find ipython with its autocomplete capabilities and [`?` sugar](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/01.01-help-and-documentation.html) extremely useful.
Weekend project to combine my constant browsing of PyCon/SciPy videos on YouTube with wanting to play with the YouTube data API. Aggregated the last 5 years of videos from those two conferences and made a Flask app. Browse by conference/year, tagged with speaker and text search. &amp;#x200B; [https://pythonconferencevideos.com](https://pythonconferencevideos.com) &amp;#x200B; At some point I might try some auto-tagging of the videos from the description or downloaded transcripts.
Thank you a lot for the help. Maybe I had a big misunderstanding that prevented me from grasping the delaunay triangulation approach. Although I have myself a 3D dataset the delaunay triangulation creates out of my datasets a 2D mesh ... I always thought (whyever) that this mesh must be for my interpolation needs in 3D as well.
Yeah actually I saw the help function but I just made this because I can type "pelp python all" and it'll throw the methods for string, list, dict and array onto my terminal. I still use other resources if I'm still confused, I mainly use this to remind myself of how things work rather than learn something new. I just thought it would be a little quicker than calling help on string, list, dict and set
Oh you said brief lol mybad. I think my comment was like a brief tutorial though was it not? It's not nearly as big as some of the tutorials I find online. I can make an actual tutorial tonight though with a full script for it.. So at least it's available for people who want quick access to it. Honestly I just installed tweepy the other night but I spent the last couple nights at work getting familiar with it here and there and writing and playing around with my script. It's a pretty straight forward api.

just another syntax cover :)
This is a good idea, but would any other exception not automatically raise an error and hence output a Traceback error to the console? I have tried a general except statement before, but I'll implement it again and also add a finally statement.
Wow! Thank you very much. I need some direction, rest I'll try to figure out. I've started with Tweepy, so far have reached to the point where I run y code and BOOM! a tweet is posted - This is so much fun for me as a beginner. I'm trying to write a bot which would respond to tweet. I would wait for your code-tutorial. Again, thanks a ton for taking time out and commenting.

Tabs or spaces...
No problem! Glad I could help. I started out in python by making reddit bots. The concept is very similar. If you start to get bored with tweepy, I highly recommend praw for reddit. That's good you were able to make replying work. If I were you, I'd try to take what I typed in my comment and learn to apply what you know about replying into my example script before seeing what I make. It's pretty much set up for that already so it would take very minimal effort. If you're not comfortable doing that yet it's all good. I'm still learning myself. Not just tweepy but python in general. I'm still new to python lol.
For debugging, your strategy is no better than print, and longer to type, unless you expect to keep the debugging statements in.
This is something completely different...
&gt; to not produce good debug level logging But debug level logging is mostly useless. It doesn't help me in production, because it's not turned on. But if you have a large project with a lot of debug level logging and you turn it on, you get a firehose of information, mostly uninteresting. A lot of people, myself included, put print statements in temporarily that you just discard afterwards. This is much better than that.
It's often _impossible._ For example, a project I was recently running was a real-time lighting control system. Setting a breakpoint was useless, because the real time jobs would get backed up in a few milliseconds and then the whole system would go down.

If you're a shitty enough programmer you don't tend to have as much sprawl. Source: I'm wicked shitty programmer.
is your website running on a Python framework? this sounds like something that should be done server-side if the user is building the product image on your website

It's at least implying the values in the last line are returned, which they are not. That falls somewhere between misleading and flat-out wrong.
We actually have debug logging constantly turned on for some services. I've solved countless of bugs with the help of debug logging. These days conditional service wide request trace logging has somewhat replaced this need though since trace can be enabled on a per request/user condition with request id's shared between all services involved.
Please don't take offense at my feedback, overall a good article. You're right that `is` is used for singletons. It's commonly used for `None`, which is, as you know, a singleton
Jupyter Notebooks
probably the other way around
But that's exactly when you (traditionally) use \`print()\` or similar for debugging.
Apple vs orange
&gt;It's scaling vertically over multiple instances/servers. Vertical scaling is increasing CPU, memory on a single instance. Horizontal scaling is when you increase the number of servers.
pywin32, probably FindWindow and GetWindowText API.

Cheers, edited. I'm lacking sleep lately lol.
If I understand correctly, you have some kind of javascript engine that renders your stuff in canvas and that's out of reach for your server side code? If that's true then afaik you can't do much then run selenium in xvfb or something like that and make a screenshot after providing the arguments you collected from user.

this might help: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16511337/correct-way-to-try-except-using-python-requests-module](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16511337/correct-way-to-try-except-using-python-requests-module) and this [https://2.python-requests.org//en/latest/user/quickstart/#errors-and-exceptions](https://2.python-requests.org//en/latest/user/quickstart/#errors-and-exceptions)
Refactor, refactor, refactor. That will make bugs easier to spot (including mismatched parentheses For example, I would write the code you have sort of like this: if hydra.ham(spam): slopnifate_text(hydra) if not knights_who_say_ni(): iki_iki_petang_zu(boing) else: pass #FIXME: intricate the goober ... depending on what's exactly going on. If there are a lot of arguments I have to pass to these smaller functions, that prompts me to ask myself: * Are these disparate variables actually referring to something that should be a single entity? * Am I doing the separation of concerns right? The answers usually guide me to further changes I should made. In the end, my code is usually more readable, more maintainable and more easily extensible. Rule of thumb: if a function has a body of more than seven lines or more than two levels of indentations (two is often pushing it), it probably should be refactored.
I tried this out and it doesn't seem to work with asyncio.
My personal github is at 48 repos and counting.
They are big and notable for their public nature but they are not what you will see in the rest of industry. Interestingly your references highlight a common problem often seen on the forums. That is people thinking web development is the only thing going on in the world of software. Obviously it isn’t and frankly it is largely trivial programming.
&gt; so I can prove him otherwise This isn't a thing worth doing. Just nod and say "thank you for your input".
I don't know the websites but if the data is offered through the site you can extract it. If they don't have an api to do it look at webscraping libs like beautifulsoup. On the question of how long it will take, that will depend on how fast you can learn and how complex the websites are On the question of statistical languages, an other popular one is R. It will allow you to do more than statistical modelling but execution wise it is slower than python. But some libraries hive higher accuracy when it comes to modelling
If you can read that data then your code can do that too. If you can manually calculate what you need then your code can do that too. So, it's probably possible if you researched flashs ore and you know you can get that data. But, maybe flashscore doesn't want you to do that and does some steps to stop you. Then you're not fucked up totally, but you have to invest more time and effort. And finally, noone can tell how much time some person without programming language will spend to bring thatproject in production, but surely that time won't be presented rounded in hours.
The subject line of "never use print for debugging again" immediately sent the discussion down a bad path.
maybe it needs this? except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e: print(e) I know that seems stupid, but without tearing through a lot of code you are only assuming that somewhere in the chain of extended classes of classes requests.exceptions.RequestException is based on Exception. But the docs say all requests exceptions are based on RequestException. One last thing i found may also be helpful: [https://2.python-requests.org//en/master/\_modules/requests/exceptions/](https://2.python-requests.org//en/master/_modules/requests/exceptions/) I use requests all the time, so i would like to know how this pans out.
&gt; I don’t get the reference to the red uniforms, haha :D https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2qimt8 &gt; What would you say a scripter lacks compared to a programmer? a scripter writes code to solve a mathematical or technical problem. A programmer knows how to organise code.
Python is quite a step up from Scratch but I think its the natural next step if you've already mastered Scratch.
Pretty sure upthread poster was talking about [logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html).
Sure, but the default representation of an object is just its ID. It isn't very useful. What you are asking for is something js does because of its origins in browsers. It's a nice feature you don't typically see elsewhere.
log format sharing time. Here's one of mine: format='%(asctime)s %(levelname)-8s: \[%(funcName)-12.12s %(lineno)d\] %(message)s' Logs in that format are then sent to a log file that is named using this: logfile = '{year:04d}{mon:02d}{day:02d}.log'.format(year=t.year, mon=t.month, [day=t.day](https://day=t.day)) Gives daily rotated log files that can be easily managed (e.g. compressed or deleted). Doesn't work well for long-running python scripts but for those that run for less than a day, it's worked great for me. I also like [https://github.com/acschaefer/duallog](https://github.com/acschaefer/duallog) for sending logs to the console and a file simultaneously at different logging levels.
&gt;But debug level logging is mostly useless. &gt; &gt;It doesn't help me in production, because it's not turned on. But if you have a large project with a lot of debug level logging and you turn it on, you get a firehose of information, mostly uninteresting. That's because debug level logging should not be in production. One of our ops people chewed me out last week for leaving debug level logging turned on in a groovy script that gets called a brazilian times, he was right to be upset. But that debug level logging was very far from useless in debugging that same script a few hours earlier. We just forgot to reset the debug level.
Makes sense, feel free to submit a feature request.
Good point, this requires some really close log file management though, which properly planned for is no big deal. Rotate rather than build up a single monolithic log file and toss and compress those old files regularly.
Another one? for fucks sake...
Thank you for this :)
Learning programming in general is very easy to learn by yourself. You just need to get a few concepts down. &amp;#x200B; Variables If statements Loops Functions Classes (optional when starting out) &amp;#x200B; If you know that and some basic keywords for your language of choice, you can start making simple programs. Once you understand the above things, you can write simple code in just about any language. Python might be a good language to start out with. You'll learn, for example, what a function is. Then take that knowledge to c++, where you will learn what the stack pointer of a function is. But all this "it's easy" talk is because I learned the other way around; c++ first. I guess it depends on your career goals.
… they are not about “web development”
Have you never worked in multi-threaded environments? Or environments without a clear entry point? Or environments abstracted under a CI shim like docker? Or environments that only call the python with some complicated script setup that resolves a bunch of environment variables? There are so many instances in which attaching a debugger is such a PITA that it’s better to just read the code &amp; guess at its behavior instead of getting the answers you need.
Python ones are the same but without any type indicators.
holy shit
Depends of course on what you want to do with it, but it sounds like you just have 2 independent variables, so the mesh should be 2d.
To be fair, using print for debugging should be the absolutely last resort. That most of us start there sucks major ass.
If you are scraping tweets then you are not using the Twitter API. Why would you use the API if you are scraping? And, visa-versa, why would you scrape if you are using the API?
That was worth a try. Unfortunately, no change. except requests.exceptions.RequestException as error: logging.exception("{} {}".format(my_url, datetime.datetime.utcnow())) print(error) finally: print(my_url[0:30], "Request over")
Context my man context! There is a large number of programmers out there that can’t even grasp that there is much more to the industry than web development. While the guy that the original poster referenced might be an ass for belittling Python there is a whole world out there where Python is never seen. Thus it is very easy for somebody to see Python as an obscure programming language.
This looks handy for when you want a quick trace of a single function, but seems like it'd get way to noisy for any cross cutting issues where print debugging would still be much better.
Collect all the configuration points via a submission and reproduce on your end. This also serves as a QA point for the customer, and you, to double check that all the data for the configurations came through correctly.
Thanks for the suggestions
I disagree, but I can't seem to articulate why. For some reason, it feels cleaner to me to import a class and use static methods contained therein than to import a module and use functions contained therein.

What's the point of using a class as a module?
If you know of the `logging`, `pdb`, and other code intelligence till in existence and still don't see the value in this lib... I envy you for the code-base you seem to be maintaining.
Limiting factor here is your web scraping/ data mining. Python can do these things pretty effectively as long as the website has not set up measures to stop this, ie it might cut your access if it sees its being pinged from the same ip over and over. Some websites will offer an API or an extract so I highly recommend you inquire on that before spending time building out a web scraping function. Personally, nothing makes me happier than a good API, although it could cost you $$. &amp;#x200B; Overall, these things are not difficult and someone with a few months of python experience could Google/stackoverflow their way through this on a small scale over a couple weeks.
Why not simply use a random token? You don't need to use the URL as an index or anything. As scooerp pointed out, you need to account for duplicates as well. from secrets import token_urlsafe def get_short_url(): attempt = token_urlsafe(5) # the length your shortener uses while FIXME_database_has_key(attempt): # check your database, so the token is unique attempt = token_urlsafe(5) return attempt It would be even better to make it atomic, in a way something like this: def shorten(url): while True: try: return FIXME_insert_into_database(short=token_urlsafe(5), long=url) except FIXME_DatabaseInsertDuplicatePrimaryKey: pass # retry Note that both of these start running slower when you approach ~1 trillion urls inserted, until they become an infinite loop when it's completely filled up. So you might want to start allowing for some longer created "short" urls if your service becomes popular. ;) Oh and my second example relies on having the short url be the primary key.
I'd say give it a shot. The main difference is that Django follows the *everything included* mindset so you don't need to tack on additional tools. Flask is less rigid but will be missing things like an admin panel. [Here is a thorough write up on the differences](http://www.mindfiresolutions.com/blog/2018/05/flask-vs-django/).
For people who like this idea but do have more control over where and how their code is run, I highly recommend https://github.com/alexmojaki/birdseye . Most of the time I just use (i)pdb, but for those moments were the execution is too complex to grok by simply stepping through it, it's perfect.
For python web apps, maybe Anvil - https://anvil.works/
I could not figure out how to make it fail. but if you really can't get it working you might consider something like this. `def proxy_request(my_url):` `while True: #try request over and over again if it fails for some reason` &amp;#x200B; `source = False` `proxies = {"https": "XXXXXXXX", "http": "XXXXXXX"}` `headers = {'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_1) AppleWebKit/537.73.11 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/7.0.1 Safari/537.73.11'}` `source = requests.get(my_url, proxies=proxies, headers=headers, timeout=5)` &amp;#x200B; `if source.status_code == 200:` `return source`

Ah, I assumed it would be so you could fluidly continue listening to music when the station went to ads.
Yea Python is really effective for web scraping and data processing. It's an easy language to learn so that's a plus. You could easily learn and get this project done in a few months if you put the time into it.
The way you are doing so right now - doing coding problems the best you can, seeing better ways of doing it, and learning from that experience. Although to be fair, it's not always necessarily better to try and pack code into as few lines as possible, but seeing different ways of solving the same problem will help you.
I'd be wary of the thinking that one/less lines is better. In terms of productivity, it can be more productive to be more verbose as it's easier to follow/maintain. I think it's just a case of doing it more often, getting code reviews of your work(feel free to defend your code too here don't take all comments as blindly true) and finding the balance between clean, concise and understandable code.
I agree, I mean I want to learn more of this (making my code shorter and yet working). Is there any guide/tutorial for this?
sure, if there were tiers of debug loglevel. there aren't.
 Looks cool
Also with a lot of effort.
Makes sense, feel free to submit a feature request.
How is this not called snoo**py**?
I think the argument that one liners are less readable or harder to maintain is used too often. One liners shouldn't be a virtue in and of themselves, and trying to shoe-horn complicated logic in to a one-liner does lead to an unreadable mess, yes. The thing is, the second code snippet in the original post is more readable, it's terse, but any python programmer can read and understand it, and it can be read and understood far more quickly than the more verbose equivalent.
TBH there is nothing inherently wrong with a verbose solution as all the conditions were met. Wrap your code with some timers and see how performant each solution is as that is also a good exercise in this case. I think that being able to profile your solution and manage memory ‘pressures’ and disk IO override elegant 1 liners. But If you are wanting to develop elegant solutions: 1. Don’t worry about elegance until you have a solution 2. When you have a solution, apply common refactoring principles to your code. 3. If you don’t know refactoring, read about it. By doing this lots and lots you eventually see these types of patterns in your head and in code and eventually come to be able to choose the appropriateness of verbosity over elegance or when refactoring is necessary.
Please elaborate. As far as I can tell printing to terminal or some log file is the best if not only way to inspect what your code is doing.
Between step one and two, add tests :)
But what if your python script is one giant set of instructions with no main and no functions?
Same problem here, let me know if you solved it
I'm gonna file that under "outside the scope", sorry. It can be done, just too esoteric to include.
I remember when I used to use Hackerrank, in the discussions section, lots of people posted their code and that was a good way to find out about neat tricks in Python that led to concise solutions. This could be a good way to go but I don't know of an actual tutorial or book that's dedicated towards making code more concise. A natural way to go might be to simply learn more about Python's standard built in libraries to avoid reproducing things that are already built for you there, or other libraries beyond that (although this is irrelevant to your specific example, I think it would help in some other situations).
My feelings exactly. It seems to be a all-in-one implementation for many different formats and also introducing its own toml configuration file. setuptools + virtualenv aren't perfect but they work and are well understood.
Loggin useful data in a planned way is completely different to add print lines at will to find a bug.
 Python has amazing logging and debugging features, both of which are far superior and recommended to printing with the print command. I'll admit to using printing now and then, but I know it's only because I'm lazy and need something fast, not because I'm doing the right thing at all.
Exactly. Also I was talking about the print command, not logging which is quite different.
OK. But you underestimate how bad some enterprise codebase is. haha
This isn't really a Python question, it's more about learning how to "think" in code. I recommend trying LOTS of different learning resources (use the free ones) and reading examples until things start to click. Also, if you've payed Udemy hopefully you can reach out to them. &amp;#x200B; After some random googling I found this blog post that looks like it could help you: [https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2)
I'm running python from C# using pythonnet and this is just perfect, thank you!
Sounds like one is just a more pre-emptive version of the other. I'll look into the debugging and logging features of python and maybe I'll develop the same appreciation you have.
you left client id and secret in there. :(
What did the asshole say?
You can't ask for help and not help those who want to help you. Format your code properly so we can run it or interpret it correctly. As it is we cannot help you.
I second this. I would have used OP's solution minus the \`else\` statements.
Yup, I don't know about the other sites, but you can do graphical stuff there too.
Lol I suppose if the message is gone I might as well let the whole thing vanish and keep the thread happy.
Definately context managers such as `with open() as ...`, `try-except-finally` blocks...
Not when you hire Java developers foryour Python project.
Yeah not the best thing you can do ... :/
A class can be another layer of organization. You can ask, why add a class when you could add another module, but then again, you might ask what's the point of having another module when you could just add it to an existing module. Everything could just go in one file. I'm not *sure* that it's useful to have another layer of organization, but I can't think of an argument against a class containing staticmethods (or really classmethods when I prefer) that wouldn't also apply to a module. It seems that sometimes a class is just a useful namespace just like sometimes a module is a useful namespace.
Since the function never passes the request when it's hanging, this doesn't address the issue, unfortunately.
If you need to add code for debugging and take it away for production code, I would consider this as a potential liability, printing to stout is not cheap and jeez, this prints quite a lot. I understand there might be some use cases, but those should not exist on the first place.
True, it was more of a warning to be aware that just because it's shorter doesn't necessarily mean it's better. This particular problem is pretty simple, but a real life problem might not be so and trying to shorten everything for the sake of shortness is a danger. Equally if I'm looking at a stacktrace the first one will tell me the exact issue whereas the short version will require more work.
can you give me a reasonable example when a class, rather than a module, is a namespace? A class is a blueprint to something that has state and behavior. staticmethod provides neither. If you need a namespace, python uses modules for namespaces.

Its kind of like asking why have a folder structure more than one level deep. A class can be a blueprint to state and behavior. I think the argument you have to provide is does it have to be exclusively for that. Maybe it does, but I'm not seeing a knockdown argument that that is so.
RStudio does that for the data load, you have the option to change encoding, skip rows, filter/format columns etc. with the Data Table preview. You always get the code at the bottom so I can add it to my Data Load chunk of the notebook. Makes my work way easier.
Are you serious with those 7 lines or are you joking? I'm all for splitting code into functions and modules, but that limit is bound to make your code less readable rather than more readable.
Just started with python today! But hopefully will be making a text based game by the end of the week!
This is a common recommendation. As with all things, context is important. &amp;#x200B; If you write with a very imperative style then the 7 line guideline seems insane. If you write with a functional style then the 7 line guideline can seem generous to a fault. &amp;#x200B; I'll add my own guideline that makes no damned sense for people who write with an imperative style, try to avoid if/else as much as possible.
I've been wondering what he uses. I love 3blue1brown's videos on YouTube. Highly recommended for anyone who likes math.
I've gotten Python logging working before, but I've never felt the effort was justified. I would love for a fan to elaborate on why they like it - not because I doubt them, but because it's a perspective that's entirely separate from my own experience. For me, the built-in modules are a textbook example of something that's overbuilt, hard to set up or navigate, and fits enterprise needs at the expense of other users.
You ok? Blink twice if they're keeping you against your will.

Two winks zero blinks. Ok then looks good all unit tests pass ship it.
easily some of the best math videos around. Love his videos.
You can write Java in any language.
The source code for the mu editor is pretty manageable IMO. [This talk by one of the requests developers](https://youtu.be/ptbCIvve6-k) actually goes through a number of reasons that requests *isn’t* a very good example to learn from.
data structure and algorithm. if you get a job as software engineer the programming language doesn't matter. if you project requires the ruby, then you code with ruby. if need to use c, then code C. if you understand data structure and know how to make good algorithm any language doesn't matter. but if you get a python job and if your project decided not to use python anymore, you are done, go home
This should do it: Import os list_of_folders = os.listdir(parent_folder_path) df = pd.Dataframe(data =list_of_folders, columns=[‘name of column’] df[‘source’] = parent_folder_path If you put this in a For loop and append the results you can get them all in one dataframe.

Overlaps a bit with [@loguru.logger.catch](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru#exceptions-catching-within-threads-or-main), which has a nice backtrace option.
That's post-mortem analysis, not (interactive) debugging.
I have truly just started to dig into python. I am working on a contact list app where I can retrieve and add contacts. I want to eventually be able to sort for only specific information / people and also be able to edit specific information.
My work we have sprawling cancerous Java AND python codebases. We are the future.
... this is my life... only I’m responsible for half of it 😔
Hahah no problem. If you have any issues let me know.
I generally use static methods a private methods for simple functions that only make sense inside the class. Do you think it would be better to use functions in this case too? I could always use a module level private function but I don't really see why that's better than a static method.
F
I loled.

I'm in aerospace, but do a lot of structural engineering and have done analysis for buildings. Python is incredibly useful for scripting structural analyses that you'd otherwise do in excel. It's also great for processing huge structural models. The civil analysis project I did was to add a series of platforms on the side of a ride. We had to make sure the static margins were positive for the platforms and that we didn't change the behavior of any of the existing structure (i.e., load path changes creating an improvement or worsening of any beam) for \~750 load cases. It was also required that foundation loads for every load case be explicitly called out. I also analyzed about 100 different positions of the ride to make sure the fatigue loading was captured correctly. You're not going to do that in Excel. I scripted all that and auto-wrote figures and tables to a Word document. I then went in by hand and did some formatting. &amp;#x200B; Now once I found the worst case loads, I did things like 3D contact analysis in Ansys and hand calc analysis (e.g., lateral torsional buckling) in Excel.
The original quote comes from Ed Post: ["the determined Real Programmer can write FORTRAN in any language"](https://web.mit.edu/humor/Computers/real.programmers)
I read somewhere that he doesn't think other people should use this because it's geared towards only his use case
I'd use a function if I wanted a function. I want that function as part of the class as it doesn't make sense outside the context of that class. It simplifies the API for the end user.
Is this supposed to help?
As the sidebar says: &gt; If you are about to ask a "how do I do this in python" question, please try r/learnpython, the Python discord, or the #python IRC channel on FreeNode.
&gt;staticmethod provides neither How does it not provide behavior? Does a function not do something? Shoot a function can take arguments and have the first argument be self. We can now get rid of class methods as well.
I usually use a format similar to googles glog format, this is from a django application: ``` 'format': '%(levelname).1s%(asctime)s.%(msecs)d %(name)s:%(lineno)d %(message)s', 'datefmt': '%m%d %H:%M:%S', ``` Depending on the application a thread id and/or request id is also added.
python - m pdb yourScript.py
Not sure what level of detail you're expecting to get, but the program for this is actually fairly complicated, so this will be a high level I overview. Without doing anything extremely complicated (e.g. machine learning stuff) you have basically one option: pull down memes in batches, compare them to your "template image", and only save the ones which are similar enough. To pull down memes, you can either figure out the URL scheme for the memes and use straight requests, or figure out the URL scheme for the *pages* and "browse" the pages for images using BeautifulSoup. Then, to compare images, see e.g. this article: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/09/15/python-compare-two-images/
I agree. I used to be a little hesitant about the debugger since I knew nothing about it. One day, I spent over an hour trying to fix a weird bug in C++ and remembered a professor's tip about the debugger in Visual Studio. Fired it up, and found the bug in under a minute. After that, I was hooked. Debuggers FTW.
Which is why you learn enough of another language or two to provide some job security.
import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
Specific to Python, I found a lot of the content in [Effective Python](https://effectivepython.com/) to be really useful. Not necessarily just one-liners, but faster or cleaner ways of writing Python overall.

This is my story. Just that i am currently in my final year at the Busines School.
Or there is way more than sufficient logging and you don't want to wade through several hundred lines of logs that all use similar words and there are multiple threads so things end up in word order. Or your test suite/runner doesn't work great with pdb. Or the code was written by several hundred people across scores of competing companies and you are amazed it works at all, but it doesn't right now and you really just need to find out if this one line really is getting hit and you just don't quite trust what the decided is telling you. 😋
No, just show up to the room and hope there is space.
I an finally digging into machine learning!
Nice! I really love tools like this. I've been using [python-hunter](https://github.com/ionelmc/python-hunter) for a few months, which does essentially the same thing. A few things that it has: * enable using environment variable - no need to change any code in order to enable tracing * tracing can be filtered based on things like function name, module name, file, line number, etc * you can pick different actions - instead of tracing you can start a debugger for example (again, this doesn't require any code change, you can set it up with an environment variable) I have used this with remote debugging as well - when I had a daemon process that wasn't attached to a console I was able to get it to attach to pycharm using pydev when it hit a certain condition on a certain file/line.
Thanks for sharing, looks pretty useful.
There are tons of pre-existing tools to do this. Pyznap is one, but Google zfs snapshot backups and there are several popular options that include remotely shipping snapshots.
Or just `breakpoint()` in Python 3.7.
The default start of any of my scripts is: import logging logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) Use anywhere in code with `logger.debug` or `warning`, `info`, `error`, `critical`, `fatal`, `exception`. If you just want to debug and don't care to configure then just call `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)` at startup. Every other feature is optional but now that you're using logging in your code you don't need to make any changes to your code or habits in order to use them.
Agreed. There is [pdbpp](https://github.com/antocuni/pdb) and [pydev](https://github.com/fabioz/PyDev.Debugger/) but for nontrivial applications (using e.g. multiprocessing, daemons, multiple threads, asyncio) it can still be hard to work with.
Found the [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language\)) programmer.
**APL (programming language)** APL (named after the book A Programming Language) is a programming language developed in the 1960s by Kenneth E. Iverson. Its central datatype is the multidimensional array. It uses a large range of special graphic symbols to represent most functions and operators, leading to very concise code. It has been an important influence on the development of concept modeling, spreadsheets, functional programming, and computer math packages. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

DepHell doesn't try to replace your favorite tools. It extends them. It allows you to have smart resolver in pipenv, converting in setup.py for poetry, smart lockfile for pip, install projects in any format without having poetry/pipenv/etc on your system. And also it makes much other cool things like download stat for package, licenses overview, outdated packages check. None of existing tools can do it.
That's really pretty. One of the possible downsides of tools like this is you may end up with a lot of textual information and now you need more tools to parse it and put it in context. Birdseye seems like it wouldn't have that problem. The IDE integration is cool too.
Try `pip install hunter` then `PYTHONHUNTER='' python enterprise_code.py`.
DepHell's config isn't replacement for any existing format, it just shortcut for dephell commands that you want to perform every day. DepHell isn't replacement for setuptools or virtualenv. Dephell helps you to manage them better. Also, dephell makes much cool things like download stat and security audit.
Different situations call for different tools. I had an issue with a library that occurs on the CI server but not locally - and I don't have access to the CI server to attach a debugger. Something like this might help but using a debugger is impossible. Likewise for situations where e.g. stopping at a breakpoint will change things. Just look at the other comments in this thread for examples.
[`hunter`](https://github.com/ionelmc/python-hunter) lets you filter what gets traced based on file, line number, module name, function name, etc
`return 10 in (a, b, a + b)` :)
You might be interested in /r/FreeCAD (https://www.freecadweb.org) which has a C++ core and Python scripting with an interpreter built-in. It also has integration with other FOSS engineering tools to enable advanced applications like finite element analysis &amp; computational fluid dynamics. We (I'm a dev/admin for the project) also participate in Google Summer of Code so if you're a university student you can get paid to work on it, although it's too late for this year.
Not sure how sensitive those secrets are but just do you know they are in plain text. Maybe do a -f commit to remove them if they are sensitive.
Doubtless 'll get shot down, but, not knowing the context in which we are working, I like their solution as, seems to me, the odds of either 'b or 'a being == 10 are more likely than 'a + 'b being == 10. Yeah? In Python, this kind of logic is fail-fast, right? So getting 'a and 'b out of the way first would cut away ifs and elses and drop sums. Seems succulent and efficient.
I recommend Think Python 2e from [https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) which teaches Python 3 in a structured way including programming concepts. In general you need a good code editor and (the free version of) PyCharm by JetBrains is great. There is some learning curve but after about 2 weeks it becomes natural. At some point it is very important to get super-familiar with the built-in Python data structures (List, Dictionary, Classes, Iterators, etc.) because knowing them cuts down on the time needed for implementing an algorithm a lot. Good luck !!
Typically freelance developer or contract jobs. Building the resume after learning the skill opens the good jobs. I've heard web developer is the most wanted but also the highest stress... So... Flask and Django skills should be the fallback... Or a wig to hide baldness... But the above is what I was told by an instructor and my, well, agency... And Senior developers.

Still on 3.4.3, but that's one of the main features that I'm excited about after I eventually upgrade.
Good book
Why not just return( a+b == 10)
Does this file run on Python 3.xx ?
This is helpful, and makes me less _disinclined_ to use the `logging` module. That said, most of the stuff I work on doesn't even need log levels, so I'll still be selective about when I use these tools.
Debuggers are cracking software, not writing code. Logging is for lumberjacks.
Yes, you are correct. It does not print anything once the http server has been started. Is there any way to execute anything once the forever call is invoked?
Your program cant fail tests if you dont write them.
No one gets hired just for Python. It might open doors to discuss your other qualifications.
I like `staticmethod` for small helper functions that aren't really useful outside of a class. Also `@classmethod` for alternate constructors.
Yeah! Something like @q.tc
I’m not sure if it was just for example, but class is a keyword in python. Try renaming your class to import and see if that works!
Nice. Thanks.
Seems to be python 2.7
Damn that was great. Kuddo for this article because I was looking at lambda last week and I was wondering why would anyone need this. Now it's clearer.
It literally called "[logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html)".
Sounds about right 😁
Whatever you're doing is probably easier to achieve through pywin32 directly.
Tons of generally miserable advice in this thread, but I'd suggest learning some web-dev related skills. Often web shops are the most willing to take on junior staff because webapps are relatively common needs &amp; you can ramp up people on that easier than something like machine learning etc. Web: I'd recommend learning to make a simple API with something like Flask or Django &amp; Django Rest Framework. Databases: Learn to do a little bit with databases. Django ORM works fine for this, SQLAlchemy works as well. You can &amp; should learn SQL specifically eventually, but just getting familiar with one or both of those can get you up and running reasonably. Junior style work: Sometimes you can get into a place doing stuff like integrations &amp; scripting, so I'd learn some basics around things like the requests library just so you're able to do some simple scripting and hitting another endpoint. Alternatively, learning some test automation &amp; getting some practice writing tests is worthwhile. As for what you want to do to ramp up in experience, you're gonna want a place that has some senior devs who can mentor. If they do code review etc. that'll help a lot in getting real feedback for improvement etc.
On Pythonista I get the following error: &gt;&gt;&gt; import pysnooper Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;string&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; File "/private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/3C95652F-7A7F-4900-A9A6-0C2F0BE6ADB7/Pythonista3/Documents/site-packages/pysnooper/__init__.py", line 4, in &lt;module&gt; import future.standard_library ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'future' Any ideas?
Looks like you didn't run \`pip install pysnooper\` which would have installed the dependencies.
got it :)
I did. Maybe I should have put more info in my comment, but I actually tried to fix the problem myself by running `pip install future`. Because I’m using Python 3, I got an error upon starting up Pythonista, saying that that package should not be accessible.
I will also note that it's running on the FIFE engine which is written in C++ on top of Qt, but it was pieced together in Python.
FYI: This is a re-post since LearnPython removed it.
Huh. I don't know then, sorry.
I recommend the book "automate the boring stuff" helped me alot
Yup, that is the book I started on! It's a brilliant book.
Where did you read that? Because I heard that as well, but I heard that it was an old comment, before a lot of community work went into it.
I try to run on python 2.7 but some error

I don't buy it. There's MS-only or Java-only shops, but people there shouldn't be ignorant enough to not acknowledge the existence of other languages outside their company. There's a wide array of embedded and similar close-to-metal fields, but they use scripting for glue and automation. Who can be that detached? In what specific field?

Wow I'll actually love using this. Thanks OP!
BI is Business Intelligence?
You can start learning in R, and then rewrite the R codes on python. Like this you learn 2 languages, and get the desired result at the same time. This is always very practical to rewrite codes from one programming language to another. This is what most people highly recommend to do with octave materials by Andrew Ng for machine learning - to rewrite it for python.
So, in my case: c:\users\name\appdata\local\programs\python\python36\scripts\spyder3.exe, jupyter.exe etc. Hope that helps :-)
All of those applications are also Python modules. I guess Anaconda runs them with `pythonw.exe -m some_module_name` then.
I remember him saying this in one of his videos. People had asked him about how he made his videos and he open sourced his tools a while ago.
It's more like Anno-series than age-series. None the less it looks cool :)
I'm not 100% sure if it was on the original CD or on a copy, I just knew that my anti virus program picked out the Roallertoaster.exe when I inserted the CD. But that's 10 Years ago :)
Yeah it's cool to see games being made to this level written in Python. It's rare. This game has been around for a while, it just never got any attention.

Yeah. What error do you have?
Yeah. What error do you have?
We are currently in the process to create a python codebase, that -I imagine- will become sprawling and cancerous over time as everything a huge enterprise does.
When it suggests you upgrade, just do it and thank me later.
What year is it?
Thank you both! I'll check it out.
Thanks, I'll check it out.
Thanks, I'll check it out.

1-2 years ago I heard about [Python Anywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) as the best of the kind, but I don't know if it's exactly what you need and if it still is that good.
But i recommend “python crash course” as a first one. There is more information about language structure etc
If you've already done some programming I really found Dive into Python useful. It was on github for free, but something got messed up with the official repository, so another guy decided to host the latest version of the book he got [HERE](http://diveintopython3.problemsolving.io/)
Y
I started tinkering with it before I asked the question. I got so frustrated so quickly, I figured Reddit would be good for alternative ideas. It might still be good, but I don't know how much documentation I'd have to read to find out.
What would you consider "just learned the basics"?
I understand. Usually I prefer a cheap VPS somewhere and develop there, using a Docker Container for what I'll do and GitHub or GitLab for the code. That way, I can always develop in any computer, anywhere. I just need to deploy the code after, or use a script, Jenkins or GitLab CI to auto deploy.
Judging by OPs post history and yours, I’m gonna have to say no to that.
I had to screenshot this exchange. Simply marvelous!
this looks great.
I'm looking for simple to start. I'm new to Python.
# HOYO HOYO
Is highly recommended them for people who _dont_ like maths. He's really fantastic at explaining and visualising quite abstract concepts that many people struggle with
Cool! Really need to get back into some projects but just struggle to find the time lately. Will definitely try this out when I get chance. Thanks for sharing!!
I would argue that you need to run your CI in a container to replicate the issue locally, and if your CI doesn’t offer that, then it’s time to get a new CI.
&gt;And its a lot of fun, too, so dont be afraid... You, referring to programming in python &gt;makes building and training neutral networks in python very easy...Have fun You again, telling someone to have fun programming in python. But why the fuck would anyone make a game for fun though right?
We are getting to the point that we have tools to manage tools to manage tools.
Python is amazing for network engineering and sys admins looking to add some automation to their workflow. Tools like ansible typically do not require an extensive knowledge of the language and allows a pure network engineer / sys admin to work at scale. so if you also have knowledge in networking or sysadmin this could be a starting point to advertise yourself. Another solution is to build automation tools yourself using backend Apis in python for instance . Its not a real job per se, its rather a mission or an aspect of python development applied to automation. It's my current job in a bank ( I'm still a student in master) and it requires good sys admin base (unix systems), and other bits of knowledge like a bit of networking a bit of database etc. I'm still in training so take this with a grain of salt but from my POV it seems that Python is often used as a toolbox to serve or empower an existing concept rather than as a unique standalone solution to a problem. Might be because it's interpreted and easy to learn but all I see is python for automation, python for backend api and python applied to mathematics or machine learning.
Pretty awesome! I just saw this in the repo lol ``` def redirect(stdin='/dev/null', stdout='/dev/null', stderr='/dev/null'): """ TODO: No clue what this is about. """ ```
It looks more like the Anno series than the Age of Empires series tbh
Talk to a COBOL programmer or even a FORTRAN programmer. The attitude and focus on thief world is common. There are a vast number of niches out there that don’t know about or care to know about Python. I wouldn’t call it detached but rather focused. Consider the field of medicin as a similar situation, lots of GP’s out there but also specialist highly focused on their niche. These specialist have no idea how to handle the flue.
Yeah someone else pointed that out too lol. I never played Anno series but I looked it up and I agree. Edited my main comment here to reflect that. I kinda wanna play Anno now it looks cool.
lol nice
It's an _extremely_ non-specific question. "Harder to maintain" is almost entirely subjective and depends on your team and your skills and your application and your goals and like five million other things.
Please fix the formatting, this is absolutely unreadable (and too long for anyone to make an effort fixing it for you). Note that triple backticks don't work on reddit, you have to indent 4 spaces. Also note that asking this kind of "help me with my programming problem" questions here is generally frowned upon; /r/learnpython might be a better fit.
I make extensive use of the typing module, mypy, type annotations, NewTypes etc, it's certainly not frowned upon by me! If nothing else, forcing you to do something sensible with Optional types makes a huge difference in code quality!
I doubt it. There’s of course that ancient banking infrastructure, but what you said only applies if those devs have no contact whatsoever with the more 21st century parts of the bank’s IT infrastructure or larger dev world. And if they don’t, how can they comment on any property of that world?
My company upgraded from ubuntu 14.04 to 18.04, sadly 3.6 :( but now I can use async await on some of our software. Maybe I should add pyenv and 3.7 to our deployment routine and switch our development machines to 3.7 as well. Ansible will use pre-installed 3.6 and our virtual envs will utilize 3.7
It makes sitting in lecture looking at a blackboard a rip-off.
I was against this game, but your comment converted me. Looks great!
Thanks for this.
Yes, use the [subprocess.call](https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.call) for that and your args probably should be \["python", "-m", "SimpleHTTPServer"\].
Short answer: Kinda.. Long answer: Depends on a million different things...
Break up the codebase. Any monolith is going to become a maintenance nightmare. If you break up the sum into parts and have good interfaces (REST or language-direct depending on circumstance) between them (with contracts, or types, or something enforcing the interface) then you'll be OK.
Anything you can do in R you can (relatively) do in python. R being a domain specific language for statistics will have some benefits in some use cases, as well as the reverse. What are you trying to do or get into? Insurance analytics is a pretty generic statement. That can range from more typical data analysis to actuarial survival models.
You know that's not fool-proof. And if it doesn't work then you're left with the hundreds or thousands of things that could still be different. Kernel parameters, container runtime, device characteristics. Wouldn't it be nice to set an environment variable and get line-by-line traces of what the code is doing, then just compare a good run and a bad run? In my case I already had logs, I didn't need this tool, and it was my code at fault. If the issue was in another library (like the standard library, for example), something like this tool would be useful.
Here is the crate: https://docs.rs/inline-python/0.2.0/inline_python/

You can set `ansible_python_interpreter` to point to whatever you want. You could add newer Python to the base machine image or have one role that just does the Python installation so all others can assume the latest is being used.
One complaint I have about the standard logging library is the lack of granularity below warning. I wish they had one or two more named functions (details, internal) that we could use without requiring a separate library everywhere.
Would you be open to feedback on your code? &amp;#x200B; Just saw somethings that really stood out to me that I am sure you probably already know but if not would love to bring attention to. &amp;#x200B; e.g. &amp;#x200B; \`base\_url = "[https://api.pushshift.io/reddit/comment/search/?author={}&amp;sort=desc&amp;sort\_type=created\_utc&amp;size=500](https://api.pushshift.io/reddit/comment/search/?author={}&amp;sort=desc&amp;sort_type=created_utc&amp;size=500)".format(username)\` I wouldn't personally format url strings like this and instead use the request library and the url builder there. e.g. \`requests.get(url, params={insert your params here})\`
2 real life examples : \- Dropbox is (was?) entirely developed in Python (dynamically-typed). They developed mypy to help them maintain, debug and develop their source code. \- Facebook is (was?) entirely developed in PHP (dynamically-typed). They developed Hack (a language that add types to PHP...) to help them maintain, debug, optimize and develop their source code. &amp;#x200B; Note that these projects (Hack and Mypy) were created after these companies have millions of users. &amp;#x200B; These 2 examples is exactly what I think : start with python to develop fast your first features. When you feel limited by the language, choose something that suits perfectly your need (you want to be fast? To be secure? To reduce the maintenance burden? To hire easily new talents?).
If I had to write half the Python libraries I use myself then I would always have a "large codebase". Your question does not address the attitude of the developer community in solving problems. Python has a lot of libraries that can be combined to solve problems whilst keeping what you write yourself down to more manageable size.
lol
This week was one of the first I got really annoyed with python. I needed to write a graph based program with some functionality to make updates in a document data store and do some math and I found the lack of types to be very inconvenient. I ended up using type hints everywhere, but I would have preferred to have actually types instead.
Blockchain is an irresponsible use of resources. I have yet to see an that wouldn't do better without block chain. Very few things in this world needs a cryptographical secure immutable chain of documents.
Python can be typed, so it’s not a valid argument.
The one thing I don't like with the python `logging` module is that it filters log events after being called so some logger.level()... calls can become rather expensive if there is a lot of string formatting or even database lookups involved even if the line just thrown away. I've created some external conditions modules in projects to have something like ``` if log.user(user_id) or log.trace_request(): logger.info("....") ``` The logging module is kind of flexible though, you probably don't need more than something like this inside your projects logging config to create a new level in place: https://stackoverflow.com/a/22586200
The python library which makes python "like R" is called pandas. Check out some docs: http://pandas.pydata.org
Thanks for the great post. I am new to python and I am working through the exercises on [https://www.learnpython.org/](https://www.learnpython.org/) I have to write code and have an end goal or purpose in mind to actually learn something.
You can use literally anything as a personal project. Don't feel pressured to make something large and complex. Almost all large projects have a huge amount of work over many years poured into them and comparing yourself to them is just setting yourself up for failure. A good starting place would be to complete code challenges like https://projecteuler.net/ and upload those to github. Project Euler is more math heavy than others so it may be more related to your field. Speaking from the position of someone that has interviewed software engineers having anything is better than nothing. You would be surprised how many professional level programmers have no public code samples. Don't stress if a project is too easy or not, complexity will come naturally with time as you learn. You can upload your code to https://github.com/ for free. Its the de-facto way of publicly sharing code. I use it for all of my personal projects. It will also force you to learn git which is invaluable for collaborating on programming projects and also deserves a place on your resume.
I'm new to python. I'm making a snake game. Got everything done apart from an annoying bug that seems to mean I have to redo how the player class works. Yay
My 320k line package has no memory leaks because python doesn’t leak memory (it has GC issues, but those aren’t leaks). Can you say that about your C++ program? Keep in mind that C++ programs are 3 or more times longer than an equivalent python program, so that 320k lines is now 1M lines in C++. Yes, there are bugs that could be caught by static analysis, but that’s why I write tests and put assert statements to type check specific functions. I need those tests anyways as they help to define the API and to make refactoring safer. On a 320k lined package, the coverage is 74% and runs every build in 9 minutes. I have 40k additional problems that take about 5 hours to run.
To me, there are around 100 things that are more important for the maintainability of a code base than static type checking. Just to name a few: * tests * documentation * spliting code into logical, smaller, maintainable segments responsible for a certain tasks and being able to tests those smaller segments independently * consistent formatting * physical layout of the source code files and directories
No problem :)
If the images are the same size and from the same base image you could cv2 template search them for a static piece of the image, like the CNN logo. With some clever cropping and averaging you could figure it out that way as well. You could also do some sort of blob detection on the shape of the frog. Of course the fun way would be to do some image classification with machine learning. =) Lots of ways to do this, hope you enjoy cv2 and numpy.
If it's on the start menu you can click something (right click?) to edit the start menu or shortcut, and that will tell you where the binary is.
I tried this but it did not work. I also tried using subprocess.Popen( \["python", "-m", "SimpleHTTPServer"\]), this actually fetches the ps1 script in remote machine using invoke-expression but the gives this error: Exception calling "DownloadString" with "1" argument(s): "The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a receive." &amp;#x200B; My command: "powershell iex ((new-object system.net.webclient).downloadstring('http://ip-add:8000/test.ps1'))"
You should check out structlog, it allows for the passing of kwargs into the logging function for easier variable dumping. It's drop in and will work with your existing logging configs. https://www.structlog.org/en/stable/ from structlog import get_logger logger = get_logger(__name__) def some_function(): # later then: logger.error("user did something", something="shot_in_foot") # gives you: # event='user did something' request_id='ffcdc44f-b952-4b5f-95e6-0f1f3a9ee5fd' something='shot_in_foot'
There is a new one by No Starch called *Python Crash Course*. That one is very god also.
Thanks
I can't help you with that if your server is up and running (test it with for example `curl` [`0.0.0.0:8000`](https://0.0.0.0:8000) or with your server's actual IP).
Yep
Hey, I've been digging into Tweepy for a couple of days now. Glad that you've shared your awesome work. The question that bugs me a lot is that I struggle to figure out a way to make the bot auto-reply to mentions and received replies all targeted at itself. Will setting the id to the bot itself work in this case?
I brought unit test coverage of my project to 100%. Wasn't a trivial task, but it's nice to have it done in the end! [aiomixcloud](https://github.com/amikrop/aiomixcloud)
[removed]
Looks more like ANNO.
Yeah I hear you. In C++ and similar with macros we can replace logging statements with `if` statements so no formatting or argument evaluation is done unless required. It's nice to just get that for free and then only in the really hot paths do we need to be concerned with logging, using it liberally pretty much everywhere else. And thanks, maybe it's not such a big deal - I just need to put it into a utility library and use it or live without it, no point wanting with no action.
Nice job with this! I will be using this. saved.
I'm starting the PyCharm Edu Version Intro tutorials. Started on objects and classes yesterday want to get through that set of lessons tonight. &amp;#x200B; Got long term ambitions of learning to make little CV systems for home and work. Like tell me where I left my pencil or does this object pass these visual inspections.
It's a great game. You have to love strategy games though because you'll spend much more time balancing taxes vs expenses and keeping your people happy with gradual improvements, dealing with natural disaster etc.. then you will waging wars. You get to do that too but not until you've put a lot of effort into it.
If you’re looking for an open-source Age of Empires, check out [0 A.D.](https://play0ad.com/) They are probably the most developed project in that space.
but muh buzzwords!
Yes. It was an honest question because your request does not make sense. Some people use scrappers to get around some limitations (such as rate limits) of the Twitter API. But Twitter does not want you to do that. My suggestion is you not look for a Twitter scrapper. They don't work with the API for, I hope, obvious reasons. If you want to use the API you first need to pick your language. Then google "twitter api libraries". The first result will take to Twitter's list of recommended third-party libraries.
More progress on a project that was in hibernation for a while: Aki, a simple programming language that uses Python and the `llvmlite` library. * GitHub: https://github.com/syegulalp/Akilang * Official blog (still minimal): http://aki.genjipress.com * Quick demo movie (outdated but fun -- this was from the original incarnation of the project) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vZ4oFCFOl8 Just added a C array type, and am in the middle of reworking how some of the type descriptors work (that part is somewhat messy right now). I hope to be able to have the old Conway's Life demo up and running again, if with some clunkiness, by the time PyCon Cleveland rolls around.
Thank you very much for the feedback! I agree with your suggestion and have just implemented and tested it. The code looks cleaner now. :)
I have updated my Reddit bot that generates comments with Markov chains. Now the comments are *context-aware*, the results are more hilarious and a bit more natural. Full commented code and detailed article on the following link: https://github.com/PhantomInsights/comments-generator
There is no direct correlation between a language being dynamically typed and how easy/hard it is to maintain a large project. Things that DO matter: \- How easy is this code to read? (Especially after you haven't looked at it in a while) \- How easy is this code to test? \- How easy is this code to modify and the whole application still work correctly? Python excels at all of the above, much more so (in my experience) than Java, C, C++. That's not to say that you can't write large codebases in those languages that are easy to maintain or that you couldn't have a python codebase that is hard to maintain. Static type checking isn't going to make a codebase more maintainable.
Do you have the same for illustrators?
1. /r/learnpython 2. You can use the `input` function to read a value from the user.
i don’t think you understand...
Then please explain.
if i have 2 users, i want to do some processes with each user but i can’t do both at the same time so, instead of just doing what is default, instead i want to ask the users ie input(“who wants to go first”) . then how do i decide who goes first?
`input` will give you a string, something like `"user 1"`. You can then use an if-statement, like `if who_goes_first == "user 1"` to determine what happens next.
Read the sidebar.
wdym?
Not yet. However, we are planning to continue this series of articles and there will probably be one devoted to data scientists.
Is it like and RTS or a City building simulation?

And Python shall conquer all! I think what's interesting is that there are two clumps of languages: One that is more used and one that is less so. This gets pronounced around Aug 2010 and goes until Apr 2017 where it's javascript/python/java/php/c#. Today, it's much more of a curve though.
wanted to see how someone else would interpret this but okai
You've got the perfect solution for your problem twice in this thread and you downvoted both solutions- it's not okay, but okay.
Actually I think it depends on how you structure your code. It can be really hard to maintain the codebase in any language, if you don't have a good structure and a real plan (always plan it out first or you rewrite it several times later). You generally want to have as few lines of code as possible in functions and group them with separate classes. (It's no fun searching for bugs in 10k+ lines of code). The best way would be to create separate modules/folders for each part of your code. Btw. always comment your damn code!

1. /r/learnpython 2. You don't need to memorize every function in the language - as long as you understand the basic concepts, you should be to look things up in the documentation is needed. In what situations are you feeling that you "just have to memorize" things?
Radio Paradise is an excellent internet station, completely listener supported so no ads
Thanks for the heads up but it's not that sensitive
&gt; /r/learnpython Gah. Noted, thanks. Will upload there for future queries. &gt; as long as you understand the basic concepts, you should be to look things up in the documentation is needed I guess one thing I'm struggling with is, when presented with 100 different concepts, how to distinguish the basic-and-thus-essential ones from the fancier, more niche, less essential ones. NB I'm also pretty new to programming in general, so am not coming to Python with much in the way of general coding knowledge. &gt; In what situations are you feeling that you "just have to memorize" things? Given the low base I'm starting from, almost every situation haha. But more helpfully, I feel especially overwhelmed when - in Jupyter Notebook - I type a function (e.g., pd.DataFrame()), hit tab, and see that popup with like 250 different methods (right term?), all belonging to that specific function (I think). Or within a function, I open the manual to read about it, and see that it has 25 different parameters I can assign if needed. The amount of detail just feels too much. Again, I just don't know how to separate the useful functions/options from the less useful ones. I understand that all of them are useful in certain scenarios, but I'd imagine that proficient coders already know which ones matter for their purposes. But I don't know how to acquire that knowledge in an efficient manner. Does that make sense?
It is written in 3.7, but requires certain libraries to be installed (all can be pip installed though so it's easy)
This is a great article. Thanks a lot for sharing. Upvoted 🙂 ^ |
If I were you, I wouldn't start from the docs - start with something you actually want to build, and then use the docs and Google to find specific things that will get you there.
then use R...
Thank you for that!
1. /r/learnpython 2. Read the error it gives you.
Thanks :)
No, because this class is in Python.
Thanks :)
I did read it. And I tried to reshape it it I still get the dumb 2d 1d error.
How did you try to reshape it? Post your code.
why is /u/android_tank so dumb, like how hard is it to use the right tool for the job?
If you don’t mind what class is this ? I start a class in a couple weeks with python and Algebra
&gt; In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. The regression algorithm is designed to work on X values that are vectors. It has no way to tell whether your 1-D array is a single 4473-dimensional vector or an array of 4473 scalar samples. To express that your X values are separate scalar samples, you will need to pass an array of shape `(4473, 1)`. You can do this with `x.reshape(-1, 1)` as the error message suggests.
Yeah for sure, you can't learn and retain this stuff in the abstract. I'm learning Python for work, where I'm tasked with basic data analysis. So I already have my use cases ready to go. As for your "as long as you understand the basic concepts" comment... 1. what would you consider the basic concepts to be? 2. How can I figure that out on my own? 3. Does what's basic vary by context? e.g., whether I'm doing data analysis vs. developing games vs. creating intelligent algorithms
I just did x.reshape(1,-1) like it said. That didn't work. So I tried x.reshape(-1,1). That also didn't work. I did the same thing to y as well.
This, because reshapes don't happen in place, so if you have a = np.arange(0,6) a.reshape((2,3)) A is still still the same after that second expression is evaluates, you'd have to do a = a.reshape((2,3))
The basic concepts are pretty much just what a class is, what a function is, how to call a method on a class, etc. - the stuff you need to be able to read the documentation. If you know those things, you can just start searching - in a Google way, not in a textbook way - the documentation for specific solutions to your problems.
Post the exact program, and check /u/alecgirman's comment as well - I feel like this is your problem.
No need to be a jerk.
there's a couple billion subreddits. I came in to this subreddit, read the sidebar. didn't see any rules, then posted. not gonna scour entire reddit for all the billions of subreddits to find the right one.
At first I honestly thought this was something that was cool, but completely useless. After seeing that you can use major libraries like matplotlib then this suddenly became very very interesting. I could see a ton of use cases for doing some data analysis in some numpy/scipy/sklearn and graphing it with matplotlib/seaborn/plotly. &amp;#x200B; Very interested in how this moves forward!
Python is made for general purpose programming, not specifically for mathematics. That means you have to put some effort into learning how Python works before you can be effective in it. It's not dumb, it's just not tailor-made for your particular use case.
In my spare time.... I have been learning webscraping with BeautifulSoup. Scraping webpages for weather reports doesn't make practical sense with Environment Canada because they provide hourly xml reports for anyone wanting to build an app. But I have been wanting to learn for a while and this seemed like a good way to do it. I have put up a project if anyone is interested. Contributions are always welcome. It is a learning project only and I would like to expand it with other countries as well. https://github.com/alaudet/my_weather
Hrm, only mentions TDD, general testing doesn't even make it on the list. And then managers wonder why their projects break all the time..
I'm surprised Git and SQL are not higher on the list. They are critical.
Django is fine, Flask is also fine, if you want async, look into aiohttp, Quart, Starlette or Responder.
Good stuff. Thanks for the input!
I figured it out. I tried the reshape again, but commented out the code after that line and then uncommented the code after the line and it worked. Guess it doesn't work if all my code doesn't work
It's a finance class so it's already annoying that most of my time spent on the class is figuring out PYTHON and not learning finance
What do you mean by that exactly? Can you post your program in its entirety, preferably the versions before and after you changed things to make it work?
I also think there's another consideration when "hard to maintain" is presented. In some aspects, does the language itself allow you to organize large code bases, and do the dependencies between files and the organizational structure allow one to easily fix broken components with changing future needs. I think python is not the top of the pack here. But, consider also, is Python a language you see being developed now, in the future, 5, 10 20 years? And are there qualified people who will be knowledgeable about the quirks and tools that consist of the core of your code base? Definitely. So on the one hand, it might be pure speculative about the language, but the other, it's speculative about the people and culture that exists around it. I don't think Fortran or Cobol ever had the presence Python has.
You need to escape your `[` character. Also, that still won't work, because it's a list and not a string with square brackets in it. Also, /r/learnpython.
Or django-channels... :)
I tried \\\[ still its not working bro. Can your explain in detail pls.
TRY ONE ouREG = LinearRegression() #RUN REGRESSION; .fit(x values, y values) ouREG.fit(x, y) GOT ERROR ----------- TRY TWO ouREG = LinearRegression() #RUN REGRESSION; .fit(x values, y values) x = x.reshape(-1,1) y = x.reshape(-1,1) ouREG.fit(x, y) GOT SAME ERROR ------------ TRY THREE ouREG = LinearRegression() #RUN REGRESSION; .fit(x values, y values) x = x.reshape(-1,1) y = x.reshape(-1,1) #ouREG.fit(x, y) NO ERROR ---------- TRY FOUR ouREG = LinearRegression() #RUN REGRESSION; .fit(x values, y values) x = x.reshape(-1,1) y = x.reshape(-1,1) ouREG.fit(x, y) NO ERROR
Yeah, that explains it. You were doing `y = x.reshape(-1, 1)`, setting the value of `y` to a reshaped `x`.
`elements` is not a string, it's a list with one element.
This works fine on Linux? Have been looking for an alternative to 0 A. D. which hangs a lot.
Yeah im getting bro. Is there any work around ??? Any way to remove the words
What are you actually trying to _achieve_?
I think it’s a wonderful way to get acquainted with web-scraping. I did the same thing for our website; I built a web-scraper to get all items without images from our store where I could’ve done it with a SQL Query, but the opportunity to get real world experience when you know you have a goal you want to accomplish is great. :)
tests: pytest, et al. documention: __doc__ strings, etc, it's built into the language code splitting: you modulize by __init__.py &amp; folders, or make a true module with a setup.py. I think the biggest issue we run into is circular imports consistent formatting: hello white space physical layout: probably the same as splitting code
That actually worked, it's the ocmmenting out that didn't work. BUt htanks for catching that error
Thank you!
Learning purpose. Just want to remove the div tag bro i tried a lot cant make it work thats why posted in reddit.
Why is /u/mudclub so dumb, like how hard is it to not be a jerk?
So do you just want to get the contents of the `div` tag? If so, you probably want `elements[0]` to access the tag itself, and then `elements[0].children` to get a list of its children.
Working on a networkx project where I've modelled a small spatial network. Now I'm calculating centralities and have been thinking of comparing my network with erdos-renyi and small-world networks. Currently it's a private repository. When it's done I'll probably share it here :)
Thanks, I can read and study, but I really need to screw things up and get dirty to learn... :-)
Amen man. I like to read, copy and paste some code, and the. Repurpose it to meet my needs, tweaking things as I go to really learn what everything does (along with the docs) and then I rewrite a v2 nice and clean and efficiently! If you haven’t, look into headless scraping, it can improve your speeds a ton, and then you can schedule jobs on a server to run automatically with no GUI!
Interesting insights! Thanks for sharing 🤙🏻

As an outsider, what's the problem with circular imports?
I'm still trying to figure out this keyboard issue i'm having with gtk3. [This post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/beavs5/editing_one_widget_from_another_in_gtk3/) I've kind of backed away from it the last week to do other things, but I'd like to figure it out sooner rather than later.
The answer will depend on what the person you ask the question to. Oracle would tell you yes.
Personal opinion / experience: you can develop / maintain larger code bases in Python, but this might require to change some habits: \- testing should be practiced anyway but becomes more important \- test coverage together with static checkers like pyflakes helps. \- I like defensive programming, like asserts on function arguments types or values \- external checkers like mypy or type hint analysis in PyCharm can be very usefull, although extensive type hinting can turn readable code very unreadable.
It's a broken attempt at self-daemonizing, which is one of those things that you should *never* do. At the very least, use `start-stop-daemon` with at least `-b`, `-m`, and `-p`. But even that is suboptimal.
I'm trying to figure out how to create a json-File of a nested python object and how to deserialize a json into a nested python object. Seems like there are many ways, but I'm struggling to see which one might be the most pythonic and easiest.
I think knowledge of GIT and basics of SQL are implicit when you're looking for a Python dev. I wouldn't really drop that as a requirement.
dude i am have some problem in your application
Any idea how these animations were made? It looks neat
It depends on the architecture. You can build something very large using microservices and containers regardless of language. Also for a monolithic application using something like Clean Architecture, or the conventions in a framework (like django) will help you a lot from writing yourself too much into a corner. I think a lot of average c++ programmers are better coders than average Python programmers due to the complexity of their tools. However a good coder in C++ is not necessarily a better coder than a good coder in Python. And the Python coder will almost invariably be a lot more productive.
What about `&amp;`?
- a powerful research and note taking tool - an obd2 automotive diagnostic scanner - an rfid-based vending machine
Thats exactly it. It's so basic, some companies don't even think to put it in the job description.

Dropbox has some go code, but is still almost entirely Python. Even their client (On the order of a few million lines AFAIK) is in Python (now Python 3!). Their server code base is also millions of lines of code. Facebook also has millions of lines of Python code in use, and like tens of millions of lines of hack.

For how many years in a row is VBA the least popular language? 🤔
The new one just came out (1800) and 2070 is also solid, I can definitely recommend
I agree with the other commenters, it all depends. One of my clients has a large Python code base (300k lines) with virtually zero issues (issues from dynamic typing that is 😉). Another client has an app with 2k - 3k lines that is hell to keep running.
Hi Michael! I feel like you've probably seen [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/bfyt16/hiring_100perhour_is_looking_for_djangoreactetc/), but I linked it just in case. He mentions that he's looking for devs who have contributed to the Django ecosystem in some way, and after browsing your github a little I would say you fit that description. I hope all goes well, brother!
"Popularity" on Stack Overflow is hardly a measure of actual popularity or usage. It's a measure of which languages people end up with the most problems with/questions about, and very largely influenced by college students.

You don't really need to know the ins and outs of AWS to be a Python developer. However, Python is also heavily used for devops and sysadmin tasks. So in that case, of course you'll most likely need AWS experience. You can *absolutely* build web apps all day long and never touch AWS.

it's a poorly framed question that can't meaningfully be answered in the abstract. certainly you'll find many ideologues and partisans who insist that their favorite type system is totally necessary for maintaining whatever sort of code base they decide it should be used for. that doesn't make it true. the better question to ask is "what are type systems good at?" and "which type system is best suited for my project?" Python is strongly typed and has a lot of useful exception handling features. It's also dynamically "duck" typed which has some benefits and some weaknesses to it. What is strong typing good at? It's good at "crash early and often", meaning it tends to expose programming errors early in the development process before they can accidentally make it to production. What is dynamic "duck" typing good at? minimizing boiler plate and allowing just a handful of data structures (sequence types, mapping types, scalars, and callables) to handle the vast majority of your use cases by providing a uniform interface defined at the language level rather than the application code level. both of those features are good ways to increase developer productivity. what is strong typing bad at? doesn't handle failures gracefully unless you go out of your way to define exception handlers that can do that. there's no graceful degradation by default. this may or may not be a problem for your application though. what is dynamic "duck" typing bad at? it puts a limit on the usefulness of static analysis tools, and it also lets bad developers get away with things they probably shouldn't do. this puts more burden on your manual code review and automated testing, basically. in any case, this is just scratching the surface and I think the question can't be meaningfully answered by just talking about it. the only meaningful answers that can be given to it depend on knowing the full detail and scope of your technical requirements, your organizational structure and limitations, your budget, your availability of programmer talent, etc. any time you see someone on SO (or wherever) spouting off a strong opinion about type systems, take it with a huge grain of salt. a lot of this is driven by a kind of nerd sectarianism where some people, for reasons that escape me, have chosen to become zealous partisans and to bludgeon anyone within earshot with their strong opinions about type systems.
Give fastapi a try. Faster dev than flask for api backend
&gt; My 320k line package has no memory leaks because python doesn’t leak memory Memory leaks aren't a language feature, they are developer error.
That's honestly pretty true of any mature platform. It's pretty rare that you encounter a problem that has only been solved in Python.
Hack was developed primarily to improve runtime performance. The type hinting was kinda tacked on as a nice-to-have but that wasn't the motivating reason behind the project.
In a manually memory managed language (like C, or most C++ codebases) memory leaks are a very common developer error that pops up all the time because the language makes it easy to make that error. in an automatic memory managed/garbage collected language it's basically impossible to make that mistake (excepting some contrived examples). so I would say that yes, it is a language feature that causes memory leaks: manual memory management.
It's at least a decent picture I would think. Especially if uniqueness is factored into these numbers at all.

That is the whole point! They comment based upon their perspective in the world, what is happening in the rest of the world doesn’t matter. Of course there are other possible factor, insecurity being one of them. The thing here is that people can in fact be largely out of touch with the rest of the world. Yes that Means within their own organization.
I'm willing to evolve in terms of technologies, NOT in terms of roles and responsibilities!
It is still plenty easy to mess up in Python, or any other language. [See here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2017431) for a bunch of easy to make mistakes. It might not be *as easy* in Python compared to C, but Python certainly isn't immune by design.
I didn't know that. Thanks for the info!
I packaged a script I have been toying with for digital marketing attribution. I basically tried to recreate the markov-chain attribution library in R called ChannelAttribution but in Python. I'm not really a programmer as much as I am an analyst so the code is crap but it's been an awesome learning experience so far. First order markov chain sequences are covered. I need to rest my head a bit before trying to build higher orders into it. [https://github.com/jerednel/markov-chain-attribution](https://github.com/jerednel/markov-chain-attribution)
This can be simplified from Collections import Counter word_count_dict = Counter() for w in text.split(" "): word_count_dict[w]+=1 To this from collections import Counter word_count_dict = Counter(text.split())
sure, or you can fork 1000 interpreter instances with multiprocessing and have them running coroutines that don't terminate before they eat all the memory on your system too. or you can open a filehandle, read the entire thing into memory, and then never do anything with it and forget to close the file (assuming you also failed to use the with... context manager). there's plenty of ways to consume more memory than you intended to by negligence or by poor design decisions. that's still ridiculously different than needing to malloc and free every single buffer in your system.
CSV and the pickle module FTW.
Exactly. Yeah I wasn't trying to be hard on them. I saw that too lol. I was just stating a general thing.
Honestly, it comes down mostly to team practices. How has the team decided to modularize the code, broken it into packages, etc. Are there automated tests? CI/CD? These good practices go a long way towards making projects in most languages maintainable and scaling to large codebases. Often times there are other constraints that push you towards one language over another. What I will say Python makes way more challenging than it should is publishing your own packages internally and being able to include bring them in using pip. At least, last time I looked at it, it was harder than other languages. It's a little bit of a problem of Python being around so long that they have to retrofit new practices onto the core ecosystem, not because Python is bad or somehow lacking in an unfixable way. As far as the static type checker, I have been moving teams towards typed Python and everyone finds it really useful and unobtrusive.
60 fps should be OK
This is just buzzword bingo. I like how the third highest skill is "API." *Hey, what did you do to make that new project?* This time I took a risk and used API. It was great!
I guess it depends how pedantic you want to be about the definition.
PySimpleGUI can now be run in a web browser, in addition to tkinter, Qt, WxPython. It uses Remi as the underlying GUI. It's possible to write your GUI code once and run it on multiple GUI frameworks.
Excellent!
I went this route, although not particularly by design. I started out in IT doing reports on Oracle briefly then SQL Server (on old school Analysis Services/DTS) for a few years, then got a job loading data into SQL Server using Python. Now 13 years later I'm a full stack dev and still mostly using Python (and occasionally C#). Being able to write SQL efficiently and optimise queries has been really useful throughout my career as a lot of backend developers aren't actually very good at this, so it's not a bad way to start.
Is it multplayer?
Stop writing Python 2 code.

It's part of the thing that people want us to know. I personally hate OAuth2 and IAM systems, but it's apparently a necessary component for authentication for mobile applications, so I must learn it, unfortunately.
GC is handling the memory leaks. If the GC is getting called to much, then you have a memory leak. There was some talk that explained exactly how GC works in respects to memory leaks. I can be pretty bad in Powershell as well.
Its really quite annoying that the x-axis keeps on changing, it should be static and the bars move over time to show all time points in the same way.
You have the data in the correct format to plot for each year and save an image of each file, you then merge them into a gif (something like [imagemagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/) will do this) which can be converted to a video format with music ([ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) will do the conversion).
How would you run it from the command prompt? Something like this `C:\python\python.exe mycode.py`? Have you installed the `pypyodbc` module? `python -m pip install pypyodbc` should get it installed, if that doesn't work then `pip install pypyodbc`.
The easiest solution would probably be [ghost](https://ghost.org). But if you want to stick with Python, I'd look at [Pyramid](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid-blogr/en/latest/index.html) or [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com).
On the main menu it says multiplayer, but I'm not sure if it works. I clicked on it and it told me to install pyenet, which I did through pip install, and it didn't work. Maybe I used the wrong version of pyenet or something. It has instructions to install it, I just haven't had the time to look into it. But I believe it does have working multiplayer.
no problem :P
The more I learn Python, the more impressed I get. The other day I wrote a simple program. I made a function that collected a list of numbers, then a function to print that list out along with the average. Simple, I was proud I was able.to do it from my head and not searching all over for how to do it. Then I looked up how to actually do it. sum(list_name) / len(list_name) Oh....well that's just way mo betta lol.
Is it still current, being a first print from 2015?
In Python, if two modules try to import each other, they'll get into an infinite loop and crash. This is a common problem for new programmers, but it's actually an anti-pattern that should be avoided even in languages that allow it. &amp;#x200B; More Info: [https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/11856/whats-wrong-with-circular-references](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/11856/whats-wrong-with-circular-references)
&gt; Have you installed the pypyodbc module? You won't have to install the module if you provide the full path to it, or change the working directory to the containing folder.
1. /r/learnpython 2. You don't need to do anything differently through a .bat than you would directly on the command line. Keep in mind pathing though, sounds like you have a mismatch between where the .bat is being run from and where the Python script and Python module are.
And why's that?
beautiful
Thank you for that, I was thinking it might have to do with something along those lines. I wonder if I have multiple instance of Python on my machine, one where I installed the module and one where I didn’t.
Yes, I’ve installed the module. It runs with no problem when run directly through Idle
If you're interested in using Django instead, Wagtail is awesome ( [https://wagtail.io/](https://wagtail.io/) ). I recently moved my personal site from Wordpress to Wagtail, it was super simple to get setup.
Sure. I'd recommend doing the `C:\absolute\path\to\python.exe -m pip install pypyodbc` from /u/spyingwind's comment and then trying again. If the .bat still doesn't work after that, then use absolute paths in your .bat file for both the python interpreter you want to use as well as the python script you want to run.
For a developer for anything I’d argue.
That is nowhere near enough. You really should just use systemd (perhaps in user mode, perhaps with a runtime-generated service), or if you really want to avoid that, use one of the tools that claims to implement subsets of its functionality (but don't blame me for any bugs).
Thank you. I already have created classes that I want to serialize/deserialize into, so that box doesn't seem too useful for my purpose. I'm looking for a python equivalent to Java's jackson library which enables deserialization with annotations.
I don't believe it's that simple because the bars smoothly transition and move from one position to another. This couldn't be accomplished with just merging images.
Yes and certain languages make certain types of errors easier or harder to make. We're not all perfect programmers.
&gt; In a manually memory managed language (like C, or most C++ codebases) memory leaks are a very common developer error that pops up all the time Sounds like you haven't programmed C++ in a very long time. Memory leaks really aren't an issue if you use smart pointers, and even crappy code bases use smart pointers exclusively these days.
In terms of what order to learn fundamental concepts, learnXinYminutes presents ideas in a pretty sensible sequence. [https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python3/](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python3/)
It's actually not that close if you look at the professional landscape. Python is on Stack Overflow more often because it's being rapidly picked up as the starter language for colleges and the premier programming language for data science and the hard sciences. That means there's a lot of non-programmers transitioning to programming. Java, C languages, and JavaScript are still the most widely used to develop business applications by a mile. Python is growing on all fronts and may catch up, but it will need to develop a bit quicker and find out how to match up with JavaScript in execution speed.
indeed, it's been a while and I make no claims at being a C++ expert. smart pointers are a GREAT example of solving the problem with a language feature though.
Wow, django is second but I don’t see flask? Interesting.
are you running it under a different context like using task scheduler when you use the .bat file?
Also, stop agreeing to work at places who still do.
I get why that annoyed you, but I appreciated the artistic aesthetic of having a relative X. The way things bloomed and shrank next to their neighbors looks better this way.

Give py4e.com/book a look and download the PDF. I've been taking a College course on Python since January and it isn't nearly as helpful as when I'm just trying to figure out how to do something I want. It's in part due to the structure and nature of the specific course, but I don't learn much when I just have to copy the professor's code a few times as he shows examples and then tells us to now come yo with a solution for something absolutely different.

That's what Delphi users keep telling me as they claim Pascal is "going strong". Stack Overflow has already considered what you're talking about. While Java questions fluctuate with the school year, Python's don't, indicating it's much more than just school students.

I agree. This post means almost nothing in my opinion. They probably just crawled a bunch of job posts and parsed out all the words. The hell is the "skill" called "API"? That's like saying "what skills do we want devs to have? Internet." It means nothing. It represents nothing because it's too vague a term.
Exactly what I though, like listing agile as a skill. Sure you can have experience on an agile team but end of the day it’s just a management style...
An Electrical Engineering design project involving an Internet-of-Things two-factor-authentication door. The door is 3D printed and locked by a solenoid latch. A Raspberry Pi 3B+ controls it via a relay (since the RPi cannot drive enough current to trip the switch) and a custom-designed level shifter (since the relay is activated by 5V, but the RPi pins are 3.3V). A 12V power supply directly supplies the latch and the relay; the RPi draws power from it through a UBEC (a 12V-to-5V step-down transformer... a product of the remote-controlled vehicle community!) The RPi has a webcam, a WiFi micro-dongle (in addition to its onboard WiFi adapter), and an RGB LED for status signaling. Here’s the 2FA part: A user connects to an access point created by the RPi, visits a locally served website, clicks an Unlock button on the page, and looks into a camera. The RPi has a database of registered faces and MAC addresses of associated devices. Based on evaluation of the current image and the MAC address of the requesting device, the RPi either admits the user (unlocking the door) or denies entry. Both outcomes are signaled by the LED, as well as sending an SMS message alert to a registered phone number via Twilio. (Incidentally, that’s why it needs two WiFi adapters: to maintain an access point while also sending status notifications.) The project involves six sets of Python scripts: (1) A daemon that manages all of the components. It opens a named pipe in the file system and receives commands. (2) A simple administrative script to feed commands into the named pipe for a user who is SSHed into the RPi. (3) cgi-bin scripts hosted by the RPi local webserver to translate web page events into commands to the daemon. (4) A service hosted by a public website that creates a couple of communication channels for IoT-based communication. The trick is that I wanted it to be lightweight, connectionless, and daemonless (the server for the public website is *really* commodity... I had to pay extra for the privilege of SSHing into it...!), so it’s a CGI script that maintains some text files. (5) A monitor that polls the public website for incoming commands, translates them to input to the named pipe, and posts updates to the public website in JSON and XML. (6) A remote command script that demonstrates how a service could remotely interact with the RPi / door through the public website. It’s been quite a ride. And the project had flown together in the course of a month - probably 90% of the effort going to the electronics and 3D design and printing. The software and OS components had to wait for last, and... they’re adequate and not terrible, but not exactly polished. Nothing is encrypted, although the infrastructure is protected by hashing everything with a shared key (via SHA-1... yes, I know it’s broken, but it’s just a demo :) ) Lots of educational value, even if all of the technology and code are completely straightforward. Looking forward to applying the knowledge (and confidence!) to bigger projects to come.
Can you expand a bit more on the last sentence about GUI frameworks ? if possible list them ? would be really helpful if you could point me to right direction.
If you find it fun, just do it. I think you might have fun learning to draw all sorts of weird shit in matplotlib. Like for a start, a chessboard, then random labyrinth patterns or something like that. Try drawing a [Ulam spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral). Then go on to animations. I had fun implementing an animated Game of Life, and planar mathematical billards on all sorts of shapes. In the process I learned a lot, eg. that matplotlib isn't as good for animations as pyqtgraph.
&gt; Also, Stack Overflow questions track very well with Github project contribution rates. Does that include the billions of lines of code in private GitHubs? Almost none of the tens of thousands of repositories at my employer's private GitHub are Python. All of these stats really fail to capture the vast swaths of code and multitude of programmers that aren't putting things on public GitHubs and aren't bothering with SO or the like because there's thousands of other programmers at said employer that can easily field any possible questions internally. Don't get me wrong, I love Python and use it a lot for my own projects, but thinking it's the most popular language when there's vast amounts of untracked data is sort of like saying Hydrogen is the most common form of matter in the universe while failing to account for dark matter entirely.
For an async framework check out [Bocadillo](https://github.com/bocadilloproject/bocadillo).
And don't fuck indentation, try fucking something else - it might be more fun.
There should be one and preferably only one way to do it. Yes, there are solutions to problems, you shouldn’t be using unsafe anything assuming you’re not programming for embedded systems and even then you should think hard about it.
Doing `select * from whatever ...` is pretty bad practice. Spell out which columns you actually want. Also, use parametrized queries -- but others said so already.
Familiarity with any VCS. I don't care if it's git. I also hire plenty of people that will never interact with a database so I don't care if they know sql
I expect them to know how to manage thier own dependencies, package creation and distribution.
I've seen some of his videos and I agree that he is a very good speaker. I just don't know if the course is good value.
Your right , I’ll fuck something else
&gt;while action!='add'and'view'and'exit': &amp;#x200B; That condition will not work as you expect, you probably want to use "action not in ('add', 'view', 'exit')" instead. Are you sure a single "while" loop for all of the actions would'nt work better?
I must say, I was pleasantly surprised.
I make a point of telling this to interns that I interview. Too many colleges still don't teach/explain the importance of version control and it's a travesty.
&gt; Does that include the billions of lines of code in private GitHubs? Almost &gt;none of the tens of thousands of repositories at my employer's private &gt;GitHub are Python. I see this claim too. Unless there's some reason to believe that there exists a large cache of secret users of a language, it's special pleading to assume the distribution of private repository code is significantly different. Again, github stats, stack overflow stats, scans of job listings on employment sites, etc. all produce roughly the same language rankings, reinforcing the idea of predictive value. &gt;because there's thousands of other programmers at said employer that &gt;can easily field any possible questions internally. I've worked at the HQ of a billion-dollar company. No one decides to trek to someone else's cubicle to ask a question before looking it up on Stack Overflow.
Okay, tomorrow I can start with trying it out, the measured data is complete. Curious how the plot will look like ....
Ours did... and they’ve given us a project in which we have to collaborate using it... but they’ve done IMO a terrible job of it. Most other team members commit messages lack any description, they push into master recklessly and frankly the project demands skills (or experience) which they haven’t given us so some of the members are pushing badly written code. VC is only difficult because, like in most other computing related courses, it’s taught as part of an academic subject. Computing isn’t academic, institutions keep throwing text facts at budgeoning programmers and think that gives them the skills to program... it doesn’t. Good on my uni for demanding a practical task, but the prerequisites for it haven’t been met so it’s still a flawed learning approach.
Sorry did not read carefully, to be more professional I think the following might help: - write lots of code - read good books about writing software - actively work to use what you learned - 4-6 months after you write something go in and do a code review/rewrite As you exercise your software muscles you will get better and more experienced at managing complexity in big and small things, the big things are much more important and profitable
I faced a similar issue, in my scenario it was caused by the environment variables being different between the user that tested the script and the user that ran the script in production. Since I couldn't change the user, I added a few lines to my .bat file: (assuming the .bat file sits in the same folder as the python script) `:: Store the path where the .bat file is located` `SET parent=%~DP0` `:: Add Python to PATH - UPDATE WITH THE PYTHON LOCATION FOR YOUR SYSTEM` `SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files (x86)\Python37-32` `:: And then you call the python script like this` `python %parent%python-script.py`
Wish i didn't have a mac..... and you ppl do too....
We have very different ideas of critical apparently! I've been doing pretty heavy python the last 4 years and not touched a single line of SQL in that time. Not everything hits a database
Does "Linux" mean they know how to navigate the Linux file system? Thorough knowledge of the Linux kernel codebase? Contributed to an open source Linux project?

Took a quick look at this and first impression is that I like it a lot. Will use in future projects.
You can check for multiple pythons using "py" at the command prompt: py -0 That's "p y space minus zero". "py -h" and "py -V" work. A .bat should look like: @echo on cd /d c:\Users\you\... py prog.py &lt;arguments&gt; @pause If you have multiple pythons, use "py -2" or "py -3" or "py -3.6". You can use e.g. "py -3.7 -m pip install" to control which python environment you modify.
This is the coolest thing I've seen in a minute.
Entire string module is extremely useful, it contains anything you will ever need for validating user input or anything like that
On Python 3.4 or above `from statistics import mean` Done.
Those mature platforms you mention might be written in other languages but wrapped and accessed from Python with a Pythonic interface. &amp;#x200B; Please further explain your second sentence: &gt; It's pretty rare that you encounter a problem that has only been solved in Python.
Thanks for mentioning Bocadillo! (Which, as a disclaimer, I am the maintainer of.) We’re indeed working towards an easy-peasy GraphQL integration! I’m personally pretty excited about this. To be fair though, I can’t say Bocadillo is or will be a dominant framework for 2019. But OP may want to check it out to get a glimpse of all the exciting stuff that is happening in the async web framework space right now. :-) Asyncio for the web *is* definitely taking off!
SSH?
Too vague.
Luckily for me, my knowledge of API and Agile is off da hook...
