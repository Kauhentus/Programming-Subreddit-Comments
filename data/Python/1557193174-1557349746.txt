While you are accurate that the Python interpreter converts the code to CPython byte code, you can also write code in directly in CPython as well.
The code snippets are, but it teaches design patterns in a pretty generic way. I know he asked for python books, but to my knowledge, I don't know of any good design pattern books that use python for it's examples. Basically, the book is really good if you need an introduction into design patterns. You will walk away understanding the concepts of several patterns (factory, singleton, etc.) and if you already understand OOP, you should be able to apply it to the language of your choice.

We need HTTP for dogs.
Parsing through an excel sheet with contract information, organizing it, and printing it to a plain text .txt file; formatted in such a way that the information can easily be copied and pasted into Outlook plaintext emails without messing up the formatting. It sounds weird, and it is, but it took me a ton of time before and became my first, "Wait, I'm learning Python, I can code this.." It took about 4 hours of manual work before I scripted it. No one at my company could get certain tasks done until I finally got around to it. Now there's an .exe in a Dropbox file that anyone can click on and 5 seconds later everything you can possibly need is organized and formatted. It's simple. It's basic. It's a bit pathetic. But it's mine. It's the first practical, functional, and reliable script I've ever written. Even better is that writing it took less than half of the time that the manual parsing took me, so even the scripting itself turned out to be an efficient use of my time. I fucking love this shit, man.
You're looking for `from flask import Flask`. Also in the future, a more appropriate place for questions like these is /r/askpython.
Sorry about that, I'll be sure to divert posts there instead. Just a follow up, from flask import Flask is already part of my code
Are you in a virtual environment? My guess is that you installed flask on your main Python installation. You should install it in the virtual environment instead.
Yes in a virtual environment, and have made sure flask is installed in the virtual environment
What module/library do you recommend for building python gui’s
I see what the issue is as u/bbenne10 pointed out. You need to import a "title-cased" Flask. `from flask import Flask` instead of `from flask import flask`
Ahhh that clarifies things, thank you (both). Didnt even notice the upper case in that
&gt;you can also write code directly in CPython as well. What do you mean by this? Cython won't be much faster if OP really wants the data structure they say they want. Pypy won't let OP write C code, but is probably the best option because OP can use Python data structures.
TLDR: sorted() works on a copy of the original list, sort() orders the list in place.
Almost everybody?
Should I ask? I have no idea what's up.
In this context though it’s pretty easy to find fault. He’s complaining specifically about lists of quotes.
A hastily written blog post is always a mistake, but the author must bear the responsibility for words fired off in anger.
You don’t get to call strikes, you’re not an umpire.
I know this is the python sub and there's some fun animosity between the two languages, but I'm asking about specific examples. Not because I don't believe the guy, but because I want to ready some juicy drama.
Just something internal. I'd like to make it open source but that's hard to do
Pythception
Well it's not US exclusive as I got it with my ac.za email as well
Requests is probably to general to be TMd. Like how Microsoft couldn't TM Windows, but had to go with "Microsoft (tm) Windows (tm)"
Your best bet is so rely on one of the ORMs you have available, usually Django ORM or SQLAlchemy. You can use Python’s std lib csv library (or PANDAS) to import the data: the goal being that your data is represented ultimately in your data model as Python objects.
Do you think there are more pythons or python developers in the wild?
What other community would want PyCharm?
Some people collect stamps, some collect flowers in a scrap book, some collect pens. I wouldnt judge someone for being into pens, it's just a piece of art. You're not using it on a daily basis.
I'm not talking about Kenneth.
Your assertion was a general statement. It doesn't apply in general and it's not clear if it applies here.
That's awesome! Well done. I remember the first time I put together a couple scripts that condensed a few hours of intense manual work into a fully automated job that ran in jew a few minutes. A whole new world!

Maybe you should think about it a bit more well that's what I thought about what you think at least.
Hardware interface code for some ThorLabs devices using their APT framework. I've written stuff for serial communication interfaces before, and that was ok, but this is real USB, and it's a different ball of wax. Communicating with the FTDI chip is easy enough, but the header / data format is kinda of wacky, and the manual isn't the greatest. So it's a lot of "There are only so many combinations of bitwise logic operators and possible addresses here".
What an asshole.
No, you're going to want some sort of desktop environment. Unless you want to use curses, though that's a whole different library with different goals. For future reference, you'll want to ask this on /r/learnpython
Sorry I’ll do that next time
Andrey knows how to lead. Great project.
Awesome, useful
No, this is not how it works. Code written by other authors belongs to those authors unless they explicitly sign over copyright or grant a license to use their code. This is the same reason the Linux Foundation or Linus Torvalds cannot decide to change Linux's license from GPL 2 to say GPL 3 or MIT. The Linux Foundation/Torvalds would need to get permission from everyone who has ever contributed to Linux in order to change the license. This is also the same reason that Google open source projects [have contributors agree to their CLA](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual): you explicitly grant an irrevocable license to Google to do pretty much whatever they want with your contributions. Here's the relevant text: &gt; You hereby grant to Google and to recipients of software distributed by Google a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

&gt; That's great and all, but if he hasn't written any of the new code (the mentioned blog post said that he hasn't contributed since 2017?), then does he still have copyright over it? No, unless each contributor to `requests` explicitly transferred their copyright or granted Kenneth Reitz a license to relicense their contributions, Kenneth does not own the copyright to another developer's contribution to `requests`.
Thanks for the clarification. To renew another year is going to run about $57 which is worth it to me. I saw VS code mentioned and I've heard excellent things about it. I'll try it out at some point.
I usually use wxPython but Qt for Python is good too
How many devices can I install it on with one subscription license?
If the while loop is already in the else statement then that section wont be used unless the previous if statements were false. Thats the best i can tell without indentation.
I have that book. Maybe I’ll dive back into it. Thanks! I didn’t because it was Java based, but you make some valid points. My Java is just rusty.
His journal entry is full of even more shit which I cut up. https://www.reddit.com/r/python/comments/bku40b/_/emjm6et
For gitlab city (and other docker containers), I recommend installing without the virtual environment: $ poetry config settings.virtualenvs.create=False Goes easily into a dockerfile or the before_script section of .gitlab-ci.yml
No, he responded in a journal post, which was equivalently shit: https://www.reddit.com/r/python/comments/bku40b/_/
Also read https://www.reddit.com/r/python/comments/bku40b/_/ And my biased personal favorite response from myself: https://www.reddit.com/r/python/comments/bku40b/_/emjm6et
Lets hope he gets an editor to remove the third-person egomania.
I'm in no way his fan, as indicative by the constant times I've cut up his bullshit. But his love/sex life is none of anyone's business except his and his partners.
That response was posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/python/comments/bku40b/_/), which I [personally enjoyed cutting up](https://www.reddit.com/r/python/comments/bku40b/_/emjm6et).
Lmao what
Got ‘em
Sadly such an understatement. His ego pumps through his veins at 210% under normal circumstances.
Infinite loop because of indentation. r/learnpython
No time to explain START UPLOADIN....
Yeeeessssss......ssss....
Hahahahahahahaha Noice And no, I just use vim, real tools for big boyz like me, MrKulGuy
Why's it holding an arduino? Arduinos don't use python.
You missed a real good opportunity to put pi in that python...
Aside: if you like home automation, check out [home assistant.](https://home-assistant.io) . It’s an open source home automation platform written in python. It basically ties everything together. There are 1,300+ integrations.

I don't have specific examples but every interaction that I had with Ruby/Rails community was pretty bad. I avoid the language and even more the framework at all costs.
tl;dr - I've encountered a lot of programmers that were bored shitless, but they were in boring, repetitive jobs. Everyone I personally work with are very engaged and enthusiastic because we are working on hard and interesting problems. . I'm early fifties, and have been programming professionally since I was 21. I've never really found it boring, but I also made efforts to stay current or cutting edge. Because there are *tons* of boring jobs. Things like -program this form to take in input, validate it, send it to a database, perform an SQL query and display the results. The kind of stuff you may do endless for, say, and insurance adjuster or something. Tedious, boring shit. Don't do that. Get a good education (not a bootcamp) and you can do things like compute cancer statistics on big multiprocessor systems, program a flight computer for a helicopter (my second job), work on computer vision and robots, along with avionics (third job), and now I'm heavy into the mathematical side of computer vision. Every day is a challenge - i have no idea how to achieve what I need to achieve, but that is because no one knows; I'm inventing it. I know this probably comes off as brag-y, but you know, someone has to do this interesting work, but there are more jobs that are boring, and everyone wants to do the cool stuff. It's competitive, so you have to prepare. Once you 'get in' it becomes a lot easier to move laterally or up because you've established your abilities. If you are worried about being bored, that's a pretty good sign that you'll become bored if not challenged. So to you I say aim high. Learn machine learning, learn Bayesian methods, learn linear algebra, maybe computer vision, probably some low level embedded work, and how to build basic circuitry - stuff that'll get you doing really cool and challenging stuff. Well, maybe that exact stuff isn't too your particular interests, but find something to help you stand out amongst the sea of people that know javascript, SQL, and react or whatever. Or, you know, learn some web UI stuff at a bootcamp and write 100 iterations of nearly the same app until you are sticking pencils in your eyeballs for a change of pace. I know this is a bit opinionated and elitist, but if you are concerned about boredom and are pursuing your own projects you probably have the capacity to become very, very bored. And I've ran into a lot of programmers with 10-20 years of experience asking how to get the 'cool' work, because they are driven crazy with their jobs. Kinda too late, for the most part, it's hard to start over when you have a family, kids, responsibilities. There's certainly a lot of luck and being in the right place at the right time in having a good career, but you'll never even get the chance at innovative work if you don't have the background/education for it.

This is great! And even encouraged. Just one side-note for beginners: &gt; urllib3 eclipsed 50 million monthly installs across all #Python versions for the first time! The bulk of PyPi installs are not real humans typing `pip install urllib3`. They're mostly build systems (travis.ci) pulling libraries with every new build. Very popular packages like `requests` or even `pip` itself rely on `urllib3`, so it adds up.
Hmmm? Subjective. Comparing apples to oranges.

Hi samameul sorry I was away for a vacation for the past week and didn't reply. But I have a good news. After optimizing my code I'm able to reach 60fps on windows using both the DirectXDesktopDuplication method and the BitBlt method. I used a C++ library: [smasherprog](https://github.com/smasherprog)/[**screen\_capture\_lite**](https://github.com/smasherprog/screen_capture_lite)**.** I combined this library with OpenCV to make my own library: [YLiLarry](https://github.com/YLiLarry)/[**ggframe**](https://github.com/YLiLarry/ggframe)**.** To see an example, you can compile this on windows/mac and run the ggcapture\_example executable with Task Manager (on windows) or Activity Monitor (on mac) open.
Actually if you shitpost like... between noon and 10pm EST that's the best bet.

Gotcha, sorry you had rough experiences mate, people can get too elitist and rude
Uh, no. No. Very no.
This article is totally obsolet! It's only a collection of dumb and general phrases without deep diving into the language specific strengthes and weaknesses. Really poorly written! I wonder why people invest time into writing this kind of crap? They would have better invested their time into studdying and practising one of those languages 😉
at least for the pencil tho : EDC = every day carry. But i agree with you and see it more as a collector fetish or sth like that. still a holy shit moment for me because my whole laptop is that price
this is kind of hard question to ask since recently python can do basically anything...it has bind to almost anything you can think of, and while your question is talking about professional python users, same applies...i think only limitation u can think of is stuff that is very heavy in computation (even tho we have numpy heh) since it is scripting language. Recently i realised that very very small scripts are often better withou using python...for example if you have keybind to show volume its better to have it in compiled language because it takes some extra miliseconds to run python and it aint that smooth, but except that python is used almost everywhere and we all benefit from that huge community

Mobile users. Old doesn't redirect to the mobile website, but new does.
Microsoft can literally fall down the stairs for all I care. I’ve been using Linux for a year now and never looking back.
Yay windows for the win ! Here comes FOSS extremists haha
This is how anyone who tries Linux feels.
Personally I find the mobile version lacking in features (for no apparant reason) and buggy. While I may misclick every now and then, but at least I get to open user profiles, find the same submission in other subreddits and open stuff in a new tab.
You get updates. The last update you get on a subscription is yours forever. But yeah, it was better when you could buy once.
I switched to MacOS about a year ago and this is the first time since I’ve been excited about a Windows feature. I don’t use Windows much but I can’t wait to try this
Thank you! I knew this one, forget about it after 10 years of frontend work.
No.
This actually depends on a lot of factors like work environment, colleagues etc. The only thing that keeps me motivated is my work life balance. If you are maintaining a proper work life balance then whatever work you are doing becomes fun and exciting even if you are doing it from a long time. Yes, I also engage myself into learning other technologies as well apart from my usual work which gives a great enthusiasm and create more opportunities. Though I also do not get much time with the usual work but with so many Online Learning programs available, it becomes easy to pick time for that.
You know, like this realy awsome virtual desktops Win10 introduced? All we GNU/Linux users were so jealous about this brand new feature
lmao this is great xD
Weeeeell not really. I use Ubuntu every day and have for years, but I still wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is not a developer over Windows.
r/lostredditors
I've used Linux for 20 years. Microsoft's moves recently have made me interested in giving windows a shot again. This, the new WSL stuff and pg_auto_failover are all good things.
Suck cock retard
I love linux BUT: Linux is not for desktops, period. I'm so frustrated when some GUI error come in, and I've to dig forums for half solutions, of course this thing comes in when I'm working on something important. Windows is going to be a good alternative, I'd like to see proper support for remote development support for Visual studio code. Mac is also a good alternative for desktops but that price tag...

Have you ever considered this may be a you issue rather than a Linux issue . If you pick the right distro, you will almost never have an issue.
Is this sarcasm? Popular desktop environments have had virtual desktops far, far longer than Win10.
How is this embrace, extend, extinguish? Keep in mind that Linux is GPL-licensed and, hence, Microsoft has to publish all modifications they make to it under the same license.
you've been using linux for a year. i've been using linux (and windows, and macos) for uuuuh at least 15 years. &amp;#x200B; linux is not ready for desktops in professional environments. probably will never be, unless the FOSS contributors stop fighting over engineering stuff and start recruiting and working with ui-ux designers and so on. the hours of troubleshooting for even simple things sum up to days wasted every year fighting regressions, non-working tools, compiling stuff which is not packaged for your distro (try to have python 3.7 on latest ubuntu lts, its trivial on every other os, it's not on ubuntu and i have to help people with it), ecc. &amp;#x200B; this does not mean that you can't use linux and be happy with it. it just means that, for professionals, the computer is a tool to do a job. the overhead on linux maintenance is too high. do carpenters have to waste days every year just to service their hammer?
&gt; I'd like to see proper support for remote development support for Visual studio code Like this? https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/remote-python-development-in-visual-studio-code/
Why? To be honest, what's new about all that features to a Linux user? (Genuinely asking)
I think I came a little when it substituted the &lt;= with one symbol.
It's just a font with special ligatures (look up Fira Code, for example). It's good for IDE but can get in the way and be annoying in terminals.
You can already do that with a lot of Terms. The one I use (iTerm2) has supported ligatures in fonts for a while.
A whole year, wow. You little rebel you...
For a whole year? Is it Arch? /s Dude... c'mon. You cant climb that high on the horse in just a year.
Fair question. In my opinion It honestly depends on your needs. If you can do everything you want in a Linux distro of your preference, then you're good. If your needs require leveraging of the Windows ecosystem then changes like these make it easier to stick with Windows by mitigating some of the advantages offered by Linux.
Looks promising!
Should this have been posted somewhere else?

Thanks! Yes, you are right, I will extend on that

You are not paid to have fun at work. You are paid to do the boring stuff other people cannot do because they lack the patience and self-discipline you are expected to have.
Ben using Linux as my only desktops for nearly 20 years. Haven't had an issue like you're describing in about 10.
Just trying to understand, what future do you see? From the video, it looked like a wrapper to wrap cmd and PS in one window. What else? &amp;#x200B; And why there is an ad for a **free** terminal application? &amp;#x200B; Does r/ohmyzsh work?
The uncompromising is about that we don't want to configure it. It should just have 1 setting. &amp;#x200B; Now, uncompromising doesn't mean it should just choose its own standard without merit. It would be the best to make it a democratic decision and then stick to it. &amp;#x200B; I proposed that change while it was beta status, and even though the author himself said that "90ish should be preferred", he actually chose 88. Setting a new weird standard for no good reason.

Lots of python users use Windows exclusively, especially in the anaconda and machine learning worlds. They will be happy to have this available in Windows
`# apt install python3`
\+1, but 12 years ago. Still, MacOS has everything linux-compatible, and Windows terminal still has Windows Shell.
Almost all Python users also use keyboards and mice. Those aren't topical for this subreddit either.
Holy smoke, I knew it was being developed but already in Insider's Build? On top of it it supports wsl . I have something to play with today
Yes, it was meant in an sarcastic manner. Because most Windows Folks was like „Look what we got linux loosers“ And as you pointed out, we had this feature for a very long time.
You can’t put lipstick on a pig. It’s still not a Unix shell
Use linux
CMD + Powershell + WSL combined in one application with a nice design
Better moderation+content takes at least a little bit of effort
Energy consumption depends mainly on the CPU. The memory usage for exmaple is a more common characteristic for benchmarks.
It look nice. I understand that I need to install all of those system features first? I for few years cmder on windows and it has option to use bash without a need to install Linux kernels on my W10.
Nothing about the fact that he had a poly relationship hints at him being shitty to anyone in his private life.
That's a circular argument. Either you know his personality and make an assumption about the nature of his relationship based on that. Or you know the nature of his relationship and make assumptions about his personality based on that. You can't so both.
Not really. Of course there are narcissists trying to exploit poly people, but poly people come from all walks of life and with all personalities.
God this sub is turning to shit
The second one is true, but being poly and being gay is quite comparable. E.g. I'm at least “bi” in my relationship preferences, as I can find happiness in both a monogamous relationship and an open one (can't personally say anything about poly, but you get what I mean)
Congrats Microsoft, you've officially caught up with technology of 2 decades ago.
You're making broad, sweeping statements about a part of society that is definitely not defined by any kind of personality traits, except maybe by an above average ability to communicate and self reflect (caused by having to deal with the feelings and expectations of multiple partners)

Excellent argument.
Programming have been my first hobby since I am 14 and I coded nearly each single day since, after classes, during hollydays, during week-ends... Now I am in internship and I coded all work day and often I cannot type a line of code when I go back home. Everything can become boring when you do it 8 hours/day. Also I still like the work I do (I am an intern so I did not do that for 10 years) but I no longer start ambitious projects at home for pleasure. Another problem with professional programming is that you loose interest for your project. A multi language project help though.
If you're concerned about that, turn your computer off permanently.
That's not the point. I aim to suggest a better way to program with consideration of energy consumption. It's important when it's a large software that runs a many devices.

It is completely unrelated but I would like to point out that there is nothing wrong to use 3rd person instead of 1st one.

I remember getting a one year license by simply stating that I contribute to open source python and giving my github project link. I didn't care to renew after that, not sure whether they still grant license to FOSS projects. I simply use notepad++ now.

Zeep works well if you need to connect to someone else's SOAP server. For writing a SOAP server or generating WDSL files I'm looking for good solutions myself. I have not found anything good and usally end up writing the server from scratch when I need to be SOAP compatable. One thing that comes up is soapfish, but I have not tried this yet.
Start benchmarking full applications rather than small snippets of code. We know that Python will probably be less efficient in energy use for the same reason it is slower: the executable code is running at a higher abstraction level and does more per instruction. So to be fair, you probably want to compare equivalent applications written in similarly high-level languages, like Javascript/Ruby/Python/Perl rather than Python versus C for example.
I showed where i changed a lib using `os.system` to `subprocess`. And then I mentioned I can use this instead of the horrible mess that is `npm`to minify my js and then I just preempted why I would rather use closure this way. Which turns my comment into something senseless... thanks for the reply.
This is what I used as well, oh so many years ago! [Zeep](https://python-zeep.readthedocs.io/en/master/) looks like a newer client that seems interesting.

You're right. I was working on little programs because I thought that it could help in the detection of really heavy part in a software. I've written multithread and multiprocess programs and I try different implementation of algorithms. I'll try to find python project on github and study it. Thanks
Thanks. :)
We're the only ones.....
Pip dependency resolution is very lacking, but that's the correct behavior. It's a package *requirement* if pkgb needs pkga &gt;= 2 that means your lock file (requirements.txt) is wrong. BTW I personally use pip-compile and pip-sync from pip-tools package to generate and use a lock file. There is also an option for pip to ignore dependencies (don't remember from top of my head).
I think they use https://github.com/leereilly/swot
That's what pip freeze does, so I don't know how you would get into that scenario unless you manually edited requirements.

Return is specifying what the function plusOne(number) will return when it is done running. newNumber = plusOne(5) is setting newNumber equal to whatever value plusOne(5) returns.

I'm working on [Trackarma](https://github.com/paramt/trackarma), a python script that tracks reddit karma. [I've set up an example](https://trackarma tk) that's been tracking u/GallowBoob's karma every minute and graphing it
Ok. So when you run a function Python runs the code inside the function until it reaches a break or a return. Ok, so plusOne(5) gives 6 right? (As in it returns 6) so plusOne(5) is basically a variable that has 6 in it. so newNumber is set to what plusOne(5) is equal to (6). so newNumber is basically a variable holding 6 after that. Hope this helps.

So let's break down this line: `newNumber = plusOne(5)` We're assigning the value returned by the plusOne() function, but before that value can be assigned, that function must be called and executed. So this line executes the plusOne() function first, with the parameter of 5, adds 1 to 5 and returns the value of 6. So our line of code can be broken down to: `newNumber = plusOne(5)` `newNumber = (5 + 1)` `newNumber = 6` I hope this helps!
So I don't have any experience with PyCharm (which I'm guessing is the IDE that you're using, correct me if I'm wrong) but I do know that when you install python packages (at least with python-pip) the packages are added to the "bin" folder of wherever your system stores your version of python. So it wouldn't show up in the folders shown in your imgur link, but you should still be able to use it in your programs without issue. Hope that helps!
If you just want a Python interpreter, [Repl.it](repl.it) is a good one.
The energy consumption signature of various structures are insignificant noise on top of the overall consumption of keeping the computer turned on in the first place.
Thanks for explaining! So let me better understand this. For example. plusOne(7) gives 8 since it returns 8. so newNumber = 8 since plusOne(7) is the variable that contains 8. Please correct me if I am wrong.
[PySimpleGUI](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org) can embed Matplotlib/PyPlot into GUIs. I just submitted this GUI yesterday as an entry to a [Repl.it](https://Repl.it) Code Jam. It shows 3 Matplotlib graphs on a couple of tabs and then a couple of tabs that a traditional GUI controls. You can of course combine the plots and controls on one screen if you want. The example window is a bit cramped due to limits of [repl.it](https://repl.it) window size.

This is correct. return can return any object not just integers so remember when returning something that it's actually the object you want to return.
Python 3 is also available from the Microsoft Store: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/python-37/9nj46sx7x90p (You didn't mention what OS you use, but other commenters already covered Linux, and I think Mac OS X comes with Python preinstalled? I don't use Mac OS.)
What do you miss out on with the free version?
Algorithms and data structures are abstractions. You don't need to learn them "in JS" or "in Python" or whatever, if you understand the concepts, you can implement them in any language. If your way of learning is memorizing the code, don't do that.
It is if you include vat.
You should learn algorithms and data structures as theoretical concepts; you don't necessarily need a programming language to learn about them. Once you have learned them, the translation from the idea (the algorithm/DS) to code is the easy, mechanical step.
Thank you for reply. It was indeed the weights.sum(). I made the grid of stock prices and not the log\_stock, which ended up being to spread out it seems so that the values passed to the kernel in a few cases all ended up out of bounds of (-1;1) and thus giving zero in the sum.
If you aren't already using it, you should try iTerm2. I didn't see anything in that video that iTerm2 hasn't had for years.

You don't understand algorithms and data structures "in a language" - that's the whole point, they are abstract things, independent of the language you implement them in. Bubble sort is bubble sort, whether you implement it in C, Python, INTERCAL, Brainfuck, or Haskell. It's the same algorithm; if you can only grasp it in a specific language, then you don't understand the algorithm, just the implementation.

I'm trying to find a process to automate a connection between Spyder on my desktop and a remote server's Python 3. The best thing I can find involves remote console commands via SCP, copying a file to the local machine and then manually setting a bunch of connection properties and pointing to the downloaded file (Spyder's 'way of doing it'). I've just about got everyone on board to try some serious data analysis at work, but if I start my 'how to' presentation with "just follow this 73 step process every time you want to do something", it's over before it starts.
Nice commercial. I'll stick to Linux, thanks.

Fundamentally, I owuld guess that your issue comes from the fact that your python script does not have the same permissions as your browser. Without further info, there is no way to understand how you are doing auth, to guess at what your authorization issue could be.

[Repl.it](https://Repl.it) is a great environment for running Python in a web browser. They have a tkinter version. I use it for [PySimpleGUI](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org) and PySimpleGUIWeb I post versions of code there written in PySimpleGUI and PySimpleGUIWeb. They both run nearly as quickly as they do on my PC. I just don't get very much screen real estate. Here's [a little program I submitted to a code jam](https://repl.it/@PySimpleGUI/Lottery) last night using repl.it. The idea was to display lottery data in a variety of ways. It's running PySimpleGUI which is based on tkinter. If you want to program directly in tkinter, you can do that of course too.

I only touched GUIs briefly but my impression is that it solely depends on what you want to do, and beyond that what you find more comfortable using. For example: pygame is a GUI you can use for games - tkinter is also a GUI but you can't use it for advanced game UI design (as far as I know). But tkinter is easier for a quick and easy UI of an app, like a regular app with buttons and stuff, not a game.
You are indeed correct.
There have been many abortive attempts at SOAP clients in the past, but Zeep seems to be the only one actively being maintained, and is generally well regarded. It is also performs well due to its caching of WSDL, which is especially important for large WSDLs.

No, it wouldn’t - what is released is released, terms cannot be changed retroactively. Any change would affect new versions only.

I'm certainly not an expert in threading in python, but I don't see anything to indicate when a thread finishes. Are you certain, it isn't just pumping these all out into separate running threads until it runs out of memory? You probably need to join your thread back to the main thread, and then exit the process.
Great idea. Wish this were around a couple of years ago.
Because not every problem is solved by dumping JSON.
You didn't say anything about how this GUI should behave or where it should run. But in even so I will point you in the direction of [Kivy](https://kivy.org/) which is a cool project for many types of GUI. Tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfwnDTZWw8H3hN_VRQfq8rF).
I was not aware of VADER. Thank you for the introduction.
Because JSON cant represent everything. Its at best a data format for serialization of transferrable data, thats usually language agnostic. JSON cant represent functions, and more abstract datatypes.
Let's break this down: &amp;#x200B; 1) The error you got, `"name 'url_data' is not defined"` means that when you tried to use `'url_data'`, it did not exist. 2) So when you tried to use `'url_data'` in the line `html_str = url_data.read().decode('utf8')` expecting it to contain something, it did not even exist. 3) We can safely say that when you tried to set the value of `'url _data'` in the line `url_data = urllib.request.urlopen(my_request)` you failed for some reason. 4) The reason will not be known, because you have suppressed the helpful error message (Exception) with a very broad `except:` clause. As a guideline, try to use more specific except clauses only to catch specific and expected errors. 5) If your program cannot proceed without the value of `'url _data'` , I don't think you can just continue after saying "There was some error opening the URL"; you should quit the program there, using `exit()` . 6) Coming back to the `except:` clause which is suppressing helpful information - if you remove that except clause, you will see the real error message "401 Unauthorized" which indicates you were unable to access [http://lancentral.wellsfargo.com/lc4\_prod/hostdetails.php](http://lancentral.wellsfargo.com/lc4_prod/hostdetails.php) from your script. 7) Since you say you can access that URL using your browser, your browser must be doing something differently than your script - look at the headers the browser is sending, for example in Chrome using Developer tools &gt; Network and clicking on that request, to see the Request headers.. If you send the same request headers you should get the same response. 8) Since that URL is not accessible to me I cannot comment further, but typically you might be authenticating using a username/password, or token authentication, a cookie, etc.

Read the sidebar. This is the wrong subreddit for this content. Every post like this decreases the quality of this sub and the experience of those who come for what it intends to provide.
Yup, someone has to pay for the time to update it
It has to be able to represent everything, if other languages are serializing to JSON. JSON resembles Python dictionaries, and EVERYTHING in Python is/can be represented by a dictionary, so how can there be an abstract data type in Python that can't be represented in JSON?
That doesn't answer the question. Why have we needed all of these different formats when there's one universal format already? Everything in Python is a dictionary and JSON represents dictionaries so every problem that needs dumping in Python should be able to be solved by using JSON. It's also good enough for every other major language.
Pickle can handle multiple references to the same object, any class instance (as long as the actual class has been imported), and a wider variety of data types than JSON. It also predates json, so there’s a historical aspect as well. Pickle is also used for cross-process communication in the multiprocessing module.
Please read the sidebar and don't contribute to the off topic noise already plaguing this subreddit.
Thanks to all responders. For some reason this morning, I could not get through to the site for about 1 hour. Then it was working again.

OK, do a PEP saying that whatever your personal favorite tool is should be the one official recommendation. See how far it gets. The PyPA site can run whatever tutorials they feel like, and they don't have to write a PEP and get signoff from every single person in the community first. If they want to recommend a particular tool for a particular use case -- which is what they did, and what people keep misrepresenting -- that is literally entirely within their remit, and if you don't like it they have public discussion channels available to deliver feedback.

JSON can't even represent sets or Decimal types, let alone custom classes.
Film/TV post softwares maya and nuke have just recently shipped with PySide2, but when they did there wasn’t a straightforward way to deploy a shift to 3 within the interpreter in the software. This industry’s roadmap puts the shift from 2.7 to 3.7 happening 2019-2020 since py3 and Qt for Python are now officially an item. TL;DR, not every industry has the capability to just jump and are limited by application level interpretation.
What a great addition to an already awesome feature. f-strings are great!
I second Zeep as well. A useful feature is the command line tool to query a WSDL file and list the methods and data types. python -mzeep &lt;wsdl&gt; I will note that I’ve seen several SOAP APIs that don’t actually define different commands as different functions/operations (I don’t remember the proper SOAP term), but one or two services that accept another XML document as a single string input, which adds another layer of complexity (but I’m still using Zeep to work with it).
This seems like finally the answer to what I was looking for so thank you! I will investigate tomorrow.
There is some of them , maybe you can find what you need. &amp;#x200B; Kivy : If you want to create cross-platform graphical applications, or just need a very powerful cross-platform GUI , also you can use this gui for phone app. Pyforms : (I dont like that one) but if you need video player, web browser and OpenGL you can use this gui , its very easy to use. &amp;#x200B; PyGObject (a.k.a PyGi) : its use for GNOME applications or a python application for GTK+ &amp;#x200B; PyGUI : you can use this gui for UNIX,MACİNTOSH and WİNDOWS platforms (it is very easy to learn so if you want to start learning gui start with it) &amp;#x200B; PySimpleGUI : best for learning, I started with this gui, it is a cross-platform framework that wraps tkinter &amp;#x200B; I hope that can help you.
:v I wrote the same thing a while back.. Got down votes lul. Actually after the new C++ release and future support for modules/packages, Python can gtfo back in the grass.
There's a difference between directly and indirectly. If your JSON schema records the type and value of your variable separately you can do both. A set's values can be represented by a list and the decimal by text.
Why am I being downvoted for asking a question?
While this does work, and is a decent example of a recursive algorithm, it should be noted that recursion isn't practical for a Fibonacci sequence in Python. In fact, I wouldn't use it for most things unless there was a good reason, because it hogs up memory. Generators are wonderful for numeric sequences (among other things).

All
&gt;universal format Please show to us. I would think YAML, not JSON. But for Python Pickle will be better than YAML.
Yes but JSON is very inefficient (both slow and large). And pickle is very python-specific, so a lot of things support it (Nothing is stopping you from writing a `to_json` method on all your classes, but they will only be on your classes). Also, Python really only has pickle for a binary format, I dont know why you think there are a lot. Most languages actually don't use JSON. It's mostly just JS. [See this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization#Programming_language_support).
I find \`print(f"{name=}")\` is still way too verbose for debugging purposes... If they want to improve print-debugging, they should add something like \[icecream\]([https://github.com/gruns/icecream](https://github.com/gruns/icecream)) to the standard library.
You either have no idea what you're talking about or are being intentionally difficult. Serialize a function, decision tree, or any other type of classifier, in JSON for us.
The genesis of pickle was in 1994 (https://stackoverflow.com/a/27325007). That's why pickle was originally chosen versus JSON. Cause JSON didn't exist.

It's not only multiplication. Addition too. On my machine: $ python -m timeit -s 'x = 57' 'x * 2' 10000000 loops, best of 5: 21.8 nsec per loop $ python -m timeit -s 'x = 57' 'x &lt;&lt; 1' 10000000 loops, best of 5: 38.5 nsec per loop $ python -m timeit -s 'x = 57' 'x + x' 10000000 loops, best of 5: 22.4 nsec per loop I ran into this issue when I thought I was being smart bit-fiddling for performance. I don't know enough about CPython internals to answer myself, but I found an answer [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37053379/times-two-faster-than-bit-shift-for-python-3-x-integers) that might be enlightening. tl;dr: Integers in Python are arbitrary-precision, so left-shifts (unnecessarily) prepare for a larger integer object to be stored, while multiplication of small numbers is optimised to avoid this.

In any case, the difference you've demonstrated here in this single example seems very minor. &amp;#x200B; If you want to pin down the reason for the small discrepancy, to begin with you'd probably have to delve into the implementations of these methods to see if there's an obvious answer lurking at the surface (I'm assuming you're using CPython): * [long\_mul](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.7/Objects/longobject.c#L3548-L3569) (special case for single-digit numbers, then Karatsuba multiplication) * [long\_lshift](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.7/Objects/longobject.c#L4337-L4385) (divmod/masking algorithm by Tim Peters) &amp;#x200B; ...Unfortunately it's almost impossible to reason about why/how one method might be faster than the other here just by looking at the (very different) algorithms used. You'd want to use performance tools to analyse memory allocations, the underlying instructions your CPU is running, caching effects, and so on and so on. I guess I'm trying to say there (probably isn't) a simple answer or even a general answer. &amp;#x200B; As an aside, it's better to use the `timeit` module (or the `%timeit` magic if using iPython) for measuring time taken to execute code.

Definitely your formatting, which makes your code really hard to read. But you also want to compare the variable (==) and not assign a value to it (=)
Probably just space between = and ". Also parenthesis are unnecessary.
Unfortunately their’s none. That’s one of the big issues with Python.
A python dictionary can have int, tuple, etc as key while in JSON it has to be string.
1. /r/learnpython 2. Please provide your code as properly-formatted text 3. The highlighted line is doing an assignment instead of a comparison (you're using `=` instead of `==`)
tnx for helping im new
&gt; See how far it gets. And? There are very good reasons for which a lot of people cannot agree on this topic. They will not disappear by arbitrary edict, which is basically what PyPA and Reitz tried to do. They will certainly not improve by pushing a half-baked solution that ended up there simply because of the name of its chief lobbyist, so to speak. &gt; The PyPA site can run whatever tutorials they feel like That tutorial ended up linked in stdlib docs. The bar for that should be a bit higher than “first tutorial from a funny friend”, certainly so when it becomes a de-facto bypass of the PEP process to impose a tool in a historically contentious area. Now it’s just “a tutorial”, but the original wording was much more prescriptive, on the lines of “this is the tool you *should* use”, despite the tool not being good enough; and pipenv docs presented the package similarly as “the PyPA-recommended tool”. That combination effectively put pressure on anyone not using pipenv to adopt it, despite its shortcomings. &gt; if you don't like it they have public discussion channels available to deliver feedback. I don’t *want* to know what channels they have; if something is in stdlib and it effectively defines how one should work, it should have a PEP, end of. Anyway, it’s pointless rehashing this conversation: PyPA people admitted mistakes were made, the tutorial was amended and unlinked from stdlib (as far as I can see), Reitz was basically forced to lose the bombast, and hopefully some lessons were learnt.
Basically any immutable object will work as a key in python dict like frozenset etc. Another thing is JSON need python tuple to be converted to list. JSON does not have tuples.
This is incorrect. He's doing an assignment inside the if statement instead of a comparison. This is absolutely basic usage of `=` versus `==`.
You can't represent NaN (not a number) or inf in JSON which are valid float values.
You can't represent references in JSON. For example in python you can have three dicts a ={'foo': b} where b = {'bar': a}. Now you have cyclic data structure. You can't represent this in JSON.
gender = "male" or "female" will just be True if it is male or female, not one of them so the comparison in line 19 is True== "male
Btw yaml has references. XML has references.

Are you concerned about the memory consumed by the \`sv.frames\` list? This snippet appends to that list without removing anything, so it grows forever (until there's 10 frames, and the program exits, at which point all the memory is freed).
It is `True` no matter what because both `"male"` and `"female"` [equate to True](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing).
Hey! I'm excited for us. I hope to see you all post more often. It's cool to see others on the same journey.
I’ll check it out! is it as pretty as the new Windows Terminal? I’ve been using Hyper for awhile and I love how it looks
A chatbot with sqlite3
This is going to be very good for windows!
It’s not possible. First, there are a lot of package downloads, so it’s hosted on BigQuery because it needs to scale. The “design” of the table is not optimal to do these queries. You literally have to do a “select COUNT(*) FROM WHERE ...”, which results in a table scan. It will take a couple of minutes and cost you at least $50 And even if you’re willing to pay the $50 of the query, there’s no way for PyPi to differentiate a users “pip install” from a build system’s. That’s why those numbers are not published anymore.
That sounds so useful and yet also makes me feel slightly uncomfortable for some reason. The variable name becoming part of its content feels weird.
No walrus operator yet?
Absolutely great talk... I am so glad I went to Pycon 2019.
We have an embedded jython interpreter in our java application and there is no jython 3 yet.
&gt;That doesn't answer the question. Yeah, it does. &gt;Why have we needed all of these different formats when there's one universal format already? A universal format for what? Therein lies the rub. As stated elsewhere in this post, JSON can't represent everything.
It’s pulled in all my packages installed by pip (Python 2.7) but none installed by pip3. I’m only just figuring out Python and it’s envs so it’s entirely possible I’ve missed something. Will keep digging.
I like the ``f"{x=}"`` proposal. An idea: let ``f"{x==}" also return the file name and line number in the print, e.g. with x=1 it would fold out to ``"my_file.py:42: x=1"`` could also be useful for debugging and logging.
I’m new but I am working on a snake game lmao.
It's already available from 3.8a1
Well, I figure that's a matter of how you want to configure it. I'm not sure it's as pretty out of the box as Hyper, but it's probably more stable.
Might want to head over to /r/learnpython and also learn about `datetime` and `string` and what you can do with those. from datetime import datetime times = [ datetime.strptime(t, "%H:%M%p").strftime("%H%M") for t in my_time_string.split(" - ")] startTime = times[0] endTime = times[1]
Ah, I thought this was the highlights since 3.7. Thanks.
Indeed, especially when you copy paste code from to other text editors, try to compile it, and then gcc tells you it doesn't understand this character. This one is obvious, but when it's a "..." replaced with one character, you pull your hair wondering why your macro doesn't work.
DHH. I have mad respect for his views on business and how he has run his company. I am utterly bewildered by his many (terrible) opinions on writing software.
Install it for your account only, by checking `Install just for me` in the installer. Then you can use any editor you want.
Yes, absolutely correct! A fitting analogy would be a nice picture hanging on the inside of a prison cell. Every inmate would love it, but every person on the outside would be like "Wtf is so great about this picture?!".
Yes but you can't upgrade if you're using ndb among some other standard packages !
I’m trying to finish my thesis paper right now. As a social scientist, I only used python for text mining, data cleaning, and running some basic statistical tests. But I really enjoy learning how to use python to solve some easy problems since I see how convenient this tool can be.
PEP 572. A horrible idea made real.
Yes, that makes total sense now.
Sounds like Donald Trump.
wxPython FTW
Then don’t use it. No one’s making you.
Made a script that parses spreadsheets and creates appended ones based on column fields for important rules and a summary report for ease of statistics for non technical decision makers. First real script I’ve written. Very excited.
While that's a good sentiment, I spend more time reading code from others than I do writing it. So it will be forced upon me.
This is interesting because the original json implementation, iirc, had an optional "references" so `a` would serialize to: {"foo": {"bar": {"$ref": "$"}}} Where `$` is a path to `a` and `$["b"]` is a path to `b`.
But you already know what it does and how it works, so it sounds like the hard part for you is already over. What is it about that operator that you dislike so much?
Not even a good shit post.
Your code is not even doing any multiplication or bit shifts. Each iteration of the loop constant value is loaded and then popped from the stack. Wrap the code you posted here in a multiline string and pass it to dis.dis
It's a little nope rope
Did you learnt something new?

Idk, what's wrong with print("name="+name)?
Python will replace constant expressions with a single constant if it can. For instance "2 * 3" will be replaced with 6. This happens at import time, so when your code runs no multiplication is actually performed. Search for "peephole optimizer" if you want to know more.
JSON can represent anything, but so can strings. This is a non-sequitur.
It's healthy to critique features of a language.
If you haven’t listened to a Hettinger talk before, five him a chance. He’s an outstanding teacher... for my money, one of the best in not just the Python community, but all of tech.
Lol just discovered icecream with your comment looks amazing!
While you can utilize them in idle, you shouldn't. You should create a text file. When you save, you save as a .py file. You can call them in your main.py file file that you'll call from the command line.
I think this depends on your personal preference. Personally, I still find programming fun after a few years of full time work. That said, a lot of work as a programmer doesn’t involve programming, and can focus more on design, documentation or operations. If you feel you’re tired of programming, there are other things you can do as a developer to support your team, although programming will probably always be at least some part of your work. In my experience, most people want to spend more time programming, not less.
You might be ibterested in r/learnpython
XTerm was released 35 years ago
Can’t blame him.
If it looks ugly, it looks ugly. I can read PHP, but I am not going to enjoy doing it.
Print(locals())
Yes, it's awesome! I hope some day Python will have something like `ic()` as a builtin next to `print()`.
It certainly is! So, what’s the critique?
That’s so subjective, though. Having used that for years — decades, even — in C and then Go, I must’ve wished for this syntax a thousand times. I personally think it’s beautiful and it will help me to write more beautiful, visually scannable code.
It's fine when you have one variable but starts to become unwieldy when you build up a lot of concatenated strings (via indexing operations, for example).
Great, thanks!
Yeah. Social media is toxic as fuck nowdays. A lot of people just become assholes when there isn't a human face in front of them to trigger empathy.
https://github.com/lckr/jupyterlab-variableInspector
&gt; Print(locals()) Thank you!
&gt; https://github.com/lckr/jupyterlab-variableInspector Thanks! I'll check that out if I need even more info than the print(locals()) thing gives.
`print(locals())` and `print(globals())` will sure give you a ton of info. But don't know if it'll be of much use. Are you using JupyterLab?
He is the owner of the trademark and name. No matter what the license says with respect to copyright he came up with the name requests, and if he wanted to he could bar others from using it.
*De gustibus non disputandum est*, absolutely, which is why I objected to the statement that the problem is in learning the syntax - it just isn’t, the problem is that it just doesn’t fit the Python aesthetic very well. Otherwise there would be no argument. There is a reason Python has not had this sort of thing for 28 years. C and Go also use curly braces for block delimiters, and I’m sure there are plenty of now-Python developers who would love to have something like that in Python too - that alone is not a great argument. I for one am very sad at the continuous encroaching of special characters on what used to be almost pure English.
Jesus Slashdot comments are terrible.
No, that's exactly what I needed for what I'm doing now. I'm not using JupyterLab, I don't think anyway. I just boot jupyter notebook from the command line.
Some people are just abominable when they know they can get away with it. The number of people who are despicable to retail employees and waitstaff at restaurants is staggering.

Ignoring the general opinion on the core developers mailing list, forcing the assignment expression PEP through wasn't really that smart a move. Eventually the frustration spilled over into other media. I still wonder why Guido chose that hill to die on.

Ditto, but i missed this talk. I went out of the room for few mins to take a call from my mgr and they closed the room coz of capacity. Thx for post.
Check out Pythonista.
Just use some normal IDE like pycharm or at least Jupiter.
ELI5?
unfortunately the scientific mode is only available at the pro edition level, using the community edition prevents me from being able to use it, I've been looking for a good solution to the same problem OP, the best i've gotten was being directed towards using the debugging functionality built into pycharm
Pythonista 3. If you want jupyter notebook try “Juno”.
Absolutely agree, he is great, and knows his stuff, even if he has an odd turn of phrase. One quick question, is he giving us this code? :)
Dunno, but I can confirm that I see same size as you.
This pretty much perfectly sums up my thoughts on the matter.
Amen. He's saying there wasn't an honest debate, but he was shutting down honest debate. The Python-2-forever crowd ran roughshod for almost ten years but this was the issue he put his foot down on. It is baffling.
Yeah we can and did. He shut down debate and now is complaining that people were "questioning my authority or the wisdom of my decisions" in a venue he couldn't control? The peasants rose up and overthrow their otherwise beloved dictator. Now if they go ahead with that assignment expression the whole core team has to be tossed out too. THE REVOLUTION MUST NOT HAVE BEEN IN VAIN.
It was the final straw that made Guido Van Rossum step down as BDFL. That alone makes me not like it. But I'll probably find a good use for it someday and then forget all about that. :)
Mac or PC?
Oh yeah I probably should have said that. It's on PC Windows 10.
re: &gt;There is new syntax (the “walrus operator”, :=) to assign values to variables as part of an expression. Example: &gt; . if (n := len(a)) &gt; 10: Funny. I thought that idea had been rejected and that is what caused Guido to retire as BDFL (I never thought he should have resigned over one tiny controversy in 23 years.. )
“Slides” and code here: https://rhettinger.github.io/
&gt; And why there is an ad for a free terminal application? Because they have the budget and more people working on the Open Source project maybe will help with the point of making it Open Source
Now that's he's gone, can we finally remove the requirement for unnecessary colons in for loops and if statements?
Holy shit, right?! Like right out the gate.... Instant shit storm
Yikes. I don’t know what is more disturbing, Kenneth and his ego or the fact that you spent so much time working on that comment for something that literally does not matter.
Saynomore, saynomore
Hello, I'm working on a program that calculates compounded interest: &gt;p = 10000 &gt; &gt;r = 0.08 &gt; &gt;n = 12 &gt; &gt;user\_input\_1 = int(input("Compounded interest depends on the number of years\\nof your investment. Please enter the number of years: ") &gt; &gt;fx = p\*(1+(r/n))\*\*(n\*user\_input\_1) &gt; &gt;print("If $10,000 is the initial amount invested, then $", fx , "is earned after", user\_input\_1 ,"years.") I get a syntax error (Python 3.7.3) for the variable fx when I try to run the code, yet it calculates when I run the formula for fx in the shell (variables are replaced with real numbers). &amp;#x200B; What seems to be the issue? Any feedback is appreciated.
Did they removed the GIL?
Are PyCharm or IDLE installed? If they are, you might try installing through them
Can you execute python code? If you can execute python code, you could use the subprocess module in a python script to execute pip.
No, Guido accepted it as his last act as BDFL
It’s not that hard to be more stable than Hyper

My pleasure.
Try installing anaconda python for just you and not the whole computer. It doesn’t require admin privileges at my work. Also windows 10. That may set you up with a command prompt called anaconda prompt.
Ok thanks I think this is what I will try tomorrow.
"Son, I don't get up every day and go to a place called 'fun'. I get up and go to a place called 'work'."
A library to speed up CLI apps by spawning a forking server. The initial invocation adds 120ms but after the first time new invocations reach user code in 70ms. That's on a hosted CI server where a plain `python -c ''` takes 20ms so hopefully it is faster on everyday hardware.
I do data analysis on variables with names longer than 79 characters (they're messages in a physical routing). So my case is not the norm but just remember that there are reasons why the whole 80 character limit is too restrictive
That’s not really a python question, but I’m an aerospace engineer. XLRF5 I think it’s called is the successor to XFOIL and does 3D. OpenVSP does as well. As a bonus, it has an api, but I just use the command line from python.
Anaconda has a GUI called Anaconda Navigator . Not sure if it’s always included. I never use it.
For desktop GUIs, you’re looking at PyQt/PySide, wxpython, and tkinter. For touch, there’s kivy. For web, there flask and other things...not a web guy. My favorite is qt.
The website itself doesn't need any credentials to be supplied but the browser must be launched as admin to be able to access the website.
&gt;I have a project, basically a computer vision application that detects a person and tell you their age, gender, emotion, quite accurately if I may add. so they expect you to develop something along the lines of facial recognition software? &gt;...the expectations from the company are quite high considering I am a fresh grad. well this is a backwards ass statement if I've ever heard one. wtf kind of company is this?
Inslee was a progressive before it was mainstream just like Idle was all about Python before it was what all the cool kids did ;)
I had forgottten ./ still existed. It was a great site in its day but has become a shell of its former self. Too bad, spent years there.
The browser usually needs to have admin rights to be able to open the site. I am running the Python as admin too, assuming that's enough. but it didn't help.

I don’t understand why this is so favoured. Couldn’t you just do `print(name)` and just… remember that you printed `name`? Can’t see myself doing `print(f"{name=}")` over just `print(name)` for debugging purposes.
"So much time". It was five minutes. It matters quite a lot, when someone steals 30k and might get away with it.
I suspect this is some sort of vpn or corporate intranet problem, which is not going to be solvable by anyone outside of it. The launch browser as admin, should be meaningless, the internet doesn't care what permissions your browser has on your machine. What does care is other processes on your machine, which could feasibly prevent network traffic based on the processes permission level.

Oh no the facial recognition software already exists, they want me to create a GUI for it in order to allow users to register their faces onto a db. The facial recognition software will be a executable software (you will be able to install it on to your pc) I also have to wrap my head around that... Yeah, company seems to be requesting a bit too much. I don't want to say no though or this is too much, I usually say I'll take a look at it.
I'll also somehow have to implement the database, and link it to the system .... shit

I often need to print name={name} because I'm inspecting a bunch of variables and not just one. Put that into a for loop and things get unweildy quite quickly if you don't label the variables you are inspecting.

My lunch hour project today was getting way too excited about the Circuit Playground Express I got at Pycon. My first time ever programming a microprocessor. First easy idea I had was to create a programmable round timer for jiu jitsu sparring. Press the B button to set the number of minutes with one LED lighting up for each minute. Then hit A and it lights up green, switching to red and beeping a few times when the round is up. I had a ton of fun working on it! I'd also love to program something crypto currency related for my tutorial site as a proof of concept. But, it might not be the most applicable thing and not a whole lot of cryptography is well supported. Bouncing around ideas for educational projects.
Oh that’s pretty cool, thanks!

Not everyone's well suited to working in the current social climate; some people just aren't good fits, sadly enough.
I'm super tired at the moment but if I can remember in the morning I'll try and take a look :)
I have a reason to think it's still the admin account. As an employee, we get a standard account and another with admin privileges. If I open the same website with standard account, it'll show me a message that I don't have required authorization. It'll work if I launch it from browser as admin.
Writing functions that manipulate predefined lists. As an example, my instructor wrote the US States as follows; AK Alaska AL Alabama CO Colorado etc all the states. Then we are asked to write a function that returns only the initials but in reverse order. Or return only the first and last letter of the entire state name. Things like that.
Your professor is giving you homework like this or putting it on tests that you have to write on paper?
More like I wonder why after thirty years of steering it alone, he didn't feel like doing it another thirty.
I can't take a library like icecream seriously with a name like that. &amp;#x200B; I use to give ruby more flack for things like VCR or Resqueue but those actually self-describe the library more then "icecream". Is Python becoming mainstream enough a bunch of brogrammers are flooding the pypi index?
Even the lightest of straws can break a camel's back.
I was thinking about XLRF5, but I don't know how to use it in python or command line.
Any links to core devs vaguebooking about certain BDFLs implementing certain aquatic operators?
For a little bit of context: a lot of python internals are just dictionaries. In some languages like C, there is a concept of stack vs heap and pass by value vs pass by reference semantics; you pass by value for things on the stack, and by reference for things on the heap. From the CPython docs, CPython does not have a stack, and is only heap: &gt; Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures. The management of this private heap is ensured internally by the Python memory manager. The Python memory manager has different components which deal with various dynamic storage management aspects, like sharing, segmentation, preallocation or caching. Python is best thought of as "pass by object." Some objects, like integers, behave like pass by value since it is difficult (not impossible) to manipulate the data behind them. Others, like dictionaries, behave like pass by reference since you have a handle or reference to this easily mutable data structure. globals and locals are special functions that return the dictionaries containing all of the global and all of the local variables, resp. When you write a line of code that creates a new variable, it is inserted into the dictionary and when you replace ("shadow") the value, it is overwritten. Similarly, sys.modules is just a dictionary mapping module names to module objects, which are themselves just classes. The [source](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/29500737d45cbca9604d9ce845fb2acc3f531401/Python/bltinmodule.c#L1602) of locals is very simple.
How about you guys calm down
Yeah. I'm a noob compared to most on here, but I know exactly where to look for those functions in the docs if I weren't able to nail it off the top of my head. The biggest problem I have with most things is to verbosely write the steps I want to do in English. Sounds like with that test they've done the hard part already.
Nice
Mac comes with 2.7, Homebrew (like apt for Mac) has 3.7.
It got bumped specially for the ability to run \`print(f"{name=}")\` over \`print(name)\`. &amp;#x200B; f strings aren't pythonic or anything but that's way better then fixing the broken import system :D
It's like doing your laundry, taking out the garbage, or picking trash up. If you don't, eventually you can't even live in your environment anymore, and everyone will judge the hell out of you.

JSON only can handle string, integer, float, dict and list. Pickle can pack arbitrary objects. It goal is that you can take object of your class and store it in the disk, most commonly I see it used for caching application data between runs, but it has other uses (for example for storing configuration).

I make that part of the log format. Module, line, and thread.
For new people, I recommend anaconda.com and VS Code (with the python extension).
Uh, it really bothers you that much? The language is named after Monty Python. Also tons of libraries have names that mean nothing, in every language. Just off the top of my head, Electron, Spring, Vue.js, etc. None of those self-describe at all.
No one talking about BPO 35813 from the change notes? Looks like that one's gonna make IPC way easier and more Pythonic, which is gonna be awesome to use. That's the one I'm excited for but I don't see anyone in here discussing it
You just put the source code in a long JSON string, easy. /s
I'd argue that a release that's almost a decade old is not more stable than newer releases, just because it's older.
You are missing a closing parenthesis in the user input: `user_input_1 = int(input("Compounded interest depends on the number of years\nof your investment. Please enter the number of years: ")) # &lt;- the last parenthesis`

While that's true, I think there's unlikely to be a serious language out there without a JSON library freely available. If you're sending data from one language to another it's a very reasonable format. If you're sending from python to python, pickle is great.
I hope, but don't feel like this needs a /s... So with that in mind, I can see uses for the walrus operator. Seems like it'll have it's uses and can make the code easier to read by better defining context of variable scope.
Any big company that has been using python for 15 years likely has a shit ton of 2.6 and 2.7 to support still, and maybe has internal tools that can't handle 3.x. The 2 to 3 move is not trivial, even for a single project, let alone a company that has been using 2.6/2.7 for years and building their infrastructure with it. Sometimes it really is easier to just use 2.7 rather than make waves at a job. Luckily I've avoided this but I've seen it in the past.
Didn't you just represent it? ["a":{"foo", b}, "b":{"bar":a}]
I can. "NaN", "inf"
So what's the problem? Again, one entry to store type, another to store value and you use a list to store the tuple values.
No. Again, why downvote someone for asking a question?
You're hooked on the idea that JSON has to have every type. You just store things as strings and **decode** them when you deserialize. Again, like every other language does it. https://pythontic.com/serialization/json/introduction I'm not going crazy here.
My first "real" Python project. Up until now had just played with some scripts here and there, mostly for personal use. Work is letting me do a new project in Python. Basically infrastructure for a reporting server. FastAPI on the Python side. Lots of AWS on the back-end (Redshift, DynamoDB, SQS). It's a blast. But also a little overwhelming thinking about the things that I need to do on a "real" project that I'm doing for my company versus random personal scripts here and there. But overall, lovin' it.
Guido didn't resign due to the feature but because of the incivility of the discussion.
That's not a valid json.
Sure you can represent it, we could also store everything in a JSON string, but then aren't you inventing your own protocol?
I hope they just replace GIL with something better and make Python faster than it is in version 4.0
I can see the value in it. I’m just a bit surprised at the overwhelming enthusiasm for it, and, accordingly, surprised that many people like writing `print("arg1=" + arg1, "arg2=" + arg2)`. I personally very rarely do this.
You would do yourself a favor if you would use protobuf or thrift for that. JSON is not fast to parse, it's not compact, it would redeem itself if it was human readable, but it isn't. The only reason it is popular is because it comes with JavaScript which is in every browser. If you do frontend developement, you probably don't have choice, but use it.
What makes you think numpy won't work with it. I see that there is no wheel package available yet on PyPi, but sdist is so python should be able to compile it on installation.
If i do pip install numpy, i get a bunch of errors... how can i compile it on installation?
Python Processing source code is [on github](https://github.com/aaronpenne/generative_art/tree/master/circlish_circle_perlin)
I actually think that’s a good thing.

It was a good site but then everyone left for digg and other places and eventually came to reddit and hackernews. The only one left on slashdot and grumpy old cynical farts.
vscode is not even close to pycharm
I wish him nothing but the best in retirement.
JSON cannot differentiate Python's tuple, list, set, frozenset etc. datatypes. Every formats other than pickle (msgpack, yaml etc.) are just to interoperate with other languages (which also don't understand the data types above), they are not alternatives for pickle.
There are some open datasets available from the stock exchange (https://www.kaggle.com/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs) you could play around with those
Sure they can { "Var1": "tuple(1,2)", "Var2":"set(1,2)" } Alternatively: { "Var1": {"type":"tuple","data":"1,2"}, "Var2":{"type":"set","data":"1,2"} }
Beautiful. Thanks for sharing the code.
What disappoints me is how seriously people take twitter. As if some dumbass posting something means *everyone* agrees with it, and worse, said dumbass is posting something in a way that passive-aggressively says "I don't like your decisions, but I'm too much of a coward to say it to your face." Repeat after me, friends: If someone's posting on Twitter, they're the drunk at the end of the bar at 4AM. Ignore them like the waste of space they are, or send them to therapy. Don't act like it's a goddamn media frenzy.
I'd like to hang out in Raymond Hettings bar https://twitter.com/raymondh/status/1125487457443532800 There's not much 4AM drunkenness over this one, neither any other of his tweets, really.
Hey. Be nice, you intolerable youth.
Then, you are making more complicated to validate and parse it. Then, what is the point of over-complicating JSON instead of just using pickle, without the need to parse those "type", "data" metadata?
I think people leaving for Digg improved Slashdot in the short term by reducing the number of easy comments. I've not been there much recently to say how it is has played out.
&gt; A lot of people just become assholes when there isn't a human face in front of them to trigger empathy. They were always assholes; but too chicken shit to be that way face to face.
Use the API? This is about as service-specific as you could get... Really nothing I can do to help you
typing.NamedTuple appears to overlap with data classes.
D is a pretty solid language

I thought this was about Python, not Perl.
To be fair, Zed Shaw was part of the Python community, too.
Any chance you could share the code? Sounds interesting
This looks really cool but can someone ELI5 what I am looking at? Thanks for sharing the code, but I don't quite understand what it is doing
Basically, there are 2 possibilities: subscription/webhooks and polling. If you can check for particular event periodically using API, then you can do it. As an example: Telegram bot allows to set webhooks, so that Telegram will send new messages to your REST API when they emerge, otherwise, you can periodically check their endpoint for new messages.
Take a look at the mature parts of the standard library. There are relative few places where assignment expressions would actually make a change. In most cases there is already a well-establish way of achieving the same effect without. To my knowledge, there are no more than a handful of idioms that cannot be simplified without an assignment expression. Many felt that those gains were not enough to justify changing the language.
Since you're a beginner, you might also want to check out the Arcade library: [http://arcade.academy/](http://arcade.academy/)
But you would have had to install a component containing something like MSYS or Cygwin to provide that bash environment in the first place. WSL takes it a bit further with a dedicated subsystem as opposed to porting just the runtime 🙂
Thanks for the info!
Have this exact issue but on K8s.. Any luck sorting it out?
thank you ,you are very good!
Great advice except Flask doesn't do the GUI. It's a backend. When doing Web stuff, the visual stuff is done in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Whilst template languages like Jinja2 allow you to do some GUI building in a Python like DSL it's not enough to say that Flask let's you build GUIs.
Yeah me too. Overall though I've had a good experience and it does what it says
Just some system parts. I do not have all the bash functions now, i.e. apt-get. This is true, it did install some of them. However, I did not install MSYS nor Cygwin. This emulator is cmder, nothing else ;) This subsystem scares me. My windows is a *** without it even. Installing additional subsystems will make it unable to operate.
congratulations. Kindly write a full story that how you got the job and how you have done it, this will inspire newbie programmers and they will also get motivation from it.
Nice try, Craigslist data monkey.
Have you ever used it? In my opinion it really, really sucks. I use Pycharm as my default Python IDE (also for Javascript and Web stuff), but it's scientific mode and integration with Jupyter Lab/Jupyter Notebooks is truly shit. They recently made a lot of noise about their total redesign but it's even more broken than the broken mess it was. Pycharm is the best Python IDE by a large margin, but it's scientific mode and Jupyter integrations are so bad that its best to pretend they don't exist.
Yeah it's sad. I used to go there mostly for the comments, but nowadays I just browse the site once every couple days to see if I missed any news, and generally don't click on any of the articles because I would just be disappointed by the overwhelming amount of stupid :-(
Ah shit

bump ... I realize the question is vague. I truly do. I just need to get a discussion going so I can get a grasp of what I need to do and propose, maybe even change their minds if its not feasible.
&gt;peasants Perfectly describes who did it and will now cry about who's going to implement what they want because all they ever contribute to anything is "spreading the word".
Yeah in the early 2000s it had a cutting edge comment system: your comments would be given a score by other readers, and if you consistently had a good score you would be given "karma" which would give new comments a bonus point. This was a huge step up from the standard forum system used everywhere else and paved the way for digg and reddit, who did it better.
I'm a complete beginner. But I stumbled across this article... https://towardsdatascience.com/build-your-first-chatbot-using-python-nltk-5d07b027e727 I think I'm going to tinker with a simple chatbot program. Could be fun!
I wish this sentiment was more widespread. I blame the media for reporting on every twitter scandal as if it matters. In the past we didn't know what random people thought about every issue: but now suddenly it's so important it becomes part of every news story.
Vue = View. It's a view/rendering library. I'll give you the other two though
I am writing a simple "open this directory in bash prompt" utility in Python for Windows 10 WSL. I know Microsoft has released a solution in insider versions, but mine is mine and it will be ready this week. Of course I will publish it on Github and planning to make a simple installer with InnoSetup.
PyQt supports Android and iOS too.
This tweet is inaccurate. `all` uses short-circuiting in both cases.
Yes, used to be my fav site of all really.
NamedTuple are immutable
I wonder if the vitrol was aimed at him or some of the douchebags who are involved in python development. I watched a video where the guy made sure to point out every feature he made. He tried to do it tongue and cheek, but he was an annoying smarmy blowhard. Stand near people like that and you are sure to catch some of the rotten fruit the angry villagers throw their way.
here we go again
The list comprehension doesn't short circuit. And that's the point Raymond makes here. If you unfold the thread, his explanation is much better than mine.
Something weird happened where suddenly articles on a few narrow topics would just keep popping up over and over. These were topics that would never naturally pass the general biases of the /. crowd so were certainly being "promoted". Yet they didn't feel like paid adverts.
I use Wagtail for that these days, also nice it will handle the image resizing for you, I would highly recommend it over plain-old Django. I had a look at your template, it looks like you're putting a bit too much logic in the template layer, splitting a string on the dot, subtraction, etc, that is all view logic really, it's too much logic for the template layer.
I understand his point, but his first tweet sounds like clickbait. This has nothing to do with the behavior of all
Exactly LMAO
I think you're in a small minority that can read this as a tweet about any or all. &gt;The any() and all() builtins have short-circuiting behavior, **but that is lost if you use a list comprehension**: The emphasis is mine.
I don’t get the hate on the aquatic operator. Can someone explain to me?
Tested in nix terminals: `pip uninstall $(pip freeze)` Common place used by popular libraries is `$HOME/.virtualenvs` The bot might ask you to post these kind of questions to /r/learnpython
The short-circuiting behavior of any() and all() is **not** lost when you use a list. Those functions will short-circuit over the list. I see the relevance of the overall observation, but it is badly formulated and could make inexperienced coders think that the behavior of any() or all() is altered depending on its argument. It is not. If you build a list, then the list is gonna be built, and this has nothing to do with all().
You still don't get it? The entire list have to be made, before all iterates over it, meaning that with a list comprehension **all** elements are evaluated. The short circuit of all() only come into play after the list have been finalized.
Asssignment expressions, aka. walrus operator.
LMFAOO do people not google their problem before hiring somebody??
I know that. But why the hate on it ?
Thanks!, I was super confused.
Use the sub process.call method.
I think you’re misunderstanding his wording - he’s saying that any and all will still short circuit regardless. The building of the complete list vs using a generator is a completely separate feature of python. You’re only saving some iteration time versus saving the actual memory of the list but either way any and all will short circuit.
Can you give some examples of actual hate?
This week, I'm working on a data entry automation for a certain platform that doesn't have a proper API to do certain things, using Selenium. There's task that is really tedious that me and my team-mates do that takes about half an hour each time and it's just a PIA. I'm almost done. Just need to figure out that last step which involves sliders and such that I'm having a hard time ascertaining which tag/objects I need to latch onto to do those final damn [object.click](https://object.click)() - lots of fun. Also doing my first Tkinter implementation. Most of the people who want to use my stuff aren't too command-line friendly so will do a mini framework for my tools around Tkinter so they can have a standard GUI to work with next ..
I can see it being useful for e.g. `__repr__()` and `__str__()` implementations. In the scenario you point out, excluding the name of the variable might work in the short term, but imagine coming back after a few weeks (Hell, maybe even days), running the tests, and just seeing some random values pop up with no information about what they relate to.
Can confirm, just went full 'see this guy is making money, get your ass back to practice'
With polite disrespect: You're also missing the point. There will never be any good reason to create an ephemeral list. Short-circuiting a list of what's essentially scalars at the time of all() or any(), is never going to make up for the time spent in allocating the list, performing possible expensive computations. Keeping stuck in the misconception that this is about all, and not about avoiding ephemeral lists are a failure to read what Raymonds tweet was about.
I get that. The original commenter was saying that that could be misleading. Anyways, I think we both understand each other
Assuming this is helping somebody out who has no idea how to actually drive a computer. First problem is what do they search for? They have no clue what grep is either, so even if they hit the right results they'll skim over something like this.
Good idea
That's cool, but it does not do the same thing as they said their code does.

&gt; I was and still am a principal engineer at Dropbox, which is actually where I spend most of my time. Let's not forget that the language creator spent more than 3 years porting that codebase from Python2 to Python3: https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2018/09/how-we-rolled-out-one-of-the-largest-python-3-migrations-ever/ You know how they say that the business of business is business? Looks like the business of Python is porting between incompatible variants of the language.
cringe comment bro
&gt; It's disappointing to see bad naming conventions take over. What sort of "naming convention" is icecream? It's funny, I never even dreamed that someone would care about the name of a package unless it was really long and untypeable. If I had a top ten list of key features for a package (reliable, well-documented, feature full, etc) then "has a serious name" would not be on there. Indeed, "icecream"'s name is only positive - easy to spell, quite short, and I love ice cream. tl; dr: turn that frown upside down a live a little, you dried up old stick! ;-)
You likely can use PyQt or other GUI framework that has Python bindings. The tricky part would be to use a propper widget to handle webcam/whatevercam to display the image from it (assuming person facing it) and then just grabing the data and feeding it to the face recognition software/etc. Do note that it might end up not purely Python - if you would need a custom widget without PyQt bindings or when QtQuick and a bit of C++ will look much better for you.
Congrats!
That doesn't work if name isn't a string, eh? (Sure, you can use `%s`) Also, in production code I simply never have any print statements - not "very few" but "none", to the point where I have a flake8 rule that prevents them. Oh, I use print almost every day - for debugging! But that means I'm creating and destroying debugging print statements all the time. So it's a little timesaver to write: print(f'{foo=} {bar=} {baz=} {bing=}') (38 characters) over print('foo=', foo, 'bar=', bar, 'baz=', baz, 'bing=', bing) (59 characters)
I'm on your side here in this general debate, but the specific idea of serializing a function fills me with fear and trembling. I mean, what happens when that function changes in later versions of the code - then you have two versions lying around! If I need to serialize a function, I serialize the full path to the function - e.g. `math.sqrt`. u/alcade is being pretty dogmatic, which is why the downvotes (yes, I helped there :-D) but in practice, if I actually serialize something for long-term storage, I don't use pickle because it isn't guaranteed to be stable between versions (even minor versions IIRC, though AFAIK in practice pickle hasn't actually changed between minor versions in as long as I've been keeping track).
Not in Python! Can I read it? &gt;&gt;&gt; json.loads('["a":{"foo", b}, "b":{"bar":a}]') Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/json/__init__.py", line 354, in loads return _default_decoder.decode(s) File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/json/decoder.py", line 339, in decode obj, end = self.raw_decode(s, idx=_w(s, 0).end()) File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/json/decoder.py", line 355, in raw_decode obj, end = self.scan_once(s, idx) json.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 5 (char 4) No. Can I write it? &gt;&gt;&gt; a = {}; b = {'bar': a}; a['foo'] = b &gt;&gt;&gt; json.dumps(a) json.dumps(a) Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/json/__init__.py", line 231, in dumps return _default_encoder.encode(obj) File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/json/encoder.py", line 199, in encode chunks = self.iterencode(o, _one_shot=True) File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/json/encoder.py", line 257, in iterencode return _iterencode(o, 0) ValueError: Circular reference detected No.
This would be pretty cool
Yes, they don't. If you don't realize what computers are actually good at, you don't even think to look for an automated way.
What are some useful applications you are thinking of?
&gt; You can't represent references in JSON. I'm basically agreeing with you, but you can perfectly well _represent_ references in JSON - I've done it. It's a pain in the ass - you need to have some sort of naming convention in your JSON then preprocess your structure or (what I did) have some sort of facade over it so it emits the reference names instead of the actual data - and then reverse it on the way out. (And we had to do it - because pickle isn't compatible between versions. Heck, I think that was written in Python 2!) So it's _doable_ - but which is easier when you need to store something temporarily? with open('foo.pcl', 'wb') as fp: pickle.dump(myData, fp) or [hundreds of lines of code and a specification for this format that I'm too lazy to write] ?
Thanks
So... not actually JSON, then, but your own format using JSON as a transport layer?
Sure you can! &gt;&gt;&gt; json.dumps(float('inf')) 'Infinity' &gt;&gt;&gt; json.dumps(float('nan')) 'NaN'
How much time did it take you?
If you work for a while in programming or sysadm, you will notice an important thing at work is googling and applying what you found to the problem you have.
I've already used it in a CG studio for different projects like stacking render files to psb/psd, mapping a folder structure to a Photoshop group/layer structure etc. In fact you can do almost anything in Photoshop programmatically and don't use the crappy JavaScript PS API.
&gt; it would redeem itself if it was human readable, but it isn't. How exactly is JSON "not human readable"? I see like 20 JSON snippets on this very page. I use YAML for personal projects because I find it a tiny bit more readable, but if YAML weren't (in practice) backwards compatible with JSON, I would never do that. &gt; The only reason it is popular is because it comes with JavaScript which is in every browser. No, it's popular because it hits the spot: it's a minimal language for representing dumb data that has the two types of containers you desperately need (lists and dictionaries), the usual scalar types and nothing else, and its serialization format is so dumb that anyone can understand it.
If you do the free course Automate the boring stuff with python, you will learn how to do it. https://automatetheboringstuff.com/
&gt; Why have we needed all of these different formats when there's one universal format already? Why did we need all these programming languages, when Cobol is Turing complete? Here's a specific example from a project I'm working on. I have a database of 16k+ audio samples which I'm computing statistics on. I initially stored the data as JSON/Yaml, but they were slooow to write and slooow to open and BIIIG. Now I store the data as .npy files. They're well over ten times smaller, but more, I can open them as memory mapped files. I now have a single file with all 280 gigs of my samples which I open in memory mapped mode and then treat it like it's a single huge array with size (70000000000, 2). You try doing that in JSON! And before you say, "Oh, this is a specialized example" - I've worked on real world projects with data files far bigger than this, stored as protocol buffers. Lots and lots of people these days are working with millions of pieces of data. Storing it in .json files is a bad way to go!
You should be able to do: git clone git@github.com:numpy/numpy.git cd numpy python setup.py install More details [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/user/building.html). But TBH - you should not be _using_ this - it's an alpha version, there are almost _guaranteed_ to be bugs - both reversions and brand-new bugs. If you want to help the community, you could _test_ it and report problems...
It would be great to have at least a minimal README file with instruction how to use the code.

&gt; The 2 to 3 move is not trivial, even for a single project, let alone a company that has been using 2.6/2.7 for years and building their infrastructure with it. Well - it isn't "trivial" but it isn't that hard either. In particular, it's something you can do a bit at a time - the `six` module lets you write code that works in both Python 2 and Python 3. Also, [2to3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/2to3.html) is extremely solid. I ported a fairly large program to Python 3 that used a lot of features like the serial port - I really encountered not one problem.
Lmao seriously. People are the worst.
I'm with you, I don't like these implicit bits of code being added. The second line of Zen of Python even says "Explicit is better than implicit." I'm also against walruses in my code, but that debate has been beaten to a pulp. &lt;/oldmanrant&gt;
So I couldn't find this question answered anywhere: why is it called the walrus operator? The only reason I saw was that's what they call it in Go, but that just passes the buck.
This really misses the point. Maybe you're strong enough not to be pulled down by one negative comment in your private life but hundreds or thousands over the course of years capitalizing on any small mistake starts to add up. It's a thousand tiny cuts. This comment is also wildly ignorant of recent attitudes towards mental health. Just being a public figure doesn't make you immune to feelings of self-doubt or questioning your own worth. Many people have been thrust into those positions unintentionally and struggle to deal with the criticisms large and small they may receive in their post. It's not always easy to push those invasive thoughts out like you suggest. Maybe instead of piling onto Guido with your disappointment, you could voice a more supportive opinion to drown out the Twitter crowd (since no one is ever negative on Reddit).
I am a bit curious on how you distributed the script to the customer. I suppose you needed some pip install etc to use it also. Did you creat a package with python install or freeze or something like that?
Go back one level on the repository. This is just a directory in a large repository. The root directory has instructions.
missed that. thanks.
I think you are not understanding what pickle is for. Pickle is *not* designed for things like sending requests over the network like json is. It is not designed for storing things long term in databases or files. In fact, all of those things would be security risks. It is really designed to be used to transmit ephermeral data between python processes. For example, the multiprocessing module uses pickle to transmit the code and data between processes. The celery worker queue library uses pickle to transmit complete tasks to workers. Some caching libraries use pickle to cache arbitrary python objects in some memory cache.
py2exe and PyInstaller are able to create executables with dependencies out of your scripts
Just finished chapter 11. It's so damn cool!
lol you are shit
I absolutely agree that it is, but how to go about replicating that privilege in a python script, that is what is challenging.
Well done! I agree.
I have never been on craigslist (I don't live in the US) so i checked it out to see if I could recommend it so my sibling could perhaps make a little money doing something like this. It looks like you have to pick an area but a gig like this would not rally be state dependant. Do people search the entire country for gigs somehow?
The construction of the list or the generator has nothing to do with the short-circuiting. All wouldn't short-circuit if it had to read the whole list before returning false. What you're saying that is a problem is that you have to create the list before sending in to all, but that is not all's fault, as it has not control of what you do outside of it.
Is video / images program a thing you can do, I'm part of NSFW story writing group we mix mp4 or gif with text to make erotica. PM me if you okay with things like this.
What do you mean youve got the code but need the structure? How are you currently talking to PhotoShop, via GUI events, IPC, win32 proc calls?
Sounds like something you could automate somehow ;)
I mean that I have functions doing things like create_layer_from_png or create_group_in_doc but I re-use them in different scripts. I use comtypes to talk with the native/exposed Photoshop API.
Generating the list takes a lot more time than iterating over it. I'd wager that if there's any kind of computation in the generator the list expression works on, short-circuiting in all is insignificant. That's the point of the tweet! I don't get why people get hung up on pointing out the irrelevant bits instead. Also, consider whether listifying this expression first is going to be insignificant, compared feeding it to all() def expr (): yield False while True: yield True
Use OpenCV for the recognition bit (this is a whole topic by itself) For the GUI, write it in PySimpleGUI (or PySimpleGuiQt) Compile to binary using PyInstaller though to be honest, if a nice GUI is your aim, I'd probably do this in C# / WPF / EmguCV
I respectfully decline; you have the right idea.
this makes it so much simpler. So all it is is a small "photobooth" app, that uploads data to a database.

This. If all you have is a hammer, every problem is a nail.
It’s more than just that, though. If a person with no programming knowledge googles this and finds a page like the pdfgrep page, they STILL will have no idea what to do. That entire page will be Greek to them. They won’t know how to run the program once downloaded, they won’t understand the command structure notation, and many people won’t even know how to get to the command line. It’s easy to forget how many basics we had to learn before we were able to make even a simple, slightly useful script. TLDR: Googling will not help the general public get a useful solution unless the Google search results include a GUI program with an install wizard.

You're seriously overestimating technical skillset. How would a small mom and pop shop know what Python is, or programming, or how to download Python, or where to run the code, or what the command line interface is, etc. Etc.
What system you are using, what errors you are seeing? You definitively will need to have compiler installed.

With... a loop? https://www.learnpython.org/en/Loops
Thanks. That fixed the syntax error. &amp;#x200B; Python lead me to believe the variable name fx, or what was stored by the variable, caused the syntax error. When Python responds with a syntax error, is it generally referring to the line above the location Python suggests as the syntax error?
You might want to take down that image, it includes the unredacted URL in the error message.
Yep, I used it once, that time it did not work, I tried with a sftp program. I am just curious if that is what OP did or not.
Going where mortal queries cannot pass. Designing rules for an algorithm that will parse several million rows in a Snowflake database and create new categorization and detail columns based on a chronically concatenated and inconsistent product name field. So totally stoked!
So their site is that bad you have to automate it yourself to search for a certain category over all the states?
Because it has no closing parenthesis it was considered as a continuation of the previous line.
I agree, that's not what I referring to. I'm referring to the fact that what you're complaining about has absolutely nothing to do with short circuiting. It only concerns creating an unnecessary list, which is done before the function in question is even called.

I left fark for reddit some years ago. Fark was just flat comments, truly crap in its own time, let alone when slashdot had nested comments pretty much from the start.
Removal of GIL will most likey require a breaking changes to the language. There were multiple attempts to remove it and each time it actually slowed the python down, because of how Python does things. Although if they would provide a compile option: - 100% compatible, but with GIL - broken compatibility, some obscure functionality not available or done differently, C interface massively changed, but without GIL I think everything would resolve itself and people would adapt their code to the second option.
Well craigslist wasn’t really meant for that. I’m not entirely sure if it’s against their TOS to respond to ads that aren’t in your area so there’s that. But craigslist only ever intended people to search their own area and maybe a couple neighboring areas. Nothing like site wide.
In the quoted article Guido specifically says what bothered him was core devs subtweeting him on Twitter rather than addressing him directly and honestly. That's quite different than what you are , frankly, just making up.
 &gt;&gt;&gt; "male" or "female" 'male' `or` and `and` always return one of their operands. If you wrote their behaviour as functions, they would work like this: def or_(a, b): if a: return a return b def and_(a, b): if not a: return a return b
I have read "Clean Architecture" by Robert C. Martin. But many OOP idoms he used are more or less hard to apply in python. But I know what you mean. I have the exact same problem. Maybe try searching for something like "Object Oriented Analyses and Design"? I am realy curious how a "real professional" get these things thought
This comment is an example of social media being incredibly toxic. I'm quite certain I know who you are referring to. The person in the video you are describing is quite widely loved and respected, and gives everyone respect and kindness in addition to being a good instructor and core dev.
Seriously? Look up photos of walruses and then look at the operator symbol while tilting your head 90 degrees to the left.
The original tweet: &gt;The any() and all() builtins have short-circuiting behavior, **but that is lost if you use a list comprehension**: I question my ability to read english (second language), as I'm entirely unable to see any ambiguity. The emphasis is mine.
Nice
It would have been lost if it didn't do it for lists, which it clearly does. Its benefits, however, are very small compared to the very expensive operation that was done right before calling it.
Alright, let's break this down. &gt; Sorting because non-concatenation axis is not aligned. This shows the problem. I don't use pandas myself, but I think what's happening is you do `df.append(data)` but the columns are different: in `df` it is `['Product', 'Year', 'Size','Storage','Price']`, in `data` it is `['Price', 'Storage', 'Product', 'Year', 'Size']`. So in order to not mess this up, pandas sorts the columns to make them match. So if you want to make it keep working in future versions of pandas and for now not get the warning, the following explains what you need to do: &gt; A future version of pandas will change to not sort by default. &gt;To accept the future behavior, pass 'sort=False'. &gt;To retain the current behavior and silence the warning, pass 'sort=True'. That is, change the second to last line to `df.append(data, sort=True)`.

There isn't an ambiguity, people are misconstruing what the tweet is about. You're correct in your interpretation. Raymond is not saying that the function is no longer short-circuiting, he is saying the entirety of the benefit of short circuiting can be lost if you use a list comprehension.
I hope more people will hear about it with this prize. It really deserves the "simple" title.
Wut
Yeeees? Isn't that what the whole point is. Doing a load of potentially computationally expensive work is so much more time consuming than iterating over a list, that the benefit of short-circuit is essentially lost.
You got downvoted hard LMAO
&gt; talk with the native/exposed Photoshop API. Do you have documentation on the Photoshop API? I'm curious about your project. Btw, I create Python Modules (SDKs) for REST APIs on a regular basis. I might be able to help you develop a Python Library for this.
congrats! well deserved prize! now awaiting more and more features! especially for web!
My boss was idly wondering about what it would take to get a grant to hire someone to write jython 3... sadly, the answer is likely "a lot".
No, it's not lost. It's still there. That's absolutely not the point. Like I said, if you didn't have to create the list just for all, you'd not have a performance penalty.
possibly, you have created a virtual environment. PyCharm defaults to this when creating a new project. You should choose "system interpreter" if Pygame is installed in the system interpreter.
For Craigslist it makes sense to have regions right, not all gigs are programming related. Having to write a script to scrape data from all regions for these specific kind of remote projects doesn't seem like an indication of a bad site.
I hate that section has gone to crap in Austin, used to find small businesses needing websites, simple upkeep, etc. Now it's just "work from home!" or "rewire whole building for $10 hour!"
All languages have some syntax constructs. You have to be really careful about adding syntax because once it's in, you can never take it out without a breaking change. The more syntax you have, the harder your language is to learn, read, and remember. Python prides itself on being very learnable; pseudocode-y enough that it's the tool to reach for for simple scripting needs. The more syntax you add, the further it gets from that. Furthermore, python prides itself on being very explicit and not surprising - you should err on the side of adding more lines where it's clear what you're doing, rather than shooting for one-liners without that same clarity. Look at rust, for example. It's a great language and I truly hope that people just stop writing C in favour of rust. However, there is *so much syntax*. It's really hard to keep track; I write rust only occasionally and every time it's a grind through the docs. Some believe that the benefit of the walrus operator is marginal (saves you one or two lines in fairly specific situations), but the cognitive and maintenance overhead of more syntax, for devs, learners, readers, and users, is not only not worth it, but strikes at the heart of what python *is*.
Yes, 0.1µs is probably still shaved off, which is a huge bonus when the 20 second full scan of the underlying database have to be recouped. At the time the list comprehension is finished executing, all of the heavy lifting have been done. The time to scan a list of scalars are so insignificant, compared to making it in the first place, that your argument becomes meaningless.
Agreed, I love this analogy!
Why the downvotes?
Read the original thread, the question asks why python dumps to a new pickle format instead of json like every other language. The original response suggested it was because json can't distinguish between such and such, as shown, this is false. The real answer is that python chose a binary format for pickle because of space efficiency.
I've just written a Wookiee Name &amp; Meaning Generator. [Give it a try](https://trinket.io/python3/6ab03eaf6f)
Lol @ json not being human readable, it's its main identity, it's what made it supremingly popular. It seems like this is an edgy layer 2 opinion.
WOOOOOOOO CONGRATS BUDDY!!! You kick but man! Great Job!
2. Guido isn't gone; He's just no longer BFDL. 2. Changing such a central part of the syntax would make all existing python programs invalid overnight.
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**.

Oscar Wilde was obviously never on Facebook
What's your GitHub? Or do you have a tutorial on SDK development for Python? love to learn how to start developing SDK's.
Hey, if you want to carry on doing this, may i suggest starting up a fiverr account, I did and it's how I started making a but of cash for small projects, some were kids uni projects and I found then relatively easy and enjoyable and got paid for it. I also tutor people on it as well. They take 20% which is a bit shit but otherwise I found it pretty good. Made roughly $250 for a couple projects that took a little less than a week over all. It was great for a young me in school
Can you send me one of your stories?
The problem is that I call it many times in a while true loop, so I thought any unnecessary thread (after the function returns) would free the memory, but it isn't so.
Sure, but that is not my point. I already said I agree with you there. This is not what this is about. In the tweet, lost implies that it doesn't short circuit at all. This is wrong. You yourself said this a few comments back: &gt; The list comprehension doesn't short circuit. And that's the point Raymond makes here. If you unfold the thread, his explanation is much better than mine. The list comprehension itself doesn't short circuit. Why would it? All and any still short circuits. The tweet is trying to make the wrong point. The point he wants to make and you are making, correctly, is that performing needless expensive operations is obviously not efficient. We're essentially discussing what the word "lost" means. To me, in the context of code, it means that it doesn't happen. To you, it's that it happens, but it pales in comparison of the obviously inefficient step. In my view, this means that the tweet is ambiguous. If not, he could have worded it a lot better: "all and any short-circuit, to take advantage of that, you shouldn't create unnecessary expensive lists". Aside that, if the list you want to call any or all already exists prior to the call, then calling all on the list is quite a bit more efficient than calling all on the generator, as the generator is the unnecessary object. However, this means that you aren't mapping objects to proprieties. This can be seen in this example: import timeit original = [True for i in range(100000)] original[5000] = False n = 1000 res = timeit.timeit("all(original)", number=n, globals={"original": original}) print(res) # 0.03649922600015998 res = timeit.timeit("all(o for o in original)", number=n, globals={"original": original}) print(res) # 0.19900168903404847
&gt; In the tweet, lost implies that it doesn't short circuit at all. No it doesn't. It takes a particular willfully obtuse way of reading english to read that.
Congrats!
looks like an art piece using some kind of perlin noise generation.
I don't think such a library exists, since there are only two reasonably usable C compilers out there, and neither exposes a stable API. You might want to just shell out to g++ or clang with `subprocess.Popen`.
win 10 64bit, i have visual studio installed. here is the pastebin when i do \`py -3.8 -m pip install numpy\` its a huge error log [https://pastebin.com/SsVsRY9K](https://pastebin.com/SsVsRY9K)
Fun! I didnt like my given name anyway
Well, obviously more than one person read it like I did. Just go ahead and ignore everything else I said there.
good luck!
&gt; Pip install just ain't that hard. From a sysadmin perspective, it is.
I've probably spent around 10 hours total trying to make an executable in the past, never figured it out, tried everything, still baffles me how it's somehow possible, yet I can't do it, ever.
Dang I really wanted there to be a lib for this. I came across an article on [writing a compiler](https://norasandler.com/2017/11/29/Write-a-Compiler.html). There are IDEs that have buttons that build C source files. I think it would be useful to have a script build the code for me. Sort of like how Nodemon runs a JS file continuously and watches the file for changes, I want a single command to persistently compile a file or set of class files
Every social media and news aggregator site is a watered down version of itself. Reddit is in full eternal September mode.
So you want something that's going to monitor your files for changes and rebuild them? Or do you just want a build system?
nice work. may I ask what you created the website with? I really like the styling/layout and am currently trying to get ideas for a website I am designing. Cheers!
Monitor and build. I understand that as soon as I type into the file, it will spit out a ton of errors but as soon as I place that last semicolon or bracket, it should give me an executable
&gt; tongue and cheek Should be "tongue in cheek", FYI.
No, I’ve just use teamviewer and setup all stuff on client machine using Pipenv
Then you can use something like [reflex](https://github.com/cespare/reflex) with a build system like Make or Ninja - they have example in the README file just for that.
Sure, you can represent anything as a string as long as you're willing to write a parser for it.
About 8 hours
There was some controversy when this was added. Eventually, a sense of humour prevailed.
Check out Google Colab.
That looks like it is for me. Thank you for your patience and help. Gonna see if I cant get this working. It looks like it just takes a file to watch and a command to run as arguments
I did but no lead from there yet
Fairly paid then, imho
Yes, that's exactly what it does. If you use CMake and Ninja as your build system, it will be really fast, too.
Excellent thanks. Yea I saw it was done in Golang. Never messed with Go but I hear its quick
I think some of it comes down to "I don't want to use it!", much less comes down to "we shouldn't have to maintain something people don't use", and some of it is just hivemind "well other people don't like it so I don't either!". There was a [good talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uAvHOKofws) at PyCon that goes through some of this (like how it did not take very long at all to implement so it's not some monster to have to maintain). Personally, I think it's a fine shortcut to use in very specific cases that I think I've come across maybe... once or twice in ten years of coding with Python. I personally don't have a need or want to use it, but having it available has no bearing on whether I will continue to use Python or not. I thus found his advice towards the end of the talk to be pretty relevant: If you don't like it... don't use it!
Do you remember what the controversy was about? I can remember there was some sort of keruffle on python-dev over it, but I've long forgotten exactly how it played out.
Processing in Python source code on [github](https://github.com/aaronpenne/generative_art/blob/master/README.md)
Great book
He actually said, if i remember correctly (I kinda listened with one year to the original interview) that he didn’t like how other devs would refer to social media instead of telling things to his face. The internet can be a very negative place, I don’t think that’s a new development; and Guido has been around long enough to know how much stop-energy it generates (thanks to trolls like me, undoubtedly). I find it more credible that he was disappointed with other core-devs chickening out of a frank debate by shielding behind social outrage; and his “stepping down but hanging around” in the end was a way to get other core-devs to take responsibility for their own actions.
This right here. Sure they are googleing their problem, but how are they going to identify the solution?
The detecting file changes part will be fast in any language - it's the rebuilding code part that you should worry about, and Ninja will help a lot here compared to something like Make.

I've got a tip for you then, I had my best results when I would actively search through the requests section and sent them my offers, dont worry if they have already had requests as I found that they still accepted my offer most times.
What effect does it have (apart from not using a venv)?
It has requests section? facepalm.jpg
That’s not how memory works. Python does not free memory to the system until the process exists. Presumably it’s going to go back up. That’s an OS thing by the way. That’s different than the memory being garbage collected and reused internally. Close the object and run the python garbage collector module a few times if you need to.
The [animation of it being made](https://www.instagram.com/aaron_penne/p/BxMEJLyB8vf/) can explain better than me. Basically a circlish blob is drawn with edges perturbed by Perlin noise. Each frame it is moved down a bit, leaving a trail.
thank you
I prefer pip. Packages are often conservative with their requirements or the requirement is set based on an uncommon feature.
I suggest you to convert the Excel file in .CSV and use the pandas module

Looks like you're passing in a string to your second random.choice function (x=random.choice('b') != x=random.choice(b)). You might want to look into creating a dictionary that maps your string to an actual array variable. Good Luck!

https://github.com/aaronpenne/generative_art/blob/master/README.md This particular piece was a sketch so I didn't add it to the large messy readme.
I dont know if that's the name but imo it's not very intuitive and obvious. But you can see all requests from people that may be related to your gigs, then you can speak with them and ask them for more info or you can send them an offer
Ahahaha. Did you know that the programming language was actually named after the comedy troupe? And the default IDE after Eric.
None. It just tells poetry to install packages in the system python environment. 2hich is fine for docker images
Ninja, CMake and Reflex are exactly what I had in mind. I dont think any small project I have in the works warrants this tool set but I can definitely see how this setup can be beneficial for my goals. Thanks again
&gt; I'm just going to do this. &gt; -- Guido
Only because Guido wanted it. I fear that with the new democratic leadership, boringness will prevail.
IMO: vim Generally: Pycharm probably. Or VScode, or sublime text.

Unfortunate for you, but a lot of people really like it. I have wished for this - though I didn't know what I was wishing for - for a decade. if (foo := get(d, 'foo')): # Use foo elif (bar := get(d, 'bar')): # Use bar Interesting, I discovered during that time this C++ idiom: if (auto foo = bar()) { // Variable foo only exists in this scope }
Guido _supported_ this feature.
".It's okay if Python occasionally shows its lighter side in unexpected places. Think of the delight of future (junior) high schoolers who discover that Python participates in the tau debate. :-) " This is the most wholesome thing I've read this week.
This is awesome! Great work
Ty mate
They paid $100 and got a problem solved that's dirt cheap for programming work. If you explain this problem to a competent salaried technical person and they google it (probably find multiple potential ways to do it), choose a promising path, write the wrapper code, then explain how to install dependencies, answer questions, use the code in the environment it's needed in (run by non-technical person), it probably takes at least 2 billable hours. 2 hours of a technical person earning $100k/year is about $100. ($100k for 40 hr workweek at 50 wks/year is $50/hr for 2000hrs/year).
Not tried Vim. Pycharm and VSCode are good, with my preference being Pycharm. I understand that VSCode is improving at a rapid pace though.
It is because you have only one or two variables to inspect for debugging. But if you had like 6 or 7 different variables then it becomes a necessity to write properly.
Thanks for the reply
Does the example code from the first chapter "Depth First and Breath First Search" work for anyone?
There are several examples of using [PySimpleGUI](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org) with OpenCv. One of them is a [YOLO Demonstration](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/tree/master/YoloObjectDetection). Others can be found in the GitHub Demo Programs folders.
if you have no familiarity with Vim or Emacs, I would suggest Visual Studio Code. Microsoft heavily invests to it, adds new and useful features with every release and it has good documentation. If you prefer a full IDE, choose PyCharm.
This would be pretty cool!
TBH I agree with Raymond.
Great for an album cover.
Thanks again for adding this! A few questions... * How can I unstack the area charts? * I'm getting some weird effects when animating. Specifically, it looks like the filled area underneath is sort of flying across the screen from left to right to fill in under the chart. Based on the rate of animation, this is causing it to look like the filled area is doing some sort of weird wave motion. Is there a setting I can change that would cause it to just fill in underneath, like the graph at the bottom of [this page](https://plot.ly/python/filled-area-animation/)? * Let's say I create an animated chart with px and want to include it as part of a blog post - what's the easiest way to go about that?

I use it on a government computer. There are rules about using personal licenses on government issued equipment (in general, I just can't...even though I'm happy to pay for some stuff.)

Luckily we migrated away from ndb only a few weeks into the project, or we'd be stuck with Python 2 now.
Someone should have a coding competition with a budget like this!
I didn't understand! What voice in the docs?

This is exactly it. Some of the most insightful (in my opinion) Python developers like Nick Coghlan explained very clearly the problems with assignment expressions [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/python-ideas/uMb1ekFqa7c%5B1-25%5D) for example.
No, it wouldn't invalidate them. I believe colons to start indented blocks should be optional in the same way that semicolons at the end of a statement are optional. Code that includes them will still run, but the parser will stop complaining about syntactically unambiguous code that simply omits unnecessary characters.

Seems like he finally chose the professional approach to apologize for the intransparency regarding the fundraiser instead of trying to smear for uncovering it. Now, if he would also apologize to njs for those attempts to smear him, that would give me confidence that this might be a lasting change in attitude rather than just temporary damage control.
It's human readable only if you format it that way. Which is to say, it's readable with the right editor, but if it's one-line'd it becomes much less readable. Still miles better than xml... Imo yaml is the prettiest format, but json is such a standard (and also a subset of yaml, now) that either format works fine for most applications.

Readibilty certainly depends on the content, but it also depends to some extent on the syntax, it is to this extent that JSON is considered readable. Yaml was influenced by JSON greatly, so if you like YAML you must appreciate JSON's contribution. In the same vein, if you like JSON, you must appreciate XML's contribution. In an unrelated manner I wasn't aware that Yaml was a superset of JSON, that's a nice feature, although I wouldn't necessarily consider it better. Ease of learning and complexity of common usage are both huge factors that will be negatively affected by an increased complexity.

&gt; I blame the media for reporting on every twitter scandal as if it matters. We live in the era of continual outrage. When everything is beyond the pale, nothing is. However, the media will push stories that keep people glued to the channel. It started with "Are your kids about to drop into a vat of boiling acid? Tune in at 6 to find out!", to the last 5-10 years of the political channels. We see it nearly every year with the Oscars, too much of this, that or the other thing. Nobody gives a rip about the Oscars anymore, we have a saturation of media to watch, and don't need an official body telling us what the "best" movie is. We also fail to vet the stories, of all sorts. I could say that Guido diddled me as a child (nevermind he was on the wrong continent at the time). A few retweets, it gets pushed, then goes trending/viral. A nice character assassination, no money exchanged, and he'd have the permanent suspicion, even after reasonable people determine I lied. People just need to go for a walk outside more often. I know people who get worked up about things like politics, and the first time I heard one say "...and I tweeted how wrong X was!", I had to stifle laughter. But there you go, we live in a world where that's "action". I think automation is going to do some funny things in segregating our society into the producers and consumers. Consumers will keep busy with twitter and the like. I doubt Jeff Bezos is getting into flamewars on youtube comments. Busy people just don't have time for the garbage fires.

Heh, that's good! Some advice: 1. Paste your code as text instead of a screenshot, so it is more readable. 2. Avoid that net of conditionals by storing a dictionary with each move and their comparison, moves = {"paper" : {"win" : "rock", "lose" : "scissors"}, ...} print (moves["paper"]["win"]) ...you get the idea, so you can say `if (moves[user]["win"] == computer_move) ...` 3. In this case, you can save typing when managing the input from the user with `user_input.startswith("s")...` instead of comparing the initial and the whole word.

Appending a dataframe in Pandas is known to be a slow operation because of the underlying numpy data structure.

Professional mathematicians are often conservative to the point of pain. Here's a quote from [one professional mathematician](http://drrajivdesaimd.com/2010/01/25/mathematics-of-pi-3/) illustrating the mindset: "I will hang around with Pi even if it makes mathematics difficult." On the other hand, [here's another pi-skeptic mathematician](https://blog.wolfram.com/2015/06/28/2-pi-or-not-2-pi/) who actually did some *science* on the question of whether pi or tau would be better: The conclusions: - the benefit of using π versus τ depends strongly on the complexity of the equation and the field you are in; - there's marginal benefit from changing from π to τ given that we're already in a pi-world, but on the basis of "majority wins", there's a minor case for switching; - if we started in a tau-world, and asked whether it makes sense to replace τ/2 with π, the answer would be *strongly* No; - and there's a *very* strong benefit from replacing 2π*i* with τ. Of course the power of tradition in mathematics is enormous. The only thing stronger than tradition is the habit of mathematicians to invent their own notation and definitions which clash with those of other mathematicians' notation. (E.g. there are mutually contradictory definitions of `sinc` in use, both τ and φ are used for the golden ratio, geometers and topologists can't agree on what a hypersphere is, I count at least four notations in common use for differentiation, and statisticians use by my count *at least* a dozen different ways to calculate sample quantiles.)

Have you considered using a graphical interface (e.g, Tkinter)? It’s very good for this stuff! Oh, and good job. Keep going!
You may be interested in [https://www.pygame.org/](https://www.pygame.org/) It has some limitations, but can be used to make complex games - also there are loads of open source games you can pull apart to see how they work. Also, there is pygame zero - [https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/](https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) \- designed to be easier to get started with as a learning platform (though, I am not familiar with it)
This really helped me to get an overview of the packages out there. Thanks a lot!
I am used to them now but they really aren't necessary -- everything else is done with semicolons and whitespace, and if/def etc could be too. Maybe this thread was the wrong time to bring it up or something?
I will post a comment for the code.. I sort of get what you mean in your second point but have no idea how to put it into practice. And, for the third point, say a person typed in shrhfj randomly, wouldn't that activate it? Great advise though thanks.
Thanks. Going to learn js soon
Tried to download tkintwr but didn't really see how so I just did it in notepad lol
Heard of pygame before. I'll check it out

Make sure you spell it right!") rps() import random computer = random.randint(1,3) if computer == 1: string_computer = "Rock" elif computer == 2: string_computer = "Paper" elif computer == 3: string_computer = "Scissors" else: print ("There must had been a glitch") rps() if answer == computer: print(("The computer chose"), string_computer,("so it\'s a draw!")) rps() elif answer == 1 and computer == 2: print(("The computer chose"), string_computer,("so unfortunately you lost.")) rps() elif answer == 1 and computer == 3: print(("The computer chose"), string_computer,("so you won! Congratulations!")) rps() elif answer == 2 and computer == 1: print(("The computer chose"), string_computer,("so you won!

I think the python interpreter has tkinter automatically installed, but if not use pip. I think you do python -m pip install tkinter in a command window

Ok, cool, thanks for the info.
Since lots of gigs these days can be something other than shipping items etc, I think it is.
You should already have it installed with python. Create a new .py file and write: import tkinter root = tkinter.Tk() w = Label(root, text="Hello, world!") w.pack() root.mainloop() Assuming you are using Python 3 ... Python 2 has tkinter but I believe it has a capital "t" so instead you would use; "`import Tkinter`" and "`root =` [`Tkinter.Tk`](https://Tkinter.Tk)`()`" I recommend Kivy over Tkinter but Kivy is a little harder to understand, you have to install it and it's not as simple as just a "python -m pip install", not only that but it's got this whole .kv system you have to learn and it's just a pain in the ass. Once you learn it though; it has a lot of tools for developing good looking applications quickly.
I'm still learning as well. I have a question: Is it actually good practice to call the function rps() within the function itself to restart it? Is it being aborted and restarted this way? Coming from Pascal it feels like recursion?
Released new web features today :-)
Looks pretty nice, good job with the error handling! Here are some small tips: *** For the computer string you can use an array: move_names = ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"] string_computer = move_names[computer - 1] Notice how we must subtract 1 from the computer move because arrays start at 0. *** When comparing a variable against multiple inputs, you can use the "in" operator: if answer in ("rock", "r"): *** You can use a little mathematic trick to calculate the winner. Notice that in your code the winner "move code" is always 1 greater than the loser: paper (2) wins rock (1), scissors (3) wins paper (2). The only exception is that rock (1) wins scissors (3), where the difference is -2. To solve that you could add 3 to the difference if the code is negative, which will give you the result of 1. (This is the same as doing code_diff % 3, if you are familiar with the modulus operation). So you could do: code_diff = answer - computer if code_diff &lt; 0: code_diff += 3 if code_diff == 0: tie elif code_diff == 1: human won elif code_diff == 2: computer won *** The logic to calculate the winner could be extracted into a new function: # returns 0: tie, 1: human, 2: computer def winner(human, computer): return (human - computer) % 3 Even though in this case the function is just one line, the main code will be way more clear this way. *** And finally, a few questions for the more experienced python programmers: Would you use an enum to represent possible moves in this code? I certainly would when programming in C or Rust, but I have never used enums in Python so I don't know if it is idiomatic. And second question, the rps function in the OP will eventually hit the recursion limit and crash, right?
It took 3 years and 46 employees worked on the project at one point or another (clearly not the whole time, I was looking at the acknowledgments) and they even hired the creator of Python!?! I understand why some companies don't want to switch from Python 2.
Instead of having the output as a string, I'd do the output as a list moves = {"rock": {"win": ["scissors"], "lose": ["paper", "dynamite"], "draw": ["rock"], "etc": ... if computer_move in moves[user]["win"]: ... That way you could add expanded answers for your cheesy rock paper scissors everything game.
Nop, not a good practice. The stack will keep growing.

I'm looking for something more in the line of How to plan the production of the code so that the process goes smoothly. For example, I don't want to rewrite parts or a whole section of it every time I want to add new functions or features because I just realized I could've done something a better way.
Dude, that is so cool. I started programming when I was 14. My advice to you is to keep it up, and also stay focused on your schoolwork! Employers don't care if you can code if you don't have at least a Bachelor's!
&gt; he boring serious answer is that it violates "more than one obvious way to do things" principle in service of a quixotic notation that is never - never - used in actual professional mathematics. Yes, because nothing else in Python has multiple ways of doing something.... Not to mention, Python as a language has no control over how you write your equations, and there are always infinite ways to write those, depending on how crazy you are. Adding tau to the language didn't suddenly create a new way to do anything
