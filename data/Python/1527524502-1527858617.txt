This is really cool ! 
Nice work man this is actually soo cool
There isn't even python scripting for minecraft on PC, the game uses Java.
I wasn't aware of numba. This is wonderful! I'll be playing around with it soon. Thank you! My goal with this post was to go from the paper to a naive implementation of the algorithm. Optimization is definitely important though, and I've yet to look into it for seam carving.
I printed a PDF which is the book "The Coder's Apprentice". I bought "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python", and bought an online course on Udemy.
You want to post the error trace you're getting?
These are neat and all, but I always find that the examples used are so perfect that there's nothing that I really learn. It's like perfect cable management where you can follow the perfectly labeled ethernet from the switch to the patch panel to the machine. Where's the guy who put a hole in the wall with a sledgehammer and ran a snake of 50 unlabeled cables along the floorboards? For example, in one of the projects I'm working on now, the tables have no classes and the items within the tables are just text without any tags. I looked through these types of examples for hours with examples of perfect datasets until I actually found an example which worked, which in the end turned out to be the sledgehammer and cable ties equivalent: item1 = allrecords[number].next_sibling.text item2 = allrecords[number].next_sibling.next_sibling.text item3 = allrecords[number].next_sibling.next_sibling.next_sibling.text item4 = allrecords[number].next_sibling.next_sibling.next_sibling.next_sibling.text
For new grads, more useful than a certificate is a project that you've worked on where you can talk about the problems you encountered, how you might address them if you had more time, and what you would do differently now that you have that experience. There's some information on ideas for projects over at r/learnpython's wiki. You may also want to check out r/csmajors and r/cscareerquestions, there are thousands of posts from people in a similar situation trying to figure out what to do.
BeautifulSoup 4 (bs4) was last updated in May 2017 https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/#history ...it's not recent, but it's not *years*.
I chose my words carefully, i.e. "significant". Last I checked the last update was 2016, a couple updates went out last year but I stand by my previous statement. It doesn't get much love anymore.
General Rule of Thumb - Flask for one pagers and quick and dirty set ups - Django for really anything longer
lxml 
I used it for years, it was good for learning how to build a scraper but when you scale up to millions of pages it’s performance issues start to show fast.
I was working on this project: [YoutubeSoundTool](https://github.com/Annihilator708/YoutubeSoundTool) You are able to download .mp3 from youtube. It appears in a download folder created by the program itself. Yesterday I finished the GUI so I'm ready to expand. Any ideas that would fit?
Hadn’t considered that. Maybe worth a second shot.
Very nice video, concise, to the point and all relevant information. I enjoyed it a lot and will save it for future reference.
After last week's project management fiasco my main takeaway was poetry is the best. I'm looking forward to start rolling new projects with the `poetry` flow.
Nothing, except when you run into performance problems. Then you start to think about the benefits of optimising your python code or just writing the scraper in Go or C++.
Thanks for this! Seems like a great tool.
a static site generator for my soon to be blog, using asyncio and markdown parsing library.
very neat. thanks!
We solved our performance problems with switching to lxml and leveraging asycio and message queues to run more concurrent requests. I haven’t written C++ in a very long time but I imagine it’s no small task.
Can't you just get the parent element (tr I guess?), get a list of all the children and slice it appropriately? Using lxml that would be along the lines of (item1, item2, item3, item4) = (it.text for it in allrecords[number][:4]) or something along those lines (assuming allrecords is the table rows)
I was planning to do something similar to export my current music in .mp3 files to spotify, but it seems that spotify don't even have half of my songs..
How long did you take to do this? 
I'll give that a shot and report back!
Really awesome idea and implementation! 
created a [pull request](https://github.com/mileshenrichs/spotify-playlist-generator/pull/1) for example script.db file 
I'm doing something similar using acoustic data and neural networks. I read the first minute of the song. Perform a FFT and use certain frequencies as the input for the network. It works pretty well. But it also took a year categorizing enough training data.
Yummy, I think I see the kind of site that is. The color shading specifies whether it's a "title" row or an actual "data" row or some shit like that?
Oh no, they decided to be fancy and have the bootstrap style row shading, so it's the same data in alternating bgcolors. Allrecords is a combination of whiterecords and bluerecords. Hah. Now, I'll be honest and say I'm pretty basic when it comes to this stuff, so I'm sure there are better ways to handle it, like your example above. But for the moment the crude way is working.
No, this is just more SPAM from u/babyfase -- this user's spamming is prolific and not even that well done. Avoid.
 length_names = 0 for friend in friends_list: length_names += len(friend) print(length_names) This way, the for loop goes through each element in the array, gets the length of that element, and adds it to length_names
It's replaced pyflakes for me.
 friends_list = ['Phillip', 'Jamie', 'Eric', 'Gilbert', 'John'] sum = 0 for friend in friends_list: sum += len(friend) avg = sum / len(friends_list) Let us know if anything isn't clear with that solution.
Anyone know how to get this scrape a Google Music playlist and turn it into a Spotify playlist? I would love to keep my Spotify playlist updated 
Thanks! This was in the chapter but I did not understand this section enough to use it in this situation.
code mixed up, please use something like pastebin suggest : use canvas
It's cool that you were able to automate something like this. I would never have thought to try automating my music browsing, since it revolves around taste, but it does take a bunch of time now that you mention it.
Yeah, it is typically very difficult to usefully automate something revolving around taste without some type of machine learning. This worked pretty well for me just because I noticed I was doing the same thing every week (looking over the top songs, checking if they were on spotify, giving them each a test listen). If you can find some sort of repetition at any stage in the process, that's a fantastic opportunity for automation.

Explaining the overall general idea and how it works in the README.md is really cool. Thanks for sharing this!
Not related to Python programming: but you could use IFTTT to create this easily. Use one of the "New post..." triggers in the [Reddit](https://ifttt.com/reddit) channel and the Spotify "Add track to a playlist" [Spotify](https://ifttt.com/spotify) trigger. With that said, you should definitely try to program your own solution in Python. It would be great practice and you could build a customized process.
The hell are you on about? 
Hey, this is a fab little python script, especially if you are new to python as you say! There are a couple of things worth taking a look at for your next python project that will help when you start to work with a larger codebase. Nothing outright wrong but a couple of best practices that'll help you in the long run: 1) You don't need to define everything as a function as in Java: your authHeader can just be a top level dictionary and everything will work just fine. This way, you have a single piece of data that you reuse rather than creating /GCing copies on every call. 2) Python lists have a _lot_ of built in functionality: if you want to check if something is in the list just use `if ITEM in LIST` rather than coding up a search algorithm in python. The core devs put a lot of work into making sure that this is fast and efficient (plus it runs at the C level rather than interpreted python bytecode). 3) You are relying on global state a lot: it's not until the bottom of the script that you create your database cursor that you use implicitly everywhere else. While this _does_ work, it will get you into trouble fairly quickly with larger code bases. As a general rule, if you use something in a function, pass it in or create it inside the body of the function. It makes your code easier to reason about and it helps keep each function contained as a single piece of business logic. (It also makes testing a _lot_ easier!) 4) You've done a really good job of documenting the purpose of your functions in nice clear comments. If you make the top level comments docstrings then you (or a user of your code) will be able to use python's built `help` function to inspect them in the repl. Keep up the good work!
I need to be critical because I love both Python and the Hip\-hop **culture.** The idea is great but there are some buts. First of all, you are not applying PEP8. It's not mandatory but it's good to do at least the naming rules e.g. snake case. There are a lot of magic values, for example in the function where you normalize the names, to name one. Don't reinvent the wheel \(binary search, really?\). Consider using the \_\_name\_\_ == "\_\_main\_\_" pattern for the script part. It's good that you separated you code in multiple function but they seem to do a lot of things and isn't clear what exactly they do. Second, Hip\-hop is the name of a whole culture of five elements: Bboying, MCing \(rap\), Graffiti and DJing \(turntablism\). We're talking about only rap here. I can talk about this topic much more than about Python. :D I don't mean to offend you in any way.
I want to find tweets that are talking about those news in real time, so its streaming API. I have it working but im limited to 1 track at a time, i cant track multiple instances at the same time. For the 2nd question: track is a list/string with this format ["something"], when i remove the stop words etc from the title i get something like ["Trump abortion"], since each word isnt separated by "" like ["Trump", "abortion"] the results from the stream are weird and most of them are about other topics.
I'm not offended at all, thanks for the constructive comment. I've never heard of PEP8, I'll have to look into that. As far as hip hop goes, I absolutely agree that the music I'm referring to isn't truly "hip hop." I just used the term because it's a programming-oriented subreddit and I didn't want to get too in-depth on the music side of things.
Whether a demand can fairly be considered "oppressive" or not friends an awful lot on what exactly the demand is. "Censor your opinions about topics relevant to the subreddit" - yes, would clearly be oppressive. "Don't be mean and bigoted while we try to begin repairing the tremendous damage we've already done by scaring away vast swathes all the regular, emotional &amp; vulnerable human beings" - is not oppressive in the slightest. In fact it's the opposite. It's instituting a reasonable rule of law in a place that was formerly a wild west, allowing only the most insensitive to win and take over the space. 
Wow, thanks for the notes, these are super helpful! I decided to use binary search because I knew it'd be searching through the same list many times, and I assumed `if ITEM in LIST` just performed a linear search, but I must have been mistaken. I do rely on global state a lot... I wasn't too concerned about it since it's a pretty small script, but I understand in a larger project it'd make much more sense to pass it to each function.
Yes reddit has a python api wrapper called PRAW (python reddit api wrapper) that can do the scraping through comments/posts, then feed the songs into this script to be added to spotify
This is really cool! I'm looking to do some side projects this summer and will probably do them in Python. If you'd be interested in collaborating on something and have another cool idea like this hmu.
Care to share the Project?
Challenge yourself by creating games in the terminal. With all couple of tricks `curses` lets you do some really cool stuff. That's what I did to help myself get more comfortable with Python. Let me know if you want to see some source code.
I'm not trying to belittle their efforts. I'm offering "because it's already available with Python" as a reasonable answer to your question. They don't appear to be doing anything that needs to look native so it works for them.
len(‘’.join(friends_list))
I can tell youre a Java guy from your naming conventions.
Hi! Many thanks for the feedback! 😊 I will add the fix ASAP 🚀 
These will be the next features! Thanks for your feedback 😊
I've seen this three times now. What the fuck is `me`?
Just a small comment: on [line 99](https://github.com/mileshenrichs/spotify-playlist-generator/blob/392add1e39b3c66c4698ed621582e88a82e16bf0/generate.py#L99) you could use the date string format '&amp;#37;\-m/&amp;#37;d' which will not give you a zero\-padded month number, meaning you won't have to handle any zeros in the lines that follow.
pyside2 doesn't have these licensing issues...
Ah, good to know. I was expecting there to be a format that gave me a non-padded month number, for some reason I guess I skipped over that when I was looking
This is an example of where functional programming techniques can make life a lot easier and more concise. This comment may introduce some ideas you've not yet heard of, but you will encounter them sooner or later as you learn Python. So let's start with your list of friends: &gt;&gt;&gt; friends = ['Phillip', 'Jamie', 'Eric', 'Gilbert', 'John'] You're already familiar with the idea of applying a function to an object to get a new value, such as applying the *len* function to lists or strings: &gt;&gt;&gt; len(friends) 5 &gt;&gt;&gt; len(friends[0]) 7 The *map* function allows you to apply a function automatically to each of a list of things, producing a list of the results: &gt;&gt;&gt; map(len, friends) &lt;map at 0x7f0b4a4d1b38&gt; Oops! That's not quite a list of results yet, for good reasons we won't get into here, but when you see something that's supposed to be producing a list-like thing or not, you can usually just pass it to the *list* function to turn it into a list: &gt;&gt;&gt; list(map(len, friends)) [7, 5, 4, 7, 4] There are also functions that take a list and combine the elements to produce a single result. The general version of this is *reduce*, which works a little bit like *map*, but let's let you look that up later and just use the simple variant of it that sums a list: &gt;&gt;&gt; sum(map(len, friends)) 27 And that's how easy adding the lengths of a list of items is! The average name length is also trivial to calculate using the same techniques: &gt;&gt;&gt; sum(map(len, friends)) / len(friends) 5.4 While we're working with strings and numbers here, these techniques can be extended to considerably more sophisticated data types, too. In languages like Haskell we don't even have `for` or `while` loops; we use functions like *map* all the time. 
How does one go about creating something like this? I’m a beginner trying to learn but can’t fathom how you make this from scratch...
Wow poetry seems to be taking huge leaps with each release. I'll have to use it for my next project, it looks too good.
Absolutely, steal whatever you need lol
It's a joke about "no step on sneak" Or at least I think so.
Nice script! In addition to the good suggestions from /u/sminez, here are a couple more: Your calls to the sqlite library are scattered throughout your code. You could encapsulate all of the database code within a class which would clean up your other functions a bit and would allow you to more easily change the DB code in the future if you wanted to. Something like this: class SpotifyDB: def __init__(self): self.conn = sqlite3.connect('script.db') def getSpotifyToken(self): c = self.conn.cursor() c.execute("SELECT value FROM tokens WHERE token_type = 'access_token'") return c.fetchone()[0] def insertPlaylist(self, newPlaylistId, playlistName): c = self.conn.cursor() c.execute("INSERT INTO playlists_created (spotify_playlist_id, playlist_name) VALUES (?, ?)", (newPlaylistId, playlistName)) self.conn.commit() ... Then you can create an object from this class like this: db = SpotifyDB() And then the rest of your code can use this object: spotifyToken = db.getSpotifyToken() and: db.insertPlaylist(newPlaylistId, playlistName) It is also considered best practice to put all of your code into functions. This way the Python file can be executed as a script, or imported by other code which can use its functions (for example, if you want to write a test suite that tests your functions). This is the common pattern: def main(): # put the code under BEGIN SCRIPT here # this will call main(), but only if this file is being executed as a script if __name__ == '__main__': main() It looks like you are off to a great start, have fun continuing your Python journey!
the fuse fs should behave the same way your regular disk does. if it doesn't it's an issue with the fuse fs. some fuse fs might have limitations (usually documented) like not implementing write access.
`echo 0‘ will also write a newline character. Try `f.write('0\n')`
The actual code itself isn't super complicated. It does, however, combine multiple concepts that are used frequently in application programming as a whole. These concepts are: HTTP requests, SQLite databases, web authentication, and use of public APIs \(application programming interfaces\). To emulate something like this, I think it'd be easiest to address each concept, one at a time. Step one would be the very basics of Python: variables, lists, functions. Once you have a decent grasp on how these data structures function in a Python project, you can begin to address broader concepts I listed. None of those concepts are specific to Python, so watching conceptual overviews on Youtube might be helpful. I'd recommend starting with the task of building a basic understanding of HTTP. In my script, I use HTTP requests to get information from the website with the top 100 songs list, as well as to send and retrieve information to Spotify. HTTP requests tie in pretty closely to API use. The next concept, web authentication, is fairly complicated and not something you need to deal with straight\-on. Web authentication is, however, the process used to make sure that my Spotify account is safe and only my app can make changes to it, with my explicit permission. Finally, databases. I didn't necessarily **need** to use a database in this script, but it came in handy to easily retrieve my authentication keys, as well as to keep track of which songs I've already added to a playlist. Here are some resources \(some of which I've used\) to take a look at for each concept. Keep in mind, it took me months to learn all these, so don't feel like you're expected to know how to implement these immediately: HTTP: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzSXHv8RKdM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzSXHv8RKdM) APIs: [https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/35939/how\-do\-web\-apis\-work](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/35939/how-do-web-apis-work) Web Authentication \(Spotify\-specific\): [https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization\-guide/](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/) SQLite Database: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o\-vsdfCBpsU&amp;list=PLQVvvaa0QuDezJh0sC5CqXLKZTSKU1YNo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-vsdfCBpsU&amp;list=PLQVvvaa0QuDezJh0sC5CqXLKZTSKU1YNo) Hope these help. Make sure you nail down the basics of Python first, before trying to deal with these more complicated programming concepts.
Given the GIL (often) it could be "no thread on snek"
Encapsulating all the database interaction into a class is a great idea. Thanks for providing example code, that makes the implementation very clear. I appreciate the advice!
I wanted to try beeware and toga, tried install beeware with poetry (poetry add beeware didn't work) but it couldn't handle dependencies, and how to create new beeware project with poetry? (poetry run beeware new?) Any help would be appreciated.
After the title and intro, the article keeps referring to Flask as "Flash", which is both confusing and libelous ;)
What do you mean? You can teach me or not? 
Lektic.py
Right, the "don't tread on me" Gadsden flag. I'm pointing out that `me` ain't a python thing
I just checked I there is definitely a bug when retrieving the beeware's dependencies. I see where this is coming from and the fix should be trivial. I will commit the fix and push a new bugfix release.
&gt;you can only have 1 twitter connection per APP so i cant make a listener for each news. How can i search multiple news with only 1 listener? Track multiple keywords (comma separate them) with a single filter and then keyword search the tweets in the listener to figure out whats what.
If you feel like answering - I'm trying to leave before I get pigeonholed in my current job. What would you recommend a person learn about that is the common ground across python centric jobs? Sorry if the question is too broad

Let's be honest, the wild majority of GUI programming as it is is awful. Having tried GTK, Qt, wxWidgets, libgui, etc. The only GUI that hasn't been awful in my experience has been React-y GUI and Elm/Relm GUI. 
Thanks for this, I'll save this comment for future reference. I have Just finished all the course work for an intro to programming post-grad class. Once I've done my exam I will have a look at getting some projects on the go to help solidify my understanding of python. Maybe something with sports statistics or the like
I love Markdown for its simplicity and I love LaTeX for it's appearance and flexibility (even though it often takes a lot of work to realize it). Projects like these seems like a good way to try to merge the two, but I really worry about a new [standards issue](https://xkcd.com/927/)
The [NTLK](https://www.nltk.org/) may be worth a look!
Good job on the dependency resolver. It looks really, really good.
To be honest, they all pissed me off a lot except hugo, which only pissed me off a little bit.
Interesting group and environment to work in. Has your group considered producing fat binaries which bundle python to the end users rather than relying on system python to be installed? Latest 3.6 would be a fine choice. Assuming it is not too much work to update existing code for compatibility. Look into creating fat binaries / Python executables as mentioned above. Do encourage having a tested codebase and standard release process like any other project, despite the unusual nature of your team and work environment. This will minimize unexpected problems and simplify troubleshooting. Best of luck, cheers.

One issue I can see is that you spelled Wikipedia incorrectly in link2.
We have absolutely no say in anything. The way they want to deliver the environment is packaged applications managed by a catalogue. We used to have local admin rights to help just get on with things, but understandably they're trying to move us into a much more controlled / managed space. The non tech code deployers are the biggest issue IMO, currently they need to be on very open machines, and they're possibly not as sighted of the risks that poses as the tech users. The main org is Win 10, but the tech users are still win 7. The tech users tend to also work on off list machines (mainly linux over win), so we're trying to have a minimally divergent estate to operate on... We're just dealing with the 2 to 3 transition. So standardising around the 3.6 build is fine. I really want to lean on ordered dicts as a default, and it seems sensible to sit on the latest as a good stable build for a while. They're saying 1 year minimum, its more likely to be 2 or 3 given my experiences elsewhere with that side of the shop. They have 3.4 packaged, but I'm arguing for 3.6 as a new package for the reasons I stated above - I'm not sure if I'm over stating the utility of 3.6 over 3.4 to be fair. We are also trying to establish better testing and versioning etc. We're currently very very wild west, and it doesn't help my arguments for allowing so flexibility on the info / op sec side if we're operating as a maverick userbase... That workflow / coding standards establishment is a whole other problem we're struggling with - thanks for bringing it up, its useful to get reminders of what "good" or "acceptable" ought to look like... 
Gonna leave this as a separate comment. I really like the code architecture, it's something I've been trying to do better lately myself. A few comments about that though: * [Why not use attrs here?](https://github.com/psincraian/pepy/blob/79928cddc1a262ca24cb9a9c2408e7dd0cc6e6f5/pepy/domain/model.py) These seem like value objects to me and attrs is really good with making those. * [Was this to avoid some sort of circular import?](from pepy.domain.exception import ProjectNameLengthIsNotValidException) * [Presumably the first line of the CSV handled here is headers?](https://github.com/psincraian/pepy/blob/79928cddc1a262ca24cb9a9c2408e7dd0cc6e6f5/pepy/application/command.py#L18) Why not use DictReader in that case? * [I like using timedelta(...).total_seconds() when dealing with second based timeouts](https://github.com/psincraian/pepy/blob/79928cddc1a262ca24cb9a9c2408e7dd0cc6e6f5/pepy/infrastructure/bq_downloads_extractor.py#L11) that might be something you consider as well. The benefit is that you don't have to worry about updating a comment or accidentally doing the multiplication wrong (something that's happened to me one too tired nights). * For [your DI needs](https://github.com/psincraian/pepy/blob/79928cddc1a262ca24cb9a9c2408e7dd0cc6e6f5/pepy/infrastructure/container/_start.py) have you looked at [Flask-Injector](https://github.com/alecthomas/flask_injector)? I'm using it in a small project right now and I think it's totally worth it * [Config is kind of gross](https://github.com/psincraian/pepy/blob/79928cddc1a262ca24cb9a9c2408e7dd0cc6e6f5/pepy/infrastructure/container/_config/__init__.py) I've approached it differently: [here's the code to find the config](https://github.com/justanr/gamenight/blob/master/src/gamenight/app/config/find.py) and [how it's invoked] might be some inspiration for you. * If you ever decide you want to use SQLAlchemy, but you're worried about polluting your domain with ORM stuff, [here's a way around that](https://github.com/justanr/gamenight/blob/968dad4b60179c6a2dbdc5006835eda7dc17640d/src/gamenight/app/repository/game.py#L42), I register the repo into a UOW manager that also has a configure method and then call UOW's configure method at application start up, all my models get wired to database stuff but stay conceptually pure in the architecture. * Point of advice on the CLI portion, once you reach a certain size [a custom group is *really* helpful](https://github.com/justanr/gamenight/blob/master/src/gamenight/cli/group.py) for example in [FlaskBB we use it to bootstrap plugin commands](https://github.com/flaskbb/flaskbb/blob/aa4cf874ffa2d785172336eabd74aa3d9b241248/flaskbb/cli/main.py#L46) But &lt;3 really nice.

I’ve been in similar positions before (wild Wild West). Not a fun place to be. 3.6 has a number of significant improvements over 3.4. First to mind, async await, type annotations, f-strings, lower memory usage with dictionaries and I believe better performance. I fully think it would be a mistake to migrate TO 3.4 today without very good reason (e.g. we need X package extensively and X package does not support beyond 3.4 and X package is 10M lines that we cannot rewrite ourself in a timely fashion). Note that such packages may be nonexistent, the big ones are all compatible IIRC.
I like your demeanor. Probably would enjoy working with you.
Damn, thought I did them all as commit links. 
Thanks heaps for that. That's really useful. :) 
Wow
Great work with the script. I have a suggestion for your access tokens. You could use an environment file for your access tokens. That way you would just have to read the contents of your file with a library like dotenv. The environment file can always be included in the .gitignore file. That way you wouldn't have to worry about it being checked in your repository. You can find more information on dotenv [here](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv)
no wtf?

That's good to know, I wasn't sure what the best way to store those was.
Since this might be helpful for others, the following worked for me I wrapped each write inside its own open command. open('./mymnt/mydev/io3/value', 'w') as f: f.write('0') open('./mymnt/mydev/io3/value', 'w') f.write('1') 
Hyperbole much? It's this kind of incredibly over the top bullshit that makes CoCs ruin the communities they pretend to protect snowflakes from. There are.mire that. A few communities that just disappeared after this crybaby bullshit started happening.
First time trying to use poetry. Trying `poetry init` in a folder that already has a package: &gt; poetry init This command will guide you through creating your poetry.toml config. Package name [....]: ...

You're exactly the poster boy for not adopting it Kenneth. You would have tried.ti use it.to shutdown conversation you dusagrerd with and kill an important signal of dissent against your product. You instead went to other forums to gin up support bc you couldn't CoC your way to the.top here. 
The first step is to give a shit about learning. The second step is to google "how do i learn python"
check the sidebar
Implementing most of those is really just understanding a language and then reading the spec, to be entirely honest. I’d recommend spending some time in basic language idioms in python (data structures and controls) and then reading the various specs, then writing them in python. The specs are language independent but describe the flow, requirements, and error paths fairly well (at least for oauth2).
I just published a new bugfix release (`0.10.1`) which should fix this issue.
I cringe at the use of single character variable names. Also, modifying a list while you're iterating through it isn't a great practice. Use list comprehension. 
I just made a RESTful enigma encoder for sending secret messages \([https://github.com/thecrimsoncoder/ghostWriter](https://github.com/thecrimsoncoder/ghostWriter)\) and now I'm making a arabic to roman numeral converter because I asked around for ideas and this seemed to be a nifty idea \([https://github.com/thecrimsoncoder/arabicToRoman](https://github.com/thecrimsoncoder/arabicToRoman)\). I have a 6 pack of random stuff, a house to myself with killer speakers and a whole night with the next day off ... let the games begin! cheers!
This actually seems really cool! Good luck!
I know that some anti\-virus/malware programs work off of hashes of programs \(which are known signatures\). Not sure if this is helpful but it seemed to be useful info to me.
Agree the Flash thing is annoying. But this article is rubbish. We recently had to move from Django Templates to using Jinja2 because it was simple for more complex templates Django got in the road with it's keep logic out of the template rule
naw dude, dont worry about it. Having a job is a learning experience within itself. If you already knew how to do it then it would not be a job. Take this as a learning opportunity to learn how to accomplish the goal and then take it that next step further, do things better, innovate. Anywho .... JSON objects \(yes JSON is JavaScript Object Notation, however its not like the javascript you have known to dislike\) may help you for some kind of persistent local database. Cheers!
Huh, that seems pretty neato! May I insist on another use case? Pick a random \(or genre based\) from [wallhaven.cc](https://wallhaven.cc) and set it. wallhaven has quality stuff!
3.7 comes out in about a week. I'd go with that.
Have you tried using Nasa's API instead? Using the chrome dev tools on the page you linked I found it was requesting data from this source `https://mars.nasa.gov/api/v1/news_items/?page=0&amp;per_page=40&amp;order=publish_date+desc%2Ccreated_at+desc&amp;search=&amp;category=19%2C165%2C184%2C204&amp;blank_scope=Latest`. It returns JSON data with an items array inside it that seems to be what you're actually looking for. In this case you might not need to use selenium.
Hey I was wondering if a package published with poetry is compatible with other types of packages. How does pip know how to install a poetry package that doesn't have a setup.py?
Ah. Sweet. Thats super useful. Thanks. I've secured a pause in decision making for a week or so, so thats nicely timed.

Yes I’m aware he’s in my class but he isn’t paying and is reviving partial answers I need full
Thank you! Oh, I really forgot to push `panfl` multi-argument CLI interface to panflute. It's really a simple one. I guess I'll add this to my issues.
Don't cheat. Do it or take your F like an adult
I saw the person bitching about being “passionless” and I admit I’m lazy but he point is it’s due TOMORROW or I wouldn’t be asking I started this class and was doing well I’m being programming but feel being in python
You're lazy and you're trying to trying to cheat. You're a dumbass.
And I deny non of those claims, your clearly uninterested in the offer so please leave
If you’ve never cheated then your a far better man then most
also PyQt / PySide (Qt is probably most recommended for anything complex needing native or professional look, also cross platform), GTK python bindings (forget the name, pyGObject?), Kivy (also does mobile, less native appearing, more modern and pythonic, seems better for like a multitouch game for example), BeeWare (), web things like Gooey or straight up flask/bottle/web2py....
Thanks. I'm using web scrappers because that's the tool I need to learn, but I just solved my issue, and it's a real kicker, because of how dumb and simple it was: I had to run browser.visit(url) within the same cell as the executable_path and browser objects. I was able to output the entire html for the page. Your initial answer was great tho, set me on the path to review what I was missing in the first place.
Since I have to clarify yes I’m a lazy cheating dumbass peice of shit I’ve heard it if you here to stat that your uninterested in helping and I know 
Maybe you should learn a lesson from this: "don't wait until the last minute." Maybe a couple of lessons, in fact, like : "pay attention in class" and "seek out your professor during office hours", for example.
That's not the way the internet works, sparky.
My mistake. A month.
I’m not in college dumbass we don’t have office hours, and if the teachers lesions helped I wouldn’t be asking, I fell behind as my impression of “introduction to computer programming would ease you in instead of expecting a strong math background and basic navigation 
I’m last second because I just caught up to use basic functions like interaction and such which was already expected to be known little to my knowledge 
As amused as I am discussing this with you I realize I have nothing to gain from this, feel free to comment but I’ll now only reply to it if I feel it I need to
I don't believe that's true. Cheating is not the norm and you shouldn't view it that way. I hope for your sake that you're not actually a CS major, because if you cheat your way through the intro course, you will have to cheat your way through the rest of the degree as well. Good luck in your cheating career
I like the idea I’m in college as much as it’s a death sentence to admit on the internet yes I am in fact a teen, and this is a EC class that I believe would teach basics instead of building off them which is why I’m behind sorry if that upsets you And yes cheating is the norm, not saying it’s good but most humans have cheated
Don't do that. Various packages have dropped Python 3.4 already. 3.6 at least.
Thanks. Thats useful to know. Valuable intel. 
Great. poetry is already the nicest packaging option and there's no doubt it will keep improving. Do you think it would be possible to add a command to enter a virtualenv? Typing `source env/bin/active` really annoys me and it would be nice if poetry had a command to detect the environment and start a shell within it.
Wow thank you so much. I didn't know there were so many libraries like that.
I greatly appreciate the disclaimer/footgun alert at the bottom of the post. Metaprogramming is an interesting tool...that you should almost never use.
Better to ask in /r/learnpython. If you need a number of files to run your program, put your project into something like github.com (it's free) and link to that.
Cool!! Also, don't worry about having to maintain 2.x compatibility, as that's already a year away from being completely dropped altogether, and might not work with type annotations and other language features you might be using.
Python in particular is like this - there's a lot of "how do I make this right" and "what's the one way to do this?" Java and C++ suffer from this a bit less.
Cool to have such a view. But isn't it misleading to put a cross on a feature a tool never claimed to address? It makes it look like a weakness when it's just not the goal of that tool. Say twine for instance, its objective is to manage your package distributions against Pypi, so it won't care much for dependencies or virtual environments...

Thank you&gt;&gt; I will keep posting things which got good content. Let me kno if you wanna know more about ML
Do really want to render the page? I don't quite understand. To receive the data, you need to open the developer tools in your browser and see what kind of requests your browser makes as you scroll down. You can then do the same thing in python.
Yes but I need python to make the request automated so I need python to first look at all the content then choose certain data to Make a different request
What kind of third-party packages do you use (if any)? There may be changes going forward or backward with version that will break some packages. I'd start by examining the 3rd party requirements to figure out mine. Now, if you ever need C extensions in Python (eg. Pandas, NumPy, Pillow etc.) you will also depend on the version of C compiler with which Python was built (if you are on MS Windows). Furthermore, if you do use 3rd party packages through PyPI not so long ago Python updated the version of SSL protocol used by its package management tools: `pip` and `easy_install` (because of PyPI migration), so, to be on the safe side, you would need to use a version later than the one where this update happened (unfortunately, I don't remember which one was it).
So? Look at the code - it's propably some kind of xhr request with a token.

If we extricate ourselves with personal quirks of some people, how should one decide between pipenv and poetry? Just a few days ago, I realized that I don't like to use pip "manually", and need some proper dependency management. I gave pipenv a try, and so far, it passed the [Principle of least astonishment] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment) - I wasn't negatively surprised by anything and it worked as I intuitively expected it to work. I also think that it is "philosophically correct" to bundle pip, virtualenv and requirements.txt together. Now I also want to evaluate poetry, since the doc indicates that it could also take care of the setup.py(?) That would probably make it even superior to pipenv.
**Principle of least astonishment** The principle of least astonishment (POLA) (alternatively "principle/law/rule of least astonishment/surprise") applies to user interface and software design, from the ergonomics standpoint. A typical formulation of the principle, from 1984, is: "If a necessary feature has a high astonishment factor, it may be necessary to redesign the feature." In general engineering design contexts, the principle means that a component of a system should behave in a way that users expect it to behave; that is, users should not be astonished by its behavior. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
&gt; I hope I will received the responsible response and suggestion. Sorry, this is reddit. /s But seriously, you probably should just try flask_reddit and see if it works for you. That's really the only way to be sure you can install and configure something that you can test to see if it satisfies your needs. If it doesn't install or satisfy your needs there are quite a few others out there. There's a review of a [few solutions here](https://fossbytes.com/best-open-source-reddit-alternatives-free/). A search should find many alternatives, like [discourse](https://github.com/discourse/discourse).
Wow, Thanks for the speed and support.
All good points. There no minimum spec here, we've all just been doing exactly as we please... I'm broadly aware of some of the moving parts behind the scenes (pip and c complier etc), I think the best I can do is just surface that there is system parts that extend beyond the python.exe binary... 
This is really comparing apples and oranges. Those kind of lists only make sense if you are comparing things with have the same purpose but offer different features. This is not the case here.
Pipenv works well for traditional projects that aren’t designed to be pip installable. Your web app for example. It doesn’t work so well for packaging a library. Poetry works well for libraries that are meant to be packaged. I don’t know how well it works for app development 
I seriously can't think of a case where inferred types would lead to a hard to track down error. I mean function args, return values, and class members still require explicit type notation, and if you create a type mismatch, the ide will tell you exactly what it expected, and what it inferred. This is the future, little human. Don't be afraid.
Thanks for that. &gt; A search should find many alternatives, like discourse. Yup, I tried discourse and currently using it for a discussion community but it has some limitation as it is designed for a different need. &gt; There's a review of a few solutions here. Thanks for this list. It seems it solved my problem.
I thought the same. The first thing I thought before opening was "ok, here comes camel case, zero list comprehensions, heaps of explicit for loops and, paradoxically coming from a mandatory classes language, no classes at all". Not criticising OP at all(it's a very nifty script!), I just work with Java devs and the Python they write always looks like this to start with. Eventually they start finding the elegant Pythonic idioms and conventions, and the structural balance between rigid Java structure and a mostly unstructured script full of global state. Either that or they simply refuse to write Python like Python and then incessantly complain about how terrible it is because it isn't literally Java :P 
`@forge.sign(**forge.FSignature.from_callable(bar))` is the solution I was looking for. It's basically `@delegate_args`. I suggest you: 1. Make a convenience function with a short name that does this, because right now it's very verbose. 2. Put it at the front of the docs. Seriously, why is this not the first thing people see? This is the main problem that people need to solve and it's an easy, DRY way to solve it. 3. Make a patch to `typing` with your version of `@delegate_args`, and a patch to `mypy` that responds to it accordingly. You have a great opportunity to get something into the standard library, that's very exciting. This is also the only way you can get compatibility with linters, which I think is a must. Remember that with your solution above, pylint flags `func(1, 2)` as an error. Keep the patches as small as possible. Most of what's in forge is not going to go into the standard library. Just focus on your version of `@delegate_args`. I am curious to see a real-life use case for forge other than giving multiple functions the same signature. Can you show me one?
Maybe you should try [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/)? It packs everything (including Python) into a stand-alone executable so you don't depend on the Python version installed on a machine.
Not that well, it seems to be mainly designed for packages. That's why I'm using both : pipenv to propose reproductible python env for my research, poetry for packaging my libraries.
In the Netherlands, we have a website like Ebay, where you can sell your secondhand stuff. The problem is that after a few days, your advert will be passed page 5 and will only get a few views a day. I created a python script that automates placing the advert. So if I click run, the script runs through an array of adverts I want to place. I'm using Selenium to make this work.
I'll take a look. That could be useful. Thanks. 
Very nice tutorial! I really liked the technologies you used! I did something similar (but way more hacky) to this a few times. Once through python by calling the coinmarketcap API and displaying the prices + some portfolio statistics using the prettytable package. Another one by calling the coinmarketcap API with javascript and display the statistics in a table on the webpage.

Move them all under the class's `__init__`: self.fwd = None self.rwd = None self.vin_choice = None self.gear_box_choice = None self.value = None self.running = None 
/r/learnpython Instead of your methods pulling values from global space you can either pass the values when calling the methods, or somehow keep them as state on the instance. I your case, instead of collection all the input in the on_click handler and writing it to globals you put them in a small object and pass that to the next functions (call it scrape params or a session or something), or save them as attributes on the class (kinda messy). Also your code is a bit odd in that you define functions inside a very nested loop. This is a smell that things are messy. You should lift these definitions to class level (or module level even) and pass the values they need as arguments. 
Just did a precursory glance through OP's code and I second this method. If it somehow breaks your code, just wrap the whole thing up in another class and implement __mahi__'s suggestion inside the class' __init__ 
Try TravisCI.
Normally you publish the package, then a user reports a problem and you tell them that you can't fix it as you don't have Windows. Someone else does it, because it's open source, and you accept their PR. Maybe you pay a barely qualified consultant to do it next time. He just mocks sys.platform or something to return different values. It has no effect. So try CI. Travis should be able to do it, right? No, not on Windows. Then you cry, and start collecting VMs :-/
&gt; installs specific Python versions to system &gt; `pipenv` and `pyenv` are checked Wait, really? Does `pipenv` really allows you to install various Python versions like `pyenv`? Could you please give a link to `pipenv` docs where this feature is mentioned?

If your only control is increase/decrease of an input value, you don't really need a neural network. You can simply use [control theory](https://smile.amazon.com/Feedback-Control-Computer-Systems-Introducing/dp/1449361692) which is surprisingly robust for this kind of application. That book uses Python to demo the concepts. You can of course use any language. Also, it's a pretty short book and you only need the 1/3 - 1/2 of it. Basically just the PID controller part. You say you want to "optimize" the value but neither the neural network nor the PID controller are going to be able to do that. They attempt to hit a target--it's up to you to define that target.
Yes, but these are just keyboard controls, Getting Over It plays on mouse only input, would that still be possible for an AI to learn?
This typically falls into the realm of hosted CI, though there's no one good solution for all platforms. So it ends up being a Frankenstein's Monster of Travis (for Linux + some MacOS, though you'll wait quite a while on those Mac jobs) plus Appveyor (for Windows + some Linux, with similar caveats) plus Tox for multiple versions of Python. Basically the more you can limit the growth of the matrix of things you want to support, the better.

I'm curious.. you said that you are a Java dev, but I don't see any object on the *.py file... could be interesting for you refactor your project to use objects and add tests?
Thank you!
Yes sir 
Unfortunately there isn't any kind of formal testing structure or accepted best practice for this. I use vagrant to create VMs for various different kinds of machines and then pip install on them. If possible, I try and make my code platform independent by depending on modules that abstract away platform differences.
`gldas.groupby('time.month').mean('time')` is correct. The *problem* is that your time index is of type float, rather than datetime64 - fix that and it should be work. 
We have no idea what you are trying to do, so there's no way for us to know how to make it do that.
Sorry, I’m trying to find the number of 0s in 500factorial,, but I have it set up to check every number individually to see if it equals 0 and to add to the counter but even when it’s 0==0 it returns false
So you want to run your own package index that's separate from PyPI?
Yes ;) And pulling the module must be protected by password or token to avoid public pulling our modules.

Ah alright well, my project is optimizing a pid controller with actively changing P, I and D values. As there are patterns in the sensor data, when compared with the input values. There is a reason I need this but it would take far too much explaining.

Couple things beyond just your string comparison: - There is a `math` module in the standard library, and it has an optimized factorial function. You can use it like so: import math math.factorial(500) - Strings have a `count` method which can count appearances of a substring, as in: str(SOME_NUMBER).count('0')

It would seem your insight is accurate. In their terms of use, the following is restricted: "using any "spider", "bot", "data miner" or any other program, device or methodology to access, acquire, copy, or monitor the Site;" 
You could try to formulate a coherent question? Did you read it back at all?
What about operating system level service? Like keychain and such secret storages?
That too is unlikely to work. How can the OS distinguish between the python script you wrote, and a copy of the same script that Alice made where she prints out the secrets? It basically can't in either case it sees a python interpreter asking for some data from the keyring, and it is either configured to respond to that request or it is not. This is why it is almost impossible to secure scripting languages outside of a client/server model.
&gt; Metaclasses are deeper magic than 99% of users should ever worry about. If you wonder whether you need them, you don’t (the people who actually need them know with certainty that they need them, and don’t need an explanation about why)
/r/learnpython might help. You need to go to google (or go to stack overflow) and lookup how to open files and how to parse strings in python.
That's not enough information. It's very important that you learn to ask questions properly if you want people to spend a their time helping you. In this particular case, I will asumme you used TUI for "terminal user interface" (although you should make that clearer) and that you are scripting with Python (despite the fact you make no mention of such things, you are on /r/Python after all, but I've seen things...). Now, because it's seems like a beginer question, I will make a best guess (guessing again, which is not good for helping, and at this stage a lot of people already decided not to help you) and say you just make a script, and are not coding the terminal. Then, I'm discarding a lot of data you give ("I'm crawling news from a Hungarian site (UTF-8: é, á for instance)"), because it feels like it's not relevant to the problem at all. Finger crossing you are not just very confused and that I'm right on this. After all that, I have to type this answer to explain to you this entire process, so you don't do it again. Actually, I have to retype it. I started to type it in a terribly agressive tone. After I read it again, I deleted it and wrote it again in a more helpful manner. Remember we have hundreds of people like you making the same mistake every day. Only at this stage can I start answering the question, which will inevitably starts a ping poing of comments with you. I really want you to grab the issue with this. Ok, so the (approximate best guess) answer is, you can't choose the size of the letters on a terminal from a script. Script don't control the terminal, they just get input and outputs from it. Only the user of said terminal can change the size of the text, which is done by controlling the font size in the terminal settings. It's an operation that is different on each type of terminal. 
Ah, so I assume the application has to be signed or something? Could OP wrap his script with one of those executable creators (pyExe) and make that acceptable for the OS? 
I have had to solve a similar problem in my own package. I settled on [a global config](https://github.com/brandondube/prysm/blob/master/prysm/conf.py) with a callback system. In particular, I allow the user to hot swap numpy or cupy (CPU or GPU) with code that looks something like this: from prysm import config config.backend = 'cuda' [This is done by registering a list of functions to call with the new backend](https://github.com/brandondube/prysm/blob/master/prysm/conf.py#L95), basically the observer pattern. I have a centralized [math](https://github.com/brandondube/prysm/blob/master/prysm/mathops.py) file, which [has a function that overwrites the imports in `globals()`](https://github.com/brandondube/prysm/blob/master/prysm/mathops.py#L166). This pattern allows hot swapping provided users don't try to mix objects from before the backend switch. It does mean you can't do from numpy import sin from prysm.mathops import sin and instead must do import prysm.mathops as m m.sin() which is a consideration. This also depends on `numpy` and `cupy` providing identical APIs, which they do. If you need to gloss over differences in APIs, I would write wrapper functions and then consider using this hot swap technique to allow the user to select things. Or do I misunderstand what you are trying to do?

Currently working on my portfolio/blog. in an effort to learn python and backend dev at the same time, I decided to make a website with it... I am using flask as my framework if you’re curious. Hopefully it’ll be finished in the next month or so, if I keep working on it at my current pace. Wish me luck xo.
fixing kinks in the serverless GDPR consent api we build so it automatically deletes all personal data from all databases all over the place... The thing is a monster and half the dbs do not do what the people operating them told us they do, fun times. 
I'm working on a program to download Twitch streams and the Twitch chat as soon as the streamer is live. I was hoping to recreate the Twitch chat style in Python but I think it'll be easier in HTML/JavaScript/CSS.
Does it matter? The question's been deleted so no-one remembers what it was about anyway.
&gt; Not that well, it seems to be mainly designed for packages What makes you say that? I am really curious because when I started Poetry I wanted it to be able to manage any Python project, being an application or a library. I use it myself to development applications so I am not sure where this misconception about Poetry is coming from.
I love you. I have been looking for this forever.
There's a better way to solve this problem. Think about how a 0 gets on the end of a product.
That's something I have in mind yes. I can't give you an ETA yet about when this will land into Poetry but that's definitely something I plan on adding.
I'm sure there is a way to make it work, but it isn't easy and is bound to be fragile. The better solution is a client/server model with the database secured on the server. That doesn't mean the database server has to be independent. It could be running on localhost but as a different user.
I was really happy when I saw that my bot **actually** initiates some trades on the crypto exchange. I used the ccxt library from [Github](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt). Very simple and cool. ;)

Sitting down with a copy of [Vallado](https://smile.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Astrodynamics-Applications-Technology-Library/dp/1881883183/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1527606660&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=vallado) and trying to create a self-consistent, documented satellite-observation library that handles the kind of data I deal with. All the existing ones do juuuust the wrong thing. I have almost all my basic functions, now I need to vectorize it and do a few other things.

I do not agree with the opening line: &gt; this is both a Kenneth project and a PyPA project. The PyPA isn't 'in charge' of anything besides the organization itself, individual volunteers maintain each individual project in the PyPA which is a loose collective and always has been. Pipenv is a project started by Kenneth, but appears to currently be owned by PyPa. It is as simple a question to me of who owns the repository, or more specifically if Kenneth's role in PyPa is "owner", "admin", "member", or "contributor." One would also ask why the PyPa exists at all as an organization if they are not in charge of anything. The role of organizations is to hold IP and administrate projects. All of this kerfluffle really tarnishes the name of pipenv, and does both Kenneth and the PyPa a disservice. I do not know the cleanest way to get out of it, except maybe just being quiet and keeping their heads down for a while. Locking out issues really isn't the way to go. Given Kenneth's recent vandalism of the pipenv repo on `master`, IMO he should not have push access anymore, though I do acknowledge the severity and consequences of such an action.
Why would some one waste time writing an issue like this?
r/ProgrammingProbs
If I had to guess, it would buy when the average price is below a threshold and sell when it is above?
I started one with the same idea haha (though I was planning on building the backend separately, and do the design later), not worked on it in a while though. Are you keeping it basic or trying to add features like accounts?
I finally finished up the first part of my news aggregation summary site (a tdlr type deal) , and moved it to articlebits.com but i realize i don't use it that much. been trying to experiment with google text to speech the gTTS module to see if creating mp3 files that I can listen to would be more useful for me to try and keep up with the news. The problem is that it has weird pauses. does anyone know of how to phrase sentences or what sort of spaces you need in order to get the text to speech more natural? 
Excuse myself, I wanted to say that I missed few features to easily use poetry in my workflow for application or reproductible research : maybe not by design, but more because the library is young (but the features increase with an impressive speed !). In the previous version, I missed the new "init" command : I welcome it. I think that a "shell" command (as in pipenv) would be welcome too. I want to highlight the quality of your work in that lib too : with this new version, I will certainly replace my olds Pipfiles.
First announced this last week, but some minor progress: I'm continuing work on a toy programming language implemented in Python and powered by LLVM: [https://github.com/syegulalp/Akilang/](https://github.com/syegulalp/Akilang/) "Eventually, this might become something useful for production. Right now, it's strictly proof\-of\-concept \-\- a fun toy for me to hack on and to learn about compiler theory and programming language construction in the process." This week I did a little more work to allow multiple target platform support, cleaned up code for one of the examples \(Conway's Life\), and am now looking at tracing heuristics for how to manage heap\-allocated memory. We have a mechanism for allocating and deallocating memory, but I'd like to make it as automatic as possible for heap\-allocated objects that go in and out of scope in a predictable way.
Nah, the Gadsden flag is a classic
I do plan on adding accounts for things like comments, likes, downloads (when applicable, ) but I have no experience handling sensitive user data like passwords, emails, etc, that’s also not considering things like the GDPR. I think I’ll keep it basic for now, but I’ll definitely add accounts when I have the proper knowledge. Also, I was going to do the backend stuff with flask and front end with react... but I decide to keep it strictly python and use Jinja as my templating engine with some JavaScript... mainly because I really want to focus on learning python, it’s by far my most favorite language that I’ve used by a long shot, compared to the other ones I used before it.
Is there any place to check for the Shiboken examples? I am dealing with a lot of dll's and header files and I believe this library could speed up tremendously my work, but I am clueless regarding where to start. 
If you have an internal git server \(or private repos somewhere\), you can install directly from it. It is not as succinct as:: pip install package but it is not as bad either:: pip install git\+https://USER\_NAME@GIT\_URL/PATH\_TO\_YOUR\_REPO.git
Who gives a shit.

He pushed a series of commits (e.g. https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/commit/6d77e4a0551528d5d72d81e8a15da4722ad82f26) that replaced the description of pipenv in the introduction to the documentation with various nasty things that people have said about it.
Thanks for the feedback. I'll create one for wallheaven too later.
Literally what I need for (one of the many) personal project! Thank you!
[removed]
Thanks! It worked.
Thanks for the kind words. A `shell` command (or similar) is planned. However, you can have a similar behavior by running `poetry run your-shell` (for instance for `zsh` you would run `poetry run zsh`). This will activate the virtualenv.
They wrote pipenv because they thought it would be of value in the space and the tag line reflects their main philosophy. Of course they think their APIs are better. That's why they wrote them. This is a total non issue. Kenneth has received some flak lately which may have been deserved but there's nothing if any importance in that issue thread.
You can buy it in PDF, if you don't also have an aversion to paying.
Losing motivation on my pet projects: - https://github.com/eltrhn/ergo - https://github.com/eltrhn/rueltabel Context for the latter (a higher-level and more powerful language for specifying cellular-automata rules than the language [Golly](http://golly.sourceforge.net), a popular tool, supports by default): - http://conwaylife.com/wiki/Tutorials/Creating_custom_rules (strange writing style but informative) - https://github.com/GollyGang/ruletablerepository/wiki/TheFormat - http://golly.sourceforge.net/Help/formats.html#table The former was made *for* the latter because I got so darn tired of working around argparse, but it's only a week old (and was pretty much finished in two days) so it still has plenty of nits to work out. I need to figure out a way to separate clumps by group (the reason for which is a bit too complicated to explain in this parenthetical), and I also still have to write tests and actual docs/docstrings/comments for it... yegh.
I agree that's verbose. Hmm. Going to have to think about the name. `@forge.delegate(func)` or `delegate_args` seems to give the appearance that it's actually delegating something (and it's not). So maybe `@forge.adapt(func)`. After I patch `forge` with that convenience function and update the docs, I'll chime into the [`typing`](https://github.com/python/typing/issues/270) letting them know about `forge`. I've not played around with the internals of `typing`/`mypy` so I'm unclear on what would be needed to make type-hinting work. Do you have any ideas on that?
Have you seen the Flask microblog tutorial made by Miguel Grinberg? It's fantastic for getting an idea of the things you can do with flask. Here's the link if you're interested: https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world

Will definitely check it out, thank you.
Wonderful - thanks very much. This has given me a much better avenue to consider! A global config is something I played with before, but I passed around a dictionary. This was a silly way of doing things and your way seems much better.
First of all sorry for my behavior, didn't see much benefit to post the code because it ends up with simple print commands. `import requests` `import time` `from bs4 import BeautifulSoup` `links = []` `def get_news(link):` `headline1 = ""` `time.sleep(2)` `r = requests.get(link)` `site = BeautifulSoup(r.content, 'html.parser')` `article = site.find_all("that_article")` `for cont in article:` `headline1 = cont.find('h1').string` `headline2 = cont.find('h2').string` `newstext = cont.find_all("p")` `print(headline1)` `print(headline2)` `print(newstext[1].text)` `if __name__=="__main__":` `r = requests.get('`[`http://thatsite.hu`](http://thatsite.hu)`')` `soup = BeautifulSoup(r.content, 'html.parser')` `for card in` [`soup.select`](https://soup.select)`(".box_h"):` `if card.string == "sometext":` `area = card.find_next()` `for part in area.find_all('a'):` `href = part.get('href')` `links.append(href)` `for link in links:` `get_news(link)` Thanks for the patience!
Please!
I just integrated a map API into my application, but I used Google Maps. Is there any advantage in using mapbox?
You're thinking about this wrong. Your code itself should be reporting on its progress so you don't have to try to deduce it from indirect metrics like resource usage.
The calls are cheaper but in my experience the results aren’t as accurate for things like reverse geo coding. Overall pretty good for simple apps.
Thanks for regurgitating the drama here. I don't care who "wins" the title of The Best And Only Packaging Thingy. They all suck and are good in their own ways and its only important that something comes out as at least a widely\-used and acknowledged standard. Just ignore the drama, stop trying to stir up more drama. Even if the posted issue was made in ignorance of the recent drama around the project it's a silly thing to waste developer bandwidth with. No one worth caring about is choosing or not choosing a project because it says "for humans" on the tin.
Hey, I was playing around with this code today. You mention that refresh_token doesn’t change. How did you get that token in the first place? I can get the access_code but can’t seem to get refresh code. Apologies I am very new to this. Thanks. 
The outspoken minority of Python is so annoying. Just use something else if you don't like pipenv. There are real cry babies in this subreddit that somehow get upvotes. People attack Kenneth personally and it's sick. The open source community is full of toxic people that have nothing better to do than sit in their basement and belittle other people for their great work. If you have a problem, make a better solution.

Hi, You should try reading the documentation (especially the FAQ). Specifically, [Why does on_message make my commands stop working?](http://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/async/faq.html#why-does-on-message-make-my-commands-stop-working) Additionally, this is more of a question for /r/learnpython or even more appropriately, the [discord.py Discord guild](https://discord.gg/r3sSKJJ). /r/python is used more to discuss about the language itself, rather than to get help with coding. Hope this helps! \- SN
Pyperclip won't let you copy an integer value; put quotes around your numbers to indicate that the passwords will be strings.
Thanks it works , but why this happen can you explain it.

For scripts, global vars are fine, IMO.

I reckon you're overthinking it - * `123` is a number, it's equal to twelve thousand, three hundred forty-five, it's less than a million and greater than one. `123+4` is equal to `127`. * `"123"` is a text string; it has none of these properties. `"123"+"4"` is equal to `"1234"`. * `pyperclip` is a python library that's been developed to copy text to your system clipboard. It throws an error if you pass it anything except text, which is what happened to you.
Reading or editing executables of any kind on any platform is not impossible. It is just harder. Something like py2exe is going to have a bundle (probably in zip format, but could be something else) of python library bytecode. The user could browse to that zip file, open it, and search within that bytecode for the functions that access the database, to try and find the password. Even with fully compiled languages it is possible to do a similar thing by disassembling the code and looking at the underlying assembly. This isn't always the easiest thing in the world to do, but it isn't impossible. Finally if you have a password or key embedded in an executable, that is often something that really stands out. We know it resides in the text segment, we know it is fairly long. If it is a password it might be ascii... so one could take the approach popularized in the game fallout and just run "strings" on an executable and look for a password in the file contents. You may decide that some of these approaches are beyond the technical capabilities of your adversary, and that you don't have to worry about them. But I would be cautious with making assumptions about what other people are able to do. A cleaner separation between an unprivileged client and a privileged database server would probably server you better in the future. 
Thanks for the help. 
Python can have unclear pass by value / pass by reference semantics. If you use a class, you guarantee your objects end up behaving like pass by reference, and you can set up things like triggers on property changes!
Ok, maybe because you are doing text = "[japanesechars]".decode() Try doing text = "[chars]" text.decode()
No errors at all, it just spits out the weird text.
Ah :(
You could try importing Unicode literals from future?
Ok, replace Def getAge(string) &lt;--- (just change string to your user_age variable)
Great feedback. I added a row that captures the purpose of the tool, another that captures which relevant packaging tools each of them depend on. I also added a table to compare file formats. It's somewhat incomplete, but I will keep chipping away at it and filling it in. There is so much content now that it doesn't really fit on a github readme anymore, so I am going to consider of ways to present the information.
Look at selenium 
Gonna try poetry too. Pipenv started getting on my nerves (needed to --rm and reinstall my virtual environment few times in order to get it to work)
Never mind. Figured it out 🤦🏻‍♀️ thanks
Why not just use pip with git? I *think* you can even make a requirments file with those in it.
Spotify documents the process pretty well in their authorization guide: https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#authorization-code-flow If you follow the "Authorization Code Flow" process, you should receive your access_token and refresh_token in the same response. When you say "access_code", are you referring to "access_token" or "code?" There's an intermediate step in the authorization process in which Spotify gives you a code that certifies the user has authorized your app. You then have to exchange this code for the access and refresh tokens. I don't have any of the authorization code included in this script -- I performed the auth flow I linked to prior to writing the script, so I already had all the tokens I needed. Hope this helps.

&gt; executable file from the python script using PyInstaller. So my code is not really readable or editable Sure it is. Usually a .exe file is just a zip with a bunch of stuff in it, anyone with sufficient know-how can do whatever they want with it. To be honest it sounds like you're trying to solve a problem with the wrong solution. It's such a common problem with support questions that it has a name: The [xy problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem). Try figuring out what you *actually* want to do and maybe ask how best to achieve that goal.
**XY problem** The XY problem is a communication problem often found in help desk or similar situations, in which the cause of a problem is masked because the person asking for help has presented incomplete information as to the source of their problem. This ambiguity in the real source of a problem leads to wrong, inaccurate, or unhelpful solutions being offered. The issue arises when the person with the problem thinks that they themselves have a partial solution to their problem, and only ask for the parts they think they are "stuck" on. On the other side, the people offering to help lack information as to the root problem, and thus cannot provide ultimately useful information. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Thanks. Yes, i spent ages on it for some reason. I missed the step where you exchange the "code" for access and refresh tokens. Still couldn't write the request to get that "code", just posted the URL in the browser with Google as Redirect_uri. Thanks so much for this 👌🏼
It's useful in the sense that it can help you determine which tools offer the functionality that you're interested in. There are so many tools, it can be easy to miss which one you need to do X.
The error you get simply means that user_age is not defined in the scope of the function. Your argument should be user_age instead of string. Also, your again() function, although quite simple has a fundamental flaw : you can't run the program more than a 1000 times before exceeding the recursion limit. I'd suggest using a while loop instead.
I like the summarizations on the site! How are you picking the key sentences? are you using textRank or a custom algorithm? 
7 in the morning, before you start work, at your lunch break, and before you cry yourself to sleep.
Generally speaking unless you're doing something low level with signal handling or C library functions via ctypes you won't run into this issue. If it's a matter of "I know one one OS the location of X is in place Y, on another it is place Z", it's safe to test via mocking out the source of your conditional test (ex, the presence of something in the os environ is how I detect debian vs other linux distros, it's safe to use `mock.patch.dict` to fake it).
I am not in a lab but these examples and article was rly good overall. Any chance you want to share code to check queue memory length And halt the queue?
I don't think the MIT license applies to non software. I don't know what license you want to choose, but this is something that the [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) licenses cover. That said, it may be good to mention pip-tools and hatch as well, even though they work at lower and (imo) higher levels respectively.
Not really, because with how polluted the ecosystem is, it's useful to have a "what's what" to help beginners understand.
To be honest, I couldn't find an answer to that question [https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/8n15wk/how\_to\_determine\_the\_maximum\_possible\_size\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/8n15wk/how_to_determine_the_maximum_possible_size_of/) So if you come across any information, please do let me know 
Question, why a clone when instead you can install the archives? https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit
Thanks, I will add pip-tools and hatch. If you feel inclined you can submit a PR, but I'll get to it eventually. I was thinking about the CC license too, will change as well.
For short, disposable scripts I would agree. What bothers me is the suggestion to put them in __init__. Are the variables any less global there? Something just doesn't look right about that but I'm far from an expert Python programmer.
This isn't drama, this is stupidity. I'll be the first one to call out Kenneth's extreme bullshit. And I did in response to his letter. But the tagline is both *accurate* (it makes a lot of things easier) and synonymous with the creator (in the Python development community). It's like me making lots of useful packages that are uncommon, and me adding the tagline "'cause no one else gives a damn", only for people to want it removed. ...and it isn't people. This is one person, and it is seemingly spawned from the original drama as a spiteful act. However, this line and the corresponding details &gt; this is both a Kenneth project and a PyPA project Only serve to reiterate one of the main points of the initial drama-- the unnecessary, overbearing officialese and marketing from Kenneth and PyPA of the package.
Yes this is also a bit unclear to me... how to complete workflow with poetry and virtualenv should be. In pipenv virtualenv is just incorporated into it, with poetry I am not sure.
Errr. Isn't this just putting a setting in django for the api token? The rest is javascript.
I wouldn't call it minority, firstly, and again, the personal attacks are disgusting. But the overwhelming majority of the original criticism was indeed constructive, and to the project itself.
Many thanks for your time! I think I will apply all of these suggestions to the code, there were some features of Python that I didn't know, like attrs or DictReader, and makes the life easier. I like the way you architectured all the code and how you use some of the python features. I think I will take a closer look at your project to get some more inspiration. Many thanks for sharing! 😊
this guys humor is concerning. the information is helpful though. thank you

"interactive" must be zero in order # # to specify a user/password. # instart(WindowsServiceManager, 'HighAvailabilityWindowsServiceManager', 'HighAvailabilityWindowsServiceManager', \ # stay_alive = True, \ # interactive = 0, \ # userName = ".\\AdminUser", \ # password = "admin_user_password", \ # delayed = True # ) # if called without argvs, let's run ! win32serviceutil.HandleCommandLine(WindowsServiceManager) ``` Note this is python2, and I may have missed an import or two (or have an extraneous one or two). You should be able to use `pyinstaller` to create a onefile `myservice.exe`, then a command something like this would install it as a service: ``` myservice.exe --user=".\UserToRunAs" --password="users-password" --startup="auto" install ``` 
'_' can be used as a throw-away variable. It looks like methods that return a value are being used, but the return value is not needed by the program.
Done 🚀 
That's sort of dumb. Usually the underscore is used when you *can't* avoid getting a certain return value -- for instance, `first, _ = some_str.split('/', 1)` to signify that you don't care at all about what's after the first slash -- but here it has the same effect as (and looks much much worse than) just writing the function without assigning its return value to anything. Does your instructor write `_ = print(...)` too...?
Yes, they are less global. They aren't referenced in the global namespace, and instead are only referenced as attributes of the class instance. To me, at a glance, it looks like OP's App class maintains state of of Qt specific stuff inside the class, but scraper/domain specific stuff in the global state. It's technically fine for it to be global, especially in a script that is so specific to a particular site, which is unlikely to be reused. However, global state variables could contribute to name collisions in larger projects using multiple libraries, and also deprive users of the the module of the ability to inherit from a self\-sufficient class object that maintains its own state internally. Additionally, if you wanted to make the whole thing work with async or threads or something, I could see the usage of global state being an obstacle to that objective. It's relevant to note that the role of the self.\_\_init\_\_\(\) is not actually purely to declare class attributes, but is more generally just a sequence of instructions to execute when the object is instantiated for the first time. Class instance attributes are declared in self.\_\_init\_\_\(\) as part of that process all the time to set the initial state of the object.
I was expecting this to be about getting the image size from the request header without downloading the image.
&gt; Also your code is a bit odd in that you define functions inside a very nested loop. This is a smell that things are messy. You should lift these definitions to class level \(or module level even\) and pass the values they need as arguments. OP, if you take no other advice in this thread, take this advice. To further elaborate: Functions/methods are best when they simply take input and return output\-\-rather than being called to modify state somewhere outside of the function, be it global or within the class. It helps the function to be flexible and reusable \(sometimes important\), but also makes it much easier to understand the flow of the program, and what the function is actually doing.
I was in your shoes, I found a project I was passionate about, and started pursuing my dreams of possibly having my own startup. I used my large python project and various technologies to show I can program well. It will get your foot in the door(and you can pass a few coding tests). THink of a cool large django project, and start building 
Lets say you have a CPU with 2 cores and up to 4 threads. If using multiprocessing, would you 4 processes to take full advantage of that cpu?
Thanks, I really appreciate it! 
im gonna share what you want in 1 day. Keep follow [opensourceprojects.org](https://opensourceprojects.org) mate.
Seems to be an issue with stdout because the encoding is chcp680 or something like that no matter what
 import time import sys import os for i in range(5): f = open('mount1.txt', 'r') file_contents = f.read() print (file_contents) time.sleep(0.1) os.system('clear') a = open('mount2.txt', 'r') file_contents = a.read() print (file_contents) time.sleep(0.1) os.system('clear') raw_input("Press RETURN to finish.") sys.exit()
p.s os.system\(\`clear\`\) does nothing it should not be there
Very interesting, i wasn’t aware of ChilKat. What do you use it for?
Typically means that the value will not be used. However in this cases it looks like that entire assignment is pointless. Either there was some other motivation or whoever wrote this code doesn't know what he's doing.
You can get free access to that service with library membership at some libraries, too. Off the top of my head, I know you can with Seattle Public Library. 
No it's cool. I used rss feeds where I could and scraped where I couldn't. Then going through and cleaning up to try and remove ads and Twitter links and such.
I don't have Python 2.7 installed, but have you tried using [unicode strings](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/introduction.html#unicode-strings)? text = u"ぜっちん​ドッスンや。マリオちゃうで" print text.encode("utf-8")
Hard to say without seeing any code. I would have a hard time building and app that has root.destroy() anywhere in there. Build a component that displays the data. If it changes, throw away that component and grid or place a new one on the screen. This will be far less evasive than that method.
I develop Python 3.6 on Windows 10 and deploy to Linux. Run all my unit tests in both locations. No real issues. I'm flask instead of Django, but also using RabbitMQ and some other multiprocessing pieces. Developing your code in a Docker image may also be an option. It will run on a linux-y place on Windows. If you don't need a ton of power to run this, you might look at the decent Chromebooks that people successfully load with Ubuntu, instead of ChromeOS. You could get a reasonably portable and cheap device. I've never had an issue with non-graphics intensive work in a VM, if I ran the VM full screen. If you are allowed to have a VM environment on your work laptop, that might be an easy way to go. It seems like your issue was copy paste between native and VM. Work in the VM like it is another laptop. No copy paste issues. 
I use cartopy for such matters 
Build stuff that you’ll use! Little flask apps with a front end, command line tools, automate some boring tasks etc. Programming is so deep, you’ll never know it all! And you don’t need to either. Keep going and over time you’ll build a solid foundation of knowledge. 
... likely more since your kernel will load balance ... and the processes will likely have periods of inactivity/sleep. Like when you make a DB call or socket request the process is going to sleep and do absolutely nothing until you get a response... having a few extra processes ensures you're going to have something actually running during these periods. The most efficient thing to do is actually use async code (which will flip over to another coroutine/etc instead of just locking) ... but that's going to be quite a bit more advanced than just cutting things into a couple processes.
Continuing work on the follow bot but I need a little input. Here is what I have working and where I am stuck: Working... * Code to drive motors - complete * Code to recognize aruco code and spit out dimensional information to an array - complete * Code to link the aruco code to send a signal to the motors in order to know which way to go - ummmmm Honestly I am not sure about the methodology of deriving which direction to go from the information I am given. Not even really sure where to start. Any ideas would be appreciated.
I say keep going with the database stuff. I’m am partial to postgresql, but whatevs. I think many companies can’t right their own requirements so having a breadth of knowledge should go a long way in helping them out. Also look into web stuff. It’s really annoying and chaotic, but it’s what’s happening now and for the foreseeable future. 
Is this a thing now? I vaguely remember asking around in the pypa IRC channel and being told warehouse was not really intended to run on premise, and devpi or something like that was a better option
Yeah, same issue unfortunatly :/
Hey, Moonkis, just a quick heads-up: **unfortunatly** is actually spelled **unfortunately**. You can remember it by **ends with -ely**. Have a nice day! ^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
I think there are two approaches you can take to this. One is to have a specific goal, and to build up your knowledge in pursuit of that, e.g. wanting to create a web crawler or computer vision system. Though whatever you choose might be completely unrelated to what employers "look for", the skills you'll pick up along the way won't be, and on top of that, having something to work on that you find interesting and engaging will help. The other path is to just learn more general/advanced Python. One really easy method for this is to start going through [Python MOTW](https://pymotw.com/3/), which covers the Python standard library modules - reading through, seeing what captures your interest, noticing cases in which you could've used standard library functionality in programs you've previously written. You can also talks from PyCon and Europython on Youtube (I'd recommend sorting by popularity) - they tend to be very informative and well presented.
And that is why another set of eyes always helps. Problem solved. Thank you so much haha
You can actually just click on it to continue reading for a bit, so that's kinda not quite as horrible. But don't worry, you're not missing anything. This "tutorial" actually recommends Python 3 over the "newly released python 3". Literally the only code in the entire "tutorial" is `print "hello world"`. I'm very tempted to assume that this is malicious click bait since there is no discernible effort whatsoever.
Yeah, the solution for *most* ad block detectors is to disable JavaScript on that site. But you're right -- it's a low-effort post with virtually no content.
Ok, my assumptions were right then. You can consider the last paragraph of my previous answer as definitive.
AFAIK ipython have no "auto-autocomplete" (I mean predictions on typing without extra keystrokes), that is why I use bpython for last couple years.
Sorry but I don't feel landing a decent job at a reputable firm in a happening city is comparable to winning the lottery or any form of luck infact. I'm not saying he should work at Google in Silicon valley or Goldman Sachs in the heart of London. Merely with a B2B provider, somewhere that's not surrounded by tumble weed. You seem extremely down to earth and incredibly capable. Do you take contract work? Is money a driving force for you or job satisfaction? 
Thanks, I’ll check out postgresql as well. 
Why it is not on pypi project page?
Short version: Python does not run in browsers but some special development tools can turn Python into JS which *can* run in the browser. Browsers understand three languages: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Of those three, only the last one is a programming language, similar to Python. HTML is used for structuring content, CSS for layout and visual style and JS for anything dynamic/automated. Typically you end up using all three. On the server side you're basically free to do whatever you want as long as you send things in those three languages at the end. Frameworks in various languages (not just Python) typically offer their own template languages (there are a lot of those…) which will generate HTML to send to the browser. There are also CSS preprocessor languages (most commonly SASS or LESS). And there are some projects that allow you to cross-compile other programming languages into JS. There are projects that do this for Python. Whether or not you want to go that route is your decision. Personally I prefer to just write JS instead, as cross compilation involves some additional overhead. 
The first class is not very useful and features a lot of blabbing about tangential stuff like "what is data science" then "go look on StackOverflow" for how to do the assignments. I learned quicker teaching myself on real world problems I had at work. It is not a good course for learning general Python programming. It's about what I'd expect from a free MOOC.
I'm working on a project that will do this exact thing using GraceNote's API. Rather new to python, but it's going well so far, I have the code that links to GraceNote to find the genre of a given track, next up is connecting to Spotify's API to get a users library. Found two library's that are making things pretty easy: pygn, and spotipy.
Anyone?
So what’s pythons uses in development?just servers? Pythons Django framework is used to make web apps a- wouldn’t that be apart of website creation? Thanks for the info btw. I’m just learning and trying to get the big picture before I delve in. 
Did you try printing pitch to console? I don’t see you catching cases below your min value or above your max value.
No worries I’ve done far worse
It is sort of dumb. But also, I don't like to use _ as a dummy variable name (rather, I go with "dummy") because it overwrites the _() function, which is used to translating strings into foreign languages as part of the gettext module.
 Just finished a weekend project and am now working on refining it / cleaning it up, since it feels like one big messy loop. It scans my Spotify playlists for the artists I listen to, and it searches for new music from them and adds it to the playlist I have for the artist. It’ll also email me an HTML report of all the new tracks/albums it found. So it will run weekly and tell me what’s new. 
/u/gandalfx explained everything pretty well, so if you're still not grasping, you should head over to /r/learnprogramming or /r/learnpython (you should go there anyway, they're both great subs) and ask for more info. But just as a quick extension/clarification to his answer: yes, Python is only used on the server.
Python would be used for back end and html, css, and js would be used for front end.

Yaaaaaaaaay, I finally found a way to really easily serialise models to JSON, by simply implement to\_dict method that returns your model as a dict, yes it should be done manually, but it is very easy to deal with when you are developing a complicated APIs and you need a dirty way to return your models as quickly as you could. Thanks again and again Z4578a for you’re the great job. Here is an example: from datetime import datetime from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy db = SQLAlchemy() class Survey(db.Model): __tablename__ = 'surveys' id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True) name = db.Column(db.Text) created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow) questions = db.relationship('Question', backref="survey", lazy=False) def to_dict(self): return dict(id=self.id, name=self.name, created_at=self.created_at.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'), questions=[question.to_dict() for question in self.questions]) class Question(db.Model): __tablename__ = 'questions' id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True) text = db.Column(db.String(500), nullable=False) created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow) survey_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('surveys.id')) choices = db.relationship('Choice', backref='question', lazy=False) def to_dict(self): return dict(id=self.id, text=self.text, created_at=self.created_at.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'), survey_id=self.survey_id, choices=[choice.to_dict() for choice in self.choices]) class Choice(db.Model): __tablename__ = 'choices' id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True) text = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False) selected = db.Column(db.Integer, default=0) created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow) question_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('questions.id')) def to_dict(self): return dict(id=self.id, text=self.text, created_at=self.created_at.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'), question_id=self.question_id) Then you simply query that like so: @api.route('/surveys/') def surveys(): surveys = Survey.query.all() return jsonify({ 'surveys': [s.to_dict() for s in surveys] }) I found this method in this article, I tried it and it worked very well for me. [http://stackabuse.com/single\-page\-apps\-with\-vue\-js\-and\-flask\-restful\-api\-with\-flask/](http://stackabuse.com/single-page-apps-with-vue-js-and-flask-restful-api-with-flask/)
Yea but java and C++ is a lot more difficult to learn no?
But the learning curve tho..
Atom was nice, but so annoyingly slow. Using Sublime Text for small things myself.
How come you are building this on \`Windows 10\`. Building something this complex on Windows must be a nightmare..
\+1 Would love to read it..
I’m not at the point of processing speed yet so maybe once I get there I might switch over 
What are you planning in the sequel to \`Automate the Boring Stuff\` Book? That was pretty cool btw.. I pickup something or the other frequently..

That's kind of where Fluent Python and Effective Python pick up. also a good read are: 'Foundations for Analytics With Python', 'Functional Python Programming', 'High Performance Python'. There are others which are more specific to a particular field (Data Science, Financials, Web etc) which add a spin to what you'v learned so they are worth the look IMO
story time?
This seem very unsafe. 
Employers also look for skills in the operationalization side of things. I'd recommend looking to architect some app or scraper type thing using all (or a bunch of) the free tier AWS features. You could easily write some server-less lambda based API in python, or maybe deploy a Django or Tornado app on ECS. These will be valuable skills to go with your Python chops.
Try /r/learnpython. Show them what you have tried and describe where you are stuck. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
Okay thanks man
FWIW we plan to implement some of amazing Trio's ideas in asyncio 3.8.
Mind elaborating a bit more I’m still kinda a newbie. 
People in python specialize even more such as data, web development, machine learning, etc. Your looking at web development. Therefore you want to use flask or django. Django is more common in the tech world, but flask is more fun and easy. Get some tutorials on youtube on flask or django. Im not exactly sure what you mean by website monitor. If you mean scraper, you should look at selenium videos. 
Would you share it with me also? Thanks 
Google. 
They probably mean [this] (https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/08/03/bad_algorithm_lost_440_million_dollars/) 
I wish everyone would stop answers like these there’s so much info it’s hard to determine what’s pertinent or beneficial to what ur trying to do. 
What's not beneficial is people thinking they can get a five minute answer to a 200 hour question. 
I really don’t get the hostility. Lol Idk where to go I just needed a bit of direction if u have an issue u don’t have to help but don’t shame me for not knowing or lacking some knowledge. “Google” isn’t a helpful helpful answer in some cases all I’m saying. 
Thank you. 
It's the most helpful answer you'll ever receive. I'm not being hostile *I'm trying to help.* Learn Django Google that. 
Zeep is a soap library that has helper functions to convert soap returns (usually xml) to native python objects. You could try to use those helper functions
I read your post and see you're trying to go the other direction...
And again the hostility is unnecessary and toxic. I’ve googled sneaker bots and shit countless times much of the stuff is dated or is non existent but again. If ur on here to curse me out and tell me to google u can get the hell off my post😂. 
Sure they are cheaper? Google give 25k views for free and looks like mapbox does 50k per month for free. Also looks like a intranet site requires a seat license per end user 
Yes, that's right. Python is used for server side development. Django is a web development framework where you use python for server side tasks and but again here you will be using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for serving that data on the browser. Django just makes this easier to do with some built in features. 
Thanks for this comprehensive review.
&gt; I wouldn't call it minority Its a minority. Much like any community, the people who "give a shit" are a small fraction of the community at large.
XML to Python object? *Jarring chord* Amongst our exploitable security vulnerabilities are the billion laughs attack, quadratic blowup, external entity expansion, DTD retrieval and almost fanatical devotion to overly complex, overspecified, structurally redundant markup because Microsoft said it was cool in 1998. Have you considered JSON? If you must, use defusedxml, and defusedxml shall be the library you use.
This belongs in /r/learnpython

I've been working on an app to download calendar files from some local events sites and parse them for events I'd be interested in ... hoping to eventually turn it into an Alexa skill or something. Only issue is that none of the data is consistent so dealing with that is a huge pain :(
This is why you include a debug switch that logs instead of actually doing the thing. 
It covers some intermediate/advanced Python stuff, similar to Effective Python or Fluent Python (but to a much less degree), and then goes into using Flask not to make web apps, but make desktop apps that use the browser as the GUI. Sort of an "offline web app". I didn't want to teach a GUI toolkit like Qt since it wouldn't be as transferrable of a skill as HTML/CSS.
Now, this may be annoying to hear at this point, but have you considered doing this in some other way? Generally speaking using a library to execute commands over SSH already produces a wide array of attack vectors, but you're freely giving authentication information such that it can do a nice clean `sudo rm -rf /*`
I am not expert in this area, but dont you normally use RSA keys? If I remember, fabric can get path to your local public key, so you dont send password.
I’m not sure the exact details as I didn’t do the evaluation but that’s what I was told. We started using map box because it was slightly cheaper and because it turns out that google requires you to delete any stored data retrieved from the maps api if you ever wish to no longer use their service. Map box doesn’t and I believe that was the main motivator behind the decision.
I deployed discourse which I think is best for a discussion community and still running that community today also. But, reddit has the option of creating sub-reddit which is really important and best things is all posts are only seeing able in own sub-reddits not on homepage unless someone subscribe.
Fair point, I was just thinking about how costly a simple map widget could become on an internal website. Besides just paying for a seat for every employee that might load the page, not sure how you could even guarantee compliance if there isn't an auth gate. Seat licensing generic JavaScript widgets like this just seems like an audit trap 
&gt; First, I want my development environment to be in linux. Since my server will be linux, I don't want to have to deal with differences causing problems between OS. I tried this myself, but at the end I found it isn't worth all the hassle. I now normally develop on Windows and then deploy to linux via github. For me the main issue was, that as a longterm windows user, I already have learned all the tools like Total commander, Notepad++, HeidiSQL, Greenshot, or even MS Office. You will spend a lot of time to find decent Linux alternatives, learn all the shortcuts, etc. If I would be you, I would also check first if you will indeed be coding "on a small laptop somewhere", if it's practical. I work from home so I could be coding from anywhere theoretically, but in real practice, I only ever code at home... sitting with my big keyboard, staring at my big monitor. :-)
I'm not a Python specific Developer, but I use Python a lot in my work. I'm going to list all the tools I use just because. * OS: Ubuntu, ParrotSec (like Kali with some extra tools built in) * IDE/Editor: Sublime Text, vim, Pycharm, Eclipse. * DBMS: PostgreSQL. * CMS: Wordpress * Languages: Ruby, Python, JavaScript, Java * Frameworks: Ruby on Rails, Flask, Node.js, Android, React.js, Redux, Ember.js * Other tools: git, webpack, gulp, nginx, Apache, Ansible, Gitlab, Google Cloud, AWS. 
PyCharm, with virtualenv to keep versions/pip-dependencies separate between projects. Also Docker if the project has other special needs. I develop on both Linux and Windows, and the main "gotcha" is that Windows has some issues with sharing the source directory in the development docker container, necessitating some workarounds.
As I said, Python 3 has improvements with unicode in general, but also inputting and outputting non ascii characters on the windows console in particular. I wouldn't bother trying to "fix" any issues if they are specific to python 2.7, and have (probably) already been fixed in 3.6
A car analogy.. The engine, wheels, that sort of stuff - that's python. The steering wheel, radio, brake pedals, shiny chrome cup holder.. That's html/css/javascript.
Well I'm a just starting out learning python, and it surely helped comprehending classes, so thank you
I mostly use vim and related tools for writing code, and occasionally PyCharm for major debugging or refactoring sessions. For some more data-sciency things I use jupyter notebooks, either locally or hosted on one of our servers.
Most books only cover the basics of a programming language. You learn the language as a tool, and what you use it for is up to you. Competitive programming is one of the things you can do, but it is not what everyone is up to. Therefore it is not covered everywhere. The question boils down to "How do I become a better programmer?" Technical stuff like reading from a website can be googled, but there is no absolute guide at becoming a better programmer. No book can teach you that, only practice. Challenge yourself, try some things. Look at other people's code. Try to understand why they do what they do. Hope that helps! :) 
Thanks bro!
This is the reason why I follow this subreddit
Learning pyspark for grouping Movies 
This is better but still very statefull, with state passing underwater between method calls.
This is more JS than Python. Also if you stack leaflet on it then its pretty much 5 lines of JS.
At least double if you have the memory, and still use python threading for IO where possible.
dudeguy This is how it works: browser makes a request server responds by sending a text file. browser displays the text file as a webpage. text file written in html, css and javascript. html gives the structure css gives the appearance javascript makes page interactive (i.e can do things such as respond to a button) server is programmed:python is one of several possible languages. so:html, css, javascript =&gt;front end python =&gt; possible choice for backend language. 
What do you mean by *competitive programming*? I used to be a competitive programmer when I was in high school, but the problems were about maths and algorithms (like on ACM-ICPC, Google Code Jam, etc), reading websites was never required.
&gt;No book can teach you that, only practice. Challenge yourself, try some things. Look at other people's code. Try to understand why they do what they do. So much this. If you ever come across a thing that you want to do that *should* be simple (like reading or writing to a CSV file, matrix operations, etc), always try to do it yourself at least once. Then, if it's really cumbersome to do or needs to be optimized more, hit up a library someone else wrote. Another thing you might want to try is branching out to different styles of programming. Functional programming is pretty cool, and so is object oriented programming. Try to make yourself code a few problems in one particular style, so you get an idea of where each excels and where each is weak. Then mix them to take advantage on their respective strengths. Also, using different languages is another great thing you could try out. Especially lower-level languages like C or FORTRAN, which force you to do a lot of the minutia that Python manages and abstracts for you. Even if you don't use it day-to-day, it still teaches you what's going on with your computer.
This is really cool, but the video goes dark after your cut around the 20 second mark.

This was not my personal choice. To be honest, I would not even serialize as a human readable object. But I am currently implementing a challenge, and it asked to convert object to xml and then xml to object back. Thanks for the post!
I will probably be downvoted for this but note it doesn't always work perfectly. I \*think\* it should be fine for your apps if they aren't too complex though.
You know there’s a “save post” button, right?
Wouldn't it just be easier to make a "jump window" that slides across the screen and then is brute force optimized to eliminate obstacles? Using a nnet seems like overkill here, but for an abstract HowTo I understand the intention.
Look more into graph theory, lot of algorithms can ne applied there. Or look specifficaly for lot or algorithms in image processing, path finding etc...

In this game the dino speeds up with time, so i think that saving a time stamp with each frame could improve the performance. My question is how would a cnn handle it? Could you just skip the cnn layer and add that data in the dense layer?
I just discovered this, using it on Mac. Absolutely love it. 
Yeah. What's nice about artifactory is that it supports multiple package types (Java javascript, Ruby, docker, etc) and it can act as both private store and transparent caching proxy to external repos - if you set up what they call a virtual repo it can act as both simultaneously.

I'm thrilled ! Asyncio error propagation and ctrl + C handling have been my nightmare. As a dev, if I end up on an asyncio project, I spend half of my time coding around the design of asyncio: dealing with people switching loops or loop policy, making error more apparent (or debugging silenced error for real fun), ensuring people pass awaitable where it's due, etc. It's time I'd prefer spend on solving my problem. As a teacher, I just gave up on explaining asyncio beginers. I file it under "very advanced Python". It's a shame because JS dev start from day one with async without any problems. So you are quite litterally making my day. Is there a bug ticket or mailing list thread I can follow about this ? I love you :-*

This week I'm working on aggregating daily article view stats so that users can see how many views an article has had each day for the last 30 days. I'm also working on an improved news feed to show case more content from programmers who write on Able instead of just pulling in content from Hacker News, Reddit and Medium / tech blogs from Netflix, Uber, Dropbox, Instagram etc. Would love to get some feedback from the community if anyone has time to take a look.

More specifically, I was thinking of this change: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0528/ Now, your program as written above contains a bug. You're writing the UTF-8 encoded *bytes* to stdout, instead of the unicode string itself. But anyway, I just tried directly doing ``print(text)`` on windows 10 default console myself and it shows placeholder characters. I suppose this is a font issue. But yeah, when using a *proper* console such as ConEmu, it works without issues. 
With Flask you can create much more lightweight API solutions compared to Django \(e.g. with addition of the Django REST framework\). I'm saying that as a regular Django user having both solutions in active deployment.
Was flask or django too slow for you? Django + drf is a solid choice and it's very well supported.

SerpentAI actually came to mind while I was making this! I haven’t gone into it enough yet but I will definitely take another look.
The idea is generality and automation. Brute force would be a solution specific to this problem requiring engineer time to implement. The benefit of the ANN is that it can perform without domain specific knowledge automatically. It's about saving human time, and developing solutions that are domain in-specific.

Glad I could help! Is there anything in the article that is unclear, or are there still some questions you have about classes and objects?
I implemented several services with Flask and the experience was good. You need to know how many requests will you handle approximately... normally in production environment you will deploy flask application behind uWSGI service, which will be behind nginx. That is quite a robust solution. By security, that depends what you mean by it. Your API can be behind https, and for authorization, you will need to use some flask module for it, or implemented it yourself by using tokens, for example.

Anaconda with WingIDE. I only use virtual environments when a program has an overly strict set of requirements and I don't want to fix it.
Start off with basic manipulations first? Questions like: How to print a string, how to print a random number, how to print 100 of the same numbers etc. Then move on to more complex questions like how to read a string and do pronic numbers, find pairs, change date format, etc. Then move on to data structures and how to use them. Then move on to functions. Then object-oriented programming. Teach him to make a simple Snake or Battleship game using OOP concepts. Then after that, if he's still interested, he should be able to self-learn anything else.
Well, it is an interesting Python task, but are you sure you need to do anything at all? True ANSI is a subset of UTF-8, so the result should be identical to your original zip files.

I recently bought a new 6th-gen iPad with LTE, and am very happy with it as a dev machine. I use MOSH with Blink to connect to a Linux box hosted on Digital Ocean. [Here's a picture of my setup](https://i.imgur.com/cXYaBOq.jpg). Blink is a great app, and MOSH is what makes it so special. SSH requires every character you type and every character that's output by the shell to be transferred between the server and client. MOSH is a protocol that sits on top of SSH, and keeps a remote cache of the shell's state at any given time. Instead of sending every character, it sends diffs. That means the connection stays persistent even when you're not actively using the app. It also anticipates the shell's echo, so you're not waiting for it to round-trip to the server every time you type a character before it displays. Links: * [Blink](http://blink.sh) * [6th-gen iPad, 128GB, LTE](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-9-7/128gb-space-gray-wifi-cellular) * [DareU EK820 keyboard](https://flashquark.com/product/dareu-ek820-bluetooth-68-key-mechanical-keyboard-wkailh-low-profile-switches/) One thing I didn't realize was that the iPad Pro has a keyboard connector on one side and supports Apple's keyboard cover; the iPad doesn't. I wanted a mechanical anyhow for "real" work, but YMMV. I also really like my keyboard. It's "clicky", but uses Kailh low-profile switches. There are only a couple of keyboards out there at the moment that I've found that use those, and the keycaps are proprietary, but it's about half the thickness of comparable mechanical keyboards and the key travel is much shorter. I sold my personal MBP in favor of this setup and have been entirely satisfied with it. At this point I don't even own a laptop of my own and have no desire to buy one. I have a 13" MBP for work if I ever find something that I really *need* a laptop for, but in the three months I've had this setup I've not needed it once. in fact, I recently attended PyCon and didn't take a personal laptop at all; all of my coding was done on the iPad.
Yes, because my end goal is to ingest this data into Splunk. Currently, the data is being ignored because Splunk sees it as binary. When I open the files in Notepad then manually change the encoding to UTF-8, from ANSI, Splunk will ingest the files properly. I'm looking for a way to automate this process, as drilling down and changing the encoding on hundreds of files in dozens of directories is a bit tedious.

Question motivated learning is about giving just the right amount of tools/knowledge to the learner, and letting him/her complete the rest. Like for example, you can teach a beginner how to do substrings, then give him a problem where he has to determine if a string is a palindrome. This will test his willpower and desire to learn.
Here is a link to an example I created from your code: [https://pastebin.com/xwjWxHXn](https://pastebin.com/xwjWxHXn) You should consider making the format of your code look as "clean" as possible to make it more likely someone who is trying to help you will read it. It's sometimes easier to use an external site like pastebin to link you code as it should keep the format intact. You have used recursion in your original example in a manner that is unnecessary. I have create a new example based on your code which uses a "while" loop to make the program repeat it's calculation. \(The program will stop when only enter is pressed for age or name\). 
&gt; "Censor your opinions about topics relevant to the subreddit" - yes, would clearly be oppressive. Is PEP 20 oppressive? &gt; "Don't be mean and bigoted while we try to begin repairing the tremendous damage we've already done by scaring away vast swathes of all the regular, emotional &amp; vulnerable human beings" It's not at all clear to me that *we* have done any damage (let alone *tremendous* damage) to, or scared away, anyone. If your participation is motivated by guilt because historically you have been a giant asshole, maybe you should stop hiding behind this "we" obfuscation and take responsibility for your actions and choices. This being Reddit, it's really easy to edit the things you said before that you think were over the line, change/remove them, and add a note that you've revised your earlier comments and regret your behavior. You could even message the people you've tremendously damaged and apologize, and offer to help them. If you don't actually mean to say that *you* have been doing tremendous damage, but you're just using "we" (with a wink to suggest that *you're* certainly not one of the bad ones) to accuse other people of being horrible, maybe a first step towards ending the awfulness would be honesty - if you think some other person is an asshole, just say so. We don't need to hide behind a bunch of rules, or outsource assertiveness to other people who will wield power on behalf of unnamed, unidentified victims of unspecified and unknowable injuries.

I use pycharm for all my development work. It's code inspection is fantastic and really helps me understand other people's code. I do have sublime for quick fixes and vim when I'm on servers. Running OS X for Dec, Linux for prod. I'm in data science so I'm pretty lazy about my pip and venv. I tend to use pip latest and that almost always works since mathy code rarely ever changes.
One nitpick - I don’t know that it’s preferred to use short names for methods/variables when writing code. I would argue that all (or almost all) methods and variables should be descriptive and precise.

Good decision! There’s no one “right” path. A lot depends on your time and financial resources. I started my career as an actuary, but spent a lot of my downtime learning programming, and now I’m a software engineer with some experience in machine learning. I learned most of what I know through work experience and online resources. I’ll share what has helped me: There are several free or cheap courses online to help you get started. [Udacity](www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120) offers a free introductory video-based course. It recommends a basic understanding of linear algebra and statistics as prerequisites. If you prefer a textbook, [Python Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Machine-Learning-scikit-learn-TensorFlow/dp/1787125939/ref=nodl_) was very helpful to me. Getting started, IMO, I don’t think it’s necessarily important to understand all of the math that’s included in the book, but it certainly doesn’t hurt. [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com) is a great resource. You can practice your skills on real data sets that you find interesting. There are some tutorials included, and you can see how more experienced engineers approach problems. Try to develop an understanding of fundamental statistical principles. Understanding basic linear regression is a good starting point. I have a degree in statistics, so I had a bit of a head start here. Udacity also has intro stats courses that are free. If you have the time, money, and desire, look into a university education in math, statistics, or machine learning. It’s great that you enjoy programming, because you will definitely spend a lot of your time doing just that. I highly recommend learning Python — it’s extremely popular for machine learning/data science. If you do decide to learn Python, check out [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org), and [numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/). These libraries are extremely useful for introductory machine learning. Sklearn has built-in support for lots of algorithms. Pandas and numpy are extremely useful for data wrangling/cleaning (which is a critical, if mundane, component of machine learning). Spark is also a very useful technology for Big Data, but that may be beyond the scope of getting started in machine learning. I’d be happy to think of some more resources if you’re interested. 
I'm learning Python right now &amp; I'm following the book 'Python Crash Course.' It's awesome, and gives a lot of project exercises and examples.

We have [a pretty long list of learning resources in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index#wiki_new_to_programming.3F). Try a few and see what resonates. Also, if you don't have one already make sure you look for a project that interests you and start on it as soon as you can. Programming is a lot more fun if you have a goal. Come visit us in /r/learnpython if you get stuck. 
Just be careful if you want to develop a commercial app and compile your sourcecode with cython or nuitka because it doesn't work well with threads yet.
Also `nose` and `pylint`. 
There is 2 ways to do it. And to the people who say this is unsafe, fabric is used in hosting companies to run automated commands on thousands of machines. Plus in this case all other measures have been taken for security, I cant talk about what it is being used for because I am under NDA. You can do it with rsa keys or with a password, but even then, I cant figure out how to set it up since fabric 2.0 came out. 
Just use django plus rest. That way you get a free admin interface as well as a ORM. So easy
Yeah I have no idea why the devs did what they did, they effed up some stuff that used to be super simple. Seems really counter intuitive to me.
Thanks. Can you provide a little bit more context for this. I have an IT background and have been working with websites for a few years and have been studying python for 2 \- 3 months. I have been hearing about Django and would like to try it out in another month or so. Can you recommend and good free beginner tutorials? If any paid courses or books are good I would like to hear about those also.
 if all([condition_obj1, condition_obj2, condition_obj3]): # run some code But it's probably better to call the is_complete() method as a generator: objects = [obj1, obj2, obj3] if all(obj.is_complete() for obj in objects): # run some code That way it will "short-circuit" when the first object returns False.

How long have you been working on this and are you doing this all by yourself? Looking good man! Is it Django you're using? Keep it up! This looks promising!
Yes! That is amazing! When will it be out? You killed it in the first book. For some reason that book clicked with me so much better than others.
I mean why this info is not availible on pypi? Maybe you can contribute this feature to pypi? As it was at some point, when there were download counters for day, week and month.

Then you might want to look into `asyncio`. For example, you could do future1 = webscrape("https://www.reddit.com/r/Python") future2 = webscrape("https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruby") result1, result2 = asyncio.gather(future1, future2)
Thanks for the reply, I was hopping maybe a SSH guide because hostgator doesn't have an option for Python applications only Ruby on rails. The server has python, pip and virtualenv installed. 
If you have SSH access then you should be able to just follow a "normal" guide for installing Flask on a server, right? 
Try r/learnpython This is for python related news and articles.
If you want you can use the 'property' built-in class/functions. Each class attribute has a "private" attribute prefixed with an underscore, and a "public" without prefix. The public attributes are actually implemented through @property, get/set/delete decorated methods, which operate on the private attributes. So "class.attr = 1" actually results in "class._attr = 1". Then the setter function just raises an exception - and the result is an "immutable" attribute, that could only be set during class initialisation (the init method). It's possible to also use immutable types, but it becomes difficult to comprehend if you end up with many large groups of values. collections.NamedTuple can help readability there, as can use of typing hints.
Because is a shared hosting, I don’t have permissions for installing packages in the server neither manage the apache config files
Oh.... I guess that's technically SSH access, but not really. Have you tried reaching out to the support team and seeing if they have a way to help you out with this.
At work I've setup Artifactory to make a local pypi repository \(which caches the real one\). This is good I guess, because we run a lot of Jenkins jobs which run tox and in that way creates a ton of new virtual environments and pip install hundreds of packages every day. But in other companies, if you are not using Artifactory, how do you deal with these repetitive mass\-pip\-install tasks in order to not overwhelm pypi?
A step further would be to create a class object that implements dunder methods: + object.__add__(self, other) - object.__sub__(self, other) * object.__mul__(self, other) // object.__floordiv__(self, other) / object.__truediv__(self, other) % object.__mod__(self, other) ** object.__pow__(self, other[, modulo]) &lt;&lt; object.__lshift__(self, other) &gt;&gt; object.__rshift__(self, other) &amp; object.__and__(self, other) ^ object.__xor__(self, other) | object.__or__(self, other) https://www.python-course.eu/python3_magic_methods.php This way, OP can invent his own set of comparison. People often overload the | or // or / to generate a DSL for objects.
Looks interesting? Care to compare it with existing solutions for this, like snakemake, airflow, luigi, celery or nextflow?
I didn't say anything about the licensing, just that if you compile your app and use threads you will have issues using pyside2. Licensing is better for pyside2 as you don't have to pay for a license but certain apps won't work\(or atleast my threaded app didnt work\).
Could someone kindly explain how this network is trained? When you feed it raw image data and the associated action, how specifically are the weights adjusted? Maybe I’m just confused what the weights are connected to. Thanks! 
Oh...usually that's why open source people steer clear of PyQt...I wasn't aware that threads don't work correctly in PySide2. Is that a known bug?
asyncio looks quite cool, but the point of a DSL (in my case) is to expose my own customized API. Maybe I can encapsulate gather, but await seems to be a keyword?
&gt; However, Python doesn't seem to have any concept of blocks and the lambdas don't want to span multiple lines. I get the impression this is kind of by design. You are forced to use a `def` if your function is complicated. This might make creating these sort of "Internal DSLs" less powerful. For this particular case, you might might want to use decorators: @given(condition) def f(): blah You can then chain these decorators, albeit in the wrong order: @given(second) @given(first) def name(): blah You could do some evil magic whereby you build an object with `__call__` if you wanted to switch up this order but this violates the principle of least surprise. "dot-chaining" in the style of jquery selectors is a common approach for python DSLs. See for example the Django ORM internal DSL. This might how you end up writing your DSL @if(first).if(second) def name(): blah If I was writing this then I'd actually be more inclined to use a decorator to create an object with doted methods @thunk def name() blah name.given(first).given(second) 
Call is synchronous and so your script will pause until the program to call completes. Your process is behaving correctly. You may be better taking a look at popen which is asynchronous and lets to feed data into stdin and get a response out of stdout which will also give you an opportunity to log everything.
again. i haven't said it doesn't work well with threads, only that if you compile it it doesn't work well with threads.

look up Selenium. it's a module with which you can automate a browser like Chrome to open websites and search for stuff. but, searching for elements is specific for each site \- you have to search by xpath, id, class name...

vscode + several extensions on macOS with many Python-based linting and testing tools
Looking at a few examples that seems good. Is there an Excel module?
Honestly this is one of the worts reasoning for using properties. Yes you can do use properties to mimic getters and setters but this is in almost all cases unnecessary. I see this often from peoples with a java background. Properties are there for calculated attributes, not for try to implement private/public behaivor, because everything is public in python objects anyways. So rebuild immutable objects with properties is very wrong in my optinion, especially when you have already good immutable builtins and more in the std lib: Tuples, frozensets, the before rightfully mentioned namedtuples and soon possible immutable dataclasses. Attrs is also a good third party supplement.
Automated, for me, a bunch of domain name related lookups (whois, IP address, web site redirects..) that I do often at work... just finished a version I am happy with yesterday!
I've been working on something similar recently.. this will look for the word python on either site. It will not search across the whole site, just the homepage. You'll need some spider function to do that! import requests from requests_html import HTMLSession domain_list = ['reddit.com','python.org'] session = HTMLSession() for domain in domain_list: url = 'http://' + domain try: r = session.get(url, timeout=10) if r.html.search('Python'): print('Found the word python in ' + domain) except Exception: print('Error: ' + str(domain + ' ' + url)) 
Awesome, thank you!
\&gt; **I tried to build it immutably, passing the state around through functions.** Any reason for this? Usually a class that manage the state of a game is a better approach. \&gt; **I am building this little exploratory program**: [https://github.com/jared\-ross/egyptian\-rafter](https://github.com/jared-ross/egyptian-rafter) The usage of \`global\` already looks like you just want to have a class instead of forcing yourself to be pure functional. Also, using globals is also not very "pure". Also, I don't get the overuse of closures in your example. \&gt; I would like to know what you guys think, **is there something I have missed**, some "Python Way of Doing Things" I am missing out on. Or is this what is expected. This looks very unpythonic to me, besides the pep8 violations I can overlook, structure\-wise it is right now a mess in many ways. Python is a multi\-paradigm language, you are not forced to use just one programming paradigm, you can switch on appropriate places, I wouldn't force myself to only code functional or OOP. My approach would be a game class that organizes the current state and stuff and a game loop that calls for updates. A card class isn't so usefull, since cards are simple records, so using namendtuples is a good way to have a nice interface with out writing alot of boilerplate. The last time I worked with curses, a custom contextmanager was very very helpful to manage the quite arcane interface of curses, but maybe this is more an advanced topic. \&gt; and I am coming from a functional programming background. Things like generators, itertools is something you should look at, maybe you will see something familiar and maybe you like the style and usage of it. functools and lambdas are not that powerful as their equivalents in other functional languages. Some pythonists would say, using lambdas, or better the overuse, is a sign of bad style, but that is debatable. Here an example how I would write the deck creation logic with itertools, list comprehension and extended unpacking, just as a little showcase: In \[1\]: from collections import namedtuple In \[2\]: Card = namedtuple\('Card', 'rank suit'\) In \[3\]: from itertools import product In \[4\]: deck = list\(product\(list\(range\(1, 11\)\) \+ list\('JQKA'\), 'SCDH'\)\) In \[5\]: deck Out\[5\]: \[\(1, 'S'\), \(1, 'C'\), \(1, 'D'\), \(1, 'H'\), \(2, 'S'\), \(2, 'C'\), \(2, 'D'\), \(2, 'H'\), \(3, 'S'\), \(3, 'C'\), \(3, 'D'\), \(3, 'H'\), \(4, 'S'\), \(4, 'C'\), \(4, 'D'\), \(4, 'H'\), \(5, 'S'\), \(5, 'C'\), \(5, 'D'\), \(5, 'H'\), \(6, 'S'\), \(6, 'C'\), \(6, 'D'\), \(6, 'H'\), \(7, 'S'\), \(7, 'C'\), \(7, 'D'\), \(7, 'H'\), \(8, 'S'\), \(8, 'C'\), \(8, 'D'\), \(8, 'H'\), \(9, 'S'\), \(9, 'C'\), \(9, 'D'\), \(9, 'H'\), \(10, 'S'\), \(10, 'C'\), \(10, 'D'\), \(10, 'H'\), \('J', 'S'\), \('J', 'C'\), \('J', 'D'\), \('J', 'H'\), \('Q', 'S'\), \('Q', 'C'\), \('Q', 'D'\), \('Q', 'H'\), \('K', 'S'\), \('K', 'C'\), \('K', 'D'\), \('K', 'H'\), \('A', 'S'\), \('A', 'C'\), \('A', 'D'\), \('A', 'H'\)\] In \[6\]: deck = \[Card\(rank, suit\) for rank, suit in product\(list\(range\(1, 11\)\) \+ list\('JQKA'\), 'SCDH'\)\] In \[7\]: deck\[:4\] Out\[7\]: \[Card\(rank=1, suit='S'\), Card\(rank=1, suit='C'\), Card\(rank=1, suit='D'\), Card\(rank=1, suit='H'\)\] In \[8\]: first, \*deck = deck In \[9\]: first Out\[9\]: Card\(rank=1, suit='S'\) In \[10\]: first.rank Out\[10\]: 1 In \[11\]: first.suit Out\[11\]: 'S' In \[12\]: first, \*deck = deck In \[13\]: first.rank Out\[13\]: 1 In \[14\]: first.suit Out\[14\]: 'C'

I wrote à package for 1d transient pde solving that is pip installable and rely on theano to speed up the computation. You can find it at locie.github.io/triflow It use simple finite difference with high order implicit temporal scheme. 
Dear gods, no. There's already too many useless shitposting bots here.
Find something you like. Automate something that you're now doing manually. Recreate your favourite commandline tool. r/learnprogramming has a list of projects in the sidebar, I think. https://github.com/karan/Projects has some things you can implement, too.
You're welcome! If you figure out a nice and simple spider using requests i'd love to hear about it.. it's further down on my list of things to learn :-)
&gt; Is there a bug ticket or mailing list thread I can follow about this ? Not yet. I plan to implement Trio's nurseries and cancel scopes as a third-party module (maybe with additional glue code in uvloop) and once it's ready we'll integrate it into asyncio 3.8. We need this for EdgeDB so that should motivate me to do this sooner than later. I'll blog about it, so you guys will know about the progress :) &gt; I love you :-* Aw, thanks for the support! :)
Cool post! Do you know if the video will be made available at some point. It'd be great to see the session. Thanks for putting this together.
 &gt; One thing to keep in mind with groupby() is that it isn’t as smart as you might like. As groupby() traverses the data, it aggregates elements until an element with a different key is encountered, at which point it starts a new group No, it's exactly as smart as it's meant to be, you're just using it in a way it was not intended for. I've seen a lot of Python tutorials use `groupby` like this, and it doesn't help that the name matches the SQL name for a slightly different idiom. `groupby` is intended for processing chunks of sequential data. A simple example is a log file, where you want to perform some operation on the logs for each day. Presuming the data looks like this : - Feb 26 08:32:09: %SEV_5: Something happened here ... Feb 26 13:04:35: %SEV_2: Something else happened ... ... Feb 27 ... and so on, then you could group together the logs for each day like so: with open('logs') as f: for day, logs in groupby(f.readlines(), lambda line: line[:6]): # do stuff... Now `day` holds some string value like `Feb 27`, and `logs` is an iterator of all the log entries from that day. The whole point of starting a new group when a different key is encountered is to chunk data together in this manner, which is particularly useful when processing large volumes of data efficiently. For such a small amount of data, what the author wants is a different idiom. To use a Perl 6 name, he wants to "classify" the data... my @data = { name =&gt; 'Allen', age =&gt; 34 }, { name =&gt; 'Betsy', age =&gt; 29 }, { name =&gt; 'Cathy', age =&gt; 34 }, { name =&gt; 'David', age =&gt; 33 }; .say for @data.classify(*&lt;age&gt;); =output 33 =&gt; [{age =&gt; 33, name =&gt; David}] 29 =&gt; [{age =&gt; 29, name =&gt; Betsy}] 34 =&gt; [{age =&gt; 34, name =&gt; Allen} {age =&gt; 34, name =&gt; Cathy}] To classify all the data it can't do this "in parts", so it doesn't, and there's no need to pre-sort. The author's solution is to create a convenience function that sorts the data by the same key as `groupby`, but in using it for this purpose, he doesn't need what `groupby` offers and he may as well create a different convenience function use a `defaultdict(list)`. def classify(items, key): d = defaultdict(list) for x in items: d[key(x)].append(x) return dict(d) data = [{'name': 'Allen', 'age': 34}, {'name': 'Betsy', 'age': 29}, {'name': 'Cathy', 'age': 34}, {'name': 'David', 'age': 33}] grouped_data = classify(data, key=lambda x: x['age']) It's slightly more verbose, but it's a better fit for this operation... but (don't take my word for it](https://speakerdeck.com/pyconslides/transforming-code-into-beautiful-idiomatic-python-by-raymond-hettinger-1?slide=18).

I’ve actually found it easier to make web apps using flask whenever I wanted a GUI for something. Learning how to do it though HTML,css, and JavaScript will probably be more beneficial overall compared to learning a specific GUI package.
Continuum/Anaconda might get you closer.
This example is pretty close to hello world for end to end behavior cloning. But make the game a little more complicated \- such as by adding more player output options, more hazard types, platforms, a 3rd dimension \- And the jump window stops working while behavior cloning still works \(albeit requiring a larger amount of training data\).
I feel your pain. I’m not here to help you, sorry, since I jumped ship from Anaconda last winter after months of it breaking everything. I hope you too find peace.
Well, at least that gives me a conclusive answer. Shoulda probably mentioned that I'm a beginner... Any recommendations?

I felt the exact same way I finally decided to learn it. It's like a breath of fresh air. Sadly there are few things in my life that made me feel like this, Python and Bitcoin both give me the same levels of enjoyment. I've used Java, Groovy, Scala, Objective-C, C, C++, C#, Perl and Javascript in a professional capacity over the years and nothing feels as natural to me as Python does. The developers truly deserve any donations they get for making it. Hell my next two planned tattoos are bitcoin and python logos on my wrists. Congrats on taking the time to get into it, BTW the next time you need to investigate data you have to try Jupyter, numpy, pandas and matplotlib, it's like finding Python all over again ;) Have fun mate and welcome to the dark side. 
Enjoying wasting time is not time wasted.
Damn. Surprised I haven't ever heard this before, makes me feel much better about my life. 
I felt the same way when I heard it today. Literally changed my outlook on my life in a minor way.
Ah it looked very similar to the color scheme of my Visual Studio. That explains it then.
Thanks for actually being helpful, will look into it!
Damn. More than I bargained for. I'll keep it in mind. Was recommended these link https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-11 https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computational-thinking-data-mitx-6-00-2x-6 and they suggested Anaconda to install so it might just be that I have no clue about what I'm doing and don't need it in the first place. Figured I'd do everything possible before disregarding it. Oh well. Such is life. I'll find another way. Hopefully this thread can help other n00bs in the same situation. Thank for the help regardless.
I usually cut everything into smaller and smaller BoxLayouts. One box for the whole screen. In that, a box for the left side and a box for the right. On the right side, a box for the tabbed panel and a box below that for the console output. [Here's a quick mockup to help get you started.](https://paste.ee/p/U1Vgb) That's as far as I got in half an hour, and I have to go to bed to get up for work tomorrow.
No problem! Everything I know about programming and data I learned without paying a single dollar. I would really recommend downloading the latest version of python straight from python.org and using the editor IDLE right out of the box. This saves you from all the fuss of Anaconda and can get you straight to coding. I’ve tried so many editors and environments but now I just use plain ‘ol IDLE. This is the exact video I started with: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=N4mEzFDjqtA I’ve learned a lot of python from Derek Banas, sentdex, and Corey Schafer. I would highly discourage you from paying money to learn because it can be a slippery slope, and you will feel jaded because there can be a learning curve to this stuff before you start to see results, and at first you won’t even understand what you can do with programming because it’s overwhelmingly limitless. In fact, the youtuber sentdex has his own story on his channel of why he started programming. He started in real estate, and hired a programmer to create something for him, but they weren’t getting it to do what he wanted it to do so he figured out how to code himself. He really wanted to learn the library Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to do some Natural Language Processing (NLP), and it snowballed from there and he’s a python guru. Start with the basics, first understand what you can do with programming, and then you will identify a project that interests you and everything from there will follow.
Thanks. Docs are always good but I was thinking more along the longs of something that would be like a detailed tutorial example of a project. I found these and I think my first try will be with one of these courses. **Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp | Udemy** [https://www.udemy.com/python\-and\-django\-full\-stack\-web\-developer\-bootcamp/](https://www.udemy.com/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) **The Ultimate Beginner's Guide to Django 1.11 | Udemy** [https://www.udemy.com/the\-ultimate\-beginners\-guide\-to\-django\-python\-web\-dev\-website/](https://www.udemy.com/the-ultimate-beginners-guide-to-django-python-web-dev-website/)

yes I usually favor having explicit serialize methods on classes (or some other kind of serializer/visitor that has specific knowledge of each class).. that way each class determines what it looks like in JSON, rather than getting a generic tool to guess for you.

I'm also currently learning to use kivy and have found the examples in the folder "kivy-examples" very useful, especially the "kivycatalog" and "showcase" examples under "/kivy-examples/demo".

I use python through Anaconda on Windows 10, and those examples are located here: "C:\Users\*User*\Anaconda3\share\kivy-examples

As someone who's been using python for awhile (since Python 2.0). It's really a great language. For a long time I thought it would be the last language I would have to learn, but what's the fun in that? With that said, Python has spoiled me. Every time I write in a different language (for work), I miss the Python philosophy, the zen of Python: import this The only time I wish I used a different language than Python is when I am working on a super large and complex project. A statically typed language (like Java) really feels safer when you're working with layers and layers of other people's code.
&gt; Can I? No, not really. This is not how Python really works in practice. Even tuples are immutable only in first approximation (the public C API includes a procedure `PyTuple_SetItem()` that does what the name suggests). It is not exposed to the Python code, but nobody stops you from writing a dozen lines C extension which will allow you to modify tuples in Python. Obviously, the language documentation will insist on tuples being immutable, but in practical sense... Anyways, there are also few more built-in data-structures like that. There's also an immutable dictionary somewhere. But, really, the existing functionality around them doesn't make them particularly useful. If you try to make something like persistent data structures, the performance cost will be terrible. &gt; Should I? As one famous person put it, who apparently Kant, &gt; ought implies can So, after making some Boolean algebra, you can see that you shouldn't. But, another way to think about it is... Python was designed as a language to make learning to program easier. In the mind of its creator programming was all about writing for-loops and while-loops, declaring variables, modifying values in variables, creating data-structures similar to those you can find in Cormen's textbook. The questions of state management came in later, and they were solved haphazardly several times, every time with only very moderate degree of success. So, that's how Python has objects, `with` and closures, but neither works particularly well. It is a language which appeals to several audiences: ops/administration, scientific programming, tests/automation, some web programming. This is because it is (or used to be) easy to get started and didn't require understanding of complicated CS ideas to achieve some practical goals: one's intuition would be enough. It is easy to write bindings to C, C++, Fortran etc. code. It has already built bindings for code that can do vectorized computations. That's Python's strength. Python is not good for doing your typical type algebra, persistent data structures, even recursion... those things you might have learned in ML or Miranda-style languages aren't really transferable to Python. And not in the least because a typical Python programmer will not recognize them as valid approaches to solving a problem, and will not feel compelled to follow the example. On a related note: if you goal was to show your code to someone else, who might need to assess your coding prowess: not following PEP-8 will rub people the wrong way (your lines are too long, you use camel-case names for procedures etc.) Things like `if (x == 'y'):` might prevent others from taking you seriously, since it looks like a complete beginner's thing to do (the parens around conditions).
Tell me more. How deep?
It doesn't have to post anything...
Try modules beautifilsoup and selenium. It is enough to get most any data from site. 
Why would you need field sizes at all?
Ahhh ok. I don't know exactly why this feature is not implemented on pypi, for what I read about the opened issues there are a lot of things to do before that.
You sure sound like a programmer.
You seem to be good in between the fronts. Tensorflow.js requires attention. A lot.
Nice one :) Might be a plan to specify that the tasks are python. I thought initially this was a clone of that nice windows command shortcut project (that I forget the name of). 
Google is your Form friend...
Strangely enough, so can tensorflow.
How deep does it go?

You could either parse the CSV line by line, deciding how you want to break the fields up, or use a DictReader (part of the standard *csv* package) to put each line’s fields into a Python *dict* object. So ultimately it’s up to you. Limiting the field size (whether by bytes, or characters, or whatever) is a small bit of code. 
I also went with installing "vanilla" python org and then I install packages via pip. Just would like to remark, that on Windows where I am, some advanced math libraries cannot be (easy) installed via pip. I had to download precompiled whl files; maybe Anaconda solves this somehow, but I also had problems with it. 
You just put a smile on my face :-)
As a kid I copied programs out of magazines to run on a ZX Spectrum. For my A-level in Computers Studies I wrote a linked list program in Pascal. My Uni final year had me programming Lagrange equations in Matlab. My first job had an element of programming Z8 micro controllers. Then I was testing mobile phone baseband hardware in C. But I was never a software engineer. Fast forward today, and during the day I write scripts to manipulate spreadsheets and other data forms. But on an evening I’m busy programming in Python for some personal projects, and building robots with my sons controlled with micropython on a weekend. The thing is, I’m addicted to Python like you. It can do practically everything I want and it’s so accessible. 
Thank you for being the voice of reason. It always bothers me when web apps are suggested in every single thread like this one.
Not that strangely : all graph\-based algo optimizer \(so, all the ML framework\) can do that : theano, tensorflow, pytorch... But you have to code the ODE solver by yourself. FiPy is a finite volume framework, so all common PDE terms are implemented.
A Telegram bot. It's fun and \(sometime\) useful :\)

I think he is talking about embedding the server in the project \(can be done with flask\) and using the kivy internal internet browser. So there would be no server cost and only one browser to support. But I'm going the kivy way, I wanted to learn to make real GUI since quite some time.
Thanks! Yes, been building this myself in my spare time with Django for about 8 months now. I just couldn’t bear how crusty and spammy LinkedIn is anymore. It’s taken a lot of work just to get all the base level features done but aiming to start adding some unique / differentiating features soon. The main focus at the moment is giving developers a clean professional profile and tools to write good blog posts to create a more specialised news/learning source. Like Medium but with more granular language and library topics. Currently have some people writing a few posts about Python, Node, AWS Lambda etc. Anyway, thanks for the encouragement! Means a lot.
&gt; I think he is talking about embedding the server in the project (can be done with flask) and using the kivy internal internet browser. embedding a web- server, backend, and frontend inside kivy to avoid learning kivy? that's insane. even electron doesn't package a server (i dont think?) &gt; So there would be no server cost and only one browser to support. thought mitigated to an extent, the complexity is still greater than doing it natively &gt; But I'm going the kivy way, I wanted to learn to make real GUI since quite some time. good on you. interfaces are fun. if you ever decide to move on from python or are just curious some other tools/languages you might find interesting are QT, android, flutter, and spring
&gt; The only time I wish I used a different language than Python is when I am working on a super large and complex project Give Go a look. It's statically typed but its design principles have a lot of overlap with Python.
Did you use 'automate the boring stuff' to learn it? 
&gt;Well, I at least skimmed your post. ;) Hah, thanks! :-) &gt;Glad to see that you are enjoying yourself. That’s really the most important part. I've enjoyed it every time I've dabbled with programming for sure. In an alternate universe I think that's where I was headed for a career, but life pulls to the left a bit sometimes. :-)
&gt; I know you're not a developer but I'm letting you know if you stick to it you can go pretty deep. I do appreciate that, and thanks for the reply generally! I'm pretty happy to see that there are pretty experienced folks who also prefer python - as I said I suspect I'm going to be looking to use it a lot going forward (I've already got some other ideas), and I'm glad to know that it's regarded as so capable.
We use them at my company. I see them as a type of unit tests. Sure with good practices and understanding of the code base seem to offer little; however it's great for new people coming on and changing the code base into unknown. A good engineer can probably do it without the tests/type hints; however with it seems to require a lot less mental power to understand the code; freeing up space to think about the business value itself rather than the code quality.
&gt; I like java Wow did I hate Java. Of all the coursework I ever did in the area of programming, I found Java to be the most convoluted and difficult to understand. I had an easier time with COBOL when I was a teen than I did with Java 20 years later with a lot more general knowledge under my belt. Java actually made me question whether I was somehow much stupider than I believed myself to be since everyone says it's so easy. :-) At NO time have I ever been tempted to throw together a Java project for something I needed to get done. Quick question - Is something like Django or Flask beneficial/required even for simplistic web development with python? My current project does not require a browser interface, but I could see moving that direction with things in the future. Or is the overhead too high for simplistic stuff? You'll notice I don't list web development in my OP. I did cover it in a class years ago, but don't think I got much from it beyond the very basics. :-)
&gt; Congrats on taking the time to get into it, BTW the next time you need to investigate data you have to try Jupyter, numpy, pandas and matplotlib, it's like finding Python all over again ;) Thanks a lot, and I will do!
I see. But seeing the example in the article, you basically need 3.6, is that right?
Seriously this has been a much warmer reception than I expected actually. I'll be a lot more comfortable coming here with questions when I have them then I would at stack overflow for example.
No. You can even use 2.7, though the experience may not be as nice as using 3.6.
can you give more info how to start ? I like programming in python , but so far only used tkinter and i know almost nothing about web development. 
Is there a more modern python web framework than Django?

Well you have a scrapper. Have it scrape news websites for keywords. Then build a Reddit bot that posts to news oriented subs. 
We actually use the type comments approach, just because we still need to support for a year or two Python 2 :-)
Sorry those aren't problems I'm tackling. I'm migrating a bunch of user configuration information between two fundamentally different systems - the first of which has no mechanism for exporting the needed information, and the second of which has no mechanism for *bulk* import of the needed information. In my case, (skipping a lot of background to keep this post short) my initial and largest run is by necessity going to be only partially automated. So part of the user input process is repetitively asking the user (me) to input different bits of data - though this is still going to be much faster than using the GUI for the system I'm importing to, due to the volume of data in the first pass, and some inefficiencies in the GUI. If I create a .csv to input for the first batch of data, I'm just going to be manually typing in most of the data to the .csv first anyway (not even copy paste), so I figure why not just accept it as user input. But for future batches of new data, which will be much smaller, I can just make the people who are giving me the batch fill out a spreadsheet, which I can directly import with my tool. So the program first needs to determine whether I want to feed it a .csv or manually enter the data, then get all the data one way or the other, and spit out a json file for the new system to suck up. I'm also considering seeing how hard it is to have it call the cli interface to the destination system - having it send the user data that way might possibly be better than json in the end. I'm also considering trying to write it to take part of the data for each user via .csv, then taking user input for the rest - the source system *can* export a small fraction of the data, just not the important bits. How many of these "ifs" and options I actually include in the end will depend a lot on how big the unexpected hurdles I'll surely hit turn out to be. :-) So if any of that sounds similar to what you are trying to do I'd be happy to help, but I think I'm in a pretty niche situation. 
:-D
Attribute errors are generally type errors in disguise, espacially with callable returning None. I use mypy by default on my IDE now, but I only hint my functions on big projects.
&gt; As a kid I copied programs out of magazines to run on a ZX Spectrum. Hah, I remember those days. For me it was a C64 - one little mistake and it was hours of work to find the typo since early on I had NO idea what I was doing. Coolest thing I ever did with it was write myself a Wargames-style war dialer when I was about 16. After my parents went to sleep I'd run it, and it would wake up everyone in a prefix (or as many of them as it could get through) one by one ovenight, hanging up if it didn't get a modem answer, and printing out the phone number if it did. I wanted to be like Matthew Broderick's character, but what I did with those numbers instead was spend a lot of time looking at login prompts. :-D &gt;Fast forward today as an engineering manager, during the day I write scripts to manipulate spreadsheets and other data forms. But on an evening I’m busy programming in Python for some personal projects, and building robots with my sons controlled with micropython on a weekend. I'm hoping to incorporate it into more of my job as time goes by. I've also been waiting for [Mycroft](https://github.com/MycroftAI) to get to a point where it's viable so my son and I can use it to try automating a few things around the house - this just might be the summer for that!
Yep, bought it awhile ago and never touched it. I'm going through it chapter by chapter while also building my program.
You can use skimage or matplotlib to process images I think. 
Thanks! Yes, been building this myself in my spare time with Django for about 8 months now. I just couldn’t bear how crusty and spammy LinkedIn is anymore. It’s taken a lot of work just to get all the base level features done but aiming to start adding some unique / differentiating features soon. The main focus at the moment is giving developers a clean professional profile and tools to write good blog posts to create a more specialised news/learning source. Like Medium but with more granular language and library topics. Currently have some people writing a few posts about Python, Node, AWS Lambda etc. Anyway, thanks for the encouragement! Means a lot.
I use them for function return type and parameters, rarely for local variables as the majority of the time it's obvious what it is
&gt; Ok so guys let's admit, do you use it? My opinion is that if you want it, you grew out of Python and should move to something else. Also type definition in Python are limited by the nature of its type system: you can't add useful hints to sum or sort for example.
Vscode here. It's feel more lightweight for me.
I use them more for IDE auto-completion than preventing bugs, I wrote about it here: https://medium.com/@shamir.stav_83310/the-other-great-benefit-of-python-type-annotations-896c7d077c6b 
I use them because I really like how they enhance Pycharm's autocompletion. for larger projectsa it's also nice to see the type in the function definition and not have to write them in the doc string.
Codecademy is also a good place to pick up Python syntax.
I've started using PyCharm recently and it's a lot better than VS Code. Personally just trial both and see which one you personally get on with better.
Curly brackets are annoying to type \(on my local keyboard layout\) and read. 
Thank you. Most of the work so far has been on getting base community features sorted, so I haven't had time to work on differentiating features yet. However, the plan is to have: * a newsfeed of informative programming articles. Developers earn reputation by writing posts that are appreciated by the community. So your daily news is better quality than what LinkedIn currently has. * more relevant job opportunities, less noise. You only see jobs that meet the criteria you set, recruiters cannot just spam your inbox. * quantified skills/reputation on your profile that count towards job applications. So recruiters don't have to rely on scanning for keywords through various unstructured resumes/CVs. You build up quantified credibility on topics over time in a single place as opposed to doing HackerRank/Codility test each time you apply for a job. Essentially, aiming to get you to an in\-person interview faster and with less effort. That's the plan so far but I'd be really keen to get feedback and ideas about what you would want from a new professional network for developers.
We have remarkably similar paths and are, as best as my estimates can guess, about the same age. Isn't Python wonderful? It's like the perfect hammer - useful for just about anything.
Python can get very deep and it isn't even hard
this project is the only python i interact with, i wish there were more like it but for different social media channels, currently running on a cloud instance and interacting with people i follow on my Instagram! [https://github.com/timgrossmann/InstaPy](https://github.com/timgrossmann/InstaPy) 
kaggle.com has great data sets and an integrated version of python with jupiter notebooks. 
Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.

I'm not going to downvote an opinion, but that is a daft opinion. Change to a new programming language because you benefit from type hints? 
I prefer jetbrains IDEs, but i only need java, python, c, kotlin, and javascript. if you need any of the languages not officially supported by jetbrains, VS might be a better bet. though there are many plugins for other language support in the jetbrains ecosystem, they vary greatly in quality--even the official ones you can't go wrong with either. and personally, i sometimes wish i had a reason to invest in learning VS so i could give more than a superficial comparison. the few times I used it, it was immediately clear it was a fine product, but i haven't booted into windows in over a year though, and i'm so deeply entrenched in jetbrains, i doubt i will transition without good reason and to be clear, i mean the full-fledged IDE, not VS code
great! what size of installer u've got? I did my app with wxpython and was able to shrink it to 10mb. (also windows) link to app: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/Servers/WEB-Servers/Django-Dev-Web-Unit.shtml
Sound good man! Keep us updated. I think I'd be up for a profile when the time comes. Cheers!
&gt; Change to a new programming language because you benefit from type hints? Change programming language if you start to value features it doesn't value. People want type hints to improve reliability, which is non-goal for Python. Another language can provide you with far more of it today than Python ever will (this isn't critics of the language, I am just stating that dynamically typed languages are good for building software, less good for maintaining it, so shifting goals mandate shifting your tools).
Your reception might be a bit frostier next time then! There's /r/learnpython for questions ;)
&gt; We have remarkably similar paths and are, as best as my estimates can guess, about the same age. Hah, did you happen to take a stopover in the USN along the way? &gt;Isn't Python wonderful? It's like the perfect hammer - useful for just about anything. I'm starting to get that feeling!
&gt; Dayum, and Django is considered “ugly” by modern standards. I wonder what you’d think of Flask. How so?
Well, I have to admit that seems like a relatively minor downside compared to other possibilities, but I can see how it would get tiresome if that's the case. :-)
I taught myself Python a little over 3 years ago and I quickly went from not being programmer to being a programmer. The core language and standard library are really worth understanding. The official documentation is great, you can just read the CSV, json, collections modules etc. And they're super easy to understand. However the real popularity of Python comes from the depth and quality of 3rd party libraries and how easy they are to install. Need something to interact with a database? No problem just pip install pyodbc, need a simple restful web framework that can code in a few lines just pip install flask, etc. Sometimes it seems endless what is out there.
Haha thanks for the warning. I was almost like those poor souls who wander into /r/Linux with questions instead of /r/linuxquestions or /r/linux4noobs. :-D
I just looked at your project, and I think it'd be a good idea to learn the following: 1) virtual environment 2) requirements.txt 3) setup.py 
Oh okay, thanks 
Updates and more detail: this problem still occurred with a shorter time but same number of objects but does not occurs with fewer bodies. The program uses the libraries math, matplotlibs pyplot and Axes3D classes, random and json. The problem occurs when the actual calculations have completed and either pyplot is called. 
pyInstaller is not making an installer, it's making a single .exe Inside you have, a python interpreter, all the required python libs and you python programs. The generated.exe is 60MB. Little bit heavy but hey, nowadays everyone got a 1TB hard disk drive or more and a 1GBps connection^^.
Thank you for the suggestion that would have been a very sensible idea even without the bug! 
Being a programmer is a state of mind. It involves looking at what the computer is doing and thinking about how to make the computer do the hard/boring/repetitive work for you. If you do that and apply critical problem solving skills to problems you encounter, you're a programmer. Regardless of what your business cards say.
I designed and deployed a system using Raspberry Pi and Python 3 to control radio transmitters for broadcast stations. It changes power at predetermined times, monitors transmitter power, and permits an authorized person to shut it down if necessary over the Web. Testing is quick, the script is practically self-documenting, two-dimensional lists and tuples are easy to manipulate.
You can find a lot of data at data.gov
I'm not experienced or anything, but I reckon you would have to choose a simple framework like Flask to do web development. It's a very light framework, good documentation and can be used to make simple websites. I used Flask to make web version of my scripts. Happy learning to you!
Required? No. Beneficial? God yes. You get so many things "for free" by using a framework. Need authentication? Import the default authentication library for your framework. Need a database? You get easy database search and CRUD operations with code that works no matter which database implementation you choose (sqlite, MySQL, Postgres, etc) and (with Django), a slick looking administrative panel so the data entry team can fill the database with the data while you work on the code. And all of that is a few import statements and entries into you config files. It does cost you overhead. You're importing rather large libraries. Most of them are pretty efficient (Flask is super efficient). But honestly on a website, I've only had 2 calls that generated delays greater than network lag and both of them are because of poor database design, not the libraries themselves. I have over normalized the database, so it has to sum up hundreds of transactions tied to about 140 different accounts. If I calculated the new total every time a new transaction took place and saved that in the database, I'd save a ton of overhead there. The main reason I haven't is because the program is on active use and I don't want to risk data loss. I'll fix it over the summer once the kids go home and we're no longer tracking behavior.
Yeah, I also remember digging for whl files, I was not happy haha. I’m getting flashbacks about egg error code 1 or something when I tried to install geopandas.
Just an opinion buddy, no need to over react. Obviously the use case scope is important. But if your just tinkering a quick app for a small project, flask can be fine. If it has a dedicated long term use or if it’ll be used in any production environment then use whatever is best in class for that use case.
A lot of people are salty that I suggested flask lol but just go on YouTube or google flask intro. There’s an abundance of resources out there.
Whether or not type hints assist the developer is nothing but a question of "how well do they keep track of their variable types". Most people who come from statically typed langauges *usually* are helped by type hints because it gives them a direct (yet optional) analogue via tools like mypy, whereas previously those who relied on a statically typed language's compile time checking would be hurt. Those who don't, generally keep track of their typing either by variable name or simply in their head, such that this isn't a problem to begin with. On the other hand, this provides some level of self documentation in regards to method signatures and accessible attributes. But I don't feel as if the code bloat is worth the price. What's worse is if it's a joint project by multiple users one guy will always use type hints while another will never do so, and it causes a lack of consistency in code style. With the push from mypy enthusiasts and some things in the type hints PEP like function overloading, it looks like they want Python to be Java just with a different syntax.
Splitting your project intomodules might be better solution. Imo: both IDE's you've mentioned are quite slow and too big for hobby stuff / comfort use. :) 
Yeah I know what it does.. as I mentioned, if you don't plan to distribute your app it' okay.
To me it has found a few bugs that failed my unit tests as well. However, I was able to immediately see the problem with an IDE highlight showing that a dependency had changed type. To me, it is worth it in documentation alone. However, the IDE support is great, especially when you are pulling an object out of a return or structure and the IDE should have no idea what it is. Type ref and all methods and properties become available. This is a time saver enough to be worth the price of admission. Where I also see benefit is working on a method and forgetting a return. PyCharm has a highlight on the -&gt; DataType and is a gentle reminder that I have a path without a return. 
Never write in perl, but it is known to be the most dislike language in the article analysis about languages' tags in github, if you try to compare it with python....hmm.. lol
I really thought you were going to say Visual Studio, because people would actually point out it's Visual Studio Code
I was mulling that over as I learned Python over the past few weeks (has it been that long) coming from C# as the last language I was working in. On the bright side, I took comfort in that you can enforce type checking at the function/method level in python. Does not help at compile time but certainly puts up little firewalls to prevent buggy data from travelling the system very far. 
Improving reliability is only one use of type hints. Unlike doc strings, it is also a way to fully document the method interface in a way that is both human and computer readable. Sometimes you can make this clear with variable naming, but not always. Python has the option of being dynamically typed. However, you also have the option of using the same type for a variable and rely on the strong typing of the language. If I decide to do that, I should switch to Java or Kotlin or Rust and throw away all of the Python packages I know and solve my problem? That is really dumb.
You can't add strings and integers together. All your values and default values must be only strings or only integers, not both.

Cool! 😎
/r/im14andthisisdeep/
I am working on scrapers that download data from government websites. There is so much data, I am scared my ip will be banned soon.
Hi OP, your best bet would be to browse /r/learnpython 
So let me tell you the bad part of Python so you can deal with it. You don't have to declare variables, which is great if you are not a programmer and SUCKS if you are. You look at a parameter passed to a subroutine and you have no way of knowing if it is an integer, real, array, data structure, or an entire object. This makes reading someone else's code really hard.
This is exactly what I was looking for! I'm dealing with DLL's from different vendors, some are documented, some are almost a mystery. I will try to apply the instructions here and see what happens! 
If your dict contains string, then what is the NA value? 0 is not a string. Try changing that to eg empty string '', or whatever suits your logic the most. 
dude I just read this and I want to share that I started with Python and recently just started learning java and I suddenly realized how irritating syntax can be. I almost wish I did it in reverse. 
Supports Putty key pair? 
But VS Code is also an IDE... or for what project size you feel it is not adequate? I now checked an my project has 98 py files and everything works fine. Also depends if you have Python extensions installed. Anyway, I don't have anything against PyCharm, I just feel it is a bit slow, and also VS Code has arguably better git integration.
In which aspects do you feel it is better? I evaluated it at least two times already, and I always end up with general feeling that I work slower...
well done. ;)
More generally I should say SSH (public-private) key pair
Did a sluggish Ninja edit. 
Ok. I think I need to add a settings button that lets you choose were all the keys are stored....
I follow what you are saying. The thing is, unless I have an issue with my code elsewhere, then all my values are of type int. Therefore I shouldn't be adding str to anything. I will check my code later \- in there, dict2 is actually a dict of dicts, so it is perfectly possible that I'm not pulling out the data I think I am. I'll let you know later. I see now that it is likely that part of the code that is the problem \- the error message was less than helpful at telling me where the problem was on the line

If dict2 is a dict of dict then you are probably pulling the keys. Try changing the default value in the getter and you will get feedback from results 
Where people recommend Flask, I usually recommend Bottle for small and simple services. Otherwise, Django \+ DRF.
Yeah, it's loads better than it used to be, but there is still that sometimes.
Ok, but intellisense is also in VS Code, via python extension.
&gt; Improving reliability is only one use of type hints. Unlike doc strings, it is also a way to fully document the method interface in a way that is both human and computer readable. Sometimes you can make this clear with variable naming, but not always. I am not saying type hints are useless. I am saying that they buy you disproportionally little for the effort. If you spend an effort and attempt to add type hints to all of your code and all of your dependencies (which ultimately is what type-hints proponents are trying to do), you will realise that either you rely to large degree on dynamic nature of the language limiting usability of type-hinting , or you don't need dynamic typing, and switching to another language would get you not only far more reliable type checking, but also static analysis, performance gains, compilation to single binary, and possibly a lot more. &gt; Python has the option of being dynamically typed. Its not an option, it is mandatory. Regardless of any annotations, types are determined and checked at runtime, with all the pros and cons of that. &gt;If I decide to do that, I should switch to Java or Kotlin or Rust and throw away all of the Python packages I know and solve my problem? Most likely similar packages already exist for those languages. If you understand some problem, switching library A for language a to library B for language b is not that big issue. If you consider longer-time scale, such switch makes a lot more sense.
I used to have a chip on my shoulder. I wanted to do things the hard way to truly understand them. I went with C++. I still hold C++ in high regard, but as I got older and learned new things I finally gave in and tried Python. I continued learning new concepts with Python and I found that I could write good software in it that ran at good speeds in less time than it took me to write something in C++. tl;dr: I learned that doing things the smart way was better than doing things the hard way and didn't interfere with learning.
Haha see my comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/8ndhel/dear_python_where_have_you_been_all_my_life/dzvdoza/) about Java. :-D
That is really cool. Python is becoming more and more widely used for everything. 
That's also true. I haven't dug too deep to VSCode extensions..
I'm working on a new technical blog about Python: www.thepythoncorner.com I used to have a Medium publication about Python but unfortunately, Medium is quite unprofitable for who - like me - has started to write technical stuff and has just 300 visits a day. So, if you like technical posts about Python, give www.thepythoncorner.com a try, I'd love to get some feedback ... :) Thank you Dave
Unfortunately it’s not a very active sub
Have you done the icons yourself ? They're really neat
Looks like the good people at /r/MapPorn would enjoy this.
I would love that as an alternative to vba. 
I remember enjoying writing Perl, a while back. It's very quick and easy to write. The problem is that you have to put in a LOT of effort to make it readable. I've used Python pretty extensively, even for very large projects, and while it has some dark corners, overall it's my favorite language. It's very focused on readability and simplifying common code constructs - for example the list comprehension in place of "create a vector, for thing in list, add thing to your vector". And while initially I thought I would hate the code blocks being defined by indentation, any decent IDE handles that nicely. Just be careful with your loops - a common source of subtle bugs is the last line (or several lines) of a loop being indented wrong. It's not a syntax error and it will usually parse and run... It just won't do what you want. 
why would it be bad to distribute it like that?
Hmm that's a good point I hadn't thought of. I like to have them declared just so I can see what I'm working with as the code gets longer. So it's been simple things like fencing in a section of code with a few lines of 40 or 50 hashmarks above and below to draw my eye, and in between those comment lines having something like: user_domainid ={} I see your point though that since this doesn't enforce anything it's really just helping me to keep things straight, not preventing plugging in the wrong kind of data later. See, clear evidence right there that I'm totally not a programmer. :-)
good 4 u
Wowww! Cool 8D very nice work!!! Could you recommend a good reference for tkinter??
To break this down a bit further: - a Jupyter notebook is the environment to write and run your code. It's super interactive and great for displaying results as you work. - just use Pandas for your data (reading, calculating, plotting, and writing). It uses numpy and matplotlib internally, but is much easier to learn and use. 
https://tkdocs.com http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/ and stackoverflow of course.
Yes. Thanks.
There is actually a module that help create visual novels like Phoenix Wright. Check out [Ren'Py!](https://www.renpy.org/). Hope it helps.
Thanks for the great work you are doing here. Is there a way to install .whl files using poetry? for example, installing this [wheel](https://download.qt.io/snapshots/ci/pyside/5.9/1527757453/pyside2/PySide2-5.9.0a1.dev1527705651-5.9.6-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl).
looks really nice, good job!
Yes, I use them extensively when using Python 3.5 and above. They have actually helped me find subtle bugs before entering production. I use Pycharm, so it's helpful that the built in inspection can actually check them as well.
Very nice GUI. on another note, MANY people are using the latest Anaconda distribution which is on python 3.6.4. so asking 3.6.5 as minimum requirement could be problematic if you want a larger audience! well done!
Wow this is exactly the thing I started working on a few weeks ago, a few times giving up with tkinter but nice job 
Pycharm is good, but takes some getting used to. It's similar to Visual Studio (not Code) in many respects. It has built in support for venv, a UI for package management, SCM support, and a great built in debugger among other things. You don't need to spend much time configuring the environment like you do in VS Code. MS did add Python support pre-release for MS VS 2018 (not Code, the full version). However, it was removed for release. I don't know the current state of it though. For your uses, you could try the PyCharm community edition. I use it both on Windows and Linux.
I think it may run on python 3.6.4. I will test it and change the requirements.
Unless you're working on a Django project with several dozen apps, or have very specific needs like remote debugging in Docker containers, I can't really see what more you would need out of VSCode. It already has auto-venv management, built-in linting for multiple linters, debugging, completion/suggestions, refactoring with rope... Did you maybe not install the Python extension?
I would love to use this client 
Pretty nice stuff, thanks for sharing.
Holy shit. Fucking good job, sir. Like it.
I plan to build a simple android app that will query a sql database. I read that there were some services that could help with avoiding being banned but I am not there yet. My scraper works, so I'm pretty happy. 
Holy smokes, that is brilliant! Is this available for Mac? It looks better than Cyberduck for Mac...
I am working on a website to analyze the data of your tipp community (kicktipp.com). Using Python and Dash to parse the data from HTML and presenting the to the user. MaterializeCSS for styling.
That's the point imo... pycharm is very good out of the box. vscode requires fiddling with extensions, json config\-files and what not. Some people actually like tweaking their IDE... I don't. Let's all be thankful that we have many good free alternatives :\-\)
Yes you can specify wheels as dependencies, see https://poetry.eustace.io/docs/versions/#path-dependencies
That sounds like a tremendous amount of work, and that's not even counting the burden of creating the "network effect". I guess what I'd really want is a "professional homepage" that can display relevant information about me, like: * Github projects I maintain, with the amount of stars and forks and other stats * Top posts from my blog * Positive comments from other people * etc. And to have a convenient way to arrange and edit it (could be markdown-based for all I care)
Is the name a a reference to raining blood?
Ok,then I better give vs code more chance. Python extension is installed. What other extensions would you recommend?
Great job!!!
Except Visual Studio has support for Python too and is better then VS Code in every way if you're on Windows. However for Python, PyCharm is certainly better than both.
Aside from debian based OS and windows, how do you test it on freebsd and other linux distros? using vm?
Yes.....also it is a python script, if you have a desktop environment and python installed on any UNIX system it should work.
Yes I am aware of that

What did you use for SFTP? What kind of crypto stuff?
I personally use Vscode because of the python support for vscode
What a positive comment!

Your question is a bit unclear. Can you give an example? In general floating point calculations often don't give exactly the expected result for decimals. Try using `import decimal.Decimal as D` and `D('0.4')` and calculating with that instead, if exact decimal results are required. Also note that `//` is *integer* division.
Until you find something that VSCode isn't doing for you, nothing really. Your Python workflow will be more important than additional extensions, if Python is your main focus. Some advice: Start using [Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/) if you aren't already. VSCode will automatically activate your virtualenv if you use Pipenv. Once you've got a Pipenv for your project, install [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) and [rope](https://github.com/python-rope/rope). Linting is enabled by default with the Python extension, and it'll look for pylint installed in your virtualenv. rope is for refactoring (e.g. right click a symbol &gt; Rename). You can do that with `pipenv install pylint rope`. Most importantly, check out the [VSCode Python tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial) and read all of the documents in the "Next Steps" section at the end.
Thanks for your help. one of my dictionaries \(the one I didn't suspect to be causing the problem \- isn't it always the way?\) was storing ints as str i.e. "5" instead of 5 in an earlier piece of my code.
My best guess is pyCharm is treating files as modules. You probably have a file named dis.py. Rename it and try again.
What would be non integer division? (Float division?) Thanks
Thanks! Will add them to the archive. In the process of gifting all my command-line tools gui's just because. Again, really awesome work- was actually working on an ssh server, and this will help a lot. *hat tip* 
Ah thanks

The [output image](https://i.imgur.com/bwVo0h5.png) for the curious.
&gt; Y = lambda f: (lambda x: x(x))(lambda y: f(lambda *args: y(y)(*args))) The Python version of the Y Cominator was taken from [here](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Y_combinator#Python).
I don't know. Just glancing at your code, it ought to float.
The `PIXELS` variable contains the main comprehensions / generator expressions that repeatedly use the `for x in [expr]` idiom .
VS Code has pipenv support (still waiting on PyCharm to have this) I used to love PyCharm but VS Code is rapidly throwing out features and plugins and I find myself more often in VS Code.
In addition to what everyone else is saying, be aware that floats aren't always accurate: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html

"Iterable of something" doesn't seem very useful to me, especially considering very loose definition of iterable in Python.

No such problem here... case of YMMV I guess. Of course you can reduce resources draining by adjusting inspection settings... but then that's some point and click fiddling !

I have another idea Take Everquest Make a bot that will play a character without any guidance from the main character It needs to be able to detect a specific party member and remain close to them. If it’s a melee It needs to stay within melee range of the target. It also needs to stay behind the target of at all possible. And it needs to be able to go through it’s attack bars. All while avoiding gaining Aggro If it’s a healer then it needs to be able to understand when a heal or buff is needed. It needs to meditate. And it needs to stay within casting range If it’s a caster dps it needs to be able to send a pet in if it has one, it needs to nuke and dot while not not gaining aggro.
It *is* a lot of work! I have a strategy for kickstarting the network that seems to be working so far. It's just about consistently executing that while adding to and refining the site over time. Thanks for the suggestions, all good stuff! Will keep you posted on progress.
I wrote a ton of documentation with sphinx and RTD with a Jira pipeline for building the docs. Our setup was nice in that every push would trigger sphinx to build the documentation and push it to an RTD server. At the same time, RestructuredText, the markup language, was really complicated. It's definitely more powerful than Markdown (and I've never used doxygen) but the language was a much steeper learning curve. With MD you can learn it in a day or two, refering to documentation*occasionally*. With RST I found myself referring to documentation a lot. Even after doing it for a couple weeks. It's definitely more powerful than MD though so if you need very well structured docs it's good.
Hey, memes\_420, just a quick heads-up: **refering** is actually spelled **referring**. You can remember it by **two rs**. Have a nice day! ^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
Actually you can express that in Python using Prototype (structural subtyping/static duck typing). 
Thanks I appreciate it. The thing is - I've tinkered/dabbled with each of them. That's it. I've used them "professionally" in the sense that I built programs with each of them (not counting Java) at least once to aid me in my job. But what I've done has been small scale and as much a learning experience as anything, every time I've done it. I'm not wealthy by any means (I'm the sole provider for a family of 4) but I do earn a decent wage in what could best be described as a "jack of all trades" role - I think if I shifted to programming right now it would be very entry level, and I'm just not in a place in my life where I could take the pay cut. Nonetheless, I really appreciate the encouragement - it's not so often you see that kind of thing on reddit. :-)
That's very kind, thank you. I like to take ideas and inspiration from various sites like GitHub, Heroku, AngelList, Intercom and others, building mainly on top of a Bootstrap foundation. At the very least I want to ensure that it looks better than LinkedIn. If there's something I don't quite like the look of then I'll focus my energy on crafting it until it looks right.
Sadly I haven't used the above to an extent that I can compare and contrast them with the above. Do give pypette a whirl and let me know what you like and what you don't so that I can improve. In the meantime I will use the above and try to come up with my own findings.

I presume this is an overlay GUI for underlying SFTP binaries?
When it's done, are you putting it on GitHub?
Can you send me the code? I've been working on something similar myself.
A library that uses the SL4A library for Android to scan book barcodes, then sends data over to my server to get the title and author from an ISBN through Amazon. Takes that data then adds it to a MySQL database.
This looks really good. I've made tkinter apps and it does notttt look this pretty haha
Dude this is amazing .. I have been wanting to do something similar for work. Checking it out now, thanks for the inspo 
This is so cool! Congratulations. 
how do you make tkinter looks so good? I tried one back then and the gui is really bad/hard to make it good

&gt; Tl;dr Poke holes in my plan to have my server send python code as a string to my client (which will then evaluate it). If anybody notices what you are doing, it makes your server a much more valuable target than any generic run of the mill web server, since if it gets compromised it will be useful for creating a volunteer botnet of all your users pretty much instantly. That means the likelihood of somebody actively trying to compromise it is higher than normal. Even if they fail to accomplish a full compromise, the attempts could result in DOS and other problems.
I'm making a script to download payslips from my email and collect data from them.
It's not *required*, but it may save you a lot of pain. Flask is actually absurdly light and abstract - setting up a CGI script will almost certainly take longer and be more of a pain to maintain than a quick Flask setup. Django is more of a somewhat intimidating kitchen sink of features and gives you less room to do things your own way, so it's more involve to set up. On the other hand, it anticipates what you'll likely need for a long term app, so you don't screw yourself by having to figure out how to integrate something critical further down the line. Both are also extensible, unlike your homebrew code, so if for example you suddenly need to send emails from your server, you can just import a high-level email library rather than setting up ANOTHER homebrew solution from scratch with SMTP.

Feels good posting in here. Downloaded Python and Pycharm. Was told by a friend about BS4 and started scraping an individual recipe webpage to a CSV file last weekend. This week I’ve figured out how to scrape the hundreds of webpage URLs (yes using a random timer so it’s not one massive hit on their site). Next is to scrape every recipe. Lots of fun for someone with minimal experience.
Scrape data, Curate ot, build an API for it, profit. 
As a noob to Python (but fairly experienced VS C# coder), I found the Intellisense in Pycharm to be much more helpful than the VS Code version. My 2c though.
Do your own homework, kid :p
Debian stable is still on 3.5....
Ahead of time Python checking is completely Pythonic by using type annotations: https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html e.g.: def foo(x: str) -&gt; int: return len(x.replace('e', '')) You can then use MyPy, Pyre, or PyCharm to type check your code ahead of time before you execute it. I've been slowly getting in to the hang of writing type annotations by default, particularly because it let's PyCharm know how to autocomplete passed in variables on a function or method.
it uses paramiko so thats all built in
Thanks everyone.. Will try your suggestions..
That's not bad, have you tried pypy? And that is one insane list comprehension :)

I somewhat wish that I had started with Vagrant, as it seems to utilize the idea of infrastructure as code, but at this point, I know a fair bit about VirtualBox, and don't want to add another layer of complexity. Also, since I am on it, I will also be working on setting up \`Jenkins\` and \`setuptools\` on one of the VMs, so I can continuously run my unit\-tests from now on. Hopefully, it will be worth the effort.
You can't learn the language in a couple of days. I would say brush up on the syntax.
Thanks! I understand, just want to show I know some basics for statistics. Its for a big data trainee ship.
Well it’s monolithic and the templating requires too much abstraction and isn’t very intuitive. Generally new companies all use Flask or other micro framework. Just search AngelList for Flask vs Django job openings. Huge difference. 
Spend the weekend writing some sort of program in python to manipulate bulk data.

[Python's tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
I think I get what you are saying (the question is a little confusing in my opinion). I think you are trying to “naormalize” the values. If the values are normally distributed, then you want it’s z-score. Or you could choose another distribution and get a z-score like value using the CDF of the distribution. Or you could convert each number to a “percentile”. All of those ways would get get the units out of your values. But you should be able to defend any of the choices. It sounds like you need to apply some statistics and then look for support for those in the libraries you mentioned.
By 'sync' do you mean check time stamps of each file and use the file with the latest time stamp?
As a complete noob.. what exactly is this? 
I've had the same experience and still today whenever Python is doing magic in the background, in my mind, I'm still trying to imagine what is happening in C. For example, I had this neural network assignment to do for school and I wanted to get some extra experience with Python. For some reason, after I got rid of my for-loops and used numpy vector additions/multiplications instead, I got a substantial performence increase... but isn't it essentially just doing that in the background? Weird.
I would suggest you do the project euler questions. https://projecteuler.net/ They start slow, but build up. Even better each question has a dedicated forum with example implementations done in python. It's a good way to do a self study in a language when under pressure. If you can get through at least 30-40 of the questions you should be in good shape by monday to answer algorithm based questions. 
PM me. This is a 2 day job with 3hrs max a day. I'll get it done. I've done it before for counting shares and likes on Twitter and Facebook posts for a client project a few years back, I still got the code, might need to update it for the APIs according to rate limitation policies etc. 
You know you can run a web server and access the website using a browser like Chrome/Firefox? It is the same thing. You can run a FTP/SFTP server and access all your files using a FTP/SFTP client.
Looks good.
Awesome, really appreciate it. This was exactly something I was looking for!
Bravo! You are skilled! 
Link please! Thank you.
Look into the following: \-Requests module \-BeautifulSoup4 Thats pre much all u need, request the site check if stock has changed, if it has proceed to add to cart. Bot development is more about understanding the website and the e\-commerce management system, as well as being competent in programming.
As an even bigger noob, what is an FTP/SFTP server?
I like the type annotation idea and can see how this could be useful for aiding maintainance of large codebase documentations. The only reason why I am a bit hesitant to adopt is is that it's a relatively new feature and backwards incompatible (I typically always run the latest Python version, but I realize that not many people (can) do that -- this is more of an "who's the target audience for that code" issue, though). Of course, there is the "type comment" trade-off. However, I think this is much less useful since they don't show up in the help docs etc. E.g., ```python def add(element # type: List[int] ): # type: (...) -&gt; None self.elements.append(element) ``` (PS: copied that one from the article, I think it should be `add(self, element # type: List[int]` , not `add(element # type: List[int]` ??) ```python &gt;&gt;&gt; help(add) Help on function add in module __main__: add(element) ```
Thanks. Much appreciated :)

Why did you choose tkinter as gui framework? I have a small project in mind which needs a gui framework, for context.
* read the tutorial on the Python website. This should take an afternoon; * get a book about programming job interviews, do the exercises in Python as much as you can; * browse the doc for the standard library;
Thank you, will find a fix
Tkinter comes with python and is very easy to use. Also this is the only GUI framework I know. I am planning to explore pyGTK or wxpython.
&gt;The only time I wish I used a different language than Python is when I am working on a super large and complex project. What's wrong with Python for large and complex projects? 
/r/learnpython You just need to divide the series by its sum.
Thanks for the info..
Hey was looking through your comments. There's a lot of instances where you write "weather" when you mean "whether"
Nothing wrong with it. It's just that a statically typed language feels safer when working on larger projects.
Thanks for pointing that out. I will change it.
Why is this better than just hosting the *.tar.gz on any server you want and installing with `pip install http://yourserver/yourpackage.tar.gz`? You still need to point pip to the right URL Or even installing directly from git repo like `pip install git+git://yourserver/yourrepo.git`
MD is simpler, I agree. Especially if you are used to HTML, I think there is an easier 1\-to\-1 correlation between what you write and what you get. For example with the use of # or ## making h1 or h2 tags, etc. However, I found RST much easier to extend with custom directives. One of the successes of MD is that it is commonly found \(for instance, in here\), while RST is more of a niche markup language. If you are curious, you can see that I've written all my blog posts in RST, they are on [Github](https://github.com/PFTL/website/tree/master/content/blog)
Nice! Will send you a pm
I found duck typing to be pretty safe. It either quacks or throws. I admit that finding issues during runtime is less desirable than compile time, but this is very minor. As soon as pylint starts enforcing type hints https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/647 this will become a non-issue.
I have some experience in this area, and would be happy to help. Are you interested in getting the complete HTML of the page you query, or just specific pieces of data from it? My go-to when dealing with locally generated HTML is a combination of the Selenium Webdriver Python package and either Chromedriver, or PhantomJS, both of which are downloaded and installed just like any other program you might download from the internet, and both are available for Windows or Mac OS. Chromedriver: http://chromedriver.chromium.org/ PhantomJS: http://phantomjs.org/download.html Selenium Webdriver is a Python library, and is installed with pip, type “pip install selenium” in the command prompt. It controls the automated browsers (Chromedriver or PhantomJS, or other similar ones). Read this: http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/api.html Chromedriver looks just like standard Google Chrome. If you tell Selenium to open a certain webpage, it will tell Chromedriver to load that page, and an automated Chrome window will open up and load that page. This will also execute any Javascript that would normally load. You could also use PhantomJS, the main difference being that it’s headless, or doesn’t have any visible UI. No window will pop up, but the page is still being loaded and executed as it would normally. PhantomJS has been faster in my experience than Chromedriver, so if you don’t need to actually see a webpage load, it might serve you better. Now, once the webpage is loaded, you can use the “driver.page_source” to get the full dynamically generated HTML, which has whatever new data is put there by the site’s JS. This HTML can then be sent to BeautifulSoup, and you can extract whatever you want from it. Here’s something else: sometimes you wouldn’t need to even load a page to get dynamically generated data. Often (more so for foreign sites…) the data can be get-requested easily with no credentials. You can use Chrome’s dev-tools (press F12) to watch the network traffic when you request stuff or load a page, and catch which request sends for that data. You might luck out and get the data you want as a nicely organized and very fast JSON file, meaning no need to slowly load and parse lots of useless HTML, you can just use the Requests or url.lib packages to request the url for that JSON data. Tkinter and PyQt4 are both frameworks for making GUIs for Python. Personally I wouldn’t bother with them unless you want it to look nice for other people, you’d probably spend a lot more time getting those to work nicely than dealing with the HTML requesting and parsing. You might have an easier time just making it a command line interface. You can use the Python package Pyperclip very easily to integrate copy and pasting into Python input prompts, so you wouldn’t have to type out long URLs. Hope that’s of some help, if you send me your code I’d be happy to take a look.
Assuming you mean specifically every imported module / package, not distributed dependencies themselves, in theory yes, in practice it's more trouble than it is worth. You'd have to have something like import inspect, ast all_ = ["modulename"] # create custom NodeVisitor visitor for curr in all_: currModule = __import__(curr) currSrc = inspect.getsource(currModule) currAst = ast.parse(currSrc) visitor.visit(currAst) Where `visitor.visit` appends module names from import nodes to `all_`, if not already in all. Keep in mind this can grow in time needed and memory needed exponentially, and you should generally use some form of queue instead of a list to resolve the exponential memory growth. However this reallt is easier said than done because there's lots of ways to import a module. Hell, you saw above using `__import__` in order to get the module source from the module name. There's plenty of other setups as well. If you mean package dependencies, `pip freeze`
If you read the article you would know about it and it's already implemented in mypy. You can use it as of a month ago or so.
Seems to be a worthy extension for Phyton 3.8. True in the REPL does not show up but ide like pycharm will show it.
While you're absolutely correct, I think the main gripe is in the naming scheme. The most recent docs explicitly state info about groupby and what it's meant for &gt; The operation of groupby() is similar to the uniq filter in Unix. It generates a break or new group every time the value of the key function changes (which is why it is usually necessary to have sorted the data using the same key function). That behavior differs from SQL’s GROUP BY which aggregates common elements regardless of their input order. However the name *implies* that it would behave like SQL's `GROUP BY`. When I think "hey, a function to group by some key function called groupby", nothing in my head immediately pops out "if the key func's values aren't already adjacent in the container I'll make new groups". IMO, this function should have been called `uniq` or some derivative to denote that similarity, or since that makes little sense, maybe `cluster`, as in, clustering values in a container that match from some keyfunc. Maybe I'm crazy but `cluster` seems to directly imply new cluster per occurrence. And then `groupby` should be the equivalent of def groupby(iterable, key=None): return cluster(sorted(iterable, key=key), key=key) Or the functional equivalent (there's probably a much more performant looping mechanism that I'm not thinking of). This can trip up even experienced python developers, because the name itself is somewhat paradoxical.
I'm hoping to maybe enter a programming competition. You get a bunch of problems to solve. Their site's got lots of practice questions so I'm working on those. I was trying to make a simple Skype bot earlier in the week but I think there's a problem with the module I'm trying to use \(Skype4Py\). I was trying to make it in Debian. Apparently Skype4Py only works on 32 bit OS's, but Skype's linux version can only be downloaded onto 64 bit OS's. So I was using a 64 bit OS so I think that's why the module wasn't working.
I just finished a several week long project at work doing this. Selenium’s Chromedriver is the way to go. Looks like someone already gave you a comprehensive response so I just want to offer a word of warning. If you want the browser hidden, be careful. Headless browsers need special work arounds for downloads and run significantly slower than non-headless drivers. I lost a couple days of pulling my hair out on that.
Wow, this is so nice. Did you design it yourself?
Me too!
I've bookmarked it! It's really great! One thing that I'd like to suggest, though, is to maybe change the design of the home page a little bit. It almost feels like I'm still on Reddit.
Being the dev lead I've mandated that all new code must us type hints (even improvements to our legacy 2.7). We also build packages to be used by other teams, in that use case its invaluable. 
vscode for writing/testing, pycharm for debugging. I am running few of the components in local docker containers (and redis/db) vscode ~ 60Mb RAM vs pycharm ~ 1.5GB. it makes a difference. 
Ok maybe you did the tweaking and then forgot about it. I am now trying PyCharm again, and it is not even apparent how to run simple script. It says "No paths given. Nothing to do 😴". Why paths? I don't know. :-)
Try adding a pause to let the js fully load the page... #import ui, requests w=ui.WebView() w.load_url(urlstr) #import time time.sleep(1) #need time for page to fully load... src=w.eval_js('document.documentElement.outerHTML')
Please :) 
HMAC requires a pre-shared key on both sides. How do you prevent key extraction from the client code?
In the same vein, there's no reason to set PYTHONPATH. Python should be able to find its libraries based on it's prefix and/or on how it's invoked. By the way, it looks like you set your prefix weirdly. Your prefix should not include `lib/python2.7` because python will add that itself. That's why you're seeing duplication of those directories in `sys.path`.
HMAC requires pre-shared keys on both sides. So you either need a unique pre-shared key per client, or any client would be able to sign arbitrary code the other clients would accept. Using the client password as a key is a really bad idea by the way. Also, keys should expire fast or you won't be able to revoke leaked keys. How you plan to generate, transfer, store and manage these keys?
Just get anaconda with spyder
I have experimented with numerous ways of installing python. I find the best, the easiest and the most complete way to do that is using the Anaconda distribution. You just basically have to go to https://www.anaconda.com/download/ and choose which distribution to download. I recommend downloading Python 3.
I'm really looking forward to it too!
Interesting. For my pyqt apps, pyinstaller's exe-s are usually in the 15-25Mb range. Not sure if the difference comes from kivy or some other libs you're using. Also, even if it's from kivy, that shouldn't be taken as a slight against it. As you said, huge drives and fast connections. kivy is one of the top 3 python GUI frameworks in my opinion. Not the one that I'd recommend, but if it works for you, that's great. Also, in my experience distributing via pyinstaller's .exe should be just fine.
this. thank god we have jedi coded by a nice smart guy! he is the real mvp
Flask is a joy to work with, and more explicit. But you can put something up quicker with Django than Flask. Sometimes monolithic isn’t bad.

Oh 😬. Just try putting something like python 3 IDE into the app store and see what that shows
Thank you, yes I did :\)
Great! Will do.
Yeah, that's what the Pythonista3 app is. It's a geat app, just this one drawback is kind of disappointing.
Oh 😐
How much power and RAM do you have? To be honest, it seems like what you looking for are not neural networks but simple control engineering which is a very mature field: https://www.controleng.com/single-article/loop-tuning-fundamentals/6190e833ca356d8a9ab368ec922a1771.html Then if you want more have a look into the libraries in C/C++, Python won't cut it for embedded devices. Have a look in the libraries I mentioned in this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/88dlrn/100_line_neural_network_library_in_c/dwkpcq2/. You can also try my own library in Nim https://github.com/mratsim/Arraymancer/ which includes automatic gradient backpropagation and is suitable for embedded devices.
Also take a look at ssh2-python as a replacement for paramiko, I think it's faster.
I'm super fuckin dumb lol, I just had to update the app and now it's python 3.6... haha
You're in for a world of assumed types.
Use qt. Its well documented. There are lots of tutorials and above all its crossplatform.
Hmmm...I am not sure about replacing paramiko (I will have to rewrite and test a lot of code) but I will keep this in mind for future versions.
If you are sending arbitrary code to execute on my servers that I cannot control, I am not running it, period. Send client version with the requests and reject if to old.
&gt; I don't use anything other than Windows . Usability is important. You sir just divided by zero.
As many have said Anaconda is a great way to get pretty much everything you'll need or want in a single installation. If you're looking for an IDE PyCharm is my personal prefferance and from what I've seen seems to be the best available and they have a free option. 
Python is very simple to set up. Just go to the official website and download the latest package for your OS. It’s that simple: you download the file, click a few buttons - and everything’s up and running and ready to rock!
Sounds cool. Do you have a github link or something? 
:) Good point. 
Sure remind me next week, not in office until Tuesday
Thanks!! 
Thank you!! Yes, I know, the design is terrible at the moment. Unfortunately I’m not a designer and I’ve got no budget to ask someone fix it right now, but I hope the things will change soon... 
What does he want to learn? Python XY is a really easy way to start if it's for scientific or image stuff. It's how I started with zero programming experience. It will install Python 2.7, the Spyder IDE and a whole bunch of libraries.
This is awesome. I'm new to python and this is truly inspiring. 
I see. Thank you for that. I wasn’t sure if it would be necessary as I will be building against this version of Python with custom modules so PYTHONPATH will need to be edited later, but I guess not for base libs. The prefix itself was actually `$HOME/software/python/2.7.15`. I set PYTHONPATH to the /lib/python2.7 as that’s what the docs said to do.
On Windows download it from the official site. With Mac and Linux you already have python2. That and some text editor like Sublime or Notepad\+\+ is perfect. Anaconda is a decent low hanging fruit but is very bloated and has some oddities about it that can cause issues. Pycharm is a gigantic IDE that is just unnecessary until you know why you would even need it. Both will feel like monolithic coming from C.
Are you sure ? You can connect using nautilus, using sftp:/// urls. I think most things that support sftp will work ?
`apt-get install python` Edit a plain text file. Then run `python &lt;textfile&gt;` 
Why gtk? Just curious since there seem to be a lot more momentum behind qt. 
https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/F/ftp.html
I find it's usually better to install custom stuff to standard locations (or a virtual environment) rather than set a PYTHONPATH. For example, unless you're careful to keep them isolated, environmental variables will get picked up by your system python install, not just this one. Are you sure about prefix? `lib-tk` and friends should really be in `$HOME/software/python/2.7.15/lib/python2.7`, not `$HOME/software/python/2.7.15/lib/python2.7/lib/python2.7`. 
Great job!
You need aderoll
I think /lib/python2.7 is being appended due to PYTHONPATH. I’ll be able to test this once I get in to my office. The prefix and everything else is fine, /bin, /include, and /lib are all under the same directory. Unfortunately, I have to install everything else to individual custom locations as I have to mimic the setup used on our HPC cluster which loads libraries/modules with its own custom module system. 
Now traumatized for life, marrying network to tkinter is ptsd inducing stuff oft nightmares. Congratz you keep enough sanity to use reddit
Nice job! I think you could improve distribution providing a [setup.py](https://setup.py), or / and using [nuitka](http://nuitka.net/) for freezing the application! That way, you will be able to install it directly via pip or pipsi ?
You're using %s formatting to fill in SQL, that's what's happening. [Quoth the manual](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/sqlite3.html): &gt; Usually your SQL operations will need to use values from Python variables. &gt; You shouldn’t assemble your query using Python’s string operations because doing so is insecure; it makes your program vulnerable to an SQL injection attack (see https://xkcd.com/327/ for humorous example of what can go wrong). &gt; &gt; Instead, use the DB-API’s parameter substitution. Put ? as a placeholder wherever you want to use a value, and then provide a tuple of values as the second argument to the cursor’s execute() method. (Other database modules may use a different placeholder, such as %s or :1.) For example: &gt; And here is how you SHOULD do it: t = ('RHAT',) c.execute('SELECT * FROM stocks WHERE symbol=?', t) print(c.fetchone()) 
pipenv is really amazing! THX for recommendation!
Username checks out though
Thanks for the reply, I appreciate it. I've tried that and I get sqlite3.InterfaceError: Error binding parameter 0 - probably unsupported type. purchases = [row,'01/01/01'] cursorinner = conn.execute ("SELECT job.job_client, job.job_date, worker.worker_name, job.job_hours, job.job_desc FROM Job INNER JOIN Worker on worker.worker_id = job.job_worker WHERE job.job_client = ? AND job.job_date &gt;= ? ORDER BY worker.worker_name, job.job_date" , purchases)
It seems it might be that my format in my DB is Date, and I'm trying to put in a str(). It accepts it if I type it in directly, but not if I try to insert it. 
The hardest part for me when working with large Python project is figuring out what kind of object or data format a function returns. You often times have to read the code and understand that something is a boolean or a dictionary.. With Java you know right off the bat without really looking at the code. 
File Transfer Protocol / Secure File Transfer Protocol Protocols for working with files / directories over the internet.
I am thinking of creating a 'Setup.exe' (win32 c++ app) that just downloads files from Github and automatically install python. This is a future project that I am planning to do. I have tried cx_Freeze and py2exe, both did not work properly. I have never tried nuitka though...I will give that a try....
Haha... Nice one..
I’ve heard pandas was inspired by R so take a look at that. I think you want to convey that you know *what* to do and *how* you’ll do it is just a matter of transitioning to the right syntax. 
&gt; row And what is `row` containing? job.job_client has a type in the database, is the `row` variable one, exactly one, and only one of a `job_client` or is it something you got out of the database ( which usually is tuples, sometimes a tuple with a single value in it) 
I recommend you to take a look to docker, so switch between languages and versions is as easy as edit a command. For python, you can get PyCharm for free or use any other IDE with python support.. and if you know how to code in C in python is kind of similar...
cursor = conn.execute("SELECT DISTINCT Client.client_name FROM Client INNER JOIN JOB on job.job_client = client.client_name") for row in cursor: The Original post's code. row prints as a tuple of (client_name,) &lt;- this might be the issue. 
Deeper and deeper... *way down*...
Finally got my reddit bot mostly up and running. I need to add some infrastructure to the code but it functions largely how I want it too. I'll let it start commenting on posts in a supervised mode once I have built up the infrastructure to make sure the bot doesn't comment on the same posts multiple times in different runs. After that, the first phase of the bot should be done.
