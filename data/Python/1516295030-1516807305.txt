Thanks, I fixed the typo and replaced it with a static image
I'm not familiar with that module but would definitely be interested if you have second to explain.
This functionality is also included with `limit_denominator` as /u/gameboycolor already said: In [1]: from fractions import Fraction In [2]: pi = Fraction(3.14159) In [3]: pi Out[3]: Fraction(7070651414971679, 2251799813685248) In [4]: pi.limit_denominator(10) Out[4]: Fraction(22, 7) In [5]: pi.limit_denominator(100) Out[5]: Fraction(311, 99) In [6]: pi.limit_denominator(1000) Out[6]: Fraction(355, 113)
Could you use this to read the screen with an application open? Like a game? Maybe I could train a bot to finally beat Nuclear Throne for me.
Depends. In this case it’s not because you’re just checking the result, but if you were working with the reversed string reversed would be the more pythonic approach.
If you are interested, I wrote to the author of Automat and he was saying: &gt; I can say that automat is probably not your best option for a huge complex DFA use-case like byte parsing. It's more geared towards "workflow" DFAs. You might want to check out something like pyparsing instead. 
ScrapE.
There's still the numerator constraint. Plus, it gives you one value, not a list of possible values from which you can select anything that you like. Sure, you can loop it to get the list but I'd rather have more convenience of typing a simple line instead.

Well, you can still say, "I think it's a masterpiece". There's nothing wrong with that.
Hmm, I hate to say, but I've never used Linux. If you have the equivalent of Terminal/command prompt where you can run python. Try running an instance of the python version that your computer is saying already has your desired stuff installed. Once you're running specifically that python just try importing your desired stuff again. This way we can at least hopefully verify that error message and make sure the install is actually working. Sometimes they don't. Then from there, we only have to figure out how to install to the python you actually want it to be installed in. I'm still fairly sure that your stuff is just being installed to a python version you're not using for this. 
Please use `enumerate` for counting, not that unpythonic manual version.
yes
Regarding multiple pages, you can use multiprocessing to put in several requests for the different pages at the same time. http://chriskiehl.com/article/parallelism-in-one-line/ +1 for beautifulsoup for parsing. Look at the site's robot.txt to see what pages they request people not scrape. For example: https://www.reddit.com/robots.txt Disallow: /*.json Disallow: /*.json-compact Disallow: /*.json-html Disallow: /*.xml Disallow: /*.rss Disallow: /*.i Disallow: /*.embed Disallow: /*/comments/*?*sort= Disallow: /r/*/comments/*/*/c* Disallow: /comments/*/*/c* Disallow: /r/*/submit Disallow: /message/compose* Disallow: /api Disallow: /post Disallow: /submit Disallow: /goto Disallow: /*after= Disallow: /*before= Disallow: /domain/*t= Disallow: /login Disallow: /reddits/search Disallow: /search Disallow: /r/*/search Disallow: /r/*/user/ Disallow: /gold?
do reply back if you tried it yourself/got answer
You can use https://github.com/liiight/notifiers Full disclosure, I'm its creator. It'll do pretty much everything all there other suggestions you got do (twilio and prowl not supported yet thought, but telegram and pushbullet are, along with 10 other services). It's also got great cli support
Might want to check out OpenCL too! 
&gt; If it's impossible to do as /u/KyleG says It should be possible. One of my current projects contains this line sys.modules['pyrow'] = MockedPyrow in order to run a unit test on a module that imports pyrow on a system that doesn't have pyrow installed (otherwise you get ImportError)
Did you upgrade through conda?
If it is all happening in a single process, consider implementing this yourself using the python object model (i.e. classes) and the regular old flow of execution. I like defining base classes to inherit from for this kind of thing.
If you have lots of questions like this, you're better off asking in an IRC channel, like #Python on Freenode
How about all(x == y for x, y in zip(word, reversed(word))) with the advantage of short-circuiting! \&gt;_&lt;
So there are a number of options similar to multiprocessing. In the past, to distribute loads over a multi-core computer or a cluster, I have used [ipyparallel](https://ipyparallel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), it's very easy to use and in essence provides you a `map` function like the one you get in multiprocessing. Recently, [dask](https://distributed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) has also come up, but I have not experience with it (other than noting that you do also get a `map` method ;-D). Also depending on the problem, you may be able to code your own version using just simple linear algebra (e.g. if the function to minimise is linear). But your problem might not be amenable to that treatment.
Dunno if it's just personal style, but the way I would do this is the new `concurrent.futures`.
Most people are pretty new to Tkinter. I'd recommend PyQt.
Trying to learn d3 js and integrating that with a python backend. Basically a GUI for my finance charting function.

That's not a lot of data. You can probably run that on one node, which will save you a lot of headache in trying to split the data across multiple machines and deal with a queuing system. What's the run time on a single-core, 5 minutes? I would just use `concurrent.futures` which is a much nicer interface for `multiprocessing`. If `LMfit` releases the GIL you might be able to use a `cf.ThreadPoolExecutor`, otherwise you can use a `cf.ProcessPoolExecutor`. The interface for both executors is the same, so it's easy to switch.
I built the robot hardware and she balances. So I am able to generate a fairly large dataset that matches inputs to desired outputs required for balancing. So this is where I need more knowledge on the topic (and I'm quite excited to get into). I thought that it might be possible to use the input/output data I collect with the PID control strategy to replace the whole online training thing. Based on the brief chats I've had with people who know things, I am told that this is possible - at least in theory. Thanks for the links. I will check them out. 
I really want to get into ipyparallel, but can't seem to find a good guide for it, for me it's the setup and connecting to the nodes that I am struggling with, even before I get onto the actual parallelizing aspect. any resources that you know of to help would be great.
Two things...neither of which is very helpful. First, this belongs in /r/learnpython Second, collected from around the posts: &gt; im, cos, u, smth, tmr, "a assignment", thats, tmr, xd Really? Is typing that hard? People make typos all the time, myself very much included, but this is ridiculous.
I don't really have the time to look at your code, but if you had a single host with 16-24 cores you can knock that down into the 7-10 minute range. Given typical queuing times on clusters, you're probably better off not going there. It might be worthwhile talking to your cluster admin and ask what typical wait times are for jobs. OTOH, your problem sounds like you can split it into many jobs, so you might be able to submit a lot of jobs, all requesting one-core, and sneak into available cores across the cluster. To put things in perspective, I've typically used clusters in situations where you need 1-10 years of CPU time. So 20 nodes, 16 cores each, running for a month. 
I tried games and video and worked fine if you can program something to read the images that you get you will have no problem at all.
i tried using it on my windows machine, getting 0.16-0.25 sec by using mss().shot(), which is saving 'monitor-1.jpg'. tried on pi, using vnc, getting 1.2 sec for each screenshot. python3.6, using mss(display=':0.0').shot() to get the screenshot. how are you getting 0.005? any other method needs to be used? 
Use spyder. Console is IPython and spyder is a decent IDE.
Ok well a raspberry pi is essentially a small general purpose computer. It has an operating system and a lot of built in peripherals to interact with the outside world (bluetooth, wifi, usb, hdmi, aux, ethernet, etc.). It can even mount a microSD card as extra storage. Microcontrollers, on the other hand, are specialized computing devices that vary widely in complexity. Nowadays, basically every electronic device has one or more microcontrollers controlling some aspect of it. They (typically) have no OS. When they power on they immediately start to execute whatever program is flashed onto their ROM. They are also (usually) very cheap depending on what functions/abilities they have (ADCs/DACs, communication, clock speed, etc). Now suppose you are designing some sort of electronic device that you want to be able to communicate over WiFi and play music. Using a raspberry pi for this is overkill. It has a lot of extra stuff that you don't need. It's also pretty expensive when all you really need in a WiFi transceiver, a basic controller and a DAC.

Yes, you can record games. I've done it with a first person shooter, PUBG. See [https://github.com/andrewzwicky/PUBGIS/blob/master/pubgis/minimap_iterators/live.py](https://github.com/andrewzwicky/PUBGIS/blob/master/pubgis/minimap_iterators/live.py). Do be aware that it can have behavior differences depending on how the particular games implements fullscreen functionality. See [https://github.com/andrewzwicky/PUBGIS/issues/41](https://github.com/andrewzwicky/PUBGIS/issues/41). Overall it's a great library and has a sane interface and I haven't seen any real performance problems.

First, check out /r/learnpython for stuff like this. The None is the return value of your function. When you call report_exam_avg, it first prints the value, then returns none. The python REPL then prints the return value of the function, which is None. Run the code from a file instead, and you won't see the return value.
Functionally any name for self is as good as any other (short of some sort of wierd runtime argument name analysis which you shouldn't encounter) but it's considered bad style and would be rejected by every open source project and job
Code conventions exist for a reason. Use them.
upgrade *through* conda? How can I do it? I tried to set it up through Settings &gt; Project Interpreter and had to manually add the modules I wanted from conda even though I chose conda by clicking on its logo when adding local (conda environment). Those modules are part of conda and I'm surprised I had to add them manually in the Project Interpreter window. I'm using: * Conda 4.3.30 * Python 3.6.3 * PyCharm CE 2017.3.2 
&gt; I did a replace all in Sublime to change 'Self' to 'instance' I understand it's longer (twice as long) but it helps my readability. It may help _you_ understand it, but it does **not** improve your code's readability. In fact, it's unexpected and distracting and that hinders your code's readability quite a bit. In almost all cases, you should follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) to a T.
The thing is I don't need full screen screenshot, I'm taking a screen shot of small part of the screen that's why. The thing is that in PIL changing the size didn't make a lot of difference. In my Pi full screen i'm getting 80ms and with PIL I'm getting 4500ms. Also i'm not saving, i keep it in the ram and process it, i just need to get a color to send to my yeelights. Also CPU usage was very different, with this I get 15% and with PIL i was getting 90%, so maybe there ways to improve it, but i think the problem maybe is the ram.
I see this as a good lesson for newbies especially because the newer you are the easier it is to get used to doing things in a way that only makes your code more readable for you. That’s why I think it’s important to get very comfortable reading and writing with the conventions before learning how to deviate from them.
I can't imagine going to microsoft for python certification personally. If you're from a microsoft shop and know it's a thing, great. But I've never seen a python candidate with a python exam certification, and think I would be skeptical of one who did.
From my experience, self teaching and course work sometimes leads to burnout and distaste for the skill you're interested in learning. Working a bit more free form, writing applications that you're interested in creating. Any issues you come across can most likely be Googled. Might I suggest working through a few [beginner](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python/py-introduction) [challenge](http://codingbat.com/python) courses first. From there, you'd be able to think of your own challenges like a game or a script to increase your productivity.
Nice article. You wrote "Namedtuples, same as tuples, are immutable, which means you can change the object after it was created.". You probably meant "cannot"?
Fixed, thanks
If he doesn't have full control, invoke the application he can't change with something like: ##### trickery.py import inspect def my_decorator(my_func): def some_behavior(): pass def some_other_behavior(): pass def get_calling_line(): return inspect.stack()[-1][-2][0] def wrapper(): if 'bar_test' in get_calling_line(): some_behavior() else: some_other_behavior() return wrapper Then when there is unchangeable code like #### unmodifiable.py @his_module.his_decorator bar_test(): pass @his_module.his_decorator foo_test(): pass He could have his wrapping code do something like import sys import trickery sys.modules['his_module'].his_decorator = trickery.my_decorator code_that_invokes_rest_of_application() And then whenever the unmodifiable code calls `bar_test`, his wrapper function can know that it was bar_test that was invoked and not foo_test, and behave accordingly. Maybe I've misunderstood the additional challenge you've proposed, though, so apologies if this is going nuts on a hypothetical.
Then you did not look properly. 
What is the description of the problem in the assignment? Does it actually tell you to write a function which *prints* something? Return the value from the function instead of printing it inside the function, and print the returned value outside the function. Or just call the function; Jupyter will display the value without the need for an explicit print.
I dont claim to be a good programmer but I'm posting here in the hopes that someone might find some of the figure generation code useful. All simulations were run on open source software as well. https://github.com/youngmp/park_and_ermentrout_2017 Edit: there is a readme.txt file which gives a high level description of everything, and the file "generate_figures.py" is the file that generates all the figures. Im happy to share the latex as well since the functions might not be in the same order as the paper.
This worked! I was struggling to realize that functions are usually called to "return" rather than "print" something. Thanks for everyones help!

Hi, I kind of did something similar using DASH https://plot.ly/products/dash/ . I created a web app running on pythonanywhere using dash, every time i select a criptocurrency name, a python script would run and show me the price on 3 Exchange in real time ; replace my script for a call on a dataframe object for example then a plot from dash and you would get what you want, I believe! You could check my web app if you want to, http://deepblueai.pythonanywhere.com It is in spanish tough, go to, where a dropdown menu is, and select a cripto, it should reply you with the % diference between exchanges. I am a noob in coding, but i was able to pull it off XD, so keep it Up!
Thanks! The main barrier for me is getting things to production... I can get them running on my computer but never live. Do you have any advice on crossing that gap?
I have a masters degree in electrical and computer engineering and I still don't know wtf that paper is about
It's a dimension reduction of a neural field model. Solutions of neural field models are classically infinite dimensional. If you know PDEs, you know that solutions are like a sheet deforming in time. One type of solution these field models produce are solutions with "bumps", where there is a well-defined centroid. We were able to reduce the model in this case to just the coordinates of the bump solution. From infinite dimensional to 2 scalar equations. The equations are delay equations and still infinite dimensional, but they happen to be amenable to classic dynamical systems theory. You can use stuff from 100 year old text books to analyze the reduced system and in turn learn about the original solution.
oh, yes, of course :-|
Skimming through that paper made me realize how inadequate I am in what ever that paper represents or even means. I don’t think I am qualified to give you a congratulations...but take one anyways!
I think the jargon really obscures the message. The target audience is pretty specialized. So believe me when I say you are more than qualified to understand the concepts :)
Thank you!
Not dumb at all. I'm really impressed that you are thinking about this. Here is another explanation: solving the equation is no problem for a computer. We know how they do it, we can sometimes do it by hand. But what this equation represents is a bunch of neurons arranged on a grid, and you can think of the z-axis as plotting neural activity. The peak of the bump represents a small region where the neural activity is very high. Sometimes, you can modify the equation and the bump will move around. Biologically this can happen in the hippocampus when an animal is keeping track of something that's moving in space. In fact the nobel prize recently went to a neuroscience group that found cells that do just that. The goal of the paper was to write down the position of the peak neural activity. Since the neurons are arranged on a grid, you expect that you would only need 2 coordinates to track the peak. That is what we show.
That's fascinating. Like a good redditor I didn't read anything other than the comments! Thanks for your explanation.
I wouldn’t say it’s outright illegal, after all you are just reading what’s on a webpage and giving it some kind of structure. I would recommend you oooking into the scrapy framework for python, it is somewhat big and with a lot of moving pieces, but once you got the hang of it it’s really nice what you can accomplish and extend in the future.

Thank you for your comment. I had to think about your question a bit, and I just want to say that good fucking god yes it is satisfying. I give credit to my advisor for figuring out a ton of clever tricks. I think my reason for satisfaction might be a bit different though. Once you reduce something down to something so simple it becomes much easier to understand what's happening. My monkey brain no like think.
Reducing the system in a neighborhood of a fixed point?
Congratulations!!
That's one of the things we do later on. In fact wherever you see "stability" in the paper I'm talking about exactly that. The reduction I mean in my comment above is different. It's about reducing a partial differential equation into a pair of delay differential equations. Once we have the delay differential equations, we start to look at linear stability of fixed points.
Thank you. Nice username. Snails are cool!

its not homework, but no problem just wanted some help on something im trying to make.
as i said, this is not homework. I'm trying to use this for something else im creating and im just new to python. Why is everyone here so aggressive...
Short answer, yes. It is ill advised. However, if you have some level of beginner-to-intermediate experience in programming, and can follow the logic, it will be easier to get into. You can jump right in, with both feet, but be prepared to learn programming along the way; whether or not you want to. There are some videos/explanations, that explain the gist of machine learning without programming ([Matt Parker's match boxes that play tic-tac-toe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9c-_neaxeU)). The video includes all the information needed to implement a rudimentary ML algorithm and this could be in any programming language. Consider this an exercise and find out how far you can get. You may get stuck, but you now know there is a solution. You can learn bit by bit this way. 
Oh I see, now it makes a lot more sense. Thanks!
I wrote it that way so people can understand what im asking. (What kind of homework assignment needs you to code anyways). Could you just answer one question, do I use a while loop for this, because i've been trying to do it without one and I feel like i'm missing something. Can I post the code I have here?
Try /r/learnpython.
As a non-expert, I focused just on the graphics (what you highlighted in the post title). They are very clean and straightforward. Nicely done. A couple comments/suggestions: 1. Beware of font sizes on images once they are scaled to display size. Axes labels, ticks, etc., like those in Fig. 1 can be harder to read than they need to be. Some techniques exist like [this one](http://bkanuka.com/articles/native-latex-plots/) to render out LaTeX plots via matplotlib, so your figures will appear seamless within the document. I've written my own wrapper class that I call instead of pyplot that gives me the right look and feel regardless of \textwidth. Unfortunately, I cannot share it. 2. For plots like Fig. 3, are the magnitudes important? If so, they cannot be interpreted. I'd recommend other plots like imshow, contourf, contour, pcolormesh, etc. that project down to a 2-D plane and use color (and/or labels) to indicate magnitude. 3. Beware that Python's default colors for line chart's aren't ideal from a colorblindness perspective. In particular: Figs. 4,5. You might consider an alternate palette that is "colorblind friendly" like [this one](http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=qualitative&amp;scheme=Paired&amp;n=4). I also like to check for reproducibility in black and white (e.g., Figs. 2,17 are **very** hard to read). Consider different line sizes and/or opacities and greater contrast in the colors. It's not as easy to check, but colorblindness simulation tools also exist such as [this one](http://www.color-blindness.com/) or [this one](https://github.com/jkulesza/peacock) that can be used to check for that. 4. As noted, Fig. 17 suffers from serious contrast issues. Fig. 18 is better, but rather than black and grey, what about black and black dotted or red and blue (with the red dots then going to black)? 5. Go Pitt! I hope these thoughts are compelling.
There's all kinds of tutorials in the sidebar. They're all pretty good.

1: learnpython 2: you won't get any help unless you tell us what you've tried and what happens when you try it.
Is this something I need to define in the matplotlib options?
Thanks for your comment. 1. The figures in this file are pngs and are thus pretty awful compared to the actual version where the figures are all in pdf format. The text shows better, however your observations on poor contrast are valid. 2. The magnitude is not important 3. Your point is valid and an oversight on my part. Fortunately, the target audience should be able to deduce which curves are which. But again, I agree the color choices could be much better. The reader should not have to go through any sort of deduction. I'll bookmark the tools you linked. I only have one reference for picking colorblind-friendly colors, and it really isn't enough. 4. Agreed. I chose solid black and gray because it's the standard choice for these types of plots, but the contrast is awful. This paper went through a long review process and I'm not to keen on making any more edits, but I'll keep your points in mind for future reference. Thank you for your very valuable feedback.
This is awesome! Do you know of a quick way to filter out artists? There are a few artists that I listen to only while falling asleep and they are skewing my results.
Holy moly, 60 pages for a paper? I've seen masters &amp; PhD dissertations shorter than this. Is this number of pages normal for this journal? Congrats on the paper it's a big achievement to get past the peer reviews! 
This is possibly one of the worst posts in /r/Python history. Firstly, you've posted in the wrong sub. But even if you posted in the CORRECT sub you still wouldn't get an answer as you don't even describe your issue. 
Yeah, favorite languages should be regarded more like favorite fountain pens. There's no objectively correct answer. Except Haskell. Fight me.
~~U~~ F Edit: sorry wrong layout.
Are you Brad or... 박영민씨인가요? Congratulations! Also did you write the paper in LaTex? I love that your figures have tick marks inside with mirrored edges, that's my preference also.
Say you have a list of whatever. That list is actually a collection of objects. Doing print(*yourlistnamehere) just prints them all out in order.
I think im more confused sir ....
Just remember everything is an object. A list of variables is really just a collection of objects. That’s what the documentation was trying to say. Kinda confusing sure but you’ll get it eventually. 
&gt; Thanks for your comment. No problem. Again, excellent work! &gt; This paper went through a long review process and I'm not to keen on making any more edits Nor should you make these type of edits at this point. The content and drawn conclusions are correct. These are merely refinements (and meant for anyone to consider as they prepare work in the future). A side comment though: in fields like this reviewers seldom care about presentation (i.e., accessibility and ability to clearly display data without biasing the reader). As such, I'm thrilled to see someone take pride in the entirety of his/her work and hope I can, even marginally, help them have an even greater impact going forward. &gt; I chose solid black and gray because it's the standard choice for these types of plots... These type of "standards" go along with my prior point (and may harken back to yesteryear when publishing gave you grayscale-only options). Hopefully as a new generation of researchers come into technical fields they will keep a focus on quality work but also these other types of considerations to ensure the work can be interpreted easily and correctly. &gt; but I'll keep your points in mind for future reference. Excellent, that's why I wanted to share them. Clearly, you take pride in producing quality work so I thought you'd be interested in some additional thoughts to make it accessible to an even wider audience. 
You can use a boolean mask! Right before the `hits.index = hits[label]` line in the `chart` function, add this: if label == 'artist': hits = hits[hits['artist']!='Enya'] hits.index = hits[label]
Those figures look nice, looks like you put alot work into them
I think it would be so much easier to go through the Github repo if the repo is organized into directories. Perhaps all the data in a `data/` directory.

You don't have to put yourself down because you don't understand something that you're not an expert in. As a PhD student in biophysics, I don't understand the paper as well. I'm sure that my MIT educated boss won't make any sense out of that paper as well. That's how it is in academia. People often don't understand things outside their area of expertise, sometimes even papers written down in their own field.
So I'm never really sure whether *dataflow* is a consistent or meaningful concept. So you might want to clarify what you feel dataflow gives you. Sometimes I feel there's a bit of "look a network" or "look pictures" without this actually meaning anything. In the interests of giving you some more "concrete" concepts I'm going to throw some keyword soup at you :) Here are some concepts related to data flow programming: * Broadcasting (see numpy), and point free programming (this is what a number of your tools seems to be addressing ... although some of them seem to only deal with *pipelines* (e.g. each unit has a single dependency and a single output) * Functional reactive programming (the aim here is to kind of get you language / libraries to deal with connecting up your program) * Actor / agent based models. The data flow you describe kind of determine which bits of the program depend on one another so is a good way of allow things to run in parallel see Erlang for an example of this. * Dependency trees. This is very much related to functional reactive programming, but you have things like makeo * Modularisation / Domain specific languages part of the purpose of drawing this dataflow is clear identify which variables depend on one another and store this in one place (separately from the hairy details of calculation). It isn't particularly difficult to do this in code (although the separation may not be enforced very well), or a very simple DSL (which is effectively what 
It's called a `splat` and it can be used to expand a list (or iterable) into an outer list context Here's some examples &gt;&gt;&gt; def add_three(a, b, c): ... return a + b + c ... &gt;&gt;&gt; add_three(1, 2, 3) 6 &gt;&gt;&gt; nums = [1, 2, 3] &gt;&gt;&gt; add_three(nums) Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; TypeError: add_three() missing 2 required positional arguments: 'b' and 'c' &gt;&gt;&gt; add_three(*nums) 6 &gt;&gt;&gt; [0, nums, 4, 5] [0, [1, 2, 3], 4, 5] &gt;&gt;&gt; [0, *nums, 4, 5] [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
cool, i'll discuss it in a journal club I go to with some people who know Bard.
Some highlights that come to mind: 1. Continuous web scraping done via cron to acquire some data and send it to me if it passes some test. Recent ones were: (1) Scraping a restaurant's web site to see when they'd reopen and texting me the date; (2) Scraping a university web site to identify room number for a meeting when posted. 2. Identifying duplicate files with os.walk and the filecmp module. I had tons of older backups that were merged (and some even had their filenames replaced with junk) together, so this saved plenty of time. 3. Organized contacts from different phones/apps to consolidate them. 4. Go through several old spreadsheets containing workout logs to consolidate data and generate statistics/visualizations (pandas and matplotlib). Fairly simple tasks, but the Python multipurpose utility knife slices through them nicely. 
If your paper is accepted for publication, you should be careful of sharing a manuscript or preprint; you should have already signed over copyright to the journal and may be violating their copyright by sharing a PDF now.
Plus `aList` is unnecessary. 
Scraping my sons student portal to send me his grades and missing assignments, daily. 
What exactly is the error you are getting? 
I have a shitty car USB radio transmitter which is able to play songs only in alphabetical order, while I want random order. So I use a simple python script to rename all songs on a flash drive to something like "0023.mp3" and another script to restore the initial folders and names (which I store in a pickled dict on the drive). I've also used Python to download some webcomics.
Well that doesn't really answer the question :P (at least not without a bit of digging). Let's have a look at what the framework does: The [basic use case](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/overview.html#walk-through-of-an-example-spider) * Replaces `urllib.open(start_url)` with `start_urls =` * Replaces `lxml.HTML` with `def parse(self, response)` * Replaces `next_page = start_url; while next_page:` with `response.follow` * Adds an implicit `json.dumps` I'm not sure how valuable this is. The big win I guess is turning "the act of a scraping a single page" into data, which can then be reused by surrounding tooling. I'm not sure how much additional tooling there is. Going through [the features](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/overview.html#walk-through-of-an-example-spider) &gt; Built-in support for selecting and extracting data from HTML/XML sources using extended CSS selectors and XPath expressions, with helper methods to extract using regular expressions. Provided by [lxml](http://lxml.de/) &gt; An interactive shell console (IPython aware) for trying out the CSS and XPath expressions to scrape data, very useful when writing or debugging your spiders. [ipdb](https://github.com/gotcha/ipdb) &gt; Built-in support for generating feed exports in multiple formats (JSON, CSV, XML) and storing them in multiple backends (FTP, S3, local filesystem) `json.dumps`. I don't imagine using `S3` directly is particularly difficult. &gt; Robust encoding support and auto-detection, for dealing with foreign, non-standard and broken encoding declarations. This is potentially valuable &gt; Strong extensibility support, allowing you to plug in your own functionality using signals and a well-defined API (middlewares, extensions, and pipelines). The extensibility is largely *necessitated* by the use of a framework settings. Short sections of code written in python are very very extensible. &gt; cookies and session handling `urlib` &gt; HTTP features like compression, authentication, caching `urlib` &gt; user-agent spoofing `urlib` &gt; robots.txt https://github.com/seomoz/reppy &gt; crawl depth restriction Three lines of code &gt; A Telnet console for hooking into a Python console running inside your Scrapy process, to introspect and debug your crawler Potentially valuable I can't find nice code for this outside of another framework. &gt; Plus other goodies like reusable spiders to crawl sites from Sitemaps and XML/CSV feeds Useful.. although these can be run separately without your scraper itself being written use scrapy. &gt; a media pipeline for automatically downloading images (or any other media) associated with the scraped items, a caching DNS resolver, and much more! This seems valuable. The built in DNS resolver is already caching. ------ I'm still unconvinced that placing your code in the strictures of this framework provides sufficient value to justify its use, though there may be some killer "scraper as a data file". There might be value within the context of a large number of people working together (e.g. a company). I would be more inclined to do things with *protocols* rather than frameworks. I remain to be convinced though.
I appreciate it! Thank you! I thought it could based on my research but wanted to ask for a definite answer. Thank you again!
Go to torrents, sort by seeds, and download all the videos on LaTeX you can find. Knuth must be very popular because there are so many videos, you will learn so much!!
If you want to start a business, learn how to run business, not how to develop software applications. Optionally, if you have a great idea for a product, and have some PoC for that (or even better working version of it), than you can look for investors, gather a team and run a startup.
Cool! That sounds a bit like how particles in quantum field theory works as well. Based on my [youtube education in quantum field theory](https://youtu.be/bG-xu5H6plk).
1/2: You need to import the modules in both files. You can think of modules like scopes. There are cases, though, where you don’t need to import. Lets say module A has a function which takes a datetime as imput. As long as you don’t need to create a new datetime or timedelta, then you don’t need to actually import datetime in the file where the function is defined. You can think of imports as something that just creates an object for you with the name of the module you’ve imported. It actually does execute any code defined outside of functions when you import a module, but like I mentioned above, imports will stay in the local scope. 3/4: The global variables will be bound to the module that you import. Let’s say that in module A you have a global variable named foo, then you access it with “A.foo”. Likewise, if you have a module B with the same variable name, “B.foo” is accessible as well, and it is different from “A.foo”. If you do “from A import *”, then it populates your local scope with the variables defined in the module. If you then do another star import, it will override any variables / functions that share the same name. The scope is actually a dictionary that you can access with locals() and globals(). What an import does is populates these dictionaries, and if the key already exists it overwrites it. 5: Yes that is what classes are for, and I would suggest learning about them, because there are very powerful. Let me know if you have any questions. I’m currently sitting in an airport, so I can give you some example code in a couple of hours when I get back. Also, next time you should probably post to /r/learnpython. :)
I can recommend you this library made by Erik Cederstrand: https://github.com/ecederstrand/exchangelib I used it to scrape mails and create tickets from them. Have fun! ;-)
If you search for "Python language translation" you will find several modules that provide interfaces to various web translation APIs. (Mainly Google's.) If you actually want to understand how machine translation works by implementing your own translator, that is a noble goal. I would probably try to find an online machine learning course that covers language translation. There are tutorials online, too. If you are struggling in Python and Latin courses in school, and you had the idea that you could kill two birds with one stone by learning Python and using it to pass your Latin course, well... Here is a not-serious answer to this question (not my code, haven't tested it): https://gist.github.com/kappter/9936137
Well at the moment nothing, but the main feature it is going to have is verification and keeping track of users. I will add more to it once I have that done.
The pythonic way doesn't put emphasis on shortness (one liners) but rather on readability, reusability and maintenabily. As someone said, if you are at your smartest when you write code, how are you going to debug it? I am sure it will click in you in time as it is a common reaction to be in awe for the compactness that python allows, but please bear in mind that good python should be almost undistinguishable from plain English. If you start losing than in a long chain of methods that call the result value without intermediate steps, I don't think that's not good python. Have fun! 
Let me quote from the ending of the Abstract: &gt; ... Mexican hat type in addition to a smooth firing function. Obviously this paper is about cartel wars in South America.
Hi, I wrote that article "New interesting data structures in Python 3", but you've also linked to some Rezha Julio, who has just stolen it, without any attribution to me. Could you change his link to [my original article](https://github.com/topper-123/Articles/blob/master/New-interesting-data-types-in-Python3.rst)?
You're right, codewars is not about writing maintainable code but still, I've learned a lot about what is _possible_ using this language. And I think this could be important when it comes to write code in production.
Great to see more people taking point 1 into account. It makes the paper so much more pleasant to read if figure font sizes are actually large enough to be readable, as well as consistent between figures. 
I don't think so, you are thinking on how fast you can prototype something but you are not worrying about the performance of things, python can be quite slow.
&gt; I am not an expert at the underlying logic so maybe that it how it works for some iterators Not in the standard library, AFAIK. `iter()` has a fallback for non-iterable sequences (object with `__getitem__` but without `__iter__`) and it doesn't query the length at all, [it just calls `__getitem__` repeatedly with increasing integers until it gets an `IndexError` (which it converts into a `StopIteration`)](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/2ebc5ce42a8a9e047e790aefbf9a94811569b2b6/Objects/iterobject.c#L65).
can we get the clean, final version of this code so I can see how it's done properly? I'm still a bit lost as to what indentation mistakes are messing me up. I often end up in these seemingly endless loops.
I'm gonna assume you made a file called 'Queue.py' in the root of your project.
I work at McDonalds and I still don't know wtf that paper is about
You can SSH into your desktop computer from your laptop (or even your smartphone). It doesn't come with a graphical interface but it is faster than TeamViewer. There is plenty of good tutorials available for Windows, Mac and Linux.

Perf is another story. Maybe my approach is wrong, but I think one should know a language inside and out before doing perf optimization.

elif is only run if the if above it is false. So if there are 10 ifs they will all be checked, but if there is one if containing 9 elifs and the third one is true then the other 6 won't be checked, saving time and cpu usage.
elif is basically just another if inside the else branch. So in an if / elif / else, first the if condition is checked, and if it holds, then only the first block is executed. Otherwise, the elif condition is checked, and if that holds, then only the second block is executes. Otherwise, the third block (after the else) is executed. The reason you use elif over plain if is that in order to achieve the same effect with plain ifs, you would have to put the second if inside the else branch of the first; it works, but it adds one extra nesting level for each additional condition, so if you have a series of 10 conditions, then you would be indenting 10 levels deep. Using elif, no nesting is required.
Efficiency is not the only factor. If the conditions being checked are not mutually exclusive, if and elif will produce a completely different result. OP: please post questions like this to /r/learnpython . `elif` is equivalent to `else: if`. if tuesday: print("It's Tuesday") if raining: print("It's raining") ...will print `"It's Tuesday"` if it's Tuesday and then print `"It's raining"` if it's raining, regardless of whether it's Tuesday. These are two completely independent `if` statements. if tuesday: print("It's Tuesday") elif raining: print("It's raining") ...will only check if it's raining *if it isn't Tuesday*. If it is Tuesday, only the Tuesday message will be printed. This is *a single `if` statement*, with an additional `elif` condition. It's equivalent to: if tuesday: print("It's Tuesday") else: if raining: print("It's raining") The point of `elif` is to compress `else: if` together without having to increase the indentation; something which becomes more important as you have more conditions in your ladder: if A: do_a() else: if B: do_b() else: if C: do_c() else: ... # keep increasing indentation for ever This is a mess. The outer `if` can only have one `else`, so if you want to do something if neither A nor B are true you need to add an `else` to the inner `if`, and so on. But you can chain as many `elif`s as you want at the same level, so you can convert that to if A: do_a() elif B: do_b() elif C: do_c() elif: ... # stay at the same indentation level

It is wrong. You get the bad habits and it's hard to fix them later. 
Just set up a custom formatter in the standard `logging` module, or, if you're lazy, use [coloredlogs](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coloredlogs).
Have you heard of premature optimization? ;)
That looks dope. Good job.
I was always really unhappy with the Python options for dynamic systems. XppAuto seemed to do a ton of cool calculations but is mainly a GUI, and the documentation for PyDStool was pretty hard to navigate. Are things any better these days?
Amen ;)
It's quite straightforward to use locally (if you have lots of cores in one machine), you can just launch the "cluster" like this from the shell: ipcluster start --n=8 # For 8 workers How you set it then up for a cluster will depend on what kind of cluster you have. If your machines are all accessible via ssh and share a file system (e.g. through NFS), then it's "fairly trivial" (or it was last time I used it!!). [Here](http://astropython.blogspot.co.uk/2016/02/how-to-setup-ipython-parallel-cluster.html) is a fairly recent guide to setting this up.
Thanks for helping me in Brent’s class
Wait a second, that's amazing. I can see this being applied to diagnosing NN issues. Anything that makes NNs less of a block box can only be a good thing.
Nice! I've spent a while trying to improve IPython startup time (it's still pretty bad, but it's been worse), so I'm excited to see that Python 3.7 will make this easier to test. One trick I like to do is to [simulate a cold start](https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Cold-start-simulator) to get an idea of the worst case performance. If I do that on a machine with a spinning hard drive, importing `pkg_resources` can take about 5 seconds.
Haha. You're welcome.
Are you seriously going to post this every day?
Why do you want Yahoo Emails? It sounds like you need a more professional option. Buy a domain with email.
I was concerned about this too! Figured you probably knew what you were doing; still, glad this got pointed out as guidance for others who may not be as aware of the potential perils of putting things in the public domain. Congrats!
Nice! Looks like latex. What format to you use for your figures? I assume pgf, eps, or PDF.
Nice. Where do you work?
Hahaha. Ill make sure my future papers dont have an accidental matlab code
You're trying to read a byte response. But you shouldn't do that by just taking away `b[..]` from the string representation. If you like to get the content from a http request via urllib you should decode it properly from urllib import request response = request.urlopen("http://google.com") encoding = response.info().get_content_charset() bytes_content = response.read() string_content = bytes_content.decode(encoding or 'utf-8') # I'm not entirely sure if encoding can be None... print(string_content)
Thanks! Yes, latex. These figures are png (to fit arxiv size limits). The final published version will use pdf figures.
Write the one that produces the code you can more easily write and maintain. Are you really worried about a small percentage performance difference with this project? If you are, maybe use Java or Go?
I think you raise some valid points. In my case, I started scrapping using beautiful soup, selenium, and phantom js. Even though I did get the data I set out to get, I was sure that my code was not extensible. I’m not saying that’s because of the tools, but having a middleware pipeline, dns, outputters and auch built in sure is nice. Even more so if I take splash in consideration (a companion library to scrapy used for cases where JavaScript is required for instance). Maybe for one time scrappings it’s overkill. Scratch that, it IS overkill. However when working with more than 3 persons and having to run the scrapping process unattended 3 or 4 Times a day I think it’s quite nice. 
Just curious as someone who just started learning Django; how long have you been using Django? And how did you find that job?
Persimmons
How many years have you been studying to achieve this level of knowledge ?
Ah yes that size limit. I strongly recommend pgf. It allows latex to render the fonts as the document is compiled so everything is consistent. It's also a vector format so it might help with the size limits. Not sure how well it will work on your 3D plots.

This awesome and something that has been in my mind.. 
you got a github link? I'm a total python noob, haven't done any serious projects so far but am looking to do a discord bot at some point. Have little clue about that since I've been focusing or data analysis so far, looking to make a bot that analyses dota2 results pulled from an app and shit. 
Datacamp has some neat courses on python and pandas / numpy / data science bits in general. Some of the lessons free, some not, I personally feel it's worth the price and it's extra incentive to follow through with the lessons. Would wait til they have a sale though, you can get a yearly sub half price every now and then 
Wow that sounds awesome! How are you connecting to the interface? Does it have a built in way to download the data?
I evaluated nameko again, seems to be exactly what i wanted to do! thank you very much for the suggestion

Cool project. Copy pasta: https://zeevgilovitz.com/detecting-dominant-colours-in-python
At the moment it's not quite ready to release publicly, sorry. Maybe soon. Even if I did release it, it doesn't work. 
Which step is taking the bulk of the time. Reading the DB or processing it in pandas. Look to optimizing your mssql server. That's where any bottle necks would be. I had a similar situation in my scripts which came down from 3.5 hours to under 3 mins after optimizing the Postgres.
Restarting an ipython kernel is something I do so often I’ve just gotten used to it being slow :(
Use regular expressions. Also /r/learnpython
90% of the time is spent actually writing to the server. Each read takes only a couple minutes, the filtering only takes a couple seconds. How would I go about optimizing the server? 
If you ever write a CLI app or utility in Python you will understand.
"technologies, best-practices" is pretty broad. I suggest to learn and understand what you need in order to get the job done, that's all that matters. End users don't give a crap if you use Flask or Django under the hood, only the value that the final product brings matters. But, to get you a list of starting points, you could look into the things that you just mentioned and understand their purpose and the reason they were chosen. It's very important to understand what problems do they solve and what are the drawbacks.

Automate the boring stuff with python is a great book and i think it's for free ! 
Nice work! Beautiful figures.
nice job dude, welcome to the club my esteemed colleague! clean, great looking figs.
Congrats!
here is the official site : https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ but you can find PDFs online just google it.
Thanks for sharing this. I hope I will have time this weekend to get my hands dirty on this.
It hurts the brain.
Also a best practice in any language - don't put other languages down.
Permissions.
You have a lot of reading to do about the uses that Python gets put to.
A slight tangent but many people are aware that dataclasses were strongly influenced by [attrs](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs). However there is at least one alternative to attrs in [autoclass](https://smarie.github.io/python-autoclass/) which may interest some people.
I still don't see anyone would use dataclasses over attrs.org
Ha, like I said...very new to this. =D
Hot figures yo.
I just invested my life savings, so if this doesn't take off over night I'm burning down your house.
For the sake of conversation/learning.....Couldnt he run a loop, slice each row to look for a specific value within the log? What would be advantageous about using reg expression?
Are you sure python is the best platform for your use case? I think Spark is built exactly for your usecase and can run in parallel with streaming. 
Create backups of my open Firefox tabs. I'm a tabaholic.
I am unsure if I am writing with insert or update. I use the pandas command: df.to_sql(&lt;name&gt;, &lt;connection engine&gt;, if_exists = 'replace') My connection engine is: engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine("mssql+pyodbc://&lt;user&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@&lt;url&gt;/&lt;database&gt;?driver=ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server", echo=False) What is the advantage of writing to a temp table? wouldn't the theoretical write speed be the same whether the table is temporary or a permanent, already existing table? 
What exactly is the advantage of splitting into chunks? Say I have 10 records that takes 10 minutes to write. If I split it into 10 chuncks of 1 record each, why wouldn't each chunk take 1 minute and total to the same run time? 
There's a USB port that can be read from in real time if you know how to parse the datastream.
When can I buy it on Binance?
I read in your other comments that write speed are slow. What are the other servers? SQL or NoSQL? How do you write data? In batches or one by one? Spark is built for fast processing across multiple cores, CPUs, and servers. It runs purely in RAM and the syntax for processing data is built around Pandas dataframes. So, processing in Spark will be faster because the core functionality is optimized for processing humongous data. However, your case is different because you said write speeds are slow. Have you checked the connection between the processing server and the other server? Also the way you write data to the other server
That's awesome, glad your hard work is paying off! I'll have to look into the Django cms once I get further along
IMO page length is not so important. Sometimes you have more things to say, or it takes a lot to explain something simple. Be proud of your contributions!
Nice, that's cool that they have that built in. 
I assume you already know, but Micropython starts up REALLY fast. However it's a subset.
I, quite frankly have no idea because I'm not entirely familler with what you're doing. It may do nothing.
I write using the pandas to_sql function. Both the source of the original data and write location are MS SQL running on digital ocean servers. The script is run on a desktop in my office. 
What motivates you to learn Python and Django?
Ohhhhhhh.....
 "Uses that Python gets put to" - O'Reilly Media [cover image: animals entering Noah's Ark] &gt; Chapter 1: CLIs where startup speed is crucial &gt; ... mmm ... hmmm... oh? ah. hmmm. Reading's done, boss. TIL. 
To the moooooon!
What mints initial coins in the project?
My `$PS1` calls a python script so the answer, for me at least, is every time I hit enter in Bash. With that said, if I couldn't get it to be fast enough, I would be fine. I just have a few minor things I like in it.
Seems like an interesting and thorough write up. But, other than being filed in the "python" category of the (your?) site, it has **nothing to do with python**
I work in GIS and first learned python for automating geoprocessing tasks. I'm looking to move more into the development side of things, because that is what really excites me, so I have been working on increasing my python knowledge. Django just seemed really cool and is an in demand skill so I thought I would check it out. I have played around with Flask some but Django is a whole other animal! In general I'm just super excited about furthering my programming knowledge and seeing the things that I can create
First and foremost, **this belongs in /r/learnpython** ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- Second, as others have said, you are likely encroaching on an [XY problem](http://xyproblem.info/) example. What are you *really* trying to do? Third, There are various things you can do with regex and/or something like for k in ['[',"'"]: symbols = symbols.lstrip(k) but again, this is **very clearly** not the solution. Read the `urllib` response, convert it to unicode (if it isn't already), then, if it is JSON, use the JSON parser. For example, if you're string has a comma in it, it would have been cut and broken the string.
Add tab completion to that as well.
For now, they don't. You must add them by hand. I'm still working on a simple way of doing it. If you have any idea feel free to let me know.
So, about 18 pages per year? Not too bad, considering the topic. ;)

apparently I (we?) are not alone. I think mods should now ban these posts, linking to medium articles that say buy this course with a fake price discount and fake reviews with poor english. It would be interesting to try a classification algorithm on these as well since they share so many similar features.
No, that was actually the one thing that I never understood about other cryptocurrencies. I was hoping you could clear it up for me. ;)
Based on the existing replies - the problem is writing the data back. To determine what is a fast way of doing this, first need to understand how the data is moving around. 1) Getting the original data from SQL server into pandas DF. 20 tables, 10K's record, 12 columns - The server is bundling all of this up and returning it to you in a single block of data (or multiple if you have it broken out into individual table queries). Basically - the volume is handled in one big set. 2) Pandas calculations - not familiar how this works, but expecting it's being processed against the full set of data in one logical block/set. 3) Writing the data back out. Based on what you are saying and the " , if_exists = 'replace') " parameter of your df.to_sql line. This is handling the data a record at a time. The if_exists also implies that it is checking each record before it tries to update or insert the record. So if you have 10K records in you data frame - this would have 20K individual requests to the target SQL server. --- dexbg is on the right path on how to get this to run in minutes. That type of approach gets the new data onto the server quickly (one big set of data to load) and then does the updates locally (in terms of the target server). The updates he stepped through can be done for all of the records at once. Depending on your needs - the could possibly be simplified to delete all data from the prior run/version and just insert new records.
Well done. That's inspiring to someone like myself who would love to do what you do. Hopefully I'll be in your shoes someday !!!
I wrote it as a webapp and run it in WSGI so its always on standby. Loads slow but runs fast.
Shameless plug for point 1: https://github.com/masasin/latexipy It does this for you automatically, and you end up with the same font etc as well. I made it for my masters thesis.
If your destination server is not the issue then I'd consider looking closely at pandas: I've found it to be extremely slow at assembling records. Also, you could consider running processes in parallel - with the futures module this can be very little code.
Yeah, after cleaning it up a bit, and after it's been running for a while, I was considering trying to see if subreddit mods would have any interest in modding him. I could easily just auto-remove posts based on these parameters as well. I would also like to add a bunch of other spam detection too. The more I dig into Reddit affiliate spam, the more I see how extensive it really is. Pretty nuts!
Oh shit, how long has the snap been available?! Updating has always been a hassle on linux (rename old install, download, extract, copy, possibly change permissions). It's the main reason I ended up getting Toolbox.
Lambos all around. I expect SimpleCoin to be $1000 by the end of year. Just put a mortgage on my house/car/dog/wife and sunk it all into SimpleCoin. Already on HitBTC, expecting for it to be on KuCoin, Cryptopia, and even Coinbase in a month.
I suspect some people out there right now wouldn't get the sarcasm take this at facevalue :|
Play mmorpgs for me and i also sell those bots
I might be off here but I don't believe that your issue is related to pandas or SQLAlchemy. I think your problem has something to do with connection. I would test three things to be sure that the script is the problem: 1. Run your script from the server that you write the data to. 2. Create another droplet and run your script in DO network. 3. Check your write server logs and see how many requests are being made to the server. Maybe you have some DDOS blocker in your machine for public connections. Let's say that you have 100k records that needs to be processed. Pandas sends data in chunks of 50 records per request. This means you send 2000 requests in couple of seconds. Your server thinks that this is some kind of DDOS attack, and slows down the connection. You end up waiting for hours to send the data.
It looks like Python 3 support was added a few weeks back. Now, Colab supports both Python 2 and 3. See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46941308/python-3-support-in-googles-colab/46941325#46941325

&gt; I can deny them access to the bot if they are obviously using cracked software. If your program gets cracked, they can patch out the server check just as easily as the rest of your protection. Also keep in mind that what you're doing may or may not be illegal.
Hey! thanks for your feedback! this means a loooot to me, it's nice having someone w/ experience review my work and all. I've made the changes you showed me and im continuing to add onto this program as I learn more and more.
The game is abandonware and the people behind it are old players that use stolen server software. I think just knowing who is using the bot gives me enough info to know that it has been cracked. Do you know of any good libraries for communicating with a server in this way?
My point is that if your bot is important or useful enough to be cracked, people will remove the part of it that sends the heartbeat and you will never know they're using it.
Just use Flask on the server and Requests on the client. Make an HTTP request every 5 minutes or something.
Thanks so much, I don't know how it is possible that I didn't find this earlier.
Fair enough you have a point, just wanted to push the discussion. 
Thanks for the reply. First, my understanding of if_exists is that it check if the table name exists. I do not think it check individual records for whether to replace or append them. I did suspect my slow write speed was due to a chunk/batch size issue. I tried testing this theory buy writing a random dataframe to the server using chunck sizes 10, 100, 1000, and undefined and each had the same run time. 
Keeping up to standards includes providing constructive criticism and feedback in a way to help someone learn and get better next time. Using degrading, personal insults that have nothing to do with the theory being discussed is immature. The article and her comments obviously show how excited and positive she is. If you feel your python knowledge could help the quality of the article (even though a perfectly written script doesn't change the article's exploratory purpose), why don't you reach out to her and provide suggestions instead of personally attacking her over semantics.
also just saw your username, haha huge fan btw. I often recommend your django youtube courses to anyone/everyone. 
Mark Zuckerberg tweeted that it will be added to Coinbase soon.

Convince people of this and you've got a classic pump and dump
&gt; One problem I have with splitting my code across several documents is that I have global variables like lists and dictionaries I need to be able to reference outside of a function i'm importing. So for beginners, I'd recommend never using global variables (other than imports, which I recommend). Just pass them into the function. Your code will be so much more robust. You can do things like: def run(): print('x = ', x') if __name__ == '__main__': x = 10 run() So obviously, if we call the file directly, x=10, but if we import run, you'll get an error because x is not defined. It's this specific issue that you want to avoid.
Bro, don't insult me like that. I ain't no CryptoNick 🔥🔥🔥
I get the same impression, based on what OP has written here. One more piece of information might be helpful: are there any indices o the target table. That can slow down inserts massively. Also, locking may play into the speed. So i‘d play with the transaction types etc. In general though, inserting data is always going to be somewhat slow. For that reason, most database systems provide a bulk load tool. How many records are you writing? Are you just doing insert, or are you expecting the database to update already existing rows? Can you get performance stats from the server?
I'll take a look at this this weekend, thanks a lot for sharing your work :)
Thanks! I was able to use that to filter out those artists. I found that if I added the filter lines between the hits = df[cols].copy() and if label == 'song': lines that it would remove those artists from all the charts. I am going to have to play around with this some more, thanks again!
i recently started focusing on python recently. it is ...just ... so readable...
Erm... https://github.com/cosme12/SimpleCoin/blob/master/simpleCoin/wallet.py#L72
Idk how advance you're with python and data science, but i'm doing the [python for data science and machine learning](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/) from Jose Portilla. This course is really awesome for people who know the basics of python (it's really all that you need).
Ahh haha. Dont worry. It was just for debugging in a local server. Nice spot btw!

I've checked the TA. Expect the new flippening by midnight. 
Would [recordtype!](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/recordtype/) qualify for this purpose?
There's a website in my country where you can find people near you who are selling used or unwanted stuff. They upload a few pictures, put a price &amp; leave their contact information – simple as that. Most items are barely working and some are just scams, but I often find some unbelievable good trades – I bought a Magic Mouse 2 &amp; a Magic Keyboard 2 for only $30, and the guy had never even used them. But why would I search through the website everyday to find good trades? Python can do that for me. So that's what I'm working on. I list a few keywords for things I'm willing to buy, a cron job scraps the website every 8 hours filtering low-price trades, and every now and then I get to spend less money on stuff I want. – Right now I'm improving the way it sees an ad as good or bad.
Nobody cares about Odoo spam
I’m switching from the advertising field and I am finding Jose Portilla’s python boot camp to be a great course. I would recommend it! 
If at the end of processing data in pandas you've got a lot of volume and aren't running many vectorized processes, aren't reducing it much, but rather writing it all out - you're probably better off (performance-wise) not using pandas.
You should get this straight to market, ASAP. The people over at /r/CryptoCurrency are already talking IPO here.

Nice work. Good to understand basic of blockchain. Maybe try to turn it into PyCoin? haha
Amazing
i'll have to try this out. i had an idea for a "pseudocurrency" that would be tied to a particular application, but not traded against cash or cryptocoins, kind of a "local currency" used within instances of the app. every time i tried building code for it using ports of bitcoin code, etc... it either refused to build, or if it worked, wouldn't make a genesis block. question: since this is a python script, then is it possible to run multiple instances of this on one machine, and so the whole mining network would be "self contained" on one machine? for instance, i would edit the code, so it would be making, let's say, unclejedcoin, and have 3 nodes running in terminals on the same machine mining UJC. this definitely looks like a fun project 
Thats how I tested it. Just make sure to change the localhost:port 
Yes it is, I've first come across it in a paper where they mathematically model the sloshing of jet fuel in the fuel tanks located in the wings. 
I write a program that will spin up 8 python processes to do some parallel computations. Those computations will take about 5ms/ea, but when the new processes boot there's a cool 10 second hang while they handle imports, etc. Improve bootup time for that "application" would be great.

Thanks! I discovered something called [the Pete Plan](https://thepeteplan.wordpress.com/the-pete-plan/) and wanted to program it in alongside the HIIT routine I like (5 min warmup, then six sets of {30 all-out row-sprint, 60 second slow}, and then a 5 min cooldown). Now I have a Raspberry Pi with this cool 7" touchscreen sitting at my rower that will tell me exactly what to do and how much of it I have left to do. They can be HIIT laps, distance laps, time laps, time based on the length of previous laps, etc. I've got it stable now, but now that I'm actively using it every workout, I'm thinking of things that'd be nice to have. Next steps are running reports on the data.

This would benefit from a brief explanation of what fuzzing is *before* diving into downloading dependencies. Also, on that point, I'd feel this would be much better starting from first principles (ie not having dependencies) and then introducing helper abstractions later, as at the end of the tutorial the tutee hasn't written a fuzzer, they've written a bit of glue that leverages a fuzzing library.
Yep, i need get some information from game with memory read ? like CurrentHP , Current Level etc...

Not going to try typing all those names, but assuming that **project** is either a) already in a directory on your PYTHONPATH, or b) it's in the current working directory in which you launch Python, then with this structure: project/ project/__init__.py project/module.py project/package/ project/package/__init__.py project/package/submodule.py Then **module.py** can access **submodule.py** either as an *absolute import* relative to the top-level package: from project.package import submodule Or as a *relative import* relative to itself. from .package import submodule The first is somewhat more brittle if **project** was ever renamed or **module.py** *and* **package** were ever moved together, the second is more brittle if there moved within **package** but relative to each other. BTW, I would never name a module **break**... it would conflict with the *reserved keyword* that exits loops, and you shouldn't even be able to import it.
Yes, but the article covers only built-in modules
I took "student" as in "college age", that's why I asked. Now I understand.
Seriously?! Nice! Finally I can scrape. Hate those dynamic JavaScript pages.
Nice, man! You should think about using the `cmd` module for wallet.py, will look much cleaner and will help you with testability and stuff. 
I want to write my first Gui now, too, and I am disappointed how the libraries are not being developed and how bad everything is documented. I wish I was good enough to write my own
Right.
A general solution that works well for CLIs is to import modules on demand. There's a package pulled from the Mercurial codebase that does this: [demandimport](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/demandimport/0.3.4).
I'm taking a python intro for this spring semester—my first time doing anything like this. The prof helped us set up, walked us through making a simple unit-converter, and told us to experiment this week. Experiment i did. I'm making a program that has a basic conversation with the user. So far, it looks like this: * asks who's there * pulls out a name from the input using some regex * asks how the user is feeling * does some more regex to pull out a feeling word * identifies the feeling as either positive, negative, or neutral * responds accordingly and asks for more details * says "bye [name]!", which can also be triggered at any point by typing "bye" or "goodbye" There's probably a lot I'm doing wrong or over-complicating, but I'm having fun, which I guess is what matters this early in the game.

You try your hand at creating your own ERC-20 token.. I haven't tried working with Bitcoin's code (though I have successfully created a token with under said protocol), but from what I've heard, Ethereum is much easier to work with (esp if you're just making an in-app token)
I have also been playing about with a self-made blockchain and I used gossip for peer discovery. I guess there is a python implemention you can just plug in. Might be worth a look.
Just use JetBrain's Toolbox app, it works perfectly on Linux and macOS
Have you tried [Kivy](https://github.com/kivy/kivy) ? If you have such trouble to develop a GUI with Python, it's maybe because Python is not the right tool for this, and you should pick a more suitable language ? &gt; Don't even get me started on deployment... Same remark here, Python is a scripting language and trying to deploy it as a Windows executable is a bad idea because it hasn't been built for this purpose. You don't try to cook a pizza with a washing-machine, and it is the same with programming language ;) 
I used wxpython for some small/medium projects a fee years ago and was pretty happy. Not sure what the current situation is.
My condolences. At least I know to stay away from Tkinter. GUI is also almost never fun (and one reason why I think Electron is so popular). It sucks in for example C#, but at least you have async/await to avoid blocking the UI thread. But even then, you can only run the UI in one thread. And honestly, WPF/XAML isn't what I would consider fun. I'd honestly like to know a good experience with desktop GUI development, because it seems to suck everywhere.
You could put all your code in a separate module and call it from your script file... That way you only have a NN with only 2 lines of code! /s
what advice are you looking for? For simple scrape or if you want to build everything yourself: * Beautifulsoup with request. If you want a scrape framework: scrapy, lots of options and howto's. If you need to scrape a page that is partly rendered by javascript you can use Selenium to preload the page, after that you can use selenium for basic scraping or pass the html sourcecode to beautifullsoup or scrapy. If you have specific questions, fire away. 
And Gio provides a large amount of async APIs out of the box.
Thanks, that makes it all clear.
Really cool
I'm trying to make hacking tools this weekend. Made a keylogger that sends me a mail everyday today.
Have you tried PyQt/PySide? I found it enjoyable to work with. The documentation, while all in C++, is excellent. Threading is also built into it so it isn't *too* hard to implement. PyInstaller works pretty well as deployment option. 
Python isn't a supported language for Android. There might be some third party tools to do it, but it would be much easier as a beginner to use the official supported tools. Android development is generally done in Java using the free Google supported IDE Android Studio
Stop preemptively babifying comments, no one is going to miss the joke here.
Wxpython has been through a bit of a rewrite. It installs from a whl which makes getting started a lot easier.
A lot of older modules are not that pythonic on the inside (look inside multiprocessing and weep). I demand libraries that work in virtualenv, from pip, on the gui front this means WxPython, PyImGui or Kivy. WxPython doesn't work in Pypy yet, PyImgui is starting to and I haven't tested Kivy.
Build great applications with it about 3 years ago, I can image those only got better!
Make sure you don't have two interpreters or venvs that share a name. Even if you are trying to use a different one, any name collisions elsewhere make it fail.
``` weather = "=== Weather Report ===\n" weather += "Location: ...".format(...) [...] return weather ``` or ``` return """"=== Report === Location: {location} Forecast: {time}""".format(location="Home", time="4:20") ``` or ``` return (" === Report ===\n" "Location: {loc}\n" "..." ).format(loc="in a galaxy far far away") ``` See multiline strings and /r/learnpython
Threading...Tk??
Pyqt5 is lyfe. 
I am sorry to say that, but you have no idea what you are doing. You can't manipulate same data from multiple threads simultaneously and expect it to work properly. Queues are not a workaround, queues are a way to communicate between threads. Also, threading with tkinter is not harder then any other gui lib, you can call your code on first frame from a timer and you have access to all the references.
&gt; Python isn't a supported language for Android. This is actually not true. CPython can be used with Kivy (or Pygame/Ren'Py) for creating Android apps. Then there's Jython, which runs on the JVM and should work fine with Android. 
Hmm didn't know that, but I don't see any names conflicts. 
Technically, all of this is actually feasible. You can obtain the current exchange rates from the Internet even using the standard library, and there are ways to port Python programs for Android. I'd suggest looking into Kivy. Or, if you are going to learn Java in the future, you can use that with Jython.
Using this logic I have a neural network without zero lines of code that's, my brain
Why is this not valued at $10k yet? /sarc
What I really meant was official, Google supported languages which I believe is only Java and Kotlin. It's doable but as a beginner it's probably easier to stick to Java as I don't really see the advantage of using Python for this application
Except his network is probably better at detecting diabetes than you... 
Lol,maybe....😂

Breathe, buddy. Breathe!
This argument is used a lot with various degrees of seriousness, but the important metric is "how many lines do *I* have to write, ab initio, to go from readily-available components to this application".
Also, what would be a good way to avoid IP ban? I plan to scrape this torrent site every 6 hours, 24x7.
Have to second this comment. Using the QThread system from the Qt application framework is fairly simple. I have used this extensively to allow my applications to execute long running tasks without blocking the main UI.
Electron is tempting because it is beautiful. A big part of the python’s problem is that it doesn’t look great... The hardest part about developing for TkInter is debugging. So many crashes go unreported. I couldn’t count how many times the UI would disappear and I would sit staring at a blank screen waiting for an error message. It took a LONG time for me to figure out my update limit workaround. It doesn’t scale up.
 print("Multiple of 3\t\tMultiple of 5") a, b, i = 0, 0, 1 while a &lt;= 100: a, b = 3 * i, 5 * i i += 1 print("{}\t\t\t{}".format(a, b if b &lt;= 100 else "")) I tried to think of better variable names for `a` and `b`, but couldn't come up with any good ones. This code does work, though it isn't particularly elegant. And probably not something you'd understand at first glance. 
We have to go with the shitcoin meme. Like: 1. Guy says: Ah, that shitcoin is only $0.001 - I'm gonna get some 2. Guy says: Hey that shitcoin is just $0.002 - better get in... 11. Guy: That thing is under $1...better get in... :)
My argument isn’t that these are the wrong ways to do it, it’s that there is no clear path for a beginner to learn it, and TkInter doesn’t scale. When you’re doing this for the first time, you don’t know where the “time to graduate to a better framework” line is, so you end up banging your head against a wall toward the end. Try clicking links of the [documentation wiki](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter). Half of them are dead, and the other half are so basic that they don’t ever make it to Threading.
Aww Thank a lot! This will greatly help me in understanding the basic
Whatever works for you. Just started with learnpyhtonthehardway...let's see if I stick with it this time around! :)
Flew over the text, didn't understand a word (besides the English)...you seem like a math god to me! Congratulations on getting accepted. What are you going to do now? Find a black hole? Or something else cool? :)
I guess you want to scrape from an ecommerce site. If you want to scrape data from a few pages (if you create a list by browsing a couple of websites manually) then use beautifoulsoup. You can set a scraper just by reading their documentation. However, if you need to scrape a large number of pages and you need to crawl to them from a given URL ( let’s say the homepage) then you should use scrapy. Scrapy takes a bit longer to set up, but you can set things like concurrency, threads and the most important: crawl depth level ( how many depths —pages the spider goes inside a website). If you need a few pages scraped (less than 50) just create a file.txt and use beautifoulsoup to loop and open them. If you want a more dynamic scrape, go for scrapy.
It’s either that, or one of the HTML alternatives for me going forward. When I started learning TkInter, reading C was a added complexity while I was still learning python... I’m still surprised how simple something like AppleScript &amp; Xcode was compared to python. It’s a little silly when you think about it from that perspective. 
Thanks! 
Absolutely, I’m just disappointed that the built-in offering was so bad. My expectation for python is, good documentation &amp; error reporting for fast debugging. TkInter is an exception to the python experience. 
use a monospace font? Like courier new
+1 for PyQt. By far the easiest, most mature, and most documented.
Nice. But specifying number of lines of codes is not important. I wanted to get into studying neural networks, and your video really good. Just waiting for your next video.

A bad workman always blames his tools.
I warned you it was silly. I don’t know why ASObjC exists but Apple made their scripting language (that no one uses) easier to develop for than python. I don’t know how I feel about that. 
Yea I have been using Pyqt5 over tkinter and its a lot more flexible and easy
Since your app will need access to the internet to determine the current exchange rate you know it will also have access to a web server. Save yourself some effort and use a web form to do the conversion. https://pythonspot.com/flask-web-forms/ 
You can add questions directly to input queries: word = input("Write a word with 'u' first letter")? Anytime something evaluates to true, you don't need to write == 'True' if word.startswith("p") also evaluates to True or False depending if it is true. word = peas word.startswith("p") is read as True word = goggles word.startswith("p") is read as False So we've got: word = input("Write a word with 'u' first letter") if word.startswith("p"): print('Nice') else: print("Noo") print(word.startswith("p")) Also check out r/learnpython for similar questions.
run explain plan on that
 print("nice" if input("write a word").startswith("p") else "nooo")
Thanks, you a lot! 
I see you're getting some slack on the lines of code. Honestly as someone starting to venture into neural networks. I thought it was great because it shows you can do something extremely cool with a small bit of code. Looking forward to the next video to learn the concepts a bit more. 
&gt; You don't try to cook a pizza with a washing-machine You'd probably use a dryer for a start. 
You can get anyone to do anything if you pay them enough. What are you trying to get?
What do you have in mind ???
hmmm guys can someone tell me how to open pycharm from termibal?? like we open visual studio code using 'code .' command ❤
No one in this subreddit will do it for free that's for sure. But everyone will be more than happy to help YOU write a scraper. Where's the data you need? What have you tried? Are you aware of https://scrapinghub.com/?
What exactly do you want to scrape on this site ??? 
Okay, i see. What would this cost me? Here is the site http://www.splitseasontickets.com/ I dont know how to do it. I am not a programmer.
Category data
&gt; You'd probably use a dryer for a start. That's my grandma's recipe ! More seriously, I trust you if you had good experiences with PyQT and Kivy ! Did you face the author problems with it ? 
1: /r/learnpython 2: you have you actually use it to retain what you're learning 3: biopython.org maybe
Okay thanks!
Isnt this outdated by now?
[ROSALIND](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/) is a great resource for learning Python and how to tackle common bioinformatics problems. Definitely worth checking out!
Definitely, [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) is great for stuff like this
I learnt c++ and am learning python (as a computer science major though). The thing I've learnt about retaining the info for me is you have to use it in a project that you care about. I remember a lot about c++ because I was in a project based class where the assigned projects were fun or useful. Python I'm struggling with cause I'm learning on my own and have only come up with one project so far
`selectolax` or `beautifulsoup4` and `selenium` if you need JavaScript parsing.

Thanks for making the video and sharing your code! It looks like Keras offers some similar functionality to TensorFlow. Shouldn’t you split the dataset and use a subset for training and a different subset to evaluate the model? Evaluating the model using the data that you trained it with would give you an inflated accuracy score; by definition you’ve trained it to recognise and classify the training data!
Seems to me that most of your complaints are GUI programing 101 (on any GUI Framework). The deployment part I agree.
The QT company is actively developing PySide2 and Riverbank is actively developing PyQt5.
I agree, when I was in the heat of development I was still learning python. You’re making me think: maybe my biggest complaint is with the documentation. They teach you a technique that quickly falls on its face. I wish they just started with a proper threading structure. 
www.pythonprogramming.net is where u want to be. Has basic and intermediate python syntax courses as well as data handling and statistical modeling courses.
I second PyQt/PySide, it's far easier to work with than Tkinter. WxWidgets is a close second. If you want to look at an example of multithreading execution in PyQt [I've got a short write up here](https://martinfitzpatrick.name/article/multithreading-pyqt-applications-with-qthreadpool/).
&gt; this seems really unpythonic and gets super unreadable. I get that you're making a hypothetical problem, but you came up with something that is inherently confusing without globals because you defined it to be confusing without globals. What is a real problem that you want to use global variables for? If you really need them, you should probably be using classes. If you don't, you make your function far more confusing and less useful. I used to put loggers in the global space. Then I started wanting to swap out the loggers. So now I make them class attributes where I can and pass them into functions when I need that.
You can use anything to write Python code. I like Visual Studio Code. Or just download PyCharm Community which is free.
Thanks. How is Visual studio code compared to Pycharm? 
I can do better: risk = 0.8 if nationality in ['American', 'British'] else 0.1 
There's a community (free) version available on their site. But all you really need to program using Python is a decent text editor like Sublime Text, textmate, notepad++, emacs, vim 
but... but this takes 30 lines of code to identify the diabetes. :(
I suggest if you're having this much trouble just install anaconda. It'll get you going easily
Haven’t watched the video (pls don’t give me shit for it), but with Keras it can actually shuffle and split the data for you).
line 3 doesn't do anything, just comment that out. I prefer: if word[0] == 'p': print("Nice") word[0] is the first character of the string word, word[1] is the second character, word[-1] is the last character.
There are several modules aimed at kids here: https://hourofpython.com/
In which case you might as well use [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which reports a minimal example of each distinct bug it finds. For pure-python code it even does better than random testing by watching the coverage profile of each example it tries and trying to explore your whole program! 
Hey pm, I'm interested
Lmao that's Pig Latin
The problem is that I use advanced custom fields for everything, it was a pipe dream and it crashed and burned because it is so slow at updating the database and making changes. My options are scrapping custom fields and either learning mysql or learning to manage the database AND do all my scripting in Python instead of PHP. 
You can run gimp headless and use gimp fu than way, with gimps python bindings. Start from there and build out.
&gt; Then I switch over to the command prompt and type in python, and no errors there. The guide says to run "$ python3" to start python 3 interpreter and it errors, underlining the "$" symbol and telling me that it's "invalid syntax". If you don't get any errors when you type `python` you've all ready got the interpreter, that's why `$python3` gives you the `invalid syntax` error.
There will not be a `python3` on Windows.
for the win! 
Did you google something like "vst plugins python"? I don't know anything about DSP, but the very first link I saw discussed the unsuitability of python for writing VST plugins.
You should pay better attention to signposts on your adventure. They're right over there in the sidebar. They'll point you to the right subreddit among other things.
Any that might be setup to only be visible in certain projects?
&gt; i'm hoping I can use html buttons/PHP to fire my Python scripts which can make changes to the DB. i do not know about your back-end, but a rule of thumb is to diagnose and understand the problem that causing your system to be slow (sql queries that may use a tune up, long running tasks, client side scripts, hosting or infrastructure issues...etc) and then take it from there. python is a great language, and there are many nicely written/ supported web frameworks, but so does php, some great websites are written in php, and believe me nothing magical will happen if you translate the code you have currently into python, changing x with y without understanding the real problem will just add complexity and may cause new problems. learn flask, it's a good start, and then try to implement what you have now in your php web app this may give you ideas along the way. if you identify any kind of issues, try to update your post to get better feedback.
&gt;&gt;&gt;There is no such thing as a random crash. Ever. All crashes are bugs, either in your code or the libraries you use. Uh, WRONG. Random crashes actually do happen, whether from "dirty" or inadequate power, or even cosmic rays: https://science.slashdot.org/story/17/02/19/2330251/serious-computer-glitches-can-be-caused-by-cosmic-rays Expecting the hardware to perform perfectly is the mark of an inexperienced developer. 
Out of curiosity, how is it outdated? Is there some other logger module that is supposed to supercede this?
I have no idea what i am talking about, i just looked at the year.
I also thought this was great. Really informative for a beginner like myself trying to understand neural networks and python in general. 
That should be a set, it's a bit faster, and elements are going to be unique. `risk = 0.8 if nationality in { 'American', 'British' } else 0.1`
Also a good idea. I have forgoted.
&gt; I thought it was great because it shows you can do something extremely cool with a small bit of code. It's just that lines of code is a weird metric, and people frequently abuse that in python by having a single line that's a 200 character list comprehension that nobody can understand.
No worries, it’s been pretty helpful. He likes that he receives an email so that he can be more proactive about following up with teachers on assignments.
Qt has QStyleSheets (QSS), which are modeled on CSS, so it can look however you want it to look. There's a bunch of dark themes around, for example: https://github.com/gmarull/qtmodern
Those are quite nice, thanks for the link. 
Hahaha :O
Check and search http://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=33
Yes.
I'm struggling to find reference for it, but I am fairly certain that `x in [l, i, s, t]` is O(n) where `x in { s, e, t, }` is O(1). Both check that `x == item` and `hash(x) == hash(item)`.
[removed]
Well that just depends on what you call a “line of code”.
There are a lot of gui libraries. Depending on your knowledge level, I would go with PyQt5. Although the official docs for QT are for c++, there are enough guides to get you started with python. If you don't really know much about c/c++, tkinter and Kivy have good resources online.
Thank you so much man. I Will try my best with IT 
For what it’s worth, you could certainly write your own simple neural network from scratch in Python in roughly the same number of lines of code with numpy. In fact it’s a rather enjoyable exercise. 
OOP is a concept, so you can learn it in pretty much any language and translate it to any other language that supports it. Sentdex on YouTube has some tutorials including OOP with python.
The pointless personal insults at her make any other suggestions from you sound defensive and not credible. Don't be a dick
Try /r/learnpython. Make sure you include what you have tried because per the sidebar: &gt;Posting only assignment/project goal is not allowed. Read posting guidelines.
My problem with starting is always the question of where. I never know what information to work with mainly because there is so much data available to play with. This looks like a really cool and simple starting point

i am working on web scraper for a client. Its intersting challenge because it has some javascript in it, and dynamic content. Since i am farly new programmer and generally new in python, i am not that fast with solving issues but he is how ive done things so far. using bs4 i managed to pull al the links for categories, and also using bs4 i pulled out all the links for products. Now, some products do have javascript dynamic pricing, for example you pick size, than price changes but others dont. Curently i am working on a loop that will separate products that have dynamic contest from the ones who dont. And after that if there isnt dynamic content, bs will do the tric, and if there is selenium webdriver chrome will do the trick. I wanned to use phantomJs but, i decided to go with mozzila webdriver since i can see whats going on. Cheers!

I found [this well-commented approach](https://databoys.github.io/Feedforward/) more readable.
I did a little test with timeit and list and sets were essentially the same time (maybe even a little faster for list) if nationality were set to the first item, American. However, if set to British the list example took longer while with the set version the time didn't change.
I mean php?
Python is not *the* bioinformatics language (R competes in a lot of applications, and hi-performance stuff still has to be C/C++), but it's a good one. The only way to learn stuff is to use stuff, so get into a bioinformatics group or start doing bioinformatics for a molecular biology lab. This way you'll have someone teach you what the bioinformatics is, how do you approach different problems, what are the caveats of different solutions, etc. First you'll probably find yourself writing tons of converters from FASTA to NEXUS to whatever obscure format this one tool uses. And about as many parsers for outputs, because JSON/CSV/XML is apparently not good enough for most bioinformaticians. Learn [biopython](http://biopython.org), it's your best friend. In a couple years or so you'll understand both the bioinformatics and programming well enough to start writing tools of your own. That's how I did it, at least. Learned Python from "Dive into Python 3", although that book is mostly for programmers in other languages trying to understand python, not for complete beginners. But anything will go: codecademy, check.io, any of the million Python books, you name it. What matters is that you should actually use it for actual science.
The big gulp I have every morning begs to differ. 
A better test would probably be to generate a bunch of random strings, select one at random, and then see how long it takes to look up using both methods. Averaging several runs of this would probably yield a better result than just selecting between two items. 
That sounds really silly and naive at the same time. First, you may too exaggerate attractiveness and quality of your work and thus trying solve a problem while missing the main point. Second, if majority of the code including anti-debugging and obfuscation is written in python, it becomes trivial to decompile and crack when (bundled) interpreter is required to run on. AFAIK all python implementations do not compile into an independent native machine code. I'd suggest write and publish for free some good and desired program to earn some confidence and appreciation. Only after that you may initiate some form of crowd-fund to finally get paid.
Python is certainly a good language for computational biology and bioinformatics. But as others have said, the best way to learn is by doing. A really great website is Python for Biologists (https://pythonforbiologists.com/introduction/). This shows you examples of how the code you are learning from codecademy etc is applied to problems. This can inspire you to start solving problems of your own creation. I also recommend checking out this blog (https://www.badgrammargoodsyntax.com/), which is aimed at biologists without any prior programming experience. Not only does it cover some basics in Python, but it also covers some R code and a lot of command line/terminal/bash knowledge, which is really helpful in bioinformatics. Good luck with your adventure in bioinformatics. 
Sounds like you want to make a D2 bot. From some quick searching, there's a lot of material out there (looks like also for 1.14), but not Python. Usually AutoIt, or C or C++ code. Try to get one of the basic 1.14 bots working, see how that works, and then convert or bind to Python? These bits of documentation also look pretty good: http://www.ericcarmichael.com/my-diablo-2-botting-phase.html http://www.blizzhackers.cc/viewtopic.php?t=409747 https://ellysh.gitbooks.io/video-game-bots/content/InGameBots/example.html There's also a python d2 library which you could use as a reference, and maybe adapt a bit for what you want to do: https://code.google.com/archive/p/d2py/source 
A better function would be: def noLettter(string): return string not in ascii_letters That way the output would be True or False rather than True or None. But I didn't know that this subreddit was a place where we did other people's homework. Seriously.
There's the builtin `unittest` module, though you might want to combine it with a test runner like `py.test` or `tox` to get prettier output and some more advanced features.
He did not say anything about false, thats why i made it this way.

Language translation is very difficult. Google and Microsoft have hundreds of PhDs and still don't get terribly good results. So the first step would be to take CS classes on NLP and go from there.

Thanks! I will have a look there :-). I hope it's not all about basics. 
Not sure what celery has to do with the topic. It's a background job manager/runner.
&gt; selectolax I might vote for [lxml](http://lxml.de/) with XPath. Also [phantomjs](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs.git) (javascript) might be good for headless javascript passing. selectolax looks pretty interesting. Is "lxml with css selectors instead of xpath" an accurate description of this? 
&gt; 2: you have you actually use it to retain what you're learning "retain what you're learning" is such a depressing way of looking at the world. I much prefer to think in terms of "truly master / understand"... If you want to just retain some facts you could write some essays and then use anki.... 
`python3 ./name_of_script.py` should work just fine. Did you get any errors when running that?
...yeah that just worked. No idea how, could swear I did exactly that about 30m ago. I mean, obviously I didn't, but... yeah. Anyway. Case closed, all -.-
You can actually make things even easier for yourself: make the first line of your script `#!/usr/bin/env python3`, and then make your script executable with `chmod +x your_script.py` in the terminal. Then you can run your script simply with `./your_script.py`.

Yes. 
unittest is a standard xunit library, which will feel familiar if you know other xunit frameworks. py.test is a much better testing framework for python though, but if you don't know python, it might not work for you.
The first example: Not much. serum will provide you with type inference for tools that support it (without the boilerplate), provide immutability for all injected members. The second example: assuming Database is abstract (which imo it should be) it wouldn't possible to wire up your app like that.
First install debian then type sudo apt install python3
Start with https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python, they have a great python course! With them I manage to learn not only python, but also how to think on solving issues! I would recommend a course like theirs, where you have to code, rather then watching a video course where they don’t explain, but just code.
If you need finer granularity setting (per directory basis or system wide) for Python version, I would recommend [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).
Hi, an author is here. Thanks for your criticism! As I've targeted people from data science, for us python = CPython. But given that this list may be copy-pasted to various places with no relation to DS, I've added a necessary comment about this (so please have a look at the text again). Thanks again. 
&gt; type inference for tools that support it (without the boilerplate) 
I just started using devpi as a caching mirror to try to accomplish the same thing but for offline development. This looks cleaner and more reliable for a production build. Thanks for the tip!
Python or PHP wont make a difference. They're both fast enough for this. You need to look at your database code first.
There are several other projects attempting to recreate this but not in its 2007 - 2008 form.
Hmm, well, its been a month since you said this, happen to be more fluent? I know it doesn't just come like that just curious what you've been up to! :D
Are you using IDLE? The Python shell in IDLE knows nothing about your files. Also, post questions like these in /r/learnpython next time :)
`pytest` is my favorite and comes with many plugins. I also use `tox` to run my test suite against different Python versions.
Yes I'm using IDLE and through the IDLE I press RUN&gt; Python shell and it gives me that "a" is undefined. So what should I do? Thank!
What is your end goal here? Do you want it to act as if you ran the program inside the interactive shell?
I've been using docker more than 2 years... I recently started in Python and I find very useless virtualenv
Well I was thinking of making a list and inserting random number in the list. After I insert number in the list, make the program predict the number that was typed in the most times. 
i’ve gone full docker. yes i mount the source into the machine as a volume. i’m on mac, and it’s a little slow, BUT the piece of mind i get that everything that works on my machine will 100% work on my prod box is priceless. i have a docker-compose.yaml that sets up my entire dev environment (my team is about 12~ devs) we no longer take a day to setup a new dev box. takes about 10 mins. that’s another huge win! another big plus is that since all of our projects are docker-ized when you do `brew update` and then clean your brew you don’t lose your bindings ;). YET. another big win, for dev we keep out dbs inside the docker machine, so different projects don’t remotely interfere (same goes for redis) having this isolation works fantastic for me. wouldn’t go back to virtualenv at all at this point, i want more than python abstraction, i want environment abstraction 😜 
Cheers Bro! The yt channel look pretty good, thanks! 
That sounds cool! My biggest gripe is I don’t like Docker volumes and even in production, I keep my database outside my Docker cluster.
in production, i bake the code into the image, and the db is rds... so it doesn’t matter.
ps. virtualenv just abstracts python, nothing else. that’s not enough these days, you have code that’s very specific to postgres/redis/specific versions of external libs (think ssl)... these are all outside of virtualenv... thus in my view, bad. you won’t have a problem now, specially if the project is still in active dev, but when you put it on hold and you update postgres on your machine, do a brew update that updated more core libs, and wait about a year, you fire your now old project and things start to break... with docker you will NEVER have this issue. word to the wise, do this setup now and don’t cause headaches for your future self later
Doesn't `pip install --download` do exactly this?
Many thanks for these answers, I really appreciate it. I will try to find some project to work on, admittedly I am not sure if there is there is any project for a total beginner like me. Haha.
It might work, but readability is very poor. Break it up into some sensibly named functions and make your variable names more meaningful will help people understand what your are doing.
This sounds like a homework question. Can you show us what you've already tried?
But its compulsory for me to use python language :(
a big web app
Quick and dirty example ;)
Pipenv is vastly superior to setting up an entire shit container for packages.
sure. pipenv &gt; pip, but just use it for the pipfile.lock not for the env part — it’s not needed
sure. pipenv &gt; pip, but just use it for the pipfile.lock not for the env part — it’s not needed
&gt; I found your documentation a bit hard to follow Sorry about that btw :(. this is the first version, I'll try to make the documentation more easy to follow in future versions. Suggestions are very welcome.
Running a virtualenv is superior to spinning up an entire container.
i thought like you. then i tried it (on linux) and i realize how wrong i was. deployments become a breeze, doing blue green becomes a breeze, testing becomes a breeze. i haven’t seen any upside in prod.

Yeah we've been using devpi for a few years now and the only time it went down was when we ran out of disk space due to a bad logging config. Devpi is rock solid
 x.isdigit() 
What do you mean by "binary" exactly? All data on your disk is technically stored in binary. Do you want to save disk space? Make it impossible to read the data?
Take a look at Flask. It's an easy framework for building an HTTP API. Then the clients can use that API.
I'm still amazed, after all these years, pyenv continues to be a relative unknown. Highly recommend, it just works and has a lot of usability flexibility. Also I'd highly recommend the pyenv-virtualenv plugin (https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv) if you're in the good habit of using virtualenvs.
By binary format I mean not CSV to be specifically. The data in the file is huge; so, loading takes some time. I know that binary will load the data faster than CSV because there is no additional parsing ASCII to decimals. Currently, I have found about two formats -- pickle and parquet (not sure if Parquet is binary though; still researching). I am doing this as a learning experience; it doesn't matter whether I something that is super efficient -- anything faster than CSV will work.
Anaconda on Mac should default 'python' to version 3. (At least it did on my last Mac)
If you have many other similar questions, look up Regular Expressions. It'll be way more beneficial to learn about that, since those are used everywhere. 
If you have multiple interpreters you should be using a tool to control your environment properly. I like pyenv for that, because it removes other python commands from your path rather than just overriding them.
Well, I definitely made many efforts to learn it, as I eventually ended up with something like this (which is said to be a common question): https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/python-cookbook/0596001673/ch09s07.html Did you use a guide to learn tkinter? I’ll post whatever you link me to at the top of this thread and call it a day. 
the next generation of pandas will use Arrow. you can use it today as well https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/pandas.html
I made this simple JSON API builder because I had no time to dive in in `graphql` and just wanted a very simple use case. I share it here with the hope of getting some constructive criticism and hopefully some help in expanding it further.
Ok, here is a request that could benefit others. What documentation would you recommend for people to read when tackling threaded tkinter? I will post it to the top of the thread. 
Try to represent the board with a list of lists. i.e: board = [[0 for i in range(10)] for j in range(10)] 
Well, I don't know if is possible to persist a panda dataframe into binary and then load it again, but you could save the csv data with pack, as c structures. If will use less or more space, that's is unclear. 
lol do it ;)
Can do this wheels? 
You need to admit to your employer that you are in completely over your head and they need to hire someone with experience.
I'm new enough that I can't confess I've really looked into this, but have heard of it. Relatively easy to setup from source? Wouldn't mind giving it a try. 
So you saved the file, but did you actually run it? Otherwise the line defining `a` is never executed.
&gt; pyenv Have seen this before, fair few seem to recommend installing it with something called 'Homebrew.' Again, something I've seen. Right now I've just installed Python direct from the site and my environment is just me using Sublime Text locally. It serves me fine, but I can't help but feel that I'd have more control/range with pyenv. Would you recommend Homebrew? 
[removed]
How is this so if you don't mind me asking? I've just started learning R and it seems the biggest time consumer is double checking/looking up syntax.
You could probably build it on some other machine and copy the files into place manually. I've never done it, but in theory it should work. I guess you could try this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33456771/how-to-install-a-python-module-without-root-pip-setuptools-or-easy-install
Good thing you can do pretty much anything with Python at this point.
&gt; #!/usr/bin/env python3 FTR the shebang line also works on Windows thanks to the [Python Launcher for Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher).
I can't speak to R's syntax, maybe it's particularly convoluted, but it usually doesn't take that long to pick up the important points of a language. It's a fairly straightforward thing to make a program do what you want it to. What is harder is writing simple yet expressive code that tells you what it is doing, that is reusable, changeable, and testable. Code that other people could pick up years from now, quickly wrap their heads around, and change to meet their new requirements without fear that they've broken something. I've written lots of code that did what I wanted it to, not realizing the nightmare I was in for should I ever decide to change something.
use parquet, much faster loading
You can use Parquet or the HDF datastore, both are binary
&gt; That's a fancy insult. Sorry, not meant as such. My point was that talking about "random crashes" comes across as a very rookie method of approaching stability. I have no idea about your skill level, but if you've been in the business for 3 years you're not green. You should have more exact definitions for how/why it crashes. Does the interpreter exit without calling shutdown/exception hooks? Does it get forcibly killed by the OS? Does the underlying Tcl interpreter throw an error? Does it leak memory? There are a million ways to describe a crash outside your control without using the word random. :) These open up for investigation and learning, and we can have a meaningful discussion that benefits the community and future developers who feel like you do. &gt; I'm not the guy from the blog. Ah, my bad, I read it too quickly and didn't recognize the snippet from the blog. I still feel it is a bit of a strawman, but if you claim you did it that way, you're a more inventive dev than me because it'd not have passed my mind to do it that way. &gt; The limit wasn't about the queue, it was about the GUI element update rate. If you mean 60 individual operations per second as it seems, that does sound weird but I've never looked at that metric. One thing that I can think of is that you could be triggering too many callouts to the Tcl interpreter, e.g. the latter of these two **very quick** examples. def _update_bulk(ev): max_updates = 10 while max_updates and not self._queue.empty(): elem, op = self._queue.get() elem.configure(**op) max_updates -= 1 root.bind('&lt;&lt;update&gt;&gt;', _update_bulk) # in your app core loop while not self._should_exit: # collect and push tuples of (widget, ops) into a queue root.event_generate('&lt;&lt;update&gt;&gt;', when='tail') Alternative two: def _update(ev): elem, op = self._queue.get() elem.configure(**op) root.bind('&lt;&lt;update&gt;&gt;', _update) #somewhere else, update_queue.put((label_widget, {'text': 'My new text')) root.event_generate('&lt;&lt;update&gt;&gt;', when='tail') Note that this latter example has a much wider loop which might go as far down as the Tcl interpreter. &gt; Tk sucks for people who are't seasoned. I would say it's the other way around, but I can see your point. It is very easy to get started with a simple event-driven GUI where you are purely reacting to user input and use only the provided functionality. As you have noted, you do however need a lot of custom code when you want to do more complex interactions, or more long-running calculations. 
If you're open sourcing, I'd like to take a look!
We use nexus for this and some other artifact repo protocols. Does this do anything above and beyond what we get with nexus?
Ok, I updated the blog post. Thank you :-)
While operating in the realm of all possibilities, you may hold true. I'm assuming that the OP wasn't referring to a single standalone crash on a single device spread over time consistent with freak chance. It's more likely that the OP is referring to patterns of behavior which he was unable to rationalize. The TL comment, however, politely nudged OP by pointing out that the crash is not where the information ends --- but rather should serve as the tool necessary to figure out why the crash is happening in the first place (rather than the mentality of "It crashed, let me google why something crashes without any pertinent context."). Your comment, however, appears to be the mark of an unsocialized developer.
I wrote a Python/PowerShell script to periodically install updates to all the modules I have installed locally. I don't understand why the need for locally hosting these as well. Can someone explain please ?
Uploading to pypi is already really easy, it's just: `python setup.py sdist` `twine upload dist/*` each module needs a setup.py properly configured need .pypirc and to register at pypi.org once
How have I never heard of pipenv? It does look nice. I’ll be trying that out later. Thanks 🙂
I downloaded PyCharm and it's much easier to work with. Thank you for you time! :) 
There are some situations where Internet access isn't aloud or available. 
Too late, I was downvoted already :(
We hope it's a homework question. Otherwise it's an example of internet freelancing at it's finest :-)
&gt; /r/learnpython I did yes, but only after doing exactly what I thought I had done previously. I mean, obviously I didn't, but... I have heard of Anaconda, and another user upstairs pointed me towards it as well. I've also been directed toward pyenv and Homebrew. Do you have anything on those? Sorry to hassle btw, feel free to tell me to bugger off and use /r/learnpython. 
Hi, I created an online, easy to use PY to EXE converter. Link here: http://py2exe.net
lol, my name is “Javier Buzzi” sounds better, makes it more official. also not sure python:1.2.3 comes across as correct, i was trying to get a point across not for someone to use py1.2.3
How is it a pain to create an exe from a py file? Using pyinstaller makes it pretty easy imo 
It's true, and my website actually use PyInstaller to make the convertion. But you want to get past the simple "HelloWorld.py" ? It isn't that obvious. I'm not saying my website is the next Google, I'm just saying that instead of spending 2 hours to learn, use &amp; configure PyInstaller you could just spend 5 minutes on my website, for the exact same result.
This is for people who *don’t* want to update.
Fair enough 
As someone who's spent those 2 hours (maybe more) to learn and use pyinstaller, I think this is excellent. I look forward to testing it soon! 
Thanks!
Umm.. what?
I’m sorry, but this looks very dodgy. How do I know you’re not trojaning every executable you produce? There is also the fact that you are clearly trying to piggyback on the popularity of the original py2exe package, with which you have affiliation (you even admit on using pyinstaller behind the scenes). That is a sleazy trick. Sorry, with all due respect, I cannot recommend this.
Source code? Why are you using the name of an existing package?
Also, get an SSL certificate
I don't see whats wrong with trying to tell others i know a bunch of useful stuff
Ok, I went ahead and split it into train data and test data and the accuracy score went from 85.03% to 77.61%. My code changes with 768 data points: ... X_train = X[0:500, :] X_test = X[500:, :] Y_train = Y[0:500] Y_test = Y[500:] ... model.fit(X_train, Y_train, epochs = 1000, batch_size=10) scores = model.evaluate(X_test, Y_test)
We solve this problem with Docker but this is cool to know. 
I've honestly only just heard of it, but it seems to provide a lot of things that otherwise required single letter flags and a bit of digging around to otherwise know about. It doesn't look vital, but it looks like it makes slightly irritating things slightly easier, which is nice.
it’s not, having a lock it’s pretty cool. frankly something i’ve been waiting for for a while. the extra security does hurt — overhype.. not sure if that’s warranted 
Very impressive. How to steps 2 and 3 differ here: https://www.anpylar.com/#samples It looks like in both you select an element and edit the content
The *Tour of Pyroes* tutorial pieces (named *Part X* rather than *Step X*) follow the bottom-up approach of Google's Angular *Tour of Heroes*, because *AnPyLar* builds on the same ideas, as a proof of concept that all that can be done with *Angular* can be done with *AnPyLar* (i.e.: with Python) The differences are reflected in the documentation - *Part 3*: https://docs.anpylar.com/tutorial/top3/index.html It evolves *Part 2* by breaking the functionality into different components. Up until *2* everything was being done in a single block. Now you have different components that play together, giving different responsibilities to each (one displays the list, the other controls the editing of the names, all under the supervision of a master component which instantiates the other two) - *Part 4*: https://docs.anpylar.com/tutorial/top4/index.html It keeps the multi-component structure of *Part 3*. But instead of using pre-cooked Python objects as source data for the list of *Pyroes*, it uses a *Service Provider* (something that offers a generic interface to fetch the data - fetching from the network is done in *Part 6* which offers a simulated and a real network connection) 
[Muntjac](https://github.com/rwl/muntjac) allowed Python access to a rich set of Javascript widgets that came with [Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/elements) - a framework that allowed Java programmers to develop SPAs entirely in Javascript. Would it be on your roadmap to integrate such a widget set? 
I suggest that you have some sort of icon indicating that the page is loading. For instance, when loading the [Advanced Tourer](https://www.anpylar.com/tutorial/tourer) it takes several seconds and the user is wondering if the server is down or the program is broken. 
Why am I still thinking about this? The most elegant I could come up with (although definitely not "absolutely beginner" anymore) is: from itertools import zip_longest print("Multiple of three", "Multiple of five", sep="\t\t") threes = (i * 3 for i in range(1, 100)) fives = (i * 5 for i in range(1, 20)) for t, f in zip_longest(threes, fives, fillvalue=""): print(t, f, sep="\t\t\t")
Unless I am very wrong the key is in the README in the repository: &gt; you just write server-side Python The server generates the (Javascript) components which are then downloaded to the browser. Although you have Python in both cases, the use case is rather different, because in this case Python runs directly in the browser and there is nothing coming from the server (after the initial download of the Python code) In 2018, imho, it would seem a lot more interesting to have an easy bridge to Bootstrap (for example)
This is already available in the *Playground*, which has been the testbed for such functionality. The Plunker samples will be eventually updated.
The words: &gt; There is no such thing as a random crash. Ever. The intent (It would appear) is to totally invalidate the experience of the other person. Yet, a bad power supply will CONSISTENTLY give random crashes, and those crashes won't necessarily be at a consistent place in the code because they are random, hardware-oriented problems. Thus it's not a "single standalone crash" or spread over "sufficient" (&lt;--Spell check should be your friend!) time consistent with freak chance. And an experienced developer would know that. Your comment, however, appears to be made from ignorance and indicates a lack of useful experience. Keep spreading your ignorance however, some day you might actually be right.
Is parquet basically a unified layer for various data systems?
It's unnecessary.
You can use homebrew to install python. I just prefer the anaconda setup since I have to switch between 2 and 3 often. I’ve also used virtualenv to manage environments (but using the anaconda-installed python). I know very little on the other tools. Anaconda just makes everything easier. Especially since I also often use NumPy and SciPy
Well you have to practice your ability to solve problems. Try some code challenges (there are tons on the intern), or start a pet project, find something you'd like to do and start building just for fun. I always do that, like now I'm building a web scraper to fetch audiobooks from a website &amp; display them in a mobile app. Learning how to program is like learning a new language. If you only know the words and how to use them, it won't be enough. You have to start speaking to really understand how everything works.
[removed]
You definitely have to practice. Most interviews ask you algorithm based questions (some simple, some easy). Here are some resources to help you practice: * [Exercism](http://exercism.io/) * [InterviewCake](https://www.interviewcake.com/) * [Cracking The Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/) Good luck!
logic really is not something to be taught, but something to be learned. i have similar problems, and when i asked a friend of mine who is a few years my senior in python, he told me this. "start making video games. cheezy 2d rpgs and side scrollers. make a D&amp;D character generation program. make games. they are all about logic!, think about it. when you play an RPG, you keep health, mana, movement, armor, strength, dodge, accuracy, maps, puzzles, and all of it man... games. thats how you make logic. "
Yea maybe your right
Sure start a pet project, but then comes to another decision to make...should I use functional programming or object oriented programming style?
With an internal git server pip install git+http://gitlab.example.org is just as easy to use and doesn't require going to IT for 'another' server.
so, i started doing the tutorials here. programarcadegames.com. and he was right. theres tons of logic man. heres another little tip that helped me alot. find your end goal. work backwards, and make an outline. so im making an RPG right now, what do i need? well i need a way to know when combat starts, well, how about a step counter? how would i do that? ok, now that ive found one way to do it, how else could i do it? ill share a couple snippets of how i got past this particular problem. current_step = 0 step_counter = random.randint(1, 121) for current_step in step_counter: if camera_move &gt;= 0: current_step +=1 if current_step &gt;= step_counter: battle_start = True the problem i had with this one, was i was not comfortable with the step counter being reliant on the camera, it could cause bugs later in the game if the camera needs to move but a battle is not the outcome i want. so i came up with this one instead step = false step_counter = 10 + random.randint(1,101) for steps in step_counter: if step is True: step_counter -= 1 if step_counter &lt;= 3: battle = 0 
You may be interested in [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5lWfHEeibs). It's from a Ruby conference, but should be general enough, other than specific tool recommendations, for Python or whatever other language. The summary is that interview coding and real job coding are mostly different skills, and it gives some examples of how to get better at the interview side, along with a list of skills/topics to practice. The speaker did mention Exercism as well, which would probably help with the logic (though I haven't tried it myself).
Very cool. I think I will be able to use this. Thank you!
Great!
Open.kattis.com Fun programming website with a tonnnn of problems and automated judging. Love to practice problem solving and logic here🙂
This is really cool, but in on Android Chrome, I'm having trouble seeing the actual image from the numbers.
This is a big problem I myself face even now. I now go with the philosophy of "Use familiar technologies unless one of the purposes of the project is to learn a new technology."
Misleading a little though because we don't walk around with a square around our face lol.
Do you know how to compose separate pieces of code (put them together)? Start with this: do you know how to test for a condition, and run something only if it is true? if i % 2 == 0: print("i is an even number") Do you know how to append an item to a list? mylist = [] mylist.append(17) Now put them together! if i % 2 == 0: mylist.append(17) Wait, you probably don't want to add 17 every single time... then change it to whatever it is that you do want to add: if i % 2 == 0: mylist.append(i) And now you are programming. 
You could use OpenCV to check the values of the pixels on the face Dlib detects. Then if they are above a certain threshold save an image.
I find myself to really struggle with only functionnal programming. Since I learned OOP, I write all of my code as object-oriented as possible. But really, my rule of thumb is, if a function needs more than 3 arguments, it's probably better if it's in a class, with thos arguments as attributes, same if you need global variables, that's probably better to refactor into an object. For small-scale stuff, functionnal programming works well enough, for anything bigger, like GUIs, django/flask stuff, big data... OOP is the way.
You just need to practice. A good place to start is to look at other people's code, and learn from the structure, then try that in your own projects. Write code the way you used to, and then go back, and try to improve its speed/memory usage by cutting down on loops/using the appropriate data structures. Learn another language. C forces you to optimize a lot more, and you learn more about the logic of programming. do a lot of debugging. Bugs usually come from unlogical programming, so hunting them teaches you how to do things properly. Try and respect the PEP8, the guidelines in there are very useful in writing better code (well most of them anyways, I prefer tabs over spaces). Learn more about the language (classmethods, list comprehensions, built-in functions, magic methods, properties, decorators) and try to refactor some of your existing code using that, see what works better for each specific case, and then generalize.
Sounds like you could benefit from going back to basics and refreshing your knowledge of data structures and algorithms. A lot of interview questions are based on these concepts and if you've spent the last few years doing sys admin-type stuff you won't have had a chance to practice them. This link that's in the sidebar is a good, Python-specific starting point: [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html) There is a book version of this text as well that you can buy on Amazon, among other places, if you prefer a physical format.
That's a way to internally host a pip package, but what about the recursive dependencies of that package?
no - apache arrow is a new intermediate, columnar data format. http://wesmckinney.com/blog/apache-arrow-pandas-internals/
Setting up my environment variable with windows 8.1 and I honestly think that I could learn much faster if I use Ubuntu 14.04 Did try to have some example, few success to many failure but I will decide that this is my stepping stone.
Why were you learning to code in the first place? If it was purely for fun, and it's no longer fun then you can just stop, right? If, instead, you're hoping to use your skills in the real world, what would that look like? Do you want to make we applications? Games? Chat bots? Do you just want to automate the reports that you have to write every month for your boss? I've been coding professionally for 16 years, and I've always find it impossible to code without some clear idea of what I'm trying to achieve. For me, work is play, but I can't just play around without direction. Maybe you could get involved in some open source projects? 
Might be. Can you fix it? I mean, do you have the necessary permissions to fix it? I think that would help some people who just want to try the code and don't know so much yet about Python. 
Ah, I just switched so didn't know that. That's quite the hassle indeed.
well, since i was a kid i wrote pen an paper games and tabletop systems. notebooks after notebook of not quite dnd style games. python was my way to make games into video games or text games. but i also have dreams of achieving a career in the field. ive done computers my whole life. just about everything shy of writing the software myself. malware removal, imaging, hardware compatibility and updating/upgrading, setting up networks, software installations, windows/dos and linux CLI, od emulation (virtualbox, vmware etc.) you name it, ive probably been there. i dont really have an end goal for python beyond, get good enough to feel i can actually do something, make games for ym kids and myself, maybe get a job writing software for web design or maybe a doing /dev on opensource programs. making desktop app clones, libre office style, or Ltris instead of tetris. i mean i dont have too much foresight, but honestly, jsut be productive in some way, and find a way to support my family while doing what i enjoy. of course i code for fun, but the feeling is weird. like i want this but getting it is like walking through cheese graters. swimming in mud while dreaming of a crystal lake. 
I know the feeling you describe. It's akin to writer's block. Simultaneously you want to make something but can't manage to start anything. It sounds like you need to get out of your comfort zone if you want to progress. My advice: learn some Selenium; practice automating Reddit or Google; think about how you would test them, and then start applying for QA/software engineer in test roles. It's hard to find good quality test engineers so it's an easier way to find a job without experience. Once you're there you can try to get more involved with production code. Consider learning Ansible, too. That might help you score a low-level job in operations which, again, is a market where everyone is buying and nobody is selling. 
This is how you learn. Have a goal, work towards it with what you know, observe and evaluate how your solution worked or got stuck. Do it better next time. 
Build stuff instead of reading about it. Make a game. Doesn't even have to be original or commercial, just get it to work and improve it. make Flappy Bird with enemies. Or a scrolling shooter. Or a little time management game (cooking! bars!). Exercise your logic muscles.
Can you try clicking on the gist link and check if it shows up correctly. What about the image of this tweet: https://twitter.com/jakevdp/status/955096368481058817 I'll try some alternate formatting depending on how it looks.
It is not
But nobody integrated before 
It's all in the eye of the beholder, I'm pretty sure if you squint hard enough the the transition from one to the other is very blurry. Many "traditionally" OOP languages have finally adopted a lot of stuff from the traditionally academic functional programming languages. So now you can still encapsulate your state in objects, but use FP paradigms for all your computations/transformations. I think this is a win.

/r/learnpython ? also smells a bit like homework
Look at the [source](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.6/Lib/collections/__init__.py) and how **Counter.most_common** was implemented ... it's so trivial to do least_common in honestly not sure why it's not already part of the interface.

Thanks a lot , i will try again 
Like many have said, logic is something you learn over time. For me, when thinking about how to create new program i like to jot down what each function would do, what it would expect and what it would output and what problems might occur at particular stages etc. Also maybe try Sudoku.
What is the difference between the dpendency graph your framework calculates and the MRO? Have you seen Raymond Hettingers talk from PyCon 2015? It makes it pretty clear that super() and a basic understanding of how the linearization of the ancestry of a class is more than enough. Unless of course you have a typo in your subject, and meant Python 2. 
Which trading site do you recommend then? I haven't heard of GDAX ever being hacked ...
&gt;&gt; There's never a good reason to do from some_module import * &gt; It has its uses. Do you also `using namespace std` in C++? 
Yes
No. I also wouldn't use from module import * in client code. See https://youtu.be/0oTh1CXRaQ0?t=26m39s
The author of web2py has admitted that the web has changed from the client-server response cycle that web2py was developed for. I really dont see anything surpassing AnPyLar in responsive web apps for Python. I wonder if he would join forces with you. similarly, Nagare was a brilliant pure python end-to-end framework but admittedly was best for the non-SPA web space, even though it did have some small javascript hooks. They were excited by Muntjac. I wonder if they would be excited by this. I wonder why I'm the only person posting in this thread :) This is a great new product for Python... In my perspective, I would still using something like web2py or Flask to generate a REST Api, because AnPyLar would then consume those REST services for my database processing. **FINALLY**: have you considered naming this AngularPy? It might show up in more search results and attract people away from AngularJS.. And of course, I'm sure you will submitting something to ToDoMVC at some point. 
Did you get it? Asking for ... myself :p
very detailed and high-quality, thanks for this
Yep works fine on mobile here too.
import random print('=======================') print(' GUESS THAT NUMBER') print('=======================') print() player = input("What is your name: ") the_number = random.randint(0, 100) guess_input = -1 while guess_input != the_number: guess_input = int(input('Guess a number between 0 and 100: ')) # count_list = [] # count = count_list.append(guess_input) # tries = len(count) if guess_input &lt; the_number: print("Too low") elif guess_input &gt; the_number: print("Too high") else: print("\nYou win!!") print("\nWell done {}".format(player)) # print(tries)
finally, I was waiting for something like this for python :)
Since you didn't ask a question I'm going to assume you're wondering why it doesn't work when you uncomment those three lines (as they are all incorrect). So as not to give you the answer I will explain what to do and why: Move the list declaration out of the loop, you're resetting it to empty over and over. Add a second condition checking the number of tries to the loop declaration, use the `and` keyword. You don't need to assign the append statement to a value, the append value function has no output.
Is the humblebundle spam a common occurrence? 
Thanks for the advice. Just curious, how is writing to csv first faster? I am guessing reading the csv into a dataframe then uploading to sql is not any faster than reading sql into a dataframe to upload? Is there an actual "upload csv" command/process?
It already exists. It's called attrs.
The existence of `Nagare` was known. Just like with the other projects `AnPyLar` is an attempt to depart from the previous schemes and do everything on the client. `AngularJS` and `Angular` are names which belong to *Google* (unclear if they are trademarks) Calling it `AngularPy` would clearly enter into a territory where a "Cease and Desist" letter could be possible (I doubt it would happen, but there would for sure be grounds for it). That's why the name was based on `Angular`, making sure it was different enough and having `Py` somewhere. &gt; I wonder why I'm the only person posting in this thread :) This is a great new product for Python... Probably people, in general, don't have that much interest in such a thing as `AnPyLar`
Let's say Amazon begins to charge 5x more for their service or deprecates part of API that was crucial for your business logic. What's your plan on mitigating those risks and does your business acknowledge them? 
What do you use inside the serverless function? And what do you use to deploy? You know you can deploy Flash (or even Django) using one of various frameworks? That is very convenient since you can use existing tools and addons you have build/gathered over time. Like we got a bunch of Django projects because we have a pile of code and experience with it. One is actually a hybrid with some part of it running serverless and some on EC2 instances. Also there is nothing really Python specific about serverless frameworks. It is just another way to deploy the same kind of code really. And serverless is very new, companies are slow to change if at all. See /r/webdev, /r/serverless, /r/aws etc
If they charge 5x more, we'll still save money compared to running all of it on a dedicated instance somewhere. But I see what you mean. If the cost of actually running it serverless would surpass what the actualy hardware costs, we could move everything over to physical machines within 4-12 hours, without any data-loss. The send out the new endpoints to partners and make them switch. (Luckily I work in a business where none of the endpoints are public, so I can literally hit up every CTO of our partners to make this a priority.) In regards to deprecation, I do not know how they could do that, since the logic of the API is written by us. Unless they decide to retire the api gateway altogether, we would not run into issues. And even if they did, we would be back up and running within a business day.
Inside the function it's mostly python with some additional libraries, nothing big like flask and django as that gets handled by their respective services after the api/lambdas. We played a bit with deploying flask inside a serverless function, but the runtime and memory cost was too high for it to make sense, so we basically replaced flask with the api gateway and django with csv based s3 buckets that serve dynamo/redshift/mysql. To deploy we use chalice, which is an aws tool that allows you to deploy lambdas and api gateway endpoints in one go with very little code and has built in versioning. We also have some hybrids that still use our "potato" ec2 instances as we call them (micros) to do some light calculation work with the received data. Mainly because that part of the logic has not been moved to cronbased alarms yet and because the servers literally cost 5 bucks a month... Yes I know serverless is not python specific, but I feel that especially for the usecases that are discussed here, python + serverless is just as good an approach as the flask/django solutions that people offer.
Do you have any idea how?
yup. https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/duplicates/7qdd72/humble_book_bundle_python_by_packt_ends_in_1_day/
Sure, Python has libraries to access the GPU, just like most languages and runtimes that can wrap low level bindings. But where would this Python code run? On the client or as part of the database? What does it do to "improve SQL queries using the GPU"? What does that mean? I think something specific was lost in what the engineer said, or it was just a general statement. 
I just had that same problem! I had my % path set up to a different, older python folder, so pip was putting everything in the wrong place. In PyCharm, try settings &gt; project interpreter. See if there are two different environments set up. Good luck! 
Oops I'm sorry the code should not have turned out that way, I just copied and pasted it.

Come to tex.stackexchange.com we are a friendly bunch
The tasks involve crypto stuff which is not something that the majority of programmers do. The description should mention that.
Why? Are you trying to do something that's not covered by the bot API? If so, what?
They all ready exist, there is also [python-autoclass](https://smarie.github.io/python-autoclass/).
Whatever you do please look up how to write Python for loops. Very strong hint you **DON'T** need `range`.
Fyi it's still not formatted. Using Chrome on OSX.
Weird. 
Are you sure that the performance bottleneck does not come from: - Unoptimized SQL query ? - Your database schema being not suitable for what you are doing ? - No existing indexes on relevant fields ? - Not the good database config tuning ? 
Why? What's your end goal here?
I want to run an algorithm which detects if a number is a float or not.
 5 % 5 == 0 5 % 2 == 0 The above basically checks if the second number goes into the first number evenly. If it does then the division results in a whole number, if not then it would be a fraction/decimal. The first one returns true. the second one returns false. I'm in the same boat as K900_ though. Without knowing what your trying to do its kind of hard to give you good advice.
Look guys, I just want to check if 5 / 2 is float 5 / 5 is float But python always returns float even if it's `5/5` which is `1`
I want `5 / 5` to return `1` Not `1.0`
 def divide(x, y): return x//y if (x//y)*y==x else x/y
Thank you very much!!!
Hi, Sure i'm getting the hang of it. If you have something shoot it my way. If someone else does it better and faster then that's just another opportunity to learn. I've done mostly stuff like moving data between apis and using os and stuff to do crawling automations.
If you are interested in making a GUI python application, I really recommend checking out [cefpython](https://github.com/cztomczak/cefpython).
Thanks for the reply. I would say that I'm 98% sure. Just giving you some context, we have a tax calculation software, so we pretty much need to make sums and work with views using many tables and as much most of the time we have the results in an acceptable time, some of our users insert 5 million rows/day in some tables, and for these ones which have a huge amount of data, we would like to, at least try, to solve this problem with GPU parallelism, instead of beef up their hardware in general.
A bot can't see conversations in my channel. I want to record my channel and relay it to my other channel 
What is the function you are running? You are assuming this function has time complexity of O(n). For example, if your function is O(n log n), the larger dataset would take about 10 minutes to process given these numbers.
A bot can join channels on it's own?
Make your bot an administrator. That will make it able to see all messages.
A bot can't join channels by itself, but it can be added to one and made administrator. It'll then be able to see all messages in that channel. 
Have you tried [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/)?

CPython preallocates all the numbers in `range(-5, 257)`.
I thought I saw that values near 1000 are also preallocated?
Thanks. This was helpful for my current project.
You can test for yourself: &gt;&gt;&gt; for n in range(900, 1100): ... if n is int(str(n)): ... print(n) ... &gt;&gt;&gt; `n is int(str(n))` is a way to test if `n` is preallocated. There are no results in `range(900, 1100)`.
The problem isnt you need to understand tkinter, the problem is you _dont_ understand threading and are trying to force a gui toolkit to follow your incorrect understanding of threading. Directly doing threading is a very low level way of tackling parallel programming, and is very very hard to get right (i.e. you need to build a complete model of your synchronisation model and prove it is correct)
That why i thought about adding user
I know you’re right, but I’ve written various threads that handle IO without an issue. But, normally I am in control of the main thread too. I found a book by Mark Lutz that seems to be the end all, be all solution (even though it’s dated). 
Data structures seldom make sense in a language like python. You can create something like a linked list in pure python, but its going to perform poorly and you won't actually learn all that much because the GC is going to track your references. Most of the stuff you need to learn with in a datastructures is more low level, and you really should use a language closer to the machine, like C or C++. In those languages you will actually have to code correctly and think about the invariants of the structure, otherwise you will potentially leak memory, or try to access something after it has been freed, etc...
 &gt;&gt;&gt; a = 256 &gt;&gt;&gt; b = 256 &gt;&gt;&gt; c = 257 &gt;&gt;&gt; d = 257 &gt;&gt;&gt; id(a) == id(b) True &gt;&gt;&gt; id(c) == id(d) False &gt;&gt;&gt; e = -5 &gt;&gt;&gt; f = -5 &gt;&gt;&gt; g = -6 &gt;&gt;&gt; h = -6 &gt;&gt;&gt; id(e) == id(f) True &gt;&gt;&gt; id(g) == id(h) False `a` and `b`, and `e` and `f` are the same object, because they are predefined. The other integer objects are created on the go and thus have different `id()`'s. 
I recently learned and used appJar.. This module is based on tkinter and super easy to use. 
Sure, but instead of testing the equality of the ids with `id(a) == id(b)`, it's more direct to do identity comparison with `a is b`. And instead of having to create `a` and `b` separately you can synthesise `a` from `b` using `b = int(str(a))` (or `b = a + 1 - 1`, or any of a number of different methods). And you can test a whole lot of numbers at once by using a loop.
Oh, I forgot you can compare objects directly. And you're right, you could synthesize `b` like that, but I just wanted to show the boundaries of the predefined integers, and this was less typing \^\^
so, would things like web scapers such as scrapy/beautiful soup or an os program that runs ping tests via CLI fall into the web automation category? 
or if i where to say make a program that scraped the webpage and compiled a json or xml of the info? 
Just a heads up for someone considering this, looks like cef can only package to Windows. Looks cool though.
Where did you see that? Should be able to distribute to Windows, Mac, and Linux.
Yes, but it achieves the same goal, right? That is, to zip a module and make it pip installable. so you can `pip install my_module` Since I do development between 2 Desktop OS's and my laptop, it's worth these extra steps. Or if you don't want to deal with uploading to pypi and setting that up, you could just `pip install git+https://github.com/github_user/repo_name`
Well in this case, it seems out of my skills. Just to know, what is your DBMS ? PostgreSQL ? I may be wrong but, with the amount of data you are dealing with, I don't think running SQL queries using on the GPU will help you a lot in the long run. I seems to me to be more about architectural design, but I could not help you on the matter. :/
Is there another way to package it aside from [pyinstaller](https://github.com/cztomczak/cefpython/blob/master/examples/pyinstaller/README-pyinstaller.md)? That site says: &gt;Only Windows platform is currently supported. I could be misunderstanding though, maybe it's only referring to that example.

How does CEF compare to Electron? Is it any lighter?
Sorry to necromancy an old thread, but is there a good source for python documentation for those kind of weird random functions that you may need? One that comes to mind is Tuples (no relation to the data type), as in `Tuples[{0,1},3]` yields: 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 ... and other functions. I was looking for that one in particular a while ago, and I ended up defining my own function that wrote numbers in binary and then zeroed out the leading digits to the desired length and grabbed the digits. 'Stupid way to do it but it works' seems to be my MO ever since trying to make the switch; I'd rather a place where I can search for nifty mathematica functions that do what I know...
Why do you even have a loop? Your code does nothing. So first point is I can't help you without a real problem. The second obvious issue is you shouldn't be doing a for loop on a large number of points with pandas. You need to vectorize your code. Only call the function once and get rid of the for loop. Third point is we need to see the internal function in order to help you with anything.
Hmm that is a fair point. My understanding is that the developer behind cefpython is primarily a Windows guy so he simply doesn't spend a lot of time on unix issues. [This thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/cefpython/ZCQWjutERHc/a0Jldfc1AAAJ) claims that there is a workaround for OSX but I am not sure about linux.
also, https://data.world/
You can coax the Spotify API to dump lots of data about it's songs. There are enough features built in to get a classifier trained
My process is the same as your except for: &gt; I looked into pbr and there is also versioneer. Inside my `__init__.py` file in my root directory, I have: isi_exe = False if is_exe: # pyInstaller from mycode.version import __version__, __releaseDate__ else: import subprocess def get_git_revision_short_hash(): try: #ghash = subprocess.check_output(['git', 'rev-parse', '--short', 'HEAD']) # independent of location as long as there is a git folder # what about if you use setup_user.py install? # what about if you don't have git? # can raise a subprocess.CalledProcessError, which means the return code != 0 ghash = subprocess.check_output(['git', 'describe', '--always'], cwd=os.path.dirname(__file__)) ghash = ghash.decode('utf-8').rstrip() except: # git isn't installed ghash = 'no.checksum.error' return 'dev.%s' % ghash revision = get_git_revision_short_hash() __version__ = '1.1.0+%s' % revision __releaseDate__ = '2017/5/xx' __releaseDate2__ = 'MAY xx, 2017' I just update that stuff for release and delete the git block. It takes me a minute and as you can see, I don't release very frequently. The gui, which uses pyInstaller automatically makes a `version.py` file, but everyone else just imports from the init file.
Thanks.
Initially, Electron used CEF but now it wraps chromium directly. CEF is a little "heavier" but more abstracted from the chromium internals. Also pretty nice because there are a number of projects that wrap the "backend" in different environments. Python is probably the most popular one but there is a Java (java-cef) project as well. Electron is pretty cool but I have never been a fan of server-side JS.
Do you mind dumping your changelog script? I don't do that :)
Very interesting stuff, thanks! I discovered the lda library recently and was thinking of applying it to great works of literature in a way related to how the Markov chain is applied to them in one of the assignments at your link.
And [confirm in source](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/4830f581af57dd305c02c1fd72299ecb5b090eca/Objects/longobject.c#L18-L23).
I recommend Qt
There are a few other special numbers that are preallocated.
Got it, I was just calling it out in case someone was looking to build a cross platform product. The first thing I thought when I saw HTML5 and Chromium was that this is Electron for Python, but it doesn't look like that's quite the case.
To some degree it is. You wont get as much control over the chromium internals as you do with Electron, but you can still emulate a client-server web application pretty easily.
Who in South Jersey is hiring python developers? Im from right outside AC, wondering whats out there.
Nice dude, I just started myself, cool to see how quick your progression was.
Just worked on this the other day. For Python 3, I found that PyInstaller worked but you have to compile on different machines for different functionality (compile on Windows x64 for Windows x64 machines, etc.). 
This was posted here less than a week ago. https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/7qwuwy/free_python_book/?st=jcqzmtnz&amp;sh=9cd17fc9
Thank you, I have edited the post with complete code now. I presumed it to be redundant, my mistake. Now I can see the performance problem lies with the for loop on large dataframe. Can you please elaborate the point to vectorize my code? My thought here was to read all the string rows in the column and clean them off punctuation and special characters and parse it back to same row position. Guess I shouldn't do that. My goal is to have a place where I have all the strings stored after cleaning. Thought storing back the cleaned strings back to the same row positions, overwriting was a good idea.
I read the intro paragraphs and scanned down the page...and still have no idea what this thing is. 
Think of it like Electron but replace Node.js with Python. You can write your UI with the typical client-side web stack (HTML, CSS, and JS) and then use Python for your application logic. However instead of using XmlHttpRequests, you can do direct method calls from Python to your client-side JS and vice versa. 
...why on earth would I want to add 3 more languages to an already complicated task?
Hi, pyglet contributor here. You can certainly use pyglet to make this style of graphics. You'll want to use the pyglet.graphics module. http://pyglet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/programming_guide/graphics.html Definitely read the parts about "Batches" and "Groups". I would suggest creating a few template classes for things such as squares, circles, etc. to help create the scenes. Let me know if you need some pointers. 
You see that post stickied at the top of the sub? 
Only use Tkinter if you have a death wish. Not good for anything complex. Grid layout is a mess.
In my experience once you get the environment stuff set up on Windows it's pretty usable. That said, Linux makes it pretty easy pretty much right out of the gate.
A few reasons come to mind. First, UI packages for Python aren’t that great and require a lot of extra work on behalf of the developer. Since the internet exploded, there is a lot of great stuff (UI styling, components, MVC frameworks) that you can get for free. Second, writing your UI with a web stack makes it easier to port your application to the web should that ever interest you. 
 Thanks!
It is referring only to that example. CEF can be packaged without problems on all platforms.
Just updated the pyinstaller example you're feferring to: &gt; Although this pyinstaller example supports only packaging on Windows, CEF can be packaged on all platforms without problems, but this specific packaging example just wasn't tested on other platforms. Pull requests are welcome.
really! and am least bother about u... but still somebody reading my blog.
Wait...are you using a dictionary or are you using pandas/numpy? Your code is still super abstract and doesn't run. It's not a real problem. What you're trying to do and what data do you have? How did you get that data and what is really you're ultimate goal of massaging x into y? &gt; y goal is to have a place where I have all the strings stored after cleaning. Which strings? `testing_`? Why do you need a lambda and a regex to sort a string?
I'm uploading the screenshots. screenshot 1: https://ibb.co/juitZG screenshot 2(after the code snippet): https://ibb.co/gnzBMw I'm not sorting. I want to have the pandas dataframe column 'comments', to have no punctuations and special characters. The initial data has lots of punctuations, special characters (screenshot1). So I tried to clean them and put back the cleaned string back in the same row/ index position of the comments (screenshot 2). These data are from Kaggle competition toxic comments classification. I wanted to go ahead and attempt word to vector conversion later, hence needed a clean set of strings (comments column, screenshot1) with no punctuation to attempt logistic regression. So basically I need to take out all the data in the comments column and strip out punctuations and have them saved in a list or in another pandas column to do words to vector conversion.

Shouldn't the output column be excluded from the input data, or does Keras automatically handle that?

Homebrew is pretty good a far as a package manager goes. The only gripe I have for it is that it installs everything from the tarball explicitly, meaning there really is no security there. However most of the packages are linked directly to their GitHub, so as long as you read through source you're in good shape. Brew does a great job of allowing you to set up a dotfile repo so you can deploy your environment programmatically, which is a huge plus.
interesting, this is like a github for data?
Nice, when I was little I had a theory that the 8th song on a album is usually pretty good. Maybe time to put that to a test.

Nice thank you :)
you should cross post into /r/learnpython and /r/learnprogramming. start out with a number guessing game, get comfortable with inputs, for loops, while loops, and elif ladders. for the number guessing game, you should be able to choose how many rounds you want to play, the min and/or max number range to guess between, and keep score of right and wrong guessing. you don't need a function but if you can figure out how to turn it into a function, you should. the next project to get on would eb a rock paper scissors game. same thing, using loops and functions, keeping score of wins losses and ties, and for both of these projects do your best to keep it DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) one other good beginner project is to make a choose your own adventure story, you can do this is three major ways. one way is to make an elif ladder using while loops to segment your story. the next way is to use dictionaries to make rooms, the third way is to make each story segment its own function and call each other based on input, the last way is to do it in .txt files, and use file handling and delimiters to call story sections. if you feel these are not challenging enough, then you might be ready to expand your knowledge beyond basics. you could start with django or flask to get into web design, or pygame/tkinter/pyQT/panda3D for desktop apps and cross platform games. if you really want to make a work portfolio look nice, i would recommend some advice that i myself got earlier today, get into selenium and ansible. web automation is always hiring, also look into PHP its similar enough to python to make an easy transition, while having a different purpose it will help you expand your web design and server management skills. having HTML and CSS is also a pretty addition to a python portfolio. learning things like matplotlib would help you get into data sciences and database entry internships. and really the best ive gotten in advice so far is to make RPG games. there are tons of logic in them. its a great way to build skills and problem solve, its also a lot of info to debug which helps improve your ability to seek and fix logical errors. i wish you the best, and i only have one question for you... what is the average airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow? 
also, do not let recursion scare you. its simply making a function call it self under certain circumstances. def recursiveness() words = " these words repeat" print("words") recusiveness() recursiveness() example of a recursive function*
Your answer gave rise to another question in me, and that is that, in that case, are there any interpretive languages which do any kind of static memory allocation? Also, if dynamic allocation allows for reduced memory usage, then why languages such as Java and C don't use it for primitive data types?
Try PyInstaller with the --onefile option. It will generate a single .exe that contains all the necessary libraries.
lol this is funny timing :)
Sure, but that's less immediately useful, whereas if you say: "I taught myself programming, and then I learned how to use Selenium, and how to do TDD with purest" those are immediately applicable skills. Those are things that people will pay you money to do while you continue to learn other stuff.
so ive been reading up a bit on selenium, and i think im far enough to be able to start with it, but im not finding hardly anything for selenium tutorials and im not quite sure how to get started or what kinds of prerequisite python code i might need, (BTW ive never done web scraping, and i should probably learn hat first, but, i see your point, and now im interested in this. )
nevermind. im dumb. i just found a nice bundle of youtube start guides for it... i should have looked ahrder before asking. i kept finding java stuff for it, but i finally broke into some python guides. 
What?
I think I've tried pyinstaller and Py2app I'll have to look up the other one. Thank you. 
I am sorry if my question doesn't make sense, but I am depressed and frustrated. Since two days, I am trying to run Python from Git Bash but failing. What happens is that Python shell opens easily if I first open Anaconda Prompt and type 'python', and I can start programming. But if I first, open Git Bash(as told in an online course) and type python and other commands to make it work, nothing happens. And then if I open Anaconda Prompt after all this, it says that this app can't work in your PC, and access is denied comes written on the prompt.
Download the python embeddable zip file. Unpack it. Edit the *._pth file to import site (you have to uncomment 1 line). Download and run get-pip with the local python. Install your deps with the recently downloaded pip. Run you script. Plus: you can pack all the py files to a PyZipfile and you can compile an exe that uses the python3.dll and runs your script directly (no further need of the python.exe)
I made a Brainfuck interpreter and translator to C. Here's the [link] (https://github.com/Sayan98/bfutil)
Is this Python's version of Electron.js?
It's a Cygwin shell set up with git, because git doesn't work on Windows. Not a Windows user myself, just explored it a bit at my old work.
And then you learn about Qt versions and being a bitch to distribute and compile and then you learn about it's dumb licensing and then you learn about python packages always having issues and then you finally move away to something less stressful. All of that aside I really enjoyed pyside with qt designer few years ago, but recently I tried to pick it up again and got quickly turned away.
One of my favorite things about python is you can do almost anything with it! I am writing my own mobile app which will be cross platform using kivy for my front end and Django for backend. The best way to learn is to build something. 
Git bash is a nice and pain-free way to install Cygwin on Windows. And having a bash-like environment certainly helps when you get into python. But it is not at all necessary. In fact, starting the python interactive interpreter from the git bash is for some reason extremely slow on my windows machine, but I don't know if that's just a config blunder on my side. I don't know how you want to interact with python, so I can't really tell you the best first step. If you just want to play with the interactive interpreter, just start it from your start menu. If you want to run scripts, you can associate *.py files with Python to make it start those files. If you need to start them from a terminal environment (e.g. you want to pass parameters), git bash should work. So should Anaconda Prompt (which is basically just another bash replacement as far as I can see).
For ease of management use RabbitMQ.
Didn't know this one, I'll take a look Thanks a lot!
&gt; Can someone give a tldr? 
It doesn't really matter much in this simple case but it is a bit wasteful to concatenate lists just for iteration if you can `itertools.chain(pumps, valves)`. 
place it into a function and if an error is raised by the interpreter, have it restart the function. 
That is repetition, not recursion. Recursion reduces to a base case. Your example doesn't reduce or have a base case.
You can take a look at "windows linux subsystem", it is super great compared to Cygwin. It is just a normal Ubuntu bash shell inside windows.
Tools -&gt; Create Command-line Launcher will make a /usr/local/bin/pycharm

Who's 'we'? 
You could have your config file be a Python module that you import. Or just use ConfigParser or [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml#toml).
Finally a good guide on tkinter
A config class that has methods or @property's, some defaults and a method to load data from some file. ConfigParser is built in, if you use pypi maybe TOML or YAML. If you really have a ton of tweakable values you might even use something spreadsheet-like (CSV/TSV?) or make it webscale and load from Google Sheets :)
I've done basically what you describe using tkinter and pyinstaller to automate simple installs that take a few parameters etc. No issues for me. I originally tried cx_freeze and had tons of trouble with missing libraries after the exe build.
Thanks, I think my biggest hurdle getting going is setting up the overall framework for my project and not being familiar with Python. I know I want a main window with a simple UI, and it will have buttons that create independent graphics windows and position them. Then each graphics window will have a number of difference scenes and a clickable 6 button menu to swap between the scenes. The main window also needs to be able to configure keybinds for each of the buttons on each graphics window independently. I get all that figured out and setup then I can start fooling with the actual content. I have yet to find a way for a background program to capture joystick activity in python. That is something that will be required for my project to work. 
Do you have much experience with web development?
Not really.
There could be a bit of a learning curve there then. If your application is large, you generally want your UI to almost be independent from your core application. What I mean is that you want the UI to be as stateless as possible so that it can render properly based solely on some state passed from the core of the application. A lot of modern JS MVC frameworks are really good at this (React, Angular, etc). On the other hand, if your application is small (e.g. one screen with some user inputs), you can probably get away with just driving your UI interactions from Python directly which would behave similarly to other Python UI frameworks. You can use OOP principles for both cases but I would recommend a more FP approach when dealing with JS. 
Something like this? https://github.com/Tinche/aiofiles RSS feeds are just XML files.
Code. Not codes.
The selenium library would be good for this. 
/r/learnpython 
As far as I know current RSS (I think v2) is based around polling for changes and with the general current implementation there’s really nothing you can do to make something reactive to those. One option would be to abstract away the polling nature and set up a centralized source for the rss check that can then push updates.
Try looking into `pubsubhubbub` (now WebSub)
[removed]
&gt; Both approaches probably leave me with a dictionary, which would make my code not look quite as clean as if I didn’t separate them out (ie params[‘threshold_something’] vs threshold_somwthing). If this is a major issue for you then you could write your config in a standard format like YAML or JSON, and then wherever this is loaded convert it into a nicer format for working with. A straightforward way to do this would be with `SimpleNamespace`, e.g.: ``` import types config = SimpleNamespace(**config_dict) ``` Then you can just refer to things like `config.some_value` throughout your program. Wherever you're doing this conversion would also be a convenient place to handle things like validation that certain values which must always be set in the config are set, or that any defaults for unset values are automatically set in `config` if needed. 
Yep. I wish this post was on the splash screen of Qt Designer to serve as a warning or something...
Not just asyncio.
Spoiler: it takes three clicks to reach the content, and it turns out it's just another udemy class.
I use a settings.py or a .env file depending on the project. Just import the setting or environ.get() the setting you need
Kivy is not easier. Packaging is nightmare across Python.
What is 'buy it for life' about it?
The host of Talk Python to Me and Python Bytes commented about GUI building a few days ago. Here is his [tweet.] (https://twitter.com/mkennedy/status/949688651058835456) Glyph has [written](https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2018/01/shipping-pygame-mac-app.html) about this at length... not surprising to find out GUI stuff with Python is really, really lacking. It's a shame really. I think Ruby has a better GUI story than Python despite Pythons incredible growth and popularity. 
Cool! Thanks Almenon. How do you like IFTTT?
Non-array primitives are always small; a single int32 or float64 or what-have-you won't cause out of memory exceptions unless you allocate them in the...billions? A really big number. C is compiled, so the compiler chooses when memory is and isn't allocated. Keep in mind that static allocation is always faster, but the distinction of python/CPython vs C is that python doesn't know what's coming next, so relatively little (super-common ints like [-5,255] apparently) are about the limit of what can be preallocated. I don't know if any other interpreted languages do or don't have static memory allocation; I only have relative "expertise" in python on that front.
+1 I do this all the time for my big company finance job, works like a charm.
Selenium is what you need. It is a python (among other programming languages) library where you can drive chrome with. You can program exact steps you would do manual with the mouse. Google 'selenium chrome driver' to get started. If you have specific questions, let me know. 
Awesome! Thanks so much!!!
Writing scripts to organize 40GB of pictures on SMB server at work. Plus importing new pictures. 
Landed a new job. Gonna be swamped on that one for the next foreseeable future.
I think [ConfigParser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html) would be the traditional way to handle this. Just put whatever configuration lines you want into a config file and you can read it from the file each time.
Because I use docker a .env works best. You can leverage multiple .env to make a master one to pull into your python program (which you then can access via os.environ.get("param_name")).
What exactly would you want to do? Most surveys check the IP so you can only fill in one per IP. 
Would this work to create a settings menu for an application to allow changing screen size etc.
There are other layouts. I've found that it's not THAT difficult to create anything I need with grid understanding a few of the positioning options, though. 
Assuming a project that's existed for a grand total of four months will be around or in any way useful or relevant twenty years from now is a laughable amount of either hubris or naivete.
It's a great idea but besides for monitoring my bot I don't have much use for it.
Still working on my journal program. It will be my first big project that I have done in Python or any language for that matter. The idea behind my program is to help me log my diary entries and have easy access to them. Right now my program is CLI but I'm going to add a basic GUI with tkinter. I am using SQLite to store the diary entries and access them.
Congrats. What kind of job?
Seemed like the simplest tl;dr I could do.
What is dark data?
Absolutely no reason to run Python under Git Bash
Not directly, ConfigParser is just for reading/writing config files. But if you created a settings menu and wanted to persist those settings between restarts of your program, it would help with that, and the resulting file would still be very human readable and consistent with the standard config files that most other major programs use.
If you want to go the pure python route and avoid the dictionary noise, depending on what version of python you're on you could use data classes or named tuples. Staying with python would mean you could leverage the refactoring and navigation features of your IDE, if you use one On another note, if you have a bunch of values relevant to a task, you might be better off bundling everything into a class. And instead of referring to different settings files, just instantiate or create new classes But most importantly, since this is a commercial project, please write tests
So would you recommend the use of this to store the values for the screen size and other settings?
I have been working on a toy programming language to help me learn concepts before rolling into my compilers class. At work I mostly code in F# and some C#. However, I decided to go with python for my toy language. I find I tend to write python in a very non OOP style. Is this good practice? What are the merits of using classes in python? Python makes data manipulation so easy that I haven’t felt the need to use anything more complicated than lists and tuples. 
That would be awesome. Thanks!
It really just depends on your application and what else you have going on. If your program already has some other place where it stores things, it might not make sense to create a second file for configurations. If you are going to have a configuration file, ConfigParser is I think the most standard way to do that.
Honestly that is fine, because doing just one a day would be fine. I was also wondering if it would be easier by sending POST requests with the data put in. But idk
Or you could look at it like an admirable design goal. Consider the other end of the spectrum where the api changes as fast as it takes to learn the thing. The statement probably wasn't intended as a prediction of the future. 
Does this have anything on Cactus? Cactus is not under much development, but I have maintained a static Cactus site for 2 years, and it just works..

This [visualization](https://jmcle.github.io/rabbitmq-visualizer/) was really helpful for me, along with documentation, when I was starting with RabbitMQ.
Right, so there are pros and cons to everything. If you store the configuration stuff in the sqlite database then everything is nice and neat and nobody has to go off and find different files. But on the con side, if they do go looking it would be a huge pain for them to actually change the settings manually in a sqlite. ConfigParser would be the opposite of both of those.
For inspiration you could look at this page. https://martin-thoma.com/configuration-files-in-python/ It describes different possibilities.
&gt; ... which would make my code not look quite as clean as if I didn’t separate them out (ie params[‘threshold_something’] vs threshold_somwthing) One solution would be to put all the variables into a seperate `settings.py` file, and import it like ``` from settings import * ``` from the files that want to use them. That would put your settings into the global namespace and from there just call them as you please.
I’m just weary of global for everything, I know my program is isolated and small enough so it won’t impact it really but still I’m not sure I’d be happy with my work looking like that. In my college days I wouldn’t even have bothered putting them in a file and just have a bunch of globals at the head of my script haha.
Are you familiar with Fabric's env variable? It's very neat and clean way to store settings. Either use Fabric itself, or if that's not a good idea, create a similar entity. The hard-coded settings can be set in a config or yaml file. Config files are best loaded with SafeConfigParser in python2 or ConfigParser in python3 (same thing). Then feed the settings into the env variable. Again, when writing scripts, consider Fabric/Fabric3. 
Gonna start working on forecasting customer turnouts at a business using Python. That is for my capstone project with a course that I am taking.
Data classes are only supported in 3.7 - which still hasn't been fully released. There's a backport available, but it only works in CPython 3.6.
cool, thanks. if i can't find a project file library a gantt chart library might have to do. 
Yeah, same here :) And really depending on the size/scope of the project, that can be okay. But I agree for the most part. Another approach that avoids globals is to make a config class kinda like so .. class Config: setting1 = 1 setting2 = "something" ... Then you can call it with dot syntax `Config.setting1` to get at your settings, and since the variables are class scoped, you don't need to create an instance first.
You could try MPXJ in IronPython (.NET), in Jython (Java) or with Py4J.
Your code is asking whether the sex is unequal to the list of strings: `['Male','Female']` but what you want to check is whether the sex is `in` the list of string `['Male','Female']`. Try: DJ_df2['Sex'].loc[ DJ_df2['Sex'] not in ['Male', 'Female'] ] = 'Other'
Wouldn't it be more useful to just create a Python-protocol on top of MessagePack that can encode native Python types, as user-defined MsgPack types? I mean one of the main reasons for using serialization tools like JSON and MessagePack is that they are ubiquitous. https://msgpack.org/ Having it for only one language is already very limiting.
This was more of a challenge for myself rather than trying to up-end Messagepack. This is just the write-up to share with others! Also since I'm one person and worked on this for only a few days I don't think I could have implemented Mashpack in more than one language. :) And Python already trivially has that capability to encode objects into Messagepack. Pickle/Marshal+Ext would work perfectly.
Are you at work?
I don't believe I mentioned the word array anywhere. Fixed the semantics on github. Post title is "Plot a histogram in bash from a &lt;b&gt;list&lt;/b&gt; of numbers." Hopefully ppl on reddit can the semantics out for themselves.
Try /r/learnpython. That is the appropriate sub and you may have more luck.
Anyone know how to connect with sqlalchemy to a netezza server?
The word array is in your code: &gt; hist_array = [] &gt; neg_array = [] - &gt; Its 2018, I just assume everyone is using python3 at this point. I wish, but it's not even 50%. Most big companies are stuck in python2, often not even 2.7. 
Love that beautiful soup
&gt; Its 2018, I just assume everyone is using python3 at this point. Unfortunately no. I still use it at work. There's just not a particularly compelling reason to update. We'll update the day after numpy drops Python 2 support. It's generally very easy to support Python 2 and 3 with a single codebase and people use it, so without a compelling reason... The only reason my code and my open source library work with Python 3 is because 5% of the time, I have a file with a latin1 encoding and I'd like my code to not utterly die. It's unfixable with just Python 2. However, once I fix it, it works on Python 2, so we're back to no reason to upgrade.

Tkinter is really not bad. As with any GUI library, you deal with integration pain, but as far as python libraries go, it is stable and can be relied on. For many use cases, it performs just fine, even if it it does have native widgets. Using sizers can be learned in a few hours with practice.

Hey I'm the author of that post. I agree with you, there is a whole lot more to cover. Keep your eyes peeled! A followup is already in the editing stages that does use Selenium and a headless browser to deal with dynamic content. Thanks for reading :)

This is the first time I hear of fabric3. I thought development in fabric was stopped in favour of invoke. But I've never really followed either as fabric works quite well. If I find time I'll read up on that tomorrow...
Thanks for the super detailed information. 
Define easier to get going? Easy to learn Kivy, other things I'm still figuring out.
I work with config files a *lot*. Important influences on your choice are: * Who will edit the config files? * Developers of the project/script * Sysadmins who install/deploy the script? * End users of the script * When will you need to make changes to the config values? * At runtime (often) * During development only * Only sporadically * Do you need multiple different configurations for the same installed application? And, do you switch these... * ... at runtime? * ... at startup? * ... depending on the user running the application? * ... depending on the current working folder? * ... I'm currently in bed, falling half asleep, I'll follow up on this tomorrow... my eyes burn...
Do you have any links for the practical issues you mentioned? I would certainly appreciate it if you shared anything that would be helpful for those cases. Especially selenium tips and tricks, and distributed/asynchronous solutions. I have some ideas but would like to see what others have done and would recommend.

"Cracking Codes with Python" is the new edition of "Hacking Secret Ciphers with Python", this time published by No Starch Press with a professional editing job. This book is for complete beginners and assumes no programming experience, with examples of classic ciphers and how to break them. (Though if you do know Python, you might get a kick out of the cipher programs in it.) The Creative Commons license makes it free to read online.
At a glance, it seems to bring together Requests and BS4 so that the process of crawling is in one step.

Hi, I'm currently looking for remote work. You can find my information on my site http://dvs.io I've worked with Python for over 10 years now and have experience with all the major frameworks. Currently learning some React.js for fun so if your projects need some front end, I'm very interested! 
He literally says &gt;I can use without thinking about for the next twenty years
Thank you for the explanation. Makes sense now.
I'd also suggest JSONschema. It is ugly at first, but you can use a wrapper generator which gives you: * nice dot notation (x.y.z) * value validation And you can event get UI editors for them (I wrote one, wouldn't rely on it commercially though ;))

What kind of game is it and what is it currently built on? I'd look at alternatives to Pygame. While it's still maintained it is old and imo, holding gamedev back in Python. Look at Kivy, Pyglet, Cocos2d or Python Arcade. http://arcade.academy/
I've tried Kivy but it's a whole framework that requires a lot of learning too, using a lot of python stuff I'm unfamiliar with. I've tried pygame very slightly, and in 30 minutes I'm already passed where I was in 4 hours with kivy. The game is a gravitational N body simulator currently written in raw JavaScript using HTML canvas. There are no graphics, just white shapes, but it can be computationally expensive if there is a lot of objects on screen and a lot of physics calculations.

Neat
Hey all, the app that I am building (screenshots of UI are also available at the link) is used to identify large buy / sell-walls on the cryptocurrency exchange GDAX thanks to the python API they have set up. My 2 big questions are as follows (calling all Python / Dash coders for their advice): 1 - How do I go about automating the data pull so that it doens't require manual refresh. I essentially just need some code that automates the data pull every second (or, if that's too hard, does it whenever there is a manual refresh via the browser). 2 - How do I host this publicly so that everyone else can use it? (I don't have experience publishing Dash apps, so any advice would be great.) 
Developer. I'm helping build some financial risk analysis tools and then going to guide the design behind the machine learning platform.
I’m working on my first coding project. Var1name = raw_input(“Name “) Var2age = raw_input(“Age “) Var3sex = raw_input(“Gender “) Then print variables separated by a comma and space. Which is complete. I’m trying to figure out how to store the inputs like I would in an excel sheet. Not part of my project I just want to know. 
I'd be inclined to do that with bash, curl and wget. That's old school link scraping that's well document online.
Second for YAML. Gets read in as a dictionary. Easy to work with and is definitely a lot cleaner than JSON
if it's `f(x())` meaning that the `x` is executing and the return value is passed to `f`, then `f` won't run. The error in `x` will stop things cold and start traveling up the execution stack looking for a `try/except` block. If there is none, the whole program stops running. If it was `f(x)` as in the `x` funciton is passed into `f` and `f` calls `x`, then `f` will run until it calls `x`. At that point, the "traveling up the execution stack" in the previous paragraph applies.
Any interest in doing it in exchange for the subscription? :D
I can't get scrapy to work :(
ConfigParser is one way to handle it, I've also seen people store configs in JSON format, then load it into a script via json.loads(). 
I’m a beginner with python and programming (~ 9 months in, part time). This is likely the most helpful post I’ve come across (actually thought I was in /r/learnpython for a moment.), but not only for web scraping. I’ve struggled with web scraping (using Beautiful Soup) mainly because I never quite understood the underlying processes. This post immediately “threw the switch” in that regard. But more importantly, in my novice opinion, this post highlighted basic programming (or maybe just python?) processes that are always skipped over in other introductory material. For example, simply creating the mathematicians.py file with a couple functions and **then calling those functions** in the interactive interpreter for testing. I realize some at this point some are rolling their eyes, but fuck me if the dozen intro to python courses/reads/tutorials never taught this. I’ve only used the print function. Anyways, thanks man. I’m saving this for future reference. 
Why not just try it?
You know the basics now so you can start to branch out to more niche subjects. You could start using different modules like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, etc. for data analysis. Maybe start learning more advanced programming techniques like object orientated programming. You could start diving into machine learning with Tensorflow, web scraping, building GUIs and webpage development with Django. It really all depends on what you want to do with Python and why you are learning it. Here are some other projects that come to mind: * Chatbot * Reddit bot * Analyze financial markets * Contribute to Github projects * Machine Learning * Web scraping/ crawling * Make games with Pygame * Program a Raspberry Pi There was a competition that closed recently called Halite. It would be a good fun way to do some programming. Keep an eye out for when the competition opens again. I would also suggest checking out Sentdex's YouTube channel for some other ideas.
Cheers friend!
I’m excited to see what you release!
That's amazing. I'm an aspiring developer. Some day I'd love to be in your shoes. If you don't mind me asking what kind of education did you have to land such a job. You don't need to answer I'm just trying to find out what most people have.
Making mayzja-animate, an animation library.
I personally decided I wanted the ability to run python in my input script. First of all, anyone who is using my programs is presumed to already have shell access so security against a pathological input is not needed. And second of all, in reality, I am the only one using my scripts! I really wanted this so I could define conditions inside the config that are outside the program's logic (for example, different paths for different machines). With that, I've done this two ways have been conflicted on which I prefer: The first is to `exec` the document and then `setattr` to set attributes. This makes it easier to set defaults and do some automated work. Also it is easier to read the file from an arbitrary path. The downside is, if I change any attributes, I either need to make sure my other modules import the changed object from the main module or track the path and apply the same processing The second approach is to import `settings.py` or whatever. To do this on an arbitrary path, I have to make sure to add it to `sys.path` (though there may be other ways). Then, I can import it from any file and monkey-patch it. As long as I do not reload, I can reference the changes or set values. The downside is, it is harder to deal with defaults and also less able to have custom methods. But, both give me the ability to have dynamic config files!
This looks like a great read! 
I had to drop my last quarter of school (BSc Computer Science) due to life and money. So I haven't finished, I haven't worked or been in school for almost two years since I've been needing to get my feet back under me, so this new position is fucking huge for me and an absolute diamond in the rough. I do want to go back and finish off my degree because it's foolish for me not to at this point. And because I want to finish a Math degree and take a shot at grad school for Functional Analysis, Algebraic Topology, Machine Learning Stuff, or whatever I'm most mentally fit for.
That's amazing. I believe in you !!! You seem like a good person. Do you think I can make it too lol

I wouldn't go this route -- eksy is dead...the MSI part is a bit "meh" to me as well ---- Here's what I roll.

&gt; Is it faster to re-use an existing list in a for loop, or appending to an empty one? It sounds irrelevant. Those sound like very different tasks. &gt; Is it faster to use list comprehension or a for loop when the operation you need to perform only requires a single function call? What about a numpy array? The answers are different, but generally a list comprehension and also the answer is nearly the same, so it doesn't really matter. &gt; When is it faster to use a for loop than list comprehension It's more about is the code easy to read with a double list comprehension and if statements. Also, you could have done two things in that for loop instead of two similar list comprehensions. &gt; When is it faster to use list comprehension than map? Map is weird and almost always unnecessary. &gt; Q6. Is a lambda function faster than a regular function? No. All your questions are related to performance and Python honestly doesn't care about performance for almost every application. It just doesn't matter in Python. Debating x is faster than y, when both are dog slow doesn't really matter. If you want speed, go to a different language, be it Cython, PyPy, Python with some C for the critical bits, some other compiled language, or if you're doing math numpy.
I'd use curl. https://www.lifewire.com/example-uses-of-the-linux-curl-command-4084144 
Rad! Many thanks! Depends on how far you currently are. **Learn *software engineering* and build projects that reflect it.**Nowadays you want to know about Microservices, Monoliths, API development, Frontend development, Continuous Integration, Hypervisors / VMs / containers, and TDD stuff. Those are the topics that hold the most weight. Being able to sneeze out kruskals algorithm in java is cheap and flashy circus trick compared to building a scale-able, tested, and dead simple API. **Pickup a subfield of computer science that you find super interesting.** This will make it feel more like a hobby and passion than shitty classwork. I didn't know I would love machine learning until I took artificial intelligence with the "easy A" professor. I later took my Machine Learning and Data Mining Courses with the hardest professors and kicked ass. So poke and prod around if you are unsure like me. This will also help you look into grad school possibilities. **Rack up Internship experience as early as you can**. This will make applying for your next internship significantly easier. Prime case of the snowball effect, and "the best time to plant a tree is yesterday" or something along those lines. Just make sure you meet *most* of the internship requirements.
timeit is your friend. 
Are you new to programming, or just new to Python? pyglet has good support for event driven programming, so custom UI buttons are fairly easy to do. Joystick support is also available. I'd have a look through this game guide here, even if you're not making a game: https://pyglet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/programming_guide/examplegame.html 
Woah. This is probably the coolest tutorial I've seen! This is awesome.
basically only i the developer will edit the values. they at worst case will need to change config values for different clients, but in best case one set fits all. the changes would never be made at run time and only during development. they will be loaded when the device turns on and then never changed.
&gt; This is probably the coolest tutorial I've seen! Feel free to say so as often as you like.:)

It sounds to me that the virtual environment was not properly loaded, hence why the package was installed at the system level. Thus far, the best way that I have found to manage multiple versions of python and virtual environments is through `pyenv`. Basically you can installed multiple versions of python without touching your system's python [Here is a comment I made about it a while back.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/6wfgfz/d_would_anyone_be_interested_in_a_machinelearning/dm81adj/) Furthermore, pyenv already comes with a virtualenv plugin, so creating a virtual environment is as easy as: pyenv virtualenv 3.6.1 meh which follows the recipe: pyenv virtualenv &lt;python-version&gt; &lt;name of environment&gt; you can visualize all the virtualenvironments installed in your machine with pyenv virtualenvs And lastly you can load the virtual environment with pyenv shell meh # pyenv shell &lt;name of environment&gt; good luck

For rabbitmq, there's also routing keys, which can be pretty handy. A lot re choice of mq system depends on whether you need some kind of broker system, eg for handling store and forwards for you (eg, both apps don't need to be online at the same time, or they can just poll every now and then for new events), or splitting queues based on routing keys, that kind of thing. One place I've used RabbitMQ a fair amount is for the "store and forward (with this routing key)" semantics. You can also find a fair amount on google by searching for "rabbitmq vs reddis". Also a reminder that RabbitMQ supports a STOP protocol plugin, which can be easier for things like web services to work with, compared to the regular AMQP protocol.

Working on addon python scripts for XBMC/Kodi, for highly custom and dynamic UIs. We're using XBMC/Kodi, and some custom hardware in a way that was never intended. This specific system is more or less about people in an audience with remote controls in response to various multimedia being played in XBMC. And all of that tied into a highly custom Moodle-like implementation. I'm more or less forced to use Python 2 in this case, for Kodi/XBMC addon compatibility.

Sounds like you want a serialization format, ie some way you could save the data to disk in a tabular format, possibly have humans view or edit that (eg in Excell), and then later on be able to read that data from disk. In that case you'll probably be best served by the "csv" Python module: https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html 
My apologies! I'm on mobile, I'll redo it when I get home.

Are you sure you want to match the range from / to _ ? If you want a group to contain the minus sign, you need to place it at the beginning of the group: `[-a-zA-z\/_]` You probably also want to ad a literal dot `\.` to your match groups, if you want to match the sample input.
All this removes a lot of the potential complexity. You don't need to worry about faulty user-input (no validation is needed). And given that it will only be developers editing the config files, I assume they will be edited before packaging and deploying the app. This means you could bundle the config *with* your application and you are pretty much free to do whatever you want. This is actually a question I forgot yesterday: How do you package/deploy your application? In the case you package it the standard way (using a `setup.py` and creating `sdists` or `wheels`), I believe the easiest solution is to put the values into a separate Python module inside your package and just import as needed. This however has the downside to re-package and re-deploy when your values change. But the way it sounds to me is that the config values are actually integral to the proper functioning of the application, and you could argue that incorrect config-values mean that the application does not work as intended and needs to be re-packaged (with an increment in version number). Storing the config values as a Python module inside the package has the advantage that you can leverage the standard Python data-types, don't need any third-party library and don't need an extra parsing/loading step as all the values are already there (loading becomes trivial). This will also give you the flexibility of avoiding dictionaries as you see fit.
This is our regular London-based Python Data Science Open Source conference, this year it grows to 500 attendees. All proceeds go to the non-profit NumFOCUS who support the well known data science tools (pandas, numpy, matplotlib etc), the local organising team are all volunteers. We're keen to accept more first-time speakers this year, the mentorship programme has been expanded to help make that a reality. See https://www.youtube.com/user/PyDataTV for examples of talks at other PyData conferences. We'd love to get proposals from folk on Reddit who can make it to London!
Thank you! I also needed to increase the timeout for it to give the correct answer. 
This looks great! Unfortunately I don't have much to offer in the way of content, but definitely interested in attending when tickets/schedule are available.
Git does work on Windows. You can use it with powershell if you want.

I want to say "I don't care what resolutions are available, choose the best one that's no bigger than N vertical pixels, or the smallest one available if none meet that criteria." Basically, I'd like to be able to say `youtube-dl --resolution 720p http://example.com/video` and have it ignore the oversized 1080p version that's available. I can sort of do this now in a two pass way with -F and then -f, but it's not the simple invocation I'd like.
Can't believe it's really you! I was introduced to programming with automate the boring stuff, and you are incredible! 
I just started my first repo in GH, too. How are you liking GHs usabity? I find it a bit clunky but I'm still new to it and I figured I'd ask someone else new, as well. What's the app do?
Thanks, really appreciate it! 2 quick follow-ups: 1 - Where does 'output-div-id' come from? (I thought it might be the id of the graphs created in display_your_graph(n) but given that it comes prior I doubt that. 2 - What is the meaning of "**kwargs" in the first def and "n" in the second def--are those placeholders for what could be blanks or do they actually have meaning intrinsic to python/dash. Appreciate the help a bunch! 
pyglet lacks built in widgets and buttons. There are some libraries for this, such as Glooey, and Simplui, but it's not in core. Kivy is also a fantastic library.
Overall the code looks very nice, easy to read and well documented. So +1 on that. As far as the problem goes, since Google has the "I'm feeling lucky" thing, this could be very short cause the behaviour of going to the first result is built-in. import requests from requests import utils url = 'https://www.google.com/search?q={query}&amp;btnI=1'.format(query='lucky number one') response = requests.get(utils.requote_uri(url)) with open('result.html', 'w') as output: output.write(response.text) With some additional validation and user input of course, but you get the gist. ---- I'll go over a couple of your methods and give you my 2cents: **user_input** -- This sounds like a regex job for me: import re pattern = '^[a-z\d\s]+$' user_input = 'abdalf134 1234kjdfsal' valid = re.match(pattern, user_input, re.IGNORECASE) is not None (\d = digits, \s = whitespace) Now, sticking closer to your solution, Id write valid = all([char in screen for char in user_input]) if valid: ... **parse_url** -- *Apart from appending to the base google url.* What you do there is basically url encoding. The requests lib does this automatically for you, so this isn't really necessary. And if you do want it, it's probably smart to use the pre-built functions of either the `requests` lib or `urllib`. ---- Everything else looks very good. It's pretty code.
I second a Reddit bot. I'm a seasoned programmer that broke into Python by starting with a Reddit bot using PRAW. It's extremely easy and, for me at least, allowed me to actually learn and use Python far better than Codecademy. There are plenty of examples on GitHub and on the PRAW documentation guide. Figured since we're here, it's probably most appropriate, right? :) Site scraping is another easy task. Pull info from a site but practice parsing and iterating through objects by targetting specific data only. Then output it to a file so you get familiar with IO and file system interfacing. Good luck!
I tried to give you gold for being so pleasant and helpful with a newb but found out I'd have to pay for it. :D I've bookmarked this answer and plan to: - Work on my code to add the regex and the generator you suggested, (I already know about regexes and generators and just didn't think to use them). - read up on the libraries you've referred to and experiment with them - rethink the goal of this project to see if it can go anywhere beyond practice at code, style, and versioning - keep an eye open for problems I notice that I think I'm already competent to try to solve and see if I can start another project Any suggestions as to what else I could do?
You could distribute pre-compiled binaries as wheels. 
it appears you didn't source your virtualenv run: which pip and see where the pip file it's running. You should also see your env variable in the shell (myenv) ~]# source your env with source /path/to/env/bin/activate.sh 
Where is the correct place to report errata?
Why not simply `-f bestvideo[height&lt;=?720]+bestaudio/best[height&lt;=?720]` ?
I started by stumbling on an old (2007) book in my distro's repositories that did a fabulous job of explaining version control to me through analogy (the analogy was saved games in computer gaming). Once that sank in I figured out the commands pretty quickly, and git's warnings and error messages are great at telling me how what I learned is out of date, in a way I can understand. Plus I don't know anything about other version control systems or graphical tools for doing version control. tl;dr there are reasons why I don't find git clunky at all. :D What I really do like is the ability to take a remote down or simply make it private. Nobody wants to advertise their training wheels once they've been taken off. But I don't know if other remote services have that feature too.
&gt; it appears you didn't source your virtualenv run: Guilty as charged. Live and learn.

I'm not sure if it is the best way to start, but if I were you, I would begin by recreating the bat-scripts functionality in Python. That way you know what the end result should look like and you can check if your Python scripts work. In the process you've gained more Python skills and you can start doing more complex stuff.
I may have some time to look into it for the right price but what data exactly do you need extracted from the webpage? 
I'm familiar with scrappy and am interested in this job if it's still available.
Thanks I'll look into it.
Perhaps you should even take a step further back and start with the Python basics. I'm also in the process of learning Python and started with the Python courses on Codecademy. Then converted some existing (manual) tasks to a Python script and so on.
Thanks for the advice, does codeacademy teach python 3.6? I am not sure about differences in version but i dont want to confuse myself if there are major differences in commands and the like
I think it is actually Python 2.X, but the basics are almost the same. The only difference I noticed so far between what I've learned from the Codecademy courses and scripting in Python 3.6 afterwards is print 'text' vs print('text').
