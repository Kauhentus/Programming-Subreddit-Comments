https://www.etcconnect.com/uploadedFiles/Main_Site/Content/Support/Articles/Consoles/Legacy_Consoles/2677%20Serial%20Button%20Protocol.pdf The Button protocol sits on top of RS232, so presumably you're intending to use a serial over lan adapter. Wrapping that serial connection inside ssh (or telnet) is popular, so I'd recommend port 22 (or 23).
This should be the recommend solution, and not reshape. In this case you don't need the array sizes along different axes. Just a note that `np.squeeze(x)` can also be used as `x.squeeze()` in an OO way
Where you say 'better constructs exist that can do the same thing' what sort of alternative would you suggest?
I've tried that
/u/Phail3d had great points. I’d like to add, get the README.md in order. That is the first thing any developer looks at on a github repo and it tells a lot about a project. If it is untamed like yours, you are going to get a lot of devs turning away and not wanting to help. 
Looks like you would enter something like 2000 into scan() and then it would attempt 2000-2100
I have no idea what this is, but looking at the code examples, you use `hash` as a variable name which is also a python built-in. You should change that
On this note, why does dict have a copy method but list does not?
So lets say that you have the following: ``` player_speed = 10 player_x = 0 player_y = 0 def move_left(): global player_x player_x -= 1 def main(): ... while True: if &lt;left arrow pressed&gt;: move_left() ... ``` The issue with this is that you can no longer tell what the function `move_left` does just by looking at its parameters and return value, because now it also has the implicit dependency on the global `player_x` variable. A better way to formulate this could be: ``` def move_left(current_player_x): return current_player_x - 1 def main(): ... player_x = 0 player_y = 0 while True: if &lt;left arrow pressed&gt;: player_x = move_left(player_x) ... ``` Or, using a more object oriented approach: ``` class Player: def __init__(self, x, y): self.x, self.y = x, y def move_left(self): self.x -= 1 def main(): ... player = Player(x=0, y=0) while True: if &lt;left arrow pressed&gt;: player.move_left() ... ``` What these both have in common is that the state that is mutated doesn't just live in some global variables, but it's instead moved into either function-scoped variables or instance variables inside a class. Note that this doesn't actually mean that all global variables are bad per se. One good use for global variables are constants that don't change for the runtime of the program. For an instance, it in this case it could be useful to create a global variable called `PLAYER_SPEED = 1` and do `player_x -= PLAYER_SPEED` instead of `player_x -= 1`. 
 my_list[:]
Have you tried any of the variations on it? Mini-batch kmeans is significantly faster and still produces pretty good results. 
Some global variables really are global variables. But some are really functioning as a member variable of some large object. For instance, some would create a `Game` object and set these as properties of that object.
If you're gunna use separate files there's not much point in using functions. Also you have a ton of unnecessary parentheses
I've not tried any other algorithms. My application required very fast upadte times, I was taking a screenshot, running kmeans on a scaled down image (for speed) and displaying the major color on an LED strip. My target was 30hz update time. The best I got with decent color results was 10hz. If I get a chance I'll look into mini-batch, thanks for the tip.
This sounds like a fun way to learn a lot. When it's a bit further along, you should come back and point it out again. Good luck!
Looks great :) just a footnote.. When you're setting true/false values, use actual booleans e.g. True and False One benefit of this is that instead of using: if foo="true": [code] else: [code] You can use this: if not foo: [code] else: [code] Just some python syntax sugar a newbie might enjoy ;)
Seems like the author wants to do mathematical visualizations in 3D. Then OpenGL, Blender, and Panda3D fall quite short. I am not sure this package is the solution I need, but at least it seems to aim for a niche that seriously needs some attention.
Matplotlib has a 3D renderer, but it is honestly not very good. It doesn't do occlusions/zbuffering, to take one really annoying example. Mayavi from enthought is quite good, but requires VTK and is therefore sometimes hard to install. Visualizations look nice though, although it is quite slow for certain workloads. There is also VisPy, but I found it unusable for making figures that look good enough for a paper. YMMV if you have better OpenGL drivers than I have.
And using real booleans is more memory efficient. &gt;&gt;&gt; import sys &gt;&gt;&gt; sys.getsizeof("True") 53 &gt;&gt;&gt; sys.getsizeof(True) 28 The `sys.getsizeof()` function returns the size in bytes of an object. Strings uses almost twice as memory as Booleans.

Something important about games as opposed to tools is that a program crash is far less acceptable. If you were writing a calculator and that calculator would crash if you entered a letter instead of a number, that's irritating, but not the end of the world. If I'm playing a game and accidentally mash two buttons in a menu selection, causing the game to crash, I'm probably never going to play again. As you get it fleshed out, I recommend learning about try/except blocks for user input validation. Paired with while loops, you can take user input that will wait until they input something legal instead of just crashing. 
I’m being taught python right now as my friend and I make a text based game. It’s a great way to learn or refine skills.

Sorry to leave you hanging! I should have put a final code block in there. It's actually pretty straightforward. If you pass `passive_deletes=True` to the `relationship` call, SQLAlchemy will allow the database to handle the cascades. There is a small caveat, apparently, in that objects that are currently loaded in the session will still be deleted using the recursive ORM method. Here's a link to the docs, as it captures all of the details better than I can: [http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/collections.html#using-passive-deletes](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/collections.html#using-passive-deletes)
Hey this is awesome, I recently started the exact same project myself very much as a beginner (1st year computer science student only completed one unit of Python), I’ll definitely be keeping an eye on your progress (:
oh awesome, ill definitely bookmark!! :)
I see a price of ~3 dollars
Most of what you'll need is in this book (which you can read online for free) https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ It teaches from a non-programmer perspective and have a basic python tutorial which I recommend on following to start with.
Also r/learnpython
Why python 2.7?
Noob question, how to run the project? I have atom/pycharm installed
After reading some comments I have implemented a K-means clustering method to make the package much more functional.
I have since implemented clustering. Thank you!

What is Python doing to one bit of information to make it take up half the size of a string 
You only need two things: /r/learnpython and its sidebar google. eg: "Python read PDF". "Python write to excel". etcetera...
Terrible advice. If I build a model with products and product_rows with a FK product_id to reference the first table, how would I handle actual hard deletes without ON DELETE CASCADE? Not all actions are user events - you need to be able to actually clean up the db somehow.
Perhaps since a copy can be achieved as easily as `list2 = list1 + []`?
An excellent source of information. Concise and to the point. All Freshers aiming to learn Python should give it a look. Good writing. Kudos. 
This post is better suited for r/learnpython and r/learnprogramming
This post is better suited for r/learnpython
&gt; Of course, ideally OP would implement Median Cut color quantization but that algo is a pain to implement by hand. I read this and I wondered how hard it could actually be. Turns out it wasn't bad at all. It was * Get all the pixels in an image * Find the color channel that had the largest range in values * Sort pixels on that color channel You just keep splitting that list until you have however many colors you want. Then just average the pixels. [Here's the code](https://github.com/Stack-of-Pancakes/median_cut_color_quantization) in case anyone wanted to take a look. I included a couple same images with the output colors. 
Everything in Python is an object. A `bool` is actually a subclass of `int`, so even though its "just" a bool, its still an entire object. &gt;&gt;&gt; a = True &gt;&gt;&gt; b = 1 &gt;&gt;&gt; sys.getsizeof(a) 24 &gt;&gt;&gt; sys.getsizeof(b) 24 &gt;&gt;&gt; type(a) &lt;type 'bool'&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; type(b) &lt;type 'int'&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; help(a) Help on bool object: class bool(int) | bool(x) -&gt; bool | | Returns True when the argument x is true, False otherwise. | The builtins True and False are the only two instances of the class bool. | The class bool is a subclass of the class int, and cannot be subclassed.
Is it written using the PyGame framework?
can i add a brothel
Apparently a Bool in python is a subclass of Int ([Source](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/functions.html#bool)), so maybe it have all the same overhead of a Int. If you use `sys.getsizeof(1)` you get the same amount of used memory as in `sys.getsizeof(True)`
[Self-promotion](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion)
Its not self-promotion, im sharing article about python caching system for reddit users. Trying to be helpfull.
For a string it has to store the binary encoding of each character whereas with a Boolean it's just a true or false value, like a 1 or a 0. It's just simpler for the computer to 'understand' so it doesn't need as much relative data
I didn't know that was a function of sys, that's pretty cool :)
It is self-promotion because it is all you do. Regarding the votes: myself and at least one other have commented about the unusually high number of votes your topics receive just at the beginning of their lifetime, only to dwindle shortly thereafter. It could be genuine interest; it could also be what is known to be a clear sign of vote manipulation.
Wrote and set up a quote scraping script at PythonAnywhere. The script uses Flask, takes user input, scraps quotes from a website and returns a CSV.
Oh, cool.. let me look into that.
Thank you, earthboundmisfit :)
Good feedback. I'll look into updating the folder structure.
Thank you :)
What I mean is that the string "True" is several bytes in size. I'm surprised that True is even close to half its size. 
Thanks for the feedback, u/not_perfect_yet. Your name was a nice prologue to your comment :) For my claim of pov ray being the "best" open source option, the "best" is of course subjective. But I'll look into editing that line. For documentation, I'd be happy to try and add some. Which format would you prefer? Like a web link with documentation on the classes and methods or more comments in the code?
I personally like youtubers Corey Shaffer, Dan Bader and Sentdex, nice variety of tutorial topics. 
Ohh, I get you. I have no idea tbh I guess its still inherently a data type so the memory is probably majorly taken up by the addresses of functions and methods that initialise it as a datatype
Thank you :) I'd be happy to share some of these gifs on platforms where people are expecting them, so this is informative.But, when I go to theintergalacticjetset.tumblr.com: it says "nothing here". 
/r/learnpython 
Thanks for the feedback, Eryole. Where should I add documentation? This is my first python library (or in any language) so I'm very keen on feedback.
Sorry, here is the correct url: http://intergalacticjetset.tumblr.com
Thanks for the encouraging words, aroberge. For making planes and intersections, check out the second example in my README. I'll add some comments to those methods in case you use them :)
&gt;Which format would you prefer? Like a web link with documentation on the classes and methods or more comments in the code? Something that shows your train of thought for intended use. Something that takes me step by step from a problem to a solution. You can put that in comments in the code, as a detailed example file into the repo, the readme or on a different website. Matplotlib has a very nice collection of examples: https://matplotlib.org/examples/mplot3d/contour3d_demo3.html 
I want to get started on parsing audio (mostly just voice). Anyone got any suggestions on where to start, or good packages?
Yes. Check out [Automate the Boring Stuff](http://automatetheboringstuff.com/).
So I should start an easier Github project (that's something I've struggled at, because I get put off, if I come across a git where there are some unfamiliar terms, or something new is required). Documentation building is something I feel I can do very well, but it has to come after I build at least useful piece code on my own. Imagine a somewhat new programmer, how would he go about learning a new library or API he is completely unfamiliar with? It is required by the project team. As far as I understand if I am able to use API's, I can build some practical applications. Normally, the documentation can get intimidating. 
Questions are better asked in r/learnpython (or questions like these, in r/learnprogramming , even). Yes, you can do this with Python. Should you learn Python? Not necessarily, there's other ways to do this.
Thanks for the reference. I'll look that up when I'm done with my Scheme interpreter. 
You can Google any terms you don't know. Even experienced developers are googling things and reading documentation all the time. In my experience the best developers aren't the ones who know the most about a topic but those who can learn new things quickly. As for learning APIs, different people learn different ways. Some people can read documentation and understand. Others need examples. Examples are definitely the easiest way I think because you can see exactly how to call the API and what you're going to get in return.
If you don't mind, may I know what kind of experience you have. There is so much misinformation/ half-information out there. 
Same question here
I skimmed around a bit, I would definitely love to help when I have time - seems like fun. I recommend the use of Classes. It would help out later down the line when creating multiple characters, items, and episodes. 
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar. Also google "python excel" Come on, dude.
Thanks men !
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython. We **highly encourage** you to re-submit your post over on there. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community is actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers. If you have a question to do with homework or an assignment of any kind, please make sure to read their sidebar rules **before** submitting your post. If you have any questions or doubts, feel free to reply or send a modmail to us with your concerns. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
I'm a new grad. For full disclosure I've only worked as a full-time engineer for 2 months. I interned at SpaceX in college for a total of 8 months. To be honest, SpaceX internships are more challenging and fast paced than my current job, which is at a government research and development center. The work at the R&amp;D center is full of lazy people who slack off and 10% of the company carries 80% of the work. At SpaceX I wrote code that currently flies on the Dragon 2 and Falcon 9/Heavy rockets as well as the ground infrastructure systems. I learned more at Spacex in a week than I have in two months at this job but whether you value my opinion is up to you as I am very young.
Raspbian comes with [Minecraft Pi](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-minecraft-pi/2) if I am not mistaken. Maybe that'd be fun if "plain" programming bores him \^\^
...oh don't think he hasn't noticed! :D He was actually pretty keen on using sonic pi for a bit of a break from things, or to mix things up a bit.
Pandas is a good module to look at for manipulation of excel data. I use it often for tasks like the one you're describing. You could also, in theory, use excel's built in visual basic. It has the advantages of being able to record macros so it's a little easier to cobble together something quickly, but I find it bogs down when handling large amounts of data. 
And so begins years of "expected an indent"
 dict(**mydict) Still doesn’t answer why one has it and the other doesnt
Slice it, squeeze it, or reshape it.
Thank you! It worked :D Thanks you all for your responses.
Given your description, `hug` sounds like the best choice: https://github.com/timothycrosley/hug
Hi, you should check out the Stack Overflow website, where you can post questions such as this one.
Thanks, I fully value your opinion. Senior developers are more or less annoyed by such questions and just tell you to study the basics. 
&gt;Come on, dude. OP did say it was a stupid question. 
&gt;Either drop the unnecessary In atom text editor you could install the package "atom-runner". Restart atom, navigate to the file you want to run and press ALT+r. 
Not at the moment but I don't think PyGame would make sense in this case as it's a text based game.
Man when he got to the pages in the book about error messages, I made sure he read it THOROUGHLY 😁
You're right. Shadowing builtin functions isn't nice. I'll fix it.
What framework did you use? I learn Python but in a web development basics with Flask and still exploring with Django. At some point I want to try making making games in the future.
https://zetcode.com/gui/pyqt5/
Not trying to discourage you but the entire project has to be rewritten - every single line. You need to be reading other people code to learn, not trying to open source and get contributors to this. Newbs contributing to this will learn only really awful techniques.
Yes! I work for a large firm in a department where they are at least ten years behind in terms of technology! So whenever I can, I offer cleaning data to any department I can connect with since no one else wants to do it manually lol.
Nice, thanks. Merging pdfs from command line is not very comfortable. 
You should try [Mu](https://codewith.mu/) if you're looking for something a bit more up to date than IDLE.
Which one did he get? 
It seems that your comment contains 1 or more links that are hard to tap for mobile users. I will extend those so they're easier for our sausage fingers to click!

[PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) is a very popular option, and it also has a designer (drag and drop, WYSIWYG). I've seen the name "PySide" being thrown around too, but I am not sure what it is precisely (Qt related, for sure). A less popular option is tkinter.
Good bot
I want to learn Python but I don’t have a working PC. I didn’t know Raspberries were powerful enough to code Python on. Do I need to get a certain edition/version?
The irony of a grammatical error in the title of a post about a text based game is amazing.
Revisiting how to create APIs with Flask then learning how to do it with DRF
Ok. And you're telling us because?
You might consider adding a casing convention to make the code easier to read. For example camelCase would work fine. Instead of: usableasweapon Say:usableAsWeapon It may seem like a small change now but reading and searching through it later when it’s larger will become difficult. You could also consider usable_as_weapon, or usable-as-weapon. Best of luck! Post again when you have more progress.
Because this is a forum for discussing Python.
Oh yeah? And what is it we’re discussing? Because I’m not sure what we’re talking about that was motivated by a stranger telling us they or someone they know used Python this one time. 
Not everything has to be a discussion.
I know this is an old post. But for anyone looking here, I wanted to mention how I dealt with the sensing issue. I used a wine cork stuck in the end of the rod and put a 10 turn variable resistor in the cork so as the door raised and lowered it changed the value of the resistor. This resistor is part of a voltage divider. By measuring the "divided" voltage using the analog pin on the ESP8266 I am able to determine the resistance and thus how far the resistor has turned. Thus I can measure pretty exactly how open the door is. Much better than magnetic switches, proximity switches, or ultrasonic range finders.
... it's awesome.
Yeah for real. Weird that reddit just allows all the shitty bots like a lot bot.

Seems like other people are pulling it off just fine lol
damn dude, what's wrong? 
The person literally just told me that this is a sub for discussing python and python related things. So take that up with them. 
This book made it easy for me to learn. Here is the author's youtube. [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0-84-yl1fUnRuXGFe\_F7qSH1LEnn9LkW](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0-84-yl1fUnRuXGFe_F7qSH1LEnn9LkW) Chapter 12 is the Excel Chapter.
You seem to have copied the code for your kmeans directly from [this website](https://zeevgilovitz.com/detecting-dominant-colours-in-python). I would recommend you cite the github project or website.
oh thats awesome! when I tried to port it from js to golang it was a real pain in the ass. Now i see it wasnt the algorithm, but the language themselves. Go python!
Would be a great bit if it just posted the links.
so sweet. that’s awesome
Appreciate the support and glad you liked the repo :)
I’m fine. Are you ok?
Heh. you should read the code. You'll find ironic is just the tip of the wtf iceberg.
Great! Surely your nephew will love the possibilities!
\+= is not "updating" a variable, is an augmented assignment. "Updating" to me would be a new = assignment. Its completely arbitrary like any high level computer programming language, but most likely to follow historical precedent. += is used in other programming languages. 
1: /r/learnpython 2: what is the difference between foo + 1 vs foo = foo + 1 vs foo += 1
I think he/she already realizes a += "something" is different than a + "something" He is asking WHY not HOW. Why is arbitrary and must be taken as axiom. It is simply the syntax of the language. 
I’m also a kid,I’m assuming your nephew is a kid, I love the raspberry Pi’s. I use mine for an emulator, but it is of the best things I’ve ever bought
Hey, the new version with screenshots looks really cool. Good job!
Good not
This post is better suited for r/learnpython 
This is interesting. Do you have any pictures? I'm having a hard time visualizing how full door travel is only 10 turns on a pot.
man: can't change directory to ''when" No such file or directory
Without agreeing with your tone, I do have to admit that posts like this make me regard this sub as a garbage pile compared to other language subs like /r/Java, /r/golang, etc 
See my other reply. Simplicity is not really a great argument. Importing copy isn’t hard. And nether is: dict(**mydict)
I didn't know tone was something you could agree upon. But that said, I feel like there was nothing wrong with my tone. I didn't insult anybody, or tell people that the content was useless. I asked what it is they want us to do with the information. If there's some valid reason that this content should be viewed as good and interesting then they can explain it. And if not, maybe they'll realize that it's not good or useful. But how else would you recommend getting that across without just explicitly telling people their content is pointless? 
What you are referring to is a Context Manager. I don't know if it's implemented in the 2 ways I talk about below, but if it's not already it's very easy to implement it yourself. See python [Data Model - Context Manager](https://docs.python.org/3.6/reference/datamodel.html#with-statement-context-managers) AFAIK python by itself "can't" open an .xls file and "understand" it just like a plain text file. You should use the `pywin32` module to properly manage an Excel file on windows (I don't think it has built in context manager). But I also saw that you can use the `pandas` module to do this. You should check Stackoverflow.com for more info on this.
As a general rule of thumb if it takes me more than 10 seconds to scroll through the file then it is too long. 2k lines is definitely at the point where you need to split the file up. Splitting it would increase readability and reduce complexity. https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/176999/at-what-point-range-is-a-code-file-too-big &gt; So a source file that is more than 2000 lines is probably too large and starting to be too messy. 
Sounds great. Will keep an eye on it :) 
have you tried [https://www.codecademy.com/](https://www.codecademy.com/)? imo, you're after a book. freecodecamp is essentially one big book online. 
This made my Monday morning :) 
How long before the jam starts does it get announced? Are the dates and topic announced at the same time?

I hesitate to continue this conversation but since you’ve decided to double down on your shitty tone, here goes: The sarcasm isn’t nearly as interesting as you seem to think it is. And to sit here and act like you aren’t being sarcastic, and pretend like you don’t know why you’re being down voted to hell, jeez you sound like a child bugging their sibling with the old “I’m not touching you” trick. “I didn’t insult anybody,” my ass. I have hope you’re just a kid with lots to learn, which is fine, we were all smart asses once. If you’re an adult, oof.
Wow, i am currently learning python and going through basic things. Making games will really help in learning the language and it would be fun. 
$ python3 hap.py :)
I was being sarcastic, but that's irrelevant. The point is that if it was defensible, then it could be defended. But it isn't, which is why nobody can/chooses to explain why the content is good. Whether or not I genuinely want someone to explain it to me or not is completely irrelevant. Because the issue is whether it can actually be explained why the content is good or not. It's genuinely fascinating how people view the world. According to you (and people who think like you), whether or not something is true or not somehow is intricately tied to the way in which someone asks questions about it. 
To clarify a little, hopefully, the python `open()` function can open any file in your filesystem that the permissions system allows. What you do with the contents is up to you. For instance, it's possible to open a Windows EXE file and write the bytes to the screen as sequence of decimal values using just basic python. But if you want to display assembler instructions you have to do a lot more work. So opening a file and interpreting the contents of the file are different things. There are many modules that help you with the interpretation part, but the "open" is easy.
To tell the unfiltered truth: \- the code is garbage. the project will never go anywhere \- to learn to code, start with small projects that you can finish; and then, grow.
noice! appears to have many of the attributes I love about apistar! got any sense of the differences there? Just get it into a stable state so I can convince my employer to use it!
Would that be better for someone who is not a novice at all? I mostly write code using Pycharm on my laptop, but occasionally make edits to scripts via the Pi that runs them.
Nope. I downvoted the post because I agree it wasn’t relevant to the subreddit. I just didn’t feel the need to be a sarcastic ass about that fact. You’re putting words into my mouth to defend yourself; if you were after truth like you claim, you’d admit to being a bit of an ass about this and move on, as I’m about to.
Hello, server mod here! We usually announce at least a month earlier and give people plenty of time to sign up. Dates are announced as soon we open up sign-ons. This one started on 25th of June and was announced 20th of May. The topics are only given out when the Jam starts so that people don't start early. We do give clues so you can be prepared and don't spend a significant amount of time getting things running. Eg. We announced the task this time would involve Flask and we had a qualifier to both help you set up your environment and ensure you know what you're doing. Hopefully that answered your question. See you during the next Code Jam!
Is It possible? 1000%. Is It already made not sure maybe. 
Thank you! Have any idea of where to start looking?
Freshers as in freshman? Unlikely unless you went to a crazy good school. Find non profit projects to work your way up. 90% of the “junior dev” jobs are flooded with newbies who can’t code. Find a side stack to jump in with like an AWS very. Stay away fro. The Indian recruiters as most of the jobs they have they claim are available... your resume is chaff used to make the real applicants look good. I submitted 128 resume to Indian reciters in 4 months as a fresher and not one turned into anything. I blacklisted Indian recruiters and went with English speaking and American named recruiters, then 12 applications later I was offered a job.
Python automate the boring things or the same author has stuff like this.
Yup.
That's fine. Nobody asked you to be a sarcastic ass. I'm not even sure why you're bringing that up.
Awesome. One of the better more useful bots. 
Well to say that in a nicer way, the project will likely never have any other contributors but if it helps you learn then that's all it really needs to achieve.
I have another question for you, if you know Linux. How was life in coding for you before and after learning linux. Did it make it easier to understand API's? 
I recommend PyCharm, Community Version is free for everyone. It's slick and effient with a beautiful user interface. 
Fortunately you can always google them!
Definitely possible. There are Python modules for manipulating both Word documents and PDF files so you have your choice for which format you want to template in.
Thanks! I tried to do that on the [motivation](https://moltenframework.com/motivation.html) page. I wanted more control over the component lifecycle (molten lets you define which components are cacheable (reused during a single request) and which are singletons), I think apistar’s hooks are super clunky and, as an apistar user myself, [this announcement](https://discuss.apistar.org/t/towards-an-api-star-based-service/533/4) kind of concerns me, especially after the huge 0.3 to 0.4 transition.
I've used `pandoc`, but didn't use its templates, although some people: http://karl-voit.at/2017/12/17/pandoc-docx-reference/ claim it to be possible.
If he liked Sonic pi, he might enjoy pure data. The documentation is hit or miss, but it's fun if he's into sound manipulation.
totes feel like a leet haxxor when editing a line of code in nano over ssh lol /s i get a lot of (good-natured) shit at my 2nd job for stuff like that (even just opening a terminal), i'm not sure anyone there has ever used anything outside of the start menu, office, or a browser
I'm kinda amazed how well (fast) they can run stuff. Way faster than I initially believed. Also, tip, if he wants 3.6 on the pi, [here](https://gist.github.com/dschep/24aa61672a2092246eaca2824400d37f) is a github gist outlining the process. Its like 6 steps. instead of make use make -j 4 Also, you may want a fan to point directly at the pi lol For all I know, you may know way more about this stuff than I do, but just wanted to throw it out there. The world of f-strings is wonderful! 
Well I'm telling you it's not. So there ya go.
For pi? 
Oh shit, just saw you post on /r/raspberry_pi
Historically, there were three (at least to my memory) attempts at organizing and structuring program development process. First was called six sigmas (referring to how standard deviation is usually denoted), it was about ensuring very good quality of the product. Very few people even remember the name, and, it seems like, it didn't do anything of note to the product quality. Next approach was called "waterfall". This approach was about creating requirements and models for the future product first, and after details were all figured out, moving on to implementation. This didn't work very well because business constraints would often times be misunderstood by the planners, the requirements changed etc. So, the next approach, the one often used today is "agile". The main idea is to involve customers as early in development process as possible and to work in short iterations, in small loosely joined teams. The problems with this approach are that projects' code becomes legacy code even before the program is shipped to the customer, it is much easier to run the project into a disaster because iterative development often times fails to see the larger picture. On top of it, this project management approach created a lot of charlatans and witchcraft. People who almost literally worship the very superficial practices of this approach (e.g. daily stand-up meetings), while ignoring the more real and hard-to-solve problems. I've seen people throwing beach ball to each other at daily meetings in order to pass the turn to speak. I've seen people doing daily stand-ups standing on one foot, all gathered in a circle. I've seen a special cards deck for scrums, and a lot more things that are, frankly, should be degrading to anyone with an engineering degree... ---- There are also some books about how to develop software. Most of them would claim that they are agnostic to the language and the purpose of the program, but that would be usually a lie. Just do a web search for something like "enterprise architecture" to get a feel of what's out there. Also, if you insist on reading them, you will find that arguments found in those books are way less persuasive than arguments that you'd expect from a typical CS book. Basically, authors will argue from their own experience, at best, if they have any, in many cases those would be just some pipe-smoking dreams. Bottom line... it works, somehow. People who work on projects where the selling point is the quality of software rather than the usefulness of the product to a wide audience tend to be better programmers and better organized, but that's just a statistical guess. Try finding such open-source project and join it, and just see where the life takes you. That would be the way to go to actually learn what it's like to make software.
Pycharm, haven't needed to use anything else since I installed it 
OP here! I forgot to mention : this is my first time posting here, and I would love to hear some feedback!
Pycharm. It's heavy, but complete.
This is clearly just an opinion, though you seem to present it as otherwise. The link you posted is also just an opinion and yours isn't really strengthened by pointing out that there is someone out there that agrees with you. There are obviously people who agree with you. Including others in this thread. &gt; 2k lines is definitely at the point where you need to split the file up. Splitting it would increase readability and reduce complexity. This is a ridiculous claim to make in general. It depends on the code in question. Some code makes no sense and is only 100 lines long. Some code is clear and makes sense at 10,000. There isn't some magical clarity gained by splitting files. The clarity is gained by splitting files cleanly in a logical fashion. The lines of code metric is a lazy crutch and while it provides code smell ("whoa this is long what's going on here?"), it is not a silver bullet ("oh I see this makes sense its structure is clear"). By the way, here is the first line from your link: &gt; As an ideal model I use the following criteria (with a similar rationale to what Martin Beckett suggested, i.e. to think in terms of logical structure and not in terms of lines of code) I.e. "not in terms of lines of code". And in your quote, he used the word "probably". Honestly that link neither states that 2000 is a hard limit nor does it disagree with me. Finally to swing around to this, your idea here is just bizarre: &gt; As a general rule of thumb if it takes me more than 10 seconds to scroll through the file then it is too long. Are you telling me you can scroll through two files of 1000 lines faster than one file of 2000?
It's a trap, don't forget to let you nephew use the pi sometimes after you :D
Yep, used to see this at my last job as well. Most of the 'dev' guys would use something like Atom or VS Code for developing code; just one guy who wanted to look cool, so he had a terminal-only system, and wrote code on Emacs! I personally prefer vim on a modern DE on Linux!
I like visual studio code personally, just because I prefer Microsofts autocomplete. Its also super light weight.
you drunk?
Hi everyone! I am the author of this post. Any kind of suggestions are more than welcome :) GitHub repo: [https://github.com/yasoob/FIFA-twilio-bot](https://github.com/yasoob/FIFA-twilio-bot) 
VSCode isnt an ide. VS 2017 is though.
Nice job. I am starting with Python. Please give a brief description on how you created the simulator
Can you explain to me what a Raspberry Pi does/is? I never ever understand what I could do with one if I had it. It feels like something I'd like, but... for what?
Look, I can rewrite this long article in just few sentences: &gt; What is MemCached? It's like Redis, but obsolete. &gt; How to use MemCached? Don't, use Redis instead. That was easy.
Mosquito bites are the worst.
Seems interesting enough. I'm gonna try it, thanks!
Heavy in space or ram ? 
I'm gonna downvote all your shitty comments
I would used a word embedding model with a LTSM model. This is pretty easy to implement in TFLearn which is a wrapper around tensorflow. These models tend to be pretty accurate. Though this would mean abandoning your pre-trained word embeddings. 
Thanks - I'll let him get settled with this, then we can look at options ☺️
Emacs with Elpy

I'm not going to do it justice - it's a great value, accessible, phenomenally well supported computer designed to get children interested in computers. However it is SO much more... I wonder what the ratio of children to adult owners is worldwide?! 😁🤘

Well mostly it was using the [Euler Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method) to solve Newton's Gravity equation for each and every step an orbiter moves. Used numpy for dealing with all the x,y,v\_x,v\_y values and matplotlib for plotting the final graph. Euler's method is basically a way of solving a differential equation numerically, and you can even do it by hand. But writing a program drastically decreases the number of steps required (and you get to do fun stuff with it too)
**Euler method** In mathematics and computational science, the Euler method (also called forward Euler method) is a first-order numerical procedure for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with a given initial value. It is the most basic explicit method for numerical integration of ordinary differential equations and is the simplest Runge–Kutta method. The Euler method is named after Leonhard Euler, who treated it in his book Institutionum calculi integralis (published 1768–1870). The Euler method is a first-order method, which means that the local error (error per step) is proportional to the square of the step size, and the global error (error at a given time) is proportional to the step size. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
...ha! I've had a 2b for 3 years, though as a server not for fun :)
Not usually my thing, are you offering to buy next time your in seattle?
Nicely done! Your structure with using a numpy array for the `derive` function means it’ll be much simpler to move to the Runge–Kutta method when you’re ready. (I wish I could convey this to my students, a lot of whom tend to insist on explicitly calculating positions and velocities separately!) If Runge–Kutta is too hard, how about the midpoint method? Use Euler to find the midpoint (I.e. use half a time step), then use the result of `derive` at that point to project across the whole interval (not starting from the midpoint—that would just be Euler with funky step sizes). Only save the result of the latter in your list (otherwise you’ll get a zigzag) Euler is especially bad for orbit simulations because it doesn’t conserve kinetic energy. Midpoint and Runge–Kutta do, so you’ll see a dramatic improvement in your orbits just from the midpoint. Once you’ve worked out using one intermediary point to tune the accuracy, hopefully the full Runge–Kutta method won’t be so daunting :)
seems nice but pity only 3.6 +

Typically you'd have the first proxy perform authentication. Then inject HTTP headers to forward user and group information upstream for the next proxy to use for authorization.

Please not this again. VS Code is an IDE, when you install the extensions to make it an IDE. This approach is used because VS Code is mostly language-agnostics.
Some editors supports extensions, which can integrate various functionality used for programming development. That will make them an IDE, since the editor is also an integrated development environment.
is it available for sublime text? if so tell me the package, i'm interested !
Super well-deserved! The Jupyter Notebook is a fantastic thing.
Hey! You got served a [Duff Beer](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouGotServed/comments/1amlq1/get_served_simpsons_style_duff_energy_drink_225/). Doh!. 
Ha ha ha so funny ha
I just managed to completely understand how the Euler method worked, and really didn't want to get into any other methods without completely understanding what I'm doing. But I'll definitely try out the midpoint method (probably as a different function) and compare the results. I'm excited to see what happens :) &gt; Euler is especially bad for orbit simulations because it doesn’t conserve kinetic energy. I... did not know this. Thank you so much for your feedback!
Sure send me the document and I can ask clarifications and give you a price quote.
What's wrong with pipenv?
Between vim, a fuckton of plugins, and some miscellaneous tools, I have yet to find a benefit to using an IDE except for forcing me to use a mouse.
Regular old virtualenv?
Pipenv is the next generation virtual environment manager! The alternative is legacy.
There's Python scripting as add-on on Asset store.
good job
I use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) with [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv) plugin, to manage both Python versions and virtualenvs.
The authorisation would only be used on the tunnel. Since I need a way for other IPs to use my other proxies, that are binded by IP, so I'm going to bind the IP or my server then redirect through that. How would I perform authentication, like how would I grab the user and pass on authentication?
Here's to new beginnings :)
Isnt IDLE the most up to date editor for python as it comes with the latest version
Post your code. Also, /r/learnpython.
stock VScode is a text editor same with atom and sublimetext3 
Thanks rzzzwilson. The interpretation aspect you mentioned helps a lot and I will post in learnpython as well, which I didn't know existed. Greatly appreciate the response!
Not possible. Use [psutil](https://pypi.org/project/psutil/) instead.
You can't write `return` outside a function. Also, once again, /r/learnpython.
but their is no function.
Exactly. You can only have `return` in a function. You have no function, so you can't use `return`.
thanks 
You might like to use raw strings for your Windows path names.

Yeah you're so right, I definitely did not understand the point of this PEP.
Yeah I completely overcomplicated what this PEP was suggesting. Cheers for the explanation.

To shed more light on why this happens, and why your confusion is justified: Python's designers weren't particularly skilled or even familiar with theoretical basis of languages and, in particular, different ways to approach programming language semantics. By and large, they simply copied some programming practices from Basic, other practices from SETL, something else was inspired by C etc. None of the aforementioned languages was a particularly good example of coherent and consistent treatment of language semantics either. This is why Python has `return` keyword. To better understand this confusion, you need to know some history and some background in language semantics. For the purpose of this question, it is enough to know that there is a way to interpret program code as saying "what computer should do" (this is further referred to as "imperative"), one more way to interpret program code is as saying "results of code evaluation are obtained by application of certain grammatical rules" (this is further referred to as "declarative"). Generally speaking, people understand imperative programs as sequence of steps, which are so arranged that after executing the program for a while, the result appears in a specific place, but it is rather a side effect of the program, because it is not captured by the program, only the means of obtaining it are. If we look at the program from declarative point of view, then the result of the program is some (arbitrary) chosen stage in the sequence of applying grammatical rules. Typically, we are interested in stages, where the result can be represented most compactly, or in stages where we cannot find any more applicable rules. In any case, imperative languages need some way of telling us that "this is the place where we store the result". This is particularly necessary when such languages use procedures, and we need to pass "the result" as an argument to another procedure. Declarative languages, on the other hand, don't have a concept of returning results. Python is mostly imperative language, which is something it inherited from Basic and C. Which are both mostly imperative. But, in order to appeal to the early user of these languages who were mostly comfortable with declarative (mathematical) approach to program interpretation both these languages wanted to enable their user to write expressions of sort `x = f(y)`. And this is how `return` keyword was invented. Notice, that Basic used a somewhat saner approach, where you'd write something like: procedure x = f(y) x = y * y endprocedure But, Python chose to follow C example here. Now, this looks like as if it was almost the familiar mathematical way of writing things... but it comes with a lot of complications, such as distinction between expressions and statements, contextually defined keywords, etc.: on one hand Python allows some degree of declarative semantics, but in some other cases it uses imperative semantics, and the particularly annoying thing about it is that there is no rime nor reason for the choice in any particular situation. It is all a historical artifact which you simply need to memorize.
Exactly, once you get to the keyboard-only workflow of vim, the rest of the IDEs feel counter-intuitive!

Thanks for pointing that out—I’ve removed the implications that it does. 
Just FYI, I am totally stealing this reply (and I'll give credit) when I see this question posted again in a few days.
So, a link shortener?
Just promise you'll add to it as these topics show up ;)
This is much better suited for /r/learnpython. Also, there are very, very, very, very few instances where, outside of creating a python package, should you ever use from module import *
Thank you, i also posted on /r/learnpython
Duh, you don't want to conserve *kinetic* energy, you want to conserve *total* energy (kinetic + potential). And numerical integration won't, in general. A symplectic method, however, will conserve a quantity that *approximates* the total energy (hopefully rather well, outside of singular points like particle collisions). The simplest integrator with this property is the [leapfrog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leapfrog_integration).
Thanks for this... it seems to be a pretty feature-complete project so the long time since last release shouldn't be a problem. I'll definitely give it a spin!
1. Why not use numpy? 2. Your mean and std implementations could be more numerically stable: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance
**Algorithms for calculating variance** Algorithms for calculating variance play a major role in computational statistics. A key difficulty in the design of good algorithms for this problem is that formulas for the variance may involve sums of squares, which can lead to numerical instability as well as to arithmetic overflow when dealing with large values. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
I'm going to be honest with you, and I'm going to say I have no idea what you were saying.
You can read \`.docx\` files with \`textract\` - [http://textract.readthedocs.io/en/stable/](http://textract.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and you can create wordpress posts and upload images with \` python-wordpress-xmlrpc\` - [http://python-wordpress-xmlrpc.readthedocs.io](http://python-wordpress-xmlrpc.readthedocs.io)
I can try to get some pictures when I get home tonight. My pulley is a 4 inch diameter pulley. So circumference is about 12.5 inches. 10 turns of the pulley would be 125 inches or slightly over 10 feet. My door only opens to about 78 inches (6.5 feet) or about 6.2 turns. So I adjusted my operating range to be in the middle of the pot.
Does it work on Windows? Also any chance of changing the license to a BSD-3 or MIT license instead of GPL 2?
Looks good, although you should remove the claim that these functions don't exist in python's `math` module because most of them do. You've made good efforts to do error handling but the manual checks and errors you're throwing don't add anything beyond what the standard library does. If anything, you're being needlessly restrictive. If someone passes a non-number into something which needs a number, an error will be thrown anyway. There are a couple of lines of pretty dense maths which aren't the most readable - of course, maths usually isn't, but where you can split thinks over a few lines it might aid comprehension. `snake_case` for functions, not `camelCase`.
I'll look into the stability thing, but the main point of this was to try and teach myself how these things work, and I was kinda inspired by the lack of an nth root function in the math.py library, it isn't really meant for actual use, as there is a lot of inconsistencies. Thanks for the feedback!
sounds dope
Even an RK4 won't give you great orbits for a low number of steps. There are orbit specific methods of integration that have side effects (the orbit preceses), but are quite good.
This does sound really exciting! Also, if anyone in here is a student, you can get a free 1yr License
Thanks for the feedback! I didn't mean for what I said about math.py to be taken as ALL of the functions not existing, but the I was inspired to do this by a lack of an nth root function in the math library, so the point was to say that a FEW of them didn't exist in their library.
Nothing come close to [conda](https://github.com/conda/conda) IMO. Quite possibly the best package and venv manager I've used in any language.

Never use t-SNE for clustering, just as a tool for visual inspection of your data. See \[here\]([https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/264647](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/264647)) for reasoning.
It depends on how the console renders the special characters. AFAIK, the char width on windows cmd is not as good as Linux, making the output weirld. However, some terminal simulators should do well. Per license, it is inherited from the node.js project, so I am afraid not.
Python 2.7 is on the way!
This is my first English article. Thank you for reading.
PySide is an alternative binding to Qt. Very similar to PyQt. The difference is that PySide is under a more permissive license and is now an official Qt project, versus PyQt which is owned by a third party.
Taking notes throughout is a good practice.
Pew? 
Thanks for sharing this. In the past, I've colorized Windows command line and Linux shells with [colorama](https://github.com/tartley/colorama).
Something that never ceases to amaze me is just how usefull logging is. Put it where tou think you need it, then add to it as you debug, and leave it there (yay logging levels!)
Please at least *try* to start a discussion. What is this? Who should use it? Why should we use it rather than alternatives?
I would argue it is better to follow the PEP 8 standards be having methods/functions/variables as lowercase with underscores separating the words, i.e. useable\_as\_weapon. Only classes should have upper/camel case (as far as I'm aware anyway).
If you edit your post and [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) then maybe we could understand what your problem is. What do you mean by "interpret the user input for the 'y' variable reference the variable 'd' with the value of 2.4."? Could you give us an example of what a user might enter at the "y" prompt and explain what you want to do with the input string?
https://poetry.eustace.io/
You are measuring euclidean distance across a set of values that may (or may not) be terribly related, or even on the same scale. Given that it might be useful to standardise your data first before clustering (or doign dimension reduction (the StandardScaler or RobustScaler in sklearn will do the job). I suspect, in practice, you have some extreme values which have pulled the K-Means centroids away, and which t-SNE doesn't "see" (since it considers k-neighbor graphs essentially). Scaling the features will be a good start; you may also want to look at a more interepretable dimension reduction like PCA as well as t-SNE to help get an idea of any extremal data. Finally if there are extremal points messing with things you may want to consider a more noise tolerant clustering algorithm like DBSCAN or HDBSCAN.
A few ways you could do this, you could store your variables in a dictionary and use the keys as your reference, which is probably the easiest. You could use vars()\[variable name\] to search for the variable that has that name. You could also use the eval function (not recommended) to provide a work around.
Yes, deleted, sorry, thanks for the feedback! 
« I’m fine » says the guy freaking out over a reddit comment. XD
note: for newbies, and the rest of us, you should probably show the import statement so it's obvious where you're pulling it in.
When you say more numerically stable what do you mean?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkMWsO_-X7Y I'm not freaking out over a reddit comment my dude LOL. Just pointing out how you seem like a miserable, angry person. Take a look at your karma on this post and you'll realize that everyone else agrees. Take the L and deactivate bud, you're just embarrassing yourself at this point.
a bot is useless if it requires everyone to have a local file.

Makes sense, thanks.
So unoriginal. Get a new schtick. 
How about Microsoft SQL server?
Looks like a good project to see how stuff works. Your `comp` function does some double calculating since you do the whole factorial on top and the bottom will cancel the smaller part of the numerator's factorial. In addition since you have ln and exp you pretty easily define a pow function for non-integer powers and use that to find your roots instead of calling python's native pow. x^n = exp(n*ln(x))
Cited in his code, just added to readme as well. 
I think that type annotations are very useful if you want the code to be more user friendly. For example, if you know exactly what each argument should be and you are the only one using it, type hints are unnecessary, but if you expect that others will be using your project/whatever, type hints provide a nice backbone for the user. Maybe I have no clue what I'm talking about but that's my opinion on them.
They're great for improving code readability and module usability. The code can alert you of unexpected argument types. Make sure you take advantage of NewTypes, great for when many functions are designed to be used with multiple types.
My bad i hadnt seen it discussed before 
Thanks! I will definitely look into that power thing!
1. The article really did explain to me the finer points of asyncio I needed to "get it". 2. The second example should have a `asyncio.wait` call. Leaving it as is implies that `Task.result()` blocks and waits for the task to finish, which it does not.
Oh nice, [`NewType()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#newtype) looks super cool! 
Hello once again! I was trying to make some C code run with ShivyC + pycca + PyVM today, but quickly realized that ShivyC only generates 64-bit assembly, which I can even compile to binary, but then PyVM fails spectacularly because it doesn’t support 64-bit binaries yet( I was wondering whether there’s an option to make ShivyC output _32-bit assembly only_. I did read through your code, but couldn’t find anything that could do that easily, like with a switch or something. Maybe you could suggest something to do that? Thanks.
&gt; if you know exactly what each argument should be and you are the only one using it, type hints are unnecessary I dunno, I think you're assuming my memory is better than it really is. :)
You can actually show this pretty easily given the information you have. If you save the coordinates (x,y) and the velocities (vx, vy), you can calculate the energies at all your timesteps. You can even calculate these quantities after running the simulation. Then you can make plots of, for instance, PE vs t, KE vs T, and total energy vs t.
Yup, yup
Numeric stability means that the intermediate values don't stray too far from the eventual solution. Let's say we have a vector `x = [x1, x2, ..., xN]`. The naive way to get the mean is to sum up the xs then divide by N: mean = (x1 + x2 + ... + xN) / N The problem here is that the value of the sum can be MUCH bigger than the mean. A lot of the time, this means you could suffer from rounding error. In the worst case, the sum could even overflow. Distributing the `1/N` could help: mean = x1/N + x2/N + ... + xN/N But even in this case, individual values could underflow. You probably want to use Welford's method (called the "online method" in that Wikipedia page) which allows you to compute the mean and sum of squares at the same time in a more stable way.
XD actually too relatable. but basically they're just useful in general then.
1. Glad to hear. 2. Updated, thanks. I wanted to avoid introducing yet another api, but I guess its better than creating a misconception.
Ok Thank You!
Don’t find these articles making much sense anymore- most factors listed could be said of R as well. It’s in fact good that we all don’t have only one language to fall back on.
Discoveries from my asyncio fights: - if you do subprocess, either wait for the coroutine that reads stdout/stdetr to end OR use process.wait(). Do not do both - you get a weird rare pause reading/deallocate/resume race condition - Between process.returncode and process.terminate the process can really die, throwing an exception on process.terminate. 
If your programming needs a little help my company does a lot of python data scrubbing, my gong and ETL work. We are licensed, bonded and insured here in Seattle but we do probably 60% of our work is with remote clients.
Next article is on Oracle and Microsoft.... 
You can show him how the risc assembly instructions (arm) are more easy to read than the cisc ones(x86) 
That does seem pretty interesting. And easy. More importantly, it looks like it can be implemented in like 5 minutes (because I just have a huge numpy table with x, y, vx and vy values)
&gt;The code can alert you of unexpected argument types. you mean the linter like mypy right? Not the code you are writing. I was under the impression type annotations dont do anything at runtime.
Indeed :). Summary statistics like total energy, entropy in a system, ratios of values to timesteps, are all very useful when thinking about simulations. Hopefully you find it interesting and keep pursuing this! Good luck!
One pattern I often end up running into with asyncio code is needing to duplicate interface entry points to support async and non-async code: class Example: def do_things(): return asyncio.run_until_complete(self.async_do_things()) async def async_do_things(): return await some_async_process() Is there a clean way to avoid this?
I think most IDEs will also alert you
So you're hearing this sentiment a lot?
I think this tutorial can be improved very much. Here is my analysis and suggestions: &gt; **Write a Slack bot that handles Excel files (xlsx)** &gt; &gt; So, as the title says, I will teach you to build a simple Slack bot that will use an Excel sheet as it's database in the back. Well, that's actually *not* what the title says, the title is misleading (that's actually why I followed the link in the first place). I was under the impression that the bot handles Excel files as input and processes them for whatever reason, at least that's my understanding of the verb "to handle sth.". But I guess in the end it doesn't really matter because it's "just" about using a library for working with Excel files. More important is the lack of a description of what the bot is actually supposed to do. Throughout the whole tutorial I was confused and couldn't really figure out the intention of the code. &gt; **set up** &gt; &gt; First things first, if you have been reading my tutorials you know what this is. Yes, we first create a virtual environment. &gt; &gt; $ virtualenv venv -p python3.6 &gt; $ source venv/bin/activate &gt; (venv) $ [Starting with Python 3.3 virtual env support is built-in.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) &gt; **Writing the bot** &gt; &gt; This time I am not gonna write it all down in one single file. So that it's easier to maintain. I feel like the author should also describe the structure of your code at this point which I think has a few flaws which I'll discuss later. First I'll get into each file individually. &gt; Let's first write the module to handle the Excel sheet &gt; &gt; Filename: `xlsx_utilities.py` &gt; &gt; from random import randint &gt; import xlrd &gt; &gt; class XlsxUtilities: &gt; def __init__(self, workbook_file_path, sheet_name): &gt; self.workbook = xlrd.open_workbook(workbook_file_path, on_demand=True) &gt; self.sheet = self.workbook.sheet_by_name(sheet_name) &gt; self.total_columns = len(self.sheet.col_values(1)) # including title row &gt; &gt; def random_quotes(self): &gt; # excluding the title row &gt; random_row = randint(1, self.total_columns) &gt; return self.sheet.row_values(random_row) &gt; &gt; We are reading our Excel file (a.k.a. workbook) and it's Sheet. We are then calculating the number of all the rows present, this is the number of all the quotes. Next, we select a number randomly between 1 and the length we got earlier. We take that row and return it. Multiple problems here: - When the author describes the format of the Excel file they forgot to mention that the sheet needs to have a name. - They're speaking of "the number of all the rows present" yet the variable name is `total_columns`. - `random_quotes` is not a good method name because it only returns *one* quote and it's inconsistent with the rest of the naming because it doesn't contain a verb: "random quotes what?". - Commenting style is also inconsistent, above and behind the line. Maybe [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/?#comments) can help. &gt; Next, we will write the file to initiate the bot and listen to messages. &gt; &gt; Filename: `bot.py` &gt; &gt; import time &gt; from slackclient import SlackClient &gt; &gt; import event &gt; &gt; class Bot(object): &gt; &gt; def __init__(self): &gt; self.slack_client = SlackClient("YOUR_SLACK_API_KEY_HERE") &gt; self.bot_name = "quoter" # NAME OF YOUR BOT HERE &gt; self.bot_id = self.get_bot_id() &gt; &gt; if self.bot_id is None: &gt; print("Error, could not fine " + self.bot_name) &gt; &gt; self.event = event.Event(self) &gt; self.listen() &gt; &gt; def get_bot_id(self): &gt; api_call = self.slack_client.api_call("users.list") &gt; if api_call.get("ok"): &gt; # retrieving all users so that we can find out bot &gt; users = api_call.get("members") &gt; for user in users: &gt; if "name" in user and user.get("name") == self.bot_name: &gt; return "&lt;@" + user.get("id") + "&gt;" &gt; return None &gt; &gt; def listen(self): &gt; if self.slack_client.rtm_connect(with_team_state=False): &gt; print("Successfully connected, listening for commands") &gt; while True: &gt; # to keep it running always &gt; self.event.wait_for_event() &gt; time.sleep(1) &gt; else: &gt; print("Error, Connection failed!") &gt; &gt; Here we're initiating the bot with our API key. Then we get out bot's id, this helps us make sure that our bot got mentioned. Then in the listen function, we are listening to all the events happening in the channel, and for everything that happens we are passing it on to the even.waiting_for_event function. And, now it's time to finally handle these events. Again, multiple problems here: - Like in the `XlsxUtilities` class earlier the variable parts of a class should be passed to its constructor. But instead they're asking to hardcode the API key and the bot's name. - The method `get_bot_id` seems to have a bad name too because it doesn't describe what they say the method is supposed to do: "helps us make sure that our bot got mentioned", by the way, what does *that* mean? - There's no need to inherit from `object`. &gt; Filename: `events.py` &gt; &gt; import sys &gt; &gt; import xlsx_utilities &gt; &gt; class Event: &gt; def __init__(self, bot): &gt; self.bot = bot &gt; self.xlsx = xlsx_utilities.XlsxUtilities(workbook_file_path="Quotes.xlsx", sheet_name="Quotes") &gt; &gt; def wait_for_event(self): &gt; events = self.bot.slack_client.rtm_read() &gt; if events: &gt; for event in events: &gt; # print(evnet) &gt; self.parse_event(event) &gt; &gt; def parse_event(self, event): &gt; # if our bot get's mentioned, in a text message &gt; if event and "text" in event and self.bot.bot_id in event["text"]: &gt; try: &gt; response = self.xlsx.random_quotes() &gt; response = """{} — {}""".format(response[0], response[1]) &gt; channel = event["channel"] &gt; self.send_message(channel, response) &gt; except: &gt; print("Unexpected error:", sys.exc_info()[0]) &gt; raise &gt; &gt; def send_message(self, channel, response): &gt; self.bot.slack_client.api_call("chat.postMessage", channel=channel, text=response, as_user=True) &gt; &gt; First, in the constructor, we initialize out xlsx file. Then in parse_event, we check if out bot got mentioned, then we get the random quote from the file. And using the helper function send_message send it to the channel where it was requested. - The Excel file and the sheet name is hardcoded. - The method `wait_for_event` doesn't have a great name either because it actually doesn't *wait* for an event, it tries to read and process them. - There's no need for `if events:`, `rtm_read` always returns a list. If it's empty the for loop's body won't be executed. - `parse_event` shouldn't call `send_message`, it's simply not it's job, at least according to its name. Now I'll address the structure of the whole code, especially the classes `Bot` and `Event`. The methods `wait_for_event` and `send_message` don't belong in `Event`. Why should an event wait for an event? And sending a message is the bot's job which you can actually see when you look in the method's body. The class `Bot` should be the central controlling component here which ties everything together. 
answered my own question.... `In [17]: def p(i:int): print(i)` `In [18]: p('not an int')` `not an int` `In [28]:` be careful or some haskell dude is going to come in here and school you on very boring mathematics etc...
yes, they use mypy or other linter in the background. that's not the same as runtime type checks. 
Linux commands usually only run on... Linux. It's a different operating system. However, there are 2 ways to do this. 1. Install cygwin - a linux "compatability layer" for windows 2. Install WIndows 10's "subsystem for linux" It might be quite complicated to call linux commands across the domain boundary though.
currently using them to help generate json serialization for models. kind of thinking there's other opportunities for some interesting meta programming type stuff. not so much worried about the linting aspects as of yet. 
Since a Raspberry Pi has a full OS stack, many people find them easier to use than something like an Arduino. In general they're used for either embedded applications (think homemade IoT) or for learning projects. For example, I have a (really crappy) cluster of a Pi 3 as the head node and 4 Pi Zeroes as the worker nodes.
If you look at the cfonts dependencies, cfonts actually uses both colorama and click underneath, and each provide colorized terminal output features. But I think one major difference is that it appears you can identify a font. In practice though, I am not sure what is really missing for me from colorama and click... this package for me seems like it's solving a problem I don't have. 
&gt; asyncio.run_until_complete Sync Code should have this at the top level and the rest should just be async. Essentially, All synchronous code should call async code but wait for it.

The first thing i ever built was a program that has a conversation with you. I didnt know much of the syntax at the time, the program just consisted of inputs and some other random stuff.
I implemented a parallel downloader of urls using asyncio, but it wasn't a very pleasant experience... lot of tutorials shows some simplified example, but when you want to make the correct, you are adding error handling here and there, and the resulting code is quite complex. So far, I had better experience with ThreadPoolExecutor from concurrent.futures.
...nice! Will be great to show him when he's more comfortable with things, thanks for sharing :)
Tried it. I think that the feature is not mature yet. It is too simplistic to capture what's actually going on in Python type system. It adds a lot of noise to the code, and I don't think that the amount of noise is justifiable. Most of my life I was writing in languages that had some, typically not very advanced (like in Java) type system. The limitations of these systems are very frustrating when you run into them. When things that should obviously work don't because of unnecessary type checking. So far, I decided for myself not to use type annotations. But time will show. I also worked with a language that at some point in its history gained type annotations and the entire programmers community switched to the "only with annotations" style of programming (ActionScript). Looking back at those days, it seems a very bizarre choice, but at the time it was somewhat justified by bad compilers... but not entirely. I hope Python will not make the same mistake.

Depends on what you really mean by "automatic" venv management... Maybe try any of these? * [python3 -m venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) * [virtualenvwrapper](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenvwrapper/) * [vex](https://pypi.org/project/vex/) * [pex](https://pypi.org/project/pex/) * [vsh](https://pypi.org/project/vsh/) 
thanks for telling !
&gt; because it could increase the performance of your program many many times. Specifically if your program is IO-bound, not CPU-bound, and it's handling very, very many connections. The article doesn't mention another strength of the asynchronous model: namely that it's synchronous (unless you're also using threads). Your coroutine is going to run until it yields control again, so you don't have to protect shared data with mutexes the way you do with threads. As a result, I find `asyncio` meshes quite nicely with the event loops of GUI libraries, where you traditionally have to keep IO off the main thread so the UI remains responsive. If you're writing a GUI app that basically just retrieves and shows data from the network, I strongly recommend looking into using `asyncio`. The app will likely be simpler to code and *more* responsive as a result. 
Instead of doing python 27, do python 3.4+ or something.
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
One year? I got one month only. how do I get that?
Not saying that this is not useful, but in general, using someone else's password manager requires a huge amount of trust if the code is not audited. It's just too easy to sneak in a few lines of code that e.g., send out your password via email. So, I would generally not recommend having a `exe` file in your repo, because this enforces bad practices for users
there is an option or link for students, you use your student email for your college

Love it with pycharm ide. It’s worth it even if you are a bit sloppy about Nones and annotate sparsely. 
This is a very beautiful explanation, I get it now, thank you. rant/ What I don't get, once again, is how absolutely dreadful people are at naming and reusing concepts. &gt;Calling a coroutine definition does not execute it. It initialises a coroutine object. If that's true, this: async def coroutine_1(): is not a function definition, it's a class definition and should have been defined something like class new_coroutine (asyncio.base_coroutine) : Is that as nice to read as the definition above? No. But it follows the established syntax rules of the language. &gt;Event loop runs tasks, not coroutine objects directly. Tasks are a wrapper around coroutine objects So it's literally like there is object with a "task/subroutine" method. Great. They just thought it would "help" if something that's very clearly *not* a function, looked like a function. If I needed more evidence that there is no god, this qualifies. /rant
r/ArcGIS (cross-posting)
this makes sense, I included it initially for my friends who were too lazy to install pycrypto alongside their python installs, but I will probably remove it since it looks sketchy

Can you read all the "candiate scores" in the source code of the page? (right click somewhere on the page -&gt; " **View page source"** or sth. like that) **If yes:** very simple approach: try the python library "scrapy" to get the page content and python regular expressions / string pattern matching to find your desired inforamtion. Search the source code for "candidate scores: " and retrieve the word/value after the colon (:). [https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html](https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html) **If no:** It gets a bit more complex. You have to consider how the data is retrieved / presented (e.g. a button to show more candidate scores,...). Maybe you have to simulate a "click" to load all data. For that, you need libraries like **selenium**. 
The answer is Yes . So I think your first advise will work. 
Sounds like you want the cumulative sum (`np.cumsum`) of your vectors.
1. /r/learnpython 2. I don't know what any of those parameters are and I'm pretty sure I don't need to see all of the logic, so all you've done by posting it is made it harder for people to help you. 3. Numpy arrays are indeed mutable, so you can change the object which is passed in and have those changes persisted outside the function.
I don't think so since that would just amass to one large line. I need them to just tack onto the end of the previous vector. The angles must also remain the same.
Why restrict the root function to only `int`-valued roots? Python's `pow` function will happily work with float and even complex arguments. Why round to six digits? You're just throwing away precision. If you do check types it's usually better to use `isinstance` rather than comparing against the result of `type`.
Ah, that sounds correct. I was unsure of the exact casing convention but if you adopt the PEP8 standard it would definitely help since you are likely going to be collaborating with many others.
gotcha thanks for pointing that out! happy to see rocket on there as inspiration as well! I don't have much to say about ApiStar components but i was kind of of put by the sudden 0.4 transition and removal of multiple integrated features without viable replacements (and like all the docs). how does performance compare? As someone who hasn't read the actual source for either project, it seemed like apistar was doing something significantly different which allowed it to be drastically faster than other frameworks by using its static knowledge of what a given route required from a request. Do you know if I'm correct, slash if the same kinds of benefits apply to molton?
Off to a bad start. Concurrency is a feature of an algorithm, nothing to do with the threads or platforms involved. A concurrent algorithm can be parallelised. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN_DpYBzKso
the sanest post in this thread. 
I understand how scrapy works, Just installed it in my Fedora workstation. But the problem is the URL that I wish to crawl in complex one. Not like the tutorial. My URL is something like this : https://www.abc.de/en/example-nextexample-countryname/services/tothe-myfault/keyword-entry/noow-candidate/rounds-whatisthat.html
Are you talking about in Sanic? The point of the async would be to allow your workers, for example, to handle more requests. While one request is off fetching data from a DB, another can come in and start the process.
What is that list comprehension supposed to mean? That's rather list uncomprehension.
I understand your point, but it is not correct. While yes, the request headers and cookies (for example) are already available and no async is required there, what may not be available (for example) would be a refresh token that is held in storage some where. That would be async. There is a very calculated effort to go thru the entire chain to determine which calls do and do not potentially need async. Because the package was setup to allow the developer to plugin to it, and because many of those endpoints that the developer will be adding would likely use something like `aiopg` or `aredis`, this package from those entry points, also needs to support async/await.

What have you accomplished since you started programming? Any thing you do should be considered a project and added to your portfolio of accomplishments. This is your experience! Whether it's at work, in a lab, or on your phone. If you created it, it's something you experienced doing and it counts for a job. You have a lot of different technologies you have touched in that year. How many of them do you know really well? How many do you kinda know? How many are you familiar with? I find it difficult to believe, not impossible, that you know any of those languages on an expert or proficient level. You should think of your skill set like a T, broad general knowledge and deep expert level knowledge on one or two subjects. I recommend picking a couple that you enjoyed working with and do a couple of projects with them to showcase what you are capable of. Start networking in those technologies, meetup.com is a good place to start. The jobs will follow. Disclaimer: I'm not a programmer, systems operations and engineer for 10 years, but this is what I have seen in the technology space as a whole. Any programmers have other thoughts.
moot point no? jwt is meant to be stateless, there should be no token anywhere you need to get from anywhere BUT the header.

Many of the tools you listed are good to have experience with, but without something to show for yourself you don't stand out. it's like you said -- your GitHub page doesn't have much to show for it. Create something you are proud of and pin it to your profile. It doesn't have to do anything spectacular or even original. You want to be able to show that you can take something from idea to workable state. Along the way you want to show that you have good habits (documentation, unit tests, etc.). If the things on your GH page already show these things, then you might not be selling yourself correctly on your resume and cover letter. Talk less about your experience with these various modules and more about what you did with them: your apps, your visualizations, etc. Alternatively (or in addition, if you have the time) contribute to projects you are familiar with and pin that as well. The [matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues) issues page has a thousand outstanding issues. The [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues) page has 2.5k. There is work to be done out there that you can put your name and be proud of! 
I don't want to shit on your work, but I would feel remiss if I didn't point out that people should only use a password manager that has been vetted by professional security people...
Rejection is pretty normal. Experienced candidates can be rejected for any number of reasons. Just don't give up. It's good that you're checking out different tools. As I don't know what's exactly on your resume, I can only offer some general tips. Do not lie about your experience. Practice responses to common interview questions. Get familiar with coding topics like algorithms, design patterns, language fundamentals, etc. I hope this helps.
Thats honestly not something I ever considered when making this, but which makes perfect sense! I guess I will keep adding to this just because I actually use it. My prior solution to managing accounts was a .rar file with a password lol
Using divided factorials for your combinatorial functions will limit the size of things you can easily compute by a lot - the intermediate values get huge.
I use them. Not because they are a great implementation of a type system, but they are a workable solution for type hints in my IDE of choice (PyCharm). I hated the visual noise at at first, but after a week I don't even notice them. Particularly when I started doing things like pulling a parameters type hint out into a reusable variable named descriptively.
Thanks for your response. I changed the code to be more basic.
&gt; It adds a lot of noise to the code This is so true. Annotated code is harder to read. It damages the readability that makes Python awesome. Readability is priceless. But I understand that annotations help to catch a whole class of bugs that sometimes fall onto the final users. But I'm still not using annotations. 
Are you looking for a code review?
cute idea! that's a lot of ifs and elifs though 
If you wish to give one. The code itself was just made for fun.
Oh, ok. My only suggestion was that you have a ton of if statements that all seem to do the same thing - comparing moves. I'd see if you could wrap that logic into a single function that, when given two moves, returns the winner.
Going further : implicit Euler act like a dumper when explicit Euler do the inverse. This result can be generalized : implicit method inject numerical diffusion and reduce total energy. (well, it slightly more complexe than that, but good starting point.) On conterpart, that numerical diffusion stabilize the results. When you are using implicit or explicit Euler, you have to trade stability over accuracy (not talking about the difficulty to write implicit scheme). With less naive scheme as Runge kutta (among others), you can avoid most of bad counterpart of these schemes. Yet, if you are not writing your scheme as conservative, you will not conserve (as the scheme name inform you) the energy : you can write the analytic system energy and see that it increase or decrease each steps. Even very complex scheme cannot change that, only contain it around the machine accuracy (pm me if you want more detailed demonstration) 
kinda wanna do this in Java..could it be done with switches?
I nearly got a Rapsberry Pi for my nephew's 12th birthday two weeks ago. You've encouraged me that he should get one for Christmas. :)
Can we make an edgelist mapping the relationships between objects?
Probably yeah.
Ok.Lets make it simple. Suppose I copy and saved the html content from that page. Now I just want to crawl that html file from my local directory and pull some specific lines ? What's the process for that ? 
If you think about the call as initialising the async function's state it does feel a bit like class initialisation. However it's conceptually still a function, so using function syntax makes sense, and the behaviour is consistent with generators (functions with `yield` instead of `return`). In fact they are closely related to one another, so it is not the case that there has been a failure of concept reuse.
Newbie question: Why not use threads?
This makes me sad. The Python community seems incapable to work together on the a single tool for the benft of all, it's fragmentation upon fragmentation :(
Coroutines are still running in the same thread/process, which avoids expensive locks and context switches.
The process is to read a fucking document. Don't ask people to have brains for you.
I've never felt like i qualified for a job that I was hired for based on the requirements in the posting. And most people I've worked alongside don't have all the requirements covered for the jobs they hold. No matter how much you know, you're going to have a job that has things you've never touched that you've got to learn, you can't know everything about everything, ever. So don't freak out too much on that. &gt;What do I need to know in order to get at least a jr python job? Someone who works at the company who will vouch for you is _incredibly_ helpful. The first job you get will be the most difficult. Everything after that is likely to be referrals from someone you worked with who says "hey, go hire this person, they're good." Suddenly the interview process is much less antagonistic. Stay determined, don't lose hope.
Sorry about that. I admit my mistake but dont use the f word my friend. It shows your class as a human being.
Not class in the programming sense, of course, since you can't understand normal thinking.
"My friend" "My friend" "My friend"
That is some good looking AI. 
I suggest you untie the game logic from IO. First, decide who wins, second, print it out. Even if you still have copypasta, this way there will be less of it.
You are doing AES wrong, your passwords should not be bound only to one device
should I have a random IV everytime an account is encrypted?
I'd use a dictionary. Something like this: # Dict with what moves lose to key move moves = {"Rock": ["paper", "spock"], "Paper": ["scissors", "lizard"]}... etc if player in moves[computer]: tie() elif moves[computer] == player: lose() else: win()

[http://www.sparkmeter.io/en/jobs/systems-engineer/](http://www.sparkmeter.io/en/jobs/systems-engineer/) Location: Washington, DC Requirements &amp; Skills You will be a good fit for this role if you have: * **Several years of software engineering experience.** Much of our codebase is written in Python and familiarity with the language is key, even if you are not an expert. You should be familiar with key aspects of computer science such as data structures, algorithms, and distributed systems. * **Linux and POSIX systems experience.** Our systems are built on Linux, and familiarity with the OS in general and suite of tools is critical to your success in this role. You should be very comfortable working from a terminal. * **Experience with key development tools and practices:** Git, unit testing, continuous integration, automatic deployment, release cycles must be familiar tools and practices to you. * **Experience with AWS or another cloud provider.** You’ll work every day with the AWS Console or CLI, and existing AWS experience will be an asset for you. However, significant work experience with another provider -- Google, Azure, and so on -- can be a good substitute. * **Strong communication and teaching skills.** You will need to be able to convey your ideas and explain your solutions to others. You should feel comfortable explaining complex technical solutions to an audience that is not familiar with them. * **Strong problem solving skills.** We are looking for a problem solver. Writing code should be a very powerful tool at your disposal, but not all solutions are written in code. Sometimes the right solution might be in the process, documentation, or communication. You should always be striving towards simplification. Simpler systems are easier to understand, debug, and maintain. * **Natural curiosity.** We are looking for someone who is naturally curious with a hacker mindset. Debugging isn't a chore, it’s a personal challenge. You can look at a log file and say that something is off and figure out why. * **Comfort with imperfection.** It’s important to be able to admit mistakes, find fixes, and learn from those experiences to not repeat them. * **Emotional intelligence.** You are open, honest, and dedicated to the growth, health, and well being of yourself and the people around you. You should be in charge of maintaining your own work/life balance and say something when you need help. If you see others struggling you should offer support. Sparkmeter is at its best when it’s people are at their best.
&gt;elif moves[computer] == player: This is comparing a list to a string, you probably meant something else.
Example of why python needs case statements
It has it though? Lol
Using ``random`` for secrets such as passwords is not best practice. Use the [``secrets`` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html#recipes-and-best-practices) instead.
No you have to use dictionaries to emulate it
SparkMeter is a Washington, DC based low-cost smart metering solutions provider targeting rural microgrids, currently installed in 22 countries. We are a python heavy group but also find ourselves adapting to the tool that works best for the job. You will design, build, and maintain the software and infrastructure that our utility customers around the world depend on to provide reliable power, and the tools that our colleagues need to sell, provision, and support installations of our smart metering systems. SparkMeter is currently hiring for several positions, but the one that might be a great fit for this group is the Systems/Software Engineer position. [http://www.sparkmeter.io/en/jobs/systems-engineer/](http://www.sparkmeter.io/en/jobs/systems-engineer/) We also have a short term contract role (3-6 months) working with our existing systems, and improving how we deploy, monitor, and maintain them.

[https://angel.co/sparkmeter-1/jobs/383104-junior-linux-systems-administrator](https://angel.co/sparkmeter-1/jobs/383104-junior-linux-systems-administrator) Both positions are on site and located in Washington, DC
This is bad practice I think, general rule is that you should NOT modify an object (say a list) that you are currently iterating over. Looks like you are comparing two lists (`x` and `y`) and creating a third column (`z`). I think you should be using `pandas` for this sort of work. There is a method `transform` that looks like it should do what you want. You can create an anonymous function inside transform with your logic. 
On top of what the others said -- while play == True Can actually just be replaced with while play: You have already defined it as true, therefore adding: == True Technically is not needed. Try this for proof: play = True while play: print("Hi") play=False You can technically leave out play=False, but it will cause your interpreter to just spam "Hi" over and over infinitely until you interrupt with CTRL+C.
First, I like the way that you added the verbs into the code. :) Nice project! I was just curious if there way a way to create something that would be expandable to the crazy games of Rock Paper Scissors. If you take a look at the charts for Rock Paper Scissors lizard Spock, there is a pattern that alternates from win to lose if you read the diagram in a counter clockwise direction. In theory, you should be able to have an array on any size (as long as it is in order) that you can compare for the game. You would just subtract the locations of the player and computer to find out who wins. (Please ignore unnecessary caps.) #player and computer are both strings from the Objects array #Example: if player chooses rock: # Tie, Win, Lose, Win, Lose, (would repeat if array is in order for game with more objects) Objects = [rock, lizard, spock, scissors, paper] # outcome is just the distance between the players and computers choice Outcome = Objects.index(player) - Objects.index(computer) If Outcome == 0: Print(‘tie’) Break # computers choice is an even number away from the player Elif Outcome % 2 = 0: Print(‘Computer wins!’) # The computer is an odd number away from the player, by process of elimination Else: Print(‘Player wins!’)
Should've been `elif player in moves[computer]`
I wish I saved the examples, but I once saw someone profile the same code as threads and again using asyncio. You say context switching is expensive, but do you want to guess which method came out on top? Of course, YMMV based on context of the code/application.
2.7+ and 3.4+ of course
What are beautiful coding style!!!
`asyncio.sleep()` will not necessarily return immediately when the timer expires. It just gets put back into the list of coroutines that can be run if the current coroutine yields. 
Also shared generators break things. I believe there are now async safe versions though 
LOL and you're asking for help to scrape scores for a shit CompTIA cert! WOW. Don't you think you should at least attempt to be non-autistic before posting here?
[removed]
By "help you" you mean do it for you because you are utterly incapable?
No, you're right, I would rather profile it and choose one. Still, that's one of the arguments for using co-routines rather than threads. Which is more expensive will be dependent on many things.
The application logic should be generated from a human-readable data file written by the (non-technical) game designer. Ergo, case statement not needed.
You can embed images in markdown on a gist.
Yep, and the first statement should be if computer == player:
If understand your requirements correctly, what you want is pos = [0,0] for i in M: plt.plot(pos, i) i = pos
Edit: last line is reversed, should be pos= i
His code calls `os.urandom`
Oh for sure, I wasnt implying coros/async are imperically slower, just that the situation matters and threads could be a better choice
&gt; I don't think so since that would just amass to one large line. I'm pretty sure that's what you're asking for. Say you have the vectors: (1, 1) (2, 2) (4, 4) You want your first vector to be a line from the origin `(0, 0)`: that is, a line going from `(0, 0)` to `(1, 1)`. &gt; using the end of the previous point as the new "origin" of the next point suggests to me that you want your next vector to start at `(1, 1)`, and project from there. So it'd be a line from `(1, 1)` to `(3, 3)`. Then your next vector would be a line from `(3, 3)` to `(7, 7)`. If this isn't what you want, I think you need to reword your question, possibly with an example of what you want the output to look like.
It's a fact that more code takes a longer time to read. If there's one file I have to scan through the entire thing. Which doesn't take too long if you are using regions / method jumping in a good IDE, but it can still be annoying. But if there's two files I select the one I want to view and I only have to scan through that file.
Yes! This is probably the most efficient way of determining the winner. Modulo operations are perfect for rock-paper-scissor games.
yes, just setup with npm or yarn as usual.
&gt; I created a GitHub page but it doesn’t have much so far other than couple of webscraping and data visualization in addition to some of the api scrapes and apps I made. GitHub can be a bit of a double edged sword - a poorly maintained GitHub full of unfinished projects is worse than no GitHub at all
scss libs available for python for css frameworks such as bootstrap etc just install it as normal web projects
Thank you, this is pretty amazing. I can't imagine the kind of experience that this answer comes from. 
Now the code gold version....
&gt;Is there a library or reference list of some sort listing different codes and functions and what each one does? If I understand correctly, you're looking for documentation? You could start with python documentation from their main website [here](http://www.python.org). Just choose the appropriate version that you have installed on your machine. As for learning Python interactively... Python is a scripting language that interprets rather than compiles, something that most other languages do. That is as interactive as it gets, in my opinion. Another suggestion is to pick up a book that's written for children to learn Python. It is sufficiently peppered with activities to get your hands dirty. Not endorsing anything but you can check [this](https://imgur.com/a/KIUHBdy) out. 
first off look at kp-cli project, in perl though. You want to securely move password files around to different devices not have them stuck on one or use a well known 'thing' as the shared secret. I do not know much about crypto so this is a bit vague. 
You should make one object for every 5 options, and make them know which ones they can win. Then you delegate all to the objects and it ends a lot more simple, with a lot less code
And just to expand, checking if its false is 'while not play:'
Could't agree more - I have seen that talk so many times now! I just wanted to drive home a 'feel' for concurrency using concepts people already know very well - i.e. threads. This article is not supposed to be a rigorous treatment of the subject.
Thank you !
Yes. I think I will document these finer details in an appendix.
If you don't want to install new libraries you have urllib2 and re as standard libraries. Read the page with urllib2 and regex/match with re, then write to file.
Hence the air quotes. Lol. I wasn't implying anything and what I made wasn't the greatest thing ever. I have previous programming experience and (I'll get hate for this for sure) but at age 12 I was practicing Lua on ROBLOX and I did that for like 2 years. I spent my whole childhood playing video games and after that I was online schooled and during that I practice Python. I have lots of computer experience and "tech" experience and saying I went on an "ego trip" for stating I made a copy of a SUPER SIMPLE game, and that because I know it isn't the hardest thing to replicate that and learn from that isn't putting "anyone down". If anything the only person putting anyone down here is YOU and that was to me saying I supported someone in what they were doing, and my comment was meant to be in good light. Programming is fun, and is hard if you make it hard. I enjoyed it and actually had fun programming and figuring out my bugs. I once had a dream that there were people made of code and their arms were strings of code connected to each other showing how necessary it was to rely on "others." I woke up that day feeling great, and that dream helped me figure out an issue I had in my code. If only we as humans could be like that and not be so hateful and arrogant. The enemy pong tried to (and usually succeeded in) predicted before hand if the player was going to move up or down so there was a challenge. So in the end, sure, go ahead and hate on me. But the only thing you're doing is inserting negative vibes in place where that is totally unneeded.
I also had previous experience in programming but for some reason people assumed that wasn't the case. Lol. What is unsaid isn't always the untruth.
just go through [this](https://github.com/ameenpv/PyScrapped)
Courses? I did this as part of the python class. 
Yes, I agree it's quite difficult. Just want to also document here, some cons of solely relying on threads though 1. When you rely **solely** on threads for your concurrency needs, you leave a lot of "cpu juice" on the table. What if you had a maximum of 20 threads, and your concurrency needs are for 40 parallel downloads. While each of those 20 threads is idle, you are essentially wasting your cpu. That is why I took a single threaded example in the post - to demonstrate that even within a single thread, there is a lot of scope for concurrency. 2. Threads don't come cheap i.e. fixed memory requirements per thread's stack, context switching costs etc.
sign up for Microsoft Visual Studio. Get coupon for Pluralsight (3 months). Choose the "Python path" from pluralsight and complete those tuts in order.
TIL then
Yup! I tried to edit it in earlier and Reddit crapped out for me :( thanks! 
You must be new here :)
I can smell the bullshit all the way over here 
So the word "semester" has me wondering.. Do you think school actually helped in your programming, or do you think if you were to WANT that and do that at your own volition it would have worked "better." (air quotes again lol)
.lower() then .capitalize, why?
And twenty factories
That depends on implementation, for any linux install post glibc 2.3.3 (2004) \_fork()\_ is just a fork() wrapper around \_clone()\_. Check under \`NOTES\` here, and there are still implications but under linux/docker a call to fork() is roughly equivalent to a call to clone(2) specifying flags as SIGCHLD [http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html) I do not know if you are working under Windows or MacOS if this is true, but it is POSIX driven IIRC.
Most of the people are satisfied with REST + flask. Microservices is a pretty simple concept, especially if you are building an average application. Why do you need load balancer if you are new to this? Are you planning to build second netflix? 
I made a refactored version of the game that reads in a text file containing the rules of the game, builds a graph, and then plays the game with you. Have a gander: [Rules](https://pastebin.com/Af5zVKe1) [Code](https://pastebin.com/rAnudxCT)
I'm just thinking ahead since I'm reading about microservices. I thought the idea of being able to scale a particular service only would be a good idea and probably one of the reasons for using microservices.
Are there case's in Python?
No, I wish.
Good call :)
Microservices are very useful when you need to use different languages. That's the most popular use case I think.
You can create a dictionary of lists where a key is the action i.e. Rock, Paper, Scissor etc and values are the actions it can beat. Then you can get the values of losing actions based on the player's action and see if the computer's action is in that list or not. If it is, the computer loses and if it's not then computer wins. You'd have to check for equality before you do this tho. This way you won't have to have an if statement for every possible action.
&gt; how does performance compare? As someone who hasn't read the actual source for either project, it seemed like apistar was doing something significantly different which allowed it to be drastically faster than other frameworks by using its static knowledge of what a given route required from a request. Do you know if I'm correct, slash if the same kinds of benefits apply to molton? In my tests, molten is a little faster but not significantly. Neither library does any static optimization and the speed gains over other libraries mostly come from being lazy: the DI system makes it so that your routes only ever parse request input, cookies and other stuff like that when your handlers request them. 
You could try something like if player == "paper": if computer in ['scissors', 'lizard']: player_lose() else: player_win()
I like to separate front-end from back-end when it comes to React, so I just create a separate repository with all that js stuff.

Does the license apply when you go from one language to another? Yours is a separate tool, written from scratch is it not? You just replicated an idea/product.

Nope, it's derived from source project, as you know, Node.js has many in common with Python. The license rule applies.
I have only ever written code for myself and found they made methods less readable and I eventually stopped using them. I am unsure how useful they would be in projects I share with other people.
Use snake case for names except for classes names
Yes, that's one of the reasons. But other auxiliary tools like service discovery and such are going to help.
Google creating a great LinkedIn page - it won't work wonders, though it's good to have. How about looking for a job where you can use your python skills though it isn't a 'pure' coding job? Say somewhere where they use a load of data, and you see an opportunity to use Python to help? Engineering consultancies are using loads of coders now
Why being rude? If you don’t like my opinion you can just ignore it! 
The only correct answer.
You missed the customized messages depending on the combination. I'd do outcomes = { ('Paper', 'Rock'): 'covers', ... } if (player, computer) in outcomes: print(f'You win! {player} {outcomes[player, computer]} {computer}.') elif (computer, player) in outcomes: ... else: print (f'Invalid choice {player}', file=sys.stderr)
We run a lot of python microservices at work (using gunicorn + [falcon](https://falconframework.org). We use docker and docker swarm to take care of scaling, load balancing etc. Since our microservices are written in a mix of languages, it's more important to use common tooling across them all, rather than relying on a single language's frameworks or features.
Unless you are writing an i/o or utility library that wants to support both. I've managed to work around this to some degree by only reimplementing the very top level functions in an async and sync version but still doesn't feel great. 
What's usually recommended to implement case functionality in Python is to simply use dictionaries, where the values for the variable you match are the keys and the consequence for a successful match is in the respective dictionary value.
You don't need the json module. requests provides a json function: scheduleBridgeData = scheduleResponse.json()
I'm not offending you. I'm stating facts. Someone said that it took them two months to make a pong game and then you come in and say that it took you two weeks to make it all with extra features. What you did didn't help the commentor, all that did was bring them down, seriously how does "I did something way faster than you with more features" support anyone? I didn't need a monologue either, modding in Roblox Lua doesn't make you a saint.
Generators are not functions either.
oh god, my pet peeve! do computer = random.choice(options) instead of computer = options[random.randint(0,4)] As is, it not only has magic numbers, but you have to change the numbers if your list changes size. And, IMO, it's not as clear what's going on and it's harder to visually parse 
hey, you should check out /r/learnpython 
You can implement the microservice with REST api using flask. Then you do load balancing by putting uWSGI service and nginx in front of it. If you need to serve let's say more than 10k requests per second, you can replicate this setup to more machines, and load balance them with another VM with nginx. To sum it up, you implement the microservice with python, while the load balancing is done by external service.

I believe you should first learn how to spell correctly, then learn how to speak decently with the community. One of the positives of Python community that it’s very warm and welcoming, please don’t let that perception fade away with childish behavior just because you can’t accept the fact that you are not the ultimate truth.
Maybe something like this? #!/usr/bin/env python3 from random import randint options = ["rock","paper","scissors","lizard","spock"] magic = 5843500 def game_iteration(): user_in = input("Rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock?\n").lower() if user_in == "exit": return False if not user_in in options: print("Bad input.") return True user = options.index(user_in) ai = randint(0,4) print("Player: ",options[user].capitalize()) print("Computer: ",options[ai].capitalize()) if user == ai: print("Tie") else: if (magic&gt;&gt;(user*5+ai))&amp;1: print("You win!") else: print("You lose.") return True def main(): while game_iteration(): pass if __name__ == "__main__": main()

Try looking into the Session object for connection persistence. For json parsing the u-json lib is much faster. 
You don't need to do `if something == True` or `if something == False`, just `if something` or `if not something` 
&gt;I've tried to look for Python libraries on service discovery, client load balancer, hystrix, etc Other than hystrix, these don't seem to me to be "library" things. I mean, you can use consul for service discovery and HAProxy for load balancing.
Perhaps you should try [Trio](https://trio.readthedocs.io), instead.

As someone who helped write 3 frontend package managers/bundlers for Python (hurry.resource, Fanstatic and bowerstatic) I still say yes, use a JS package manager. Use something like yarn with webpack to manage your frontend bundle. I worked on those package managers (except bowerstatic) before frontend packaging was mature at all. bowerstatic had special circumstances in its genesis.

I use it. I quite like it. It's more of a documentation tool for me, rather than a "type safety" feature. It documents the APIs you write, which helps you write saner ones. For example, it tells you when you accept arguments of vastly different interfaces, or if you can return more than one data type. If you find type annotations difficult, that is an indication something might be wrong with your API. Traditionally Python has lacked documentation for types, so if you look at the docs for the standard library it is very often difficult to tell what a function accepts. For example, look at this part of the docs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.writer The function signature looks like this: ```python def writer(csvfile, dialect='excel', **fmtparams): ... ``` What type is `csvfile`? Is it a string, or a file-like object? Also what does `csv.writer()` return? I need to look through the wall of text in the next paragraph to know these answers. In contrast, it could have been something like this: ``` def writer(csvfile: File, dialect: str='excel', **fmtparams) -&gt; CsvWriter: ... ``` And the interface is far clearer. Note that you don't need type annotations to include types in docs. Look at Ruby's docs for example: https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/Array.html#method-i-assoc Remember, it's just an optional tool so if you have a good reason you could always selectively skip it. The other thing is, it helps with Intellisense in my editor (VSCode), which is also pretty cool.
Nice! Small suggestion: player = raw_input("Please select: Rock, paper, scissors, lizard or Spock\n").lower() The instructions should come from `graph.keys()` as well.

I disagree. This code needs less conditions period, which is easily achieved, as opposed to just sticking that conditional logic into a different control structures. 
Typically when you do this, a thread returns a sequence number as well as the data, or you use some global mutex that contains the number of bytes read so far.
I'm not an expert, so please someone correct me if I'm wrong. If you don't need the precision of open cascade, your best bet might be to use something else to convert the step file to a more manageable (like blender - which could be automated). Then you'll have more options for your real time simulation, including VTK. I'm currently trying to use pythonOCC (the python wrapper for open cascade) and the documentation is incredibly confusing. I can't even translate/rotate my imported step files yet! I'm a noob, but those are my two cents. Good luck!
This is currently what I'm doing (or very similar), however your reading the bytes into memory when using this case. I have a working threaded download that is doing exactly this, however I have to increase my java heap size, PermGen, ect to support larger download files. When using a single thread I can buffer smaller chunks in memory and write to file, so JVM memory does not get clogged up. When running a single thread with a buffer the download is serialized so it's easy to reconstruct. I'm looking to implement something like three threads and three buffers that either run an order based file write operation based on thread # or maybe write each thread to it's own temp file then append the three files? Just not sure on this one for best approach.
I don't understand why you have to buffer the whole thing. A thread can request chunk X, and only chunk X. Then since you have chunk X, and you know how far into the file chunk X is, you can seek the position in the output file on the file system and save it exactly there.
Yeah but you could improve and condense everything in any script but it's gunna be really hard to read for anyone working on a project with you or if you have it up on GitHub for people to contribute to, making everything compact as possible is going to drastically decrease readability
What
#TIL THEN
Well obviously it's not needed, this code proves that point but if you could use case statements this would be an appropriate place to use them
Thanks, repeating what I already read in bold and all caps really helped my understanding of the statement
I also encountered much difficulty figuring out PythonOCC. It seems like it's a not too common tool as many of the help links I found are broken. May I ask why you chose it over VTK or other solutions? Isn't using Blender\\STL files formats, which VTK can import, will take more resources compared to STEP files?
I agree with this. The definition of concurrency made me wince... But I kept reading. Then I ran into: &gt;A subroutine is your good old-fashioned function (in the mathematical sense of the term). and I came here. I'm glad to see I'm not the only one. OP: don't use words for the sake of words. If, as you say, your article isn't meant to be a rigorous treatise, then don't insinuate it is.
When dealing with STEP / IGES, pythonocc is the ticket. You can mesh the loaded CAD models and use the mesh data in whatever graphics environment. See [this example](https://github.com/tpaviot/pythonocc-demos/blob/02ad16678a01f2047d110331f77c8ceabd34bfb3/examples/core_export_step_ap203.py) how to load a STEP file. By exploring the [`ThreeJS` renderer](https://github.com/tpaviot/pythonocc-demos/blob/02ad16678a01f2047d110331f77c8ceabd34bfb3/examples/core_webgl_threejs_random_toruses.py), you'll have a good idea how to plugin your own rendering backend. That said, installing pythonocc is very straightfwd these days with `conda`: ` # install pythonocc in the active environment with python 3.5 conda install -c conda-forge -c dlr-sc -c pythonocc -c oce pythonocc-core==0.18.1 python=3.5 `
&gt; Python is a scripting language that interprets rather than compiles, I'm curious what you think .pyc files are, and what the ``compile`` built-in function does. &gt; something that most other languages do. I wouldn't want to put money on "most" languages being compilers rather than interpreters. Even if there was no overlap (and there certainly is, enough to make the distinction pretty meaningless) its not clear which style would be in the majority.
When I want a better DateTime, in practical terms, which one is better and in which way, Pendulum or Arrow?
I wasn't realy trying to offer complete solution
Yeah, I should have given more thought to that statement. I have corrected it. I wanted to convey the statelessness of the subroutine itself (even if its a method). Regarding the concurrency definition, I have tweaked that statement to make it sound like it is an example of concurrency, and not the definition of the concept itself. This is what I had wanted all along. It was meant to be a statement like "Happiness is when you ....", which describes a manifestation of the concept, and not the definition itself.
I'll take a look today and see if I can write something up along these lines of thinking.
can i see the site? You can use from html.parser import HTMLParser class Parser(HTMLParser): def handle_starttag(self, tag, attrs): print(tag, attrs) p = Parser() p.feed(&lt;data&gt;) You can use some ifs to parse tags and attributes. Here's some example code that scapes urls from thumbzilla and can be piped to youtube-dl to mass download porn videos. import sys from html.parser import HTMLParser from urllib.request import urlopen website = "[https://www.thumbzilla.com](https://www.thumbzilla.com)" class Parser(HTMLParser): def handle\_starttag(self, tag, attrs): if tag == "a": if attrs\[0\] == ("class", "js-thumb"): start = 1 stop = attrs\[1\]\[1\].find("\]") i = attrs\[1\]\[1\].strip() print("{0}{1}".format(website, i)) parser = Parser() parser.feed([sys.stdin.read](https://sys.stdin.read)())
Today I Learned To be honest I mixed up Java and Python in my original post so I feel like a dummy 
I would also add the other domains as config (UK, IT, ES, DE, FR) 
How about a buffer in memory where you temporarily store several inputs then save them to the database in one call.
That’s not what I’m saying at all. I can assure the code as it stands would never be accepted by any professional code review, whether you used ifs or switch style branching. It needs to be dried out and the concerns separated.
\&gt; **Are you currently using type annotations?** Yes. \&gt; **If so, what is your experience so far?** Mostly good, because it greatly improves code readability and \`mypy\` allows to catch some bugs. However, \`mypy\` is still not very mature and some bugs in \`mypy\` itself can be annoying sometimes.
Awesome!!! :D .. Do you think in make this on others platforms ? mobile pwa with notifications... Does this is private, isn't ?
Das cold dawg.
Absolutely. There's a ton of things I wouldn't have bothered learning (bit shifting, sockets, PHP, industrial controllers) if school hadn't forced me to learn.
I'm just guessing here, but I don't think you can specify a range of cells. I think it just exports an entire sheet into a picture (PNG) file. The function needs three arguments, but in some cases, as here, the third one is not used. "None" is an empty, or null, object. It doesn't contain anything, but it can be used to fill in for things like required arguments, as it is here.
The results you are getting are obviously bad, the orbits are pretty far from being closed (periodic) as they should be. The one-body problem (a single mass in a force field provided by a static source of gravity) isn't much fun, because it can be solved exactly with pencil and paper. The real fun starts when you have at least three bodies, where only some very special solutions are known exactly. I have found three and four body simulations to be entirely doable on a PC with Python, even with real-time animation. The code isn't yet in a state such that I would show it around, though.
Or you could simply use dictionary.
Look below
If your installed Python 3 is managed by apt, there should be a `python3-pygments` that you can install with apt. If that doesn’t work, get it from PyPI: `pip3 install pygments`.
Don't worry bout it aha
yes, next is for upwork. working on that. It will be extended for mobile notification in near future. That is a bit large project, will work on it definitely. 
I'm curious about the Flashtext phenomenon. It's super popular, but it doesn't seem to do anything particularly interesting. Its main claim is for performance, but it only compares itself to the native `re` library, but there are tons of other regexp libraries that perform better for "extreme" situations.
What's database are you running? Have you thought about storing inserts in a temp lightweight database like sqllite, and then loading that data.
why does the article link to dash (cryptocurrency) ? It even features a dash banner - wtf
We use Connexxion for our microservices. It is based on Flask and uses OpenAPI 2.0 specs for validation. For personal projects, I've played with Falcon a bit, but haven't found a good OpenAPI library for it.
Do you use OpenAPI with Falcon? If so, what libraries?
Loading that data and doing what exactly - inserts/batch insert? using a scheduler? appreciate if you can describe the solution
Wouldn't I need than to maintain a scheduler that cleans-up memory periodically which also become a point of failure? This is feasible, I just wonder if there are other framework/patterns that doesn't require to code such a infrastuctural component
Here's an improved version: from random import choice play = True choices = ["rock", "lizard", "spock", "scissors", "paper"] # Compares two choices, returns true if the first wins # False, if the second wins # None if the two are equal # See https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Rock_Paper_Scissors_Lizard_Spock_en.svg def compare(a, b): if a == b: return None elif (choices.index(a) + 1) % len(choices) == choices.index(b) or \ (choices.index(a) + 3) % len(choices) == choices.index(b): return True else: return False # The == true is not necessary (since while checks for truth) while play: computer_choice = choice(choices) user_input = input("Please select one of %s\n" % (", ".join(choices))) user_choice = user_input.lower() # Try again if user input is not valid if not user_input in choices: print("Invalid input") continue print("The computer chose %s" % computer_choice) result = compare(computer_choice, user_choice) if result is None: print("Tie!") elif result: print("Computer wins") else: print("You win!")

It's a good idea to be incredibly paranoid with APIs as you have no real control over what they send you. You're checking their response for 'isUp'. One day it won't be there and you'll crash. Because it's just a simple library and I don't want to spend too long on it, I'd just wrap the whole thing in a try block and define a custom exception it can throw, with the json response as part of the exception data.

You can install it directly through python. Try `sudo python -m ensurepip`
Which versions of macOS and Python do you have? I'm guessing it's an older version of both and easy_install is not finding what it needs..which makes sense as PyPi has been updated a lot recently.
If you don't mind, I have three follow up questions: 1. Do you know if sdl2 (and it's dependencies) have a python3 variant as well? 2. I've tried going into /etc/apt/source.list to see if I can find valid package names, but I get this repository where I have no idea where to look. Do you know a better way to find a list of packages to install? 3. I'm using apt-get, but you mentioned pip3. Is pip (and pip3) for installing python packages? Is there a source.list for that as well? Sorry for accidentally turning this into a pseudo /r/linux4noobs
&gt; Do you know if sdl2 (and it's dependencies) have a python3 variant as well? Probably, but it's a toss-up whether your Linux distribution has packaged it. If not, you should be able to install the underlying C libraries with apt, then install the Python-specific components with pip. &gt; I've tried going into /etc/apt/source.list to see if I can find valid package names, but I get this repository where I have no idea where to look. Do you know a better way to find a list of packages to install? I always have to google how to do this with the command-line tools myself. Best bet is to use your Linux distro's online directory: packages.debian.org or packages.ubuntu.com. &gt; I'm using apt-get, but you mentioned pip3. Is pip (and pip3) for installing python packages? Is there a source.list for that as well? The [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/) is a repository of packages that can be installed on effectively any system with an appropriate version of Python. `pip` is the command-line tool to install and manage packages from PyPI. `pip3` normally means "the copy of `pip` that corresponds to the Python you'd get by running `python3`".
You should use `user_in not in options` instead of `not user_in in options`.

scrapy is not even in python 3...
I've spent the past seven months working with pythonOCC on a professional project. Good luck, it's not friendly. 
It's more open than MATLAB. It's faster and easier to write than, say, C. It makes more sense for scripting than java, C++ etc. It's easier to fold C libraries etc. into than some other languages. It's a fully featured language, unlike R, which is a statistics package with some scripting tagged onto the end. It already had a scientific ecosystem (numpy etc.).
Can't really help you without the code (with the tokens and oauth app info redacted, of course). To say "I'm getting the wrong page from the server without even saying what that wrong page *is* doesn't help either.
what kind of information? Seems like a tough sell because almost all market data platforms have little blurbs for quick searches, not sure why people don't use them. Because this is finance and you cannot really afford to be wrong (e.g. the user will get super pissed ) I would probably develop a few basic working schemas of what data you want to pull and send, and then create a few different commands. It would be better to guide the user into how to search for things instead of trying to handle robust inputs. 
Spyder is included within anaconda. What exactly is the error, my guess is that ArcGIS does not have the proper python path (to anaconda) listed for your project.
A chatbot isn't a particularly complicated application. You can look for existing open-source bot platforms. Here is a [python bot guide](https://www.fullstackpython.com/bots.html). You have to look into your chat platform and see what its capabilities are, and what options it gives you. The 'bot' itself is just a webapp with an endpoint that takes in statements made to the bot. It runs regular expressions on it, both to identify what is being asked of the bot and to extract parameters for that action. The bot performs that action, then forms a sentence informing the requester of the status of the request. Example: /didibot Give me cheese. You might have a configured capability of your bot such that it has this regex: /^[Gg]ive me (.*)\.$/ which would match the string and extract 'cheese' as an argument. You'd call whatever service to get 'cheese', and then you'd return 'cheese' gotten or something to the affect if successful; an indication of error if not. Case and punctuation might be really annoying, so you might want to downcase and strip non-alpha characters, maybe. You have to be really cognizant of what a human generated sentence might contain as far as characters. If you've got anyone asking questions in non-english, you'll

\&gt; Python libraries on service discovery, client load balancer, hystrix, etc Why would you need to do any of this with Python? AFAIK, most of such tools are language-agnostic, they don't care what language are you using for your microservices.
Yup, but not with any libraries, just have a separately maintained spec file (our APIs aren't that complex in terms of endpoints/params, so this works ok).
Is there a sample project with these libraries? 
I clicked the API reply button on reddit and typed this into the API box then I API'd it to the internet
Ideally the users should be able to retrieve relevant information about the security they are interested in by, say, type "name idnumber date". Thanks for your tip om the working schemas and commands.
Another small tip: `random.choice(options)` is nicer than `options[random.randint(0, 4)]`. Easier to read, will keep working no matter the lenght of options, etc.
Just use tuples as dictionary keys eg `(player, computer) in move_dict`. Protip: anything on which you can call hash function, can be used as dictionary key.
But what url *do* you get?

Thanks for your tips, but my question is directed towards something else. Maybe I have not been specific enough. My intent is to write a Chabot program in Python that allows our traders via their Bloomberg terminal chat box application to give in structured command lines such as "[name] [idnumber] [date]" that the Chabot will interpret as a query to the API of another financial information platform (Reuters) and in return will output the information such as price, bid/ask and trading volume in the Bloomberg chat box. Would this be possible and if it is, what would a technical roadmap look like for this?
But... It's not correct though. A concurrent algorithm can behave in the manner you described as "concurrency", but it can also not. Writing a concurrent algorithm is a very important (and difficult) skill. If someone walks away from your article thinking they're good at writing concurrent algorithms because of your description, you've done them a huge disservice. I mean, your description is _so_ off the mark, I'm wondering if you came away from Pike's talk with the right idea at all. :/
Also to clarify, they're not written in python. They're written for python. Most ML and numerical libraries are written in other languages and exposed to python. Tensorflow, torch, scipy etc are written in a mix of compiled languages .

I'm taking an "Intro to Scripting" class that uses Python and we're about 4 or 5 weeks in at this point. The professor isn't the best about providing feedback, although my homework/project scores have been good. If anyone is interested and has a spare moment, I'd love some feedback/constructive criticism on my projects. Please keep in mind, I'm not asking for "homework answers" or anything of the sort.

I've been using VS Code recently because I was having an issue importing libraries and what not. VS code was working right after installing the 2(or 3)extensions needed.

True, in most cases this would be the better solutation. Here, it makes the return value more explicit (it's easier to see what and of which type is returned, since the condition is quite complex and could as well return an integer)
PyCharm, personally. I use a lot of other JetBrains IDEs and can only say good things about them. I'm much more productive using an editor I'm familiar with, not having to relearn key mappings or shortcuts. I haven't used VS Code much (never in fact for Python work) so I can't really give a fair comparison. I would say go with whichever you have had experience of previously.
Simplest answer is to fix the problem with your database. You can optimize the database to handle your inserts better, or you can throw hardware at it. 
I prefer Pycharm. My current workstation is powerful enough to handle it without batting an eyelash, and it gives me access to a lot more tools. I still use vim for small stuff and especially on remote machines, but if I'm working on a large product I want to be able to manage it effectively. Pycharm gives me a lot of tools to do that. - Direct database integration so I can actually poke around and see what's going on and make changes on the fly. - language support with linting and debugging with minimal setup - terminal in window that automatically picks up my venv - git integration to track where I am and what I've modifird - integration for other platforms like Travis, Jenkins, AWS, GCP, etc I'm willing to spend the money to have mature and integrated tools to do my job. 
This is what I replied to: &gt;Yea this. After 2 days of coding, makes a 100 Line game...with almost no prior experience. Umm ok That's negative as shit compared to what I said. And I wasn't trying to be negative or anything. &gt; Ok kid chill out. I'm chill. You're the one being a dick. My post was meant to show that if you put your mind to it it might not be a challenge. &gt;There's no need to bring others down and go on an ego trip at the same time. (You're literally doing this. Take a step back and think for a second.) &gt;What you did didn't help the commentor (I wasn't even trying to help the commentor a all? In fact I disagreed with them so I showed that? It's not putting anybody down. Point out to me who I'm putting down. Lol.) &gt;I didn't need a monologue either (I was providing my background, because it wasn't just "done in two weeks") &gt;modding in Roblox Lua doesn't make you a saint. (but it gives me an understanding of the fundamentals of coding.) Congrats on your 7 upvotes btw.
Can you install via virtualenv?
won't this break if for example player chose paper and the computer chose rock? it treats that the same as the computer choosing rock and the player choosing paper.
No. When I try to install/create a virtualenv I get the same error.
Hop on over to /r/positivepython with your tender self.
Have you checked out the update I had made to those statements ? As I have mentioned in a comment above, this was just an example of the concept of concurrency in action, NOT a definition and I have updated the article to better reflect it. Further, this was not an example of any particular concurrent algorithm (neither the two-threaded application, nor the OS thread scheduler), but of the concept of concurrency itself - that it can exist without parallelism. Further, I have also explicitly stated that concurrency does not imply parallelism. I have also stated later in the article that concurrency is possible inside a single thread. In fact, none of the examples I have posted have any parallelism. I have been extensively coding in Go for the last 2 years, and not once did I think about parallelism.
Mind your own business, I know how to behave properly, and I know how to deal with close minded people.
I love your user name.
pip -U install pip?
Existence of NumPy is also a factor
(*Spyder maintainer here*) We are in the process of simplifying and fixing several errors with this kind of process. From Spyder **3.3** onwards (our next version, to be released next week) you will need to install only the `spyder-kernels` package. But you need to do that in the ArcGis Python interpreter, not in the Anaconda one, for that to work. And after doing that, you will need to change your Python interpreter in Spyder by going to `Tools &gt; Preferences &gt; Python Interpreter &gt; Use the following interpreter` and paste there the full path to your ArcGis interpreter. *Note*: The process is a bit convoluted, we know, so we're also planning to write some documentation about it.
Hmm.... am I missing out? I use Notepad++ only...
AWS Lambda + API Gateway. [Fargate for larger services](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/)
I haven't had time to verify this yet, but I was recently experiencing problems with Pip in a virtualenv and during troubleshooting a friend told me that pip v10 introduced compatibility issues with virtualenv. See if rolling it back to v9 fixes it for ya
&gt;Have you checked out the update I had made to those statements ? No. Let me look. &gt;Concurrency is like having two threads running on a single core CPU. Instructions from each thread could be interleaved, but at any given time, only one of the two threads is actively making progress. Still wrong. If I have a single core CPU, would you claim that because the desktop windowing manager is still running alongside my Fibonacci implementation, the implementation is concurrent? There's no reason to give such a simple analogue to someone who would _need_ such a simple analogue. Those people need an entirely separate article or thirty to become comfortable with the terms of modern comp sci. Don't talk down to the people who are reading your article, _in_ your article.
Yes. 100%.
I’ve been using VSCode to work on some python stuff. It seems it’s having problems automatically detecting my venv and it’s python instance. Every time I boot it up I get “Pipfile exists but failed to run pipenv -venv” so I’ve restored to defining the path to the python instance manually in the workspace settings. I can run -venv just fine in terminal, am I missing something?
I am currently using pip 9.0.1
No such option :\\

It's just wrappers that are written in python. It is way too slow for any practical use in this field. But having the "interfaces" exposed in python is great because how accessible the language is - and that's one of the reasons why it is so popular in science outside of computer science. And ML is of interest to many fields.
Sorry, pip install pip -U Syntax :/
If two threads are running on a single core CPU, would you not say they are running "concurrently" ?
There's pros and cons. On one hand, there are people that need typing to more easily understand code, and it makes things especially easier for people that come from static languages. On the other hand there are people / teams that can keep track of types in their head, and the current typing syntax is messy and if you want to stay away from code that looks visibly bloated.
Got it, thanks for the ping.
What the above guys said, plus, as a possible first language, it's very expressive, from a human perspective which I think makes it easy to pick up and run with. And when you're doing your PhD in whatever, the easier a tool is to pick up, the better. Does feel very much like writing sentences which are interpreted as code. Plus a LOT of the ML libs are actually written in C, which entirely sidesteps a lot of the "but it's an interpreted language!" concern. 
This is how I usually install/upgrade pip to `curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python` Point the python at the virtualenv youre using
IMO, if the condition is too complex, the best solution is to simplify the condition. Something like: def compare(a, b): if a == b: return None winning_choices = [choices[(choices.index(b) + n) % len(choices)] for n in [2, 4]] return a in winning_choices

The linter in PyCharm (I think they call it "the Inspector") is very powerful. I remember a few years back when we started using it at work, it found many things that our previous environment (Eclipse+PyDev) wouldn't -- though it'd also complain about a few weird constructs we had in our code. But the switch from Eclipse+PyDev gave us a massive increase in readability\* and helped us find a couple of bugs we weren't aware of. That was circa 2014, and PyCharms Inspector has improved with every release. We're looking forward to using type annotations when we get to switch all projects to 3.6. \* we didn't have a good policy about code style, and PyCharm complains a lot about following PEP-8 unless you switch that inspection off. Since we were learning to use it, a few lazy devs found it easier to comply with the inspection rather than find the setting to switch it off.
I love customized. So VS Code
They serve different purposes. One is lighter and more convienent for smaller projects. The other has a lot more power and functions.
Pycharm has power mode. https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8251-power-mode-ii
Nothing I said is inapplicable here. &gt; Would this be possible What is and is not possible is entirely fenced in by your dependencies. What can you do with Bloomberg and what can you do with Reuters? First, figure out how to hook into your chat system. How do you get messages out to a separate service and how does that service write back to the chat system? Second, how do you interface with Reuters? If I were doing this, I'd write a client to both your Bloomberg chat system, and to your Reuters system. Then you can control the interface on both ends of your actual bot logic. Then I'd build a dispatcher that takes in incoming messages, finds the correct code path by regex, calls that function with the extracted arguments, transforms the return value to human meaningful string, and sends it back to the chat app. &gt; give in structured command lines such as "[name] [idnumber] [date]" that the Chabot will interpret ... You do this via regex, as I described above. /^[(.*)] [(.*)] [(.*)]$/ # This regex will turn your request string into three captured values. 
That's great news! Not sure if I made that clear but I currently have the ArcGIS python selected as my interpreter using the method you described. When installing the package in the Anaconda Prompt, do I just need to select the directory housing the relevant Python installation, or do I need to also select the file during installation/how would I do that? Will I have to redownload anything or will Spyder update automatically? Finally, is there a way to change bit type of Spyder on the fly, or do I need the proper installation (OS is 64 bit, trying to check bit type of ArcGIS and having issues with **that** now as well). 
Care to elaborate? I hate the bloat I get with most ides. N++ gives me autocomplete when needed as well as variable listing. I then do tests through cli block by block. And have not run into any issues. Also, love the downvote everyone, this isn't mean to be shit post, it's 100% real
whoooossshhhh
Isn't the interpreter single threaded? I.e. has a GIL. Wasn't lisp the goto language for AI a long time ago?
FYI, it looks like Bloomberg publishes [a Python client](https://github.com/msitt/blpapi-python). 
no, thank *you* :P
&gt; Isn't the interpreter single threaded? Yes, but it doesn't apply to (properly-written) C extensions, which typically do the heavy lifting.
Check your python interpreter verisons Ubuntu doesnt install python 2 as default now on a server. 
Stick to your text editor, you aren't missing out on anything.
All critical parts in libraries are written in C, python essentially only serves as a scripting language here so there is no GIL constraint .
Oohhh good stuff! Thanks for the reply.
C is great because it runs fast, but a python interface is a lot nicer.
Python is a very easy to use language, but the heavy lifting is actually done in C or some other language, and Python is just an interface for controlling it. One of Python’s strengths is the ability to write wrappers to interact with code written in C or other languages so they are easy to use from Python but still very fast. 
That's what I was thinking also! I struggled with this when I took a course awhile back, but I just finished the first week of MITx - problem three taught me that I can write smaller and more efficient code while still maintaining high readability.
You aren't actually supposed to use that plugin. It's just for trolling people who think their IDE has "good plugin support" :-)
Finished week one of MITx and starting week two. I've learned so much but I still feel so small.
Good point!
Yeah, it's possible to do what I said. I just wanted to nudge OP in the right direction without giving everything away.
AI and ML are veryyyy different fields. Lisp hasn’t been the go-to for a while, either. 
 for handling arrays compared to Python w/numpy.
Ah, okay. May have to make one some day. 😀
GIL can be worked around with threading module.
&gt; Most ML and numerical libraries are written in other languages and exposed to python. Ignorant question, but I've always wondered how this works. If you develop software written in different languages, how does this even work, how do different parts communicate with each other? And why would you want to do it? Wouldn't try to make everything together be a hassle compared to making it in a single language? And what does *exposed* to Python mean?

I am working on a simple static site generator to transform configuration files into static websites, for an interactive Detroit: Become Human flowchart, where you can look up the YouTube videos of each choice you make in the game. Currently I'm hand-coding all the HTML, which isn't really efficient, so I'll write a YAML-to-HTML converter in Python, to seperate the content from the markup. [There's a preview of the site here](https://fschutt.github.io/detroit-become-human-flowchart/) but I'm not sure how far I'll get this week.
Emacs
I really appreciate how sneaky this is, fabulous one-liner solution.
I think that's the main reason, many ML libraries in Python were created because of numpy. Sklearn has been introduced 11 years ago and was based solely on numpy.
The Python interpreter is written in C, and can load C libraries. The interface for doing that is exposed to Python code via the `ctypes` library, and also via the extension mechanism.
&gt; GIL can be worked around with ~threading~ multiprocessing module.
It's done by essentially layering python on top of the existing software. So when you do something in python, it is just calling the underlying software (I'm not talking about cython and the like here). So making it exposed to Python simply means writing a Python package that talks to your non-python software. In terms of why, you would write the Python wrapper to make it more accessible/easy to use. You would write the original in another language for speed/performance. Generally speaking, there is a tradeoff between speed/performance and usability - more perfomant languages are harder to develop in. Writing in one of these languages and then writing a wrapper in the easy language is often a good compromise. 
Threading isn't the only way to achieve concurrent execution.
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface
Tried gonum for golang by chance? I've been meaning to do a comparison of it and numpy but haven't gotten around to it yet.
Pycharm Ctrl + Click on class or variable shows you every usage of the variable. If there's one, it takes you to the point of definition/declaration. Unreal for navigation/code inspection.
The hero this thread deserves. :) 
One of the main attractions for Python is how easy it is to glue disparate functions and code together into a cohesive, structured pipeline. ML often needs to fit into a data pipeline to generate predictions automatically and make decisions immediately. So having ML interfaces in Python is more useful than other languages simply because it integrates so easily into existing workflows.
This says enroll and 6-9 hours per week for 12 weeks, is it expected you'll attend video classes, or is that just a recommended pace?
The threads are, but that's a feature of the OS scheduler, not the algorithm running in one process. A concurrent algorithm can run on a single thread. The threadcount and core count are COMPLETELY irrelevant to the concurrency of an algorithm.
Out of sheer curiosity in which programming language you receive: A or B is C?
Check out this vid where the guy uses a chatbot on Instagram. You could possibly use it in your project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Abow8NFd4UE&amp;t=422s
But how does python talk to non python software?
So what if its a feature of the OS scheduler - this is a valid example of concurrent execution. In fact I never even say that the two threads belong to a single process, and that process is therefore concurrently written. It's just two random threads running on a single core CPU. Of course thread count and core count do not matter to the definition of concurrency. I reiterate, this is just an example.

I'm really digging your visual design here. And kudos for going the static-site route. Not everything requires backend logic!

Because everybody lurves python, it’s the future! :D
Go astroturf somewhere else.
is that the correct pip for the interpreter you're using? you should be running `python -m pip install ...` as that will launcher he correct pip for the interpreter.
But you've written it as if it's a _definition_, not an _example_.
 &gt;1. I've tried going into /etc/apt/source.list to see if I can find valid package names, but I get this repository where I have no idea where to look. Do you know a better way to find a list of packages to install? You can use *apt-cache search yoursearchterm* for this. 
I've nearly completed all of the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) problems, including past years: http://adventofcode.com/events I know it's not a project per se, but it's a huge job to complete all 75 questions. I only have 20 (of 150) stars to go. 3,870 lines of code thus far. Really super fun, highly recommended. Just wanted to share in case people hadn't heard of it.
As someone who's used both for development with python I'd say PyCharm Community is definitely my preference for python development. The tool suite they provide is great, the integrated vcs functionality is quite good, the interpreter itself is fantastic I've found and it just seems to me like a better development suite for python than vs code. It's not as lightweight or customisable(one of the main reasons I use vs code, the thing boots up in like a millisecond I've found) there is some support for other languages considering it's an intellij Íde that's to be expected. For purely python go with PyCharm if you're doing other stuff to I'd say use both but try steer clear of python with vs code. 
I personally use PyCharm pro after outgrowing PyCharm community. I like both PyCharm and VS, but have a preference for PyCharm.

For what it is worth, I also needed to `pip install untwisted` Playing with it now but I feel like if I am going to deal with a modal editor, I'd rather it be in the terminal (like Vim or Emacs...which I know isn't modal). Having it in its own window means I really don't need modality. But that is just my opinion

I don't think you need any separate library other than standard Python. For parsing dates, take a look at [datetime.strptime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strptime). For everything else, the [regular expression module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) should do the trick. I would parse the date first, then search the remainder of the string for "A Positive" or other blood groups. The part before that is then the name. Etc.
Because nothing in this article was proofed. None of the sentences make sense ("pendulum is the best library for making pendulum"), there are 2 libraries that are thin date time wrappers, and like 4 libraries for DNNs, none of which are Keras, and one of which is deprecated (theano).

I think it has a lot to do with the community that is using the tool... in my experience as a social scientist many in the academic, economics, bio-infomatics research fields use R because of the strong statistical base useability of the tool. On the [ML.AI](https://ML.AI) side of the equation you have mostly computer science and software engineering disciplines driving this bus so a language like Python is a natural fit. They both work well and overlap in many ways... I think it just depends upon your point of reference and the preferences dictated by your profession.
VSCode because I use it for everything. Python? Yes. C++? Yes. Arduino? Yup. I haven't found something it doesn't support.
The scientific stack (scipy + numpy) in python is very mature. It will take a while to other languages to catch up.
N++ also highlights all instances of variables and classnames. Hell, it highlights every usage of any word selected
As others have said, the heavy lifting is done in C/C++ and only a python interface is exposed in most places. The reasons python has won out as a glue language is likely many-fold but I see primarily 4 factors: low barrier to entry, general purpose extensibility, community, tradition. Python's low barrier to entry is well renowned. The language when first approaching it is relatively simple and unsurprising. Syntax is reminscient of normal imperative syntax (c-like) and there are many common-sense defaults. In addition, the standard library is huge and when something is missing, basic package management is a breeze. All of this results in something easy to lick up as a new user, and thus python is a good target for a glue code language (over more complex examples such as C/C++/Rust or even Java). While the low barrier to entry is catalytic, the general extensibility gives Python staying power. It is possible to write extensive amounts of code, and then package it up into a neat little API and put a cute bow on top. This is nice for package authors. In addition, Python is general purpose (winning out over R and MATLAB, or other, more domain specific languages) so an entire pipeline can be written in it. Data collection, transformation, computation, visualization, and management can all be written in Python. The above have led to a rich community with diverse interests and high standards. To most of the community, user (that is, programmer) experience matters, and it shows. Documentation is abundant and large amounts of yak shaving are abhorred. Standards are sought and the language continues to grow (f-strings are a dream). The language is not without its warts, but workarounds are known, shared, and discoverable. Finally we have the most impactful factor, tradition. As noted by other commentators, numpy is amazing. This led to other scientific work being done in Python. A need for effective visualization grew, and so came matplotlib. The more that happened in Python, the more attractive it became as a target language. This generated a positive feedback loop leading to the general dominance that is seen today.
Do you have scipy installed as well? Believe that's a dependency of sklearn.
That module sucks (eg. by using pickle), use subprocess and build something better with that.
I tried to make a name shortening code which only works for massively long alien names and can be pretty funny at times. Some of the results include "Thot","Goreman","Sith","Say Exit" and other things. You could probably make it drop the F bomb just by telling it that your name was Fullerman Rathock or something because it has four different methods. One would return the F bomb, another would return Fullhock, another would be "ockc" and they only work if you shove in something like "Ariovercien" or "Morthacallimus". Names with little vowels like Cthulhu or Ry'lyeh just don't work.
Exactly this. There was already a healthy Python community around econometrics, from pandas to numpy to scipy to matplotlib. ML is a land where econometric statistical reports generation comes to life and it should come as no surprise that Python is right in the thick of things.
what about the large available codebase thats provided by python community? it allows you quickly come up with new plugins. it also gives you the possibility of customizing it according to your needs.
It's about python 2...
the modal word in the context it stands for something else though.
Why not like xi or neovim? What does this offer that those don't?

Hoping someone can help me in my endeavor to learn some programming (more specifically, Python). I'm a Finance graduate who's looking to get ahead of the curve and teach myself python, R, and SQL. I basically want to self-learn data science in conjunction with my finance background to get into a top firm and catapult my pay grade. What/where is the best place to start? Is it reasonable/realistic to teach myself programming, automation, and data science?
I understand not wanting to read through a bunch of technical links to find an answer, so let me answer it in an ELI5 way, understanding that the answer will not be the complete answer. A DLL is like an executable that contains a chunk of native code. These are usually created in C/C++. Python, specifically CPython, the one most commonly used, provides a set of built-in magic functions that can load, interpret, and talk to, the DLL. So, in Python, you can load the DLL, and call the functions from Python as exposed through magic interfaces provided by CPython. Now, *this* works because CPython is written in C(++). C/C++ code can load DLLs no problem. So, CPython can load the DLLs no problem. It is a simple matter to go from there to having CPython expose the functionality of the DLL using magic, built-in, easy to use Python interfaces.

The Matlab interface to numerical data is a treat. And the fact that Python can emulate much of that numerical interface is miraculous, to be honest.
The Python interpreter from python.org is written in C, so tacking C code onto it [is fairly simple](https://docs.python.org/3.6/extending/extending.html), as is accessing [C functions from within Python](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/ctypes.html). Actually, many modules in the Standard Python Library are written in C. C can easily act as a bridge to other languages. 
Thanks for posting. I think I'd like to emphasise with the ever growing number and variety of asyncio based web frameworks that ASGI really is in the best interests of the community. In this article I try to show this by advocating that as Quart is now an ASGI framework users can choose between ASGI servers, notably Hypercorn for HTTP/2 or Uvicorn for HTTP/1 performance (roughly speaking).

Please don't execute commands containing arbitrary user input. 
&gt; By "help you" you mean do it for you because you are utterly incapable? They all mean that really.
Yes. Might need to XBox less for a while-- it will take time and effort. Where to start... were I in your shoes, I would blow through the latest Python 3 for Dummies-- no joke. Don't care just put each word in front of your eyes. Speed read that fucker. I treat Dummies books as "Primers". It exposes you to a base set of thoughts and vocabulary even if you don't understand it. Then you sit down with a more quality resource-- The Head First series generally does okay. http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920003434.do This one covers Python 3. (Python 2.x is in the process of being depracated, but it is taking a long time because there is a lot of old code out there and it is still installed by default on a lot of linux distros... which is slowing down the transition.) From there, find your heroes on Gitlab or Github and start looking at cool projects that are like what you aspire to accomplish. Line by line figure out what is happening. That is my advice, the Dummies book-- I am going to stick to my guns, then next intermediate one you may need to research if you don't like my suggestion, and lastly seeing what "good" programmers do and following their work by getting up to your elbows in it is as good as it gets for non-interactive mentoring.
I love N++, but for programming, it misses good git integration, and that's a deal-breaker for me. How do you go around this problem?
The rationale behind vy it is supported by the fact that python has a large code base (a lot of packages out there) it turns development of new features easier/quicker. It also uses tkinter thats a really simple but productive framework. The simplicity of it is intrinsically related to its degree of productivity. If you take a look at this vy plugin [https://github.com/vyapp/vyirc](https://github.com/vyapp/vyirc) you'll see it implements a completely function irc client thats liable of being extended through plugins. It demonstrates the power of vy plugin api summed up with the fruitful python packages environment. Thus the main difference between vy and other editors consists of the concision of its plugins altogether with the development time of them.
I evaluated PyCharm a few times, but its slowness was always a deal-breaker for me... I just cannot stand that it doesn't have quick enough response. Also, VS Code has better git integration in my opinion, so I use VS Code. But I admit that for example debugging and Intellisense could be better.
As far as the quality and usability of the software goes, I much prefer all of the JetBrains IDEs over Visual Studio any day of the week. PyCharm is a wonderful piece of software with a lot of functionality out-of-the-box. Comparatively, VS is slow, clunky, and a sub-par user experience. If I had to attribute a reason to the difference in user experience it would be this: VS has to contend with many masters, while PyCharm is build for Python and Pythonistas. PyCharm is a curated experience built for Python developers. Visual Studio is warped and tangled by its history; it's still a 32-bit application. Then again, if you like the user experience of other MS products like Bing or MSN, and don't mind the interface being unresponsive for multiple seconds at a time, you may like the VS interface. Finally, if you ever have to switch modes to Ruby/C++/.NET/etc, the other JetBrains IDEs are tailored for those languages and are equally pleasant to use. My experience is with the professional versions of these tools, but the same should hold true in community versions.
A flask app on Apache should work. 
I believe neovim has python plugins as well, no?
My philosophy is to only give only a few suggestions at a time for beginners to focus on. The first thing that jumps at me is your use of multiple calls to `print()`. So, to write multiple blank lines, instead of something like print() print() print() I would write print('\n\n') each `\n` adding a new line. Even better, if you want to print a long text, I would use triple-quoted strings. Something like print(""" ========================= This is my program ========================= Please follow the instructions .... """) This, in my opinion, would make your program easier to read.
That's where I'm missing out I suppose. Currently I do not use any git service and create daily backups of my work to separate servers. My work is proprietary and loading anywhere other than a local server can land me in hot water
I'm aware that's common conception, but I've yet to see any in-depth comparison between the two that demonstrates this with a feature comparison and benchmarks.
yes, i think so, but the power of its api is limited. In vy you have tools to do async tasks working out of the box. The vy widgets are plain python objects you can dynamically interact with them.
Oh my, VS Code is not VS https://code.visualstudio.com/ 
Ummmmm you did link the full url. Do they not have an API documentation? Follow that and if it's wrong email their support. Otherwise you're out of luck unless you completely reverse engineer their auth flow.
You don't need to upload to a public Git hub. PyCharm supports multiple source control system. I use it to integrate with BitBucket at home and a private Hg repo when using it at work.
No :( and I did not share the full link? you do not have the client\_id, state and nonce.
take a look at [https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/circe](https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/circe) thats an irc client plugin for emacs, you'll see it is much larger than the one thats implemented for vy. It doesn't allow you to develop plugins for the irc client. In vyirc you can even write an irc bot on top of it (thanks to python/untwisted though).
don't know if this one can help you but check it [pythoncheatsheet.org](https://www.pythonchetsheet.org)
Emacs isn't neovim and uses a different scripting language (emacs lisp). I wasn't talking about emacs.
Sneaky bitmath is sneaky.
Hmm. My understanding was that VS Code is a free version of VS with most of the features yanked out of it. Based on some of [these answers](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30527522/what-are-the-differences-between-visual-studio-code-and-visual-studio) seems like it's more of a text editor than an IDE, compared to the other VS offerings.
You googled this, right? Like you tried to do even a tiny bit of research on your own, didn't you?
I wanted an example one to help teach someone python/programming and settled on something similar to your outcomes dictionary. Eventually I decided that I prefered a version that didn't include the customized message in favor of a vague "x beats y" instead. I settled on this: import random options_map = {"rock":["scissors"], "paper":["rock"], "scissors":["paper"]} #options_map = {"rock":["lizard","scissors"], # "paper":["spock","rock"], # "scissors":["lizard","paper"], # "lizard":["spock","paper"], # "spock":["rock","scissors"]} options_list = list(options_map.keys()) options_text = "In one word, do you choose {0}, or {1}?".format(", ".join(options_list[:-1]),options_list[-1]) print("Time for " + " ".join(options_list) + ".\n\n") while True: print(options_text) print("Say 'quit' to stop playing.") user_choice = input("&gt; ").lower().split()[0] if user_choice == "quit": break if user_choice not in options_list: print("Try following the directions, spelling properly, and only typing one word.") continue comp_choice = random.choice(options_list) if user_choice == comp_choice: print("Tie game, you both chose " + user_choice + ".\n") continue if comp_choice in options_map[user_choice]: print("{0} beats {1}, you win.\n".format(user_choice, comp_choice)) continue print("{0} beats {1}, you lose.\n".format(comp_choice, user_choice)) I liked that it could be expanded for something even more ridiculous than rock, papers, scissors, lizard, spock.
I don't know what I'd be missing that you're not giving me, but okay. They seem to not follow the standard correctly, unless you're doing something wrong that I can't tell (because there are a wide variety of OAuth flows)
Sure and all answers are either libraries, Quora posts from before MyPy was a thing or answers saying that it is "Youtube".
Nice. I didn't even know triple-quoted strings were a thing, had to go test it out for myself. Very cool. Thanks for the advice.
Occasionally, when the gained clarity feels worth the lost clarity, especially when possible parameter types get weird or I need certain dictionary structures. I stubbornly only use them [obiwan](https://github.com/williame/obiwan) style. 
Because both of them are very trendy. (I love python, but let's be real here.)
yes, i know but neovim suffers from the same issues regarding asynchronous programming.
i couldnt find a neovim irc client plugin to use as object of rethoric to argue about though.
Oops, you have learned forty minutes ago what is VS Code about and you are ready to give advice on that topic? Impressive.
You did, you cut the text on the link but the href for the link itself still has all your information (right click, copy link), so edit that part out too Just to further convince you, your nonce starts with 0d3157
It depends on what you mean by large scale. My company is primarily Python-based. We don't have millions of clients as we are a mostly business-to-business oriented service. Our codebase is a pretty large Flask/Vue.js hybrid however. If you need examples, I'd recommend searching through Github a good bit for prominent organizations with Python clients of various projects. Luigi, from Spotify, comes to mind. 
Off the top of my head: Static analysis (especially useful with the typing module), pep violations hinter, method extractor, variable refactor, constant extractor, signature refactor, code generator (ex. Overrides for functions, dunder methods) integrated debugger (Inc asyncio), new feature hints (ie when you could be using fstring instead of format). Tooling is critical when it comes to efficiency

What is the subject of your masters thesis when you don't know much about python?
ps. i even tried to do something like that "products.css('.prod-name').xpath('@style').extract()",but im still getting the same results...
What? No they’re not. ML is a subset of AI [ML Wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) 
**Machine learning** Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence in the field of computer science that often uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to "learn" (i.e., progressively improve performance on a specific task) with data, without being explicitly programmed. The name machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel. Evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence, machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data – such algorithms overcome following strictly static program instructions by making data-driven predictions or decisions, through building a model from sample inputs. Machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where designing and programming explicit algorithms with good performance is difficult or infeasible; example applications include email filtering, detection of network intruders or malicious insiders working towards a data breach, optical character recognition (OCR), learning to rank, and computer vision. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Based on my experience with similar products, yes.
VS Code is much closer to atom. Visual Studio Community edition is Visual Studio with many things ripped out.
They’re really unrelated. AI is essentially the study of algorithms that use heuristics to solve problems quickly, ML is essentially function approximation. They’re totally different but people often equate them. Don’t believe Wikipedia for everything. 
I don't have a title yet but it will probably be about automating software testing. So I do know the basic syntax and some scripting in Python but not the intricacies. Apart of the data scientists I heard a lot of people frown on Python when the talk came to larger projects because of the dynamic typing. I figured though that this may not be a problem anymore (I guess?^^)
It’d help us to identify the problem if we could see all of your code. Could you provide us with a link to a github repo or some other place where we could look at the code?
Thank you very much. I have never heard of Luigi. I will have a look at it.
im writing "scrapy shell and the url" then im just writing "response" to just check the response and then im testing the response.css('.prod-name::text').extract() to just see the result before to build my script.
If it was just wikipedia, I wouldn’t have bothered: [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2016/12/06/what-is-the-difference-between-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning/#7af471d22742) [Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-main-differences-between-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-Is-machine-learning-a-part-of-artificial-intelligence) [Nvidia](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2016/07/29/whats-difference-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-deep-learning-ai/) [techopedia?](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/8181/machine-learning) 
I agree. But if they actually read shit before they clicked, most of their problems would have been solved in the documentation ;-)
They're only related thematically. In practice they're approached by programmers in completely different ways. In standard AI (the one you would use things like lisp for) the programmer already knows the rules and how the AI should behave in certain situations. You as a programmer will define the logic of the program in a way that it achieves whatever goals the AI has. ML is data driven, you as the programmer only setup the structure of the network and then feed it a bunch of training data. The program itself will create the logic internally that will fit the data.
From the error message I do not think this is a python error. I would check your networking. &gt; Retrying (Retry(total=1, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None, status=None)) after connection broken by 'ProtocolError('Connection aborted.', ConnectionResetError(104, 'Connection reset by peer'))': /simple/update-checker/ 
The pip 10 problem will give an error something like "Can't find __main__". 
Oh my bad, didn’t thoroughly read the post before I commented. What does ‘response’ look like?
what do you mean?
Thanks, so useful cheatsheet =)
This so much. I've got a pice of scientific software that I wrote in python. For my career I figured it would be nice to learn a few other languages and I find out easier to learn by doing. Every time I try Rust or Go I find my self getting so hung up on how (relatively) difficult basic array operations are. I'm just so used to the ease of numpy
Instagram is built on Python.
No love for CFFI?
First of all: sometimes they cannot work together. :) But, in order to understand when they can, you need to know a little bit about how programs can run, in principle, and how they can interact in principle, then you can see why would some times it work for Python and C. So, you probably know that somewhere on the very low level all programs are machine code. But, machine code isn't just an unstructured sequence of machine instructions. Most modern languages produce programs that are a collection of multiple interacting units. The operating system programs know how to stitch these units together because of how this machine code is packages. If you wanted to know the gory details, you'd find that programs have many different sections, where they store different kinds of information about them: perhaps code, perhaps some static data, perhaps names and addresses of procedures available in the program. Relevant to your question: programs store names and addresses (numerical values for the offset into program's code) of the code associated with the procedure. Operating system "knows" how to read the structure of the program, and how to invoke a procedure stored in your program. But, for example, the way procedures expect the memory to be laid out in order to read their arguments differs between operating systems and the executable formats they "know". This is, in part, why you cannot run a C program compiled for Linux on Windows and the other way around: Linux and Windows have different formats for programs, different calling conventions, different system calls etc. Of course this is a problem for people who want to write in different languages but still want their programs to communicate. This is why these interfaces are standardized, and this is why many different language implementations provide an implementation of the common protocol. In case of UNIX this could be CFFI (C foreign function interface). CPython being itself a C program both uses and exposes to its users its API using CFFI. When CPython interpreter executes Python code, it first byte-compiles it, which translates the Python code (with possible, but very minimal optimizations) into so-called op-codes (a very minimal language of the interpreter). These op-codes are implemented in C as function calls. This is one way to interface with Python: by providing it byte-code sequence or by directly calling the op-code implenetations. If you wanted to write a program that compiles into Python you might want to consider this path. Another way to interface with CPython interpreter is to use its C API. Since a lot of standard library in Python is implemented in C, you can often times skip the op-code to C translation part and call the C implementation directly. This will also give some speed-up. But, you will have to be mindful of CPython memory management, exception handling etc. Cython is a source-to-source compiler that is capable of translating Python code into C code that calls directly into interpreter. Yet another way is to use any IPC (inter-process communication) technology: sometimes language implementations are too different and they don't have any common interface. In this case, they both can exploit some IPC technology, like, for example, sharing memory between processes and writing into it in a specific pre-determined format. Or using something like HTTP server-client communication.
R is a complete language, a scripting language nonetheless, but complete. Exactly as Python, nothing more, nothing less.
To my knowledge scrapy shell provides a few objects, one of which being the `response` object "containing the last fetched page" (per the Scrapy docs). So, after you run `scrapy shell {{ some url }}` , type `response`, and hit Enter, what happens? What does the `response` object look like? Also I sent you a message so we don't blow up this comment thread.
I'm working on a system model for the company that I'm interning for (never programmed in python before - or anything except for MATLAB for that matter) and mainly manipulating data pulled from data warehouses and using Simpy to calculate future states of the factory. I'm struggling but I'm having a really fun time learning everything, especially when it comes to moving the information into Spotfire to present to coworkers. People where I work are really enthusiastic about it and appreciate what I'm doing, a great learning experience!
Is this the first cs50 course that's not in C?
If you want the truth, though this is probably going to start a flame, it is just because companies poured tenths of millions $ investment in it: scipy, numpy, TensorFlow, pytorch, etc. Really, this is the only reason. Python is no better in these things than any other language, actually there are languages that are much better at numerical computing and concurrency, for example: Fortran, C, C++, and people are going to kill me about this one: Clojure. But now because of the above reason it is clear that you have to know Python for doing machine learning, nobody could say the contrary.
If you don’t have any personal experience or have never used it before, better not to comment than risk sounding like an idiot... I prefer visual studio code over Atom and Sublime. Intellisense with Python feels good as well as the customizations and overall feel. There are some shortcuts that I miss from Atom, but I’m sure you could import it with a plug-in.

Completeness means nothing. Brainfuck is Turing-complete. Different languages have clearly been designed for different things, and some have had other functionality added later which doesn't necessarily fit with the core design. Python is, by design, a multi-purpose language. R is, by design, a statistics package. A great one, to be sure.
Nope - this is the follow up - click the link it gives you all the details. &gt; This course picks up where CS50 leaves off, diving more deeply into the design and implementation of web apps with Python, JavaScript, and SQL using frameworks like Flask, Django, and Bootstrap.
Yeah, my mistake, I *am* an idiot. I did not read the post carefully. At a glance I thought it was VS Community vs. PyCharm Community.

Can we sticky this ? Alternately, let's just give up, give /r/python to learnpython and move to /r/pythondev or something.
Well... maybe it simply doesn't have a 32 bit version of Python bindings for the library? I'm assuming that you made sure that the library itself is loadable by the OS. I'm not familiar with the library, but if it is distributed as a binary wheel, then it could be the case that there just isn't a 32 bit version. Perhaps try downloading the sources for the library and building it yourself?
I attribute Python's popularity in numeric computing to it's superb operator overloading and meta programming facilities. This makes it possible in Python to craft APIs with unique syntactic structures, which in turn makes it possible to express solutions to problems in a way natural to the domain. This is why, for example, Numpy can give us awesome numeric syntax, and Pandas can give us great relational syntax (and Python's base syntax is great for OOP). And when you're programming at such a high level, expressiveness is more important than performance. Even so, the interop with C puts Python in a great position to add expressive value to lower level, performance sensitive code. All of this together gives us a language with more expressive mathmatics than C or Java and more expressive engineering than MATLAB or R. It's quite literally the best of both worlds.
&gt; the programmer already knows the rules and how the AI should behave in certain situations. You as a programmer will define the logic of the program in a way Isn't that just... regular programming?
&gt;R is, by design, a statistics package Ehh... it's a general-purpose language that got adopted by statisticians and now has an excellent set of stats functions built in. There's nothing about R itself that makes it more suitable for stats than Python.
Maybe if you have a source. Right now its you vs Wikipedia
I will mark it as an announcement once the other secondary announcement becomes less relevant.
Separate your secret access keys from your code, so that you can distribute the code on the internet without worrying about the key. The simplest way to do this from an implementation point of view is by using Python's `os.environ` dictionary and passing it to Python as an [environmental variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable). Other ways to do it are to read from a file in a specified location or accept a command line flag.
Either your selector is wrong, or that part of the html is added with javascript. If the latter, look into selenium.
Well, should rather be using `python3 -m venv`.

&gt; Comparatively, AWS S3 is 320% more expensive to store and 400% more expensive to transfer to the internet. &gt; 75% cheaper Which is it? And what exactly do I gain / lose using Backblaze instead other than price, from your experience, if I may ask. Because regardless of the true percent it seems too good to be true.
RTFM? Are you mad?!!
I have been trying pycharm today and I disliked the UI theme. Tried to change it, failed, went back to Sublime. VSCode is nice but the lag on macOS is non-functioning for me...
You can do the math in either direction. For storage, B2 is $0.005/GB/mo whereas AWS is $0.021/GB/mo. That means AWS is actually 420&amp;#37; more expensive (0.021/0.005 - I got the 320&amp;#37; number from this website [https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage-pricing.html](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage-pricing.html)) and B2 is only 23&amp;#37; the cost of AWS, hence 75&amp;#37; cheaper (rounded). I don't work for Backblaze so I'm not harping them. Their main feature is cost reduction. They don't have regions so it may slow down transfers and obviously you'd be going in/out of your cloud. But if you are storing massive amounts of data that you are serving publicly, the transfer savings alone would be massive, which is why I have used them and recommend them.
Does it? I was under the impression that neovim had async out of the box.
Insert data into a queue, wait a few seconds and insert them back as a batch to the DB. If your DB is always behind and can't cope even with the batch inserted data then you probably should re-think your architecture/db choice. (sharding your tables, picking another db, bigger machines, there are tons of possibilities, we need more info :D)
PyCharm inspects the whole project, and it correctly identifies usage and definitions of classes on a project-tree (across all files).
That is a gross oversimplification. I've worked with R, Python, JavaScript, C, Perl, Bash, Scala, Java, and FORTRAN. In theory, anything I could do in one language, I could do in another. But in practice, each language had technical and non-technical tradeoffs. In the R vs. Python world, the tradeoffs mostly revolve around the communities and tool support. For instance, the R community has much better support for cutting-edge statistical libraries, while Python has better support for web development. Furthermore, R's syntax is much friendly for someone who comes from a Matlab/SAS background and Python is friendly if you come from a traditional computer science background. None of this is to say that R is good and Python is bad (or vice versa). They are very different languages with different communities, syntax, built-in libraries, and tooling. Saying R and Python or both scripting languages, nothing more, nothing less does neither of them justice. 
Statically typed languages make the visualization and manipulation a bit more challenging. Not that duck typing is better, but the lack of DataFrames and an interactive mode makes some of this challenging for data scientists. Maybe when the market matures more, but BLAS and LAPACK are still the fastest and f77 on the CPU side. While I like go, just using gonum for those same C wrappers for netlib code like BLAS and LAPACK doesn't have a lot of advantages when you give up the flexibility of interfacing with a a duck typed language with an interactive interface like python. Numpy/SciPy/Pandas are a hard combo to beat right now.
&gt; Alternately, let's just give up, give /r/python to learnpython and move to /r/pythondev or something. r/learnpython has more posts than r/python does, so I think we're fine keeping that name. :)
What are the other ways? Distributed systems come to my mind... 
You could use virtual environmants, that way you will have a proper python version and all the projects's dependancies you are working on available, without messing with your python2.
Have people benchmarked it, especially against other storage systems?
For programmers, I also find this table useful: [https://www.backblaze.com/b2/b2-transactions-price.html](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/b2-transactions-price.html) It breaks everything down to very exact numbers for each specific API transaction. But if you aren't a programmer, it is too much detail to think about. Amazon S3 has similar pricing tables you can compare to. Amazon's are a little more complex because they have different "tiers" of service like "One Zone-Infrequent Access". That make it difficult to figure out.
My best explanation/guess is that it's sorta similar to the reason someone might use a design pattern, class, function, etc. Even when doing so might cause a performance decrease. It's easier to work with a design pattern. It's more obvious to you and everyone else what you are doing and why. People can stop worrying about the specifics of some implementation and instead deal with an interface that handles it for you. Science, AI, ML, and math are really complex on their own. People who are working with that stuff want to make sure everything is as abstract as possible. Ideally you want to only be directly working with concepts and ideas relevant to your actual goal. Python is great for that. The language is elegant and incredibly obvious/readable. Working with another language means you have to give up some of that abstraction and have to start paying a lot more attention to the specifics of implementation and all the quirks that come with it. So people spend a lot of time creating libraries, wrappers, bindings, and all that sort of stuff to allow developers to focus on the work they need to perform, while not requiring them to sacrifice an unacceptable amount of performance. That's my understanding, at least. 
"**R** is a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) and [free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) software environment for [statistical computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_computing) and graphics that is supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing"
What would you suggest? I've already tried to disable the firewall, but the error keeps on...
maybe try ubuntu support channels?
You need to compare apples to apples. Amazon Glacier is a closer competitor to B2, than S3 is. Last time I checked, Glacier was cheaper in terms of storage costs.
I've moved to using VS code more mostly because I'm sick of the windows 95 look of notepad++.
How would you say it's similar to glacier? B2's files are always available. Glacier makes them available at a later time.
I'm looking on blackblaze's site and they claim no delay for retrieval. Glacier can take a few hours for bulk retrieval.
Thanks a lot for your response! I've been looking for an in... You don't recommend MOOC like Udemy or Coursera? It's better just to dive right into textbooks you think?
This problem comes up a lot in gamedev. It's solved by having a launcher that download updates when the application starts.
R is an implementation of S, a language from the 70s. But actually now I see that S stands for statistics and the famous formula notation was invented for S. So I retract my statement!

While long, this video by Raymond Hettinger will go over most of the Python options for Concurrency. In general, and on platform where fork() isn't much more expensive than thread like Linux using glibc() where the differences between fork() and pthreads is mostly preset options to clone() there are huge advantages to going with a threaded model under particular workloads. Threading tends to introduce locks, which has scaling issues with a large number of cores. It works for a small number of workers but hits amdahl's law before long. https://youtu.be/Bv25Dwe84g0
Trying for some self discipline by creating my own PyQt daily agenda app. Will bug the life out of me for overdue tasks, interface directly with other steps of repetitive tasks in a personal pipeline to GTD. Having a blast doing it
&gt; When installing the package in the Anaconda Prompt This is what you don't understand. The Anaconda Python interpreter and ArcGis one are completely separate. You'll need to install `spyder-kernels` in your ArcGis interpreter so you can use Spyder with it. I don't use ArcGis so I don't how to help you with that, but the easiest thing to do is to run `import spyder_kernels` and get no error **in ArcGis**. &gt; Will I have to redownload anything or will Spyder update automatically? Spyder will let you know when a new version is available. All you need to do is run `conda update spyder` in a system terminal. &gt; Finally, is there a way to change bit type of Spyder on the fly, or do I need the proper installation (OS is 64 bit, trying to check bit type of ArcGIS and having issues with that now as well). I don't understand very well what you mean by this. All I know is that you can install 32 bits apps in a 64 bits OS, but not the other way around.
`wtforms` uses this flow, check it out if you need some ideas.
Fair enough. I was thinking of these in terms of long term storage (i.e backups) use cases, in which case Glacier still seems to be a better bargain. But I'm pleasantly surprised to see that B2 can be cheaper than S3 for frequent access use cases. Well done.

Scipy and numpy were probably a huge draw, but please feel free to produce BLAS/LAPACK implementation in Clojure that outperforms the Fortran that every non GPU language you mentioned uses when performance matters. Clojure solutions seem t just use http://jblas.org/ which is a wrapper around the same code, or like in the case of neanderthal, import the Intel native MKL port using the same C api. Here is an example of the Fortran called for a LU: http://www.netlib.org/lapack/explore-html/d3/d6a/dgetrf_8f_source.html While there are variants and non-portable implementations (e.g. MKL) even Mainframes like z/OS use the netlib code. https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.1.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r1.cbcpx01/atlaslibraries.htm While I have no doubt that Clojure has serious advantages for some use cases, when it comes to linear algebra is just using the same code everyone else is.
Hi, can you please explain the sneaky magic bitmath condition here? You can assume I understand how decimal numbers translate to binary, how bit shifting and bitwise and, or etc operations work, and that all integers other than 0 evaluate to true.
Disclaimer: I work at Backblaze so I'm biased and you should be skeptical of anything I say. :-) Amazon Glacier has odd, hidden pricing that I claim makes it more expensive than Backblaze. Amazon's marketing department figured out that people fixate on the "cost per GByte per month to store", so they lowered that, and massively MASSIVELY overcharge for everything else. Calculate how much it costs to store 1 TByte in Glacier for 2 years and then RETRIEVE IT ONCE, and compare to the same 1 TByte scenario with Backblaze B2. The retrieval from Amazon will cost so much that it will wipe out the savings and then some. Here is a random article saying Glacier was 185 times as expensive as the guy originally estimated due to hidden fees: [https://medium.com/@karppinen/how-i-ended-up-paying-150-for-a-single-60gb-download-from-amazon-glacier-6cb77b288c3e](https://medium.com/@karppinen/how-i-ended-up-paying-150-for-a-single-60gb-download-from-amazon-glacier-6cb77b288c3e) I cannot vouch for any of the info in that article, I just found it with a random Google search. But if you Google the ideas found in it, you will see Glacier is not as cheap as Amazon claims.
I think we need r/learnlearnpython to post items about how to use r/learnpython, but then we change r/learnpython to just be reminders of what goes in r/python, which, meanwhile, will actually just be about snakes.
it doesnt work...
If you only use one thread, most reports we hear are that Backblaze B2 storage is a tiny bit slower than Amazon S3. Let's say B2 is maybe 90% as fast. Honestly we don't know why or what they are doing better. As long as you use more threads, there are literally no limits to the performance to B2. Because the B2 storage architecture which doesn't have any choke points like Amazon S3 has, with B2 each thread could be talking DIRECTLY to a totally different storage server than the other threads. So 1,000 threads is 1,000 times as fast as 1 thread. There are certain limits of course, but we are perfectly willing to work with you to make sure you don't ever see us be the bottleneck. An example limit is that we use 10 Gbit/sec network ports on most of our "cache" machines (that serve up content for public buckets), and depending on the situation there might as few as 6 or 7 of these "cache servers" serving up the identical content. If there are only 6 "cache servers" deployed in front of your content, then you could not exceed 60 Gbits/sec outbound bandwidth. Now, normally load grows at "some reasonable pace" and therefore as our "cache servers" get loaded more and more, we deploy more of them to handle the load. But if the load grew very suddenly (like jumped by 60 Gbits/sec in less than 24 hours) we might have to hustle to get more warm spares into the rotation.
Glacier is perfect for write once read never. Anything else and it doesn't make sense.
Right, so basically I'm treating`magic` as a 2D array of bits that represent outcomes for a given matchup. In one dimension, you have the player's input, and in the other dimension, you have the ai's input. Since there are 5 inputs in each dimension, there are 25 bits in total. To access a particular bit, you would bitshift over by the size of a row (5) multiplied by the vertical axis input (`user`), and then add the horizontal offset for the ai input (`ai`). Finally, you have to bitmask it with 1 (`&amp;1`), since you don't want the other bits to interfere with the if test.

I had the same experience getting a very nice working setup after adding minimal extensions. This was after I was trying to figure out how to copy all my Atom customizations from personal laptop to work laptop. I ended up trying out vscode, opening up a project folder, installing 1-2 things (they may have even been recommended after opening a .py file). That plus atom dark pro or something style, and I was good to go. Git integration was easy. The command pallette (name? cmd-shift-p) is super easy. Defaults for jumping to definitions (f12) and back to previous spot (ctrl--) are exactly what I was looking for.

Yep the perfect use case is for data that you hope you never have to recover. But data that you are willing to pay a lot to get back if the worst scenario does happen.
Developers complaining about people not RTFMing. \*laughs in sysadmin\*
From what I can see wtforms uses a single argument (a dict) for hooks. So it is \_very\_ close. Similarly the \`requests\` module has a hooks parameter that does a similar flow. The idea behind this class is to turn multiple hooks into a bit more of a re-usable set. cleanup = ChainMethod(lowercase\_all\_keys, remove\_duplicates) cleanup(myData)
Technically true, but the ai that was popular in the days of lisp is essentially unrelated to neural networks which is what people in this thread are mostly talking about.
It's a clip from a class using python and deep learning, but this was a highlight on how to use proper editors to learn and work with new libraries 
Trying out how plotly works as a replacement for matplotlib. Playing around visualising some stock market behaviour. So far Plotly looks pretty damn solid!
I use both, really. I prefer using Pycharm for bigger projects that deal with big libraries and such. But when I'm writing a one-off script that I just want to write it fast, I open VSCode. Okay, I open Sublime Text because the startup time is a lot faster than VSCode for me :v I don't really see myself using VSCode for big projects, because for that I use Pycharm, and I don't see myself using it for one-off scripts, because my script isn't worthy enough to deserve all of VSCode's features.
It isn’t as big of a hinderance as you’d expect. You can write multithreaded code in cython or just use the multiprocessing module. 
So it’s a C library wrapped in python?
I'm glad that you like Podcast.\_\_init\_\_! This is actually from my other show, the Data Engineering Podcast (which should be available in Pocket Casts if you are so inclined). Thanks for listening and feel free to reach out with any questions/comments/suggestions!
Replace dll with generic term "binary" and it's applicable to Linux and macos too.
Most ML libraries are. In fact all of Python is written in C.
I haven't taken a MOOC to give you a proper perspective of what they would offer, but I find I learn best by just doing the coding and preferably trying to complete a project. Which means a MOOC may not offer much over a text book for learning the language. My favorite recommendation is Automate the Boring Stuff because it offers a lot of useful examples for even a causal user. You may find that a MOOC may be more useful for the specific data science portion of your learning.
Didn't think you were promoting them :). Currently host some stuff on an S3 bucket for one on-site service and at those prices it seemed too good to be true.
We would be happy to have contributions to [pyglet](https://bitbucket.org/pyglet/pyglet/wiki/Home). Our test suite is now using Pytest, but there is a lot of older unittest code as well. 
&gt;This is a temporary post due to the high influx of reports we have had on the matter of "this post belongs in /r/learnpython". maybe someone wrote a reporting bot
Unrelated question, does B2 have a feature equivalent of this? https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingHTTPPOST.html
Hmmm, ok I'm with you part of the way I think. So your magic number translates to the 25-digit (assuming a couple of leading zeroes) binary number: 0010110010010101000101100 Which you treat as a results array like so (using k for spock): ai r p s l k u r 0 0 1 0 1 s p 1 0 0 1 0 e s 0 1 0 1 0 r l 1 0 0 0 1 k 0 1 1 0 0 Then, for example, if the user inputs `'paper'`, `user` evaluates to `1`. If `ai` is `2`, then `magic` is right-shifted by 7 (`5*1+2`), resulting in the evaluating condition: 0000000001011001001010100 &amp; 0000000000000000000000001 = 0000000000000000000000000 = 0 (False) Hence, `"You Lose."`. Right?

That's outside what I normally do but I'll definitely take a look, thanks!
Numpy and Pandas are a big reason Python is what it is. Data scientists to call themselves "Numpy/Pandas programmers." Some still do to this day. I've talked to a lot of people who think Python is *only* for data science/ML. Naturally, Python's ML modules were built off of the Numpy and Pandas as the obvious tool for the task.
I'd actually use a generator for that also. ``` def fib(max): a, b = 0, 1 while a &lt; max: yield a a, b = b, a+b ```
Oh ok, looks like I have the array completely backwards in that case. Cool. Man, binary operations are pretty cool, well done. Do you work in low-level languages/use binary operations often, or did it just strike you as the sensible and quick way to solve this? My intuition for this problem, as someone who has only dabbled in binary but mostly prefers pythonism, was to assign the possible inputs as an `itertools.cycle` object, and then define a `result()` function according to the distance along the cycle from user choice to ai choice. So if we establish the matchup options as a directed C5 graph, it can be designed so that if it takes 2 or 3 moves to get from the user choice to the ai choice, user wins, but if it takes 1 or 4 moves, ai wins, if you get what I mean. But that would probably take a fair bit more mucking around than your design haha.

Everything that people seem to list as advantages of PyCharm can be included with a few clicks in VS Code and customized to your liking. I have not found a reason to use anything else yet. VS Code is very responsive, convenient, heavily customizable and doesn't lack anything that I need, so VS Code for me. The setup needed is cakewalk too, I don't understand why some people shun the fact that customizable editors need some setup. If you are literally writing software, adding some extensions and changing a few settings if needed is not anywhere near the levels of complexity you should be worried about. 
If you read about Backblaze they specialize in cheap storage since they provide unlimited backup space for a single computer for like $5. It’s pretty awesome and I agree, sounds impossible!
Those are all excellent points that I hadn't considered before. Thanks. Though I'm no familiar with f77 -- does that refer to Fortran 77?
Thanks for clarifying this one!
This is great intro info. Thanks a lot dude!
Ok cool. I'm going to look into the best textbooks that are out there and work on 1 or 2 chapters a week. Thanks for all the advice bro.
TensorFlow has you define computational graphs in Python and when it actually executes it uses a c++ later underneath to do the actual computation.
&gt;Man, binary operations are pretty cool, well done. Do you work in low-level languages/use binary operations often, or did it just strike you as the sensible and quick way to solve this? Well, I had a project that involved some binary parsing in C++ that was somewhat similar a while ago. I don't really think it's the most sensible way to solve it (would be a lot better to just use Python's lists), but it did occur to me. I'm actually putting a talk together on this sort of bitmath black magic fuckery for next month's Duluth .NET user meetup, which is why it was on my mind. &gt;My intuition for this problem, as someone who has only dabbled in binary but mostly prefers pythonism, was to assign the possible inputs as an itertools.cycle object, and then define a result() function according to the distance along the cycle from user choice to ai choice. So if we establish the matchup options as a directed C5 graph, it can be designed so that if it takes 2 or 3 moves to get from the user choice to the ai choice, user wins, but if it takes 1 or 4 moves, ai wins, if you get what I mean. I suppose that could work. I know another way to conceptualize my solution is that the 2D array represents a connection matrix for the graph you're thinking of. Something you always have to think about is the tradeoff between CPU usage and memory usage (precomutation), and I think memory usage wins out over computing the results here, especially when you can compact the whole table into a single `int`.
Is it possible that pip or apt-get installs 64 bit version instead of 32 bit, if 32 bit binaries are not available? On Windows this was fixed easily by copying needed dll in to project folder, where glfw was able to find it.

No, I browse by /new a lot, there's been a *shitload* of basic questions recently. Even stuff like "why should I learn python instead of other languages?" Who knows why, maybe /r/summerreddit has something to do with it.

Not helpful 
I've done this. You write an algorithm in Python: its easy to develop (no segfaults), easy to read some data into it (scikit learn or another packages already reads the common formats in your field), and easy to make plots to put in your paper. Then, oops, it is state of the art per iteration, but takes ages in practice, so you replace the core with cython or C or Rust and now its reasonable speed. If the algorithm is important enough (haven't done this) then some commercial behemoth will find itself coming up against limitations are rewrite as a nice python wrapper around compiled code designed for speed and scalability, like almost all common (speed sensitive) python libraries are. So: python having the libraries makes it (or R, for that matter) the right place to state playing with ideas (whether you are implementing the algorithm or just trying out an existing one on your data). Just be clear though: Python is not an implementation language for competitive algorithms, it is an integration language. YMMV, but...
It is pretty simple you can hack together an app pretty quickly. Since ML is a developing technology this provides the capability to experiment and paly with ML on a variety of platforms.
If you are at all curious about B2, please try it out! It is completely free to create a Backblaze account. The first 10 GBytes are free (you do not need to give Backblaze a credit card so there is no possible way we can charge you while you evaluate the B2 product). Using the (kind of friendly) web interface you can create a bucket, make sure that bucket is “public”, drag and drop some pictures of cute cats to upload them to your bucket. Then you can forward a “friendly URL” to your friends that they can click on to view the cat pictures. All for free. See if there is any delay to serve up the cat pictures! 
What's really the problem though? The cream rises to the top anyway and will get more attention and contributions? If multiple options rise to the top, chances are they might offer features that are subject to preference and trying to smash them all together into one sounds like it could be a lot messier than where you start off from.
Python documentation is written for serious programmers. Most people using python are not serious programmers. It's quite difficult for most people reading it. "The fuck?!" is the phrase I use most when reading official docs.
Thank you for introducing me to B2, it looks really, really good! I'm going to give them a go for a few months then hopefully bye-bye Amazon. I'll make sure to use your library, too!
Scipy has historically been mostly developed by graduate students. Numpy was not funded until very recently, and also had very little in the way of corporate funding. TF and PT both have 800lb gorilla corporate backers.
Yes but I guess I am out of date, it move to Fortran 90 in 2008. https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack-release
&gt;Something you always have to think about is the tradeoff between CPU usage and memory usage (precomutation), and I think memory usage wins out over computing the results here, especially when you can compact the whole table into a single `int`. Absolutely. The docs for `itertools.cycle` actually specifically warn about possible memory overhead blow outs too haha. I'm sure your binary magic would probably be close to the most efficient solution possible. It's really neat, thanks for sharing and elaborating. Good luck with your talk btw :)
There's a subreddit for /r/learnpython for this sort of thing. Generally, functions might ask for a source to be read or copied, and a target to be written. Sometimes they use the word "destination" instead of target. For example, fahrenheit = celsius * 9. / 5. + 32. In this case, the variable `celsius` is a source variable which the computer will read and carry out calculations, while the name `fahrenheit` is a target which will be written and capture the result of the calculation. In another example, import shutil shutil.copyfile('readme.txt', 'readme-backup.txt') This function takes a source filename, and a destination filename. The data in `readme.txt` will be read and reproduced into a new file `readme-backup.txt`.
It's what I do and it works for me. YMMV. I did use codeschool once for AngularJS and it was helpful. acloudguru was indispensible-- I don't think I could learn as much as I did from a book about the AWS platform. But Java, PHP, HAProxy, MySQL, API design, Python 3-- all books &amp; googling.
The extensibility is important in the way it's available in Python. Many scripting languages are "extensible" in that they can run executables and capture STDOUT or use some IPC mechanism. In Python shared libraries can be loaded directly into the memory space of the Python interpreter and and their functionality called directly from Python. So numpy generating some huge array doesn't need to serialize it or pass it over an IPC mechanism, Python is just given a pointer to it. So access is fast and direct. The module itself (numpy lets say) can have functions that are pure Python or just call functions from the shared library. Using the module you rarely have to care. 
Ohhhh okay! Bye!

You can simply check the version :) Go to the `site-packages` in the virtual environment, find the library you are installing. In its directory there should be an `*.so` file. Run: file *.so on it. It will tell you something like: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, ...
No one is actually answering your question about *how* these languages talk to each other. It's all about calling convention. Programming languages need to define how information flows between functions. How do variables "go" from one function to another? When data is returned where should we look for it? Calling convention gives rules for exactly how memory moves through the computer when you execute functions. In a computer you have a bunch of memory and we access it as if it is one giant array from 0 to 4 billion (or however much ram you have). At the bottom of the memory we store the code. When your program gets compiled the 1s and 0s end up here. Further up is the "stack". When your program runs it needs to keep track of things like: what is the value of this variable? What function am I in? This is stored on the stack. At the top is the heap. Memory that is allocated at runtime (dynamically allocated) goes here. Example, say you're a baker and there's a complex recipe in a book. You refer to the book (code) for instructions (your program). There are a lot of steps so to help you keep track of what you've done and what you're currently doing you're using a clipboard (stack). The heap isn't important to calling convention. The stack is split up into "stack frames". Each function has a stack frame which is the "clipboard" for that function. The function always expects it's arguments in very specific parts of the clipboard. It always puts it's return value into a very specific part of the clipboard. When a function is called there is a new stack frame created at the current location in the stack. Effectively, a stack frame inside a stack frame. Continuing our example, our recipe is so complicated that some instructions will contain additional instructions within. One instruction says "mix the ingredients" but really there are many instructions within that. Mix the flour and eggs first. Slowly add milk. Etc. You have one clipboard for mixing the ingredients and when you get to the instruction to mix flour and eggs you go get another clipboard just for that step. You also mark on the first one that you had to go get another one for the flour and eggs part. The caller function knows exactly how to set up the callee function's stack frame because of calling convention. The cool thing is that compiled languages usually use the same calling convention so you can execute C code from Rust if you wanted to because at the end of the day the "code" portion of memory isn't C, Rust, or Fortran, it's x86. Calling convention can be complicated but essentially the callee function puts the data into memory on top of the stack, then starts executing the new function. Putting those arguments onto the stack was the beginning of our new stack frame. When the function returns it puts that return data somewhere (I forget where specifically) and then it deletes it's own stack frame. That's like if you finished your mixing step and then smashed your clipboard. What does this have to do with Python? Python knows the calling convention for C++. When Python uses C code it is abiding by calling convention to execute it.
Thank you! I’m flattered!
Subject to preferences? What are these preferences you are talking about? It seems to me, having a solid solution that anyone would actually benefit everyone. &gt; The cream rises to the top anyway and will get more attention and contributions? How can you have something that rises to the top if everyone starts their own project (to suit their preferences as you say). If anything, history the very fact we have so many projects show us what you suggest just doesn't happen (these aren't new projects).
What os?
I don't want to troll, just wondering, that if large number of people thinks that their post belongs to subreddit X, where they are constantly reminded to post it to subreddit Y, isn't there some deeper problem, for example that subreddit Y doesn't have a good name, or something else? I don't know about any other subreddit, where people would constantly drive others away to another subreddit. It feels to me this forwarding isn't solving the underlying problem. Maybe those people don't want to "learn" python, but just need help with some specific problem? What if /r/python would be for any request for python help, and those who want to discuss the language would create other subreddit, like /r/discusspython etc.?
I'll try to take a stab at (3) and (4), but I'm not familiar with your circumstances, so I might be wrong. Debugging (step debugging specifically) allows you to examine the state of the program as you run it. It allows you to know what were the values of the variables at the time the function was called, in what sequence the functions were called, what were the values of the variables in the function before the one that was called and so on. You would use debugger to verify that your assumptions about your code hold. Restarting the kernel sounds like an overkill really. This also sounds like you might be doing this on Linux, since MS Windows users aren't typically aware of their system having a kernel. So, I'll assume you are using Linux. So, if you aren't using any sort of graphical environment / multi-session mode, where you could simply switch to a different session / start a new terminal and then find the stuck process using: pgrep $name-of-your-program Or, perhaps: ps aux | grep $things-that-might-be-in-command-invoking-the-program This would give you the process id of the program you want to stop. Then, you can: kill $process-id-of-offending-program Sometimes the program misbehaves to the point it will not exit when you send it `SIGTERM` (which is the one sent by `kill` by default), then you can: kill -9 $process-id-of-offending-program Which will send `SIGKILL` - a signal the program cannot ignore (unless in very specific circumstances, like waiting on system call to return). So, if you are in a single-session mode with, basically, a single terminal to work on your Linux station, you could still try Ctrl-Z, which will put the current process interacting with user into background and bring back the shell that started it. Typically it will also print something about the process id of the backgrounded process. You can then kill it using `kill` as described above.
Thanks, fam. :)
I would argue that this is not a distinction that makes sense. Any variable in Python can be made a target of an assignment and be a source of an assignment. So, if you were to answer a question: "is x a source variable or a target variable?", you'd not be able to give a correct answer because whenever x is a variable it is also a source and a target. Perhaps, in some context, this distinction might make sense, but I'm really struggling to imagine one. If you are learning about Python, and this is how it is being taught, I'd consider looking for another course (there are literally dozens of them, taught by very good colleges), and, at least, comparing notes. This particular one you might be in doesn't sound very inspiring.
To add to this just a little to the many great responses here already (especially /u/etrnloptimist ). Say you have the following script: `test.py` a = 1 a += 1 print(a) When (c)python executes that script it first compiles it to bytecodes which are instructions for the cpython virtual machine. To see the bytecodes in an easy to understand way do this: `python3 -m dis test.py` 1 0 LOAD_CONST 0 (1) 3 STORE_NAME 0 (a) 2 6 LOAD_NAME 0 (a) 9 LOAD_CONST 0 (1) 12 INPLACE_ADD 13 STORE_NAME 0 (a) 3 16 LOAD_NAME 1 (print) 19 LOAD_NAME 0 (a) 22 CALL_FUNCTION 1 (1 positional, 0 keyword pair) 25 POP_TOP 26 LOAD_CONST 1 (None) 29 RETURN_VALUE What that output basically says is that the script itself is compiled to bytecodes `LOAD_CONST`, `STORE_NAME`, `LOAD_NAME` etc. When cpython executes this code it basically just does a big switch statement taking care of each bytecode. E.g. it takes care of `LOAD_CONST` here https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/ceval.c#L1067-L1072 and it takes care of `STORE_NAME` here https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/ceval.c#L2002-L2021 . So if you were to trace through the bytecodes above and basically just pull out the C code in order you would more or less have a C program that does the same thing as the python program. I say "more or less" because you would have to initialize the interpreter correctly and you would have to set up the data parts of the script correctly and probably a million more little details that would be hard to get right. But philosophically unwinding the code this way should work. Now finally if you want to know how foreign C code could be called it happens in a few places. Basically you would have to have binary code compiled to match cpython's binary interface (basically you need a module that declares the right things) and then you need that C code to call your function. To get python to know anything about it in the first place, you need an `import` statement somewhere earlier which will import your binary code by dynamically importing the code (say `dlopen` in Linux, something else on other platforms) and call intialization routines in the code. Those routines say "hey this is a function I want you to call and give it this name". Then when you later do something like `call_binary_function()` in python, it will go through it's calling procedure and find that it is a binary function and then call that code directly. Without blabbering out forever, this is the jist of it. It's simultaneously very simple and mind-bogglingly complicated. I have three writeups I went through that go into more detail here: https://thomasnyberg.com/what_are_extension_modules.html https://thomasnyberg.com/releasing_the_gil.html https://thomasnyberg.com/cpp_extension_modules.html Those maybe be helpful if you're curious.
Please repost this in September when school starts back up.
I guess there was an issue with pocketcasts when I searched data engineering podcast yesterday, now it works. Keep up the good work. 
If you are interested in genealogy have a look at the Gramps project &gt; https://github.com/gramps-project/gramps The little badge shows they are up to 42% test coverage if I'm reading it correctly (non programmer, just a user of the program) &gt; https://codecov.io/github/gramps-project/gramps?branch=master
This is what I always say to people - programming in just python? pycharm. Using more than one language? vscode.
Out of curiosity, why didn’t you just use B2’s python library?
&gt; Really, this is the only reason. Python is no better in these things than any other language, actually there are languages that are much better at numerical computing and concurrency, for example: Fortran, C, C++, and people are going to kill me about this one: Clojure. Only if you count speed/efficiency of the computation, and not the implementation. I am a fairly competent at both Python and C++, and I would never, ever, ever, prototype things in C++ unless it can be avoided. Python's power in this context is in the REPL (or the Jupyter notebook) since I can develop code and plot results in iterations that are much, much, faster than what I can do in C++.
