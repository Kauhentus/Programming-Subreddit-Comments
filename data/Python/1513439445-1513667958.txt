That function checks if any value will evaluate to NaN. The stupidity comes from something like this: &gt; var x = NaN &gt; x == NaN false &gt; x === NaN false x != x true
Have you checked to see if your use-case is doable via their API? That'd be my first stop before endeavoring down this road.
The one thing that made me actually stand up and walk away from my desk is the first time I tried to call sort() on a native array of numbers without a callback function. 
Can u elaborate? I am new to this stuff and hence don't know much.
So I need to read the FAQ about why a demo on their own website doesnt work?
Go also has some promise here
or better yet, Python
they're kind of already doing what you'd like to be doing but with WebAssembly
LLVM IR has been powering emscripten and rust's compilation to ASM.js then WASM for years.
there seems to be a way to this. if the link u scrapped contains a value docid. Can you share the link which u scrapped ? 
Is NaN a singleton? I thought it was just another float value.
I really want to go , but I don't live in Lahore (but am in Pakistan) and I have my med school orientation and classes start as well... Maybe someday PyCon will happen in Isb and I will defo go then.

Is it possible to have the bot use a youtube vid converter to then send mp3 and mp4 files?
Actually I can't as it belongs to my friend. I can't share without his permission.
Great to see such initiatives in Pakistan :) 
There are 2 ways to find the docid. 1.right click on the streaming video and select the option copy debug info you will get the docid. 2.get the id from the video src link. Have a look at this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18479155/google-drive-video-streaming
Can you tell me more about the unlimited WhatsApp plan? :D
Ignore the haters. If someone makes performant web apps with Python as the client side language, and makes the tools open and easy to use, Pythonistas will flock to it.
I use a fucking azerty keyboard, can’t even touch type (, )
Yeah, you could do just about anything, you'll probably need to make a script that works on it's own and just integrate it when a valid command is called (e.g. /convert {song_name})
For sure, I use Chatsim (https://www.chatsim.com/). It's $44 for the whole year and no matter what country I visit, I have unlimited WhatsApp. I use to rely on other people googling things for me but this bot solves it :)
Don't forget that NaN is a number
That's what he said
No. You need to realize that *the demo actually works*, and then read the FAQ to understand why there are 404s in the console.
I second this. It's a fantastic book that really helped me understand the internals of python.
Looks like you have too much white space at the beginning of that line. It should line up with IF. 
Indents are important in python. Your `elif` is *inside* the `if` statement, but should be on the same level.
These libraries are used for reading the files: - https://github.com/danielhrisca/asammdf - https://github.com/ratal/mdfreader - https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.io.loadmat.html
I don't think the Google account belongs to him, hence the API wouldn't work.
That's the problem. When I try to do that the new indentation isn't where the 'if' was. It is all the way on the side of the screen.
That's the problem. When I try to do that the new indentation isn't where the 'if' was. It is all the way on the side of the screen. I just didn't give the elif something to do because it doesn't work one way or another.
I don't know how to do that
I’m trying to make a circuit simulator program with a full user interface: I’m hoping to make it a standalone program eventually. I thought this would be a great project to solidify OOP and GUI concepts while building something actually useful to me.
I see your issue. Languages that do not have global variables, intentionally do so to prevent what you are doing. It can be difficult to get around. If you have multiple files that load and interact with data, then you just need to wrap all of those interactions into functions. Then you call the functions from a single file. This may require you to pass the data into your function calls. If you really want to mimic global variables, you may want to consider persisting the data to sqlite or something like that. Then you can treat the data as global variables
try the backspace key.
Try deleting them?
Check out /r/learnpython. The sub is chock full of resources for people in your exact position.
Its only one character. Like tab or something. Deleting it puts me all the way on the left.

Doesn't work. I go all the way to the left
And what happens when you delete it?
Probably because you're using the interpreter, which offsets the first line visually because of the `&gt;&gt;&gt;`. Hitting backspace fixes it, however: https://gyazo.com/4fa562ad060f0015c061714401385353

Stuff like this should be posted on /r/learnpython. 
Did my most recent comment clear up the issue? https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/7k83c1/can_someone_please_tell_me_what_im_doing_wrong_im/drc97cg/
I don't understand how group-think is related. If, at the time, VB was great or beloved or whatever, what is wrong with trying to get it more places? 
nice, I haven't seen 3to2. Does it support those things?
Maybe if you read the README, you'll see the rationale. The whole point is to **use** Python3.7 even if a system that I target needs Python2 instead of using Python2 in order to be compatible
I know. Doesn't mean I can't still disagree with it.
Yeah, this is true. There's much less need to optimize one-time scripts, for the most part.
Thanks! I think that will work perfectly. 
I agree with this. The elif needs an argument

/r/learnpython 
This is easy with conda. But personally, I like virtualenv too. So I use conda to manage my “base” installs of 2.7 and 3.6 and then use virtualenv pointing to those executables. 
Given the "DOTA2" in your username.. your obviously tech/gaming aficionado to be the least. Still.. as a fellow Desi (from the other side).. stick to medical field. If you're smart enough to get in.. you can go to medical field and then work on your Python/programming passion in your spare time.. the best of both worlds. Who knows.. perhaps you might get an idea for a medical program which someone didn't think about it before.
No, in that case the raw data should be available on the Jupyter server as well as the notebook files, so you can load the same data into both notebook files.
Because your in an ide. That would work from a python script. But in the ide it allows you to write one line at a time and test it. And see how there is a ... before the print done means your ide still thinks it’s in the loop
Holy crap they got both Hettinger and Beazley?? That's awesome 
If I could change my Reddit username I would... I left my hardcore gaming side a long time ago. But yeah, you're right. I'm definitely going to spend most of my time studying for my degree. I appreciate your support, my mother doesn't seem to see the good in any thing tech related lol
Ok, thanks, didn’t know that sub existed!
First, /r/learnpython. Second, you need to post the entire error. Third, images of text *suck*. You need a blank line after the while loop. That's only a requirement in the interactive interpreter, it's not required when executing a file.
Cron
Any ways to do it in-script? My script is not suited to be only fired once.
Please use /r/learnpython in future. import operator users = sorted(db, key=operator.itemgetter("bal"))
You'll want to use the built in function [sorted()](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#sorted) along with a lambda function to extract the key you want. After that, you can just find the top values by referring to the first or last 3 positions in the list, depending on which way you sorted it.
Not a good idea. If something kills the process it won't restart itself. Cron, or Task Scheduler if using Windows. Also, what do you mean "script is not suited to be only fired once"?
Maybe investigate the `datetime` module? It's probably possible to get the number of seconds until a given date, which you can then pass to `time.sleep`.
If you need to persist some state, write it to a file, database or environment variable and read it again when the script is called next.
Typical desi parents.. My dad told me my future would consist of sweeping floors.. when I told him.. while failing classes in my first year of college.. that I didn't understand Engineering and that I wanted to switch to Computer Science. 15 years later.. he's the one living in my house. Mother was supportive of me all the way. She just wanted me to study what I liked.. as long as it was a good field.
Hint: read sidebars. They're there for a reason.
We Incorporated a library to read edf files so definitely not opposed to adding more functionality. In what domain are those files used in?
It's the other way around in my family. I got acceptance in Army Medical Rawalpindi but in the dentistry field, and my mother thought it wasn't enough, simply because when you go to the United States to practice, you need to study two more years, or something like that 
Don't quote me on the numpy mkl multithreading but I usually install via conda which by default uses Intel mkl but you can set it to use openblas. Not sure what the situation is via pip install.
Then cache what you need across runs in a file
i interpreted that to mean you wanted something typed that wasn't kotlin
You have to create a .py file. Use a text editor and then run it from command prompt

Automotive &amp; heavy equipment calibration. If it runs an internal combustion engine it's more than likely calibrated with CANape / .mdf files. - https://vector.com/vi_canape_en.html - https://vector.com/portal/medien/ecu_calibration/canape/CANape_Basics_WhitePaper_EN.pdf It's $$$$. An interactive plotting GUI would be invaluable. The .mat files are anything that uses Matlab / Simulink.
Maybe calculate a timedelta and sleep for timedelta.total_seconds() but i agree with others that using Cron should be a better solution.
Another simple way to do it is to wake up periodically and check the date and time to see if you should run. If not, loop and sleep again. It's not quite as efficient, but if you wake up every 30 seconds on an active desktop, you'll never notice any impact. Of course, it all depends on how important it is for this to run. Does it have to run exactly on the second? What if it misses? What if your programs gets killed or the computer turns off or goes into standby? For most purposes, cron or Task Scheduler are the right answer, and you would set up your script to be runnable this way.
Ask your mom what she wants. To have her son live a stable live in US or live in her house in Pakistan. I really hope you chose Army Medical Rawalpindi
This is one of those problems that, intuitively, seems simple but is in fact quite difficult and involved. Here is what you think you want: to have a given script wait until a specific date/time and then execute (possibly repeatedly). Here is the implication: you will have an entire Python interpreter, plus all of its resources and any resources held by scripts or modules imported by your script, sleeping and unresponsive. Any time you want to use Python while this script is resident, you will have to launch an entirely separate interpreter, with all that entails. So using Cron is probably the cleanest and simplest option after all.
Ok, just skip the part teaching them how to use the internet to make bombs so they can blow up infidels. Killing non Muslims is technically part of their religion there.
Maybe they could also add a seminar about not fucking your cousins, considering Pakistan is literally the most inbred country in the world
No it wouldn’t. Python is way too dynamic. 
No matter what your religious views are I think it's useful to leave them out of this sub. Most of the people in this sub are really nice and caring but then we have people like you who turn every good thing into political and/or religious. I sincerely hope you will tone down your future comments. Have a good day :)

I'll check it out, this seems pretty inefficient though, are there any better/faster ways to figure something like this out?
Yasser Bashir is doing a lot for promoting Python in Pakistan. I attending the first ever PyCon meetup at Arbisoft back in July. I [wrote an article](https://pythontips.com/2017/08/02/pycon-pakistan-the-first-meetup-in-lahore/) on that as well if you want to give it a read. Kinda sad that I won't be able to attend this PyCon because I am not in Pakistan right now. 
I'm trying to tease the western civilizations into a joint international crusade against the Muslim world. I don't agree that this is a good thing. It's a bad thing (The western word for Haram) to give technology and empowerment to an enemy that has sworn to eliminate western civilization. Nice Jihad of the pen though, very high quality.

Again, not the right approach for a legit piece of software but for a data analysis project, it seems pretty effective.

Sad irony: I can't read brython.info as it requires Javascript to view---which I have turned off.
I'm not talking about the process of importing it, but letting stuff from inside that module run (also "by itself", not only functions that are called by the base system).
Why don't you tell us some more about what you're trying to do and what constraints you have? How often do you want to run this program? For how long each time? Will it leave "breadcrumbs" that future runs of the program will see? What will they do if they see them? Until any of us know more about your situation, the best we can do is say 'cron'. (To be clear, so far any other suggestion is inferior. But depending on your situation, there may be a better one.)
is it possible to use 2 virtual environment ? 
There are plenty of historical and contemporary examples of people of differing faiths coexisting peacefully. Most of those ended because of people like you. There are plenty of historical examples of Crusades which aimed to eliminate some group of people or their ideologies from the face of the earth through violence. How many of those were successful? What was the price? You'll notice that most historians don't hold extreme views about how the world aught to be. I wonder why that is?

The documentation *does* explain what the return types are, at the beginning of that section under the heading "IMAP4 Objects". &gt; Each command returns a tuple: `(type, [data, ...])` where *type* is usually `'OK'` or `'NO'`, and data is either the text from the command response, or mandated results from the command. Each data is either a string, or a tuple. If a tuple, then the first part is the header of the response, and the second part contains the data (ie: ‘literal’ value). Note also, although it doesn't make any difference in this case, you should make sure you are using the Python 3 docs not the ones for version 2 which you linked to.
I'am sure you don't need the answer as literal as this but here you go. import operator db =[{"bal": 4536, "name": "objectone"}, {"bal": 347630, "name": "objecttwo"}, {"bal": 543, "name": "objectthree"}] users = sorted(db, key=operator.itemgetter("bal"), reverse=True) user_dict = {} for index, user in enumerate(users, 1): user_dict['user' + str(index)] = user for key, val in user_dict.items(): print(f'{key} = {val}')
This would print the character ‘I’, not the value of the variable
Hi, long time Spyder user here. Can you provide some insight on *why* Anaconda pulled funding for Spyder? I am personally moving away from Python in general, as my projects are becoming more complicated and speed-dependent, and especially because I am not sure if I want to deal with a future where Spyder isn't available as the ready "this makes sense" IDE for scientific Python. I I "grew up" on Spyder: a lot of the work at my first job, and the work for my first paper, used Spyder + Python...
Caveat, if you need to be precise or/and work with long time you need to understand how python (plus what you will interact with) actually handle time. Time zones, daylight saving time, leap days and seconds will bite anyone who work with time at some point.

It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community is actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers.

Look at my comment history. Just like you, I'm a real person with views about the state of the world based on my observation and reason. I have the benefit of not being raised to hate strangers. Do you think a person with the username "determinism" would promote islam or any other religion? As for your question, I can provide links but I am hesitant to believe that you are interested in them. I would prefer not to spend my Saturday afternoon justifying my views about whether or not we should "kill all the muslims... or something".

Ah, thank you. I must have missed it returning a tuple or string.
Yup. And it makes things like logging and clicking download a breeze. I've used qt4 to dowload js websites too but it's less effective
I'd rather see work toward WASM support in Python than a transpiler.
Hope mine doesn't, let's see how long it lasts :)
It brings me gratification that the muslims have to resort to virtue signaling rather than denial of any problem. Looks like the game is advancing. The people helping Pakistan, an enemy of america, are straying dangerously close to being a traitor. The penalty for those crimes are harsh, regardless of intent 
In what way was it shut? What was the ToS violation that they cited?
You're kind of asking me, “What is it that we don't know we don't know?” which is obviously a hard/impossible question to answer. :) But the existence of perturbations as described and linked above is a pretty surprising fact which shows that even networks with different architectures are all vulnerable to defeat by an adversary with surprisingly little adjustment to their inputs.
Where you using something like this (webdriver) or trying to connect directly through yowsup etc?
Possible? Probably. But that is not what I am doing. I use conda to install the python version (actually, I do the anaconda version to get all of the scientific stack and other stuff). I seem to recall having to install the virtualenv tool via conda as well since it is slightly different. Then, I do: $ virtualenv --python=/path/to/python2_or_python3 path/to/virtualenv Then I can use pip, etc to get and maintain that environment. Honestly, *just* using conda would be fine, but I like how virtualenv puts all of its folders where I want them. It feels more self contained.
It should possible to run this in Python shell, but the indent issue will be way easier to deal with using an IDE that has a built-in debugger. Early on, the debugger can be a huge help in troubleshooting some of the syntax issues that OP is working through. I like Spyder, personally, but everyone has their preferred flavor. Short of that, editing in text editor and running the file from DOS command line would still be an improvement. But, OP may already be using IDLE (from what I can decipher from the screen shot), so there's an [even easier way](https://youtu.be/kXbpB5_ywDw?t=6m22s) to run from a .py file. Hope this helps, /u/17paaf
Chapter 15 of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python covers this: http://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter15/ TL;DR: cron, or Scheduled Tasks.
Feel free to make a feature request on the repo with what you posted here. I'll look into adding that support, given there is a library already to read those files, that should make my life earlier
Raymond and Dave, nice!
&gt; i dont want an uncaught exception Then catch all exceptions.
right, yowsup. but nothing extreme. for example just an hourly cronjob to check for new app store reviews. just a warning not to test something like this with your everday phone number :-) when I have time I start something new with telegram now.
I agree that cron is the obvious solution, but I think you're overstating the overhead. The Python interpreter that I just opened is using 2.5MB of memory. If I open a thousand of those, I will start to worry about the overhead. Python's overhead might have been a problem 12 years ago when you only had 128MB of memory, but today it's just not a consideration that has any weight to it. The real reason you don't want to do this with a constantly running script is dependability. At 4pm tomorrow, I know cron is going to be working. But any number of problems could stop a running python script, and some of them are completely impossible to recover from inside the script. The only way to be sure to run a bit of code at 4pm tomorrow would be to use a more dependable system, like cron.
I've been having the same problem for ages. If you're new and haven't done much in GUIs then make something with a GUI kit. Literally take the kit and put everything you can find onto a screen and make it do things. At some point you'll think of a cool thing to make and then make whatever that is. 
I think of it more along the lines of being able to use the language you want for whatever project you’re doing. You pick the language that is most productive for you, rather than climbing the often steep curve to learn a new language for each piece of your full service. 
&gt;It brings me gratification that the muslims have to resort to virtue signaling rather than denial of any problem. I'm not denying problems. I'm also not a reactionary xenophobe. Do you see how there is a middle ground? If telling you this is virtue signaling, so be it. &gt;The people helping Pakistan, an enemy of america, are straying dangerously close to being a traitor. https://pk.usembassy.gov/ Why do we have an embassy in our "enemy's" capital? Your rhetoric is embarrassing.
Thats possible, I am new to programming in general:)
Made my first python program outside of codecademy's class. It's a simple Rock Paper Scissors game that keeps track of rounds and score. Still haven't finished the scoreboard though.
What's with the silent downvotes here? Smh. My only response was downvoted here for asking "are there any ways to do it in-script"? Are the redditors in this sub so petty about simple questions and suggestions that they have to instinctively downvote stuff? Sometimes I hate this website.
Yep 100% - portability would be my #1 concern with this. Even python support as an external package wouldn't make much of a difference in the landscape. Theres xlwings, openpyxl already. Unless it becomes built in (either by default or easily enabled) I don't see much changing in terms of actual business use.
Python for crunching, excel/tableau for reporting - because clients understand excel, and pretty charts always impress even if they provide little value. Adding native support for excel doesn't really help with any of this, considering xlwings is already pretty amazing. I'm all for the proliferation of Python, but xlwings is basically a direct swap for VBA other than the fact it's not portable.
Have a look at xlwings - afaik it is essentially a python wrapper for win32. I use it w/ pyodbc for Microsoft SQL Server for workflow automation and have almost no complaints once you get used to it. 
My reporting stack is: Pyodbc pulling from SQL databases Cleaning, munging and analysis in python (pandas + scipy) Writing to excel emailing with python. Set up templates, click a button to email clients report. Easy.
yowsup is a completely different beast than what this guy is doing though; It's going to be much harder for them to block webdriver without harassing regular users.
https://bitbucket.org/amentajo/lib3to2/src/0f0c4b993212207473596fb064e7c33f5cc7bca0/lib3to2/tests/?at=default is a good starting place
Write less code not more, newbies tend to write more code than necessary be essentially re-writing functions that are already available to them. Also iterate on your success, chances are any solution you create is not the optimal one, so always go back to completed tasks and ask 'how can I do this better/faster'
You can't send a detailed, conditionally formatted report with pandas. By writing to excel you can. Especially if you use python to do base level calculations, then use python to write functions into excel at a higher level so people looking at the report can understand what you are calculating and why.
Use xlwings to write to excel. Do all your workflow in python, just output to excel for distribution. Yes it's slower initially, but once you have a good utilities deck set up you can automate the shit out of your daily workflow.
Are you suggesting that people actually write their scripts in WebAssembly? I've written programs in Assembler. No more, thank you!
Whaaaaat! Raymond Hettinger!? That's amazing! Ge didn't even come to PyCon Sweden! 😢
The US has embassies in every country except for North Korea, Bhutan, and Iran. Your suggestion that "having an embassy there" means "we are allies" is a pretty dumb thing to say and I can prove it. By that reasoning, America and Syria, the country we've been beating the shit out of for the last fifteen years is our ally. Did you know Trump's Travel Ban banned people from coming and going from Syria because the concentration of Muslim terrorists is so high, that we don't want any Muslims from there because they are enemy combatants? You call them our ally? We sure have a funny way of treating our allies huh? The government of Pakistan is Islamic State, and some 99.9% of all terrorists are Muslim, specifically Pakistani Muslims. You should work yourselves over to the public educational system documentaries of Pakistan on youtube, killing infidels is part of the curriculum, and you can get HD video of kids age 5 to 15 learning about Jihad and how to slay the western white devils. There is still pure evil in the world rampant in the middle east. And also there is evil state side, in people who wish to hear no evil, see no evil and speak no evil, insisting we let the evil run rampant and grow cancerous Muslim growths on America. All Muslims in Pakistan want Americans dead because their religion requires it. To ignore this and sing the songs of kum-bai-yah means you're a Muslim, or you're a useful idiot to the Muslims. Take a class in game theory and stop apologizing and giving moral support to the enemy.
This was a great read, even for someone who doesn’t fully understand data science. Thanks for sharing. 
If there is an app that you use all the time, try and make a clone of it just to prove to yourself that you can do the same thing. Like a Dropbox clone or Tweet bot. Since you already use the app, you know most of the requirements that will go into it and you might even be inspired to improve on it somehow. 
Thank you
Thank you; I'll keep that in mind.
I do think this is a terrible choice. Mostly because of this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Pakistan in the ligtht of all this I seriously wonder why the Python Software Foundation sponsors this event. I comparison to other PyCons they left out the code of conduct on the linked page, which further proves my point I think.
Once you fix the indentation an empty elif block is still invalid. Give it something to do, or use 'pass' which means nothing 
Bring your Qua'ran to the meetup and ask how this python technology might be used to increase one's Jihad (personal struggle). Maybe use it to help poor Muslims learn about how to make small easily concealed explosives.
Do you have an `__init__.py` file in the folder?
yes it has this in it: from . import *
I'm working with xarray. That's a valuable tool. Works well with dask, for bigger than memory computation for example.
That might be your problem. That line of code means _import everything from the current module into the current module_. Also you probably just want `from IgnoreBin import APIKeys`.
 Bring your Qua'ran to the meetup and ask how this python technology might be used to increase one's Jihad (personal struggle). Maybe use it to help poor Muslims learn about how to make small easily concealed explosives (for personal peaceful reasons of course, Islam is about peace) Not sure why you're all down-voting, Pakistan is where Bin Laden and Al-Queda worked for quite some time while he was organizing the 9/11 strikes and the thousands of other Muslim organized terrorists strikes throughout the world. Helping these Pakistanis in any way, shape, or form is dancing close to the line of treason, providing intellectual, material, or moral support, which if convicted, carries stiff penalties, regardless of your cluelessness or lack of ill intent.
If you want to not have that indentation on the first line: txt = f"""{uuid4()} start the second line at column 0""" Or if you want better readability in the source code form: txt = f"""{uuid4()} Blah blah blah""" txt = '\n'.join(l.strip() for l in txt.splitlines())
Is that Atom? Any tips on getting it configured for Python? 
Still give me the same error :/
are you fucking crazy?
that is Microsoft VS Code [on Mac]. It is really cool. Interactive debugger is the only thing that would act little slow and weird, other wise it is perfect. I use PyCharm when I need to debug to get over that issue. What I miss in PyCharm is a good theme / UI. The default ones make me go take a nap.
hmmm thanks. ok looks like we can make it work. but it kind of feels like work around than the pythonic readability
I can't have given you the same error. It might have given you a similar error. You should post the current version of your code (both files), the complete error that you get, and the layout of your package (what files are where).
Looking at an excel document and trying to figure out exactly what's being calculated and why is much harder than just reading through some pandas code. 
No, quite the opposite, you're thinking of the people who are organizing technology education events in Terrorist run countries like Pakistan. Giving them the tools they need to export more terrorism through the internet.
Hi! Finally I wrote you :) Firstly I would be note my background, in order to be able to share my situation; I am working for being Linux System Administrator; my university background is scientific but I worked with Python an R during my PhD thesis and I fell in love with computers. About the idea I am thinking in develop a web dedicated to analyze the abilities of ppl for identify fake news, and resources for improve it, such as logic thinking, etc. It would be nice to know where should be the first steps in order to get real it. Thank u! 
How's this different from [brython](http://brython.info/)?
This is a tool that just converts the Python code to JS. Brython includes an interpreter and it makes things slow etc. 
In Python, when you get an object back, you can call dir(thingamabob) and it'll give you the methods and stuff
Hot tip, make sure you're OK with being put on every terror-watch list the world has to offer, because this kind of provisioning for material, informational, technological, or moral support to the enemy is a crime that is punished more severely than murder. Last thing we need to do is teach the terrorists in Pakistan how to use the internet to carry out terrorist strikes using drone technology. The organizers of this event are seeing how close they can get to treason without a conviction. Someone do tap them on the shoulder and say they've missed the mark, and need to think about what they're doing here. Pakistan is an exporter of Muslim terrorists and you want to train them in drone technology? Are you all insane?
How about [textwrap.dedent](https://docs.python.org/3/library/textwrap.html#textwrap.dedent) then?
Use [textwrap.dedent\(\)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/textwrap.html): import textwrap def someFunc(): myName = 'Al' print(textwrap.dedent(f''' Dear {myName}, We regret to inform you that your comment has been downvoted. Sincerely, Reddit''')) This produces the output: Dear Al, We regret to inform you that your comment has been downvoted. Sincerely, Reddit Notice that the indentation is removed in the printed output, even though it technically exists in the actual string value. (Though the extra indentation for "Sincerely" is preserved.)
Well, aren't you a wonderful specimen?
I've been meaning to become a Muslim by reciting the Shahada, can you help me?
Good things to do when you just start: 1) Use an actual IDE instead of a text editor. The free Visual Studio Code editor with the Python plugin is a decent free option. https://code.visualstudio.com/ https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python 2) Install a linter. I use Pylint with "pip install -g pylint". VS Code will automatically pickup that this linter is installed and use it. https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint 3) Read the PEP8 style guide so you know the coding conventions like how to name a constant, etc. https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ 4) Before you try to do something "new" check the python docs because what you are trying to do is likely already built-in to python. https://docs.python.org/3/ 5) Use the resources of /r/learnpython and the multitude of free online tutorials 
when you create a virtualenv you can specify a version of python to use with it with the -p flag. for example in linux, I use the following command to initialize a virtualenv with python 2.7: virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 —no-site-packages The — no site packages part tells it to ignore system installed packages 
http://websockets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html
Sublime and atom don't fail in it! It's just how you run it, they both use a stupid/dumb terminal which can only display text and doesn't take input. If you like them or one more than the other keep using it but don't be afraid to open a terminal window and run your code in there. 
raw_input() is python 2. What you want is access to the REPL/runtime. If you're not up to using command line, PyCharm and VSCode are the only ones I've tried that offer REPL right out of the box. Sublime Text w/ PackageControl.io offers a REPL plugin but I haven't gotten it to work yet.
Zindabad
what did he say ? LOL
when you say a visual indicator - do you mean a change in your prompt ? If you are on Linux you can use PROMPT_COMMAND env and set it to a shell function to set the actual PROMPT - and use the get_virtual_env command to identify the actual virtual environment. That doesn't fix your other issues though :-(
I’ve used both `aiohttp` and `websockets` and they both work pretty well, what issue are you seeing?
Why not split the f string? from uuid import uuid4 a = ( f"""{uuid4()}\n""" f"""and another line {uuid4()}""") print(a) 
implicit/explicit concatenation? something = (f'wow nice {uuid}\n' f'I wish I had a {uuid} like that') something = (f'wow nice {uuid}\n' + f'I wish I had a {uuid} like that') something = f'wow nice {uuid}\n' \ f'I wish I had a {uuid} like that' something = f'wow nice {uuid}\n' + \ f'I wish I had a {uuid} like that'
If you're a beginner you should get used to not using an IDE first. Atom/sublime/notepad ++ and use command line to test, install libraries, etc..IDEs will make processes more efficient but you should probably learn first. Also not sure how a text editor fails at using a python module. If you're running python 2 raw_input() works, if you're in python 3 its input().
I may be wrong, but I think that would try to import the “current package”, rather than the module, trying to look for `__init__.py#__all__`. Either way it wouldn’t work, but I think that’s how the `from .` would resolve.
&gt; Can you provide some insight on why Anaconda pulled funding for Spyder? Anaconda is putting a lot of effort to develop a new data science web platform around JupyterLab. Since Spyder is a desktop product, it doesn't fit into that plan and (I think) that's why we got our funding cut. Spyder will continue to live (I'll keep maintaining it) but it's development rate will slow down significantly. If you want to see it to thrive in the future, please consider donating.
Shout-out for ipython (iron-python), makes dir'ing and help'ing python modules and functions a little easier. Also supports autocomplete (tab). Probably a bunch of other stuff, too. But I prefer it to plain python &gt;&gt; shell when exploring libraries.
Hola, gracias Daniel! Disculpa pero no vi tu mensaje sino hasta ahora, porque no contestaste directamente a uno de mis mensajes y Reddit no me mostró una notificación al respecto. Estamos buscando nuevas formas de financiación para continuar manteniendo Spyder en el futuro. Si tienes los medios, por favor considera donar lo que puedas al proyecto en la dirección que mencioné arriba.
Paging /u/kennethreitz 
You can do what you like with the Python AST. Start with [Green Tree Snakes - the missing Python AST docs](https://greentreesnakes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Off of the top of my head other projects that play with the AST include [macropy](https://github.com/lihaoyi/macropy) and [PyPatt - Python Pattern Matching](http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/pypatt-python-pattern-matching/).
Thanks
VS Code is awesome.
I think there are programming languages better suited to committing terrorism than *Python.*
Iron Python is different than ipython. You're talking about ipython (which is a great terminal).
iPython isn't ironPython. ironPython is a .NET implementation of Python. iPython (interactive python), is a powerful interactive shell for Python. [iPython](https://ipython.org/) [ironPython](http://ironpython.net/) 
You can also call `type(obj)` and get the type. Though best to use the documentation. And if the documentation won't tell you, then I'd question whether or not to even use the module.
import heapq heapq.heapify(db) user1=heapq.heappop(db) Etc etc
&gt; average You don't give a shit about average. When you ship something what matters is the worse case scenario for which you still want to serve your application. And 4 more seconds before reactivity is *a lot*.
Indeed you are correct. Woops.
Why the api key need to be in a python module? why not keep it in a configuration file?
Not what you asked, but https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ Used to create pypy
There might be if the library is using an out-of-date URL. 
Neato! In your code the f string didn't end up being indented from the main lines anyhow (unless your intent was to keep them inline), but the dedent worked amazingly.
It's not a tutorial, but this lib has it: https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/tree/rewrite

That's a feature, not a bug.
none of these things are true. if you want to reproduce some of these issues and open them as issues on the repository, feel free, but it's unlikely that any of the above are pipenv problems and far more likely they are problems with your system.
There's always twisted, I guess. Only used it as a server, but the client stuff is there.
Keep it in a configuration file and use [``pkgutil``](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pkgutil.html) to retrieve it. ``pkgutil.get_data`` can load data from a non python file that's being imported from a .zip executable, which enables packaging the library with a script to make a standalone executable. (in pure Python)
This is a very good solution. You don’t even need a join operation because Python strings autoconcat when next to each other. 
UMBC CS representing! Wish they offered a Data Science masters though :(
&gt; And 4 more seconds before reactivity is a lot. Yea, that a worse-case scenario in Somalia. India not even a second. This will also be initial loading time with the second load or refresh using the cache. We were talking third world countries and the assumption that most is connected to the internet with a wet string. Which is not true! &gt; You don't give a shit about average. When you ship something what matters is the worse case scenario for which you still want to serve your application. If this value was hold dear by developers we will see a lot less hybrid, electron and spa. 
This is what I did, thanks.
Just write JavaScript. It's not hard.
When ever I install Pycharm, my first step is to Google for Solaris Dark theme. It's the bee's knees.
How does it need to be "configured"? It has syntax and method completion out of the box.
I swear I saw a pamphlet for it at some point, but every time I bring it up, people look at me like a crazy person. - UMBC master of IO Psych
Congrats! Does cs61a have videos lectures? I don't see anything at this link: https://cs61a.org/
I would donate, if I weren't already a student who is living off of his parents. I'll do the next best thing: contact Anaconda and at least voice an opinion?
Wow great resource. This is an aggregate of the PyCons conferences (worldwide) and is kept up-to-date? 
yes. i tried that and it required authentication. the drive that i have access to is publicly accesible.
[Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) has a lot of possibilities/introduces you to many modules that help translate basic python knowlege into potentially useful stuff.
As long as you're able to authenticate then you can use the API, if you said it belongs to a friend then you can just ask them to authenticate your script.
Yes I'll ask him. Thankyou.
I dont even know how to feel about it. Although that has not limited Python use with Excel. LibreOffice support for Python is pretty Basic too
This adds runtime overhead
I prefer this solution, the best thing about it is that you don't need triple paired quotes... :)
true story! The only time I use triple quotes is for pasting large blocks of text that I may change often and want to conform to 78 char lines. Think large SQL queries. (I used them here just to mimic OP) 
"else" should line up with "if". 
Syntax and completion isn’t necessarily all people look for out of an IDE anymore. 
In a shell like this, if you give enter twice it ends the block and moves to a new input line ( &gt;&gt; ). The else statement is now the first line in a new block, which won’t work. Remove the extra enter so it the if/else will be one block. If and else should be on the same level.

But as you know, the python is not a popular language for Microsoft users, so python is only a choice for Excel, maybe Microsoft will develop a new language, Python# (PythonSharp)
I'll check the slack channel out. The issue I had was getting the event loop from a web framework to cooperate with the event loop that existed in the websocket client. 
TIL. String *literals* only, though. Googling the subject tells me that Guido himself got bitten by this when he forgot a comma. The possibility of removing it from the language was considered then rejected. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/python-ideas/jP1YtlyJqxs%5B1-25%5D
Anything that gets us away from the god forsaken vba
What else do people look for? I'm genuinely curious. My setup is barebones.
The indentation only applies *outside* the multiline string literal, so you can *legally* (syntactically speaking) do this: # NOTE: had to type all this out again myself because you posted a picture and not the text! txt = f"""{uuid4()} is there a way to show this without the indent {uuid4()} this works but need to give up on the readability {uuid4()} """ Next time, please don't post pictures, paste the text in. See "formatting help" link below the submission text box for info on how to format code. It saves your helpers from having to manually re-type your code in order to give you an answer.
You really can just import anything...
It's worth noting that this is already how dicts always work in CPython 3.6, but except in a few specific situations (like keyword arguments and class members) the new order was considered an implementation detail. Now it's guaranteed everywhere.
Goodbye ordered dict?
Well, [IronPython](http://ironpython.net/) is a thing. Although there haven't been any updates for a year now. It allows you to use both .NET and Python libs at the same time. Maybe Microsoft will pick it up.
Windows users can already use DataNitro (a commercial plugin), which is very nice and seems to be popular (over 5,000 users according to website). You can also script excel for free installing pywin32 which is amazing. Of couse it both doesn't compare with a possible official python integration.
important features for me are refactoring tools, (remote) debugging, VCS integration, extensibility, code inspection, code navigation, and a doc reader
This would have been helpful on a Django project recently. I ended up writing a custom filter to unpack a list of tuples instead. 
My biggest issue with Pipenv, and why I have doubts about their "Windows is a firstclass citizen" claim, is that their output is very colourful (odd, but ok) and that they use ANSI colours which are not supported by either cmd or Powershell. End result is that very critical feedback from pipenv is unreadable. How can that have ever passed a usability test?
It's inefficient but sometimes its the only way to go. On the bright side it's a great skill to have and be good at.
All dicts will be ordered dicts
&gt; dict keeps insertion order until deletion Do not get it. Pop will change iteration order?
Can someone explain some of the benefits of this to me? There are some performance benefits (not clear to me why that is either), but it also sounds like there are some use cases people are looking forward to..
It just shows that you don't know what NaN really is. (P.S. Its not JS specific).Please read: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN specifically the section titled **Comparison with NaN**.
**NaN** In computing, NaN, standing for not a number, is a numeric data type value representing an undefined or unrepresentable value, especially in floating-point calculations. Systematic use of NaNs was introduced by the IEEE 754 floating-point standard in 1985, along with the representation of other non-finite quantities like infinities. Two separate kinds of NaNs are provided, termed quiet NaNs and signaling NaNs. Quiet NaNs are used to propagate errors resulting from invalid operations or values, whereas signaling NaNs can support advanced features such as mixing numerical and symbolic computation or other extensions to basic floating-point arithmetic. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Since that line was put in an `__init__.py`, the current package is also the current module.
0E-8 =&gt; 0.00000000 It is science notation. 
🤗😍
Declarative style programming becomes super nice with this stuff. You can lay out forms as classes or dicts and the order is what you had in the code. 
 &gt; Decimal('0E-8') == 0 True
😂
You should probably look at alternative AST libs if you want to do any significant manipulation. I use baron with my mutation tester mutmut. It’s a MUCH nicer api than the built in ast module. 
For sure it'll happen, make sure you have a backup plan 
Good god, if this works, it would be amazing. This could actually usher in a new age of excel scripting. Good on Microsoft for keeping up with the times.
looking at the [faq](https://docs.python.org/2/library/decimal.html#decimal-faq) it seems like you need to call quantize() after multiplication or division if you're expecting to get the same number of places as before.
Think of the order of a dict as the order in which you get keys when you iterate through it (using ```d.items()``` or such). Keeping insertion order into deletion would mean that as you insert items, you will see them in iteration in the same order. Once you delete any of them, however, all bets are off, and the dict could give the rest back to you in any order. (Note that this is *not* the language spec adopted for 3.7, and instead retaining insertion order is *always* guaranteed.)
It may, if the dict is reallocated in the process. 
OrderedDicts have sorting operations that regular dicts wont. So they'll still have uses.
You're going to kick yourself when you read up on the OrderedDict collection. We've all been there, bro.
I'm personally looking forward to things like [this] (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/526125/why-is-python-ordering-my-dictionary-like-so) no longer being points of confusion. 
It's good that Microsoft decided to add Python in excel but we must agree VBA is not obsolete and powerless language. Almost everything can be extended in Microsoft Office trough VBA.
You can pass and Excel report to a client, they can understand what's going on. Half the point of reporting is to make it easily shared and understandable 
[Previous discussion from 2 days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/7jti46/ms_is_considering_official_python_integration)
Let me shed some light upon the considerations that made us decide to create Transcrypt: - PyPyJs was already there, as were the ideas about using WASM as a basis. Two things made use decide to develop a transpiler in spite of that. 1. We wanted to be able to use any JS lib without special interfacing. This meant that datastructures had to be shareable between Transcrypt and JS. Implementing Transcrypt on top of JavaScript enabled us to be compatible on data level. E.g. there's an equivalence between Python dicts and Js object literals that are often used as configuration parameters to JS functions. 2. We wanted pageload times comparable to JS. Solutions based on the combination of CPython bytecode and WASM will require a Python VM that has to reside in the browser. We anticipated that browsers manufacturers will remain reluctant to build in or even cache such a VM. Transpiled code just relies on the JS VM, hence is very lightweigth. Running on the same VM again makes interop with JS libs much simpler. - There were several Python implementations that are interpreted on the fly in the browser. We've tried a few and made the choice to go for precompiled code with a lightweight runtime (20k) to obtain pageload times comparable to JS. Compilation made it possible for us to add source level debugging, i.e. you set breakpoints and singlestep through the original Python code. - Transcrypt wasn't born because JS is difficult to learn. We don't like the prototype based object paradigm. Also since we needed to use it to program scientific applications with a lot of linear algebra going on, we wanted things like operator overloading. Moreover we considered Python a better choice to keep large programs maintainable, especially when combined with static typechecking. This combination of preferences and requirements led us to the conclusion that no time soon would there appear anything to suit our needs, so we decided to go for it ourselves. However there are several alternatives. Choosing between them, including things like Typescript requires a detailed look at what they have to offer.

I feel you man, said something similar before. 
VBA apologia ruins lives
Relevant talk: [Raymond Hettinger Modern Python Dictionaries A confluence of a dozen great ideas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npw4s1QTmPg).
It's because most Microsoft "experts" actively discourage using python to senior level management. So basicaly they block it's adoption and make it seem evil as to not lose market share/profits. Happens in my company. 
Jupyter notebooks is getting there.
VBA is not so bad. It sucks so much, a dedicated freelancer can make good money with it because nobody wanna use it. It kinda became the PHP of the office-world.
Does it work with C-libs too? Because it woild be kinda pointless for excel if pandas, numpy and rest of the cool gang won't work.
Microsoft expert, here. Actual experts choose the right tool for the job. Just because you’re fond of a language, doesn’t make it the correct choice when you factor in things like scalability and maintainability with respect to the size of the application. Python is great for small services, but on larger monolithic applications with medium to large teams, it’s usefulness wanes compared to C# and Java.
Then merge them to regular dicts. Or is anything preventing it?
It's an interesting holdover from C given that the reasoning is completely different. In C, it's so you can stick a preprocessor macro into the middle of a string, eg: "Please enter up to " MAX_LENGTH_S " characters" might expand to something like "Please enter up to " "64" " characters" which the compiler will then concatenate into a single string. Whereas in Python, breaking up a long string literal over multiple lines is probably the most common use case. I can't really think of any others, but that may be my own ignorance.
Or rather, considering the chronology, PHP became the VBA of the web.
That wouldn't be a trivial change and might have significant performance implications. Keep them separate now, but revisit the decision for Py4. 
Not really. But if you can make the C libs accessible from C# somehow, then IronPython could too.
The new implementation [requires less memory](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2012-December/123028.html). 
Excel is going to exterminate Python? How exactly would that work?
&gt; It sucks so much, a dedicated freelancer can make good money with it because nobody wanna use it. This is how I made my living while as a student. :D ...then I moved to working with VB6. That language sucked.
There are a lot of angry weirdos on /.
I tried those fist, they don't preserve order when used in django template tags. Probably type casted to a normal dict before the tag evaluates it in the template. The best solution was just a list of tuples and a custom tag to allow int based access to the cells for each tuple in the list. 
You can use [XLWings](https://www.xlwings.org/) package to do thus as well 
Py3.6+ dicts store entries in an append-only list. Say five entries are added, the second is then deleted, and then a sixth is added. There are two basic options: append this new item at the end and maintain insertion order, or reuse the entry slot vacated by the deleted second item. With the addition of some very minor complexity, this second approach is doable in constant time. However, always appending as Python does now sacrifices a bit of space efficiency (and time efficiency for dicts that undergo large numbers of insertions and deletions while staying about the same size), and in exchange we also get to keep the ordering guarantees in all situations.
By pumping a load of money into proprietary extensions. That's usually how it's panned out.
What kind of work did you with it?
With all this talk of dicts and insertions I think I need to go jerk off. 
Sorry, I'm still not getting it. Could you give you me an example of what you mean or point me to somewhere I could see some more examples?
VB6? Web stuff that was later migrated to PHP/Java. It was spaghetti code upon spaghetti code. Not really my best days.
&gt; But if you can make the C libs accessible from C# somehow If it's straight up C (or an exported C API, as is the case with some C++ libraries), then p/invoke is perfectly adequate. For C++ libraries, [C++/CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B/CLI) exists for just such a purpose. Binding C/C++ to .NET is actually quite simple.
**C++/CLI** C++/CLI (C++ modified for Common Language Infrastructure) is a language specification created by Microsoft and intended to supersede Managed Extensions for C++. It is a complete revision that aims to simplify the older Managed C++ syntax, which is now deprecated. C++/CLI was standardized by Ecma as ECMA-372. It is currently available in Visual Studio 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2017, including the Express editions. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
&gt; pandas, numpy I think the point is using Excel to do the tasks pandas and numpy do. If given half a chance I would trade Excel for pandas.
Ah yep - good spot :). I must have been too focused on the other details.
Back in the old days of ASP 2.0, MS extended IIS so that you could do server side scripting on any of the most popular languages. Vast majority of the sites still only used VB. I think the same will happen here, obsolescence doesn't factor in. &gt; Almost everything can be **very painfully** extended in Microsoft Office trough VBA.
I don’t know about this library what you use, but I have some clues about speeding up loading data. Maybe you should move your data to the DB? Postgres for example. And read from DB not from raw files. Before add rows to the DB you can pre-process some of the records on the fly for further usage.
Let’s take a simple example of a menu: menu = dict( products=[...], about=..., ) In Python &lt; 3.6 you couldn’t just loop through that dict and generate the menu of your site because the order might flip randomly. 
I don’t think they’ve decided yet
That moment when you diss Python scalability on Reddit...
Yep, no idea how but it's certainly possible. 
I meant project scalability. Reddit’s codebase isn’t that big.
I think they will have to conform to the standards because the resources are out there for standard Python and developer familiarity. Otherwise this doesn't make sense. Google went with Java for android mainly to avoid learning a new language just for Android. I think MS has similar thinking.
Let's say I want to load the data into a DB. But I want to process records on the fly, i.e before loading, so that the DB will have a transformed and reduced set of my data. Is there some precautions I must take?
First of all questions about learning python should be asked in [r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython). Second your code isn't very clear can you use a codeblock please to make your code clearer. If you need help on this see the formatting help.
This is literally all I want for Christmas 
[Keep digging.](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/uk_faculty_connection/2016/12/06/openstack-and-azure-hybrid-data-centers/)
Python is used quite a bit in deep learning, I believe. It's the recommended language for controlling [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/get_started), for example. The intensive numerical code is written in a faster language, but you can control it from Python. The performance of the model is going to depend on what the problem is, how good you need the results to be, and how much computing power you can afford to throw at it.
What do you consider big?
Python is googles lingua franca. It's unlikely todays microsoft could destroy that.
Dude, brython is totally web-scale.
There was a [post about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/7jyluw/dict_knownordered_versus_ordereddict_an/) a couple of days ago. To summarise: the standard dict, which is now ordered, is implemented differently to OrderedDict. OrderedDict takes more memory, and is a bit slower for some operations, but it allows some extra operations which would be inefficient with a normal dict. This is bound to be confusing, though.
Dude sometimes I use a third party library that edits excel files without opening the application because I absolutely hate vba. I think it was called NPIO and written by a team in China. "Excel"lent library for people who prefer c#
Ok, I see. Don't worry about donating then. You could contact Anaconda if you want and express your opinion. I doubt that would change things, but at least they will be aware that people in the community consider Spyder valuable and worth the financial investment.
sorry for that. i think its better like that: n = int(input("Value for n: ")) k = int(input("Value for k: ")) print(str(n) + " numbers divisble by " + str(k) + " are: ") i = 1 while n &gt; 0: if i % k == 0: print(i) n -= 1 i += 1
Yeah. The vast majority of my terrible spaghetti code is in VB6 and VBS. 
Extensions? Like, python packages for excel? I don't know how possibly that would hurt Python.
Finally no need to use OrderedDict anymore. &lt;3 
Pandas is my favorite. The pandas dataframe data structure makes it super easy to read in, manipulate, and write out excel files.
* n = int(input("Value for n: ")) * k = int(input("Value for k: ")) print(str(n) + " numbers divisble by " + str(k) + " are: ") * i = 1 * while n &gt; 0: * if i % k == 0: * print(i) * n -= 1 * i += 1 hope its better like this
I hope a change like this could roll over into formulas. I'd love to be able to structure an individual cell a little bit more like a sub routine instead of one giant nested statement. Might make it a little daunting for non-programmers but the ability to format/comment could go a long way for read-ability. 
You can do this in VBA, so I imagine you'd get to in any new language too
Wouldn't F# be a better option?
Awesome, that will make malicious excel files so much easier to write
I've heard companies are walking away from excel because it takes too much to keep them updated. I wonder if this is a response. 
Projects that grow to thousands or tens of thousands of files. [Reddit](https://github.com/reddit/reddit) is incredibly small for what it is. Which is awesome.
Yes. But xlwings let you modify a spreadsheet that it's open in excel.
People are using python not because of the language alone. Libs are a very important part. Even if excel could deliver the same functionallity, which I doubt, the existing code wouldn't be instantly useable.
yeah it worked. But I'm trying to scrape whole website not just it's first page. Any idea?
Take the source code from the site. And make another nested loop. Take the links scraped from the homepage, then do get requests on those and scrape those links as well.
Xlwings also supports pandas, it's super neat.
That's awesome! Find a niche, hit it hard. Modern marketing 101. 
I'm excited about this. 
I really don't understand why remembering one of Microsoft's most [infamous, and well known strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish) gets so much hate on this sub.
Its no longer the '90s or aughts. Balmer's gone. Microsoft is doing really cool shit these days. Apple has stagnated. The world is topsy-turvy!
Amen
What would be the point of Excel then? Why not use use a real database at that point?
I mean, if you want to apply it to a situation that makes sense, I'm all ears. 
 &gt; &gt;Python is great for small^* services, but on larger monolithic applications with medium to large teams, it’s usefulness wanes compared to C# and Java. &gt; But we are talking about Excel integrattion here. If your "large service" has Excel components in it, then I'd seriously question your competency.
excel is not database software lol
But people abuse it like it is. That's the whole problem. 
ohhhh I see what you're saying. Yeah. I was interviewing office assistants with my team last week and one of them said "I do EVERYTHING in excel!" and she was so proud. *facepalm
I don't know what's worse: Python or VBA. https://zenhack.net/2016/12/25/why-python-is-not-my-favorite-language.html
Or web standards by including it in IE6. No damage there done at all. Also C++ is all over the place partly because of Microsoft's "contributions" in that regard.
When hiring an office assistant, isn't Excel a reasonable skill to have?
Yes. but when you use third party vendors to supply access to workflow and productivity tools, you should probably use the tool that's best for the job. Especially if you work for a college that has tiny budgets for certain departments. Oh and I should mention, we were hiring internally. The person I was talking to has been able to get by with just excel for so long, she thought it was a useful skill in regards to the new position.
If you're just going to jump into someone else's conversation and downvote before you are responded to, why bother making a comment in the first place?
import os, sys, http, ...
Poor fella....did I hurt your feelings?
I remember cursing that in Excel between 2000 to 2003 (or round about then) they changed the command of how you set the value of cell (x,y) to z to something completely different. I always had to look up how to do the most basic stuff and then they changed the most basic function possible! I have touched it as little as possible since.
recovering excel addict? no such thing, bud. But yeah, i'm super excited about this.
It's currently impossible that /u/chief167 was saying his company actively discourages using python on excel documents. No, we're not talking about using Excel right now. I'm replying to his blanket statement about "microsoft experts"
This will make writing unit tests around anything involving dicts a lot less annoying.
&gt; This is how I made my living while as a student How did you go about doing this? I want compensation for the hours of my life lost to learning VBA
Is my response common when you try to "hurt people's feelings"? I think it would be more accurate to say that I am disappointed in your ability to understand the basic functions of reddit. Please [at least try to read and follow the rules,](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) or consider using another content aggregator where rules are shunned (Voat).
Microsoft has lost much relevance in the last 5 years.
Agreed. A big problem with a Python to JS compiler is that you lose so many libraries which actually use C under the hood, and creating bindings to equivalent JS libraries is a large amount of work. A WASM environment can circumvent this problem since C targets it as well.
Python doesn't do type casts. You might be thinking of mypy typing.cast
I'm asking because I really don't know. What is Excel really used for? I've been working for over 20 years in various fields, and about 20 years ago we used Excel to get reimbursed for travel expenses. I haven't really seen it used since. It's just a simple 2d grid of values with a simple language to update some of the grid values. What do people use Excel over a database or real programming languages today?
Assembly is a powerful language. Do you want to write excel code in assembly? Probably not. VBA isn't powerless but it has way too much baggage in exchange for what it does do.
hmm time to suggest it to those open/libre office teams.
Good call Reddit police
Oh shit, count me in! I hate Excel, but it's not going away. I have hundreds of complicated etl workflows and still find myself having to update Excel spreadsheet for a few stakeholders that refuse to use either Google docs or box. For those situations I welcome python in Excel
I think you're confused. That has very little to do with what I'm talking about. Project scalability is largely referring to scaling the amount of developers working on a project together, size of the code base, and degradation of tooling as the codebase grows. Not sure what that has to do with hybrid data centers.
PRAY
EVERYTHING. I've been an IT director or consultant in a dozens companies. It is everywhere. I have seen entire financial reporting systems for billon $ companies written by accountants in Excel. 
The way it would work, they would extend python with cool new enhancements to the language that would not compile on other versions. 
Why not Lua? It already has tables.
I think part of the beauty of excel is that is allows for the rapid generation of simple GUIs. While possible in libreoffice and wps I haven't been able to achieve the same level of efficiency with them (although I heavily use these wonderful products on all my linux laptops). Being able to do all the calculations in Python while combining the interface of excel has been an awesome experience.
How do you code abstract algebra? 
Type "conversion" 
&gt; not so bad &gt; it sucks Hmmm

As much as I hate Microsoft and Excel, this could actually be pretty useful. I'm curious what would an integration of Python with Pandas an Excel would look like.
&gt;This could actually usher in a new age of excel scripting. How is this a good thing? I've been told a story one about a chemical plant where the valves and whatnot were controlled by an Excel sheet. 
That's not an issue with Excel though, that's an issue with an idiot not knowing any other system to control a chemical plant with. Making Excel more capable doesn't cause more people to be fundamentally stupid, it just makes the capable people more capable. 
Excel sheets are the last place you want to do scripting complex enough to need a touring complete programming language, let alone one as powerful as python.
Exactly. You can’t decide to hold back a technology for fear of how people might mis-use it.
How do you mean?
And pypy since a few years back.
I use Sololearn app and it's not so bad, mostly challenges I'm interest in. But it also have pretty good guides too, in my opinion.
Who needs Excel when you've got a growing arsenal of more powerful components in Jupyter notebooks? Jupyter is one spreadsheet component away from requiring Excel at all.
That's a lot of hate, my friend. But I assure you, it's nothing of that sort. The media does a great job of portraying Pakistan as a terrorist country, and I don't disagree with what you know or what your views are. My point is, just take a moment to look up how Pakistan is a developing economy, and home to several technologically advanced organizations and institutions working for the betterment of the country and its people. Granted, it hasn't been a super peaceful country, but it's not like everyone is a terrorist or working towards a violent agenda. That's less than a fraction of the whole population, and is kept under control by the authorities. The positives clearly outweigh the negatives, but sadly they aren't what gets promoted most of the time. Peace!
clearly that's so habitual I don't even think of them as strings!

It was a joke, but I do dislike VBA. The argument that you can do "almost everything" with it isn't very compelling either – you can do "almost everything" with any Turing-complete language, even Brainfuck. My main problem with VBA is it takes a long time to do anything complicated, because you'll probably have to write it yourself
I have pythonista on my phone and iPad. While you can do large programs, I find myself using it a lot for small experiments with new concepts or ideas. I actually find it helpful to retype from memory since most are small and simple. You can email scripts if you want. I haven't done anything with Dropbox. But it's great for lunch breaks at work and waiting for the elevator. Plus it includes the docs. 
Thanks, I appreciate it. Have you tried any of the other apps as well?

Reading through this, I understand the difference between these and OrderedDicts so I presume they will stick around for a bit. But, will OrderedDicts be reimplemented (with whatever needed changes) to take advantage of the speed improvements in dict?

OpenStack "has had 931,080 commits made by 10,618 contributors representing 9,092,446 lines of code." 75% of that is in Python. And Microsoft counts among the contributors. [Source](https://www.openhub.net/p/openstack) Is that scalable enough for you? 
Analysts use it everyday because unlike programming languages I can hand a file over to a person not very competent in anything software wise and can follow exactly what is happening and make an immediate change. If I hand them a python script, they would no idea how to even run it let alone make changes they want. This has been true for finance analysts, marketing and supply chain teams, all the way up through execs up in several large Fortune 500 companies I’ve worked in. I can’t even get them to let me install python on my PC.
I am totally in favor of this. Excel is really a lot of people's first introduction to "programming" without them realizing it: creating formulas for cells that update other cells which in turn update other cells and produce output as charts is the beginning of programmatic thinking.
shh bby. I’m not trying to say it’s not possible. It’s just not common. Really not shitting on python, here. I use it every day.
have you used scrapy or requests ?
reddit is not open source, that is very old code.
Last commit was 2 months ago...
I'm using requests in the scrapyour.site app. Look under the lib folder in the src
That was more than 10 years ago, I was freelancing, clients came by recommendation. Not enough money for a real person, but for a student it was enough.
I haven't seen source code yet, because I've read that it's built using Flask and I have no knowledge of it, I'm a django developer.
I really hope this follows through although with all the Unix/ms crossover anything could happen now!
Excel is how every no-programmer programs things. I like to say that the entire world runs on excel and coffee; the statement isn't fat from the truth. As an engineer, I use excel all the time to build simple calculators. Could it be done in Python or another programming language? Sure, but I know excel and so does everyone else at my company. I want to build better tools and Python in excel would be incredibly powerful for that. 
Flask is used for the html templating and the routes. BeautifulSoup and requests are the libs doing the heavy lifting. Those will be transferrable with what you're trying to do
okay then I'll definitely give it a try, thanks for your help bro.
It's not being in the python sub that's the problem. It's contradicting yourself by starting with "roght tool for the right job" and later generalizing about python without context. Maybe your own experience doesn't translate but you exercise caution when there's so many successful counter examples to your point. 
He did a live-stream. He didn't go there (Pakistan) in person. 
Ah, that's too bad... Would've been sweet if he showed up in person, and a real boon to Pakistan's Python community, I'm sure. Still, cool of him to participate, I suppose.
Yup. However, I am pretty sure that after the success of this PyCon Pakistan we can try to bring in international speakers to the next year's PyCon :) 
Now they come sliming....pfff
Oh, it went well? Good turnout? That's so nice to hear! Here's hoping for a success next year, too. 👏
I agree I could have been less heavy handed in my response to his heavy handed statement. You’re not wrong.
*recovering excel addict? no such thing, bud* True. I use Excel for _everything._ Grocery list? Excel, with VBA module to sort by store aisle. Write a letter? Excel. Make toast? Excel. Cut the lawn? Fire up ol' Excel. Yeah... I have a problem.
Yup from what I heard over 400 people attended it. Considering that this was the first Python conference in Pakistan and that most people in the country are not very familiar with Python, I think it can be considered a success.
this. Trust me, corporate America uses excel everywhere, in fact the higher you go, the more pervasive it is. 
Nice Taqiyya there, I almost bought it! Thank you captain red herring, for changing the subject about educating Muslim terrorists to a debate about "which computer language is the best". It appears I've found a nest of terrorist sympathizer Muslims on reddit. To the Muslims reading this and downvoting. What happened to your great great... great grandparents in Baghdad will happen again. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJqk8-GWBkU Except rather than swords and horsemen, it's aircraft, economic warfare, and rather than taking your gold, it will be taking your middle eastern oil.

Microsoft have been making some very exciting decisions recently. Making visual studio free, vscode, .net core.
Dude, you didn't even get all the words right. 
The short answer is that while insertion order of regular dicts is maintained, deletes are allowed to rearrange keys arbitrarily, and there is no way to rearrange keys in place. OrderedDict doesn't have those restrictions, but its implementation uses more memory, so using it everywhere (since every object without `__slots__` is backed by a dict) would be prohibitively expensive.
What OS? In windows, you can use the `PIL.ImageGrab` to grab a screenshot. The PIL Image can then easily be converted to a numpy array so you can slice out the area you want and do math with the pixel values.

I've always said I could build a house with just a screwdriver. I could cut things with the blade end (would take forever), I could measure things with it (as long as I knew exactly how long the screwdriver was), I could hammer things with the handle part, and last but not least, I could screw things together. And at the end of the day, I could stir my orange juice and Vodka together with it as I drink myself into Oblivion knowing that the only tool I have at my disposal is a screwdriver and tomorrow will bring about even more pain and frustration. And in the end, I will have built a small ramshackle hovel which will be my grave after I eventually succeed in stabbing myself in the heart with a very dull, beat up screwdriver.

Why the Microsoft hate? Pre-2013 I totally understand, but “new” Microsoft is doing a great job!

I'm sure there's plenty of great examples of successful large scale python projects. That doesn't make it a great choice in every case. If we're talking about "experts", pragmatism defines language choice, not what happened to work for a specific case. Now that I'm back at a computer, no, your example is actually awful. OpenStack has 1,568 repositories on github. I'm talking about single projects, not groups of projects. Python is great for shit loads of small projects, in fact that's what I advocate at my company. However, for single large projects, python probably isn't the greatest option. I'm not saying people can't make it work, but I Java and C# provide features up front that make large scale applications easier, up front. 
I'm not sure that qualifies as "keeping up with the times" but it's a step in the right direction.

Microsoft has been changing lately, I actually believe they could do that. ( we'll see ) 
I think it might be better to have the people to fill the forms online and then automate the rest of the things yourself. Otherwise, every single step you have here is feasible. By the way, it might be easier and faster to use a csv file instead of an Excel file, since you can just append to it instead of opening it, writing to it, then saving it.

For bookings - you could convert the pdf forms to web forms which put the results straight into a database. - your webstore software may already support this (which do you use?) - there are many online services which make it easy to create and style forms ie WuFoo, Google Forms, Formstack, etc - you can do it yourself ie with Flask and WTForms - (note that you want to be VERY careful about security with anything exposed to the internet, especially if payment info is involved!) See an intro at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzaXBm-ZVOQ Instead of (/in addition to) receiving the receipt as an email, you can probably get it as a webhook (ie the webstore software can call your "received a receipt" script directly). The script can create and send a templated email response automatically. So long as the form has understandable fields for rental gear, lunch, etc, this can be handled automatically. If it is more free-form input you may still need to hand-process this extra information. Once the information is in a database, it should be very straightforward to create daily spreadsheets from it. Does the output need to be a spreadsheet? Would a web page work? Because a web app might be more flexible - each coordinator could sign in, see a calendar view of their bookings for the month, pull up daily summary pages, make notes etc, all on their cellphone.
Also `set`, I imagine?
Put 4 spaces in front of the code line to format it correctly (AFAIK)
Having used this for a few weeks now, I'm shocked it isn't common knowledge. This is easily my most-used package.
A small but growing number. I'd guess about 2%. Why do you ask? 
I'm pretty sure the 'G' in Spaghetti stands for 'goto'.
&gt; there is no visual indicator that i'm in a pipenv shell stefan@antares:~/Projects/tss-server$ pipenv shell (tss-server-Wgd47OHU) stefan@antares:~/Projects/tss-server$ Ok, so the `-Wgd47OHU` part is a bit confusing, I am not entirely sure what the point of that is, but this is pretty much similar to `virtualenv` right? 
What do companies replace it with then? Genuinely curious. 
Jesus Christ, I didn't think it would be*that* bad. Then I clicked the link.
Ahh, reddit love. What's the best way for me to get starting. codecademy?
I need this! I’m about to build a function into my discord bot that scrapes Twitter feeds and posts links when there are new updates!!
i'm only guessing most people have not seen well written vba code or well structured excel workbooks for this much hate for excel. this reminds me of joel spolsky's video on excel. most people don't use 5% of the features available in excel. 
why not just use C#
alot of the world runs on excel. 
this!
because not everyone is a sperglord from silicon valley
please do it-- excel is the threshold of computing for some many people -- smart idea
replacing vba with anything is a good idea.
In addition to what others said, when collaborating inter-team and inter-company, Excel is used all the time. Especially since varying levels of technical people or non-technical people may need the information or need to update it.
What the fuck are you even talking about. You’re being rude to an office assistant because she’s not proficient with databases?
Ooohhhh
Just assuming that this is serious, which somehow I very much doubt, see [PyLadies – Women Who Love Coding in Python](www.pyladies.com/).
Where did you read that I was rude to her. She got the job lol. Everyone on this sub must be some neckbeard mongoloid motherfuckers
There is always one account type who only knows excel and he uses it in every possible scenario you can imagine or you can not even imagine. That's not Excel's fault really. 
https://api.imgur.com/ ?
Real databases, probably.
Just use anaconda... also lol at parting shot.
After some investigation that seems the best solution. I'll have to deal with parsing json and generating exceptions but it's better than nothing
You're right that the the example you've given isn't very useful as it's already covered by os.listdir(). There are many other commands which aren't though. Subprocess.run can execute and capture the output of **any shell** command.
In fact, Python is not a irreplaceable language and it supported for Microsoft not very well, as Ruby, most developers use it in unix-like. And Microsoft users prefer use the microsoft-ownself products, also Microsoft had develop a lot of languages
A major contributor to Python, several Python projects, and Director for Python Software Foundation is a woman. BTW, we use the word "woman" to describe adult females. You've got to up your trolling game.
I don't really get it. You designed this and you want to know whether there's a connection?
If the app is available from the command line you could use Shell process to brute-force the pass. Otherwise you'll need a packet sniffer or something like that (e.g tcpdump), then watch a couple of requests being sent in order to find the IP/Port to send your requests to. 
yeah, Python is suit for small or medium project
maybe Microsoft will develop a new python-like language Python#（PythonSharp), as like as C#, F#...
Giving educational materials to terrorists is a high crime, can someone get on the horn here and contact homeland security about this, get them some anal probes at the airport to make sure they're not hiding bomb-making materials for Pakistani ISIS in there.
Hey man, let me know if you're still interested in scraping LinkedIn. I can help you get around some of their scrape prevention methods.
I know, but I haven’t been in the MS world in years and I just assumed VBA was gone by now. 
Number one on my list would be the use of functions and classes to organize the code, rather than doing everything in one big chunk of linearly arranged code.
i heard they was gonna replace it with C#. VBA isnt really a good "language" I guess, but for automating shit in Excel its fine, IMO.
Okay so is that kind of like "pinging" a website, but for an app instead? 
But what's number zero on your list? Joking aside, I would say: test driven development, documentation, code style.
&gt; I'll have to deal with parsing json and generating exceptions but it's better than nothing [`requests`](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) can handle JSON parsing for you. [`slumber`](https://github.com/samgiles/slumber), built atop `requests` makes it easy to communicate with RESTful APIs.
I like /u/justusenumbers idea a ton. I made something a while back to scrape images from /r/EarthPorn. I use Linux Mint, and I can change the wallpaper with os.system("gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri '{}'".format(filename) 
Knowing when it's appropriate to use language idioms, things such as mixins, decoraters, list comprehensions, generators, etc
+1 Test driven development is a big one
There's no one single answer to your question. Below I'm describing some traits of good professional programmers. The description is in now way exhaustive, and some professional Python programmers may deviate from some of the said below without becoming amateurs. You code in such a way, that the code still makes sense to you when you come back to it in a few months, or years. Also, you're following most of conventions, so that it's easy to catch up for your fellow colleague programmers. For this reason, you cover the code with tests - changes are safer and easier in covered/tested code. I consider these the main ones. Also, you must be good in naming things, understand how to code efficiently/well, know a lot of things about the language and surrounding ecosystem: standard library and perhaps some libraries outside of it, as well as to be able to reason about why you're using each of them. Also, it's important to know where language limitations are, and to be able to tell where to step aside, and to pick another more suitable tool for the job. Overall people write books regarding this subject, and spend a lot of time to master it, so don't expect full topic coverage in a short response or two to your post.
So once it reorders itself, that new order is permanent until you remove more items?

TDD anyone?
PHP in Excel would be an improvement of a dozen order of magnitude.

A Command-line interface is like DOS or BASH. You can use python libs to automatically start a process which would give you a method of automating the submission of lots of logins to the app. Lots of programs have some Command line interaction available. A packet-sniffer will let you view the details of the information you send every time you enter your password into the app - including source IP/port and destination IP/port. This is different to pinging, which attempts to start a small conversation with another host - if the host replies, it's online. 
Sometimes you don't want your subprocesses to run bash at all. Also note that you can run more than one subprocess at a the same time.

 n = int(input("Value for n: ")) k = int(input("Value for k: ")) print(str(n) + " numbers divisble by " + str(k) + " are: ") i = 1 while n &gt; 0: if i % k == 0: print(i) n -= 1 i += 1 `n-= 1` is a short form for `n = n - 1` and `i += 1` is short form for `i = i + 1`. Short and long forms have the same result. BTW, you can replace the last 6 lines with print([k*i for i in range(n)]) (but you'll learn all that when you get better at Python)
I love Python. But I really wish Microsoft would fuck right off already. They're like that kid in college who tries too hard to be super nice to you, while they're secretly plotting to steal everything you own and care about.

This would be the best thing ever in my company. We are already doing epic stuff with macros. But, boy howdy, throw in some python and we will create EPIC stuff.
You’re making fun of the fact that an office assistant is proficient in and gets her job done in Excel. Somehow we’re the neckbeards for calling you an idiot?

I doubt that. It will change at some point as it's an implementation detail.
Isn't that what separates a beginner from an intermediate programmer? That can't be a defining attribute separating amateur from professional.
It's the most important one, as far as I'm concerned. I didn't say it's the only one, by any means.
[imgurpython](https://github.com/Imgur/imgurpython) claims to be deprecated thought it may still work for your needs. I still have it running in projects that retrieve images from Imgur but I have not used it for uploading or any advanced interaction.
Microsoft has been actively grooming Python users recently, for example, making the Python vscode extension official and even running a survey on its usage. Due to its modular structure it wouldn't be hard to integrate Python in Office and even Windows itself. No need to develop anything from scratch, a good client library for popular .net classes would be more than enough.
[removed]
This is even more unexpected : &gt;&gt; new Number(1) == new Number(1) false
I suppose that Microsoft don't regard it as a official language, and only is a option, let user decide to use VBA or Python, as like as Microsoft the Ubuntu. Because Python become more and more popular. And in fact, Microsoft had given a Python support in Visual Studio. So it is only added a language for Excel at the most.
You haven't said anything that really suggests that it doesn't suck.
Ability to use outside/specialist libraries &amp; APIs without much problem? Or maybe the ability to read documentation and then utilize. Those are issues I see.
Xarray would also be good, and perhaps Dask.
Being paid is a major one.
miguel grinberg has a library for it. I've used websockets and asyncio for a project at work before
I agree, I used to work on the RAD team on the Derivatives Desk and if a trader wanted to have some control over some piece of data, Excel cannot be beaten in the time it takes to get something out. The trader hated the long process it took for IT to get anything done. One day we had a good laugh when he posted a simple requirement to the IT Manager, he told him he'd dicuss it with the team, a week later he was told they agreed on how to implement it and 2 weeks later they were done drawing up UML diagrams, they never actually delivered anything. Really amazing how middle managers in IT managed to pull wool over everyone's eyes for so long.

try to format your json differently, havent had experience with micropython, but i'd try fragmenting that json 
You nailed it.
Any recommendations for TDD and documentation materials? 
I've been doing freelance work for myself for years. I pay myself in hand jobs. 
easy walk through here that will convert your PDF's to Excel automatically with high accuracy :) https://pdftables.com/blog/pdf-to-excel-with-python You can convert many PDF's at once too with a bit of a script tweak!
I am not sure if this would work as my development board is limited both in ram and flash. 
Just do this? menu = [ ("products", []), ("about", []) ]
Yes, just reach out to pycharm-support@jetbrains.com and we'll help get it sorted. Nudge me here on reddit if that doesn't work.
Welp, I've got 2/3 down. Seconding the other request - where can I find out how exactly unit tests work and can be integrated with one's code?
Is there any functional difference between this and inspect.cleandoc()?
when i was learning python, i had 2-3 books opened, python docs, google and pycharm+command line. command line comes in pretty handy to test out things you read about - makes you remember it better and differentiate better since you are actually writing code. 
Ok, it's not entirely perfect for my code, but otherwise that's the way to go! awesome
see also: - https://github.com/vikstrous/pirate-get - https://github.com/jingnanshi/kickass-get
This is the only difference. I've seen terrible code from people paid to write it, and beautiful code from hobbyists. The only thing that makes you a professional is being paid.
You're looking for a GUI toolkit. Take a look at GTk+ and Qt. 
I'm not sure putting this in the spec is a good idea, since it introduces more restrictions on how dict can be implemented. Consider that the only reason this change is possible now is *because* dict order was not specified, which makes it possible to change the implementation without breaking anything. If one day someone comes up with an even better implementation which doesn't guarantee order, we'll be stuck. 
A lot of people will say specific things like generators or testing or whatever but the main thing is organization and clarity of code. I'm the senior developer on a team of like 5 people, The difference between my code and everyone else's is mine is super logical the grouping of code, I try to not nest multiple different methods together like herp_derp(get_bla().dsadsa()), I get a lot of that shit sent to me from the juniors. While it's ok and probably works it doesn't mean it's clear. Another big thing is naming of variables and classes and keeping to pep8. A lot of the devs I work with come from Java so I get a lot of awful names like FormatBla rather than format_bla, it's a small thing but variables should be all lowercase separated by _ and same goes for methods. For classes camelcase is fine but for everything else the other way is more python like. Oh and also having just decent names for your methods, variables and classes is a massive thing people forget about. I get a lot of dasdsada1, dasddsa2 even at times and while I understand the logic of what they are doing they can reuse the variable most of the time, they are just doing it because they don't know it looks like shit. 
Or, if it's like most commercial code I've seen, there are a few token tests and a little documentation. Code style is mostly OK and mostly passes pep8... but there will be some knarly bits,
If you want something lightweight, then try PyImGUI.
I always thought Microsoft missed a trick not embracing Python more fully. It would have made far more sense to use that as their official scripting language than invent the bastardised C# thing called PowerShell.
I've not coded in it for a while but is that really true (nobody wants to use it)? I thought it's very popular with middle managers and other office workers who are able to write something quickly rather than go through IT and wait ages for sign off.
Properly planning out a project in such a way that you are coding for the final product right away. Rather than Exploratory Programming, and constant refactoring. Im hoping it's a level that exists. 
You don't need to be a professional in order to write non-horrible code.
Have a look at MusicBrainz Picard. Entire thing is written in python. Its a great tool. 
why is FormatBla an awful name? is there any technical factor to make it awful? honest question.. i kinda like them
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-names
You write tests. 
No, this entire thread is about BDFL guaranteeing insertion order maintenance from 3.7. From 3.7, it wont be an implementation detail.
Then you lose the ability to refer to them as menu["products"] when not looping through it. I think that's why you wanted to keep them in a dict in the first place. If you had to offer that for use in an interface you'd probably want a separate "PRODUCTS_INDEX = 0" somewhere.
Thank you! I start doing right away
Neat. This s definitely one thing Im interested in.
It's mostly just to make sure everyone is following the same styles. It's heavily hinted by the python developers to do it like this really but they allow people to do what they want even if it's stupid.
Does OrderedDict have same behavior?
Does OrderedDict have same behavior?
Read these books: Effective Python and Fluent Python Also watch this Raymond Hettinger talk: [Beyond PEP8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M)
It's a weird question to ask, but I'd say: if you can successfully contribute to a major project like bokeh or pandas, with however small a patch, you will have understood some fundamental things needed to work in a larger organization. Communicating with other humans, is the TL;DR of it.
I should clarify that this is *not* the new language spec. The behavior I described will *not* happen in 3.7. However, if it were, then yes, it would probably keep the same order until you deleted more. 
Gnarly?
OrderedDict always guarantees insertion order, to my knowledge - I haven't looked at the documentation in a while, though, so this may be more nuanced or wrong entirely. 
As far as I know, no. 
There is some network and server overhead involved in creating and maintaining a new database connection. How much is hard to describe; it doesn't matter much usually if you do a reasonable amount of work but if you have a ton of tiny tasks (like upping a single counter) then total runtime and load might actually increase. There is also the option of batching work: instead of tasks processing a single 'job' per task call send them in batches. I don't know about Gevent, I'm weary of the magic and unknowns. Maybe just try the naive approach and create the new connection for every task, then maybe batch jobs, and if that isn't performant enough see about other options like Gevent or Celery or whatever. 
I'm using a raspberry pi3 with raspian. I'm learning from the book "python crash course" 
not .run but I use subprocess.call for sending a starting and finishing flag to my zabbix server and I have an alert if a report runs over a certain amount of time 
I feel like guaranteeing insertion order until first deletion is kind of a weird decision. Guaranteeing insertion order forever, at least, might be a guarantee I could see myself making use of in normal contexts. But the second I start relying on this, someone's going to come along and mutate the dict in a way that screws up the insertion order and cause a bug in code that I've written. So I'd end up having to write a comment about the fact that it relies on the insertion order; and I may as well just write it differently. (all postfixed will "usually") Granted, there are certainly situations with more fundamental code that relies on the order of definition of class variables or kwargs or whatnot; but those specific cases are already guaranteed.
Several people have responded now telling me basically that what I said was necessary but not sufficient to be a professional. I never said otherwise, so I'm not sure why that needs to be pointed out again. I totally agree with what you're saying. It doesn't contradict what I said. I'm a little befuddled as to why people keep correcting something that isn't incorrect. Would you mind explaining what made you feel the need to respond like this? Did my choice of words make it sound as though I thought nothing else mattered?
Generators are great for reducing memory usage on runtime, you could potentially write your response as a generator
Does it need to be JSON or could you use something more compact and parse friendly? Do you control the incoming data? AFAIK you can't be certain a JSON structure is valid until the last byte.
I can't control it but I looked and found a different API that I might be able to handle without any extra help as the response is short. Thanks tho 
I know the connection also wearing that t-shirt)), Just wander how many of us also know it 
For the booking emails part, this could be really easily done in vba without the need of including python. I know you say you record macro's but if you looked into outlook vba you will see you can easily pull save the attachments from an email, then create a new one and send it to a saved address. This can then be activated in a rule so on receipt of an email from x address with x in title do this macro. I can help with the specifics if you want to pm me
Incredibly on point. You can meet people on senior positions coding as if they started three months ago and people who never had an IT job coding as experienced professionals should
When you write a new function, write a test for it. Write multiple tests that cover tricky cases and that cover all paths (should indicate that you want to minimise the number of if statements). This should force you to encapsulate as much as possible and result in lots of small, simple tests and functions. 
I know that, my wife is a programmer and she is way more successful then me)) just told that was hoping for getting some attention..Thanks for the advice. Because English is my second language that is good to know stuff like that.
TDD is not something I see as a very strict requirement. I've written a few libraries where "proper" tests would be an order of magnitude more to write than the rest of the code. Sometimes you have to make the decision to use different methods that fit the situation and save you time. For example, I've written about 5 libraries that control hardware. A few have been simple (servos) and the underlying hardware behavior could be mocked in less than an hour. TDD is a good choice the. Others were for controlling incredibly complex, stateful equipment with over 1000 possible commands, file systems, and endless configurations. In those cases we figure running through functional tests before each release is more appropriate. We still have a lot of tests, but they aren't written up front nor are they run continuously. I'd amend your statement to say that a professional developer chooses the right tool for the job, and most of the time the right tool for the job is TDD.

Glad it helped. Have a good one
Effective communication. * with clients to gather requirements. * with your management to refine those requirements and organize them into an implementation plan. * with team members to delegate work and solve problems. * in your code through good names and organization (code organization is all about communicating with other devs, not the computer). * in your code through clean and simple implementations that require few comments to be understood. * through documentation.
What are you trying to achieve here? The link you provided is for frontend development and has nothing to do with Python..
I recommend this an option for you: https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Python-Specific-Software-Development/dp/0134034287
I want to construct form data from html source. For example: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7c9989aaa5da10183957eb35a70d10dc 
I've read numerous python related books but this one is in a class of it's own, highly recommended: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22800567-fluent-python
An amateur is a "python programmer". A professional is a "programmer".
You can use regex to extract data from form or better, use an HTML parser and extract values from the HTML tree. However, if you want to get the data dynamically, it is not going to work without JS. Typically if you want to get data from form submission, you should create an endpoint and access the POST data from the resource. 
I hope the first one here is the amateur one and the exploratory/refactoring is the professional...because that's how it should work.
Thank you, i know that, here's rewriten question: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/7kl9in/is_there_a_library_that_parses_htmlform_and/
&gt;Another big thing is naming of variables and classes and keeping to pep8. I actually think this is the least important part of a clean code base. Sure, camelCase and PEP8 violations setsOff programmer's OCD impulses which is annoying, but in terms of maintainability loose coupling, DRY, high cohesion, fail-fast code and realistic tests are all *way* more important. With regards to naming, maintainability is aided more by having names that are disambiguated and clear. inactivePayrollEmployee is a LOT better than "p_emp", even if the former does make you itch.
If you that you might need to also do: submenu_by_menu_name = {k: v for k, v in menu} and use that for the lookup. It works but it’s not nearly as elegant. It gets worse if you add more feature like filtering the menu based on permissions. 
Yes, you should use cgi.FieldStorge https://docs.python.org/2/library/cgi.html to parse formdata. Juste make sure to set @cgi.os.environ['REQUEST_METHOD']@ to "POST".
Hi :) You can achieve this with almost any programming language: Python, Ruby, Java, JavaScript, whatever you like. In your case Python is a great choice. If you are starting from zero, it will take some time and frustration to get to the point where you automate the entire process. Be prepared for that. You should also consider that IT tools allow you simplify the process or add new steps, as you see fit. Start learning Python, get comfortable with it. Try databases and a couple of frameworks, then go for it. Proceed slowly, use tests and break large task into smaller pieces or scripts.
Check [this](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_cgi_programming.htm) out. Most of the framework out there, use cgi to parse http request. Hope it helps
&gt; With regards to naming, maintainability is aided more by having names that are disambiguated and clear. inactivePayrollEmployee is a LOT better than "p_emp", even if looking at the former does make you twitch. I agree. Just mean more, the difference between most amateur python programmers is cleanliness in a lot cases. Like the base level coding in Python is super easy, I think having clear names and something that conforms to conventions is a massive deal. &gt; I actually ask at every new company I interview at what qualities they consider important for good code and if stuff like PEP8 features too prominently in their answer that's a massive red flag. Well I would be the opposite, most devs that I get in my place don't even know what PEP8 is so if someone actually knows what it is at least at the base level I would be a lot happier about their overall suitedness to the role. That being said we have to scrape pretty low for our Python developers (not me, they pay me pretty well) because of the financial institutions taking them all so we mostly get people who are using it like a scripting language rather than a proper full on language. If they know what PEP8 is they know at least that there is a style guide and if their CV is decent enough we can teach them TDD (which we use) and objects, our own created libraries...etc. All that being said that's just this place. 
&gt;For example, I've written about 5 libraries that control hardware. A few have been simple (servos) and the underlying hardware behavior could be mocked in less than an hour. TDD is a good choice the. Others were for controlling incredibly complex, stateful equipment with over 1000 possible commands, file systems, and endless configurations. In those cases we figure running through functional tests before each release is more appropriate. We still have a lot of tests, but they aren't written up front nor are they run continuously. Code that communicates with hardware (or indeed anything else, but it's pretty much always hardware) that is hard to mock is the one area where I would argue that the TDD investment doesn't pay off. In such cases I usually try to create a very simple facade that talks to the hardware, that *is* easily mocked and then TDD the more complex algorithmic code that talks to it against that mock. All the same, about 98% of the code I write is TDD'ed.
Fluent Python is a must read. It completely opened up the possibilities of Python for me.
I've been a dev for ... well, many years. Never did python. THAT TALK I listen to over and over, because the ideas there are so well presented. And, I started python. Mainly because of that talk, but other reasons too.
Using getters and setters instead of @property decorators. 
&gt; but in terms of maintainability loose coupling, DRY, high cohesion, fail-fast code and realistic tests are all way more important. I would say "differently important", or perhaps important in a different context. Reading code efficiently is all about minimizing the "mapping" of the words, to the meaning, in your brain. The annoyance you mention is the symptom of an impedance mismatch in that brain mapping function. In the grand scheme of things, yes, the things you mention may have more bearing on the outcome, but the gradual accumulation of all the syntax and standards violations nits can eventually overwhelm even that. 
You have to see the monkey!! ;)
 Here is a little code snipped import cgi def parse_form_data(formdata): fp = cgi.StringIO(formdata) env = cgi.os.environ env['REQUEST_METHOD'] = 'POST' data = cgi.FieldStorage(fp, environ=env) return data You check this [gist](https://gist.github.com/josuebrunel/3e9e421333a27902656ed7e0b776e7c8) out. Hope it helps 
I did just take a look at the README and the first thing I saw: Please provide a requirements.txt. It's kinda good style. If you are in your venv go for "pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt". Then people can install everything with "pip install -r requirements.txt". 
so you're saying it's good for big data while the alternatives (e.g. Excel) are not as good ?
Don't tell him the secret!
Yup. Or, to avoid the, erm, _cynical capitalist_ slant of that, professionalism is when other people are willing to work with you. There's a lot of focus on, um, _testing_ here, but that's missing the point IMO. You can do as much testing and class arranging as you want, but if you're too abrasive or disorganised for others to effectively team with you, you're not much of a professional. And, on the other hand, if you're the person who keeps the entire team cohesive and stay on target, you're professional regardless of whether your code is all that great. Of course people might also be willing to work with you because you're their nephew. What can I say, people are terrible sometimes.
huh ? how ?
I am open to any framework (Django, node.js etc) and will build my backend accordingly. Here's what I was looking for. A skeleton framework that includes below - A sample login portal (Front end, bootstrap would do) - Backend code to handle sign up to create new accounts, storing password in db, handling password resets etc (preferably python, others would do too). Just trying not to reinvent if someone has the code. I will then glue my real backend once I have this ready.
R is not general purpose like Python right ? like you can't do web dev, networking stuff with R right ?
seems like this is the one :) Starting right after the finals. pdf file if someone is interested: http://1.droppdf.com/files/X06AR/fluent-python-2015-.pdf
Thanks for pointing the cgi. But in your example, the input is: fdata = 'user=toto&amp;pass=toto' And in my case, the input is html form element(raw html). And the output should be: fdata = 'user=toto&amp;pass=toto'
https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7c9989aaa5da10183957eb35a70d10dc
Indeed.
AFAIK, we only actually found one, though I forget what in.
Agreed. Except, I've never liked cmd or PS. I use WSL instead. And I use a terminal emulator which gives me nice powerline fonts and colors. Hence problem solved. I absolutely love Pipenv tho. 
I’m working on a version of Siri made in Python. I call it Piri. At the moment it can do math, flip a coin, and give a random number
Thanks, it has been done
Well, that's certainly the most often accessed python resource in the world. All "pip ..." commands deal with it. https://pypi.python.org/pypi
I thought getters and setters were more of a JAVA thing. 
Actually every time you run a `pip` command you use this wharehouse. 
Any language without significant whitespace that has proper OOP, lexical scoping, closures, lambdas, constants, immutability and non-shitty tools.

It's fantastic, the author has done a bunch of videos too: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Luciano+Ramalho
I would tend to disagree with that sentiment. Yes, for a non-Python programmer, having explicit getters/setters may make more sense. However, that’s a distinctly non-Pythonic pattern. Having decorators is a powerful thing that is convenient and leads to cleaner code. Python provides method and function decorators for that specific purpose. Sure, if I wanted to explicitly write an __enter__ and __exit__ in my ClassWithContext I could, and there are certain use-cases for that, but I could also just import contextlib. A simple decorator does the work for me, and someone else reading my code doesn’t need to bother with making sure I implemented the pattern correctly, since it’s now managed by the interpreter. The same could be said for @property
The goat book is pretty good - http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000754
Ok i see. You will need to parse the html with [beautifulsoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) then extract the data you want and encode them. May i ask what is the big picture of your projects ?
Heres even better question: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/7klp62/constructing_the_form_data_set_from_html_in_python/ Big picture of the project is to provide a library that will do all of this automatically.
There is no right answer, but writing logs and unit tests for you modules is a big deal.
I use it to control Matlab and multiple other windows apps.
You can use a facebook bot instead, right? and you don't need a phone (since in MX we have whatsapp, FB and twitter "free")
Bokeh.
The amateur doesn't have a deadline and he has time to design his architecture properly. The professional one has to use any possible mean to finish the app at the given date, even if it's totally dirty and undocumented. Oh, and the amateur has passion. Mostly because he's not reduced to salaryman slavery and he doesn't have to track every single bug for years.
Sorta. You can do things like make a web app with Shiny, which is front-end, something Python can't really do, but I would imagine doing back end server stuff with R would be miserable. Shiny's fairly scoped to visualization of data, so if you wanted to build a full web stack, you'd need JS at some point. Also general purpose scripting is much more suited to python. IMHO Python has been eating R's lunch (and Matlab as well) in the data analysis domain as of late. 
WTForms maybe?
For starters, only amateurs call themselves "Python programmers" (or Java, C, etc.). Professional software developers look at languages as tools to solve problems. Even if you use one more than others, you shouldn't view yourself as a being stuck with one tool. 
I should have clarified, I meant the website itself was rather new to me. I didn't know there was another portal. I have always used the link you gave. That's cool to know both portals rely on the same index basically.
You can do this. You just need to use Jupyter with the root Python environment. I'm able to do this by default. If it helps, I'm using miniconda3. Also, I see you've posted this to the ipython subreddit as well, but these type of questions might be more appropriate for r/learnpython. 
TDD never clicked for me, I think largely because the act of programming is my tool for actually exploring a problem, and I’m never exactly sure what the solution will look like until I’m well into it. I can be pretty obsessive about testing, but post-hoc instead of in advance.
As much as many people hate on vba it still performs much better than python on excel files. Also in most older multinational companies excel is the de facto too for almost anything, not databases as you might expect but excel files. With the arrival of the 365 you can be sure that they will increase their market penetration. I still hope that python gets accepted. It would let me forget vba and use a simpler general purpose language.
\#1 You can go back to what you wrote a year ago and it still makes sense. \#2 Someone else can understand your code. 
I have never, not once in my career, ever seen a planned-out project successfully delivered on time in working condition. It seems to be largely impossible (on budgets not normally reserved for large government projects) to correctly think through *everything* in advance. There’s always a sudden realization about a month in that these 23 components are all really almost the same thing and should be refactored, and oh how that breaks a Gantt chart. I think much more important is to negotiate a set of hard requirements - this thing *must* happen, that thing *must not*, and the other *may* if we need it to - and iterate toward a result that testably meets them. In other words, a good PM will tell devs how the final deliverable must behave, not what it looks like behind the curtains. Frankly, I’ve never seen a single example of the latter actually work.
Pardon me. I didn't know this was currently a feature. I'm using miniconda3 as well on Windows 10. It's never allowed me to do this. Do you have to select the kernel explicitly? I'm on the latest version of Jupyter and notebook. Would it work with pipenv? Also, since I didn't know it's an existing feature, I thought it would be more suited here, sorry.
Love the idea. I'm someone who definitely lyric searches new songs. I'd take the next step towards modularizing your session bus' logic. PM me if you have any questions. I may make a pull request here later in the day when I have time with some modifications too to help you get the flow of open source contributions from other users. Keep on grinding!
i've asked myself this question and I think the answer if you understand the internals of it. like Cpython and whats going under the hood
Intermediate Python is pretty good. https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/149055095X/ Python Tricks is great for learning some corner cases of the language you might not have known, buts it's more a collection of "pro tips" than a "traditional book" ... either way it's a great read. https://dbader.org/products/python-tricks-book/
Take into account the title of the thread: "What coding practices **separate** an amateur Python programmer from a professional one?" It asks for practices that are *only* adhered to by professional programmers, whereas your suggestion is adhered to by any somewhat competent programmer regardless of professionalism. Personally I'd go so far as to doubt whether there even is a significant correlation between "writes structured code" and "writes code for money". Either way when reading your comment in the context of the posed question it appears to imply that you only expect professional programmers to structure their code using functions and classes. I'm not saying that's what you meant, but since you asked I'm highlighting the misunderstanding. To give a more exaggerated example: "Professional programmers usually eat at least once a day". Well, yes, but so do most amateur programmers. It is a true statement, but it does not distinguish one group from the other.
Wow thanks for the kind words. I fell in love with the synced lyrics and since musixmatch is no longer available with spotify I wanted to make it happen.Your pull request will be more than welcomed. Im definitely gonna keep on grinding ;)
O’Reilly’s Python Cookbook is a great deep dive - https://www.amazon.com/dp/1449340377/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_TL-nAb7TZFM5V
I really like how simple this and how useful it is. I was planning on doing something with lyrics by checking if the song had any swear words so I could run a check to see if a certain song was safe for school use or not. Great script dude!
This is awesome! I'm a very beginner in python and know only a few basics so looking at this makes me more excited to learn it further! Thanks for sharing.
Not really. F# has a steep learning curve, Python is similar to VBA in the respect that it's relatively easy for non programmers to hack stuff quickly.
https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/books has sections divided by skill.
That's great for a can it be done, however, I had to mimic a spreadsheet, and went with qt in the end, it has a grid widget, that was less than 5 lines. 
Thanks. Im a lazy guy, so I like it simple and easy to understand. 
Does the grid widget include formula evaluation? I'd love to see a comparison.
Did you see https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui/issues/46 and https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui/issues/186 ? Between those two threads, there *may* be alternative solutions.
I'm writing a lightweight OAI-PMH harvester. So far, I've managed to get the data into local files in under 20 lines of code. Next step is to transform it on the fly into csv files for data analysis. Fun little project.
I did take into account the title of the thread, though. It doesn't ask for practices that are *only* adhered to by professional programmers. It asks what *separates* them, as you yourself emphasized. To me, this reads as asking what features differ between the two groups. What I pointed out generally does, which makes it a valid answer. In any case, I appreciate your feedback. I just don't understand why the word "only" is being injected into the question when it doesn't appear in the original wording.
No, like all gui components you can assign what you want to it, calculations are done in the background, I only needed it to display rows of data as they were entered into a form, but the grid is interactive, so bits can be selected and de selected, as for snazzy stuff like auto incriminating, I'm not sure how possible that is in python, it is a C++ library after all. 
So I really wanted to use tkinter, but i can't seem to find tk for windows with a commercial use license :(
You shouldn't be using it to call out to the shell. That's really bad practice. Please just use it to call a process directly, i.e., an OO wrapper to the `execve` syscall. Rule of thumb, **you do not know how to build safe shell command lines**, *ever*.
Very nicely done. The calculation chain build out is a favorite interview question of mine. As a personal preference, I like separating the propagate and calculate more explicitly: build up all of the dependencies in the chain, then eval the entire chain. This avoids redundant calculations, with the added bonus of revealing circular dependencies.
I just used tkinter because it's in the standard library. I think Qt is more commercial friendly.
On one hand, I would take exception to this as I absolutely consider myself a "Python programmer" first an foremost. On the other, I've been writing Ruby for the past year because that's the right tool for the job at the moment, and I'm definitely not afraid to pick up new languages.
Call `pg_dump` to dump your database schema à la Rails `db:structure:dump`, call `libreoffice` to convert Wind-blows documents to HTML for processing, call `ffmpeg` to start an RTP stream, call `xclip` to put things in the clipboard instead of trying to find some out-of-date Xlib wrapper, call `rsync` from a GUI wrapper, etc.
I just used tkinter because it's in the standard library. I think Qt is more commercial friendly.
Fair point and I totally agree with you. I think it's unlikely that Microsoft will drop VBA completely from Office applications in favour of Python any time soon. So by implementing F# they'll give more flexibility to power users, and considering its part of .NET it wouldn't be as difficult to support. Either way, having a faster and more modern scripting language built into office applications would be fantastic (I write a lot of VBA for a living, please save me).
I love tkinter. Just frustrated I can't use it
This feedback is in no way constructive nor welcome. 
You shouldn't. It'd be like a construction worker calling himself a "hammer worker" or a "driller". What's being built is what's most important, not what is being used.
Yep, it's something that comes under the auspices of the [Python Packaging Authority](https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/).
I have read a couple of python books recently and I can only agree, this is by far my favorite. You'll feel like a python master once you get through this one. 
I like this too, but Fluent Python was more thorough. 
I really liked "Idiomatic Python"
No. How to invoke python, do a calculation, and get an answer from a user entered field in a browser. 
I would recommend [Test Driven Development: By Example ](https://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Kent-Beck/dp/0321146530) by Kent Beck. It is a quite short read, and a very good one.
You might consider [wxPython](https://wxpython.org/Phoenix/docs/html/). I'm hoping that the full release of this means a boost for [Dabo](https://dabodev.com/).
What? 
That’s pretty much what everyone added eventually. Sorry to have pinged you - I should’ve given the community more time to manifest. Hope you have a great day.
1. Don't do that 2. My guess is that the underlying contents of the module (i.e. Files on disk, perhaps compounded by the fact that it's a builtin) didn't change, so the interpreter short-circuited the reload and returned back the same object, which you altered. This is just a guess though. But again, see #1, and you'll never have to worry about something like this. 
Isn't plotly a paid service? 
Yes, this book is a fantastic way to delve deeper into Python!
Fluent Python was the first one that came to my mind as well. Fantastic book.
It essentially has a BSD license I'm not sure what the problem would be using it commercially.

TK is open source. If you find me a way to install it on modern Windows with the same licence, I'll be thrilled. All the Windows compatible builds are commercial distributions and I was unable to make my own
thank you...pyramid deserves to be more popular

The first 2/3 of Fluent Python are a must read for beginners looking to advance.

I admire your bravery posting that indeed in the Python subreddit :) No, whilst C# is okay, some projects are just better suited. But being a large company, I think it is a good question of management to ask "yeah, this new technology, isn't it ok to use our existing tools with VBA and C#? AND THEY ASK THIS TO MICROSOFT", of course they will respond "yes sir, don't bother buying new stuff for this new language, it doesn't scale well, it has no compiler! THE HORROR" Story of my life. Meanwhile I am trying to code stuff that is a oneliner in pandas.
I would suggest using `argparse` to parse arguments too instead of going manually through `sys.argv`.
I use it a lot in Django in the form of Mixins to reuse functionality. When you understand multiple inheritance, it becomes a really powerful tool. By the way: class A(object): def __init__(self): super(A, self).__init__() self.aData = "a" def f(self): return self.aData class B(object): def __init__(self): super(B, self).__init__() self.bData = "b" def g(self): return self.bData class C(A, B): pass
The style you are talking about looks like a "mixin". A mixin is a pattern allows the derived class inherit features from multiple mixin classes usually to enhance or add optional features. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/533631/what-is-a-mixin-and-why-are-they-useful
thanks. i got it working with pywinauto.
cool I knew there must have been a name for it but wasn't sure what it was! "Mixin".
cool I was looking for the name of this type of inheritance. "mixin", thanks!
Try Connect 4. Slightly difficult that T3. 
Tkinter is released under the Python license and works on Windows - I use it for my apps. It compiles fine with py2exe. What are you looking for specifically?
The hate in your Quran is reflected upon you, the fate of your ancestors will happen again. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJqk8-GWBkU It's no longer a discussion at this point. Your appeals for peace will used against you. 
Yeah, with Linux the task could be easy. Wonder if there are Mac/Windows ways too. 
We will call the better implementation as UnDict.
I think test driven development should encompass writing code that is easy to test versus writing a failing test first. Writing code that is testable is how I design my programs. It doesn't really when you write the actual test, only that you write it.
Django, comes with login, admin, already. 
&gt;Python projects use dictionaries liberally for data processing. In C# I would make a class to handle data, and stringly typed dictionaries are frowned upon as an unmaintainable mess of spaghetti code. I use a lot of numpy and pandas and it uses a dictionary like structure designed to work well for data processing. I can't see how implementing a different class for each data processing project you have would help here. Python is not statically typed but in general all most used libraries have a very good documentation, also some tools like jedi can process the functions to track what's being returned. Maybe if you use an IDE this transition will be a little bit easier. In general, python is different but very pragmatic. A lot of concepts forced by other languages like C# or Java are optional in Python, the faster you embrace these differences the faster you will be a happy pythonist. If you're beginning in Python maybe it's a good idea to start with an IDE like PyCharm.
sounds like you are shit out of luck. What crypto/wallet app is asking for this password?
You can (and should) create classes for your data, I do it all the time, namedtuples are very good for that, and if you need mutation, try attrs. You can (and should) document your methods with types and descriptions, and you can also use type hinting if you're using python 3 (which I really hope you are, for your own good) That said, I understand your pain. You're moving into a quite different world, and you're gonna have to learn a quite different way of thinking about stuff. Try to look at things from a fresh perspective, and maybe look into more advanced features of python (descriptors, decorators, meta programming, etc); hopefully they are interesting and useful enough to offset the stuff you miss from C# Or you can just go back to c#, or move into android, or some other language more similar to C#. Nothing wrong with that. Last, but not least, it might be that python is a bad option to the problem you're solving. In which case, good luck, it's always very hard to convince management to completely switch technologies like that =(
I think they're looking for a link. Shouldn't tk be available on Python's website? 
Do not keep order after deletion seems seird, sorry. This is another special case to remember, and it's extremely counterintuitive. Too bad, I remember that Guido van Rossum once said that the deletion had to preserve the order: https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2017-November/150381.html
I'm using PyCharm, and sometimes it helps with figuring out the functions a module gives me, but for the most part it can't help me figure out the members of a dictionary; for that, I'm stuck reading through all the code or running it. Having data classes would help me easily access the members of the data object being returned, keeping me from misspelling the keys or using a key that no longer exists on the object due to an upgraded dependency. With the dictionary you just have to run it and hit the runtime error.
The funny thing is that management mostly agrees with me here, it's an off-the-reservation senior Python dev that won't budge.

Did you install python with activestate? It's not in the default python36 install last I checked. And activestate is non commercial
I feel your pain. I don't write so much but I do have a couple of VBA apps I still support. But then some people are still supporting Fortran and Cobol - languages never die!
Until it becomes obsolete and you're using outdated tech. 
tkinter has been in the standard Python distribution on Windows for the 17 years that I've been using the language. Without it you won't get IDLE.
If you're familiar with some basics of formal languages and automata theory, consider using this: http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/.
If you think you can convince people, go for it. Fitness to purpose is a hard to define thing, though. There a lot of reasons to stick to a language, and "stuff is already written in it" is actually a pretty good one. And as a counterpoint, I own a reasonably large code base in Python and I don't see most of the issues you're talking about. I mean, we have them, mostly in old code, but new code is documented and tested and the architecture is discussed before jumping into implementation, so, it's usually nice to work with.

Feedback Requested: I have not released it yet, but would like to hear what people think of the site(usability, design, etc). It will not work on mobile yet, or any browser that does not support webms. Comments: To use it, select clips and add a youtube URL for audio. It will use the clips and the song you provided to make a music video for you. If you make an account you can upload your own clips from your PC or from a URL link.

&gt;Python projects use dictionaries liberally for data processing. In C# I would make a class to handle data, and stringly typed dictionaries are frowned upon as an unmaintainable mess of spaghetti code. I usually do the latter for prototyping because it's quicker and then refactor into the former once the project grows. I frown upon this stuff in python too. &gt;I can't tell what any methods are going to return to me. I'm forced to read all the code, which sometimes fails because the response of an HTTP request is being packed into a dictionary, so the only fallback is to actually spin up an environment and run the code I'm using to see what it gives me. I'm not sure how everybody else deals with this but I write tests which spin up an environment and set off an http request and then stick an ipython embed in the code and have a look around. I don't really see it as something I have to fall back to because it all takes one (usually quick) step.
 try: subprocess.check_call(["wget", "--read-timeout=30", data["download_url"] , "-O", outputfolder+data["patent_id"]+".pdf"]) except CalledProcessError as e: print e.message

Thank you for sharing. Today I learned about Spotify's dbus interface through your code. :)
Surely a tool like PyCharm enables you to run the linter of your choice when you save your code? That alone saves a lot of the frustration involved with hitting runtime errors.
Pipfile with pipenv is better 🙂
Have you considered that it might be screwing up at the report end instead? import requests your_url = 'whatever.com/pix?1451&amp;param=blah' requests.get(your_url) definitely triggers an http request for me. Maybe you can sniff traffic or something?
Never seen it called chutes instead of snakes. Is this USA thing?
It runs a linter in itself, but I think we're all aware that a linter can't catch an attempted dictionary key access if the key isn't present.
I wholeheartedly support that process. If you know you're going to have to test it later, you tend to make your functions easy to test. Strictly speaking, though, TDD means writing tests first. That's a process that just doesn't work for me.
Much of my problem is actually taking this senior dev's word as law since this is the first time I've worked with someone on Python at a professional level. I think you could help either validate the decisions being made, or give me a better angle to argue my case to this senior developer. And I'm not trying to rip the project apart and get it written in **My Favorite Language TM**, I want to be open to the styles of different programming languages, I just can't believe anyone runs code like I'm seeing at production level, or how anyone is able to work on this code except for the person that wrote it.
I've been told that introducing DTO classes with just increase the amount of code we have to maintain, without solving any real problem because the current situation isn't a problem. We do have a lot of API tests, and I guess I have to get more comfortable reading their output or constantly referring to our Swagger docs (that the senior dev hand-wrote). The `**kwargs` are the least of my problems, it seems they're mostly used in wrapper methods to decrease coupling.
Thanks. That's not quite what I'm looking for. Glowscript seems perfect...write in python, get back javascript code to paste in a browser and you never have to mess with JS. But I don't see that GS allows for the input of a number and the report back of the evaluation of a function. It's aiming at vpython and interactivity with graphics, which is great. Just not what I need...which seems much simpler, but not obvious. What I'd like to be able to do is roll my own like here: http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Relativ/ltrans.html#c4 but without having to write javascript. Rather, I'd like to use a more programming language. Again...GS seems perfect, but it doesn't seem to do interactivity like this.

pypi.python.org is the older site. Warehouse (pypi.org) is still in development, and it's supposed to take over as the main site when it's fully ready. It's a more modern web app that should be easier to maintain.
use mock library: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html
1: read the sidebar 2: /r/learnpython 3: read the sidebar
Note that you shouldn't follow TDD religiously. Make sure you have a bunch of use cases finished then implement a full testing suite. Rewriting tests frequently is extremely hampering early on in a project.
&gt; auto incriminating Fortunately, that isn't possible in Python
Yes - you've seen it: Not only is python inherently unsafe but it the culture around it often encourages bad patterns - for example today a developer who should know better was suggesting that a "get food" function should return None instead of raising an error in the case that it failed. Python is full of this kind of crazy magic in which literally anything can happen at any time.
This kind of excitement will serve you really well as you learn I think. Stay hungry man. 
That is seriously fucking awesome. I love it!
Sure but it can catch all those mistyped names. Why the fixation with dictionary keys anyhow, they're not the only Python built-in data type? There are also loads more 3rd party ones available from pypi and/or github?
&gt;I've been told that introducing DTO classes with just increase the amount of code we have to maintain, without solving any real problem because the current situation isn't a problem. I doubt that it would actually mean a lot more code, but It's entirely possible that the effort required is not worth the expense. I always take the approach of looking at the bugs reported from prod and QA and see how your code can be modified to prevent them in future. If you're getting ValueErrors and key not found's from production that sends a very strong signal that you can prevent those bugs in future by changing stringly typed dicts to classes. If not, well... maybe it's not such a big deal. 
PMed you :)
&gt; Not only is python inherently unsafe Please provide the citations to back up that claim. 
Oh. Sounds like you might be working with a Bad Person™®©. I don't have much to say about that, sorry. What I can say is that the agile manifest wasn't talking about docstrings when it said we should value working software over documentation. Docstrings (or their equivalent) are pretty essential in any language, even the ones with the most complete and advanced type systems. Sure, code should be self explanatory, but docstrings are about what the code is for, not how it works. And comments are for why's: to document unusual decision required by constraints (of time, design, integration, environment, etc). 
Can someone tell me what I might do to get a machine learning agent to follow the words in the songs automatically not just the lines? Would really appreciate some guidance on this!
Did you read about how the basis of my problem is that the project I'm working on uses dictionaries all over the API's view layer? It seems like you didn't read my post.
I recently found a library called "parsley" and its great for this kind of thing, thanks for the resource though
Yes we use the mock library but that is aside my question
How about a "naughty or nice" detector?
And make those tests auto-discoverable
If you use the [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/), there's a [plugin](https://github.com/UnitedIncome/serverless-python-requirements) that handles all of this for you automatically. I wrote a [blog post](https://serverless.com/blog/serverless-python-packaging/) on using it to handle your Python dependencies. If you want something standalone, that's cool too :). You can see how the plugin works -- basically, it mounts a Docker container with an image very similar to the Lambda environment for compiling the packages. It could be worth emulating, though it would require Docker for your users.
Amateur: writes scripts and then backs them with libraries. Professional: same thing, but replace script with unit test.
Oh nice. This is exactly what I had in mind. Thank you!

Learn Python3 the hard way - Zed A. Shaw
Network security is mostly unrelated to language and Python does'nt add anything unexpected to the work but you can see some of the types of problems being searched for in tools like this: https://github.com/python-security/pyt Also, you will get better answers if you are a bit more specific about what risks you securing against.
The part I’m most excited about is that I’ve never seen the Pyautogui library before. 
I agree with you. If something doesn’t maintain state then it shouldn’t be a class. What does instantiating it even do to improve things? It’s not doing anything!
Classes for the sake of classes is pointless, and doesn't help testability at all. If you have state (or are passing around objects that you're mutating with your functions), or if you're doing doing pseudo polymorphism by dispatching to your functions based on isinstance or whatever... then you may benefit from classes. Especially if your functions are very... functional (e.g. stateless, no embedded io, accept parameters and output something else), it may just be making the code worse. Though it really depends on the specifics

Fluent Python is fantastic! Is Effective Python worth buying in addition?
The best 2 Python books: Fluent Python (By Luciano Ramano) and Python Essential Reference (by david Beazley)
Rust! https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2017/11/16/speed-python-using-rust/ and http://github.com/rochacbruno/py2rs
Great! You're welcome
I use keyboard macros for gaming that have a similar end-result.
Understood, thank you. 
Pretty sure that's gonna be potentially undecidable. You would have to detect infinite loops, otherwise your program won't stop either, and that kinda means solving the halting problem, which is basically not possible.
The Python Standard Library by Example. Available on Kindle. 
The Steps are 1) every letter is converted to lower case 2) Most punctuation is removed 3) All vowels are removed and the constants are scrambled in each word. Because of 1 &amp; 2 it would be difficult automatically to identify the start and end of sentences - and generally it is not easy to identify and replace missing punctuation anyway. Leaving aside the punctuation - step 3 is the most problematic to be frank; the only way I can see to decode the message would be to take every 'coded' word - try all possible orderings of those words - and see if any ordering matches a dictionary word. And you could easily hit an issue as you are likely to hit multiple words - even simple 'words' such as 'y' will match 'eye', 'you' and 'aye'. Essentially since the 'encryption' is non-deterministic it is not really encryption - and any decryption attempt will only be as good as your dictionary. Good luck
I just recreated this program! It never ends, though - do not recommend. 
Source?? 
This is no different than solving IP routing problems. The halting problem is a fundamentally different problem than a graph traversal one. In this particular case, you stop enumerating the moment you get a cycle. Also, the idea I'm proposing is code paths in an application run loop (for instance on a web server or any other event driven application). These things simply don't work if the code doesn't complete "most" of the time, and are immediately visible to the end user (in the form of hangs) when they don't work.
This is great
Hmm. I am not great at this part of computer science, but I guess I see what you're saying? Anyway, for the practical aspect of it, you could look at the ast module. It allows you parse a module into an abstract sintax tree and them traverse. For what you wanna do, the NodeVisitor is probably where you wanna start. You probably can use it to build some graph data structure (maybe using graphviz?) then apply your ideas to analize the execution paths.
Yeah, if would be better to do while True: for item in range(0,100): pyautogui.click(x,y) time.sleep(0.2) time.sleep(10) that way every 100 swipes you get a 10 second window to exit if you want.
The GIF. It's like 5 lines of code. 
One interesting application (and by interesting I mean I'd like if this existed but I'm not up for building it) would be analizing twisted apps to find shit that might block the reactor.
He's not trying to determine if the program will ever stop executing, therefore there's no issue with the halting problem. He's trying to make a diagram of function calls in the program.
Python is a language for consenting adults so nothing is hidden and you should expect to read the docstrings and code to know what it’s doing. Most widely used libraries have good reference documentation. In a REPL shell do `help(foo.BarClass)` to print the docstring. This works with class members too. Dictionaries are fine for passing around data. Use a class when you wan to couple data and behavior. Use a namedtuple when you want the data to be immutable or you want to ensure the presence of specific keys. Using `*args` and `**kwargs` isn’t much different from variable parameters in C#. It should be used sparingly for cases where it makes sense and not as a default style. The docstring should list the optimal arguments. More generally, you should write Python like Python and not like C# or Java. Class hierarchies, interfaces, private members, and reliance on compiler type checking are not very Pythonic. There are different approaches to accomplish the same goals, and that’s the part you’ll need to get used to.
Can't you just keyboard interrupt?

Got it, thanks for the answer!
I’ll watch it on my computer I’m driving and can’t really see it on my phone
Nah, you just need to enclose your loop in: try ... except KeyboardInterrupt: pass 
That's not a full sentence. 
Now you need machine learning to determine the attractiveness of the picture.
Can't you just stop? Same structure. Complete sentence.
I've been programming Python for 3 years and didn't know this existed. Given, I mostly do ETL and data science, so it doesn't come up as much
Hour 2. This is going to be *so* much fun. &gt; At present, MULTI is not compatible with Python 2.4 and later because many changes, including syntax extensions, have been incorporated. For example, the following syntax: &gt; from module import (name1, name2) &gt; is new in Python 2.4 and is used in basic modules such as os.py. MULTI will be integrated with a newer Python release in the future. 
It is
Dude just wants to be pandentic... you could have literally typed "Keyboard interrupt?"and the intended message would have been still conveyed.
Bruh, have fun
Use some rand() statements so they don't think it's automated.
Maybe check it out from the library so you can skim it. I'm fairly sure Fluent Python covers all the things that Effective Python does, but Effective Python is great at delivering 57 specific ways to write Pythonic code in a much shorter book. If you haven't read either, I'd recommend Effective Python first since you'll learn more in a shorter amount of time. Fluent Python is great, but it's also a huge tome.

I think the last time someone tried that it ended up pretty racist...
Not python, but here’s a project that did that: https://github.com/crockpotveggies/tinderbox
Genius.
why the `if 1 * 2 &lt; 3` ?
Haha I was having trouble making a code block so I copied the stuff from the Markdown primer (now edited out) :)
Well, that's hilarious
I went through some of the chapters of Automate the Boring Stuff, and I've always used Selenium for stuff like that. Is pyautogui better? 
It is because "keyboard interrupt" is a verb
"Can't you just noun?" Nope, my skills are far below "keyboard interrupt", and with the mouse click click clicking I couldn't google ways to make the program quit. It was a hard few minutes. 
I'm still at the point of figuring out if what I'm looking at is Python or if it's someone being lazy and only serving himself with the project. You've given me examples of non-pythonic code. Can you give some examples (or link something on github) of pythonic code? I really want to know what good Python looks like, and the difference between it and this project I'm currently struggling with. You guys keep mentioning docstrings; I think the fact that this project is not allowed to have comments, and that "we should build working code over documentation," point to a project that is comfortable for the one person that built it, and resistant to collaboration by people under the skill level of the creator. 
&gt; Tinderbox will examine previous likes/dislikes and develop a model based on colors found within faces of profiles. Would be even better if the model used can evaluate facial features and proportions more generally, as oppose to just colors.
Beauty is cultural. That doesn’t make it racist. 
Selenium is probably better for this case. It's directly aware of web elements and their attributes. With PyAutoGUI it would be harder to do things like reliable element detections and text extraction, for example.
The "all execution paths" confused me, but he explained it more, below, and I think I got it.
Was this comment created with pyautogui ?
Huh.
Just downloaded Python on my Mac! Looking forward to spending a lot of time on it! (New to programming) Any comments, tips etc. will deeply be appreciate! 
I think that library would make it difficult to send an interrupt to the terminal. It would keep putting focus on the window at x, y.
favorite data science blog or learning resource?
The part I'm impressed is he got some matches.
The web server could trivially detect selenium. This is clearly in violation of the site's TOS so you may not get far advertising so much. Using a gui automation toolkit keeps the browser naive and therefore makes detection much harder.. Except for the 300 clicks per minute on the exact same pixel. 
Al Sweigart would be proud (?)
I knew it
I am sorry you get downvoted
you can tell the student login prompt is real because he's using python3
It doesn't make any difference You can do import module test(module.func1) Or from module import Module test(Module().func1) Obviously that's not how you'd write a test, but it gets my point across. There's nothing to be gained. A module IS a class. You can even store state in it (I think) if you have no morals.
Japanese people used to think blackened teeth were beautiful. Does that help you understand? Beauty is a cultural thing. That does not make it racist. You aren’t applying negative racial attributes to somebody you don’t find beautiful. You simply don’t want to breed with them. Why is that hard to understand?
I actually made a project a while ago that used Python with ADB to swipe left/right on Tinder depending on the amount of people in the photo. I put up a [tutorial on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WIrxGn3H9o) and the project on [Github](https://github.com/theriley106/TwoFaced).
I write [prysm](https://github.com/brandondube/prysm) which is an optical simulation library written in python. I'm not sure I'd call it a standout by any means, but it's a thing, has quite a few features, is mostly numpy based, and is pretty fast.
Same as u/lookingforsome1 I know there are a lot of resources out there. But still I would like to listen to your guidance. What are the real resources that apply to your job scope?
Since discovering the library attrs, I've become a great fan of using classes to model data. The up and coming dataclasses feature within python 3.7 (with a backport to 3.6) has me salivating. Here is Raymond's slides https://www.dropbox.com/s/cxxz4d2hwj4hm4d/HettingerHolidaySF2017.pdf that talks about its memory and speed advantages as well as the advantages of better data validation, type casting as well as problem restructuring. Attrs works for python as well as 3. I've been using it within some recent code development projects and that has made me a believer in this concept. No going back to dicts or named tuples (the latter has performance as well as pickling issues). I will use an attrs decorated data handling class any day over a namedtuple. Its burned in my mind after having had to back out a ton of namedtuples from some data base retrieval code) This link describes the data management wins wrt using Attrs. https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2016/08/attrs.html This poster had the same ahah! reaction that I did to using classes to manage data structures. https://codeyarns.com/2016/09/07/attrs-package-in-python/ So don't be too quick to give up on python just yet! 
Take this with a grain of salt, but I'd extensively test the pure functions and then use an integration test without mock to make sure the right routes get called. Like, did I get a 200 with a string that contains something I expect.
I mean, I guess if you don't care who you match with.
Couldn't you simply install a windows classic based theme? (If in Windows 8.1/10) Or if in a version before that enable it. A good one for newer Windows versions that don't have it can be grabbed [here](https://niivu.deviantart.com/art/Classic-714254749).
It's looking for a column called "New Zealand" you specified in double quotes but I think you meant to specify the string 'New Zealand' in single quotes.
Blackened teeth are not a racist standard of beauty, because no one is born with them, and the ability to get them has no racial basis. A lot of physical features that are recognized as beautiful in the West imply a deeply racist cultural standard. 
Why are you doing this? What's wrong with setup.py (and maybe a Makefile with a few one line commands in it for running tests and packaging for pypi)?
how do you know this stuff? a genuine question from super python newbie
Remember what sub you're in
“The west” so other areas of the world aren’t racist with their standards? Are racist against Europeans or do you incorrectly think that other cultures don’t have their own cultural preferences?
So you didn't have a phone handy? How do you not know what a keyboard interrupt is?
I call bullshit. That would only be true if we deliberately *decided* what physical features we find attractive. If you can, fine, congratulations! I at least can't force myself into finding huge butts attractive for instance. That's got nothing to do with racism. I don't like huge butts, no matter what color. That I find pale skin more attractive than dark/black skin is also just attractiveness of a particular feature and has also got nothing to do with racism. 
Good point my presumably low standard Internet friend.
*Leaves conversation.* 
I see stuff like this and keep whacking myself on the head for forgetting; C# has had many of these features since I've started developing professionally! It's weird how far behind Python is, with it only recently getting type annotations. I hope I'll be able to convince the senior dev on my team about these features, usually he makes a convincing argument that it's more work to implement and maintain than it's worth.
Indeed, I think `ast` is probably how I'm going to end up doing this. Btw, the `twisted` use case you mention is very close to what I'm going to use it for. Essentially an audit of things that can be done in an event driven cooperative multitasking application. As I said earlier, it's not so much about the dynamic runtime behaviour as it is about auditing code paths...
Does it play nice when attaching horizontal and vertical scrollbars to it?
do you mean a git server? /r/linuxadmin may be more useful to you.
Based on zero info I'd guess your code is running on only one CPU as is. You probably have more than that. Figure out how to use those first. Optimizing will be 100× faster than using more nodes. Have you profiled your code? Have you used numpy and numba or cython? 
Which stuff? Detecting selenium? The server has access to the requesting client "useragent" which reports browser and operating system. 300 clicks would just be a counter on the API and just monitoring for so many hits on x amount of time. For pixel click, JavaScript can detect dom interaction and use the x and y of the click event within it and record where they clicked. How does one know this? Basic programming exposure. 
What's the other 1/3?
Add using version control to this list and I'm happy.
An algorithm doesn't have a culture.
https://youtu.be/dZLyfbSQPXI?t=673 There's a link to a conference the guy who made/maintains the library gave on it. The first part is about test automation. The part i skipped to is where he talks about GUI automation. You can use it to make web game bots too(which he covers) 
Tkinter doesn't have a scrollable frame, but I'm sure there are workarounds as discussed [on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16188420/python-tkinter-scrollbar-for-frame). This project was more about the calculation logic for me than the actual layout of the spreadsheet UI. I just found Tkinter to be an easy way to get and display a grid of values.
I think the gripe is it doesn't say MIT. If I use this in commercial software I'd rather know right off the bat it's MIT, and list it as such in my 3rd party licenses, than have to match the string mentally.
Programmer here, I'm looking at the source code here and there's a lot of linear algebra and calculus trying to detect circles and symmetry under the shoulders, what could this mean?
I didn't say it was a *deliberately* racist cultural standard. 
https://youtu.be/dZLyfbSQPXI?t=1156 Watch that for about 1 minute. The guy who made it goes over the failsafe built into pyautogui
http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-33347866 It depends how much learning your algorithm gets. For example if you train it only on people, the algorithm may decide that someone is black just from a vague outline and color hue. Then you feed it pictures of animals and it will think a white can is a caucasian baby and a black horse is a black guy, when in fact you shouldn't have trained your algorithm with blacked.com
Arguably you don't find huge butts or dark skin attractive because neither has been constantly advertised to you as your cultural norm of attractive since your birth, and the reasons for *that* are very likely -- if not certainly -- inherently racist. Even your phrase "just attractiveness of a particular feature" implies an absolute standard within a culture... a culture that, from the sounds of it, is at its core defined by its power base (and its PoV on beauty) being both male and white. If you prefer any particular natural shade of skin color, you're racist. This isn't news. We're all racist. Accept this and use it as a yardstick of the failings of your education in avoiding inherent bias, because it's your unwillingness to try a little strange that defines the depth of that racism.
*writes shell script to swipe like a boss; has trouble typing four spaces before each line in his code*
I happen to have personal experience with Western cultural standards. I didn't say a thing about other cultures. 
Beauty is subjective, and is as you rightly pointed out, cultural. When the underlying cultural paradigm is inherently racist, its not hard to see how subjective evaluations of beauty by individuals within that culture are also tinged by racism. For example, see the prevalence of 'fairness creams' in India.
This is not python right?
A hemisphere does not a Europe make. Or a culture. Neither do "Europeans" constitute a race. Or a culture. Also, if the calling out racism inherent in "the West" is itself even potentially racist, then "the West" must be, rather by definition, dominated by one identifiable race, which rather clearly points to its inherent racism in the first place. *All* human cultures are racist, let's just stipulate that and move on ... *not all* human cultures have grabbed the microphone, started screaming into it, and refused to let it go.
I think you win the Internet today.
I did the same thing using adb commands a couple of years ago. This was when there was no concept of Super Likes and daily swipe limits. Surprisingly it worked pretty well then, because tinder was new and didn't restrict such "I lswipe right all behavior". These days profiles that swipe everyone right are ranked pretty low. 
Well, specifically basic web-programming experience. I'm sure there's quite a few embedded sensor programmers who haven't the slightest clue how the browser works, or that mouse tracking is even a thing.
Sorry, absolutely. Kiddo was up to being a kiddo and I was distracted. 
Perhaps women have some sort of round, symmetrical, fleshy mounds on their chest that men subconsciously find attractive? The world may never know..
I probably won’t get a single match even with this 
Actually same here! That is exciting
I’m excited about author using 4 spaces in terminal 
My guess would be to reorient and centre the face before feeding it into the neural network for classification.
They do that.
Tkinter, python, spreadsheets?! Please stop, i can only get so hard. 
Personally I wonder if it can be run with an Android phone using the adb tool.
I wouldn't call that racism because "racism" implies something bad that I have control over, that I can deliberately decide to follow or not. I don't want to be put into the same box with nazis just because I have some cultural subconscious imprints that keep my body from a sexual reaction on dark skin and/or huge butts. The ultimate cause of this behavior might be considered "racist" and I was too if I deliberately decided not to be attracted by huge butts and/or black women. However, I cannot actively control what I find attractive and what I don't. Of course I can decide what I *think* about black women and huge butts on a totally different level that has got nothing to do with physical attraction. Thoughts and attraction might correlate but there's no direct connection between them. If we follow this path then feeling a stronger sexual attraction by a woman in a sexy outfit compared to a woman in a potato bag will be called "sexist". I think we need a word for cultural stifling and denial of inward emotional reactions (i.e. feelings) that we cannot control. Oh, I might digress a little but isn't this racism, sexism, whateverism debate all about being triggered by some phrasing or behavior? Like, feeling to be personally attacked by something? I feel personally attacked by the racism debate because, like I said above, I don't want to be put into a box with nazis and true racists. I feel personally attacked by the sexism debate because I cannot deny the feelings that I have when I see an attractive woman (whatever "attractive" might mean). I can deliberately *act* upon them but I feel like my possibilities of acting are restricted further and further by calling everything "sexist" that in any way, shape or form points towards wanting to have sex with that woman. Even just making compliments today can lead to being accused of sexual harassment. Not saying that it happens in the majority of events but it's definitely a risk that I already start thinking twice about taking. Fortunately I am already married. Otherwise I'd have a tough time today finding a partner when finding a partner bears the risk of losing my mere existence to a witch hunt. Call me paranoid, but isn't that a core aspect of the whole debate that everyone should be able to express their way of living in a free and open manner without being harassed by others? I feel like the debate leads to a way of living freely by stifling the freedoms of others. Sure, I'm *not* asking for the freedom to grab a woman's ass in the wild. I'm asking for the freedom to - in a respectful manner - show her what I'm after so that after all is said and done she doesn't feel utilized and degraded because she knew from the very beginning where things were gonna end up. Isn't that a better way than pretending to want to get to know her in order to only get her into my bed? And how can the latter be considered sexist when it's something that men and women often want? Sometimes I don't want a full blown relationship but just have some fun. How's that sexist? As I said, I digress... but that's what came to my mind thinking about the whole racism and sexism debates and I felt like getting this off my chest on this occasion. And now happy downvoting people! I'm used to getting kicked in the butt for not denying my personality. 
How can something unintentional be "racist"? 
Would spoofing the user agent not solve this problem?
It's a cool tool. I automated part of my job with it.
They are artefacts build by humans trained on data produced by humans. 
Well I mentioned a few things you generally should avoid. Class hierarchies should be used to alter behavior and not to track what things are. For example, don't do things like this everywhere: def foo(a, b): if not isinstance(a, list) or not isinstance(b, list): raise Exception('Not a list') Although it does exist in Python, there's rarely a need to create abstract base classes. Same for hiding the constructor behind a factory function. Although factories are very common, there's no need to prevent people from instantiating or using your classes. Interfaces are a little different. Zope provides an interface-like scheme but it's not widely used nor is it necessary. Consider this example: from foo import Bar `foo.py` is a module and Bar is a class. You can also make `foo` a package and in the `__init__.py` module define symbols to export either using an `__all__` list or by directly import from another module. from .bar import Bar __all__ = ['Bar'] Using it like a library looks the same either way but the advantage is you can define a stable interface in one place and make changes to components inside the package. There's no compiler or runtime enforcement of the interface so you have to be disciplined about making changes. Instead of marking class members private, the convention is to use a leading underscore. Users of your class can access the variable but they do so at their own risk. There's also the double underscore but that's an implementation detail of class name mangling and not a convention for private. Another great example is the use of list and dictionary comprehension, which are highly-readable syntactic sugar around lambdas. In C# you might do: List&lt;int&gt; input = List&lt;int&gt;() { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }; List&lt;int&gt; output = List&lt;int&gt;(); for (int i = 0; i &lt; input.Count; i++) { if (i &lt; 3) { output.Add(i); } } In C-like languages, that's how you filter a list. You're probably thinking you could use LINQ to clean that up, right? Python has something similar called list comprehension: input = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] output = [x for x in input if x &lt; 3] You could write an iterator just like in the C# example but that wouldn't be very Pythonic. Two things are generally true about Python: 1. there's usually an obvious way to do something so if something seems hard then there's probably a batter way, and 2. Pythonic code is usually highly readable code. Not being allowed to have comments is a big red flag. I generally agree that code should be self-documenting but docstings are a must. Thinking back, all of my C# projects were documented more or less the same way as how I document Python code.
I know what you're saying about not knowing what stuff returns but that's one of the tradeoffs that come with the power of the language. I think it's too easy to throw `**kwargs` around everywhere because its nearly impossible to refactor when everything just sorta throws that on there. I don't know your codebase, but I can say that once you're familiar with the codebase this sort of thing becomes a non-issue and you'll be able to refactor parts of it to be easier. I know that doesn't help, and I feel bad that you're stuck with that situation.
Stoooopppp
He wants to be pandentic? What's that like?

How do I input the drunkenness variable?
Because python is one on the largest and fastest growing languages, especially in data processing. Lua would be shooting themselves in the knee. It takes like 100 lines to give python an table class suitable for excel.
Useragent is as easy to spoof as rewriting the header. Selenium no doubt supports this.
&gt;He wants to be pandentic? What's that like? LOL! It's like being pedantic while stoned. 
It's super trivial to spoof user agents to get around blocks that filter based on them. Literally a 10s google search.
By making pythonxl, a python derivative that only works in excel. It's incompatible with pandas but more performant and embedable in excel so users have to commit to their api. The ecosystem fractures and more new python devs are MS only. Or something like that.
Looks like it could be used as a Selenium replacement. Be still my heart...
Python meets all those but the first. What's your beef with meaningful indentation? Any language without it has tools that apply it for readability.
At least he's not also shallow.
Integration into existing build infrastructure, multi-language and multi project setups, deployment for multiple python versions, code generation (eg. Via swagger)... In thought it's a good idea and want to give it a try
You can always press ctrl alt del in windows to terminate pyautogui lib
&gt; if it can be run with an application running over top of it. It hijacks your mouse pointer to do the things that you would normally do with a mouse, so no you can't really multitask all that well. Just run it in a VM and let it do its thing there and it won't interfere with whatever else you want to do.
For real tho.
Nah, just a little indecisive... maybe.
Brilliant
It’s easier and less complicated to do with JS and can be done entirely within the browser.
I use Gitlab instead, I know quite a lot of other people do as well. It's structured moreso towards private repositories and groups. It's also relatively straightforward to migrate from Gitlab's Amazon AWS service to a self-maintained Git server running Gitlab. Github is more a social networking site, IMO. 
Amateur, I reached the end of Tinder doing it manually. And I live in a major city.
 &gt;Integration into existing build infrastructure I've never heard of it with python but at least you aren't introducing a dependency. &gt;multi-language I'd use configuration. &gt;multi project setups Huh? &gt;deployment for multiple python versions Use future and write python 2/3 compatible code. &gt;code generation (eg. Via swagger)... Python is pretty great for Meta programming. Never ever thought of code generation outside of python as a solution to anything. Basically, python has idioms for doing all of this and going a different route might make your code unmaintainable by anyone but you.
Interesting test. Though it just states in the end that my data shows a slight automatic preference towards European American children. It doesn't show how it gets to that conclusion or any other kind of proof for that statement. Talking about bias by the way: https://youtu.be/3WMuzhQXJoY

Could I train a machine learning model based on my swipes as to what kind of pictures I find attractive? I wonder what kind of horrifying image would come out when ran backwards (I don't know machine learning or the term for having it synthesize based on a model)
Note: If you swipe right to all the people, the Tinder algorithm is going to deem you as 'desperate', and therefore, not very attractive. And it's going to lower your ranking so you'll get shown less and less to the most attractive people.
That word, fleshy, it gives me chills. Like, fleshy is just not the right word here. FLESHY
but then you end up swiping right on chicks who look like this https://i.imgur.com/jPO9d0N.png

You can do this very easily with [Brython](http://brython.info).
