&gt;And by that you mean a disastrous design decision No, I mean it's a nice syntactic sugar. In most contexts that I've seen this used, the comparison operator has been `!=`, which is much less prone to this kind of grief, and in this day and age, it's most responsible to use a toolchain with static analyzers or linters or compilers which will throw up alarm bells if you mistype the `==` as `=` or vice-versa.
Because print(“phrase”) would print “phrase” and print(phrase) would print the variable contents. 
I like pathlib, but had a lot of faff making it do exactly what I needed (using paths as paths, but also being able to write them out to a file as strings)
That is helpful, especially for someone who has intuition for roughly what their regex should look like. I imagine this series is more targeted at folks who never learned regex in any capacity.
There's also PyAutoGUI: [https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui](https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui)

Are they different physical machines? What linear algebra package are you using? Can you write a simple example and profile the differences?

Lol thanks for the reply. I did try restarting the computer. The solution was apparently to re-update anaconda after reinstalling. First crisis of the day successfully averted ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
You are awesome. Saving this post to come back to later. 
Haha nice. Package version issues are such a pain, especially updating conda and anaconda themselves. I tend to do my work in various isolated conda environments, which helps a lot. Cheers
This week learning more about file handling and data parsing.

Yes. So the player will not knowing which turtle will be the winner 
Pfft. Just copy paste from SO like the rest of us.

Your operating system (Windows, MacOS, Linux, etc) manages the resources of your computer and provides the interactive environment your probably used to using when interacting with computers. In OP's program, he uses the os module to clear the console, and also to check what the operating system is so the correct string is used to clear the console. os.name == 'nt' will return True if the operating system is windows.
Not even. He still has the power of BDFL. He still takes actions like a BDFL. He still is under a social power structure, where he is put above the rest. He is the BDFL in all but name. Again, not that I mind this. But it's clearly a political move due to the hate that he received over assignment expressions. For anybody that doesn't look too far deep, he has resigned and given up power, so people who hate that feature think they've won. For anyone looking deep, they see that he's the same Guido he always has been.
I was looking at [this](https://docs.python.org/3.8/whatsnew/3.8.html)

That's nonsense, because an idea has an infinite amount of implementations. In older languages or Go where assignment is `:=`, nobody has to deal with a consequence.
The accountability is fake and a faux pas at best. Guido still has the social structure, power, and action, of a BDFL and continues to act in this manner. His "resignment" means nothing and was just a move to appease 372 haters.
I think it's useful to build up an idea of when to use, or not use regex. That typically comes from experience and takes time to learn. This can be short-cut by a good article.
*Python 101, 102.* \- great information all around. Great std lib coverage I've not seen before. *Hitchhiker's Guide* \- has tons of other resources listed on the website in addition to the book. The book will teach you how to make packages for example. &amp;#x200B;
Oh wow, stupid beginner mistake I guess. Thanks for the help!
I need web full stack framework... with Frontedn built-in and Backend... so I can create a CRUD more easy.. create a model with fields.. and get Form on Frontend, with all fields set (date, time, number etc..). I can use Django, but on Django I need to develop all html, css and javascript code... 
And why doesn't Frappe or Django-Admin not work for you? 
Like what? I'd love to learn something like Django, but am open to suggestions. Do you have any books you'd recommend to learn one? Or even an Ebook/online resources?
Thanks for this. Definitely one I'm gonna check out!
Is the full Hitchhikers guide available online? Or is there stuff in the book exclusive from whats available online?
If you’re looking to just display some data I’d recommend Dash. It’s built on Flask but codes the JS for you (using D3.js) It’s a bit more high level, so a bit easier to use for a first project, and rendered graphs and tables easily. Best of luck!!
I'd love to hear more about this as well!
Why do you need to use the existing hosting? A church should be able to host a site on a $5/month VPS (eg Linode, Digital Ocean). Shared hosting has not been a good deal for a while now. It makes sense for WP because you need someone else to do managed updates for all the security issues, but for everything else, you can just DIY. 
I love you
&gt;I am also not able to access the server by using the machine’s ipv4 address which my implementation is contingent on I would look into that, if you can't access an IP address, odds are it will affect other frameworks/libraries as well.
Are you passing lifestyle judgement on a programming subreddit?
I can access it with django or cherrypy, but yes i am going to look into it. For now though I think I will switch gears and instead have my users run a batch script to post the needed data, and then try and figure out from there if I can get that batch script to run from a signal sent from the server.
The GIL being a problem is a symptom of Python’s data model being entirely mutable, with no way to define data structures as immutable or functions/methods as pure/nonmutating. Were this possible, the GIL could be reduced to code which mutates nonlocal state, allowing multiple threads to run concurrently most of the time. 
I see your point. It's possible (but definitely not idiomatic) to do e.g. ```python from cytoolz import pipe pipe( s, # thru x, y, z, ) ``` The reason to prefer `pipe` (and I'm accepting that this is probably not what most people want) is that it does not require instantiating a wrapper type. Its invocation just involves generic data and functions.
Docs is not enough now?
C'mon man. Are we really gonna discuss the **importance of** / **difference between** docs and tutorials here now? 
I am also learning Django. I started with Django for beginners by William Vincent. There is also a blog about Django - www.simpleisbetterthancomplex.com
Yeah, i actually found that the same thing(even with smaller scripts; all things i write in python) happened to me. I still haven't found a fix, but since i don't use any windows only tools(if i have to, i'll use a virtual machine), i have fully switched to ubuntu. *I know this might not a be valid fix for you*, but it might be something to think about(dual booting with ubuntu/other distros and using python in linux and the other stuff in windows)
Read some books on the psychology of sleep and release this as a commercial better sleep solution, also add support for various devices.

thank you. this just made my day. love regex
&gt; Why do you need to use the existing hosting? Because this shared hosting is $11/mo and includes email hosting, DNS etc. Yes, I could probably run a mail server on a VPS but I really don't want to run an email server, it's a pain in the ass. Plus, I don't know if you're a member of a church, but the internal politics of a church can be a complex thing. Changing all this round might be seen as trying to push out the person who currently is in charge of the DNS and email stuff. Additionally, I expect that dumping WP isn't going to be popular in the first place - so I'm trying to minimize the amount of upheaval at any given time and kind of change things slowly... &gt;It makes sense for WP because you need someone else to do managed updates for all the security issues Except this shared hosting company didn't even do that afaik. We have to apply WP updates ourselves.
The new test explorer is really great!
You need to clarify if this is on the same machine. Try some simple but large numpy multiplication and time it. Share that code here, and we can see if we can replicate. 
You can check out some of the more popular libraries for model building and then from there, once you've developed a sense of how the process works it becomes much easier to conceptualize what pieces go into the network.
For anyone trying to learn interactively with guided examples I recommend this website: [https://regexone.com/](https://regexone.com/) &amp;#x200B; The best I've come across so far.
I have two questions/ 1)How do you write code on a mobile device. 2)Could you send me a video of the whole code so I could copy it and use it as an example since it has loads of useful code and right now I am trying to get the hang of the random and turtle module so this could help me massively! \-Thanks,[Mr.Red](https://Mr.Red) &amp;#x200B;

It looks the default behavior is to poll once-per-second? Is that so, or am I misunderstanding? [https://github.com/polyaxon/ocular/blob/master/ocular/\_\_init\_\_.py#L61](https://github.com/polyaxon/ocular/blob/master/ocular/__init__.py#L61)
Your pairs can be construct using `zip`, one with original list, one with offset by 1. In [127]: a = [chr(i) for i in range(65, 91)] # Construct a list of A-Z In [128]: assert list(zip(a,a[1:])) == [(a[i], a[i+1]) for i in range(len(a) - 1)] # Test result In [129]: %timeit list(zip(a,a[1:])) 1.12 µs ± 23.6 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each) In [130]: %timeit [(a[i], a[i+1]) for i in range(len(a) - 1)] 3.13 µs ± 19 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each) It looks like `zip` method is almost 3 times faster. In real life, unless you are running soft real time system, I don't see a huge improvement between 1µs and 3µs. Your algorithm is performing O(N log N) operation (just the sorting part), so any improvement will mostly in using Python tricks.
Pathlib can break things where another class, method or function expects a path as a string and not a Path object, or vice versa. So, I only use it when I know it's not going to break things.
Lots of extra ad impressions...

I think you mean a text editor? “As black” is called the theme. When you use a different text editor, you should search for how to change the theme, if you don’t like the default on that editor. “Numbers on the side” are line numbers. They’re a feature of certain text editors. Some editors do not have this feature by default, but it can be added. Be sure to search how to add this capability to the text editor you choose. There are many text editors available for almost all major OS. Here are a few that I’ve used in the past, that have theme customizability and line numbering Atom(text editor) TextWrangler Sublime Text I suggest searching for these (and others), choosing one you enjoy, then learning how to customize them. Lastly, if you would like to use an interactive development environment (IDE) I suggest Spyder or PyCharm. In my experience, IDEs tend to have more of these features as default settings. However, an IDE is not required to run python code. Hope this helps, sorry it’s long. 
Don't have a repo for obvious reasons. But I do...have...one sec.
Options ==&gt; Configure IDLE I don't use IDLE so I don't know any details, but you can make your own theme, and probably import a ready made theme. Quick look around there is an IDLE Dark default theme, but it is Blue.
How do you get the text editors.
updated
Usually through the website of the text editor in question. For example, let’s say you want to start using Atom. Hop on over to google and just search: Atom text editor for windows Then, navigate the webpage to download the application. Once you’ve done so, you should be able to open up the folders system of your computer, navigate to where you downloaded the file, and open the application. Alternatively, there could be options for creating a desktop icon for the text editor. In which case, be mindful of the options on the installation windows.
Thanks
Happy to help
You might be referring to ipython, a very nice python REPL. 
What is the difference?
FWIW, Plumbum offers great path objects that subclass str. 
Another bit of advice is to break it down into bits. I can see 3 main things you're going to need to learn (in addition to general programming stuff). 1. Downloading something from the web. Use the Python library 'requests' for this 2. Extract bits of data from a web page. Use 'BeautifulSoup' for this. 3. Creating an Excel file from data. There are a few options for this, openpyxl looks good. Thankfully https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ has got you covered for all 3. But you can tackle each bit in any order, you don't have to put it all together. For example, you could just do number 3 to start, and break that down: 1) create a file that is an empty spreadsheet. 2) create an almost empty spreadsheet with a a single row of text cells at the top etc. 
Try it out, and [read some docs](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Among other things, great tab completion and colors, and convenience shortcuts (like `coolmethod?` to see that method's docstring). 
??? That makes zero sense to me. Is sharing projects and reading articles *not* how to learn a language?

Another problem with that approach is that it doesn't easily support any additional args or kwargs to each stage in the pipe. I've tried to come up with something as flexibly useful in python as these kinds of things are in clojure but I've honestly failed to get anything that's actually worth using in practice. Python, or at least idiomatic python, is intentionally much less flexible about this kind of stuff.
Hey, I have downloaded atom but I dont know how to use it. Could you please help me. &amp;#x200B;
That's true, I did not give him credit for that lol
Not really, 3.6 and 2.7 are comparable in speed. The new dictionary implementation is wonderful, and the order-follows-insertion became standard (guaranteed) behavior from 3.7 on. As for performance, 3.7 shipped (and 3.8 will ship) a lot of "minor" improvements, which in the end add up. I haven't been able to move to 3.7 yet (tensorflow wasn't compatible until 1.12, and now we're just waiting for py38 and tf 2 at work), but I'd expect it (or 3.8) to be faster than 2.7 (finally!). However, if you're using async or some form concurrency/multiprocessing, you'll probably be able to extract some more performance from your code than on 2.7. Also, lazy iterators everywhere help.
The description on the sub is literally this: &gt;Subreddit for posting questions and asking for general advice about your python code. &amp;#x200B;
Definitely, but were those actually standard practice or even in use at all in 2003?
It's not a general education sub. It's a place where people who are learning python can ask questions.
This site is my go-to as well.
Yeah, politics can be tough, but remember that it’s easier to ask forgiveness than permission. Get something working (Wagtail, Squarespace, whatever) and present it as fait acompli to the church board. Worst case, you’re out your time plus ten bucks for the initial month of hosting. 
A valuable skill to practice when using code to solve problems is navigating the wealth of knowledge already available to you through the internet. Many programmers will joke about the outrageous frequency they use resources like stack overflow, library documentation, and video tutorials to solve just one part of their problem. To get you started, here is a link to an atom tutorial series I found: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EyG20hhON6E All I did to find this was type “Atom text editor tutorial” into google. You should learn that simply searching a specific question through google can be a fast way to connect with resources. Hopefully, that’s enough to kickstart your learning experience. 
Maybe try posting this to r/learnpython for further help? This may not be the best sub. 
That’s odd. I have the opposite problem — many more ideas than I have time to implement.
I think recently someone had a post about how they used a python script to improve their own QOL for sleeping. To me, this is exemplifies a better sequence for finishing projects than a deadline. In other words, the code was one of the last things in place when solving the problem. My advice boils down to, don’t confine yourself to “I want to write code that does xyz” because I feel at that point only the deadline (if there is one) will motivate you to finish; and if they’re just side projects not even the deadline can do it. Instead, try finding problems that interest you first, then visualize your process for solving it, then see what tools/skills you have that might make your thought process reality. Code might be one of them. If you want to help people, maybe the first step would be talking to people and seeing what their stories are. From there, I think you could build something great. 
I prefer https://pythex.org/ nice and simple.

I've turned down php and java positions with higher pay because I'd rather work using mostly python. YMMV but the management I've dealt with cares about how much it costs to on-board new programmers and I think they choose php and java tech stacks because they think that's where the talent pools are the largest. The thing about python is that it has fewer quirks and is less verbose (and number of bugs correlates with number of lines of code regardless of language) and is just much more of a joy to work with. New programming hires, even if they're not primarily python developers, will get up to speed quicker and be more productive in the long run. Some argue that python is not suitable for large code bases, but esp. with tooling like mypy and good test coverage, I think this is much less of an issue than it may have been in the past. I hope for you that some of your audience has a technical background, otherwise it's really a shame how these kinds of decisions are made in your organization.

I'm sorry, but "it's 2019" is a ridiculous argument for getting rid of the GIL, regardless of the proliferation of multi-core CPUs. - If you want CPU-bound parallelism, there's `multiprocessing`, which covers 99% of cases by sheer volume. It's even better with the shared memory addition in 3.8.0a2. - If you want I/O bound parallelism, there's always `threading`, which isn't as tricky to use as some people think -- it's just a bit counterintuitive. - If you want _really_ large scale parallelism, you may want to look at the big GPGPU computation libraries. The GIL is absolutely a feature, which enables the user from having to manage many tiny locks unless they're willing to write a C module for that. Python's done pretty well in recent years following this model.
`Path("/"). resolve()` to turn whatever Path object into a string path. 
Python Flask. 
Jython and Iron Python have the same data model and no GIL.
`str(Path("/"))` works fine also. 
Yep. Thats the point of the article
where do you put your searchable content
Yeah, maybe. I might look and see if I can get it to the point of being a drop in replacement so they can't say "Oh but it doesn't do &lt;thing&gt;". At the very worst I'll have learned something. Anyway, can I run that under mod_python? Because I think that will be a big influential factor.

It's a crying shame that this is being downvoted in a Python group. Regex = Perl = Larry Wall = OUR ENEMY. Regex is the exact opposite of the Zen Of Python. 
Computer science has nothing to do with Regex. Maybe you should read the Zen Of Python though and learn why Regex is the bane of everything Python stands for.
web2py and reahl are worth looking at.
There are several libraries existing that abolish the Larry Wall mindset and replace regex with a Guido Van Rossum mindset, such as Verbal Expressions. http://changelog.com/posts/stop-writing-regular-expressions-express-them-with-verbal-expressions http://changelog.com/posts/meet-regexpbuilder-verbal-expressions-rich-older-cousin 
Regex is evil. It's the anti-Python. If you were a "pythonista" you would be loyal to the Zen of Python and despise Regex in all of its incarnations.

WE ARE PYTHON USERS. Python and Regex are philosophically incompatible. 
I actually think people are sometimes underconfident when it comes to regexes nowadays, due to this advice being repeated so many times (because of legitimate chronic regex abuse). I think it's pretty a simple formula: * If your language has native capabilities for something, use those (like `.split` and `.startswith` in Python) * If a parser exists for it, use that * If it's a non-regular language (e.g. uses nested parentheses), write a parser for it * Otherwise, just use regex
For better or worse, you will need to know HTML, CSS and JS to do any WebDev pretty much. &amp;#x200B; I'm not expert, but when I hear someone say I'm a webdev who uses Python (or Ruby, PHP, etc.) there's an underlying assumption that they use said language *in addition* to the necessary web technologies.
Yes, this is called NLP - Natural Language Processing. Look into [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) and [spaCy](https://spacy.io/).
Cool, what’s the reason you went with Sanic instead of Django, Flask etc?
Since the project required a certain level of concurrency I thought it would be easier to pick a solution that was developed with that in mind. Looking back I would have done fine if not better with Flask because of the better documentation and easier testing/debugging. But it was a really nice learning experience, since I've never really done async programming before.
I'm personally very fond of any() all() and next() which can make a lot of business logic very simple.
I see. Good documentation and maturity can go a long way
You must be joking! Python supports regex by default through re module. It's in the standard library. So I don't think Python is somehow against regular expressions.
I think it's cementing my opinion that larger programming subreddits are not worth commenting in,people have such awkward non industry standard opinions, yeah regex probably works fine for your cute codegolf answer on stack overflow- real production codebases with actual complex regex in them are hell

Marconi Union weightless, the 10hr version
ubuntus python interpreter is optimised for their system. its possible anaconda is using a generic build? the psf executables are provably slower than the one ubuntu ships because they have yo run on multiple systems.
Getting myself ready for some simple automation of files that need to be transferred via FTP to a remote site, processed by that organization, and responses FTP'd back to us. I need to clean the files before they go out, move them into the right folders, then schedule a task to check the folders daily for response files. I want to then parse those files for error messages and have them reported so I know when I need to check in. All in all, it should save me a couple hours a week.
I feel like the site won't do much good unless you have a ready regex sentence, as the site doesn't provide cheat sheet.
You could use crossbar.io to write a client app that always runs on users machine (invoking it with windows scheduler with every reboot for example). It connects to a central WAMP router that you can set up on the same machine where you run the django app, but on different port. You could then invoke RPC functions on client app with another app or directly from WAMP router HTTP call. Needs some studying, but it is pretty cool tech to learn.
Your second `list` is lowercase but your first is uppercase. Also `List` is a bad variable name because it is a class also. 
I know sorry for the syntax and my list won’t be named list. 
no framework has better documentation or testing/debugging than django. the fact you would choose flask over django makes me seriously question if you know what you are doing. flask is a url router for people who desperately want friends and are willing to rewrite a worse version of django and dealing with dependency hell in order to be liked by flask cultists
Just went through a couple in the middle and was impressed with your presentation! You are **concise and thorough in your explanations**. Usually I have to speed up playback because many people on yt "um, ah" and don't generally know what they are going to say next. **Kudos!**
Well considering I wrote that this is my first big project I don't that much experience. But on the other hand according to the [jetbrains python developer survey](https://www.jetbrains.com/research/python-developers-survey-2018/) almost 50% use Flask. It has been steadily growing. So they must be doing something right.
17 parts! 
50% of developers have less than 5 years experience estimates to Dr. Robert C. Martin. Flask has an internet cult around that hypes it up way beyond any merit it ever had, and so it became "cool" to people susceptible to hype. 
This belongs in /r/learnpython
Im wondering what you actually consider "interesting parts". How do you make this judgement?
I just took a look at [Frappe](https://frappe.io/frappe) and from my perspective having MySQL has a required dependency is not too appealing.
It's mix of chat engagement and video summarization. There's still a lot of ways to improve it. For example cut out short pauses. Also a lot of domain knowledge i.e. twitch culture is necessary to make those judgments. It's a first working prototype. I hope it is good enough
/r/learnpython Format your code properly (triple backticks before and after, or 4 spaces in front of each line). Nothing is in your list, so it'll never print anything. `input` always returns a string (in modern python), so there's no need to wrap it in the `str()` call. If your list has numbers in it (i.e. integers or floats), and you're checking whether the base-10 string representation of that number is in the list, it obviously won't be.
10 minutes read 8 years ago was enough for me to use regex till this day. 17 part video... hmmm, nope.
Jython and IronPython solve this by having thousands of tiny locks instead of a god lock.
[removed]
Your code never adds any numbers to the list. You probably want something like: if num in the_list: print("number is already in the list") else: print("adding the number to the list") the_list.append(num) 
This is insane :0
Same thing happened to me. What I did was, sit back and think. I figured that by side projects, people are doing stuff that are making their life easier. So I went and made a list of stuff I keep doing manually and repetitively. &amp;#x200B; As a obsessive guy who keeps checking status pages of anything and everything, finding bunch of things I keep doing again and again was not so hard. I found them, and automated them using python. &amp;#x200B; For example, I was checking status page of a manuscript that I submitted to a journal at least 5-10 times each hour I was on internet. Even when I was shopping, I was going to that status page from my mobile. So, I wrote a python script that checks the status page every 20 min and send an email to me if there is an update. Put the script as a cron job in my Raspberry Pi. Now that thing alone saved a lot of time for me. Later one I converted the same script for any kind of thing I had to check status of repetitively. &amp;#x200B; That's what a programming language is for. Making life easier. Find out what is going to make your life easier.
Be more specific as to what your ACTUAL code is. The code you listed I’m assuming does not represent your question. For example : list = [] This list is empty, there are no string elements or integers, etc. Nothing for python to look at and make a comparison to your input variable num. Thus your print statement will never print anything. Also, already stated but “list” is not a good variable name as it already has a duty in python - don’t double duty it haha. A word of advice. If you are not worried about the input being a string or integer (if it’s irrelevant) you don’t need to cast num as a string python will see num as a string unless you tell it otherwise. But, in the case you want to do an action with num later on or with elements from your list like mathematical equations (adding to elements, comparison or lesser/higher/equal to etc.) you’ll need to cast num as an integer or float. I.e: num = int(input(“Enter a number: “)) This tells python to accept input (assuming its an number capable of being casted as an integer) and recognize it’s an integer and treat it as such. Otherwise, num could be “4” for example but python won’t know see integer “4” it will see string “4” Lastly, if you are making comparisons regarding input and list elements, be specific. For example: list_var = [1,2,3] num = input(“Enter number “) When you write: if num in list_var: print(“Yes it is.”) When the user enters 876,140 “Yes it is” will be printed because “1” is found inside the num, even though it’s just a part of 876,140 and not specially equal to “1”. If you want a direct comparison you’d need to write: if num == “1”: print(“yes it is”) In the case of a string. Or depending on how specific you are with your comparison your could write: if num &lt;= 1: print(“yes it is”) In the case that num is casted as an integer. But coding is about purpose = 100%. In other words, when you sit down to wrote a code you need your distinct purpose for python or any language. For example your question could be more like: I want to have a list with 20 various numbers inside it that I will pre-fill. The numbers will be string elements. I want to ask the user to input a number and I want to tell the user if that exact number is inside the list. If the exact number is in the list I want to print a statement to the user and tell the user “Yes, it is.”

For large tasks I agree that they will be distribured across multiple machines and multi-processing is appropriate. For most desktop tasks, you're probably IO bound and the GIL isn't an issue. However there is a subset of problems that require fast local computation: for example a complex game, a chess engine, or a spreadsheet application. For these tasks, the GIL is an issue. We probably wouldn't normally use Python for those types of program anyway, but it would be nice to make inroads into this space.

I came looking for this quote, and I wasn't disappointed. I've solved some big practical problems with it, but the quote isn't wrong.

Seems like it would be fun to bet with friends on or settle disagreements. Being able to set the amount of turtles being raced would be great. Possible set best out of 3/5 modes as well.
I think /r/pythonnews already has pretty much every news-worthy article that has been posted here in the last six months. The problem is that there is just not that much real "News" about Python, so there is not much traffic in that sub. I found /r/pythontips seems to have a better signal-to-noise ratio if you're looking for Python discussion that is a little bit higher-level than /r/learnpython.
Thank you the format I didn’t know !

I recommend web scrapping...there are a lot of things you can automate there like getting news about things you like, downloading things from a specific website, and so on. Check requests, beautifulsoup, and selenium modules, they are pretty cool. The first thing that got me into python was web scrapping when i read about it in the 'Automate the boring stuff with python' book. Check that book too if you want, it has a lot of examples you can do and some ideas for mini projects. Hope it helps :)
If could incorporate tools such as (flake8)[http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/] and (black)[https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/] into this, I think you might really like the result. As it stands, I have a few issues with the coding style/conventions used throughout. Such as, using `b""` for most if not all string literals in the codebase. As well as probably some weird usages of collections.

would you mind sharing with us?
I made an app that does the same thing as those photo sticks (removed dupes, handles naming conflicts, etc) Wrote my uncle an app that webscrapes, fills out rebates, and consolidates them into a single pdf to print for a hardware store he frequents for his apartment complex.
At work all night. Will update tomorrow.
Im a student, would it be possible to for example write code to gather lecture notes from online and group them together in files or whatever?
Can you give a little more detail about what you're trying to accomplish? I'm not sure what you mean by "subprocess". Are you talking about the [subprocess](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html?highlight=subprocess#module-subprocess) module? I'm also not sure what you mean by "multi-platform". Are the sub-processes going to be running on different CPUs, or on different machines? One very common and straight-forward way to communicate between different processes, on different machines, or even on the same machine, is to use the standard Python socket library. Would that work for you? 
Most likely. The module you want is called requests.
Jesus X that's a lot of video for freaking regex
You’re a Python legend 
amen i shudder
&gt; using `b""` for most if not all string literals in the codebase That was most likely a performance optimization. Bytes are faster than unicode.
&gt;Unfortunately many programmers, due to their lack of experience, of some knowledge of computer architecture(s), or of an in-depth understanding of the task they are given, spend countless hours by making life harder for themselves in the name of marginal performance gains, often trading many other conveniences (such as type safety, garbage collection, *etc*) too. The usage of bytes instead of strings is a micro-optimization. I would suggest OP take a look at things such as f-strings if they're looking for some more significant performance improvements.
There is a lot of handling of these variables in the critical path. If that is happening 100,000 times a second, micro-optimisations can quickly turn into real optimisations. Have you switched them for normal strings and benchmarked it yet?
I wrote a Flask web app that uses the Spotify API to figure out what song is currently playing on my account and then the Genius API and a little web scraping to pull the lyrics for that song and display it on the site. 
I used opencv for mine. It can both track movements (x,y coords in pixels) and do events. For context I wrote a script that would listen for mouse and keyboard movements and recorded a 5 second webcam video if they were touched. I now have a significantly large archive of videos of my IT security coworkers trying to prank me thinking I left my terminal unlocked by mistake. It also locks the inputs and locks the computer after the 5 sec video is taken and saved.

[I wrote a reddit bot to find duplicate photo postings.](https://www.reddit.com/user/SeentItBot)
In the process of doing so. I would still be willing to bet that using f-strings to replace usages of \`str.format()\` would \*still\* be a more significant improvement.
He only uses string.format() in one place and it's for one string at application startup, it's not even in the critical path.
My mistake, he's using \`str % var\`. Which is even worse in terms of performance.
I'm pretty much of the same type - I struggle with ideas. Since I participate on couple Stack Exchange sites, sometimes there's ideas coming from people who ask "Hey, is there any way to do XYZ?" or "Is there an app for that?" And I've implemented some of the things that people ask: gradually decreasing brightness according to battery level, changing wallpaper per workspace ( that's in Linux environment ), moving a window to another screen with a shortcut, etc. Often you don't notice useful automation ideas, so it can be worthwhile to see what others do and try to implement that yourself for the sake of learning, or source ideas from others because they notice/have ideas for automation which you usually never thought of implementing. Another thing you could do is to put a twist on an existing idea. For example, there's low battery popup notifications, but how about we put a twist on it and open a web page in browser ? And of course this doesn't have to remain within desktop environment. You can do things with sensors and motors using development boards, like Raspberry Pi or NodeMCU. 
Fair enough. The protocol is expecting bytes returned on the network connection though, so make sure you're converting the unicode strings to bytes before you return it across the network.
iirc everything is packed automatically by \`asyncio\`. Citation needed. I'll update with results of benchmarks/changes.
Cool :) Look forward to it - make sure you do a control run with his code obviously as your machine will perform differently to his
% operator has always been faster than str.format
The backend of [home assistant](https://home-assistant.io) is Python. Not sure if this qualifies or not based on the criteria. 
Also, my python knowledge is extremely basic so theres no way im near this level yet, but in the future are there any potential ways i could use python to make a bit of money on the side?
And now you just check your email constantly. But I suppose you could write a script to check every 20 minutes for your specific email and tweet about it. But then you just check twitter constantly. But I suppose you could write a script that checks for your specific tweet every 20 minutes and text you about it. Did my pocket just buzz ..?
I have been playing with poetry to see if it fits my needs, but a couple of features missing for me already have patches waiting to be merged and not even a reply from the developers.
OP said 3 minutes, not 10 seconds. Please revise. ^**/s**
Exactly. This is a common problem in lots of opensource projects. But it's really unfortunate that both leading Python package/dependency managers are in this state. Huh! I just remembered that Conda provides the same features. And it's [Doing fine](https://repocheck.com/#https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fconda%2Fconda), according to Repocheck. Ok, so there's another reason to give it a real shot.
Oh damn, that's so simple and useful. Thanks for the next side project idea!

No I don't. If there is a email from a contact I regular respond to, gmail notifies me and gmail is pretty good at that. The objective is to do it in a smarter way. Not in the stupidest way.

I wrote a script that ran kinit every 30 minutes. I'd leave my workstation on for weeks and the Kerberos tickets only last 24 hours. Since my home directory was on NFS, things would start failing when they couldn't write to it. 
Does it work on windows? 
I don't mean to be rude here, but you are going to encounter similar problems a LOT if you stay on the path of Machine Learning / Deep Learning / Tensor Flow / etc., and you simply can't helplessly post your problem on reddit when ever you get stuck. Do extensive research, for example via google/stackoverflow, and keep at your problem. Reiterate and try again and again. Asking for the solution from someone else will teach you nothing.
I'll second selenium, I've used it to send messages to state and federal representatives via their browser email tools.
No insult taken, but no shit, sherlock. Been dealing with this for several days. I apparently haven't articulated the correct google search pattern for the answer to show up. I have looked at the API, and the error message might as well be trying to match English to Hangul. 
This is a neat project but isn't really proof of anything. I understand this is not a full clone of Redis (and it is acknowledged in the readme), but the fact that it isn't a full clone makes this a near useless comparison. There's a lot of extra stuff redis does internally that is missing from this implementation. If you were to port those features over, the throughput would drop. It's not just command for command, where implementing the entirety of `set` or `get` makes it a fair comparison for redis's `set` and `get`. Here are some things that redis does by default that this project doesn't that would affect performance: - manage memory fragmentation over time, keeping alloc/dealloc performance high and consistent - [forks and writes data snapshot to disk every minute](https://redis.io/topics/persistence#snapshotting) - [randomly tests 200 expirable keys per second](https://redis.io/commands/expire#how-redis-expires-keys) - fire keyspace events if needed - notify listeners if needed (`blpop` listeners, etc) - replicate data if needed - update stats/metrics - write to `monitor` streams if needed - alter logic if in a transaction block - monitoring memory limit and executing eviction logic if hit And this is without me even knowing anything about redis internals. There are probably dozens of other things that happen behind the scenes during a simple command. This uses `hiredis` to parse redis requests and it's written in C. No one doubts that Python can be snappy when a chunk of the heavily lifting is done in C. Seeing that this achieves 70% of the speed should be a red flag that something is wrong with the benchmark instead of the consensus about Python's speed being wrong. If you doubt this, reimplement your redis-lite thing in C or Rust or even Go. You'll blow real redis away for all the reasons I listed above. I feel like a dick typing all this, but saying things like: &gt; pydis is an experiment to disprove some of the falsehoods about performance and optimisation regarding software and interpreted languages in particular. &gt; Unfortunately many programmers, due to their lack of experience, of some knowledge of computer architecture(s), or of an in-depth understanding of the task they are given, spend countless hours by making life harder for themselves in the name of marginal performance gains, often trading many other conveniences (such as type safety, garbage collection, etc) too. is just so strongly and confidently worded yet so wrong given what is shown in this repo.

If you are just learning i advice you getting PyCharm free for a year with your college mail, i love that IDE. Shame that i have a shitty laptop and need to keep it on Low Power Mode to run it decently.
Web scraping was my introduction to building a useful program. Visiting websites to gather information is something that every developer does, and is a ripe choice for automation. It's straightforward to think of the problem and solution and gently eases people into thinking about problem solving with programming. +1 would highly recommend learning web scraping

Thank you everyone
One of important features for things like Redis or Memcache is the memory overhead. What this toy project doesn’t show is the memory usage. Running a code with as tight constraints as redis where even a memory allocator matters should say a lot. Don’t get me wrong interpreted languages get you a long way, the problem starts once you start hitting heavy load and GC kicks in. 
&gt; If you doubt this, reimplement your redis-lite thing in C or Rust or even Go. You'll blow real redis away for all the reasons I listed above. Why don't you do it yourself, to prove him wrong?
It looks like your problem is datatype related and happens during mapping when fetching data from a tf record. If this is taken directly from a tutorial I would recommend you try and "clean" you setup, to make sure that dependencies and what not are tightly managed by you, as we should assume that the tutorial isn't a complete hoax. My personal way of doing this involves A: Building Tensorflow from Source with your desired setup (Cuda/ROCm/whatever).

It looks like your problem is datatype related and happens during mapping when fetching data from a tf record.

The person making the claim needs to adequately prove it and be receptive to criticism.
What is there to prove wrong? If you're doubting Python is slower than some other languages, there are numerous benchmarks out there showing this to be the case. If you're doubting a partial redis clone wouldn't be faster than actual redis, look at the list above (also..generally, of course less features==better performance). Is there something specific I said that you disagree with?
I wrote a script that checked my ISP up/down speed and latency and then saved this to a csv file. I scheduled the script to run every 15 minutes.
If you have an iPhone too, you can use Pythonista and for the music maybe the shortcuts app with base64 text encoded, so if its long you can reduce space and just decode the file when running this script :)

As much as person giving criticism needs to prove it.
It's also using uvloop which is a heavily Cythonized project.
But you can "prove it" by using a combination of language benchmarks and common sense. Is it really up for debate that a small slice of a project can be optimized to perform better than the entire thing?
If you have a big project/module that uses database connections, write a decorator that passes a connection into the wrapped function. It's a nice, clean solution that eliminates lots of duplicated code. &amp;#x200B; [This link](http://initd.org/psycopg/articles/2010/10/22/passing-connections-functions-using-decorator/) gives an ok example of this. I tweak it to allow the decorator to take in arguments like connection strings and passwords, etc. 
`poetry` is nice but new versions break compatibility too much. I launched it on ~5 projects and I don't think it works anymore on any of them.
According to this Health Check, pallets/flask is "in the weeds"
Its totally possible, sure. But you would need to learn about interacting with the web, accessing the notes, downloading the notes- and then the real fun is reading and sorting 30 different text files, all possibly written in a different layout or format. And if they're possibly handwritten notes, you'll get into OCR and all that fun stuff. Short answer, yes absolutely. And in many different ways, mines just an example. My advice? Start with something short and sweet. Make a chat program that you can use in lecture across LAN. Something small, but interesting and useful. And then build a bunch of those little programs. Eventually you'll have a cool little swiss-army knife of scripts and code that you've written. Probably more than you asked, but if you're interested in programming- that's a general approach that has worked for me over the years.

A few points in particular: You criticize this project for using \`hiredis\` to parse commands. The thing is, this project is trying to make a server that is API-compatible with Redis, and Redis API was built primarily to be easy to parse in language the server is written in, that is, C. So it's only natural to parse commands that are made easy to parse in C, in C. If this project didn't want to provide API-compatibility, but only feature-compatibility, it could have created it's own API that is easier to parse in Python. &amp;#x200B; &gt; Seeing that this achieves 70% of the speed should be a red flag that something is wrong with the benchmark, not an indication that Python isn't as slow as people say. You are jumping to conclusions here. Maybe the benchmark is actually right, and your assumptions is wrong? &amp;#x200B; &gt; If you doubt this, reimplement your redis-lite thing in C or Rust or even Go. You'll blow real redis away for all the reasons I listed above. I'd expect YOU to do this, as it is likely that in fact, you won't blow real Redis out of the water without serious optimization work that has gone into it. If you want to prove your point, you need to give arguments, not ask for the other side to try and find arguments for you.
I would check out Django or Flask. I personally like Flask since it’s less batteries included. 
&gt;pallets/flask &amp;#x200B; Yeah, let's see: &gt;In the past month, the repo maintainers closed **2** pull requests, while **6** new PR's remain open ... In the same time period, there were **17** issues closed vs. **9** new ones submitted. Score: **3.9/10**. My algorithm weights PR efficiency twice as important as Issue efficiency, so that's dragging the score down: There were 8 new PR's, but only 2 were resolved. I'm rethinking my math, but generally I want to answer the question: are the maintainers on top of things? Or is work piling up faster than they're clearing it?
Poetry is really promising. It solves not just the dependency problem, but the packaging problem. It still has its flaws, but you kinda have to accept this if you’re an early adopter of a sub-1.0 library. I have a vested interest in making this work. I even have an open PR against the repo for functionality I need to be able to use it to package wheels for meaningful code re-use. At this point we can wait for these PRs to merge, or if it truly falls in the weeds (I think it’a way too early to say that), another fork can take the lead. This is the beauty of open source. 
Im curious as to what the benefits are of using python over javascript for anything web related since the web its pretty much built on javascript....
It was a joke. I hope nobody would ever do that ...
In one of the most comprehensive programming language benchmarks there is this simple page [https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/dont-jump-to-conclusions.html](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/dont-jump-to-conclusions.html) Toy program performance is not an accurate indicative of real-world program performance.
 uhhhhh, k import pyautogui, time, re while True: time.sleep(r'3 minutes, not 10 seconds') pyautogui.moveTo(10,10) reddit.revise(re.snatch(r'\*\*/s\*\*')) &amp;#x200B;
Yep - Poetry appeals to me for the same reasons. That's what I'm using for a new project, where I ran into several problems. I read some issues and PR's and saw that things aren't moving.
This is beautiful
Yes! 
&gt; You criticize this project for using `hiredis` to parse commands. The thing is, this project is trying to make a server that is API-compatible with Redis, and Redis API was built primarily to be easy to parse in language the server is written in, that is, C. So it's only natural to parse commands that are made easy to parse in C, in C. If this project didn't want to provide API-compatibility, but only feature-compatibility, it could have created it's own API that is easier to parse in Python. You're missing my point here. Using the C library is a smart and pragmatic choice. If this were a real project, I would do the same. But if you're lifting a major chunk of the code into C while trying to claim Python is faster than people say it is, don't you think that kind of takes the oomph out of the point being made? &gt; You are jumping to conclusions here. Maybe the benchmark is actually right, and your assumptions is wrong? Again, missing the point. The benchmark can't be right if it isn't an exact comparison. You can't skip implementing CPU-consuming features and then compare speed to something that does implement those features. Also, look at [how Py3 compares to C typically](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/faster/python3-gcc.html). That's like a 50x slow down typically. It wouldn't give you pause if you saw something way off from that across several benchmarks? I would look at that and think "what am I missing?". &gt; I'd expect YOU to do this, as it is likely that in fact, you won't blow real Redis out of the water without serious optimization work that has gone into it. If you want to prove your point, you need to give arguments, not ask for the other side to try and find arguments for you. Why do I need to justify the obvious point I'm making that is _skipping implementing dozens of features improves performance_? Why do I need to justify the already proven point (by benchmarks linked above and tons of others) that Python is for the majority of the time never going to beat C in a benchmark? If you combine both of these ideas, is it really controversial for me to say "using a language faster than Python and implementing less features than Redis does would lead to a faster implementation than the OP's attempt"?
Absolutely. You'll need Selenium and requests along with a module to make whatever kind of file you're outputting them as (pdf, zip, docs, excel, etc). Automate the Boring Stuff would be a useful book for its chapter on web-scraping.
I just came up with one yesterday that I haven't started yet, but here it is: Going to make a script that changes the SSID on my router at the kids bedtime.
What tool were you using? Selenium can detect HTML forms, so you should be able write a script to work that out. If they demand Single Sign On or OAuth, it's a bit trickier.
`&gt; "10"` probably isn't doing what you want.
The subprocess module is pretty powerful for automating operating system tasks. I use it often to automate things rather than using bash. This lets me port my code to other operating systems a bit easier. https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html
Qutebrowser and Spyder would be the two largest projects I can think of
You're both missing the point. 'Python' encompasses *all* the things python can take advantage of, including C libraries.
so how should i fix it? take out the " ?

I built a Twitch chat integrated caring system for my bonsai tree. It's not done yet, but it hooks up to an array of sensors and aggregates this data to a Django API I built &amp; integrate an on screen animation of Steve The Bonsai who will let viewers know when he's ready to be watered, fed, or trimmed. I used a Particle Photon for handling the physical tasks and I very much recommend it for people learning, cause it's much better than most Pi's I've used for constant project reuse.
You probably want to fix it. 
I did something very similar, but it's meant for streamers to hook up to so chat can request the song or add to their playlist. Made it a service as well, cause I'm trying to get better at handling user bases. :)
You have my sympathies - we have some customers with mission-critical systems where getting changes in isn't straightforward. If you get to touch the system at all though, charting out the upgrade path is pretty straightforward and there is definitely a path that retains all python2.7 functionality into Python3 to where it's just changing the executable and you're still running. The non-functional stuff obviously takes more effort to verify in a proper engineering environment, but, in my experience, Python 3 is faster, besides what you'll have more options going forward.
/r/learnpython read the sidebar format your code for reddit (see "formatting help" below the text input box) tell us what your code is doing vs what you expect it to do
Have you tried your repo check app on historical or similar projects in past? I would assume the metrics for scoring are a lot different than normal projects. A fairer comparison would be to historical data for other similar environment/build tools. Would need to be familiar with tools that fell out of flavor to get a balanced look. Working on these projects likely requires creating a roadmap or plan of action first and foremost, before tackling issues.
ok tysm
&gt; But if you're lifting a major chunk of the code into C while trying to claim Python is faster than people say it is, don't you think that kind of takes the oomph out of the point being made? The primary point that I see this project making isn't to show that Python is fast, but to show that many people jump to premature optimization by choosing a different language. This example shows that such assumptions are not necessarily true. &gt; Also, look at [how Py3 compares to C typically](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/faster/python3-gcc.html). That's like a 50x slow down typically. Is any of those benchmarks a Redis clone? No? Then these benchmarks have no effect in this **exact** case. Look at other languages there, for example Rust vs. C. It's trading blows. The problem is, that with such toy benchmarks the performance usually depends on [Sufficiently Smart Compiler](http://wiki.c2.com/?SufficientlySmartCompiler). And what is stopping CPython runtime to perform better in this specific case than in those toy benchmarks. And what is stopping you from running your server in PyPy, JPython, IronPython rather than CPython? Every implementation performs differently on different workloads, and Redis workload is very specific. &gt;If you combine both of these ideas, is it really controversial for me to say "using a language faster than Python and implementing less features than Redis does would lead to a faster implementation than the OP's attempt"? It might not be controversial, but it is not a a fact until you try to do so.
As they say in Germany: "Danks your chan!"
Three things actually. Remove the quotes ("") and add parantheses after the if but before the colon. Also you have the equality backwards- you're saying if the size is bigger than 10 then you tell them to grow which you don't want! So flip it! It Should look like this: if(size &lt; 10): Also formatting on reddit is weird but remember to indent stuff you want to be run if the if returns true. So the print("Grow up a bit, buddy!") ​ should be indented by an extra 4 spaces (Which I think you can do quickly with tab) You aren't checking the "shoes" variable correctly. Get rid of the "shoes = yes" "yes = shoes" All it does is bypass the user input. Also, remember to put quotes around the "yes" in that if statement. I don't have experience with writing files in python so I can't help you there. How is it now?
Surely ***THIS*** will be the end for python!
Please note the difference between what you've typed and what I have typed. You used single-quotes, I have used the grave symbol. Ex: Right: `\`\`\`` Wrong:`'''`
Refererer link spam.
&gt; It might not be controversial, but it is not a a fact until you try to do so. It doesn't have to be a fact for me to claim it. I don't get what the debate is here. I gave you the reasoning and some data for why I think what I think. I'm writing a comment on reddit, not publishing a paper. I'm done talking about this, it's not even the central point of my comment. My central point is that the benchmark is not fair because it doesn't implement cpu time-consuming redis internals. &gt; This example shows that such assumptions are not necessarily true. So no, it does not show this, because it is not a fair comparison. 
Meanwhile, we all live in fear of one another. I think because we know once the first bomb is dropped, it will go nuclear immediately. No one dares take the first shot.
Hmm. I upgraded my project to use poetry for setup and publication in one afternoon and it worked great. It's really fast, and makes library/application packaging seamless. Projects are bound to lose momentum as they become more stable because the cost of maintenence climbs steadily. You know what helps projects? Adoption. You know what hurts adoption? Posting analysis based on custom heuristics to underline a supposed lack of momentum in open source projects. Both projects are very healthy. I've used both. Pipenv in a production system and poetry in personal projects. These are both good projects with good velocity and support.
I've made a reddit bot that publishes Nintendo switch and 3ds deals on specific subreddits. 
I've been thinking of trying to make something that when executed, it looks for music files on my phone (connected to PC) then copies the music files to a specific filepath, unless the file already exists there. Never done anything with Python but I want to learn and think its be a good, fun project that resulted in something I actually use. Kinda like a phone/PC music sync.
In the general sense, sure. But in this case it seems kind of weird to do a performance comparison by cloning redis in py and then using a redis C library as part of the performance comparison. It's kinda hard to express what I'm getting at here. I get your viewpoint though.
As a streamer and programmer , this interests me. Any links? 
You must be having a great Friday man. Apparently I had a crap one.
Nothing yet, haven't finished it cause I haven't found the demand enough to justify putting all the hours into that (until other projects are done), but if you want I can give you the concept I've got thus far &amp; you could take over with me consulting if you'd like. :) Don't want to see it not get finished, but afraid I may not have the time for quite a while.
GitHub's API for Issues and PRs only goes back three months. So the app creates a 3-month graph, plotting the rolling weekly score, and gives its evaluation "Super-effective" / "In the weeds" based on the last 30 days.

Are you open to changing your mind? I see a lot of evidence that directly contradicts this.
fucking python. i love it.
Performing an experiment regarding permittivity change in cryo temperatures. I made a labview script to handle control of an impedance analyzer and temperature controller. Takes a couple days to get data and I end up with 1000+ files. I made a python parser and analysis script so I can just pick different temperatures to look at. The python script creates integer value directories based on the files available... ie 80.21 K would go into a folder named 80 K. Once the files have been sorted the next part of the script performs necessary calculations and thanks to \[this amazing library\]([https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/](https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/)) is able to do a lot of averaging for me and quick plotting for archival and cursory interpretations. Pretty sure python has saved me months of unnecessary copy and pasting.
My school is having a voting for a t-shirt design for a music festival their holding. I was going to vote normally but I noticed something. They said no one could got vote more than once and said they’d be looking at ip addresses to make sure no one voted more than once. They also had it so there was no captcha or email login so I got the idea to make a python script that would vote for me thousands of times. I made it so my ip address changed every 10 seconds and made a simple python script using pynput to simulate key presses and I’m about to test it out at home. So if it works I basically rigged the voting.
It's impossible to help a project without being a maintainer. I'd love to help out on poetry, but I also don't know the codebase. Even if I learn, there's more work than just wanting to become a maintainer. 
I agree, this does not seem possible.
Wouldn't it make more sense to just block their mac addresses?
Could you recommend any good links to get started?
Yeah, I think Optional chaining is amazing and would love to see if it can be done in Python.
u/asciicodecbot info
I had hundreds of Youtube music videos in my bookmarks and I wanted to get rid of it but I also wanted also to save it on my YT account so I've made a script which extracts and converts video bookmarks and uses Youtube API to export them as a playlist.
You've mentioned ASCIICodecBot! Here are your options for using my services: "u/asciicodecbot info": Display list of functions offered. "u/asciicodecbot decode": Decodes ascii characters from binary numbers in the parent comment. E.g., "01100001 01100010 011000111 01100100 01100101" would yield "abcde". "u/asciicodecbot encode": Encodes ascii characters from parent comment into binary. Like the above function, but backwards. "u/asciicodecbot decode this: [some_string]": Decodes ascii characters from binary numbers following "this:" "u/asciicodecbot encode this: [some_string]": Encodes ascii characters from parent comment into binary. "**NOTE:** So far, only the "encode" and "decode" functions are working. We're working on implementing the other features! asciicodecbot ver. 0.3
We also are armed with nerf guns at our desk. From warning shots above the head to you now get shot for dad jokes.
I have a hard time wrapping my head around this change as python doesn't even incorporate incrementing (x++) for simplicity. I don't want to imagine having to read code like this if some joker decides to go to town on this new feature.
Server side scripting. Python has many great packages. JavaScript is fine for the browser but NodeJS take much more work to do the same thing. 
My best idea: extend the app to periodically send a a summary to a GitHub organization with the scores for all its repos. E.g., to [https://github.com/pypa](https://github.com/pypa/). I think that often, people might not realize that a particular project needs more resources.
Personally I started with django and now use flask. IMHO flask's use of decorators looks better and is easier to understand. 
Use an underscore instead of space? You really don't want to make variables with spaces in the name - even if that's actually supported. "input string" is not a good variable name; yes, we now it's input from the command line, it's type is string, but this doesn't imply anything about it's usage. Is it a user name? email address? hostname? Any of those is both more descriptive &amp; again, no space.
I'll tell you honestly and from my own experience (which means this doesn't necessarily apply to everyone). In order to be hired by an actual company, you have to know the stuff that company uses, the modules that might be specific to the sphere, and that includes things beyond Python. If you're going into data science, that means relational databases like MySQL or PostGres, numpy module, pandas module. Web development ? JavaScript likely, AWS, web server stuff(like Apache). A degree is probably great to have ( as for some reason degree that teaches absolutely little practical Python knowledge or maybe none at all, and everything is done in Java anyway blinds the HR and makes potentially incompetent developer stand out). I've had very unpleasant phone interview where recruiter just wanted to end the call as soon as they found out I'm 4 classes short of graduating aka still college student, and who gives a damn that I've bunch of applications for Linux done in Python, know some sqlite and have good understanding of Linux specifics ? There's probably higher chance to get hired as free-lancer, and make money that way. I've also had paypal donation button on my projects on GitHub and had couple people donate that way. In the past if you knew how to code, you could get a job easily, or so people in their 40s-60s tell me. Now,you have to have experience before you have experience, and qualify for tons of unreasonable buzzword requirements which HR themselves probably don't even know what they mean. That said, my experience is just that - there's apparently hoards of rockstar developers running around and posting on social media that they learned language X and started immediately making six figure salaries. Or maybe it's just my location, or resume. I know I don't know everything there is to Python, but definitely can make a thing or two, and it probably isn't enough to get hired but enough to make something useful that people appreciate. If you love the language and enjoy what you're doing, stick with it and don't focus so much on money, because economics and bureaucratic ways are sure as hell methods to destroy any desire to write good code, and for some people - desire to code at all. I'm sticking with it and probably will for a long time. There's a lot of things I still want to make and see people share reviews/articles about my stuff on blogs again.
I wrote a widget that uses ffmpeg to copy my iTunes music library into an MP3 library, so I can listen to it on my Linux and BSD machines.
11 years ago, oh my. 
I believe you can get the same effect a lot less intrusively by just toggling NumLock every minute or so. I let that script run constantly for the same purpose. I imagine if you let your script run that moves the mouse, it will mess with you when you are actually using the computer.
Here's a basic intro - https://docs.python-guide.org/scenarios/scrape/ You'll need to learn the lxml package and web scraping is most effective when you select elements using "xpath" notation. Xpath isn't unique to Python, there's a lot written about it.
Thanks!
Ah, good point. Yeah in the end the while is perfectly fine either way. Sometimes even if a while loop can be a for, the while is cleaner as well.
did you use [speedtest-cli](https://pypi.org/project/speedtest-cli/)? just curious.
This router doesn't have that functionality for outbound traffic. Changing the SSID seems pretty easy, and the rest of the 'parental' devices would just have the alternative said stored and switch over automatically.
Exactly what I was going to say. tq is a very handy tool for quick scraping and I even ended up writing my own with PyQuery. A few CSS selectors and piping commands on bash and I automated retrieving listings for appliance repair near my area from a local site. 
Although not as powerful, I think CSS Selectors are much more intuitive.

Some of the comments I’m reading are incredibly depressing. You put a lot of effort into making something to help people learn regular expressions, and people can only find negative things to say. Hey, assholes: this is free material. You have no obligation to watch it in its entirety and if it’s not your style you can carry on. Some of you are entitled as hell.
 If you are looking for a career in data science or machine learning then web development is not a necessity at all. Please see Python is the future, it is such a friendly language that people use it to make websites, to make games even apps but if you are not into software engineering you don’t need it. However, you need to get familiar with Python libraries which are more incline towards data science.

As a competitive simracer, me and my crew needed new cars settings weekly as they depends of the tracks and a new one one is picked weekly in our Sim. Some websites are providing those settings ($$) but it was boring To share them with each other in time. So i wrote a webscrapper To pull those settings using a premium account on their website and coupled it with a discord bot to automagicaly upload settings To our discord with related embed and stuffs. Was a really fun project to improve my python skills.
Since I’m practically never on Twitter (I hate using twitter but am still interested in reading what a very select number of people tweet.), I wrote an app that gets a users most recent tweet and texts it to my phone. The app isn’t perfect but it works well enough.

You know that sleep timer TVs have? I built one for my girlfriend's computer because she likes watching Netflix til she falls asleep, but hates waking up to it still playing and needing to put it to sleep. It's pretty simple to run and can operate on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
I recently made a script that tracks how many emails I have in my Gmail inbox. I used schedule and imaplib. It checks every 10 minutes if the number of emails is different from the previous measured number and if so, writes it to a csv file. Not too hard but fun to do. 
At my current job work is pretty chill and simple. Often days I can get my shit done in less than one hour. So, when I’m working from home, and done with work, in order to not seem like I’m idle, i run the script and it keeps switching between the mail client and the internal chat app; scrolls a bit, clicks new mails to mark them read etc every 10 seconds. So far it’s going great.
Could you please pm me the script? Been meaning to create one. I understand if no. I'll whip one together tomorrow and leaving a comment to remember to do so.

Nop. That's called burden of proof inversion. If you affirm something astonishing, you have to provide the proof. I cannot say that earth if flat and ask other people to prove me wrong. If I affirm such thing, I have to provide strong and unbreakable proof.

CTO at one of my former jobs would fuck with any unattended computer that was unlocked. He would set the home page of every browser they have to porn then come back when the person was there and say he needed to check something on their computer. Pull up a home page, find the porn and then freak out about it. Honestly, it was pretty effective. 
hello As we know that Python is a high level general purpose programming language which is very much useful in our Daily Life. there are many application which you can develop using python. If you have good skills then you can even develop Games which is very much interesting. Python can also be used to develop any kind of 3D application . Honestly saying we can use the knowledge of Python in many different field in our Daily Life .
Can you share pls :)

You're misunderstanding how open source works. &amp;#x200B; If you're unsatisfied with the pace of development, fork the repo and move it forward yourself. Your contributions will get merged if they win in the marketplace of ideas. 
&gt; Such as, using `b""` for most if not all string literals in the codebase. `b""` is used because, as far as I know, Redis strings are *binary strings* so I thought using `str` would be a wrong thing to do. &gt; As well as probably some weird usages of `collections`. I assume you mean my usage of `collection.deque`? The reason was simple: &gt; Deques support thread-safe, memory efficient appends and pops from either side of the deque with approximately the same O(1) performance in either direction. &gt; &gt; Though list objects support similar operations, they are optimized for fast fixed-length operations and incur O(n) memory movement costs for pop(0) and insert(0, v) operations which change both the size and position of the underlying data representation. &gt; &gt; https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque Indeed `dequeue` is the reason why `LPUSH/LPOP` and `RPUSH/RPOP` throughput is *symmetric*. ---- Regarding linters, thanks! I'll try to incorporate them when I have some time. =) 
You can probably save the output in graphite. I was doing something similar on my raspberry pi.
Okay....? Install the app like an absolute pleb.
No. It moves it by individual pixels. And it moves back and forth so you'd never know anything changed. 
&gt;You're misunderstanding how open source works. And I'd respectfully disagree and say that *you're* misunderstanding how open source works. :-) I'm one of the vast majority of people who aren't technically capable of moving the code forward myself. And the marketplace of ideas (I agree with you about that!) means that I back up and see if Ruby or Ruby or Kotlin or ... would be a better investment of my time.
Our tutor said wars are waged about what ide’s are used... all our assignments and exams are done in idle so we were told to stick to that ;) thank you though!!
Could I also have it please, thanks a lot!
This is a huge hack, and but in CPython, the builtin `id()` function is the memory address of an object. If you have a list to iterate over a lot, and the actual order doesn't matter, you can sort with `key=id` to potentially speed up the loop by reducing the number of cache misses when accessing elements of the list. Again, this is an implementation detail (`id()` required to be the memory address for other implementations) so don't rely on this to work everywhere.
First of all, I'd like to say that I sincerely appreciate the amount of effort you put into writing a lengthy comment. =) &gt; And this is without me even knowing anything about redis internals. There are probably dozens of other things that happen behind the scenes during a simple command. I think I can fully agree with your comment regarding the simplicity of **pydis** making this comparison useless. Trying to make tests more fair by implementing the benchmarked commands fully (even though those features might not be benchmarked at all [such as `EX/PX` and `NX|XX` of [`SET`](https://redis.io/commands/set)]). During that I've noticed that the performance dropped by some non-negligible amount after expiration support, which fully supports your argument. If there are any other "redis-lite" projects that you know of, maybe a comparison between them would be more fair. I think turning this into a competition would also be really fun! &gt; This uses `hiredis` to parse redis requests and it's written in C. No one doubts that Python can be snappy when a chunk of the heavily lifting is done in C. /u/LightShadow also mentioned the use of uvloop. I strongly disagree with this one, sorry. Perhaps because of my wording it might have sounded like I was trying to compare pure Python to C, but the idea is that through smart usage of Python (and smart being that optimising only what's necessary) you can have Python's advantages (over C) without having to program entirely in C. 
Lol I didn’t know that. Shows you how much I use Twitter 😂😂😂

My school usually assigned different registration dates for different people, and since I was a sophomore it meant that I often missed out on some cool electives because they would get booked so fast. So I made a python app using selenium to register for classes the second my registration period was open. I never missed out on a class I wanted to take for being booked up again. 
How did you get it to text your phone?
Since steam launched proton, I have been a complete fuckup! I have rediscovered skyrim. A heavily modded skyrim that doesn't like to shutdown. I found that through a ps aux | grep C: that told me that proton had started explorer file manager, to other .exe's and I think notepad. So instead of going through each process and kill it by PID I would do a import psutil as ps [x.kill() for x in ps.process_iter() if '.exe' in x.name()] and that is how I killed skyrim for forever until I needed a learn git project. Enter skyKill. I spent the last few days messing around with git from my linux box and a virtual machine to try to learn how not to be so fucking antisocial and I compiled a linux version and a windows version. For the most part its done. [Check it out](https://github.com/tetoNidan/skyKill) if you want it's absolutely pointless but a fun project to dink around on. As far as what project you should work on? I find myself asking myself that from time to time. I always have many projects going on. The ones I return to are the ones that challenge me to learn and figure out new ways to approach a problem. I almost always start projects that are well beyond my ability at the time. In fact this learn git project might be the only project that I really didn't need to look anything up about how to do x in python. It was fun and mostly a joke. I guess what im saying in my ramblings is pick a project that interests you. Make it a challenge. One thing I always do is dink around and build things for my OS. Like I didnt like the way network-manager handled ovpn connections. It was leaking ipv6 and it really wasn't network managers fault it was the way openvpn was handling domain resolution and there was a patch for it resolv.conf I think. Any way I decided to write my own network-manager and openvpn tool that lets me connect to any one of my 2000+ vpn connections. No more ipv6 leaks. I've been wanting to learn what python can do in blender. I think that would be a kick ass investment of time in python. It's very rewarding to do animation. And 3D is just cool. Kivy GUI is fun. Any way best of luck on your journey through python.
requests is a godsend You can do parallel requests with grequests
Recently I wrote a Telegram bot with Python and Flask that will send me a reminder that it's someone's birthday right before I step into the train. I don't use facebook and don't want to clutter my calendar so this is a lifesaver.

You could us email to send texts to phone. Something like 5556661234@vtext.com or something like that for Verizon. Might require some server setup like postfix. I made a motion detection alert security camera for my home like 5 or 6 years ago before i learned python using LAMP my and script was written in php and motion detection software called motion. When motion was detected it would fire off a text uising email then a snapshot of 4 images sent by email. All while syncing video to a dropbox folder. I dont know how they did theirs bit thats how i did mine.

Hello. You can find instructions on the theme's website: [https://draculatheme.com/jetbrains/](https://draculatheme.com/jetbrains/).

Hey, &amp;#x200B; what I've done so far is: \- It has give it text-to-speech functionality, so it speaks it messages to me out loud (pytssx used here). \- I made it calculate productivity numbers based on excel input (which takes quite some time everyday, but now will be automated). \- I can register/process money I took and add to my accounts, to keep me updated on balance \- It can do several things, just to see if I could get the different external modules to work. So, it can: move the console window around the screen, get summary of wikipedia pages, get the source-code of a page (input querie: URL) \- It can do some simple file handling: make a new (text) file with content, copy a file to another directory \- It can help me to log personal things in a diary, my pythonimprovements in a pylog I'm just adding things and functions that I'd like to try and things and functions which can help me with my job/life

Very nice. This could be a good use case of microservices perhaps?
I'm currently working on LED strips controlled by a raspberrypi-like computer using python. It's so simple to implement stylish patterns for the leds! 
Why is script2 async? It can block unit it receives a game state, then picks a move, then it sends it back. Why are you communicating over stdin instead of a network socket?

Python hardly has a GC that "kicks in". The generational GC in python only deals with reference cycles. Anything else gets collected the instant it falls out of scope, and not at some undefined time later.
Used Python, the cv library and an old laptop to make a ghetto security camera. The DIY camera was then pointed at some catfood left outside and found that the little brown shape that fled whenever it saw me was a little lost feral kitten. Knowing when she visited the food made trapping her with a rented cage very straightforward. Took her down to the local RSPCA shelter, and she's since been socialised and adopted by a family and now has a safe home of her own. [Shot from the 'camera'](https://imgur.com/a/MzBxHrV) 
No activity in a month and it's considered dead? When was the last time Microsoft Office updated?
Now try lexical analysis of 10+MB text files with PLY and GNU Flex and measure the difference. After you see "3 minutes vs fraction of a second" you'll realize you don't even need to measure it accurately - we're talking about order of a couple of magnitudes difference. Look. everyone who worked with Python likes the language - it's the one easy to like. But saying that it can be even remotely as fast as compiled C code is just ridiculous.
&gt;Why is script2 async? It can block until it receives a game state, then picks a move, then it sends it back. Because when i put code like this in script2: for line in sys.stdin.readline: if 'go' in str(line).strip(): sys.stdout.write(str(line).strip()+'bestmove'+'\n') script1 hangs as soon as i run it and doesn't print anything to the screen. Then ctrl+c gives KeyboardInterrupt line `x = script2.stdout.readline().strip()` after 'sent first go' &gt;Why are you communicating over stdin instead of a network socket? Because both files are on same computer. I got no response from /r/learnpython

Why flask?

Which languages? I’ve played around with ui files. They are cool but I eventually preferred to build ui’s manually. The C++ compiler in Designer is great though for creating plugins...
Technologically inferior open source solutions often win - e.g. because they have better marketing, bigger backers, etc.
I dont get why you're running script2 from script1. Are you trying to build a client/server game? Streams are sockets on unix, but you should use a TCP/IP socket for portability, to prevent weird behavior, and to give you the option of running on separate machines.
Well, some software performing intensive computations may perform on Linux quite faster, from 10 up to 50% IME - due to different compilers and their options, Linux kernel and libc being quite efficient, but 10x difference can only be explained by some module having a compiled binary on Linux but falling back to Python on Windows.
As I said, we do have couple engineers working remotely and we are used to working with our remote teams, so I think we are open to considering it on individual basis.
My first useful program was a telegram bot that would check position openings in local universities and if they match with my needs would alert me. It supported multiple users as well. 
I wrote a script to grab latest comments in my Instagram page and sent them to me in telegram so i don't miss any comment because of Instagram notification limitation.
I think a good start to propel these package owners would be to start telling the stories of the issues and pull requests here - e.g. "top 5 worst still open bugs on poetry". Wider community visibility into the dark corners of these packages will motivate the maintainers to fix them.
If you don't cast, the variable will be a string, isn't it? (in Python 3)
That's so cool!
Not resolving open PRs is often as much about putting off the awkwardness of rejecting other people's work. I don't think it's necessarily a good measure of how "in the weeds" a project is.

Has the same problem myself, but took a lazier route. Check out [Caffeine](https://www.zhornsoftware.co.uk/caffeine/). It periodically sends an F15 keyup, which interacts with almost nothing (except shell sessions in Putty, I've found) but still keeps the system awake. Don't even need admin privileges to start it up. :)
This may be useful to me in future when I've graduated and want to look for research positions etc. Thanks!
Ah, legally really dodgy, the porn part. Also very unprofessional. There are standard mechanisms for doing this - ones that don't involve viewing pornography at work (I mean, really - what is this guy thinking?) In every place I've been in that had such policies, there was a program called "cheese" that just locked your screen with a password that you didn't know, which forces you to walk over to the security people to get the password and get lectured.
Hi! I just published version 1.0.7 of the book with a fix of the no-ops. Thank you so much for reporting them.
source please :D
I am (begrudgingly) switching over to Python 3, but every package gets installed for both versions, often by mistake because 2 is the default on Ubuntu That may be one reason 2.7 is still so popular
I am building a chess engine program which will be running in another gui program (like [tarrasch gui](https://www.triplehappy.com/faq.html)) and they will communicate using UCI protocol. UCI protocol requires my program to at any point get strings via stdin and respond to specific stdin inputs using stdout. And i am pretty sure that script1 is working because it is able to communicate normally with existing chess engines (like [stockfish_10_x32.exe](https://stockfishchess.org/download/)). However my script2.exe blocks script1.py
If you've got Python installed and in your path, you can just type 'pip install &lt;mypackage&gt;' at the command line and it'll be installed into whatever python environment you have active. &amp;#x200B; I'm not sure what you're doing that requires you to ever type 'pywin32'. &amp;#x200B;
I copy this code but the turtle did not race. What could be wrong?
I probably didn't explain the project very well It is used for already done Ui's like lets say, you've built some UIs with qt designer and everything is in english but then you decide you need a german version of the ui. You could use this module to translate all of text inside Ui to german. My module reads .ui file and takes all text between &lt;String&gt; tags, then uses my other module for translating text (ptranslator) and replaces it. So basically you can translate any language that google translate can

What are you trying to do exactly?
The pywin32 was just an example. Whenever I type the package name ex. 'pip install pyhook' or something it gives me an error. But when I try typing the file's directory, it successfully imported. (Ex. pip install C:\User\Desktop\FolderSomething\PackageName Do you need internet for this? Because I was doing it offline. I just downloaded a wheel file

Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) has been around for two decades now and is the default audio format across many devices and services. AAC has been a mess for free software as a patent license is needed for all manufacturers/developers of AAC codecs. Projects like FFmpeg offer AAC support in source form but as a binary isn't legally permitted in US and other locations. 
It depends on what those calculations intend to do.. There are many intense calculations in the field of data science and AI, so here is a free, yet powerful setup; **Environment** - Anaconda : Allows you to create multiple workspaces with different packages and tools. Allows to have multiple python versions. Many packages included. Other packages can be installed using *pip* if not in their default list. - VSCode : A good text editor with lot of extensions. It's customizable and modern. Atom edutor is another such editor, however VSCode is faster in startup time and management overall. - Qt : For GUI applications. However, the default Tkinter Gui is good enough if your main focus is the application logic and not the looks of it. - Jupyter Notebook : Easier documentation that can be converted to md, html, text formats. Python snippets can be stored along with exolanation and run. It's *NOT* for coding. Just documenting the work for people who may want to refer to your work. **Processing** If you don't want to spend a lot buying a new hardware, you can rent cloud systems for it. A lot of options out there. VPS, Amazon AWS, Shared Cloud etc. If buying is not an option, then try to create multithreaded scripts and make the script get/store information in a bigger buffer. This is easily possible in C/C++, but for python i don't know because for intense calculations, Python is slowest language for me *personally*, so no hate here. Hooe this helps.

If you’re just looking for a side gig you’d be better off learning web design: Javascript, CSS, some database basics, bit of UI/UX design knowledge. You can usually find parttime jobs from small companies that need help designing a website. Python on its own probably isn’t enough to get you a job. It’s a good tool for automating work but the work it automates would be something that a full-timer is already doing. Even if a company was working on automation, they wouldn’t hire a consultant who only knows Python, they would hire someone with domain knowledge, or software engineering skills, or a BI developer for that kind of thing. That being said, python is good to have on a resume. It’s great for simplifying work that’s already being done in less efficient ways. It will probably help your job prospects for fulltime employment.
I keep getting requests for it, so I posted it below. The project's close to a year old, and most of this code I pieced together from something similar on a blog post (I don't know where), from some old posts on stack exchange, and bits from other places. Some of it's mine, but I don't know what. It uses speedtest-cli, so you'll have to install that. Anyway, make sure you use your own path name for the dir_path variable. You can schedule it to run however frequently you want through Windows' task scheduler. import os import re import subprocess import time import csv filename = 'speedtest.csv' dir_path = 'your/path/here' csv_path = dir_path + filename def speed_test(): response = subprocess.Popen('speedtest-cli --simple', shell=False, stdout=subprocess.PIPE).stdout.read() ping = re.findall(b'Ping:\s(.*?)\s', response, re.MULTILINE) download = re.findall(b'Download:\s(.*?)\s', response, re.MULTILINE) upload = re.findall(b'Upload:\s(.*?)\s', response, re.MULTILINE) ping[0] = ping[0].decode('utf-8') download[0] = download[0].decode('utf-8') upload[0] = upload[0].decode('utf-8') csv_entry(ping[0], download[0], upload[0], csv_path) def csv_entry(lat_st, down_st, up_st, path): result = time.strftime('%m/%d/%y'), time.strftime('%H:%M'), lat_st, down_st, up_st if not os.path.exists(dir_path): os.makedirs(dir_path) with open(path, "a", newline = '') as csv_file: writer = csv.writer(csv_file) if os.stat(csv_path).st_size == 0: writer.writerow(['Date','Time','Latency(ms)','Down(Mbit/s)','Up(Mbit/s)']) writer.writerow(result) speed_test()
You can always build this yourself from the Python source download. Or use ctypes to link directly to whatever C library you want from your Python script. Seems like yours would be a decent request for Python 3.8, which is getting released later this year.

No argument there. Everything about that company was legally dodgy and totally unprofessional. It was the kind of place where devs didn’t just solve a tough problem and say, “Nice work. That was really tough.” It was always, “hot damn, did we rape that code bitch into submission or what?!” It was a kind of wannabe sv-style startup. Trying to emulate the stories and culture you hear about at places like Uber, etc. That was probably one of the least offensive things that happened there. 
"Health of an open source project" is vastly more complicated than the hueristics you've reduced it to. You're making a couple of observations of complicated systems, developed with hundreds/thousands of hours and used by thousands of users and then making a decision on the health of that repo? That's not science. The best you can do is report your observations. 
Yes, based on image processing!
Please share the code! I'm learning python and would love to go through your code as a reference. Pretty please!!
Thanks, really appreciate it. Looking forward to getting into it later :)
@boramalper : Please, check my pure py3 redis clone : redys [https://github.com/manatlan/redys](https://github.com/manatlan/redys) I'd like to hear about performance vs yours, or real redis
I wrote a script that grabs DNS caches on my network that sends it to an email every 4 hours. Just so I can what's happening on my wifi :p
Last paragraph is the answer 😅. When you just do `pip install pyhook` it’s searching PyPI.org for the package, where it will then download automatically and install. No internet won’t work. When you give it the path to the file though it’s able to just install it from there, though it probably won’t be able to install any dependencies. 
Thanks! 
Me too
Sorry, I meant what do you actually do with the info? Is it just to check you're getting the speeds your isp says you will? 
Thanks a lot!
I guess I have two thoughts. First, somewhat tongue in cheek, no one ever "finishes" learning a programming language. ;) Second, machine learning is a really broad concept, and closely tied to a whole bunch of other "data analysis" skillsets. As to whether you should learn it "yet", it probably depends entirely on what you already know and why you want to learn machine learning. Assuming you have a good handle on the Python data basics (pandas, numpy, etc), the best suggestion I've heard about starting into data science type topics is to pick a data problem or project and try to learn how to solve it. Kaggle type problems can be good for this, as they usually have datasets etc to work with and a clearly defined problem that needs solving. You don't have to formally compete or anything, just look at a problem and try and solve it.
Andrew Ng has a fantastic course up on Coursera that teaches you the math behind ML and AI. They use octave/matlab in the course, but people have converted the course to Python, besides, if you learn how it works there's nothing stopping you from implementing it in any language.
Ohh. Thanks!
Are you writing the simulation code in Python?
I used flask + flask-socketio to turn any reddit post into a streaming post that will automatically show new comments. This way i don't have to constantly refresh on popular submissions to see new comments. 
It’s true that you can’t finish learning a language, just meant the basics :). Yeah, I forgot about numpy and panda. I’ll definitely take a look. Thanks again!
I’ll definitely look into it. Thanks for the response!

Is using something like Amazon Lambda out of the question? You don't have to invest in any hardware; just use the capacity you need when you need it. Depending on the type of calculations and how frequently you do them, you can turn this into OpEx rather than CapEx. Alternatively, you could look into the use of a GPU and Numba to shunt calcs over to them.
&gt; pydis is ~60% as fast as Redis &gt; using a faster parser in C with Python bindings Is this a joke?
I just updated the original post. Feel free to reach out with questions. I'd be happy to help!
How much RAM are we talking about you needing? Most consumer laptops top out at 16GB, and a some expensive higher end ones at 32GB. If you are talking about real hardcore data science work, most people aren't doing that on a laptop.
Are you doing more gpu or cpu processing? For normal python scripts more cpu is used. But for AI, especially ML, gpu is used. Nvidea CUDA is used by most python ML developers. Depending on that, you may buy a better graphics card. Usually Geforce Gtx is powerful even on laptop. Idk the reselling part honestly.
connect.commit() is commented out on line 57’ish
Oh wow yeah that's weird
To get an idea of what a ML project would look like from start to finish, check this [example](https://morioh.com/p/b56ae6b04ffc/a-complete-machine-learning-project-walk-through-in-python) out.
It's not free, but I highly recommend checking out Datacamp ([https://www.datacamp.com/](https://www.datacamp.com/)). I've done a lot of online python courses, and I have to say that I wish I'd started with Datacamp.
I see you list your job position as developer/data-scientist. This is exactly what fits my skillset. I am Msc Econ and Finance so a lot of data work and econometrics and I am also a developer, python, ios, node, solidity, etc. I would like a job that encompasses the statistical analysis of a data scientist and the programming / tools creation of a developer. Would be awesome if you could offer any advice on this type of role and how to find jobs like this. Thanks
First of all - machine learning is a huge field, and just doing a tutorial probably won't get you all that much. Best to try a project, or better yet find a job where you can start doing some light ML, so that you get practice with using it "in the wild". That said, I've really found [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291/) to be good, especially if you want to get into TensorFlow &amp; deep learning. 
For my take on how to implement a simple Redis clone with Python: http://charlesleifer.com/blog/building-a-simple-redis-server-with-python/ The point wasn’t to build a competitor to Redis, of course, but to show how to implement a simple socket server and protocol. Unlike the OP article, my post shows how simple it is to implement the Redis protocol.

I am interested in AI development and python is what is being used these days so I don't want it to create any problem or hindrance in my course. 
Wrote a script that every day scrapes a bunch of real estate website and makes a chart of houses with ranks. When a new home above a threshold appears It sends me a mail
Then stop counting hours and start learning.
The `time` module was created much earlier than `datetime`. Even then, I don’t think adding support for `timedelta` in `time.sleep` would be worthwhile.
[See if this helps.](http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-python/insert/) pretty much what you want to do is pass your sql statement and insert values as two separate arguments into your cursor.execute function. The link above should give you an idea on how to format your code to make that happen.

I just started the fast.ai course and so far I like it a lot. It takes a top-down approach where you first start tackling real-world problems and then gradually dive more into the details. 
How does it differentiate between you and your colleagues? 
How do you learn best? By watching videos? By following tutorials? By reading a book? By jumping right into a project? There’s lots of different ways to learn (and a tutor wouldn’t be in my top 10!). I don’t like learning from videos but there are lots of (free or v. cheap) online courses. There are great books like python for data science. There are really good sites like realpython. Let us know what you’re looking for and people will point you towards some of the best places to look.
Trust me i am well aware of that but being a student i need a fixed time schedule to do this so i already have my hands full with exams and shit. And i want to learn it within 3 months and that's like 270 hrs of python. So i want to know is it possible or do i need to increase my time frame.

Responding to a few comments requesting code. The script is below. Simply make it run on login, or find a place in your actual motd sequence. Whatever. The actual fetching of posts takes about 500ms. Not an issue in my case, however I had considered writing a simple caching system so the script would start out by reading a file line for line. If it was blank, fetch 100 since we´re doing that already and pour them into our database. Then just remove the printed line. It would certainly remove the small chance for repetition. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; import praw import random &amp;#x200B; \#nice try r=praw.Reddit(client\_id, client\_secret, user\_agent="showerthought MOTD grabber") &amp;#x200B; \#get a random post from this many -1 options \#-1 is for the sticky, what is a showerthought.

The only thing I've done with python in android is just the app Pydroid 3 so I can play around with code a bit. I haven't really done much on this front.
&gt;Should I even teach myself machine learning yet? Why not? I taught my self machine learning in the 90's using Pascal. It's infinitely easier now with Python and all the libraries. I tried using Tensorflow from Google. But I now use PyTorch. It's much easier to code, lighter and more flexible. There are lots of examples on the PyTorch web site. But if you really want to learn about the topic, you need to come up with a fun project of your own. I've been playing with music. I've got a large collection to work from and to me it's more interesting than any of the canned projects out there. Learn NumPy. Check out SkLearn. And definitely learn PyTorch.

I have some programs I wrote for work that open files, modify them and then spit them out in another format. I also have a lot of automated backup utilities I've been working on. There is a screen automation program I've been experimenting with using pyautogui and it's nice to have subprocess to do certain things while that's running. Another thing I used it for (bad programming tip here): I had a need to run a bunch of python files in a row and didn't have the time to rewrite them all with a main method and imports. I used subprocess to run them all in a chain. This is much slower than the proper way, but it gets the job done in a pinch.
Holy shit you are a lifesaver dude i was about to just give up. Thanks

Basically i want to create a program which gathers data based from you search history to predict your interests. So can it be done by the use of python? And as i am a complete noob at this so i want to know can i learn enough python in 270 hrs( considering my average is good enough) to pull this off.
It can be done, yes. How good it will be will depend on the quality of your data though.
yeah it might make sense to write in pypy... /s &amp;#x200B; Get it down with tests, make the tests pass, make it fast. In that order.

FYI there’s also just a setting in Skype for how long to wait until setting your status to idle.
I was in the same boat a few months back. Trust me, directly jumping to ML without having much Python experience won't harm you much. I bought Jose Portilla's ML course on Udemy. It is really wonderful and gets you started. Won't cost you much, $10. https://www.udemy.com/share/1000YsAkoceF1TRHo=/ I then went on to pursue his Tensorflow course. 
I’m using Twilio which gives me a phone number to text from. I’m only using their free trial version so it has its limitations but it gets the job done. 
I mean that you're going to want machine learning for this, and a lot of that depends on the quality and quantity of your training data.

The book is absolutely amazing. 
what programs do I need to download to use your code? For example use your news scraper for Reuters if I want to modify it? I am new to this stuff and only know Jupyterhub and am confused what shells I should be using, what databases do I need, how do I write scripts to interface with the internet as I am on a mac? Sorry for the million questions 
No that's not the behaviour, the implementation is in th `_monitor` function, in case of an ApiException, the monitor will sleep for `sleep_interval` and then try a watch mechanism again.
Assignment expressions can only target an identifier, as well. They don’t trigger __getitem__() or __setitem__() ; they only bind names. And they don’t allow packing/unpacking. Given that arbitrary object oriented magic can take place beneath a call like a[0] = 1 or a.b = 2 I think this is a good limitation. As crazy as assignment expressions might become, they could be far crazier if this was possible.
There is several job postings at [jobs.kiwi.com](https://jobs.kiwi.com) , just search for "anal" for positions in our \_analytics team\_ that among other things tries to gain insights into the travel market or figure out the dynamics of airfare across seasons, events and anomalies.

I'd just use pandas. Capture the speed, pass to a dataframe, convert to CSV and write to file. Use averages/means of column showing speed rate and then bitch on Twitter about the shitty service you're getting.
It's really good. [Here is a resource for doing the course in python](https://towardsdatascience.com/andrew-ngs-machine-learning-course-in-python-neural-networks-e526b41fdcd9), rather than octave.
Don’t like it? Use Go instead.
Look into ibm watson studio for deep learning on the cloud. It's going to be expensive and wasteful to make your own gpu enabled cluster. Just use a managed one like watson studio, or similar cloud product. 
Highly reccomend fast.ai. they have both ml/DL courses and both are excellent. They are taught top down so u get to start working with models immediately, and also put a higher emphasis on python programming instead of theory.
The most important part about learning anything is just find something that's good enough and stick with it. Don't be concerned about what's the best way to get to your goal, or you'll find yourself constantly switching between the 'best sources' and never get there.
That’s cool. Those look like fun projects. Do you have a front end of some kind or is it a command line app?
It's just an example. Sometimes, you'll have arguments coming from a different source, and unpacking is better than writing `test_function(foo[0], foo[1], foo[2])`.
For starters you could do something like `if y.any(1,3,5,7,8,10,12): d = 31`

You shouldn't really be using the base environment for anything, so if your not in a working/project environment, just `conda deactivate` to remove the `(base)`. You can also turn off the prompt change entirely with conda: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36499220/anaconda-disable-prompt-change If you really want `(base)` to not be shown when you're in a certain directory, you'll have to write a custom script/function to do that for you.

I found the data school channel on YouTube was very helpful. I was trying to get into it and for some reason watching his videos finally made it click. 
True, but also don't take screenshots of code.
Right, but why not just wrote `test_function(*foo)` ? You're assuming the source has 3 arguments, anymore and you get a `TypeError`. 
I see the point you are trying to make here but either I couldn't articulate myself well or you are missing my point: I am not saying that vanilla/pure Python is as fast as C (which is an absurd claim of course), but trying to show by example that for many cases, where network or memory bounds are non-negligible, Python can perform just as considerably well, even if it's not on par. I am trying to make people consider twice whether the loss in productivity and increase in the effort spent on any project by taking decisions blindly is indeed worth X% increase in the performance. How much would it cost to start a second server vs hiring another programmer? Lastly, please don't take it as a criticism of redis or any other software project written in C. I am just using it because it's famous for its speed.

That's if your function arguments are defined as separate variables. But what if you're, say, loading them from JSON? Or using `str.split` on user input?
After the first few hundred hours he will learn :-) We all did
When a button is pressed they are recorded as two separate events. I chose three letters and initialized a variable at 0. Every time one of those three buttons are "pressed" I add 1 to the variable and every time they are released I subtract 1. If at any event the sum is 3 (e.g. the three letters are pressed and not released) the script skips the freezing and recording and just locks the computer, after which I log in normally. I could hard code a password to end the script but I figured that wouldn't be secure. I just press the three letters and lock the computer then log in. At most adds 1-2 seconds. Also, you can only get any single person a couple of times at most. I'm thinking about an experiment where after some time I just leave my computer as is and don't run the script. I wonder if they'll still be inclined to pull a prank.
VsCode for when I don’t have pycharm installed or simpler needs otherwise pycharm
You can't argue that Python3 is efficient while you try to speed it up by replacing it with C. C is not the "strength" of inefficient interpreted languages. C is a competitor.
Yes, I originally made it to check to see if I was getting what I paid for and if my ISP was throttling me. As it turns out, even with the data from this script, determining what your speed actually is or whether you're being throttled is a lot more difficult.
Or use find to delete files older than x hours 
I get what you're saying, but for me anyways, using the positional arguments seems like the way to go instead of unpacking the collection hoping for 3 arguments.

I second this. Fast.ai is built on top of pytorch and while infinity customizable it has done much of the model configuration and hyperparameter tuning based on research and best practices, so you can get really good results in just a few lines of code. As you gain more and more insight into how things work, you can customize models and parameters to your objective. I’d start with the ML course, then move on to the DL course for more advanced (but still easy to implement) techniques. Once you understand the basics, kaggle is a great way to test your knowledge and implementation as it allows you to compare your model performance to others. Not to mention, many kagglers upload their models which can be a great source for ideas. 
Just so you know, that's not a PyCharm thing, that's a computer keyboard thing.

https://youtu.be/KnBntO0wayk Chris talks about authing with requests late in this vid. With requests sites can be very finicky, but with selenium most sites have trouble distinguishing between a bot and a user. Best approach is to use fiddler to monitor traffic while you drive around. Sometimes you have to supply header information, sometimes you must supply a referring address. Like most things there is no substitution for experience, you'll get better the more you do it so just keep at it.
/r/learnpython AND READ THE SIDEBAR
The question is not particularly meaningful. This is like asking "Is aluminum an airplane?" Yes, if you arrange it correctly. Turning completeness according to Wikipedia is defined as "a system of data-manipulation rules (such as a computer's [instruction set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set), a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language), or a [cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton)) is said to be **Turing complete** or **computationally universal** if it can be used to simulate any [Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine). " &amp;#x200B; So, if you write a complicated enough one-liner filled with lambdas, you probably could make a turning machine simulator.
thx!
It's also super helpful to use .lower() on user input if you don't care about upper/lower case - that way a similar code with often capitalized units like Watts or BTU can be handled case insensitively.
Yes, and I'm asking if what is provided (the instruction set provided) in one single line of python by itself when used with a python compiler with basic python syntax can be used to simulate any Turing machine... This is not stack overflow, you don't have to start every answer with "this is a useless question", especially if its to copy paste Wikipedia afterwards. 
Ooh, and you can make your prompt generate the options list from the dictionary. Then you can add new options by modifying the dictionary alone! I'm getting excited... options = ','.join(converter.keys()) mode = input(f'Enter starting unit ({options}): ')

Yeah other people have posted before I had time to get to my desktop, but mine looks like this: &gt; \#while(True): &gt; &gt;\# [pyautogui.press](https://pyautogui.press)('ctrl') &gt; &gt;\# time.sleep(30) &amp;#x200B;
There's also this: [https://pypi.org/project/google-images-download/](https://pypi.org/project/google-images-download/) which works pretty well.
Python itself is Turing complete. By definition, a Turing complete machine can simulate a Turing machine. So yes, you can construct a Turing machine in a Turing machine. Which is what I said in my original response: &gt; if you write a complicated enough one-liner filled with lambdas, you probably could make a turning machine 
I'm still not understanding. Are you asking if its possible to write a turing complete one-liner?
You might want to look into a dictionary
Sounds horrible, lol. 
But you're not using \`collections.deque\` as far as I can tell. You're importing it, but at no point are you calling it. Somewhere in your codebase you've defined deque as a variable, which looks like its just a dict.

You could make your own Spark cluster at home, and use PySpark to distribute your workload. I don’t know why anyone would go through the headache of buying all that and setting it up at home instead of just using a cloud service though.

I guess? I don't know why on Earth you would want to subject yourself to that. I'd imagine that, also, with the release of Python 3.8, such a thing would be "easier", but that doesn't mean you should.
Yes it can, the question is can it do it in one line (despite it having no practical applications), and if it can, then how to proove it (not only with a "probably")
Can you post the clipboard program? I was just trying to make something like that, but was having trouble.
I just look up a specific tensorflow bit every now and again if Keras doesn't have it. Then I just use it within an otherwise entirely Keras-written network. I haven't yet encountered situations where this approach doesn't work.
Because the language puts restrictions on when to jump to a new line, and I have been rewriting basic stuff in one line and I was wondering if you could do just about anything with it, out of curiosity, and how we can proove it. Don't know how 3.8 changes that, i'll look it up.

Python 3.8 comes with the addition of the `:=` operator, which can be used in things such as list comprehensions, lambdas, ternary conditions, etc.
Lets make a project together. I kniw how to do it completely, but need someone to get motivated to code it. Dont want to do all the scraping &amp; analysis code alone. Maybe call your friends and we make a github group to make it. Willing to help &amp; provide all resources.
Thanks a lot, that's even better than what I expected, was thinking of a function with only a return line + ternaries but that's amazing

&gt;You shouldn't really be using the base environment for anything, so if your not in a working/project environment, just conda deactivate to remove the (base). While a it's a good rule of thumb, it is not always correct. Not everyone uses Python for project-based work. My main work using Python is for data science hence why Anaconda's base distribution is the proper environment for me. Within data science work, the packages rarely change except the occasion of having to use specific database packages.
Proving it is waaaaay beyond my technical skill. It'd be very complex. I knew someone who wrote an entire IRC server in one line using nested lambdas, so I'm highly confident it's possible. Just non-trivial.
The question doesn't really seem to make sense except as a matter of pure interest - essentially what you're asking seems to be: "Is the subset of python with no ability to create new lines of code still Turing complete?". The answer, by the way, is yes. The simplest way to achieve that is with [exec](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec) which lets you take enve constructs in python that need newlines, and make it representable on a single line of code in python. Ex: exec("class Foo:\n pass\n\nfoo = Foo()") works just fine. You can also chain a lot of code that would otherwise require new lines into one line with `;` x = 10; print(x) is functional. 
Absolutely start with something like a kaggle contest: Titanic is great for starters. One of the more difficult thing about machine learning is translating a problem into a specific input, target and error metric. This has already been done for you in a kaggle project, so you can focus on learning about the actual machine learning. (Then when you have a good handle on what ML can and can't do, you'll be able to turn a problem into input, target and error metric)

Hi there! OP here. &amp;#x200B; I started this project nearly two years ago and I enjoy contributing to it. Some of the users of this project are **pandas,** **scikit-image,** **spyder-ide, sunpy, astropy** and **scikit-learn-contrib** communities. I love the constant feedback by the users and the ways to improve upon the software. &amp;#x200B; I am looking for more people and organizations to try this out. Let me know about your preferences and opinions :)
The likelihood that this is usable as-is are low. This user has a long history of posting links to other peoples repositories regardless of usability for what can only be assumed as "karma whoring" purposes.
If you're doing data analysis then Jupyter. 
This is my favorite practical ML book. A second edition with keras is coming out in the summer. 
It can be extremely useful. Here's one example off the top of my head: def my_func(first, second, third=None, fourth=None, fifth=None, sixth=None, seventh=None): pass # function body my_args = {'first': 5, 'second': 6} if some_condition: my_args['third'] = 2 my_result = my_func(**my_args) The function I defined has many optional arguments. Let's say that I populate these arguments based on many conditions. If I didn't use a dictionary like this, then I could have many, many unique calls to my function. If I change the function signature, then each call to the function would need to be changed. By using a dictionary to store arguments, I now only need to call the function once: after I've assembled the argument dictionary. If I change the function signature, then I only have one function call to adjust. Plus, I know the exact spot the function was called. If I have: if some_condition: result = my_func(a1, a2, third=a3) elif another: result = my_func(a1, a2, fourth=a3) Now I have many places that my_func may have been called. If I have to debug which was called, now I need to figure out which condition was triggered. If I have one call, all I need to debug is just a log of the argument dictionary. Another point is reducing error: look at the required arguments. If I use an argument dictionary, I have these only defined in one single place. By having multiple unique calls to the function, I have to type these in multiple spots, which could increase the potential for error: my_args = {'first': a1, 'second': a2} # above has first and second defined in one place, versus: if some_condition: result = my_func(a1, a2, third=a3) elif another: result = my_func(a1, a2, fourth=a3) The former has a1 and a2 used once. What if, in the latter, I mistype a2 as a1 because I use poor variable names? Imagine if I had a large number of calls, and each have the potential for error. Less typing means less potential for error
Or use a good datetime library like *pendulum*. 
What software do you race in? I had a quick google, and assumed simracer was it - but it seems like that's the genre :) &amp;#x200B; I also saw a news article that someone recently beat a real F1 driver in simulation - how accurate are these simulators?
&gt; but trying to show by example that for many cases, where network or memory bounds are non-negligible, Python can perform just as considerably well, even if it's not on par. I see. Now if *all* Python applications would run 100x slower than compiled C code, no one would use it. There is a lot of applications where the interpreter's performance isn't the bottleneck. With Web applications being the largest bunch, provided the application is a thin layer between the database and http server. Yup. Point taken. But I don't know - are there really people around who didn't realize that? I thought it was kind of bloody obvious. Performance analysis and tuning was always about finding the bottlenecks.

\&gt; I strongly disagree with this one, sorry. Perhaps because of my wording it might have sounded like I was trying to compare pure Python to C, but the idea is that through smart usage of Python (and smart being that optimising only what's necessary) you can have Python's advantages (over C) without having to program entirely in C. &amp;#x200B; Here you are wrong though. Because the moment you would need to go back to change something in the lower level part, you're not writing Python anymore. &amp;#x200B; So I find this more correct, personally: &amp;#x200B; \&gt; This uses hiredis to parse redis requests and it's written in C. No one doubts that Python can be snappy when a chunk of the heavily lifting is done in C.

&gt; You shouldn't really be using the base environment for anything... &gt;&gt; While a it's a good rule of thumb, it is not always correct. No, you should not be using the base environment for anything -- [it's in the docs](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#managing-environments), and if you break the base env, you break conda and have to remove and reinstall. So, even if you have a kitchen-sink/master environment where you do all your work, it shouldn't be the base environment. 
@ryeguy: dude, congrats, you're so patient dealing with these people. &amp;#x200B; To add to your argument: sure, python could leverage C, but the moment you need to change anything in the lower-level part, it's not Python anymore. So indeed, the argument "for" Python, is invalid.
Thanks that might get me where I’m hoping

When looking for daycare for our son, I wrote code to scrape the state and county websites of registered daycare providers. I ran all of the addresses through a geocoord resolving service to get lat/longs. Then I grabbed an API key for Google maps and used it to get the drive times from our house (this was important because some places that are close as-the-bird-flies are actually quite a drive because of nearby streams and forests). The drive time and filters for start time, number of violations, and meals provided got the list several hundred dollars to just a handful.
Not op, but he is using git, which is a version control system. You should really be using one for anything more than a basic script. Install git, and git clone (url here) from a command line. Then just navigate to the folder containing the script and run python3 (filename here).py. To interface with the internet, a dead simple way to make requests, is the request library. To parse HTML you can use bs4. And if your page has dynamic Content, you could try selenium. But really if you skim automate the boring stuff it should go over most of it 
Well I'm relatively experienced in game hacking/reverse engineering and a decent knowledge of windows apis, not so in Python win32 FFI. But what game is it?

I apologize, I still do not agree that I am not allow to touch the base environment. Conda documentation is also notorious for being outdated and missing information (e.g., where is the documentation for `conda init` ). That one paragraph in the docs: &gt;When you begin using conda, you already have a default environment named base. You don't want to put programs into your base environment, though. Create separate environments to keep your programs isolated from each other. is absolutely vague. What's the point of the default distribution of Anaconda if you're not going to use any of its pre-installed packages. &amp;#x200B; &gt; So, even if you have a kitchen-sink/master environment where you do all your work, it shouldn't be the base environment. Except I am not dealing with kitchen-sink or any sort of project. I am the consumer that Anaconda was made for (Python programming in data science) hence the base distribution was curated for Data science (see [What is Anaconda?](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/)). &amp;#x200B; &gt; if you break the base env, you break conda and have to remove and reinstall. Conda is a completely isolated program in the base environment (i.e., `/anaconda/bin/conda` and `/anaconda/libs/python3.x/conda` . If you were to somehow break conda you can easily reinstall it with pip. &amp;#x200B; Additionally new environments made by conda are not dependent on the base environment except for the Python version of the base environment &amp;#x200B; Lastly, "We are consenting adults". Use the base environment if you can use it responsibly. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;

i get your point about the "awkwardness" from personal experience with tiny projects on github :) &gt; PRs are almost irrelevant to many projects as well - the overall health depends upon the primary maintainer more than anything else. that's exactly the point, imho. if the primary maintainer lets PRs "rot" in the waiting list, that is not a _sign_ of good "health". it is an _indicator_ that something is not working as it should; the reasons can be manifold, but they become visible via a list of open issues or PRs: - you are right; PRs could be simply irrelevant for the project: in that case all should be closed and no new ones be accepted - there could be no time to review: not a good sign for "health", the project needs more trusted, engaged developers! - or a design decision is outstanding: not a good sign, primary maintainer should maybe seek advice on what to do, discuss with peers and make a decision! - etc. a project with clear rules on PRs and the people/time to work on them, does not have a long PR backlog.

&gt; It’s obviously not meant to compare pure Python with C. Is that why you lied about your "redis clone" being written in "Python 3" to "disprove some falsehoods about performance"? Your position is indefensible and your methods are intellectually dishonest.
If you want a job doing ML, you have many levels: a. learning basic python b. learning basic applications of ML using python c. applying the concepts of b. to a pet project. d. understanding the theoretical underpinnings of ML e. having novel insights when prompted. Maybe once you are at e. you can be a credible candidate for a job. The trickiest is d., which is the math. Optimization theory, graph theory, linear algebra - be familiar at some level with these, and any good ML-focused text book will give you what you need to know.

I guess this question should better be posted on r/learnpython. That having said, it sound like you could just use a default value for your argument: `def my_function(arg_one, arg_with_default=[1,2,3])`. The often used `**kwargs` argument is nothing more then a dictionary with a variable number of keyword arguments: def my_function(**kwargs): print(kwargs) # or when you want to access a specific variable you would use kwargs["arg_name"] # If you want to see if an keyword argument was supplied and apply a default value # you could use: kwargs.get("optional_arg_name", [1,2,3]) where the list with 1, 2, 3 is # the default value my_function(a=1, b=2, c=3) # this will print {"a":1, "b":2, "c":3}

I agree with what you're saying, and I fully understand that the above sample is just an example demonstrating tuple unpacking (in the OP), but what I'm saying is, you have a function that takes 3 parameters, why then would you use a tuple, dictionary, or list, which could potentially have more than 3 arguments and cause your program to crash? My whole, they're are better examples of tuple unpacking, this **isn't** one of them (Dan's example).

OP wants advice about learning to code in python. The thing is, starting to code in C is a good idea, as it forces you to understand the underlying architecture of computers (memory, allocation, addresses,etc...). But in contrast, starting with Java can be bad, as it’s masking memory management, and more.
I would recommend searching /r/learnpython for posts on the best Python books, or just googling it with reddit in the title. You'll find lots of suggestions. From there I would choose a book suited for beginners and work away. I also recommend using YouTube videos. I personally like [sendex](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex)and [thenewboston](https://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston)'s content.
You should use `def f(*args)` if you expect homogeneous items, and don't know how much will. but in case `def g(args)` it's not so convenient: `f()` instead `g(tuple())` or `g([])` `f(1)` instead `g((1, ))` (NOT g((1)) !) Etc. Without *args you have more chance to do errors
Right, exactly, which is what I stated above. I'm just saying the code from Dan is a bad example, but not many people will realize it. Some may think that you require a fixed set of arguments for unpacking to work, which isn't true. 
That place never answers anything. I think the learn python reddit is better. Posting on that reddit is like posting in a black hole. 
what?
Small question here, you seem to know about this. I have heard that python and other languages that are used for this thing, are only used to create the models, once that's done those models are usually integrated into C++, C, Java and sometimes Rust because those languages are far better at performance than Python or R. Do they do that? I am a big fan of Rust.

What version are you on? Their [page on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/celery/) indicates that it's designed to work on 3.5 and 3.6 (and probably higher) and that they're sunsetting Python 2.7 support.
I am working on finding a programmer to get these jobs done I so deperately need so I can finally become a millionaire. Hit me up!
It's impossible to help you unless you describe the exact problem you're having in detail.
That's true. I guess, the important safeguard is that if your function is made just for your use, you make sure not to have data that will cause this issue. Otherwise, if it's for public use and you're concerned about this, you then can use `**kwargs` in your function signature: def my_func(first, second, third=None, *args, **kwargs): By doing this, additional arguments or keyword arguments will will be captured in the `args` list and `kwargs` dictionary. This is clearer than just accepting a single argument, because the data to be passed to the function is more explicit. By accepting just a single argument, you can indeed have the behaviour you describe, but then your function is less self-documenting, and now you need to document how to pass data, rather than letting the function document this itself. I definitely understand the concern you'd like to address, but I think python has the infrastructure built in to address it

If you want less math and more SWE/ML the fast.ai course is pretty solid.
Great question! This a space I'm very interested in learning about, thanks for reminding me!
Now I didn't use Python for that, but only because I didn't know Python back then(you could do it with Python): small webapp based on Google Forms and Google Docs to make a uniform "there's a Test of kind abc on Date xyz in subject ijk" synced across the calendars of everyone in class to prevent complete chaos
I'm most concerned about good PRs from the community not getting merged. 
That is also true --- Vanilla Javascript persists, well, because it's guaranteed to be there.
I'm watching this thing like a hawk, so if it breaks just comment and I'll delete the post. 
That's a good idea. Transparency and sunlight are great remedies. I think the maintainers may not realize the extent of some of the issues.
So I finally gave Conda a try, installed via pyenv. It kicks ass --- I was able to convert a poetry-based config to it, and it works much better. In poetry several things were wonky: \`python\` vs \`ipython\` behaved differently (ipython could find the installed modules, but python couldn't). And running VS Code in the poetry-controlled environment was very tricky to get right, and I'd often mess it up. But going with Conda and following the tutorial, everything "just works". I 'activate' the environment, and everything picks up the new configuration and packages. The only issue I found is that the docs are a bit buried to learn how to create a text file with the dependencies, to make it reproduceable. But it's there, and possible.

&gt;"Health of an open source project" is vastly more complicated than the hueristics you've reduced it to. This is definitely true. For me, scratching my itch, it's a step up from poking around a GitHub repo to see last commit, stars, or whatever else I think of to check. I've got a [list of ideas](https://github.com/dogweather/repo-health-check/blob/master/README.md#development-status): ## Automated Signals Quantitative measurements which can determine *qualitative* assessments. * Num. of active branches * merged * un-merged * Num. of stale branches * merged * un-merged * Num. of open pull requests * proportion open:closed pull requests * aging of pull requests * Num. of open issues * proportion open:closed issues * Num. of stars * Num. of forks * Num. of subscribers * ratio of # of tags to # of tags in use ### Intermediate Metrics By using the raw signals listed above, we can calculate useful metrics. These metrics, then, will be the pieces that can form a judgement for the big questions. E.g.: * How well do the maintainers keep up with the queue of incoming PR's? * How quick do the maintainers respond to new issues and PR's? * How does the activity level affect the other metrics?
The GitHub repo is just a read-only mirror. All the development happens with patches. (via email?) Take a look at the PRs. [They all have the same auto-answer](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/651#issuecomment-463803093): &gt;Thanks for your contribution to the Linux kernel! &gt; &gt;Linux kernel development happens on mailing lists, rather than on GitHub &amp;#x200B;
Lol, it's not that you're "not allowed" too, it's that it's *bad practice* to do so. Sure, maybe you don't need to install anything now, and that the base andaconda distribution has everything (and more than) you need, but that's unlikely to always be so. So get into good software habits now. &gt; what's the point of the default distribution of Anaconda if you're not going to use any of its pre-installed packages. Yes, the default distribution comes with a curated selection of the most common DS and scientific python packages. When you create a new environment with those packages, *you don't have to download them* (conda links to them and places them in your new environment), so by including them, they are providing you a "batteries included" platform that works offline. It's by no means saying you should just use the base packages directly. &gt;Conda is a completely isolated program in the base environment (i.e., /anaconda/bin/conda and /anaconda/libs/python3.x/conda . If you were to somehow break conda you can easily reinstall it with pip. Lol, no. See the warning here: https://pypi.org/project/conda/. &gt; Except I am not dealing with kitchen-sink or any sort of project. If you're just working from the base environment, you're using a kitchen-sink environment (include everything I need, everything I don't need, and the kitchen sink too!) &gt; Additionally new environments made by conda are not dependent on the base environment except for the Python version of the base environment Actually, it's not dependent on the python version either. You can create a python 2 environment from anaconda 3, for example. conda itself is dependent on having a base environment with the right python and packages and versions (and when you upgrade conda, you want that environment to not have any conflicts!), but it can create whatever environment you want, including a pythonless environment! *That's kinda the whole point.* &gt; Lastly, "We are consenting adults". Use the base environment if you can use it responsibly. Yes, you can do whatever you want. That doesn't mean that you *should* do it. And directly using the base environment *is not responsible*. 
If you run into performance issues you obviously need to change the tech stack. But Python is good enough most of the time, especially given that it is often simply an abstraction layer placed between you, and something faster (as in Tensorflow).
A git "link" is called a repository. He linked his up there.

Nice idea man. Anyway I wanna know is python not really match for C is we consider developing games ?
It is highly related. I have a friend who likes analog stuff. I show them all of the same digital sensors that can do the same they're doing now, and talk about how it will cut down on the paper and time spent inputting it into their own spread sheet. No deal. They're also only a few years older than I am, so it's not like they don't understand tech... 
 `test_dict = {1:'a', 2:'b', 3:'c'}` `def show_value(i, test_dict):` `if i in test_dict:` `print(test_dict[i])` `if i not in test_dict:` `print(i + " is not a valid key")` `show_value(3, test_dict)`
It depends on the type of games. For 2D stuff pygame is great, but I would recommend unity or smgt similar in C++ for anything bigger

You’ll need git on your pc. Once installed use “git clone” to download the repo. 
You probably need to use BaseHttpServer module instead, which contains the BaseHTTPRequestHandler to override GET\_\* methods. &amp;#x200B; Now, the use of this module is not recommended for production [https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Please you post your code that is not working along with the website you got it from. 
the `random` module has a function just for picking out a random element in a `Sequence`: `choice`. So that last line could be `print(random.choice(hot).title)`
So if I'm understanding correctly this is so that your list gets sorted consistently (but not necessarily meaningfully, at least to a human), and extremely quickly?
Nice...better than mine.
Current version of celery on PyPI is incompatible with Python 3.7 due to "async" becoming a keyword. You can either downgrade to Python 3.6 or you can upgrade celery from master repo on github using pip install --upgrade https://github.com/celery/celery/tarball/master 
It's not about the sorting, it's about sequentially accessing elements from a list. If you access memory addresses that are far away from each other, the CPU has to spend extra time copying from RAM to the CPU cache first. (This is called a cache miss.) If you access memory addresses that are close together, you can probably get away with just reading directly from the cache.

Good to know - thanks! I think I've come across iRacing before and, with the mindset that it was a game, thought the subscription model was rather odd. OTOH, it would make something as serious as a simulator more accessible - cool stuff!
i wrote some code to generate a spotify playlist from the songs that were playing on a few sirriusxm stations. it was backed by a sqllite db to manage last time the song was played on that station so i could prune inactive songs. i wasn't sure that we were going to keep sirriusxm after the trial period but we did so in the end i didn't end up using it.
Have you tried switching backend to phantomjs or alike? Check this list too https://github.com/dhamaniasad/HeadlessBrowsers/blob/master/README.md
i just don't use classes as much as i maybe should
In normal scripting tasks, classes aren't used much. I generally use classes when I'm organizing some Python project, for example, python packages, django projects, etc.
I'm not liking the idea of switching back to 3.6.
 python -m http.server The *ad hoc* web server is probably one of the most useful features I've ever encountered ever. 
You could also use selenium with headless chrome. It’s got a little bit of a learning curve but it can do anything chrome can. 
Tried that too. It's just as slow
Not if you don’t want any external dependencies. If you don’t mind that though then [prompt-toolkit](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit) is a _much_ more sophisticated option.
Yeah, I saw that I had a little trouble finding documentation on how to use it... But I might just be an idiot. I don't have a huge issue using external dependencies.
[Oh wait, I am.](https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
The documentation is [here](http://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), but if you scroll down the README on GitHub at the previous link you’ll find links to a bunch of projects that use it, starting with the demo ptpython project... those are very helpful on seeing how to wire it up.
Yeah, I just found that. LITERALLY THE SECOND GOOGLE RESULT Clearly, my brain just skipped right over it. I will look into all of those, bits of info. Thanks!

Well 199 $,, aint you a clever boy colt
Your question as it is written is impossible to answer. Depending on your needs the costs could be anywhere from tens of dollars for an always-on Raspberry Pi server, up to multi-millions for a custom built supercomputing cluster built by IBM. And this is only for traditional hardware. Nowadays there are virtual clusters, clusters-as-service, etc. All of these have so many options and additional fees that all will depend on what **you** actually need. When you can answer the following questions then someone can give you an answer. If you can't answer it, then it means that you actually have no idea what you need and so nobody can tell you how much it will cost. 1. Are you IO bounded? CPU bounded? RAM bounded? 2. Do you need GPU acceleration? What flavor? 3. Is your problem parallelized? Can it be parallelized? If so, what kind of parallelization paradigm? 4. Do you need ECC RAM? 5. How "intensive" is your project? You say intensive but this alone means nothing, and it will mean something totally different to a person who specializes in computing hardware or does any work with one. For example the code I work with does "intensive" calculations, which by that I mean it literally takes weeks upon weeks to finish computing. I'd say that's intensive, but for example I TA for a class and my students say thing like "it took me so long to run the code, like 2 hours." I would be so freakin happy if my code took "only" 2 hours to run. 6. Have you benchmarked any of your code? Have you tried scaling the code up to multiple cores already and calculating speed up with Amdahl's Law?
So im doing a unit conversion program but idk how to start it. Basicly I need to ask the user to input a value with a unit. Like this: Enter a value and units, separated by a space: 12 m The program needs to distinguish between the string (m) and the float (12) and be able to identify (m) as a unit of length in order to convert the float into km, mm, miles, inches, cm, etc. I have to do this for volume, time, energy, power, angles etc. The only idea i have is that i need to create separate each unit into different dictionaries. I have to use if statements and while loops to make the user input more number. Please somebody help me. Im new to python. Im looking for a guide to where i should start.

I've read through your comments and imo, you are *generalizing* way too much. You're saying things like "what if this" and "what if that" is what makes me think so. I don't know your level of expertise, but IMO, one of the traps that a lot of beginning programmers fall into is feeling the need to handle every single usage case and unneedingly complicating code to deal with it, instead of saying *a priori*: "this is how the code will be used, it will expect 3 values and raise an error otherwise." Functionally there is no real difference between all the things you are saying, be it def foo(first, second third): ... Or def foo(args): first, second, third = args Or so forth. It just depends entirely on how you expect the function to be used, and don't worry about all the ways that it could go wrong. Remember that you're the programmer, so you're the one that controls the code. So what if it's user input and they enter more than 3 values? Or less than two? You're the one who has defined the function, and you're the one that gets to define how the function will be used. In the case of user input, you ought to be validating and sanitizing the input anyway, so you can right a validation function, or a function to transform the inputs into the format the function expects, etc. You are god and you get the final say.

Don't worry. Using only functions, as pure as possible, can make your programs very easy to reason about.
I think you are still confusing the aims of this project with benchmarks such as “The Computer Language Benchmarks Game.” If you still can’t understand the point I’m trying to make -which seems to be the case as evidenced by your absurd bash example- I can’t see any need to explain myself once again.

&gt; So I find this more correct, personally: &gt; &gt;&gt; This uses hiredis to parse redis requests and it's written in C. No one doubts that Python can be snappy when a chunk of the heavily lifting is done in C. Surely that can be said (or perhaps a little clarification about the use of C modules in the project homepage is a good idea) but I really can’t understand why people portray the situation in such a negative light. Would you also object to using numpy, ujson etc and claim that it’s not pure Python? Maybe people expect a very binary approach to benchmarking –either *pure* Python or C– but I’m saying that (1) it’s perfectly reasonable to benchmark Python with C extensions with C (2) also because the benefits are tangible as evidenced by numerous ubiquitous projects such as those I’ve mentioned.

Reddit uses a funky version of Markdown that doesn't support triple backtick blocks. The only way of formatting is prepending each line by 4 spaces. I'd recommend using [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/) under your GitHub account so at least you can track the code.

Working on a uni group project where we must implement a bicycle hire website. Using python and flask to do it!
pyxfreeze or nuitka are nice too
Realistically I can't commit to 1 hour a day for 100 days. It's just not going to happen. Good idea though.

I think they're referring to this subreddit's server at https://discord.gg/python 
This is one of the reasons golang is appealing, you can cross compile to static binaries/executables with a single command. Small in comparison since golang is compiled to start with. I program predominately in Python.
Thanks
Then you should probably start by profiling your code and rewriting the bottlenecks in a faster language, or at least using faster tools (PyPy, NumPy, Cython, Nuitka, etc.).
Did you even read my post?
It’s quicker to read [the docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) (which are well-written and explain everything there is) than to watch this series (which has a bunch of issues with it).
For building things that you want to give to other People , any compiled language is better than python. But sometimes, you just need those sweet python libraries 
I am literally working my way through your YouTube Data API series as we speak- what a coinkeydink! Love your work, keep it up!
If it works why move?
steadfastnnaji@yahoo.com
yes, and /u/mudclub and the bot are correct. "Experience with [common libraries]" are the same kind of question as "How do I do" questions. 
I'm asking for opinions?
Yup. Did you even read the sidebar?
Great talk by Raymond Hettinger out there on the topic. 
Not just work. In production, we need optimize service faster, reduce resource usage,...

I have, on both subs and your point is? I'm asking for an opinion on these libraries not help. 
It would be really nice if Github had an indicator of that. I almost always ask the maintainer to approve the feature/idea I want to implement in a PR unless it's trivial.
Hey, it would be great if you let me know all the issues so that I can fix them if possible. :)
As per your title, you're asking for help, on the subject of what you call a simple game for a class project. There's an implied question of 'am I alone with compatibility, and if not how did you fix it?' when dealing with two fairly popular libraries. If all you wanted was a poll of yes' and no's, then you'd just be only wanting an opinion, but that isn't helpful to anyone, so you're actually looking for more of a help and problem solving focused response. But ignoring that, the whole point of these comments is because /r/learnpython has a better community when it comes to help with projects like these. Yes, I'd wager your questions doesn't belong here. But the point is that your question will probably go further and help you develop more as a programmer on /r/learnpython. It's the forum equivalent of "I don't know the answer, but I know a guy, try asking him" 
This. I used to run away from class based projects. One day I decided enough is enough. Life got easier since that day.
I love your use of specific, constructive feedback to help a content creator improve their work. 
I love you both

We mostly use NamedTuple for organizing data
People won't just create you a complex program for free. Teach yourself, or pay someone to do it for you
Definitely interested in this. 
If you are reimplementing for performance, why python?
Thanks. Is there any benchmark to see how much bottlenecks hinder the overall computing time ?
Doing OOP the right way is very, very hard. If you've mastered it, great. I find that using functional patterns works better in my projects. It makes dealing with state easier and more transparent. Of course, Python is a great language because it gives you the freedom to use whatever paradigm you want.
Could you be more specific ?
It's called profiling. You see how much time each part of your program takes and how it all adds up
Yes
I recommend this course alongside Fred Baptiste's 3 part python course called Python 3: Deep Dive. Yeah its annoying paying $12 3 times but he covers so much stuff that colte steele doesn't cover and he also offers quite a different approach to OOP.
I can see your standpoint but I don't agree. A new programmer wont learn about architecture and low level mechanics until the basics (vars, loops, functions) are well understood. I don't see how learning the basics in Python is any different from C. My view might be biased as I've been learning to program without any official education but from my point of view the bottom up path seems like a very old one to me.
A pain in the ass. How, where would I learn to automate, each month I have 7 credit cards I have to log into the site navigate to the sections, and download my bill. Takes a while to do this. How would I scrape those sites, get my balance, and post it to some cool home GUI I could go to. Like a dashboard of my cc bills. That would help me a lot.
Basically I have acces to distant servers at work (multiple cores, hundreds of ram Gs). I use it for data manipulation, ML calibration and Monte-carlo simulations. I usually run code overnight for experimentation, more for definitive models. The data manipulation is not parallelized yet. The ML / Monte-carlo parts are. The code hasn't really been benchmarked. I want to be able to experiment at home on a similar scale (near instant data manipulation on small public data sets - Millions of rows, thousands of columns - and overnight ML calibration / Monte-carlo simulations). As I understand it, I have no I/O bound, mostly cores and ram. I am no looking in GPU acceleration (maybe I need it, but as I don't have access to it at work, this would make no sense), same answer for ECC Ram.
Yes, farming does hurt and ruin our moods! In fact I don't agree with the game mode that forces players to repeat themselves endlessly, that's terrible.
I need near instant data manipulation (on million of rows / thousands of columns) and ML calibration over said data in days / weeks. 
Pypy is a JIT compiled version of python - there may be some trouble getting it installed with numpy - but you make a big jump in speed. &amp;#x200B; Seconly if RAM is your issue and not speed you should think of using generator expressions rather than lists as it only calculates what it needs when it needs it - you'll cut down on ram. ([https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#generators](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#generators)) &amp;#x200B; To be really specific you should read the general programming books "clean code" (small book) "code complete" (big book). &amp;#x200B; Another good video you might be interested in is this [https://youtu.be/e08kOj2kISU](https://youtu.be/e08kOj2kISU).
Really cool service 
mmmh I am looking into a cloud solution, but cannot find a simple solution to start running python... nor a good way to estimate what it will cost me on the long run. 
I have access to multiple core and hundreds of GB at work. I know i won't do that on a laptop (that's why i am here). 
It's not out of the question either, but as i plan do experiment regurlarly, i am not sure it will be worth it in the long run (like renting a car versus buying a car). 
Let me know how it goes! I'm the author of Mutmut and always looking to make the first use better. 
mmh okay 
Wow this is so f\*\*king cool. Thanks for sharing and creating mutmut /u/kankyo!
Pretty sure poetry is in stealth-mode for the v1.0 release, probably mulling over breaking changes
Honestly, this should just be pinned for like 1 week.
&gt;python Nuitka is awesome!
If you are on python 3.7 you can install the 4.3.0rc1 which fixes the async keyword issue (and many other bugs since 4.2)
PM’d
What's the worst if you have to install them again?
hmmm. That makes good sense.

It would be nice if GitHub had lots of things - unfortunately they're horrendously slow to implement necessary features.
Quite. An apt demonstration of why PR activity is a shit measure of how "in the weeds" a project it.
How about a simple coin flip app? Depends on what said friend likes.

The benchmark between asyncio and the other methods is unfair. The other implementations will run each `io_bound` concurrently, but the requests within thread/process will run sequentially. The asyncio implementation will not only run each `io_bound` concurrently, but also the requests within it. A more accurate comparison would be this asyncio code: async with aiohttp.ClientSession(loop=loop) as session: for url in urls: await download_coroutine(session, url) 
Golang binaries are also huge.

Did you do it?
I bought the course for 11 $
You really should make a GUI if you have enough time, but I have some quick hacks. Afaik files drag and dropped on executables on linux are passed as arguments. This way you can pass one or more files. For different modes you can use scripts which open the main script with different arguments But all in all it will take you the same amount of time to create some simple dirty GUI.
This slack is for beginners willing to commit an hour of work at least learning python every day. After we finish Colt Steel course, we will start working on data structure and algorithms using python. Finally, we will start doing ML/AI use many of the packages offered through python.

Interesting, that can be our second course after we finish Colt Steel. Thanks so much for the advice. I really appreciate it
It is worth trying.
Great tip on the drag-and-drop, if I remember correctly it works similarly with windows command prompt. Have you used any GUI frameworks for Python that you recommend? I've been looking into those two above, both have good documentation. And if i really have time I'd like to learn to build from a basic one so not the Gooey wrapper route although still very promising project.
Then you might like data classes. They're more like organized collections of related data than something you'd use in OOP.
This is often a good option. At my work we have these two guys who are crazy about data classes or data access objects. I enjoy it 
Since CLI’s can be fairly standardized, there’s at least [one project ](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey) that generates a GUI from a CLI.
Kivy. Unlike most 90ies style GUIs, kivy is easy to style,(big buttons, bright colors). However takes some time to get used to the markup language.

It kind of depends of what you plan to feed it, and how many distinct objects you want to detect. See here for an example of [detecting cats and dogs](https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=1).
Thank you! That a fair point, I will change the post
Can swing the other direction as well. Forcing classes into a design can just end up with s ton of unnecessary structural code with logic and operations scattered across a dozen different places. OOP has a time and place, but it's definitely not a hard requirement for every design.
Ok let me resolve the issues you mentioned. 1. I will upload a set of notebooks for each video on github so that anyone can play around with the examples. 2. I acknowledge the fact that I missed to mention the fact that default value of fields is used by all objects. Let me know of there are any more such concepts that I missed (if you have time, ofc). That would be a great help. I will add these things in the notebook for reference. 3.In part 4, I was having a hard time to put a good example and while I selected the example of is_senior, I ignored the logic to reset is_senior if age was changed. Maybe I should have used a better example there. Still I hope implementation wise, the concept of post_init is clear there. Special thanks for pointing out this issue. :)
