Trying to download their Anaconda program right now. I spent 8 hours trying to download it yesterday, about 1 and a half today (including the short ish download times)
Spydet and pycharm hold your hand a little much... REAL Data Analysts use Scratch
I’ve been trying to get it to work as well as getting Spyder to work and decided to just go with PyCharm
I don't understand but OK.
That’s weird. It works with no setup required other than installing anaconda and use spyder for ide. What issues were you facing?
Sorry, that was a bad joke. [Scratch](scratch.mit.edu) is a graphical programming language often used by students who are completely new to programming. It is nice for making, neat little art projects, but has next to no production value, beyond educating the would-be coder. Spyder is a wonderful choice, and a great tool within the Anaconda tool-set.
You need to package your lambda for AWS if you use venv / pip and install non-standard packages. Follow the AWS docs for packaging a zip file and use the "file upload" in the lambda interface instead of inline code. If aiohttp has some of level dependencies you need to build binaries using an Amazon AMI and include those in the package.
nim! nim! nim! So awesome. I think this would be a great companion language to have in you tool box.
it works! yeah just click launch on spider, in the anaconda navigator. that didn’t work?
I am interested in this class. Is it worth it to pay the 75$ for the exams and certificate or should I just do the free version?
linux
Go talk to your professor
yea that's exactly what a stupid person would do
This should be tagged as an add.
Free. Most employers and colleges don't care for online course certificates
I'd personally do the free version under the logic if you like the course and are going to use it in your career then you are likely to take the courses after it that cover more specific skills and getting a cert in those kind of proves you already know the foundations.
How would i know that i am experiencing friction due to the limitations of the editor and not because of my incompetence?
Thank you so much !! Means a lot.
Nim doesn't seem Python-like at all besides the whitespace indenting.
In this case it is assumed every input file(s) are an unknown line count and unknown min or max line length per line. The file size I'm referring to would be the max portion of a file I could load into memory for editing or inspection. For example, maybe I have two .txt word lists that are 10gb each and I wanna remove any duplicates from both and or themselves. Probably safe to assume that would fill most users memory to attempt to load 20gb total at once. So instead I would wanna chop it up to say 200 temp files in 100mb chunks. The problem I'm having is deciding if its better/faster to cut these files up by line count (which results in variable file size but I assume faster) or as size portions of the original files (assumed to be more manageable but slower to process). Sorry if I'm not explaining very well! I'm doing the best I can to keep it simple lol.
How much algebra do you need to know for data science goodness? I was thinking of trying to get into python and data science but I am pretty sad at algebra. I am decent at coding, been working on full stack web development for over a year.

I don't see any advantages over something like Go (already available in stable releases, backed, sort of, by Google, great stdlib, etc.).
Free. In software at the ground level no one really cares about certs. A rule of thumb for me is to be leery of certs that don't have a practical portion. For example LFCSA (Linux Foundation Certified SysAdmin) and RHCSA (Red Hat Certified System Administrator) are well regarded for sysadmin work partly because they give you a list of tasks to accomplish and you don't know exactly what they'll ask. Though MCSE was kind of the exception to that rule. Free -- Now that is unless you need a certificate for benefits or continuing education at work. Then it would make sense to get the certificate.
I’m doing this and was wondering if I get it wrong on the regular exercises do you guys change your answer till it’s right? I have been but it feels like cheating if it is suppose to be “graded”.

Would you also recommend the course for someone who is already familiar with Python? I started learning Python a few months ago and already had acquired knowledge of other programming languages. Would you say there are still benefits for me in taking this course? (e.g. the "Computer Science" part)
Data science can involve all sorts of math, but most of it is not beyond the possibilities of self-teaching. In fact, teaching yourself a subject when you need to know it for a project is far more effective thank taking a class. Just start the data science project and go until you can’t, then figure out why you can’t and solve that problem. Repeat ad nauseum.
I joined, new to code jam. Anyone can explain how this works? or link me it?

If tou wanna learn math i'd recomend you [https://www.khanacademy.org/math](https://www.khanacademy.org/math) It's totaly free and teach you from adding two integers to integrals, vectors and so on.
If I want to do something that is considered by colleges and employers, what else would you recommend ?
I think first you should finish 90% of course. After that you can think about paying. Because once I paid for some course in edX and it was too tough for me that time and I ended up dropping that Course and losing that money.

So, I see people going on about this all over reddit, and I know there's no point to actually explaining it, but what the hell. I'll explain it. The monitor is a big deal; if it has the capabilities they're claiming for it, it competes with reference monitors that cost tens of thousands of dollars, and Apple's going to sell theirs starting at $5k. That's going to change the market for creative professionals who need a monitor with the kind of precision-calibrated color Apple is claiming they'll provide. So, what about the stand? Well, a lot of the people who'd want the monitor already have a stand or mount and won't want another one. They're going to give Apple an extra $199 and get a thing that attaches to the back of the monitor to provide a standard four-screw VESA attachment to their existing stand or mount. But *some* people will want a stand, and they'll want it to be high quality. So Apple has to do small production run (expensive) of a high-quality item (expensive). Which means the stand is expensive. It *is* probably still overpriced, but I suspect the goal there is to encourage people to just go with the VESA mount.
https://www.archlinux.org/news/python-is-now-python-3/ Wow. It was 9 years ago. While people are still fricking out about Python 2 Arch wiped the slate clean almost a decade ago and everything was and is working just fine. God, I love Arch.
Thank you so much
&gt; We have to upgrade to Django 1.11.5 before upgrading to Python 3.7. Hopefully you mean Django 1.11.17, since that's the one that fixed Python 3.7 compatibility (initially, the Django 1.11 didn't plan to support Python 3.7 at all). Also, that was a weird one. [This is the python-dev thread](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2017-November/150481.html) that led to it.
It has generic and macro /s
I think you should add a disclaimer to your messages, readers should know if a feedback comes from someone affiliated with kite ;) Although it has been happening a lot in the past two weeks, kite seems to work fine today with Pycharm. I will make sure to pastebin the error trace should it happen again. As for the doc, it seems to be better than before indeed, but I don't think you can call it "more thorough" since both pycharm and kite fetch the same sources (at least on numpy &amp; sklearn quick tests, pandas' is still more complete on pycharm side, with neat features such as jump to source, link to official doc, and resizing) &amp;#x200B; Anyway, I'll keep kite around because I do want to believe in it, but it is not an inconditional love.
It's amazing that -- looking at the Issue for PyHive -- this took \*over a year\* for them to resolve in a release. What the absolute FLIP?

1. /r/learnpython? 2. In what context?
What a shit domain, no chance you'll get even your $1 back for it, not to mention few hundred :D
eg-tons of stuff =A lot of stuff
i would suggest starting with django and eventually move over to flask
Miguel Grinberg (the guy behind the Flask mega tutorial) have also started a MicroPython tutorial series recently, which might be of interest. https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/introducing-my-micropython-tutorial
Django is battery included while flask is not, am I right ?
Start here: [https://realpython.com/oop-in-python-vs-java/](https://realpython.com/oop-in-python-vs-java/)
It's a unit of weight. 1 metric ton/tonne. What's this got to do with Python?
I would recommend the book: Fluent Python, and then after you know more than basic scripting in Python, you could dig into Flask/Django
Is the dictionary as a switch replacement faster than the "if elif elif else" block?
where to start: official python tut: [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) Django is a bit much: you can start with Flask difference in thinking: nope (just less boilerplate)

In the first test, under the heading "Timing Tests", `math.pow()` is slightly slower than `**` with exponent 2. In the second test, under the heading "Charting the Performance", `math.pow()` is about twice as fast than `**` when using exponent 2. Why the discrepancy?
Pycharm is just a development environment for Python.
Gross...go? Seriously...Google makes awful products..they just slam anything out and hope people use it. Google is worse than Microsoft.

Seems like a good idea.
I helped one of our projects save approx. 20 thousand dollars by writing a script that linearly extrapolates to match certain data points.

I hate to be *that* guy, but you’re a lawyer who writes and spells like a 10 year-old.
Go isn't a systems language like C/C++/rust?
The recursion limit is only "automatic" for actual Python code, builtins [don't necessarily implement it properly and might just segfault when they run out of C stack](https://bugs.python.org/issue14010).
The recursion limit only tracks Python functions in CPython, not builtin functions. As this runs, you’ll be generating a massive chain of nested `filter()` objects. The Python functions themselves just do the modulus, no recursion. So from Python’s perspective, it’s recursing to a maximum of 3 levels (toplevel, `sieve()`, the inner lambda). However there still is recursion on the C level calling `filter`’s `__next__` implementation. If you let it run enough you’ll blow the C stack, and the process will be killed. You might get something different on another Python implementation, this is just a consequence of how CPython is written.
Yes, my child. Come to the dark side.
Thank you very much, this was really bugging me.
Thanks for the response, very informative.
A portfolio. Start some projects and get them up on GitHub. Be prepared to talk about problems you faced and how you overcame them, why you made certain decisions (for example used one data structure over another, used one algorithm over another, etc). Include unit tests. Contribute to open source. Fork a repo and hack at it. Add new features or fix some bugs. Make a PR. Show that you can use git for more than just storing code. These days employees seem more interested in what you're able to do. Anyone can pass a class with a little effort. And what you learn in a class is a drop in the ocean compared to what you learn through actually creating projects and solving real problems. Just my two cents.
I took this course a while ago. It's not a python course. It's a computer science ourse that uses python.
Thank you bro. I think that what you said is so much true.
i can't understand when i read this content while i learn python: "Universal imports may look great on the surface, but they’re not a good idea for one very important reason: they fill your program with a *ton* of variable and function names without the safety of those names still being associated with the module(s) they came from. " what exact meaning of it is?
"A ton" means "many". The meaning is that when you use `from foo import *`, you import many things from `foo` that you do not need.
is it correct for my above problem ?
yes
It was designed as a systems language, although it's mostly used for networking and distributed systems now.
It's whatever python is in your path If you have both 2 and 3 in path, first one wins. If you have multiple you need the confusing py launcher to be certain or use a full path
 [https://www.pythonanywhere.com](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/bratpit24/) Is very good python web app. I'm pretty sure it will allow you for a daily script for free and you need to pay for more. It also uses PIP for any libraries you need so no worries about dependencies. Not sure if it works on mobile, never tried it, but can't see why it wouldn't. Another solution would be to leave your computer in sleep mode, and have bat file wake it up, run the script and sleep it again.
Haskell functions don't use the C stack conventionally, if you write a recursive function that doesn't get TCOd you'll be limited by whenever you run out of heap space (or not if it just gets swapped)
thank you i get it
thank !!
Hmm I guess it's just that I don't want to sound facetious, but have you looked into just reading the files per data chunk? piece_size = 4096 # that's 4kb with open("file", "rb") as handle: piece = handle.read(piece_size) You can also use enumerate if you don't want to load them all up in memory : with open("file", "r") as handle: for i, line in enumerate(handle): Hope that helps!
This course is the business
Why do we have an option of "Do you agree to be matched with people you may not know, regardless of your team preference? \*" and the only available answer is "yes" ?

Hey, Fellow Java developer here (backend, +10 years), now doing mostly Python, with some JS/ES6 and TypeScript. The links here are really good for a start. Flask, Django are good. There's also Connexion (my favourite, simple and based on Flask, reminds a little SpringBoot for being opinionated and having DI), Tornado and aiohttp. The [project](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/) I am working on is a cyclic workflows scheduler (similar to Apache Airflow, but instead of a DAG, it has DCG's). We are using JupyterHub, and using Tornado. You will have to part away from a few things in Java (I've been working on this project for ~9months so far): - The concurrency paradigm is different. You may have read about the GIL, ways around it (e.g. spaCy NLP lib circumvents it with some low level code). But once you start working on a project with one or more "main loops", and executing coroutines, subprocesses (my project uses coroutines, a pool of subprocesses and I believe there is some threading with PyZMQ), you realize it's completely different from concurrency in Java. It may take you some time to stop thinking in Threads - Some patterns common to Java developers are not common in Python, or may be hard to implement. Singleton, Dependency Injection, are some that you may find, though slightly different than how you would implement in Java. But Builders and Factories are not that common (or sometimes implemented in quite different ways). - Some names will be different for you, like traceback instead of stack trace - It will be way easier for you to try your code. Especially if you familiarize yourself with Notebooks (there's Apache Zeppelin that is written in Java and runs Java too, but not that popular). - Build tools and packaging are very different. Nothing like Maven/Gradle artefacts. No central repository. You have PYPI, but some dependencies are installed via GitHub URL's too (though we also have that in Java, just not so common in large projects I guess). And instead of that isolation you had in Java, with projects sharing artefacts versions, and having multiple versions in your local Maven repo, you will probably want to invest some time learning how to use virtual environments (with virtualenv, with python 3.+ venv, or conda). This is a life saver - Just like we have Maven/Gradle/Ivy/whatnot, there are multiple tools for building/packaging your project. I am using Setuptools and pip, planning to upload another project to Conda soon. Spend some time reading [about packaging](https://packaging.python.org/) in Python. I think it's quite easy for a Java developer used with Maven to understand it. - Watch out that even with PEP 484, you don't have runtime type checking (I mean, not natively). - The equivalent for our code in the JDK SDK, is the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/). Spend some time getting familiar with that too. - There is no project like Guava or Commons Lang as widely used as in Java. Though the language provides lots of useful things, and there are multiple libraries offering useful addendum to the language - A good IDE may help you to familiarize with Python 3. Don't bother with Python 3, start with Python 3. My project is using Python 3.7. For Java I use Eclipse (been using it since version... 2.1 I think?), but for Python I switched from Eclipse PyDev to PyCharm. Their code inspection tool helped me a lot with common mistakes (a semi-colon here or there, forgetting to indent, even supports type hinting and is able to inspect the code and try to guess whether you used the right type or not). Hope that helps! Welcome to the team!
If you're burned out, recover. If you don't want to learn, don't. Forcing yourself to learn Python will ensure you never will. If it's something you truly want, work on something that interests you. Grab pygame and fail at making a snake clone. Try using the requests libraries to work on entry level hacking CTFs. Create a MLP fan page and automate cert renewel. If you aren't having fun, you'll never learn it, or want to do it.
I’m in the process of teaching myself calculus and physics on that
This.
If you hate it so much then don't be that guy.
That's implementation dependent though, a specific implementation might use the C stack (IIRC Hugs does / did).
Sure, I've edited to clarify that I'm talking about ghc
Nim is very different from Go, in some ways its opposite: * Go is a minimalist. Nim is maximalist. Go [dumbs everything down](https://github.com/ksimka/go-is-not-good) to make programmers cheap to replace. Nim has useful features from languages like C++, Ada, Lisp, Haskell, etc. This gives intelligent programmers more power to write better and safer code. * Being an advertising campaign for Big Brother is [**NOT**](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmingcirclejerk/comments/brn107/go_is_googles_language_not_the_communitys/eoh7h6d/) a universally loved attribute of Go. To a growing number of people, Google is enemy #1. Nim is a grass-roots programming language for [those who prefer freedom](https://voat.co/v/programming/2853775). It has [sponsors](https://nim-lang.org/sponsors.html) specializing in blockchain and game development. * The size of Go's executable binaries is insane, with major programs easily passing 100MB. [Nim binaries](https://github.com/dom96/binary_size), on the other hand, are nearly indistinguishable from those written in C/C++. * Go reinvents the wheel by having its own backend. That backend is optimized for compilation time, but produces relatively slow code. Nim gives you a choice of backends (ex. clang, gcc, [Intel C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_C%2B%2B_Compiler) for fastest code, [tcc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_C_Compiler) for compilation speed, [pcc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_C_Compiler) for [copyfree](http://copyfree.org)dom, etc). With clang or gcc Nim beats Go (and gogcc) in performance benchmarks (ex. [kostya](https://github.com/kostya/benchmarks)). Because they're married to LLVM and can't use the fastest proprietary compiler for a particular platform, Nim can also outperform languages like Swift, Crystal, Dlang (LDC), and even Rust. * Nim's module ecosystem is [growing very quickly](https://www.reddit.com/r/nim/comments/9rf1ob/happy_800_modules_nimbles_ytd_growth_beats_d_c/). All the best libraries are in C/C++, and Nim makes it very easy to write wrappers.
I guess that once you know that you know you should be able to do something easily and can see why you should, but a peculiarity of the editor doesn’t allow it, then there you go. For example, I’m learning about Common Lisp. I wanted to load my Lisp file easily into the Lisp REPL (like Python’s IDLE). I didn’t see a ready made build for Lisp in vsCode’s extensions. The book I’m working through recommends the SLIME editor which looks like Emacs with some Lisp specific bindings. Long a vim user, I began to wonder about it. I plan on getting it installed today because I want a little less friction and more learning about Lisp. In this case, my editor wasn’t making it easier for me, and an alternative exists. I can see the build and run steps in my head, and I want to do those things in a couple of keyboard shortcuts. I could probably write a build job for Code, or I can just get this other editor. I am very new in my Lisp journey, but I don’t think it’s due to incompetence that I felt this friction: the Lisp community has a long history with Emacs.
It's not about the quality of their products. It's about Google being a de facto branch of the NSA, centralizing power over you and giving this information to the government. And they (shadow)censor non-leftist political opinion.

As someone that has asked (stupid) questions in the past and will probably do that in the future a whole lot of "help" posts rile me up. Help posts should be removed when they: 1. Are easily google-able. 2. Not properly explained. Like no description of the actual error, what is expected, what the person tried, etc. 3. Basically just say "Do my work for me." But certain "help" posts are relevant or worthy of discussion i think. People here get mad at the help questions and i do understand it, as i said, i get riled up too for the reasons i mentioned earlier. Add to that the "Hi, i want to build &lt;crazily ambitious project&gt; is python right for me?" and other questions that are pointless and get posted very often. On the other side though, you can easily skip such posts and i understand it a little bit if a 'newbie' asks an innocent question and gets greeted by having his post removed and pointed to another subreddit. "If 30% of the posts are help posts, that means i have 30% less news!!!" is stupid. Help posts here are rarely upvoted. They don't clog the subreddit and they won't ever show up if you click on top of the week, months, etc. posts. You could spam the URL to /r/learnpython all over the place in bold bright letters and people will still post questions. Maybe a bot that can check if it's someones first question or not could help? "This is your first post here so we will let it stand but in the future please ask such kind of questions in learnpython." If someone asks questions over and over on this sub it's not good. I guess i don't have a point... just written down my thoughts. &amp;#x200B; People that post meme pictures of python or the 10000th youtube channel to "learn the basics" are worse in my opinion. Whatever.
Recommended reading: [Nim for Python Programmers](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/wiki/Nim-for-Python-Programmers). Nim is closer to Python than any other [system programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_programming_language). Not just [OSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-side_rule) but also ``import``, exceptions, brevity (compare to Rust), "batteries included", etc. In some ways it's even briefer than Python, thanks to optional parenthesis, [UFCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Function_Call_Syntax), a better approach to OOP, etc. Obviously it can't be exactly Python because it has type safety and ten tons of additional features.
I will pm about SQL , i have a friend whom is senior developer and he works with web apps . So he kinda consulted me to go that way i am still learning so it dont know .
I totally understand that , my post is out of format with everything. But please keep in mind that i speak my native (Bosnia) , german , and english would be my 3rd language. Its mostly due to rap/hip hop influence and i often writh in "slang manner". I am sorry bro. I didnt have much of time to put it together well...
Its far away from that that i dont want to , its actually pretty fun. But i dont have 6-8-10 hours to put into it. And eventually i would have to skip some days due to real life obligations...
&gt; Does Tkinter play nice with pickle? Probably not. I'm not going to bother to check, because DON'T USE PICKLE. Pickle has its place, but it's slow, it carries risks about code execution, and it can potentially version-lock your pickled files. For storing data at rest: 1) Python's JSON library is faster and simpler 2) You should store _actual model_ data, e.g. the integers, not the IntVars, which are objects which exist to link your model with your UI. Ideally, you'd represent the character sheet data as an object or dict, and JSON (or Pickle, if you _must_) that. It contains no UI-related objects like IntVars, just raw data.
Thank you i will def. consider that. I just feel like i will get rusty with things i already learned due to fact i am making progress but in pretty slow manner.
Hey thank you both of you. I actually had an idea in my head , and i have read a similar comment here once i got into my very first lessions. But i just feel like i should just give it a go to learn a language and by getting into my own projects i bet i will understand more. &amp;#x200B; Thank you once again .
wow, that's some very useful information. I'll have a look at the project you mentioned in the weekend. For the editor, I left Eclipse many years ago, I'm in the Intellij platforms now :) I will also try Connexion, just to have something to compare. &amp;#x200B; I'm more someone who likes to get hands dirty so perhaps I will try to build something simple, with Flask or connexion ( my understanding is that they're the simplest to start with ) &amp;#x200B; Did you find it hard to find jobs as Python developer with no experience but with only Java experience ?
It'll probably be the same in Java and C# too since they also use heap for storing objects, right?
https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/issues/essentials-games-vol1/ You can download for free or buy it in print. Takes you through the fundamentals of pygame from drawing to physics. Every section has an example for you to type and learn plus makes good for good asset code.
I did this course after the University of Michigan Python for Everyone course on Coursera and I still think I learned a lot from the MIT one. In fact I’d say it’s where I felt like I really “learned” Python.
An alternative would be to setup a Raspberry Pi server at your place. It will consume much less than your computer.
&gt;I'm more someone who likes to get hands dirty so perhaps I will try to build something simple, with Flask or connexion ( my understanding is that they're the simplest to start with ) A colleague uses connexion to provide a web service layer on top of some machine learning and semantic web: https://github.com/natlibfi/annif There is a built-in small UI, that in part uses Vue.js. I know one of the pending issues in the project is creating an admin interface. Just in case you are looking for a project to implement something that will be used by others (plus the developers there are really nice). &gt;Did you find it hard to find jobs as Python developer with no experience but with only Java experience ? I think it may depend on where you are, and your background. Even though I developed mostly in Java, I had some Python modules in PYPI, some contribution to open source projects, and had done other similar projects/modules in PHP, R, and JavaScript (whatever is needed for the job). I think the previous open source contributions were important for me getting the current position. And my employer wasn't interested in applying those programming tests. It was more a chat, going over my previous projects, asking if he could see some of that (for some I had links to GitHub projects, or could point to some product online and say which part I worked). He expected me to have at least basic Python 2 knowledge (part of the work was migrating the tool to Python 3), but was OK with my forte being Java. Even said it could be something good to add to the project, the views/experience with different language/projects. So I think it really depends on company culture/project/employer/etc. But if you build some sort of portfolio like a good GitHub profile, that should probably help. Cheers
It's mostly to do with that the execution context is stored on the heap, you can do the same in python by using coroutines. (My example is using asyncio only for it's event loop) import asyncio async def fib(n: int): if n &lt; 2: return n return (await asyncio.create_task(fib(n - 1)) + await asyncio.create_task(fib(n - 2))) asyncio.run(fib(100000)) By creating a 'task' the function doesn't descend into it's own stack frame, instead a new execution context is created.
They aren't the devil but in my personal experience they are £10k-£30k low on their salaries in the UK
Can you post your code that you’re trying to run? It’s more likely something wrong with your code.
Your code is unnecessarily complicated. If you just want a list of the primes to *n*, this simple function works fine; it handles 2 as a special case, sieving only over odd numbers, and starts striking multiples only from the square of the prime: def primes(n): # sieve of eratosthenes i, p, ps, m = 0, 3, [2], n // 2 sieve = [True] * m while p &lt;= n: if sieve[i]: ps.append(p) for j in range((p*p-3)/2, m, p): sieve[j] = False i, p = i+1, p+2 return ps You may prefer a generator that returns the primes one by one: def primegen(start=0): # stackoverflow.com/a/20660551 if start &lt;= 2: yield 2 # prime (!) the pump if start &lt;= 3: yield 3 # prime (!) the pump ps = primegen() # sieving primes p = next(ps) and next(ps) # first sieving prime q = p * p; D = {} # initialization def add(m, s): # insert multiple/stride while m in D: m += s # find unused multiple D[m] = s # save multiple/stride while q &lt;= start: # initialize multiples x = (start // p) * p # first multiple of p if x &lt; start: x += p # must be &gt;= start if x % 2 == 0: x += p # ... and must be odd add(x, p+p) # insert in sieve p = next(ps) # next sieving prime q = p * p # ... and its square c = max(start-2, 3) # first prime candidate if c % 2 == 0: c += 1 # candidate must be odd while True: # infinite list c += 2 # next odd candidate if c in D: # c is composite s = D.pop(c) # fetch stride add(c+s, s) # add next multiple elif c &lt; q: yield c # c is prime; yield it else: # (c == q) # add p to sieve add(c+p+p, p+p) # insert in sieve p = next(ps) # next sieving prime q = p * p # ... and its square
Alright, thats what I'm looking for, learning more about Computer Science! Thanks.
Also remember to post to r/learnpython for specific help questions, next time!
Also remember to post to r/learnpython for specific help questions, next time!
thank you. you just gave me something to do in coming days :) Cheers
The IDEs that give you problem are most likely interpreting the undesired version of python or vice versa. Post your code and the output.
You called the GPL a commie license. Hard to trust your opinion after that.
Okay thanks, is the JSON one a standard lib? That's what attracted me to pickle. Yeah that makese sense , I should split the code up a bit more
A raspberry pi is a really good solution. I run a few twitter bots and a reddit bot from them, and am probably going to get a few more pi's and run some home automation tasks from them. The best argument for a pi in my opinion is the wealth of resources helping you get it running. They have a limit to their computational power, but a lot of programs are well within that limit.
1. /r/learnpython 2. You want a dictionary.
As others have said, it's hard to help without seeing your code. However here are some suggestions (for VS Code): * Reindent the file (it should say "Spaces" or "Tabs" in the bottom right, click that and select "Indent using Spaces" and pick a number) * Reformat the file (right-click and select "Format Document" * Lint the file (Click View -&gt; Command Palette and type "lint" to see options, you can select a linter, e.g. pylint, which will help you identify the issue) note that you may need to install a linter * If VS Code shows where the error is occurring, look at the preceding code as that may be where the real issue is (e.g. preceding line is an "if" statement but has no colon at the end) * The file may have some odd character, you can try re-encoding it by selecting the encoding (look at the bottom right of vscode, beside the indentation setting)
REAL Data Analysts depend much more on R
That's fine. You don't need 6 hours everyday. You can do an hour a few times a week when you have the time/energy for it. Anything is better than nothing.
i tried doing that slice but apprarntly there isnt a slice method in the dataframe?
 dataFft\_ = dataFft\[:len(dataFft)/2\] TypeError: slice indices must be integers or None or have an \_\_index\_\_ method
I would have never thought it would come the day where I could see fortran written in python.
Don't post solutions to the qualifier!
/r/learnpython
It is. import json. It has methods to load and dump to files.
Sorry but I shall be dead before I fully get that...
We can't guarantee that you'll be matched with your team preference, so that question's there to make sure you understand this. In the past, jam teams have consisted of 2-3 members, and yes you can put down multiple preferences.

Hello everyone. The blog has moved to my custom domain. [https://www.pylenin.com/blogs/python-logging-guide/](https://www.pylenin.com/blogs/python-logging-guide/)
First let me say that I feel like I am at least partially responsible for this topic resurfacing. I recently had a post removed, and was, to say the least, most displeased about it. As a result, a rather vitriolic exchange in PMs was conducted by myself and mod/OP. First, I want to comment on the optics. Another user commenting on this thread notes the 'natural tendency' to consult /r/python when seeking help. S/he isn't wrong -- the unqualified term 'python' suggests the broadest possible subject matter, and to have your post taken down when you are making a sincere and informed plea for assistance from the community is at best 'unwelcoming'. A closer look at the quantity and quality of posts to the sub demonstrates that were all such posts effectively prevented/removed the sub would see perhaps as little as 10% of the traffic that it does now. The fact is, the real news about python is that it's userbase is growing with a remarkable rapidity. Further, OP's near one-man enforcement of the policy makes him appear as a bit of an obsessed ogre -- even though he probably isn't. I am not a college student. I have been, twice. Neither time did I graduate -- once I was hired away; once I left due to a critical illness and death in my immediate family. The last programming course I attended was sometime in 1979, and was a class in RPG/II. I am largely self taught, program in several languages, including c#, NodeJS, Java, and yes, python. I am not inexperienced in seeking help from user communities. I was an old hand at providing support to user communities before reddit even existed. Let me assure you the tendency to camp the unqualified term 'python' in the interest of providing a strict, formulaic delivery of a 'news of python' content stream is nothing but pure fail. &amp;#x200B; But seriously, such criticism is not genuinely helpful without some suggestions. 1) My favorite: form an appropriately named sub (e.g., r/newsofpython) and post your python news there. Given the seeming desire of your currently entrenched user base to see news of python type posts and only those type posts, it seems a given that they'd be delighted to sit on such a quiet sub awaiting whatever it is that gets 'lost in the noise' on this sub. Then this sub could be permitted to flourish under terms as broad as that which gives the sub it's name. 2) Stop pretending there is enough news to really require a dedicated sub in which to deliver it. AFAIK, this sub is not an official source of \*anything\* relating to python, so there is no special requirement to get one's news here; in fact, I dare say there are better places to get such news, and that anything you learn here in that regard is 'after the fact'. It's pretty simple -- just let the topics flow. 3) OP's flair suggestion. It's reaching around your ass to get to your elbow, but hey, if your arms are long....and it would, in fact, solve the problem. ....and finally 4) Initially, I did not aappreciate the volume of 'please do my homework for me' posts. I think I am coming to see that light, however. Now it seems to me that a better, more logical philosophy would be to outlaw such posts, rather than any and all requests for assistance; such a policy would be easier to enforce and easier to justify. I left this sub, some might say in a huff; there was certainly that quality about it. I do still read it however, in the interest of learning something from the stream and in the interest of following this particular topic. I'd actually love to come back, if I thought that I and others with similar concerns weren't going to be treated poorly for having the audacity to assume that 'python' actually just means 'python'. Just my 0.02$US
can you expand on why it's a nice addition in the toolbox? &amp;#x200B; What would I gain if I am already familiar with Java, Clojure/Script and Python for example? &amp;#x200B; I have kept an eye on Nim but never could justify to myself to try it
Has nobody mentioned you can increase the recursion limit with [sys.setrecursionlimit](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.setrecursionlimit) ? Generally raising that limit is not a good idea. If you need close to that level of recursion, you should consider re-implementing you code to run non-recursively. But I understand, you're experimenting with code here.
Thanks for the quick answer. Just one more thing: how do I split the team member names? Any specific delimiter (assuming that the process is automated)?
lmfao go look up how fast go is. it's faster than python and about as fast as java.
yep, not relevant to the sub at all
What is it adding to?
The speed is totally negligible and the language is completely different then most languages that came before it so you need to learn new syntax and it solves no new issue. Why didnt they spend time optimizing and or forking and pulling to am existing language. Google just wants to control everything and people just fall in line. It is dumb. They are open source vampires.
it's not negligible in a production environment and. do you know what *scaling* is?
I've thought about this for a while and I have a few new questions. I see this post as having two key elements: Adding flair to all posts, and no longer removing learning posts. With respect to the flair, assuming this takes place, what is the expected timeline on applying it to posts? I'm very in favor of flair and I think it'll help force low effort blog posts to self identify, and give a way to classify them more easily. Focusing on the learning posts. I understand and agree that removing learning posts for what is effectively python's landing page on reddit feels very unpythonic. I like the language because of how welcoming it's designed to be. Removing learners can feel like telling new programmers that they don't belong. On the other hand, I'm going to guess that for a few days, mods have generally abstained from removing most learning posts based on what I've seen move higher up in my feed lately. Maybe there's just fewer reported posts. Either way there appear to be a lot more questions. Some wouldn't be asked on the learning sub because they're more general open ended questions, but a lot are really basic questions. With this, the amount I want to engage on average with a post has dropped. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's something I've noticed in my own behavior. So I have another proposal, but it's based on my assumptions of how reddit works, so around that I have more questions. (Right away I want to suggest it to see thoughts on how it works and explore the idea rather than suggest it 'as the one and true solution'). Given that I like the flair idea separate from this problem, institute flair for posts. Have a [help] flair as well. * If a post is marked as help, do a few things automatically. Automatically remove help posts, with a message requesting the user ask the question in /r/learnpython instead. * After 24 hours the OP can reply to the automatic reply, requesting that the original removed help post be 'unremoved' . * This reply must include a link to the /r/learnpython post. the learnpython post must still be up, (not removed by a mod there), * and OP must have replied to at least one of the commenters there. (If there are no comments, or no comment there has equal to or above 0 comment karma, this condition is ignored.) If those conditions are met, the post can be allowed to be escalated to the python sub. The time delay prevents 'finish my homework' spam, and the automatic nature of it might help reduce 'mods don't like me' feelings in users. (After all, automod removing posts from new accounts isn't hated on by many). Requiring the user to reply to the auto comment about the submissions removal after 24 hours have passed forces them to come back to it and affirm that they want their post to be unremoved, that way their absence doesn't trigger spam. (they can't post and abandon thread) And if they've come to a solution in that time, the question is no longer needed and stays removed. Based on glitches on the helper bot, if a post gets removed and then is 'unremoved' by a mod, reddit puts it back to the top of new list automatically, so it'll get seen. Is this correct? If not this suggestion falls flat right there. I feel like the flair option allows for posts to distinguish themselves as discussions rather than help, allowing those posts to circumvent this process. I don't know if that trait will be heavily abused though. (It should also be noted that I want to continue working on the helper bot, as it's goal is question answering and I want to get that portion online in a way that's useful to others on this sub. I certainly am trying to keep that from biasing my opinion on this matter and I think I have, but as it's a motivation of mine it might impact my opinion none the less.)
So use java or c++ if you are so concerned. Dont need to invent a new language with a new catch phrase and cringey naming conventions.
Checked this out further. It has \- **online hosted documentation** \- **docs as chrome app** \- **I can even get a locally hosted version from github.** &amp;#x200B; Seems perfect for now. Thanks!!
well, aswell as that: how do you define your python, then&gt;?
Sorry, can you rephrase that? I have no idea what you're asking right now.
I'm not concerned, *you're wrong on the internet* and you're just shitting all over this post with shit you made up about go.
You just dont like my opinion. Doesn't mean it is low quality. Idiots are always making new languages and then some morons at a company decide it is a good idea to use it and then us developers need to learn it and support it for no damn reason. If you want a simple script language use python. If some process is slow. Drop down to c++ for that process and move on with your life.
you lied about something and won't take a correction. get out of here
Code? Or a GitHub repo?
If you’re trying to call it an advertisement, it’s just ad, add is where you’re adding two things, usually numbers, together.
Did you mix indents and spaces? Are you sure everything is lined up properly?
Might want to put an /s there bud to denote the sarcasm for those who are uninformed XD
Codecademy
then go away, pal. Move on.
Huh? No I didn't. You guys just always want something new. Move on man. It was a fun side project but no one wants to use it unless you are gonna geek out..
Hello all, I spent a few weeks trying to gather as much information as possible from the current state of python packaging, as it was very confusing and I saw a lot of questions going around about it. I do not claim this post is fully correct, accurate, or unbiased, and I would definitely enjoy any feedback to add it to the post. Please feel free to write your mind here and I will include it to the post this evening. Thanks
yea pretty much. django would just give you the stuff wheras in flask you'd have to make it yourself.
That depends on your ability to learn, the resources you use, and what "learn Python" means to you.
Thats good question, I will play around those.
learn it to the point where I can apply for jobs, using mostly online resources. My learning ability I would say above average, and I'll be taking modafinil every few days for a boosted focus.
To be clear: * this post has nothing to do with you. As I said to you in my first reply, I bring up rules and concerns with the community every six months or so and I've been working towards this for a while * you messaged me telling me to create a new subreddit because this one was "visiting brutality on new users" despite the fact that the removal questions are polite, and typically help people find answers * when I explained that the rules as they are now were because of the community, you called me a predator * even in this post you insinuated that I'm an obsessed ogre just because I've been doing the things that the community has specifically requested These are only some highlights into how you have been unpleasant; more can be seen in your reply which is contradictory and are not particularly useful, and moreover suggest a lack of general understanding of reddit. With regards to your suggestion that now moderators should remove "please do my homework" style posts, I don't think adding the requirement for a qualitative assessment of a question for difficulty is actually a good idea, because my idea of what is trivially easy and yours are not the same.
I usually just use 1 tab as this is consistent and quick. It can be a great way to avoid this sort of issue... if this is what's causing it anyway
I ssh into my server, then type "screen" to create a persistent connection, so that if my local computer loses Internet or restarts, I don't lose the terminal instant (you just reconnect to it with "screen - rd"). For me, this works really well, and allows me to queue up a lot of scripts with no worry that they will stop if I turn my computer off.
If your scripts are not very resource intensive and don't take too long to complete a serverless solution like AWS lambda may do the job
I would say it depends on your existing toolbox. Adding nim to what you’ve listed won’t add much if any. I think there is probably a not insignificant portion of python users wouldn’t mind a fast, compiled language to reach for/know about if needed. Nim seems like a good companion to python to me. I’ve been doing python full time for a few years and I was really happy with how I’ve been able to dabble with nim pretty easily. I think people should be multi-lingual in terms of computer languages and if all you know is python, nim would be a good second language candidate that is not too foreign.
Thanks my friend, it’s really nice from you
Thanks bro
Extremely unlikely, nootropics or not.
man, I've been using python for almost 20 years and I still don't know it.
I&gt;iî
Thank you for your kind words mate..
Do you think the other applicants for the jobs you want will have six weeks of experience? If you have no programming experience that means after six weeks you will have less experience than someone who has taken the first half of a single computer science class. Granted, okay, you're putting in more hours than a single course demands. But do you think you will have mastered even two years of material? Do you think your competitors will have less experience than that?
If programming is a joke to your employer, sure. Please note this is not to put you down, but 6 weeks is....nothing.
Yes. It goes faster if you know another language and have someone like a coworker to correct your mistakes. It took me 2 weeks to be useful.
&gt; no programming exp You are absolutely not going to get a job with 6 weeks of self taught programming time. If you do, please let us know who the employer is so we can avoid them. Please note this is a not a comment on you, just the harsh reality of the job market. There are infinitely better qualified candidates than you, even if they dont know python.
No, in a word. Not to the level you want to be at based on your other comment. Don't let that stop you though. As with getting fit and saving money, the best time to start is ten years ago. The second best time is today. [Teach Yourself Programming In Ten Years](https://norvig.com/21-days.html) [Here's a decent course by the author of that blog post.](https://eu.udacity.com/course/design-of-computer-programs--cs212)
Programming ain't a memory skill, so skip the nootropics and working your ass off every day for 6 weeks. You can fairly quickly learn enough to write some useful-ish stuff and you might be able to get an internship with some more open-minded companies. Paid, because _NEVER TAKE UNPAID INTERNSHIPS_. You will lack experience to get a "proper" job, though, and there's nothing you can do to skip that - it's not just from memorizing a bunch of things, or even learning data structures and algorithms. So much about it is actually learning to communicate, understand real-world limitations, and knowing yourself and how you deal with different problems.
Learning Python and learning to program are different things. If you were an expert programmer (10+ years) in various languages you could be somewhat productive in Python in a week. If you’ve never programmed a day in your life it could take many months to really fully “get it”. But that will depend highly on your aptitude and learning style. I’d say dive and see how it goes. If you really enjoy it then it won’t feel like work and however long it takes you will enjoy it. If you hate it then no amount of time will seem bearable.
thank you for sharing the article, was a good read
Thanks, I'm going to give it a try!
Unfortunately, I'm having trouble just getting a server set up.
I did something similar in Ruby a few years back. I didn't like the fact that it reused the same image for everything of similar colors. Therefore I changed the algorithm to randomize the selected image as long as the color didn't go too far off in color.
Unfortunately, I'm having trouble just getting a server set up. I have no experience whatsoever with it, and even though AWS is the easiest way to get started, I can't even seem to SSH into it. It's a problem a lot of people apparently share when troubleshooting. I'm sure there's a solution--thousands of people use it successfully--but I wasn't able to find any luck and don't think I can set up my project in time with AWS.
I think the architecture would be ideal, except I cannot actually login to it using Windows or WSL. I can test with Linux later, but it's not practical for me.
As others have suggested, a raspberry pi can be cost effective to run in your own home, tho a keyboard/terminal or SSH would be necessary. A raspberry PI kit goes for about $50USD. If you are looking to connect with your python scripts outside your home, a remote server probably provides the most flexibility. There are plenty of options in addition to AWS, including Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Digital Ocean. Perhaps take a look at the AWS lightsail product where it does provide a browser-based SSH client that might work on mobile. Costs start around $3.50/mth. https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/lightsail-how-to-connect-to-your-instance-virtual-private-server Depending on the nature of the scripts, serverless is might also be an option. I've been making use AWS Lambda for about 4 years now. I updated a script yesterday to make use of python 3.7, but python 2.7 is still supported. You can interact with your scripts via the browser but I would not recommend navigating the AWS console via a mobile device like a phone on a regular basis. Serverless would be the best bet when you are looking for complete automation. - https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/ - https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/functions/ - https://cloud.google.com/functions/
It’s a common English phrase. It means something is heavy or burdensome. A ton of stuff is a lot of stuff. Stuff in python are things like variables, classes and functions.
traditional web apps 10 years ago were rendered server side. there was no react 10 years ago, and javascript was very very schizophrenic and browser dependent. So either he's an old horse, or he's someone who just discovered python and html and he wanted to play way more than recommended.
If you are concerned with the quality of your education, maybe you should pay tuition and attend courses
What does the zerg flag symbol have to do with python? https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Zerg
I've done java before and semi recently converted to python. The first bg difference is unlike java you can do almost anything with the vast default python libraries. Also the glorious and infamous PyPy which is an extensive library of 3rd of modules that make life so much easier.
I second the lambda idea but also, just general advice if you can't access your instance via SSH: * Does it have a public IP? If not, you're gonna have to set up a VPN or have some kind of public jump box. * Are your security groups configured to accept SSH traffic from your machine? * Ensure that you have the correct credentials. For Amazon Linux instances the default user is "ec2-user" and whatever key you set up in AWS. Other AMIs may require a different user. * Ensure that the correct private key is being used when connecting to the SSH instance. You can enable verbose output (-v) when calling ssh to show which private keys are being used.

Nobody's mentioned it because as the others have explained it's recursion in C, rather than in Python, so `setrecursionlimit()` won't do anything.
I think you didn't deserve the downvotes you've got. But I also think you're too pessimistic. Hopefully convenient OO APIs on the higher levels will finally make OS developers appreciate convenient OO APIs on the lower levels. The general direction of the software development should be to abstract (from details) and unify (standardize). So API of pathlib, while not perfect, is a step in that direction.
Most likely just how that run averaged, the code I used is linked in the post. When I run it now I get values around 50ms, which makes more sense.
A comma should be okay. The process isn't very automated at the moment, as we're currently migrating the back-end of our website and are using a temporary sign-up process.
It looks like auditing the course allows you access until the beginning of August and the finger problems and i think problem sets are available. The Midterm and Final exams are restricted unless you pay for the certificate, which I may do.
Sorry not my first language
I’m confused I never said I didn’t and I wasn’t complaining about it. It was a simple question. I took this and paid for it because I wanted to and had the time. Maybe you should take the stick out of your ass and fuck off?
The finger problems are mainly for practice and are only 10% of the final grade. Problem sets are about 40% of the total grade and the midterm and final exams make up the bulk. From my understanding the exams change with each course iteration. The problem sets appear to remain the same, however, you'll be doing yourself a disservice looking up someone else's solutions.
Not a problem 🤗 Honestly, you were able to get your point across and that’s the most important part. Good job and keep up the great work on learning another language!
Not even close. You may learn a lot of the syntax and the very basics of language, but python has an incredibly high skill ceiling that could probably take a decade or longer to reach, I imagine. There's an awful lot to learn.

Did you forget to include the resources you wanted to share?
You mean [PyPi](https://pypi.org) (**Py**thon **P**ackage **I**ndex). [PyPy](https://pypy.org) is an alternative Python implementation featuring a just-in-time compiler as opposed to the default CPython implementation.
My mistake but yes
I can’t really speak Spanish, so I’ll go ahead and respond in English. Can you perhaps provide a link to the code so that all the formatting can be included?
I would even say nootropics won't help. Planning your schedule/life around drugs doesn't help.
good bot
That sounds like Dash/Flask. If you have stuff that you need doing in Python Eg Pandas and Numpy stuff, then it makes sense to code up a front end in Python as part of it, rather than do it in JS and have to deal with two different codebases and inter process communication.
 Do not worry, I could understand your English, but, I do not understand what you mean by "Can you perhaps provide a link to the code so that all the formatting can be included?". Sorry, I just copied and pasted my code, there's no more. They are simple methods. But if you explain what else to do to get help, I'll gladly do it.

how can i smooth the graph out
The only way to find out is to run it under a profiler. But even then, this is the sort of "clever trick"/micro-optimization that won't give a big enough benefit to justify writing less-readable code. The dictionary-as-switch is nice specifically for replacing single assignments. I wouldn't try to stretch it much past that. Also, as others have pointed out, don't put function calls in the dictionary: {'value1': doThing1(), 'value2': doThing2()}[someVariable] When the dictionary gets created, all the values are evaluated, meaning all of the functions are called no matter what `someVariable` is set to.

I see. Thanks for explaining
You are probably running into issues with AWS because you haven’t configured your security policies. AWS blocks everything by default, including ssh. You have to enable it. If you want a quick and easy solution, I recommend digital ocean. A small droplet is like $5/mo and it’s a lot easier to configure than AWS.
Data frames do have slicing functionality. You used it in the sample code you posted (iloc[:,0]). For the problem in this comment, use int(len(datafft)/2).
So as per usual someone is complaining about the store that did nothing to impact their current process.
Always been the Windows way doesn't necessarily mean it was the best way.
Oh! Now I understand. So what you're really looking for is a (preferably free) server to run code on remotely?
Smoothing the graph inevitably loses information, which usually isn't desirable. However, if you really want to, this can be accomplished by taking the average of adjacent data points. Something like, n=2 For i in range(n,len(spec)-n): spec[i] = mean(spec[i-n:i+n]) Increasing n should increase the amount of smoothing. But note the first and last n points will not be smoothed. A better way is to use an apodozing function in the velocity domain, which basically amounts to multiplying your velocity data by a function like a gaussian before taking the fft. You can play around with this, but I won't go over it in detail.
Oh probably a good idea. Remember OP if people copy my solution I submitted first! Though given the complexity I wouldn't be surprised if people had near exact same solutions
Or maybe the ex-dev really didn't like javascript? I would love to have a better Python in the browser ecosystem!
I can not put the pyinstaller because it exceeds the allowed length.
Maybe so! I usually try to introduce myself (I'm Aaron, by the way), and I put my job title(s) in my profile. I'm also a freelance developer in Austin and python trainer--pleased as punch if everyone knows who I am and what I'm up to. &amp;#x200B; Jump to source and official docs are so awesome. Yeah, it's open source docs, plus highlighted AI-driven usage patterns from public Github code. The dev team pays close attention to [support@kite.com](mailto:support@kite.com), so that's probably the fastest way to get anything fixed. As a PyCharm user I'm happy to help too of course (:
No. If you have an aptitude, and put in 12 hours a day, learning a full stack, then in 5 or 6 month you might be marketable.
I used Dash in one of our projects, because it involved a lot of data visualization, any idea if this might be the case?
That'd be my guess, that he's oldschool; this is *exactly* how i would approach the problem, and i was an ASP/PHP dev for years. Why use fancy javascript bullshit to clutter up the code when i can just generate clean HTML serverside.
There's definitely database calls involved but I don't think on a scale that you assume.
Use a while loop. It'll be faster. Cheating the problem by increasing the stack size works up to a point, but is slower and doesn't solve the problem.
In for details
I love the fact that your TLDR mentioned Poetry, it's probably the best Python packaging tool out there.
&gt; It doesn't matter what your intentions are. It does though - I further specified that if a result was that this becomes a de facto help subreddit that we would once again rejig the rules. Context is important! With respect to what you've said about "engaged users", I think that generally you're looking at things entirely through the filter of what *you* want, and not what generally serves the subreddit. A lot of people who have engaged here are actually tentatively in favour (though I admit a lot of people aren't). &gt; Flair is a way to filter FOR not to filter OUT. I use flair to filter things out all the time, in a number of different ways. It's actually pretty easy to do so. Thinking of flair as "filter for" instead of "filter out" is probably making your personal reddit experience worse. &gt; I think you underestimate how bad things can get, and how much work will be involved in corralling necessarily ignorant contributors. I have a very good idea about how "bad" things can get, and as I said I am quite ready to immediately make changes based on what happens. &gt; And it is not something you can simply or easily revert Why would you think this? We've already gone through this change one time (the first time people requested that we disallow "learning" posts) and it wasn't particularly difficult to do.
Thanks a lot.Its a beautiful solution. I've just implemented that its working very fast for 4K images but the file size doesn't seem to reduce as much as it did before(original code).I've tried different interpolation factors like CUBIC and LANCZOS4 but the file size of distorted image is close to original image.Why do you think it happens?

It really depends how good you are. I learned python from just a few hours a week for several years while working on my Chemistry PhD, and in interviews, I outperform most people who put 4 years into a full-time CS degree. So which side of it do you think you're on? You can start working on it, and see how easily it comes to you.

&gt; With respect to the flair, assuming this takes place, what is the expected timeline on applying it to posts? /u/kungming2 knows the exact time (the author of the bot I'm proposing) but I think it's pretty close to immediate, and nearly all the feedback I've gotten from users about interacting with the bot is positive. &gt; mods have generally abstained from removing most learning posts based on what I've seen I haven't purposefully done this, but generally, I do the majority of moderator actions here, and if I have a busy week, or if my time that I take for reddit is taken up with other things, then the queue may have hours, days (or even weeks) where things don't get removed. Ideally, I'd like the community to mostly be able to take care of things themselves, and I would like to have a ruleset that enables that, because I think this is generally a great community that can do so. &gt; If a post is marked as help, do a few things automatically. Automatically remove help posts, with a message requesting the user ask the question in /r/learnpython instead. This *may* be the first step we take (no matter what is overall decided as a course of action), to start introducing people to the flair bot. &gt; After 24 hours the OP... [can have the post reinstated, given certain circumstance] I think this adds some workflow that feels a bit clunky; I also think it's slightly backwards! Not to put too fine a point on it, but I think that people will probably get better answers at r/LearnPython than they get here, and that will probably continue. &gt; if a post gets removed and then is 'unremoved' by a mod, reddit puts it back to the top of new list automatically, so it'll get seen. I believe that is the intended behaviour. Long story short - your ideas are definitely good ones, and I'm going to put them on the list of possibilities.
&gt; how about restricting pics in posts like on /r/learnpython to cut down on the low quality content meant for karma farming. We could certainly do that, but I want to consider the implications of it and look through our history to see what sort of valuable content would be missed from things like this. I feel like there are some lighter / fluffier posts that people really have enjoyed (pictures of Guido, that one with the baby, other logo discussions and things) that would be removed by this, and while I don't necessarily think those are all great content, I think "fluff" content is definitely something that is expected (and rewarded) by reddit in general.
&gt; With respect to the flair, assuming this takes place, what is the expected timeline on applying it to posts? I'm very in favor of flair and I think it'll help force low effort blog posts to self identify, and give a way to classify them more easily. I can answer this! Artemis acts on posts that are at least **five minutes old**, to give OPs a chance to select a flair after they submitted. If the post is over five minutes old and still has no flair, Artemis will send the message and/or remove the post, depending on the mode it's in. Artemis will continue monitoring the post for flair updates for up to **24 hours** after it was submitted. If the OP doesn't pick a flair during that time, then Artemis will stop monitoring it after that time period has passed. (cc u/aphoenix)
I have only so far used Win32 com to automate attachment download from outlook and importing the excel as dataframe. Also I have automated few reports which I send to dl through outlook using Win32. None of these tasks took any time to implement as the code was pretty straightforward. Controlling Excel through Win32 doesn't make any sense IMO.
Here's one [post](https://pbpython.com/windows-com.html) I wrote a while back.

Honest question: How is it better to have Failure/Success unwrapping code everywhere instead of having try/except everywhere?
yeah sure https://github.com/ABSanthosh/Pyridine-ChemicalStructurer also wait for the webapp....i am releasing it soon.
☺️ It’s all good. I was only half serious.
Google cloud scheduler is built for running cron jobs. It even takes the cron syntax for scheduling. You can use it to call any http endpoint, including external URLs.
Just curious: why is that? The reason I'm looking into is, is that for most people in my field (i.e accounting) rely on excel as the front end. Anything outside of that for analysis is a non-starter. I can carry out computations in pandas, but for presentation/distribution, excel is the primary form of presentation.
I stubbornly [continue to insist](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/blkdp9/a_comparison_of_poetry_vs_other_tools/emvfb2h/) that pip-tools+flit+zsh-aliases is a better solution that demands less from collaborators and tinkerers and is more widely compatible with existing personal workflows. If you post an example set of steps to achieve something with your setup, I'll post the equivalent with mine.
Thankyou so much

Thanks a lot man!
As far as I see you still use scipy functions. Why not just explicitly use finite-difference scheme for the Hessian? Also you may want to look into pytorch and it's autograd framework (or any other similar package), which does kind of symbolic differentiation using computational graphs.
Sure and thanks ☺☺
Following this discussion.
It looks like you’re mixing Rust and Python. `Result[‘UserProfile’, Exception]` is `Result&lt;UserProfile, SomeError&gt;` (`unwrap()` and all), and `@safe` is like `?`. You can’t fool me OP!
This is so bizarre to read because it's still perfectly fine to go with a server side rendered web app. My web experience is with Rails, so I don't know where the split is for Python frameworks, but the idea that someone would be baffled by this baffles me.

Professor Leonard is really good on YouTube, and 3brown1blue has excellent videos explaining concepts.
Thanks for sharing this! I actually came by it after listening to the Talk Python [episode](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/200/escaping-excel-hell-with-python-and-pandas) you had w/ Michael Kennedy. That was a great episode as it covered alot of similar thoughts I had about excel and pandas. Given that it's been a few years since that post, have you ventured into bigger projects w/ the library? Or even heard from others that have? Looking through the comments in the post, folks are dabbling in the library.
&gt;That said, it's good that basically all major OSs/distros have committed to phasing out Python2 one way or another - even RHEL/CentOS have stepped up to the plate. Makes sense to me because it will not be supported at all anymore in just 6 months....
I probably need to make another leap of faith and try it. Last time when I invested time into pipenv and switched environments I got a lot of problems that constantly consuming a lot of time.
Curious how this works out for ya. I've only done it from C# and VB6 myself. What's the bonus of being able to use python in this case?
 python3.6 -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate pip install requirements.txt Have not failed me yet. Sometimes I install the distro venv sudo apt install python-virtualenv virtualenv -p python3.6 venv source venv/bin/activate pip install requirements.txt

thanks for the input! I will likely not be applying to programming jobs in 6 weeks but want to start building a resume with programming experience and want to know enough to be able to solve basic problems. From what I understand a full time programming job is attainable from a self taught education but likely after a year or so of studying as well as building programs. I have some IT and Comp Security experience and think knowing coding will be a big plus for my resume. Is one year more reasonable, to have substantial knowledge of it?
Man. I'm pro in both Excel and Python. And I suggest you to learn Excel vba and code there for Excel tasks and keep Python for really important stats/data science tasks. It's going to be easier and faster. Automating office from the outside is a Pandora's box.
bullshii. this wasnt learn python dummy
damn, your trigger threshold is low
Did you read the response at all? Notably this: &gt; No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers. It doesn't matter what level of question you're on, this isn't the place to ask for technical help.
I used Win32 com to automate edits I need to make every week to a PowerPoint presentation. At every point, it felt very hack-y. The documentation for PowerPoint VBA is lacking, there's no way to inspect objects, changing colors is needlessly complicated, and the text of a shape is in TextRange.TextFrame.Text. Took a minute to figure that out. On top of that, it's slow and feels very kludgey. I probably wouldn't send it to someone else to use, especially because it has to open up PowerPoint to connect to it, and I'm not sure how it would act if someone did something in powerpoint while it was already running. Unfortunately, the pptx library can't even copy and paste a slide, so win32 com was my only viable option.
Well i know u are right i mean , after all i should be more serious asking questions that regard of my future in a way but...

Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
You are expecting folks to use two different tools, plus some custom scripts you wrote AND to follow a specific workflow. As a person that collaborates frequently, I would find these requirements in a project intolerable.
But, you do understand that workflow has failed many other developers, right? The frustration with the packaging situation wasn't fabricated out of whole cloth by rabble rousers in the python community
There is no right or wrong language to learn machine learning do you just have to learn a language in python is one of them tensor flow is one of the platforms that uses python as an interface. Go to a local meet up and meet people who know this stuff and ask them face-to-face get them as a mentor because I know what you’re getting random answers from people on the Internet and you could get easily wrong answers.
Pipenv uses its own configuration file (`Pipfile`). Poetry uses the [upcoming standard](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/) `pyproject.toml`.
Win32 Com Library is great and has cool use cases for Windows OS. Recently I did some work automating Excel and Word documents. As the solution was deployed on Linux, I used pyexcel \[1\], python-docx \[2\] and python-pptx \[3\] to work with Excel, Word and PowerPoint respectively. &amp;#x200B; \[1\] [https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel](https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel) \[2\] [https://github.com/python-openxml/python-docx](https://github.com/python-openxml/python-docx) \[3\] [https://github.com/scanny/python-pptx](https://github.com/scanny/python-pptx)
Nice write up, I wonder if reviewing (and improving) this page may be a sensible next step. See [https://packaging.python.org/](https://packaging.python.org/) Regarding the python wheels including compiled code, I suggest to look at [https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-binary-extensions/](https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-binary-extensions/) And more specifically at the integration of cmake and setuptools using [https://scikit-build.readthedocs.io](https://scikit-build.readthedocs.io)
&gt; Don't bother with Python 3, start with Python 3 You meant don't bother with 2, right?
/u/stebox Great post. Please capitalize Poetry so people don't confuse it with the art of poems, and link at least the first mention to the tool's [homepage](https://poetry.eustace.io/docs/), so readers can easily check it out.
I am not. What the person needs to use or do depends on what they want to achieve, and even then they've got options. For example, if they just want to install the project's existing dependencies and get working, pip install -r requirements.txt is perfect. But they can also use any tool which understands `requirements.txt`. The aliases/scripts are not necessary, even for modifying the dependencies. I find them convenient. All that's really needed is pip-tools and a text editor.
\&gt; if you really want not to use poetry and want to stay the old way: &amp;#x200B; Not sure if this was purposefully written confusingly. I had to read it a few times. It would be clearer to say &amp;#x200B; \&gt; if you really do not want to use poetry...
First of all thanks for replying really appreciate that. I understand there is no right or wrong language but what I meant to ask was that people who work on these do they think is there another language that does the job better or is easier so I would rather start there since I have a limited amount of time And Unfortunately I can't go to any local meet ups as there aren't any where I live and people here are my best bet. I do have something in mind and my purpose for asking this question was that some extra opinion from people who have worked on this wouldn't hurt. And once again thanks.
I can't speak to the specifics of COM calls from Python, but I can say that in my experience with COM (mostly using it through Powershell for BizTalk admin stuff), I would never do anything with COM calls if I could find literally any other way to do the thing I need to do. It's super slow even from Powershell - and I have to imagine Powershell's integration with Windows/COM is going to be more robust than Python's.
Does anybody know how you could use this inside your type signatures, I'm pretty lost :/
I tried Portry but for some reason virtualenv does not work they way I expected. With Pipenv I just do \`pipenv shell\` and I'm inside the virutual env and run the python version that was used to create the env. &amp;#x200B; With Poetry when I run shell, I still get the system python and not the one from virutal env. &amp;#x200B; Not sure what I'm doing wrong, or maybe if that's how it's supposed to be.
I have done lots of Python packaging and I have had no issues using pip/setuptools and PyInstaller to do anything I needed. Everything from python-only packaging to standalone distributables. Personally, I wouldn't call it "the dumpster fire that is python packaging". I have done packaging with many other languages and Python actually does a great job.
Have you tried filing a bug report?
Ok, so I need \`pyenv\`. Will give that a try. I was just using \`homebrew\`
That is pretty cool
Thank you. No matter how old I get, I always appreciate more logging documentation (I'm not joking). I'm also popping in to give a shout out to [structlog](https://structlog.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) which I find very sane, especially in combination with something like [s6-log](http://skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-log.html).
Thanks for that shout out. I have something new to learn now.
They will come here first for help, simply because "I need help with some python, and this is /r/python", just as they do now.
VSCode isn't smart enough to run Python code that hasn't been saved to disk. Save your file to an actual location with an actual name, and then try again to run it.
It's not my project, but I'm trying to improve the docs a bit. Particularly helpful for me was figuring out that the default configuration is equivalent to: structlog.configure( processors=[ structlog.processors.StackInfoRenderer(), structlog.processors.format_exc_info, structlog.processors.TimeStamper(), structlog.dev.ConsoleRenderer() ], wrapper_class=structlog.BoundLogger, context_class=dict, logger_factory=structlog.PrintLoggerFactory(), cache_logger_on_first_use=False ) So for example in one of my projects where I don't want structlog to handle timestamps, and to output json most of the time, I have: def mk_logger(json=True): structlog.configure(processors=[ structlog.processors.format_exc_info, structlog.processors.JSONRenderer(sort_keys=True) if json else structlog.dev.ConsoleRenderer() ]) return structlog.get_logger()

Yup I have one web server that serves server cached content in a static page. To allow clients to pull and render the content instead would make no sense.
I actually kinda like this idea; when I'm in a pickle with something, I don't much bother about the mechanism by which I get assistance. TBF, I think I'd prefer most of my help with a lot less of people's personality, character, and bias attached thereto.
Two issues I've encountered with that approach: Virtualenvs are not portable, and passing `requirements.txt` around means your final install machine has to slurp things from the public internet.
Seems interesting but I'm in a bit late for something, could I get a tl;dr about what's wrong with the setuptools and twine official method that I've been following so far? I'll read the article when I get back :D

I do a lot of email automation with jinja2 + the com interface - it was easy to learn. Just make sure to use raw strings for filepaths otherwise it freaks out a little.
An hundred upvotes for this (FYI I'm actually none of those things; I'm just an old IT guy who has decided to 'own' python as a programmning language).
The real answer is that it's a preference thing; some developers feel that exceptions are anti-patterns. But the reality is that languages sort of define good patterns and anti-patterns in some languages are preferred in other.
This is GOLD Jerry! Thanks! Been looking for something like this as I gave up after rabbit holing on it for a whole evening.
What happens after you saved them? Is there a reason you don't want to simply save the downscaled version? An upscaled pixelated version doesn't really benefit jpeg in any way, as it has sharp edges from pixelation to pixelation square
I think the point is that if we look at the ratio of "community posts" that are "need help" posts vs. the number of "community posts" that are "Advanced aka Elitist" posts, that the former far outnumber the latter, and so the will of the community could arguably be said to be at odds with the will of the elite... ...not to put too fine a point on it, but by the logic that is allegedly driving both moderation and this discussion, that being the case you would need somewhere else (e.g., /r/advancedpython) to host the ever-popular PEP newsflashes.
SAme here. I made my first package in 2011 or 2012. I've never had a problem making packages or installing them. I don't think it's a dumpster fire at all...
It's certainly \*more\* reasonable, but again, unless you're applying for jobs that are not very competitive at all, there will always be applicants who have more experience and/or some kind of credential, and unless you have something else to distinguish yourself, why not hire those other people?
Unrelated to the actual question (it seems to be answered well) is that using filters is not a real sieve. It is exactly the same as checking against all previous primes but with the added overhead of the filter. (You may already know this but I didn't for a long time) This paper explains it well: https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~oneill/papers/Sieve-JFP.pdf
Ahh, that's a different question, supplemental knowledge for other IT work. I'd say nowadays I'd avoid IT staff who can't code _at least a bit_, and yes, you can get "useful" knowledge within that time, without spending on drugs. Best thing to do, though, is to find an application of it for yourself, otherwise you don't really _know_ that you've learned it. And don't mark yourself as an expert, but you should be able to read scripts and understand them with some effort, and if you use the skill, you should be able to comfortably write your own within a year of actual work.
Exactly what I was thinking. This seems like adding a lot of boilerplate to make Python behave like a different language, for equivalent functionality.
I'll throw my infinite generator into the gauntlet: https://gist.github.com/arlyon/0d90932adcb5a8a05b0bb6fa21518a04#file-eratosthenes-py
Pycharm
It’s working now, thanks. I have no “output” when I run my code but it is going through the terminal, which is fine. Is it fine?
I am in your boat, but I also challenge you to remember when you were new to python. This stuff is overly complex. I'm not sure if poetry and this article is the solution, but there has to be a better way.
At an old job I had good success automating some tasks in Outlook and Excel using python. I used pywin32 for Outlook, but used openpyxl for the Excel portion. Both can be found on pypi and are relatively painless to use.
Coding is a big plus for your resume. I can say that personally, it is letting me do things at my job currently that nobody else would likely be doing. Not that people here arent extremely capable of doing what I'm doing, but my position provides direct involvement with the tasks I'm automating, as well as the necessary free time to do it (so it essentially is one of my job duties now). However, if you are going into the IT game, or anything remotely related, you should also learn your OS's shell language. For Linux/OSX, this is bash; for Windows, powershell. Most of my automations currently are based in bash, because we have to work with command line tools. This makes it extremely easy, even though everything is technically possible in python.
You should write that this is about *applications*. if people want to develop packages, they should use flit, and as loose dependency version specifications as possible, not specific frozen versions (else people run into stuff with incompatible versions).
Someone spends a few weeks learning about something, has an elementary understanding of the subject, and almost no practical experience or real world use cases under their belt but goes on to proclaim something is a dumpster fire and should be built anew. This is such a common occurrence, I feel like it should have a name by now.
this sub was awesome ~10 years ago. Every dev of every web framework/library would post here. You could actively engage with them, have lively debates about technical direction etc... That doesn't happen anymore. I believe /r/learnpython was an attempt to give a place for all the newcomers to figure out python instead of overrunning this forum in hopes to preserve what good was had. I guess it failed and quality of content and discussion has gone downhill ever since. accordingly pycon has also had a seemingly dramatic drop in quality of talks in recent years presumably in order to cater to the newbs. But, I can't argue with numbers so IF what you say is true and the majority of people subscribed here are indeed learners of python and not users of python(or elitists as you put it), then so be it, I can still downvote and hide stuff and throw in my .02 on my perception of the quality of the posts if I so choose.
I've crrated a script using pywin32 to crrated template for Outlook emails with data from Excel using xlrd library
&gt;YAML is a can of worms and a potential security threat. Not sure how it's a can of works, IMO it's the easiest to read and write of the bunch and use it for a lot of projects. Yes you do have to make sure you're using a safe loader, but same is true with XML or PHP's INI settings. (And IIRC you get a warning with ruamel.yaml if you do an unsafe load)
I use the term 'Elitist' because you use it to seperate a single community of people into 'those who have it' and 'those who dont'. I don't imagine that I will ever learn everything there is to know about python, and I'm equally sure you don't everything there is to know about it now. Speaking of downvotes, here's one for you.
Why not just use the git module?
damn, that downvote cost me my job. how will I feed my family now? I guess you sure showed me.
You will still come across tutorials which has minimal JS usage (the Flask tutorial for one). Python rendered websites can do the job, but it has some scaling drawbacks. For an intranet web app, I would still consider this for a small project. Not so much for external facing sites .
This is what I’m curious about. I’m forced to use VBA only (can’t get anything else installed), so I’ve found it to be painful, but much more powerful than I initially thought. With all the references you can import, a lot of problems can be solved with VBA.
in future, /r/learnpython and read the sidebar
I have never had any of these issues with pip or virtualenvs. I use pyenv to manage my python versions and envs and find it all so much more wonderful than anything else I've used for library management.
I second that, i assumed it was meant in the art form at first
&gt;Personally, I wouldn't call it "the dumpster fire that is python packaging". I have done packaging with many other languages and Python actually does a great job. Found the C++ programmer.
If python packaging is a dumpster fire, C++ packaging is every tyre in the world thrown into a nuclear reactor.
You can start by using spaces over tabs if you aren't already :)
Thanks
&gt; Not sure how it's a can of works It's a can of worms because the spec is enormous, which means that libraries which parse it are also enormous, and while a small subset of its features are very easy to reason about, it is far more complex than it needs to be for most applications. &gt; Yes you do have to make sure you're using a safe loader i.e. use a subset of YAML, i.e. not use YAML. &gt; same is true with XML or PHP's INI settings INI being terrible is not an argument for YAML being good.
Such melodrama. In any case, the up/downvote is the currency of the realm, and you earned your wage. So there it is, for whatever it's worth, which aint much.
Python does an OK job which looks spectacular when you hold it up next to C++ etc. But look at it next to rust/cargo and it pales a bit.
Xlwings uses the Win32 API under the hood
As well as complex, it's very inconsistently documented.
 😁
Seen you seem knowledgeable, it possible to automate usage of programs on Windows (emulators, media players etc)
Rust has the benefit of time though. &amp;#x200B; Lessons learned from legacy languages is probably Rust's biggest advantage. &amp;#x200B; Being the new hotness, less so.
r/learnprogramming is where I usually go
r/learnpython
Are you talking about server side rendering? If so, this is a hilarious post.
Sounds like javascript to me.
Right, and here we are discussing how to make python packaging more intuitive, modern, and stable. The response to that shouldn't be "let's just accept that python packaging is sub-par because it's an older language".
what are you having issues with? When you make a new ec2 instance it gives you a private key file. When you go to set up your connection in putty or whatever, use that private key, passwordless.
I've been looking for similar resources too, and I wish there was more than Mark Hammond's book. I have learned enough win32 api stuff to put together NiceWin, which has Python functions for several win32 functions. It might be instructive for folks who want to learn how to do win32 stuff from Python: https://github.com/asweigart/nicewin (but this isn't related to COM stuff)
I appreciate the writeup. I haven't been following the discussions about python packaging very closely. I guess my needs have been simple enough that the old ways have been fine for me. Up until now when I come across discussions about python packaging problems they never seem to explain them very well and I'm left wondering what all the fuss is about. This is the first time I seem to have gotten some idea about the issues people are having and why they are looking for other solutions. Thanks for putting the time in.
Thanks for this!
I don't disagree with that at all. Though I've never really had major problems w/ packaging.
you might be referring to jinja templating.
Yeah, Python is far from the worst, but it’s not the best either. I think it’s less it’s a “dumpster fire”, because it’s actually decent, it’s just that a lot of the modern languages (rust, Go, c#, etc) have done such a fantastic job with packaging these days it makes Python look worse than it is.
I'd start with Flask over Django. And the official python docs are fun to read through!
I am not sure you should be releasing packages if you are that new to a language
TLDR: François Chollet, aka "the [keras](https://keras.io/) guy", gave what I thought was a really good talk at a Kaggle conference a couple of months back discussing the importance of developer experience. The marquee quote: &gt; "Good tools are how you build great products, win competitions, get papers published.". His three API design principles are: 1. Deliberately design end-to-end workflows focused on what users care about. 2. Reduce cognitive load for your users. 3. Provide helpful feedback for your users. Anyway, I though it was a good talk, so I wrote it up (with some comments). Hopefully this'll help these ideas reach a larger audience.
Wow, had no idea.
You absolutely can learn the basics of Python programming and get a good handle on it, but you absolutely will not be in a position to get a job. Many bootcamps have their students study for most of their waking hours, and they still take 12 to 16 weeks and even then getting a job is still hit-or-miss. However! Don't let that stop you from trying and learning. Programming is something that self-taught people can get themselves jobs in.
I wrote some free books here: https://inventwithpython.com "Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python" covers Pygame in the last few chapters, and after that you can read "Making Games with Python &amp; Pygame"
Nah it's not Jinja. I know what Jinja looks like.
BTW that site looks like shit in mobile.
I'm actually going the other way right now, as JVM languages are way more popular in distributed systems/big data tools. What are your reasons for moving to python?
Heres the code: https://pastebin.com/mr8stzKx And a high resolution 8000x8000 image: https://i.ibb.co/Hg7nMTp/Man.png
/r/learnpython read the sidebar don't post pictures of code
A readme and requirements.txt? This really isn't your first project is it? 😉 For real though, this looks awesome. I might try to get it working in the USA. Well done.
sorry, but can you help me?
Wow. Thank you for the feedback everybody. I went out for a beer and I came home to my inbox exploded and plenty of upvotes. I will read each one of the posts and integrate each of your comments in the posts. It's quite late here so I'm going to bed now, see you in 8 hours.
Oh not at all, I've been coding Python for a long time, but it's the first script that interacts even a little with the real world! My next step is to buy a rasperry PI or something and have a real temperature sensor and all :) And that sounds neat, you'll probably have to use a different API than the fmi I've used, thus you'll need to change the `t2m_from_xmldict()` function too, but keep us updated if you manage to make a US version!
makes sense because rendering is a costly operation that you offload to the client if you can.
dont use "+" with strings use "," instead.
‘Bout fuckin time! I’ve been waiting for Windows to adopt Python compatibility for a long time, so this just made my day
It gives this error now: Traceback (most recent call last): File "C:\Users\guilh\OneDrive\Ambiente de Trabalho\Pasta\Andante\andante.py", line 11, in &lt;module&gt; file.write("Tens" , int(res[1] - spent) , " viagens.") TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'
I suspected so. I started from a jekyll template and tinkered with it a bit, but I am not particularly good at css and it wasn't probably good to begin with either. I would really love a better template but I did not find anything decent. Any ideas?
I'm getting this error now: Traceback (most recent call last): File "C:\\Users\\guilh\\OneDrive\\Ambiente de Trabalho\\Pasta\\Andante\\[andante.py](https://andante.py)", line 11, in &lt;module&gt; file.write("Tens" , int(res\[1\] - spent) , " viagens.") TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'
Great job!
I use hexo. It has some pretty cool open source themes.
uhm... actually I have a fair bit of experience, but I am targeting an audience here.
I take it this guy didn’t docstring anything? No man pages either?
 ("Tens" + int(res[-1] - spent) + " viagens.") You're trying to concatenate a string and int. Can't do that. If the results of ([res[-1] - spent) is an Int you should use string formatting: "Tens {} viagens.".format(res[-1] - spent)
hmm maybe its having issues with you putting an integer with a string, try removing the "int()".
it gives the same error
it gives the same error
I suppose it's worth mentioning that at one point in my (private) exchange with OP it was suggested to me that I should go and establish my own sub if I didn't like the way things were done on this one. I did precisely this, at the time it was suggested; it has looser posting rules and has incorporated flair from day one. If I thought it'd get any traffic I'd stop trying to find out how to delete it. It's called /r/pythoncoders
I rely on github to generate, so I target only jekyll. I used to rely on pelican, but the truth is that github pages is so convenient to use that I just gave up. I think I'll give it a try and fix the template tomorrow. I haven't checked it on other clients yet, but I just checked with safari and indeed it's not pleasant.
One more hreat quote: A good error message should answer three questions: What happened, in what context? What did the software expect? How can the user fix it?
What did you change?
Can I get that on a t-shirt or coffee mug, please?
the part that you commented
I have decided that it's not nearly so simple as it seems. Minimally one needs (in my opinion): requirements.in dev-requirements.in requirements.txt dev-requirements.txt setup.py setup.cfg (solely for setting [bdist_wheel] universal = 1) MANIFEST.in And then a script to invoke pip-compile -o requirements.txt requirements.in pip-compile -o dev-requirements.txt requirements.txt dev-requirements.in # i'll explain this in a moment Of note from above: * setup.py read from the .in files so that I have 1 source of truth for the abstract deps * which necessitates the MANIFEST.in * normal and dev requirements ought to be separate for obvious reasons * the pip-compile invocations as they are because: * requirements.txt is generated by itself so dev dependencies cannot affect normal dep versions * the recursive dev deps need to be based on the recursive normal reqs or else you'll end up in scenarios where the `requirements.txt` and `dev-requirements.txt` have different concrete versions for some deps &amp;#x200B; And I've only landed on these opinions after having my dependencies fucked and having to spend serious effort resolving all the mutually incompatible versions and nonsense that happens once you're in a bad state; and doing the same for others (at work) who got into similar straits. &amp;#x200B; Forget it, if you want similar guarantees across OSes or python versions &amp;#x200B; Contrasted with `poetry` which replaces all the above files with 1 manually curated file (and a lock file) and solves the coordination for versions across dev/normal reqs. And very nicely generates a lock file that is valid for all python versions that your code claims to be compatible with.
Nope he didn't. Really nice of him
I changed the phrasing, but yeah, I don't have big issues either. However, there's a lot of confusion on the topic and I am biased by being old, so I wanted to review what I knew in the face of the new developments. I focused in pipenv initially, but all considered I followed the sub advice and went with Poetry. It seems better overall.
I remember doing this on a commodore 64 in basic. It took all night to generate the image. Can your program zoom? Great fun and good job.
i didn’t see the whole answer, im changing it
Done. Thanks!
Why not just use `black`?
Thank you. :) I'm also writing an object oriented feed forward neural network. I got the feed forward to work, but that feedback algorithm is an ass kicker. All this, I hope, will contribute to my employment. Anyway, the next step is to generate a massive image. Will run the thing overnight.
lol "deprecating python" .
That’s so cool.
can you write how the full code will look like please? the res[-1] is an int value and spent and load are too
It can, but you have to manually change the position, zoom, and then re-render the image. Do you know of any fast, refreshable, per-pixel drawing libraries?
Thanks, I'll take a good look at this later. Can you provide an example set of *in files for me to recreate those problems with?
This is awesome!
How is the nn and the feedback algo related to the mandelbrot image? Or are these different projects?
Yeah, I didn't quite remember which Django version. We're probably on 1.11.5.
That sucks. Sounds like you’ll be down that rabbit hole for awhile. Hopefully it’s not as bad as you think it is after you’ve familiarized yourself with it a bit more.
Whats the probability you will have to?
I believe you can deploy to github with hexo. Check it out
Hopefully I wont, but we will use it a lot. It transforms series of lists of dictionaries and dictionaries adds a key value pair to each dictionary based off another series and concatenates them into one table. It is a very common problem we face
Different projects.
Lmao you're the one that got triggered
I was referring to the development environment. I merged your PR, thanks, but I'll clarify that tomorrow in more detail. I am literally collapsing (here it's 2 past midnight).
Sounds like a perfect time to write an absolutely massive comment. Sometimes my source files contain more comment than code in cases like this.
How many lines of code is it
That is one line I am referring to. The function is 3 lines
That is good advice
Looks fine in mobile to me. Only issue is that, due to the font, I find bit hard to tell if it's a comma or full stop.
I've got to say, I'm disappointed you didnt do this with turtles
What is the nn for?
I’ve used apophysis before. Just curious, how would you go about adding an animation feature (such as a 30 second zoom or another modification over time).
Sick
I enjoyed doing this too. Next steps of course are: 1. Fill up the other channels too but use different iterations. 2. Do the buddhabrot too. Congratulations on your Mandelbrot!
I don't know I think I am becoming very lazy and seeing python code is very enjoyable and straightforward... In fewer lines I can do a lot more
Display Stand: $999 Display Stand Support: $499
Yup but first I have to switch to Fahrenheit 😋
I see an assassin kiwi. Do you have the python application to diagnose me?
&gt; Do you know of any fast, refreshable, per-pixel drawing libraries? pygame is pretty fast. But the slow part of this problem is the iterating. You might be able to use numpy to speed up the calculations. Here is a simple numpy example: https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/numpy/auto_examples/plot_mandelbrot.html
&gt; that feedback algorithm is an ass kicker. pytorch is a great library for neural networks. Very simple and fast.
Curiosity mostly.
Ops, you are correct, let me edit that one. Thanks!
I build server side rendered apps to this day in django and use ajax to serve up the content. Seems like a pretty standard way of doing things if you don't care about using a front end framework.
This is what I do in my job as a data scientist. I care less about being fancy on the front end and care more about creating correct data in my models and displaying it to the user.
Not supported by core python devs. There’s a lot of python 2 code out there still. Someone - whether it be ActiveState or Google will be maintaining a version for at years. At minimum, RHEL 8 is out only a month and [supports python 2](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/11/14/python-in-rhel-8/) so there’s another 10 years of support there.
I'll re-comment if i have a chance to come up with one. but any combination of moto, boto, awscli, and botocore are common problem children. but in reality, any set of separate deps with any common ancestors will cause this even if you don't see errors, you'll see it uninstalling versions of those deps across installations of either (dev vs normal) compiled set of deps
What is this? Looks cool but I have never seen this before
Ok if I'm reading this correctly we're not talking about a regular server side rendered app (like pure django or flask), the guy wrote his very own Jinja+WTForms framework and there's zero abstraction between interface and data model. You're entering a mined field. How big is the project?
Since you’re already using a numpy array to store the values, you might find it faster to operate on the whole array at once instead of pixel by pixel.
This really exciting. New to programming in groups like this. After we submit the form how will we know weather we have been selected. Would that be through Discord direct message?
Amazing. Thanks for sharing.
lxml will create a model of the data. but you'll have some pain learning how to navigate. look up xpath
I understand the words you are saying, but I don't get why. For me, the hard part was twofold, 1. GTFO of Windows for any kind of development, and 2. Grok virtual environments We have decent solutions in the standard tool set, so why are we writing new tools?
I never thought of that. Thanks. I'll make sure to give it a try.
Luckily I've been tasked with re-writing that shit. But I'm going to keep it in an archive and see what he did.
Great work, keep it up.
nope. Just suck at regex.
Well done! I've been programming for over a decade and a Mandelbrot generator is still my go-to test application when I learn a new language
Very cool! :D There is so much joyt to be found along those lines of exploration. I did my first in Microsoft C (this was a long time ago on win3.1 ;) )
For those that don't know: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules
for the qualifier..can we use any library or it has to be 100% self made or something?
The difference is that the language is more popular now than before. There are lots more beginners. The other difference is that there was no rule explicitly allowing beginner questions. There will be now, with the explicit rule against them being explicitly removed. You should ask all those users in favor of the change how many questions they've answered over at r/learnpython in the last year.
OpenGL/WebGL!
That still needs to be converted to an image. You could skip that step by working directly on the image, which would be slower if you update one pixel at a time. But if you waited until the color was different than the last pixel, and drew a line when it changed rather than 1 pixel at a time, it could be faster. Probably not, but maybe. Source: coding fractals in Delphi on a 486. I'm sure nothing has changed since then.

opengl doesn't help at all with per-pixel drawing, you'd still need to modify the texture in CPU and upload it to the GPU, unless you did all the drawing in shaders themselves, but then that'd be a GLSL exercise, not a python one (and using opengl from python is actually more painful than doing it in C).
Go grab some esp8266 boards and some temp sensors! The boards have built in WiFi and you can program them with micropython. If you aren't in a rush for the stuff you can grab esp8266's for a couple bucks off AliExpress(along with the temp sensors, just not familiar with their costs). May take a month for it to actually get delivered but you can get all the components and supplies dirt cheap. Glad you posted this cause I completely forgot about a little project I had planned using that board to make a dumb fan into a smart fan. Might actually work on that this weekend lol. Thanks for sharing the project!

1. if you do any-kind of deployment or continues integration I recommend you check your `venv-site-packages` into source control. 2. While true if you use pure python libs changing `/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/easy-install.pth` to the correct path will allow you to reuse the `site-packages` you checked into git. The thing is I have been using `virtualenv` since 2010, and while python packaging is not perfect, I do not feel the pain all the people is blogging about, so i can just assume the problem lies with them?
Please post this at r/learnpython
Yea it’s called swift just pay 999$ for a Macbook Air and you can have it
Just read and parse it's stdout and stderr. Read about `subprocess.Popen()`.
On Windows it's probably another story, but for Linux and presumably Mac, the advantage of C++ not having its own system for distributing packages is that popular packages are handled by the distro repository maintainers themselves. Linking can be a pain, but it's still caused me much less headaches than pip installing Python packages. The use of packages in scripts is much better in Python though - everything wrapped by namespaces by default, and `from X import *` strongly discouraged; whereas in C++, even if the package has bothered to wrap itself in a namespace, the equivalent line - `using namespace X;` - is everywhere.
It's all about the advertising. Some time you sell an amazing product but its not represented correctly.
Next step: a motor driver for closing and opening the window automatically :)
Even better, optimize your algorithm. I did it. Years and years ago... lessee... right now you're computing that crazy fractal computation for every row and every column of pixels ya? What if, instead, you divide and conquer? compute the outline of the box doing mandelbrot for each pixel all the way around the border. Then split the screen into 4 smaller boxes with a vertical and a horizontal line of computed pixels down the middle. Ok, if any of the borders of our 4 cells have the same color all the way around the border, we can cheat and fill that box in with the color (including the slowest cells to compute, the black ones which are genuinely part of the mandelbrot set). If any of the borders were interrupted with a color, we got no choice, we have to recurse into that cell, split it into 4 and check all the borders again. So, there are going to be areas of the screen ( where the mandelbrot halo is busy) that will still take a long time to render. BUT, anywhere you have a region where the border is all color x, the entire space inside that border is O(1) ( woot!) The Efficiency of the rest of this approach is hard to figure out ( I think). But, the fact that we're splitting the space into 4 means it's log-base-4-to-the-something-or-other. Bonus, this turns out to be similar to all that quad-tree stuff you sometimes encounter for dealing with 2D spatial problems. I recall starting this approach at midnight, and having it coded and working by 6 in the morning :P ( a few decades back :P ) I also recall allowing user to pick corners for a new rendering rectangle to zoom in... and then feeding that into the divideAndConquerApproach(...) But, using double precision numbers for the Mandelbrot space eventually runs into problems... when the doubles are no longer adequate for the insanely small top-left/bottom-right, the fractal would still render, but blocky... kinda lo-res. I got around that one by using a double-double data-type from something called the Lydia math library. (Sorry, don't know python, this was all C++). ( I think I made a templated class for rendering and then when doubles were no longer adequate, switching on the fly to Lidia's double-double and being able to zoom in the mandelbrot to insanely small sizes). And then, once zoom is introduced, I think I used a stack to hold a the top-left/bottom-right coords of previous views so the user could go back a step ( but it re-rendered, haha :P ) Hope some of these late night ramblings help out.

That's great. For kicks, are you able to assign different colors to the halo outside the mandelbrot set? Based on the value of the number that's running off to infinity? eg: iirc, you repeat a formula, and if the number is still less than 1-ish? after x iterations, then it's never going to run off to infinity, so color that cell black as a part of the Mandelbrot set. But if it starts to run off, getting higher and higher, can you assign it a different color based on the number's value after N iterations? ( those pixels being the Mandelbrot halo)
ok
I always wanted to play with NNs :D Maybe I should get back into some hobby coding at some point :P
It's called the Mandelbrot fractal. Back around '84-ish I think.. .Francois Mandelbrot rocked the math world ( well, it seemed to me at least :P ) with this idea of "fractional dimensions"... fractals.
Anyone know what the B stands for in Benoit B. Mandelbrot?

Sure! Explaining lockfiles in your TL;DR version would be too much, though, so…
It depends on your project. Django admin absolutely kills it on "enterprise" projects where you need UI but UI polish is not the most important thing.
Hey, I made a bunch of additions and edits. I want to show you what I have. Could you give me permission on GitLab to push a branch to the repository?

I never wanted to bother with parsing cli arguments. But this looks so easy. I will start to integrate that I to my own scripts.
Yeah using [`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) is a dream compared to trying to parse them on your own, I highly recommend it.
look msvcrt if you are on windows. if you are on linux, use getch.
Python packaging being a dumpster fire is hardly a controversial opinion. I've heard many prominent people in the Python community make it. It is, however, finally getting the attention it needs, and getting better rapidly.
&gt;You could skip that step by working directly on the image Isn't that exactly what is happening there?
It has little to do with python. It is system dependent. On linux, any script can run as a service with some cronjob [cronjob example with reboot](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-execute-cron-job-after-system-reboot/) &amp;#x200B; Some Linux distribution has specific and cleaner way of doing it: [https://tecadmin.net/setup-autorun-python-script-using-systemd/](https://tecadmin.net/setup-autorun-python-script-using-systemd/) &amp;#x200B; For windows, I dunno.
Ok, I reworded your PR, but I disagree on locking for applications. It happened to me in multiple instances where I had to install multiple applications in the same environment and having locked versions makes it impossible to do so. So, the rule in general is that when it's time to specify abstract dependencies in any circumstance (but _especially_ for libraries) you want, as you said, not too strict not too loose. The reason why this is mostly important in libraries is that libraries are the ones _most_ likely to share an environment with other packages, and therefore must deal with the uncertainty of what will be available. Applications less so, but it can still happen.
hey man, whats a mandelbrot? btw, that image looks cool!
I reworded it. Thanks.
I keep updating it, so refresh it once in a while as I collect more feedback.
By the way, which mobile do you have? my cellphone shows it properly. Safari on macos does not though. I am fixing that.
Still doesn't make sense. If you have data that needs to be read and parsed, formatted, and displayed in an exact way to multiple clients, then ether you do it once and server a lean page that uses little bandwdth, so you have many client pull all that data individually using tons of bandwidth, and then you need to have all the clients process that data and then find a way of displaying it identically, which might not be possible if the data changes too frequently.

Sure but if the data is dynamic and can't be predicted beforehand, now you have to render one page to every user according to their query. Too much work. You just hand them json data and let the browser render the stuff.
That's ok, but what I wanted to do it's to make the user only press 'Y', not type 'Y' and then press &lt;Enter&gt;.
In the example I was referring to all clients are the same screen, hardware etc. Anyway there's many ways to skin a cat and depending on the type of data a json would be great. I just wanted to give an example to prove against your original comment that the only reasons to render server side are "either he's an old horse who didn't keep up with the joneses, or he's someone who just discovered python and html and he wanted to play way more than recommended."
You can definitely implement fractals like these as shaders. I did that back in highschool, performed really well.

Sounds like you need machine learning, look at “learning to rank” algorithms”. RankSVM is particularly easy to implement and creates exactly the pairwise preference that you ask for. Provided you have suitable data on your customers that can be used to train, it defines a good ranking procedure.

wtf is this shit
I don’t see those “books” anywhere but that one site. The claimed $99 for each looks ludicrous. Each one is a very focused topic, and all those topics have many excellent free tutorials and cookbooks available in many places. [An O’Reilly book covering the same topics](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) is free on github. This is a scam.
I've done this in various projects. The simple motivation is reducing the amount of things to keep in working memory &amp; rapid prototyping being a lot easier. If there is a good argument that for a particular project the HTML files should be static; I can just pre-render them. Also &gt;serialize( &gt; &gt; \[ html, &gt; &gt;\[ style, CSS({"font-family":"**Arial**, Helvetica, **sans**\-**serif**"}) \], &gt; &gt;\[ body, "Hello World" \] \]) is a lot less annoying to type out than a bunch of closing brackets all over the place.
Where is the option to say all 3 tests are pointless and establish nearly zero competency?
One can use numba + numpy to speed up the computation to about 1\~2 seconds, see [https://github.com/neozhaoliang/pywonderland/blob/master/src/misc/mandelbrot.py](https://github.com/neozhaoliang/pywonderland/blob/master/src/misc/mandelbrot.py) &amp;#x200B; and you can also use glsl + python to create nice fractal images, see [https://github.com/neozhaoliang/pywonderland/tree/master/src/fractal3d](https://github.com/neozhaoliang/pywonderland/tree/master/src/fractal3d)
Ya, I didn't really see the point of this test, but I just wanted to help the guy out
Package manager coverage of development depencies is so patchy though; having very different workflows even on different Linux distros is a nightmare. A cross-platform langaue-specific dependency manager is much more consistent and effective. For globally installing python-based applications from pyPI, I recommend using pipx.
Or how about just use it for free
I literally implemented some serverside html stuff yesterday at work, I needed to import a list of values and have those values get inserted as `&lt;option&gt;value&lt;/option&gt;` and there was like 50 of them and they can change at any time so they have to be dynamically created, and I don't want that sort of code sitting on the client side. I thought it was genius and dont see anything wrong with it considering one is being generated by possibly a powerful server using python and the other isn't starting until the client side is loaded and is being generated with javascript in a browser.
wrong. the gitpython module.
seems like the system is working if it keeps those like GP out. What would they have contributed anyway? &amp;#x200B; is there anyway to auto block someone from posting who isn't subscribed to this sub or only has been for minutes? or restrict by their karma or something? seems like that would at least cut down on the low value fly by's which seem to be the bulk of the annoying questions.

Assuming hierarchical inheritance, you'd have to load every class that comes before the mammal class. That's what I mean by taking the whole jungle. And that's a pain in the ass. That's also why I think OOP is a stupid concept in general. Of course singleton classes are unwanted. Not arguing with you on that. Also not saying that classes should be used as data storage. But attributes belonging to classes are essentially "data storage" in that they contain information about the object.
tell him the difference of front and back-end, so he doesnt wonder that programming and getting, for example, calculated results (oh wow it can multiply a number i type in by 3) doesnt look nice at first. second, think of fascinating applications or examples - a dice game that will play on its own and prints the reults?!

Hi, &amp;#x200B; \#1. you might get better answers on /r/learnpython \#2. you didnt say which line number you were getting the error on which kind of handicaps anyone that might be willing to answer your question. &amp;#x200B; assuming the error is in the \`main\` method, have you tried just passing \`player\` as an argument? just like you do in your \`check\_result\` method and \`summary\` method. or adding \`global player\` to your \`main\` method before it's referenced later just like you do in \`take\_player\`. &amp;#x200B; finally, after you get it working, I would suggest writing it in a different way to avoid using global variables. if you can manage it I think you will find that the version without globals is easier to understand and thus easier to fix problems when they come up. &amp;#x200B; Good luck.

ML is in my opinion a long term high growth field so it’s more important you understand how the engine works and less that you can drift using tensor flow. Python... yes! C yes Sql yes .net... hell no Scala is still a good language So is R! Most of us in the data Science community use macs as the hardware and software is far more stable and much more configurable. I don’t want to have to go re-learn everything because the existing data scientists are using Macs so I discovered this and copied them

I'm 16 and I've been learning Python intermittently for about a year. My favorite part of learning in the beginning was the problem solving and I mostly used hackerrank and project euler to do math/stats problems and that helped me a ton in getting used to the thinking/mindset required for programming. Try to work through some problems and ask lots of questions while giving him lots of chances to ask questions and learn as well. Once I became used to the basics, the thing that really hooked me was finding applications for it, like in my classes. Maybe try to work with him to figure out something he can use it for school, like a science fair or something.
This is really cool. I've been meaning I give prompt toolkit a try, so I'm glad to hear you had a good experience with it!
Yes I could have. I wanted something more simpler though to update the code. The main purpose for this script was for micropython which I'm working on converting over, which will update and do a reset on the boards. I just did it in python first.

The GitPython module is what i was referring to. It would of dropped this down to like 5 lines of logical code. 🤷🏼‍♂️
Thanks! You should, they have some nice examples in the repository to get started, you can do quite a lot with it!
Read the file line-by-line or a fixed amount of bytes and scan for a new line character. File handle has `read()` and `readlines()` methods. You can find details in the documentation.
AFAIK, list comprehensions are not statements like loops. Statements and Expressions in programming language are different. Basically, if you can pass something to a function then it is expression because a expression evaluates to a value unlike statements. You can’t pass a if statement inside a function because it doesn’t evaluates it just performs some action. Also, list comprehensions are optimized to be as fast if not faster than loops but with added benefits of getting to pass it, avoid too many appends and unnecessary variables that are usually required in loop statement. Also, it’s readable and list comprehensions can be a intro to generators which are really cool. I would search about “expression oriented programming “ or functional programming.
 f = open("demofile.txt", "r") for x in f: if (len(x) &gt; 50): print(x)
Because learning a new language would take quite a bit for me. I’m mostly comfortable w/ Python.
Link to the project?
If "large" still largely inferior to available RAM: with open(path) as f: lines = filter(lambda e:some_conditions(e), f.readlines()) for line in lines: do_something_you_want_with_your_line(line) If "large" is largely superior to available RAM: with open(path) as f: lines = filter(lambda e:some_conditions(e), f) for line in lines: do_something_you_want_with_your_line(line) The first solution will load the content splited into lines within memory and then process it. The second solutions process lines in streaming. In the later the amount of ram used is very low but require a lot of sequential read which are slower than a block read.
1) Ask in /r/learnpython 2) You can't just multiply two functions together, this has nothing to do with scipy as the call is failing at the `f1 * f2` step before scipy even sees it. You need to make a new function that does what you want, e.g. lambda x: f1(x) * f2(x)`.
Fair enough, if it's a big step then stick with what you know. It's always good to have more skills in your toolbox though.
You should be able to do something like this: need = [] with open("C:/path/to/file.txt", "r") as f: for line in f: if "test" in line and len(line) &gt; 10: need.append(line.rstrip("\n")) # print list of lines meeting criteria if desired print(need) # or just print out first 10 instances print(need[:10]) You just need to change the file name and the `if` condition. In this example, it loops through each line in a text file, checks if the word "test" appears and if the line has more than 10 characters. If so, it adds that line to the list, `need`. The `rstrip` will take care of getting rid of the newline ("\\n") character that may appear on each line.
Thanks, but since you answered... I admit that my problem is more complicated than what I indicated. The functions are actually an array of functions, so my product isn't as simple as creating a new function that multiplies the two. I'd need indices as arguments, where I'm iterating over all the indices and integrating the product of two particular functions to fill a matrix. For example, matrix entry i, j is the integral of f[i]*f[j] where i and j are the indices to be iterated over.
Thank You for your feedback I tried passing arguments and it did not work I'll post it on r/learnpython with line number of error.
Thanks a lot for the feedback!
Week you are right, but I felt it's kinda out of scope, especially when beginners just need to know the syntax and how to use it.

How can I add multiple variables? For example, if I want it to extract all lines that start with "Da", contain "Beep", and are 15 characters long, how would that look?
# [HIRING] CHIME Software Developer Position in Physics &amp; Astronomy Department, UBC, Vancouver Apply on [https://www.hr.ubc.ca/careers-postings/staff-s.php](https://www.hr.ubc.ca/careers-postings/staff-s.php) **Job Posting** **Job ID:** 33949 **Location:** Vancouver - Point Grey Campus **Employment Group:** Management&amp;Professional (AAPS) **Job Category:** Information Systems &amp; Tech **Classification Title:** Info.Sytems&amp;Technlgy, Level B **Business Title:** Software Developer **Department:** Physics &amp; Astronomy **Salary:** $61,840.00 - $89,085.00 (Annual) **Full/Part Time:** Full-Time **Desired Start Date:** 2019/07/14 **Job End Date:** 2021/07/14 **Funding Type:** Grant Funded **Closing Date:** 2019/06/12 Guiding principle: "Midpoint" of the hiring salary range means the individual possesses full job knowledge, qualifications and experience. ## Job Summary This successful applicant will work with remote and on-site members of the CHIME team as a programmer leading the development and automation of an HPC-based data acquisition and processing system for the CHIME radio telescope, operating 24/7 and located in the Okanagan Valley. This includes: - Traditional cluster-based scientific computing. Our pipeline is mostly Python with the heavy lifting done in C or in numerical libraries (e.g. LAPACK) - Management systems, e.g. tracking and moving data around (custom Python); keep tracking of the telescope configuration (Python+MySQL backend, PHP frontend); monitoring the telescope status (Prometheus and Grafana). - High throughput streaming systems. This is the onsite real-time processing side and is almost entirely C++ based. Where exactly the developer spends their time will be determined by their strengths, interests and where the most pressing needs are for the project, but a successful candidate will touch all of the above at some point. Tasks will include consulting with users, scientists and engineers to determine requirements and specifications for data processing and storage, also the design, development, installation, deployment, testing and maintenance of the software, and providing support to understand and operate the system. CHIME ([chime-experiment.ca](http://chime-experiment.ca/)) is an exciting, cutting-edge experiment, and we are looking for a skilled developer who is enthusiastic about science to strengthen our software team. ## Organizational Status Reports to the UBC Investigators of the CHIME Project (Faculty, Professor) and to the Project Manager of the CHIME Project. Also interacts with scientific staff and programmers on the CHIME project at UBC, McGill University, University of Toronto and the Dominion Radio Astronomical Observatory. The work environment is a Physics lab: a friendly and informal environment, with flexible working hours. The team consists of skilled developers (staff and postdoctoral scientists with a heavy software leaning), and physics graduate students, whom the new developer would help mentor. ## Work Performed CHIME will generate ~6 TB of data per second. The data must be mined in real time for calibration and flagging purposes, and reduced, for storage, to a more manageable size. The successful applicant will: - Maintain a development environment on a heterogeneous cluster used for scientific data analysis - Work on automation of application deployment and configuration management (ansible) - Maintain and enhance existing data-quality monitoring framework for the overall operation of the telescope - Design and develop testing and documentation procedures. - Develop procedures and methods for transfer of data from remote, and bandwidth limited site, to Compute Canada. - Participate in weekly meetings to provide updates on project. - Design, develop, install and maintain systems for remote control and monitoring of the HPC system and its associated infrastructure using web and mobile-based platforms. ## Supervision Received Much of the work will be performed in a team environment. Overall supervision will come from the UBC faculty members and the Project Manager (a UBC Scientific Engineer). The employee will also be expected to interact constructively with his/her counterparts at UBC, McGill University and the University of Toronto and the Dominion Radio Astronomical Observatory. ## Supervision Given The applicant will not directly supervise anyone, though will need to work with UBC CHIME research group members at all levels, and is expected to offer minor training to other members of the team. ## Consequence of Error/Judgement Good technical judgement by the candidate will result in a well-maintained easy-to-use instrument tuned to its scientific purpose. Good design decisions will result in well-written code, with clear software implementation of algorithms, which is easy to test, enhance and maintain Poor judgement can result in damage, lost observing time and sensitivity, delays and reduced productivity for the entire collaboration. ## Qualifications Undergraduate degree in a relevant discipline. - An undergrad degree in Computer Science or Computer Engineering preferred with two years of relevant experience. Alternatively, a degree in Physics and Astronomy with strong knowledge of computer programming and few years of relevant experience. - In depth understanding of Unix/Linux operating systems (essential) - In depth experience with Python (essential) - In depth experience with a strongly-typed compiled language is a requirement. C++ is preferred. - Ability to work in a fast changing environment and to learn new tools and applications quickly and independently. - Strong problem solving skills and attention to detail. - Database and web-based programming [bonus]. - Experience with concurrent programming, in particular to run large scientific calculations - Experience in troubleshooting operational anomalies in HPC systems is an asset. - Good team player with strong focus on delivering results to meet the scientific needs. - Self-motivated and demonstrated ability to work on different projects concurrently and to manage deadlines. - Excellent communication, organizational, and interpersonal skills in English (spoken and written).

Apologies for the verbosity. HR says I'm not allowed to change the wording!
Excellent, Thanks. I had not explicitly considered that side of it.
\` target.write(line1+"\\n"+line2+"\\n"+line3)\`
You want to concatenate the strings. Sorry for the formatting; I'm on a phone and don't know how to do it right but: Target.write(Line1 + "\n" + line2 + "\n" + line3) Give that a whack.
The answer to number 3 would be hourly
I think we will see in my lifetime a backlash against single page apps as the default. It's gotten so bad now that throwing a new website up(which used to be a matter of ftping a file to the server) now requires react boiler plate a build process, a docker image on the size of at least megabytes. And weeks of effort instead of minutes. Eventually some manager is going to wake up to the amount of money wasted, go back to server side rendering with minimal Js and it will be a competitive advantage, and we will all follow suit. I can't wait.
Strings are treated as lists just add them line1+"\n"+...
Well said. On the topic of factories, I use them all the time in python, but they are usually just functions. Fwiw

Another possibility is that better tooling for single-page apps will be developed and become sufficiently widespread that the WW3 bakes it into the next HTML standard and simplifies the whole thing. Since we have websockets now, it's conceivable in principle to do things like this: `Stock price is: &lt;dynamic id='foo' src='/bar'/&gt;` where the &lt;dynamic&gt; tag is equivalent to a label which updates its content whenever the server signals a change in '/bar'. Or, how about a dynamic tag that supports switch-cases: &lt;switch id='foo' src='/stockval'&gt; &lt;case 'is_null'&gt; Stock value is not defined. &lt;/case&gt; &lt;case 'is_float'&gt; Stock value is &lt;dynamic src='/stockval' /&gt; &lt;/case&gt; &lt;case 'any'&gt; This should never happen. Please refresh the page or contact the administrator. &lt;/case&gt; &lt;/dynamic&gt; There are probably good criticisms you can make of doing things this way ( for one, maybe string-names for case predicates is not a good idea ) but I think this more or less illustrates the point. BTW being able to write abstractions and encode them as customized tags is one of the other good reasons for doing "in source" page rendering, since you don't have to wait for the WW3 to come up with a tag that does what you want.
Does anyone know the color scheme used for this picture?
We'll be setting up channels for each participating team in the server, where you'll be able to communicate with your team members before the jam starts.
Hi James, thank for your reply! I also had this idea if row[b] &lt;= row[end] or row[b] == row[end] and coo_A.col[b] &lt;= coo_A.col[end]: But it is not working correctly. See below: (5, 4) 6.66666667 (5, 5) -16809.6667 (5, 6) 3.33333333 (6, 5) 6.66666667 (6, 6) -16809.6667 (6, 7) 3.33333333 (1, 9) 91.4285714 There are multiple failures as e.g. (1,9).

I'm glad you liked the podcast! It was a lot of fun to do. &amp;#x200B; As far as Win32 com, I have not done much else with it. It's definitely powerful but I tend to stick to small tasks like emailing files and relatively simple manipulations. &amp;#x200B; I do think it is interesting that there is not much out there outside of stack overflow snippets here and there. I'm not really sure why more people don't experiment with it.
It sounds like what you're taking about is hiring a software architect. That's certainly a thing, but I wouldn't recommend it. They generally charge more than a software developer (expect to pay $700 a day), there's a very real danger you'll end up with an overengineered solution, and whilst you may not want them to write the code for you, the best ones will typically want to produce a prototype as part of their process. If you've got money to hire an experienced developer, you might be better off hiring them as more of a mentor. Many contract developers will be used to working in this way - it's fairly common for contracts to include upskilling the client's existing staff.
For this qualifier, there's no need to use modules outside of the standard library. You can use any stdlib module as part of your solution, though.
Of course use a fresh account oven an vpn connection using a new email.

OpenGL and WebGL are _precisely_ for per pixel drawing - they're rasterization API's. Write a shader to compute the fractal, and it will perform way better than anything else - if you want performant graphics code, you're going to want to write shaders in any case. Not sure why using OpenGL would be painful in python either - for something like this, you're just loading your shader program into the GL context and updating a uniform for the position.
I think that’s a very important aspect. One that an experienced coder might sometimes forget about. I also thought about creating some kind of a game, but there‘s only three weeks to go from zero to an at least mostly finished game.
Thanks for your perspective. I will have to find out if he’s as enthusiastic for solving math problems as you are. I am very much for the learning by doing way. I have experience with Codecademy but not with Hackerrank. The earlier I found sometimes a little exhausting.
 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice\_10000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_10000) what about that one? i also wanted to do this as a training. like roll 6 dice, print the results, take some out, roll the remaining dice, print the results, .. the fun should be the programming part, not to create a game that is actual playable

I'm glad you think so. Our experience is that a lot of people interested in data science are not even aware that online machine learning is a thing!

Do you have a link to the source code?
Try solving some of the project euler problems.[Even Fibonacci numbers](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2) or [Longest Collatz sequence](https://projecteuler.net/problem=14) should be a good start. Monte Carlo simulation are also fun way to get better understandings of things such as the probability of sum of two dice or how many packs Magic cards you need to buy to complete a set. I've also done simple particle simulations and visualizing them in pygame. Creating various playing card games in the console is also something you can try, black jack should be fairly straight forward.
Don't pretend that us, league players, are smart. We play that game dude. Duh.
It's still black fucking magic to me how something like this can from such a simple formula.
Lucky bastard, I want an internship too... On the subject, I practiced Java and Python on https://codingbat.com/java, it could provide some useful examples for you to try, as well as monitor how well he's doing. Good luck.
You could potentially put all of those conditions in the same `if` statement. So your `if` statement would look more like this: if "Da" in line and "Beep" in line and len(line) == 15: If you need multiple conditions to apply, you just need to separate each condition by `and`.

I don't... want to, it ruins the joke :( maybe it was a bad one.
The second method is very likely to be superior; Python does its own buffering of files, so it's not like you're only reading a single line at a time from disk.

Yea so I can import the nmap library, but it gives way to much info/output. I literally only need my output to be.... Hostname1 - 192.168.1.x
"image" is just an array of data in the above code, initialized with all 1s. It needs to be converted to an image to be viewed.
At the moment the average converges to just under 4 minutes, which is not as low as I would like it to be. I believe we should be able to go under the 2 minutes mark. The algorithm only uses 5 features, and there is **a lot** room for improvement.
You simply filter out what you don't need. Rarely is data delivered in the exact format you desire unless you call on it as such. Grab what you need, chuck the rest.
Imo you really need to be comfortable with solving for any situation. Once you feel you have reached that point, you can do anything.

**IEEE 754** The IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic (IEEE 754) is a technical standard for floating-point arithmetic established in 1985 by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The standard addressed many problems found in the diverse floating-point implementations that made them difficult to use reliably and portably. Many hardware floating-point units use the IEEE 754 standard. The standard defines: arithmetic formats: sets of binary and decimal floating-point data, which consist of finite numbers (including signed zeros and subnormal numbers), infinities, and special "not a number" values (NaNs) interchange formats: encodings (bit strings) that may be used to exchange floating-point data in an efficient and compact form rounding rules: properties to be satisfied when rounding numbers during arithmetic and conversions operations: arithmetic and other operations (such as trigonometric functions) on arithmetic formats exception handling: indications of exceptional conditions (such as division by zero, overflow, etc.)The current version, IEEE 754-2008 revision published in August 2008, includes nearly all of the original IEEE 754-1985 standard plus IEEE 854-1987 Standard for Radix-Independent Floating-Point Arithmetic. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Python uses [banker's rounding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Round_half_to_even). Sometimes .5 rounds up, sometimes it rounds down.
There is buffering on system level as well but it is still slower than loading everything by big batch I think. I will do some benchmarks tomorrows eventually

What are you using to learn? I'm teaching myself as well and in using head first learn to code and head first python
This worked, thank you!
I tried what you guys recommended, thank you!
Considering it just told me my game was going to be 3 hours long, I feel like it's not so accurate at the minute...
Cool. Thanks for replying
Use a package called Faust to implement your data pipeline as it streams in. Use a package called FastAPI to build your real-time website.
What is League of Legends?
I just checked. There was a bug related to timezones, it should be fixed now :)
Man I was going to do something similar, but forecasting the probability of an outcome (win/loss) of a match with given champions (dataset is on kaggle). But I wasn't sure which approach to take since it's categorical data ranging from like 1 to 00 (amount of champions, not sure how many right now), and doing onehot encoding would result in quite larg lists, etc. Do you know which approach to take there? Basically it's the same idea as yours, just that it should predict win/loss. You can PM me if you don't want to make it public. Was trying to use the Riot API too and managed to do a simple request. I'm quite a beginner btw. but have a very basic understanding of machine learning.

Awesome. Congrats.

I've been working on a Jarvis project for a while, and I've used pocketsphinx for recognizing the keyword "Jarvis", the SpeechRecognition library for recognizing and converting speech to text, and chatterbot trained with a custom corpus for responses from the program. It works pretty well, but of course it can only respond using the pre trained sentences. I've been thinking about trying to implement some kind of Markov chain to get some variation, but I haven't really gotten into that yet.

check MicroPython, can be run on low powered boards, like esp32.
You could use Pandoc to convert it to a more manageable format
You should at something called "factorization machines", it's exactly meant for this kind of problem. I'm storing the winner of each match along with the duration, so maybe I'll give it a shot further down the line. Feel free to check out the code, it's all open-source :)
I really like studying the concepts under the hood in depth, so it took me a little bit more than four days to study all the way from face detection to recognition. Nice journey!
Thank you very much :)
Neat. The response time seems very slow, though. Two things I think might be contributing to that: * The script opens the log file every iteration of the while loop. * The script finds all instances of matches to the regex on every iteration. This means it's scanning data that was already checked by the previous iteration, which is not necessary. I'd recommend this code snippet for how to "infinitely" process a log file (i.e. "tail -f file.log"): https://github.com/dabeaz/generators/blob/master/examples/follow.py
What I need is like a Siri or Alexa in real world experiences.
As someone that has on occasion had a go at being a dirty two-timer, I approve. I had a go couple years ago at making a real-time combat log parser for WoW, that could be used to implement features that the in-game client API doesn't allow for. It was doable, but we got past the content that I was annoyed by, so I stopped working on it.
Right, they need to be strings or you need to use string formatting instead of concatenation. I don't really know enough about your data set to write the code for you.
Oh boy, I'll definitely look into the term and the source code! Yeah man it would be super interesting if you would do that.
You can if you install it to a directory that doesn’t overwrite the OS installation of python3. You’ll need some libraries first but something like this: sudo apt install libarchive-dev libbz2-dev liblzma-dev libghc-zlib-dev tcl-snack-dev libreadline-dev libssl-dev libffi-dev libuuid1 libsqlite3-dev libgdbm-dev uuid-dev libghc-uuid-dev tk tk-dev libgdbm-dev libgdbm-compat-dev gdbm-l10n tk8.6-dev wget -O Python-3.7.3.tgz "https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.3/Python-3.7.3.tgz" tar -zxvf Python-3.7.3.tgz cd Python-3.7.3 ./configure --enable-loadable-sqlite-extensions --prefix=/hole/username/python373 --enable-optimizations make make install Note: on mobile so formatting may suck.
Note that you can get the current user's documents folder would having them manually edit the file. Use `os.path.expanduser('~/Documents/...')`
Yeah.. that really isn't an easy thing to do if you have the expectations of it working as good as the big company AIs. You should probably try to break down the task into pieces, and do some googling. Also, you would probaly get more good answers if you asked in r/learnpython
Sounds fun, I’d assume you’ll would have to learn to use github.
Consultants count on people not knowing for their income. Google-fu is a skill all to itself.
What OP will you be running? As that can highly affect ur battery life, if you're running a linux distro like ubuntu then go for the lenovo imo
I like that—I’ll remember this.
Project management isn't a language boundary. All you need is the ability to make in code comments. Management's comes with tools on top. Check out github, slack and trello.
Do you mind explaining a bit more the architecture? Are you using ReactJS or something like that or just good old Django?
[This](https://www.google.com/)
That just links to google?
Python is definitely a language in which you can do group projects. If you do, do group projects you might want to use git for version control then use either Github or Gitlab to create repositories from where you can easily manage the files.
Exactly
You can use embedding, which projects vectors into lower dimensions + neural nets. With Keras, you can feed dense classes into the embedding layer and it will use them to index learned representations and feed them into further layers. But it is probably too tricky for a beginner.
You are in school but also a csa at a SOC?
Correct!! I'm 32 but never went to college....my hobby since I got out of high school was computers. I started spending 8-10 hours a day dicking around with networks, hacking, etc...Kali Linux was my main OS for a few years. I taught myself enough over the course of 10 years to get a job in the SOC of a data center without a single college credit. So I make enough money now to put myself through college.
So wait... you use Kali and complain about nmap giving you too much info? No offense, I’m sure you are great at it, just so strange.
I'm not complaining about the volume of output nmap provides, I'm saying I dont need it for this specific project, and moreso cant have it in my output for this specific program. The output can only be formatted like I posted in my question.... Hostname1 - 192.168.1.x
Regex dude. You can filter for what you need. This should be something easily accomplishable in a few functions and less than like 100 lines.
Oof. I am not sure if 2.7 allows it but formatted strings are what make the most since. 3.x's `f" some {string}"` syntax doesn't work here but the following shooould: `"{}\n{}\n{}".format(line1,line2,line3)`
I completely agree, and I apologize if I seemed hostile, that's my bad man. I should have been more specific, my class started 2 weeks ago so I dont know Jack shit about Python yet really. But I get what you are saying. So you suggest I import the nmap library, run the correct scan, and filter out the text I dont need using regex? Then I am only left with hostname and associated IP address.
Yep. Use the re library and the nmap one and whichever others you need. If you need to look up some regex tutorials and the re libraries documentation, it's a standard one. I don't believe nmap is.
That's awesome, I just needed something to run with, thanks brother!!
you should update your terminal to have a Pip boy style for maximum effect.
Is this a shitpost?
Hi, I loved the concept of using the logs to make game assistants but I don't quite get what is happening in the clip (never played fallout). What else is possible to get from the logs?
Fantastic!
The script is pulling the current cell occupied area, and seeing if that cell has a related https://fallout.fandom.com page. If it does, then the script pulls the "Notable loot" section from its page, and prints out all of the notable loot. There's a bunch of other stuff you can get from the log, if you want a general overview go check out its SKK Lag defector. I linked it in one of my other comments (can't link now; I'm on my phone)
Is this a mod this greenery?

Very cool! Any tips on learning Django?
I updated my script so it's a lot faster, many thanks to all of the advice given!
You can view that numpy `image` array directly with import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.imshow(image) plt.show()
print('what ever you want to print')
Time to learn VCS! git is a good place to start.
Print keyword argument is no longer supported in Python 3. You may be reading a Python 2 guide and using Python 3.
so what do I replace it with?
It is.. I tried it out already and am really confused about it.. but I'll look further into it.. thanks!
Call the builtin print function instead. Basically, \`print 'something'\` becomes \`print('something')\`. Good luck.
I'm a fan of using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage python versions, since it handles all the building for me.
Google metaclasses.
It's just a regular function now. You need parenthesis around the argument(s). That's assuming you're using Python 3. Otherwise my guess would be the indentation on that line is wrong (tabs vs spaces accidentally).

Just pass the function to your decorator directly. So just do something like decorated = my_decorator(subprocess.call(['ls', '-a'])) Then calling `decorated` will invoke the now decorated function.
I'm assuming the path to `cells.json` is for the one we're seeing in the repo. If it's always going to be in the same directory as the script, have you considered using a relative path instead? Minor change, but it would be convenient. BTW, this is super neat, and I love the use of the game's logs. At first I was thinking it was some CV stuff, but this was much better lol
Do you plan to share any code?
Thanks for the compliment! Yeah, I just sorta forgot about the hard code to `cells.json`. Just changed it, thanks for the heads up
Great for you, really. But you do realize that this is a single bash function (to avoid the /tmp/ destination on scp) plus simply using a ssh config file? I mean ssh $target isn't that many keystrokes neither is scp $file $target:/tmp/ but I do get that an alias that saves you the :/tmp may ve useful for you
thanks!
Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for and it's now such an obvious solution when you consider what a decorator actually is. Thank you!
I"ve been doing python development for about 3.5 years but never with anyone else. I'd enjoy working with others as i never get to do that at my job. What kind of projects do you guys work on? i'm more data science and not so much web dev.

Does this fulfill all the optional dependencies? Last time I tried compiling, dependencies were like wack a mole and I gave up
You tried hacking an online game? And succeed?

Very cool, but upgrading from 2 to 3 never goes that smoothly.

umm its just print('hello world') isnt it? Not sure why you broke it up there.
Thank you for sharing this. I've never seen this but it is so much of what I need.
Also, it’s nice to include the actual error when you ask for help. That way we don’t have to guess what it is. :)

1. /r/learnpython 2. Use a dictionary.
The client writes the log to disk if so requested. There's a bit of latency involved where the log file only gets written to when there's enough events to make it worthwhile (a buffer gets full I presume), but it turned out that having 20 players doing their thing caused the buffer to fill up constantly, so the latency was minimal.
This is by far the simplest way, OP.
TL'DR: Your method of searching is fine. There is better way but this is likely not gonna be the least efficient part of your code so I won't worry about it. If you have a Book instance and you just want to locate it in a list, you can take a look at index(). However, it seems that you want to probe your list with a key word which should match an attribute of a list item. In this case there isn't a built-in way to do it, at least to my knowledge. But your search method is linear to size of input, which isn't bad. Binary search is faster but it requires your list being sorted (whatever that means to your Book class). Sorting a list creates additional complexity (and is almost always worse than searching) so unless you expect to do a lot of searches, it won't be worth implementing a sorting and a binary search methods.

That's not right. There's not nearly enough screeching or screaming
That's a good option and wouldn't be too hard to code. Thanks for the idea!
U explain with such clarity... It's awesome... Keep posting more stuff
If I switched to a dictionary could the values be a list of another class as long as my keyword is a single word that is unique? I was thinking about doing a dictionary but I figured a list of a class would be easier to use throughout the program. This was just a simple example of what I’m attempting to do. I actually have a name and a list of variables. It’s hard to explain what I’m exactly doing but I figure the logic behind it all is very similar.
My bad it’s late and thought I was in /r/learnpython
Yes, I can highly recommend both glumpy and vispy for exactly this sort of thing. They provide a nice, OO interface to easily get setup with OpenGL.
Can you send us an example?
That’s nice

Maybe they snake imported `six` `six` `six` before upgrading?
nah, a lot of people find /r/ crosspost confusing. There is no way to see on old.reddit.com were the repost is coming from except following the link.
Until the snake realise he cannont compile cpython3 on his fav linux distro...
Apparently upgrading from 2.7 to 3.x is both frightening and disturbing. Actually, that sounds about right.
```python def add(a,b): return a+b async def sub(a,b): return a-b ``` what is the problem with that

You can also do make altinstall instead of —prefix
Thank you, anti-gif-bot
Did the error message say “SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'” or did it just say “SyntaxError” If you didn’t see the full message, you should spend some time figuring out what in your development environment is hiding it.
may as well do print('h','e','l','l',o',' ','w','o','r','l','d') cause it works right? What's your point?

This gif always amazes me, none of the snakes I hate met would let you anywhere near them when shedding. Even the most friendly of them will strike when shedding.
Good plan. Connect Python to the web using django?
You could move to an async framework if you're IO bound, but if your script is doing a ton of calculations then moving it out to Celery would be my recommendation. Just know that Celery adds a lot of complexity to your project.
I tried an older version and it wasnt ready for anything serious. Hopefully this is usable for serious work.
Excellent.
Pycharm by jetbrains is one of best IDE for python and is also good as per your need of refactoring. It's just wonderful and has free community version.
I'd highly recommend that once you start getting a little more experienced, you try finding an open source package that you like (on github or similar) and start trying to fix issues. Look for "good first issue" labels, as these are labelled to be easy for newcomers. They will still be hard for you, but they're doable.
Put it on path. Yes, they don't recommend this, but you're still allowed to do so. I did so when I did a clean reinstall yesterday.
It seems like you're saying that in your arrays, there are some indices that have the value None. I assume that this is already the case for your raw data. I would create a mask showing all Nans with `mask = np.isnan(arr)` and then set all the Nans to zero with `arr[mask] = 0`. Loop that across all your arrays, and then just add them together.
Yes, we do.
It's just good old Django, the point of the project is to serve as a simple example. You can check [these](https://maxhalford.github.io/slides/creme-pydata/#33) slides out for more information, they're from a presentation I gave at PyData.
Nope, no JavaScript, I wanted to keep this as simple as possible. To be honest I think Django's official documentation is the best, you should definitely start from [there](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/)!
This looks like a variant of the [Knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem). That wikipedia article might be of help to you.
**Knapsack problem** The knapsack problem or rucksack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items. The problem often arises in resource allocation where there are financial constraints and is studied in fields such as combinatorics, computer science, complexity theory, cryptography, applied mathematics, and daily fantasy sports. The knapsack problem has been studied for more than a century, with early works dating as far back as 1897. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

I think you’ve severely misunderstood the point of the subreddit
1. /r/learnpython 2. What you're trying to do is really five distinct problems - first, you need to recognize the words that the user is saying from the raw sound stream, then you need to extract semantic meaning from those words to figure out what the user is actually asking, then you need to figure out how to handle the user's query, then you need to build a natural sounding response as text, and then you need to convert those words into speech. Pretty much none of those problems are solved to a level where I can just say "use X thing and everything will Just Work", and most of them involve lots of machine learning.
Yeah right let's all pretend that's not just someone jerking a dragon
Suppose I build a simple voice assistant like jarvis .it could speak..now I want to import chatbot so that my jarvis can speak as it wants (but not going to Deep learning).now can I make my chatbot speak like jarvis?can u show some demo code chatbot speaking(NOT going from machine learning).
You can't really do speech synthesis without deep learning. You can take a library that does it for you, but it will probably involve deep learning at some point. The same goes for speech recognition.
can u provide me some demo code or tutorial that the simple chatbot built from python later turn to speak(voice assistant)..any link bro?
Just note that because of Python's dynamic nature, there are some things that no ide can ever do. That means that refactoring may often be incomplete or inaccurate, so always double check the result. Same with "find all usages", i prefer trusting global search more when dealing with large codebases
There is no "tutorial" because what you're asking for is extremely task specific and extremely non-trivial.
https://youtu.be/jDsmymypNdo can u look into the output and some code.Here is the demo..I think he is not using deep learning.but he is importing chatbot.
Short term solution would be to add `threaded=True` to your `app.run()` call. This'll launch a new thread for each request.
should he be doing that, helping the snake peel of its skin? isnt that bad for the snake, kinda like with the whole butterfly thing where if you help it get out of the cocoon then it'd make it weaker and die early?
Well I did ask because I wasn't sure. but it's deleted now. meh :P
I'm super impressed by the case and the execution of this :) Well done!
Probably not the same for snakes.

Read Fluent Python or Serious Python.
Yes I did realize that it was pretty much acting as a bash alias, but I really did find it to be useful to simply type \`vm\` or \`vm -e "command..."\` or \`vm -s file\` all very quickly. I am sure you can write this in bash with aliases but I just wrote it in python to not have to think much about it whilst writing it.

Cool congrats 👌.. Don't stop and keep contributing whenever you can 👍
(another user who never plays fallout) I have a suggestion: caching. Store the data that it has received offline for later use. Should make it faster, and Lowers the change of getting banned/tempbanned from the fandom.

Nice.
I would say it’s personal preference. Doing a project someone suggests is no better than doing tutorials or examples. You need to find a problem you have, and then solve it. That’s gonna be the only way!
Yeah ok I can see that, thanks
Thanks for the suggestion, but I'm working with an existing project. The site was originally designed for only 1 client only, so using synchronous functions was no problem. But now we have extended the app's capabilities to handle more than 1 user with only the same server, so I guess I need to move the synchronous function to a task queue. Is celery the only way to go now?
No, the comma adds a space
If i understand this correctly, every time a user accesses a URL, it will trigger the associated function on a separate thread?
Nope. print("hello", "world) Would have an out of hello world
Yes, a mentor will fit perfectly. Considering that I'm in third world country, the cost of development is kind of limited.
https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/0.15.x/serving/#werkzeug.serving.run_simple Every request will be handled in a separate thread.
think about “problems“ that you want to solve. or dice games you like to play
i will use autocad and civil 3d not fully supported by linux ( support some version with low feature) windows only so go for what
looks like monokai to me
https://youtu.be/jDsmymypNdo is it from machine learning.?
Make a game. The list of problems you have and the list of problems that are solvable with Python have a intersection of null sometimes.

Chatterbot is machine learning based, I'm pretty sure the program in the youtube video is as well
This also had been my impression. Hence, my question. Still hoped there is an IDE out there dealing with it a bit better.
Also, it's made in python.
Really it boils down to you writing organised code, using type annotations (like mypy and others) extensively, and checking them as part of your test suite all the time. With these kinds of techniques the ide has more information to work with, and the more information it has the better it can do its job.
That must feel good
&gt; I suspect this is because nobody expects serialization to be slow. Lol, anyone who has ever worked with rest endpoints at scale should know how abysmally slow serialization can be ESPECIALLY for JSON.
Great stuff! This itself is a good guide, specially around Github! Keep up the great work and sharing knowledge back with us.
Discord link not working for me. (iOS, mobile Reddit)
Yeah but by letting the client do it, I can externalize cost for free and make my server really lean. Fuck those people on mobile connections, they gotta download all my Javascript.
https://discord.gg/phGFchn
Clone popular websites and apps. 😀
Why thank you.
Np 😅, I’ll be called Fwiz on that server
But now each client is doing the work instead. I call it being a dick and externalizing costs of rendering onto potentially power constrained devices running on a tiny battery... As compared to your 10+ core server &amp;#x200B; We still do it now and we serve 12 million impressions per day with a single server. It's not impossible
WingIDE: it’s a lot faster than PyCharm, but has a few less features. I have an i7 with an SSD and plenty of RAM and PyCharm is painfully slow. It needs to run well.
Also possibly on a power constrained dinky mobile phone that needs every MAh of battery power to spare
Much better today alright, \~26 min estimate. Which makes a lot more sense. &amp;#x200B; Would be interesting to know which side it's predicting to win (if it is at all?), although maybe that could be given with the post-match stats of estimated vs true duration.
Is it requiring people to use it to accumulate data or is it doing it by itself anyway? If it helps someone else out I'll gladly run it every game.
Try making a playing with fire game! Start working with grids in the terminal to get a good idea, then you can try to move to pyqt5, it will teach you threads, front end, backend, using/designing interfaces. Well a better recommendation is try and make a relatively simple game youd like to have to share and to be able to modify as you wish.
You can also do something like `subprocess.call = my_decorator(subprocesses.cali)` but not sure if this can lead to other things breaking.
Noob here, why isn't this the long term solution?
So? You can make pretty damned fast Python software. People who say things like this are usually noobs regurgitating something they heard a friend say
Meh, that's a lot of disk pollution just to avoid some http calls
Sounds like something is wrong with the installation or something. I've never experienced slowness in any of Jetbrains stuff. There's a couple tweaks you can do with startup parameters and stuff that might help.
How did you make this?
I’ve disabled probably 80% of the options. Startup is slow, but doesn’t happen often. It’s what I think is indexing while I’m working and the program freezes for a solid minute that annoys me. 10 minutes later, it’ll do it again.
Which part do you find strange?
Http requests take time. Parsing takes time, and CPU usage. When making automated requests you can get blocked by some fandoms.

Huh. Weird. I believe you can send a snapshot to Jetbrains if you really want to try to figure it out. I've never experienced anything like that.
Cool project. But many linux versions come with 'cheese' which is a nice camera tool that works with USB microscopes.
Python threading isn't great, and you'll probably want to either move to an eventloop model (for I/O bound operations) or a multiprocessing model (for CPU bound operations).

It's just a solution that doesn't scale well. With a small number of simultaneous users and giving every request from each user its own thread, things aren't too bad. As more users come on (say, 250+ simultaneous) and you've got that many threads going, then things will start slowing down real quick. Flask's built-in server wasn't designed to be used at that scale*. There is dedicated server software that can fill the role of distributing requests-&gt;threads much better, while still behaving like a Flask app (there's [a nice list](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/deploying/) of them on the flask site). If you're presenting a Flask app to the internet and you want it to handle traffic, then you'd use one of those servers to run your app. There *are* pure python techniques you can look at to prevent a single request from stopping the entire server, and this is really what OP should start with. It isn't acceptable for a request to be received but unanswered for 30 seconds. \*A Flask app is really only as fast as its slowest page. If the majority of the app is able to generate/return content in *milliseconds* (not waiting on slow things like IO or CPU heavy tasks) then Flask can handle much more traffic quite happily.
Can you please upload this again but with more wild camera swinging and dramatic zooms?
I'll ask the dumb question: What the heck is rice?
Are you still married after that?
Thanks :)
Haha yes :-)! She thought it was funny... but later on I tried to put it back on and then she said "I don't want to talk to the bot anymore" :D
&gt; source urban dictonary # rice Race Inspired Cosmetic Enhancements. (R.I.C.E.)Parts put on cars to make them look fast, when they have no internal tuning, and are actually slow as hell. Parts usually consist of excessivley angular bodykits, large rear spoilers, neon, sponsor stickers, chrome rims, fake "coffee can" exhaust tips, and loud, annoying paint jobs and/or vynils. Sometimes parts are do-it-yourself installed and are basically duct taped to the car. Most commonly known for being done to Honda Civics, but can also be done to slow domestic vehicles, such as a Chevy Cavalier, etc. "Yo dog, did you see the Civic that guy was rollin' in? it was so rice."

Codeabbey have a lot of fun challenges to help you with problem solving.
Very interesting project, I might have a closer look at the code and hopefully use it/contribute if I have time. &amp;#x200B; Cheers!
For future reference, it's easiest for other people to help you if you include all the relevant code as text and all the input and output, including a full traceback. Both should be in code blocks (in old reddit, that means adding 4 spaces before each line, in new reddit there's probably a button for that). If the code is too long, you can use a pastebin service like https://hastebin.com/ https://pastebin.com/ or https://gist.github.com/ For example: --- I'm trying to make a program that tells the user their age, but I get an error! from datetime import date def find_age(current_year, birth_year, after_birthday): if after_birthday: return current_year - birth_year else: return current_year - birth_yera - 1 birth_year = int(input('please enter the year you were born: ')) after_birthday = input('has it been your birthday yet this year? [y/N] ').lower() == 'y' current_year = date.today().year print('you are', find_age(current_year, birth_year, after_birthday), 'years old!') When I run it, I get this output please enter the year you were born: 1636 has it been your birthday yet this year? [y/N] n Traceback (most recent call last): File ".\example_error.py", line 13, in &lt;module&gt; print('you are', find_age(current_year, birth_year, after_birthday), 'years old!')

if you think the windows store is curated, you're in for a bad surprise.
Simple, to the point, and clear. Bookmarked.
Nice job but I really expected something better coming in. The bot just said almost total random sentences. Hopr you don't speak like that.
I understand that's what it might look like, but I checked the examples myself and they were very close to actual things she said and I replied to. &amp;#x200B; \`\`\`python \[2012-10-28T15:48:41.989000\] Teodora: because I have to be in church at 4 ... ... 21 messages ... ... \[2012-10-28T15:58:20.129000\] Pascal: you arrived? \[2012-10-28T15:58:25.767000\] Teodora: where? \[2012-10-28T15:58:31.917000\] Pascal: church \`\`\` &amp;#x200B; It's just that because it doesn't take time nor place into account, it seems odd - but it is definitely having low error and replying well to the utterances! &amp;#x200B; Also, the moment she gets confused with what the bot is saying is when the bot has to really improvise as she obviously never said: "I am not sure I can follow :(" in our 300k messages.
orbits in KSP be like
Hahaha yes!
Lame bot.
I had (and still do have) a lot of fun making authentication apps; these are great as they can be as simple as you want but when you learn new things then they can also be applyed to this kind of program. The basics of it are: creating an account; loging in; being able to edit/delete your account when loged in. But you can go however far you want with it as you learn more- encryption of account details, storage in external files, datebase handeling, creating a graphical user iterface etc.
Have you tried Scapy?
Hey! Always good to see that kind of stuff. Since you ask for feedback, I would suggest to improve documentation. Basic setting up seems covered. But it's not very clear what your software does? It's tools for tkinter ok so knowing what tkinter is, you can get an idea. But it's vague. What does it do exactly? Why do I want it? Features, screenshots, etc. Just my two cents.
Hello. Thanks for the answer, that really helped. But I was just wondering: if you can process requests in multiple threads, what's the advantage of task queues like celery over multi threaded requests?
Choco relies on a list maintained by the author or authors not the windows store

Python is not so much slower as to make a difference in 95% of usages. It would only really matter in real time embedded level of performances for, say, aircraft.
You'd have to parse either way. File IO also takes time. U think the difference would be negligible from a user's perspective. Though, avoiding bans would be a good reason to cache the info disk-side
Instead of explaining, I'll point you to r/unixporn (:

Very cool. What microscope do you use? What do you use it for? Are there any affordable microscopes that that allow 3D data capture somehow?
Now you can forever fuck with her by replying in weird random sentences. She'll never know if it's robot, or you.

Which is the problem with a NN. How good it gets is dependent on the specificity of the speakers. Two intimate speakers will have low specificity in speech because they can pick up generally what the other person means without being specific. You even outline the issue which is since it's trying to build a conversation poorly from previous statements, once you confuse her, your off the rails. Unless of course you confuse your wife a lot? So there is no way to make the NN that much better here imo, it's handicapped by very practice in thinking the algo can make sense of this problem in any sufficiently efficient manner. There needs to be some NLP in here and I assume you could build a NN ontop of the NLP to obtain something with far better results but a NN alone here, it's too dependent on the initial dataset and ultimately never makes sense of "language" in any high level fashion.
I know you think the code is too sloppy, but for real, you should post it anyway. I want to try this with co-workers, using Slack messages for the training data. For fun, but also to get into the data science side of our innovation team, I want to build something like this and see who figures out they're talking to a bot.
Plz post recommended and link for webcam
One day when you get home from work early you'll find the bot in your bed wearing your pyjamas and drinking your beer. :D
I'd love to see an updated recording of it in action, please make another post.

Haha I laughed so hard, "- Library? - Yes - Where? - Church" That doesn't have any sense, it's so funny ! But it's a nice project, I like it :)
You will need GPT-2 to act as your divorce lawyer.
Nice job.. I won’t try that since i’m positive She’ll leave me for another man after that conversation
Without authentication?
yes, to open an archive file .pst. not sure why authentication would be needed.. this would be done locally
Are you using a recurrent neural network? That would probably give you a big improvement since it will follow some kind of logical sequence. Library to church to lunch to city was a bit all over the place haha
Yes, it is based on an RNN (LSTM to be exact). There are a few issues I think that can explain why it feels random (scattered over this thread): it has no notion of time nor place, generic conversation is very broad so difficult to model, and lastly, once we get some "confusing" answers to the bot, it has a hard time recovering since this obviously isn't in the data :-) But thanks for at least finding it entertaining \^\^
Maybe use the subject of the sentence as input to the rnn? Might have to find a grammar library. It's still pretty cool. I bet it was creepy training a bot to imitate you
Well because you are trying to open personal email archives. That can be exported and moved around. So the fact that is local doesn't mean it's.. Sensible. I am not aware of anything outside outlook that can do that, sorry. Or at least where outlook is involved, for the reassuring authentication.
Is this supposed to be a success? And how did you 'trick' her into doing it, she's just responding to what she thinks is you having a fucking stroke. There's no real trick involved. Worst Black Mirror episode ever
I see what you mean. Thanks anyway!

"Tricked" is an overstatement, I left disappointed. Cool project though, try not too set expectations too high :P (avoid clickbaity headlines)
You should add a setup.py. It's really easy. You mentioned your dependencies the the readme, but you could just as easily put them in the install_requires argument of setup.

Awesome project! Would definitely love to look through the code
Option #3 is to never sleep again.

Thanks to all of the tips! Here are the changes: * I put all of the data into the json, so the script doesn't require you to be online. Also just pulling from the json is faster than making a request every time * The script now reads for updates at the end of the file (so the file is only loaded once and read through in its entirety once) * It's only 40-some lines of code. Not really important but I like small numbers * I'm padding out this list * Paths aren't hardcoded in * The cache has been changed to only the most recent cell. This means that if you go from cell 1 to cell 2 then back to cell 1 it will load cell 1's data twice. This is for when you cross over a cell border but you haven't finished reading, so you can just go straight back instead of scrolling
[Done and done](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/byox9n/update_to_my_fallout_4_script_it_is_much_faster/)
Thanks! Yeah 'Cheese' is nice, I didn't even think of trying it out with my microscope 😄. Oh well, at least I've got some TKinter experience now!
I use an Omax compound microscope (not sure on the model off the top of my head because I got it a long time ago). I think that it was about $400AUD and I have absolutely no complaints. I'm a PhD student in a theoretical chemistry group at the moment so I don't get much use out of it for work so nowadays I mostly just use it for fun, looking at blood, water samples, etc. Honestly, I couldn't advise you about other microscopes and/or if 3D data capture is even possible (I doubt it) for a compound microscope as I'm not an expert. I know of a technique called 3D electron microscopy that is regularly in use in the biology community but you're talking millions of dollars for one of them probably ...
Thanks for the tip. I'll have a look into it and add it in to v1.1!
It would be cool if you could also train the neural net with the hour of the day to get accurate time-based replies

Nice! I'd love to see you continue to train this bot while randomly subjecting her to it's testing! It'd be interesting to potentially see her getting less and less prone to pointing out when it's a bot vs it being you.
PYTHONPATH is your answer. Take a look at page below. https://bic-berkeley.github.io/psych-214-fall-2016/using_pythonpath.html
I don't think FuckDataCaps was suggesting that the responses actually were random, just that they were only as useful as completely random responses.
In "generic conversation" there is no real goal so it is very difficult to be useful at all lol :) And I think you underestimate how wrong it could go with actual random replies ;)
I know. But I think I'll go to the library.

Or always sound sleepy. So I'd pretty much just use my normal vocal tune.
I once trained an non AI bot which just remembered sentences that it didn’t know an answer to and replayed them back storing the answer that the other person gave. If exactly the same message came back in the future it would reply with one of the answers for that message that it knew. If it didn’t recognize the message it would reply with something random from either the message or replies. (btw in 1986) This sounds pretty inane but in a way small kids learn to speak this way. Since we talked to it a lot, it could hold fairly convincing conversations if the other person wasn’t that talkative. Great work in automating your bot with Selenium and getting it work but you might find that you get similar results if you just replay random replies that appeared before in your extensive conversation history.
Should this work on Manjaro as it is Arch based, or only Arch?
I'm not sure where I went wrong but I cant seem to get it fixed, anyone has any tips?
The issue is in the previous line. Missing a square bracket at the end
When you get a syntax error the error is commonly on an earlier line - so that’s usually a good place to start looking if nothing looks wrong on the current line
You forgot a bracket on the line above
Oh. Cant believe I missed that lol, thank you
You also have a double opening square bracket on the previous line *
Not everything is about raw compute speed. Both Reddit and Dropbox are examples of businesses using python. There's a massive project at my work that uses python to some extent too. Sometimes python is fast enough for the task
