Permissions on UNIX-style file-systems are hierarchical. This means that if a directory that owns your file is not accessible to your user, then the files in it won't be accessible to your user too, even if files have less restrictions. &gt; I get the errrors: /Users/Sam1/Documents/LinkedIn Trainings/Python/Ex_Files_Python_EssT/Exercise Files/Chap01/hello-version.py: line 4: import: command not found /Users/Sam1/Documents/LinkedIn Trainings/Python/Ex_Files_Python_EssT/Exercise Files/Chap01/hello-version.py: line 6: syntax error near unexpected token `'This is python version {}'.format' /Users/Sam1/Documents/LinkedIn Trainings/Python/Ex_Files_Python_EssT/Exercise Files/Chap01/hello-version.py: line 6: `print('This is python version {}'.format(platform.python_version()))' &gt; which makes me think it does not recognize any of the python syntax As has been suggested before: you are trying to execute Python file with your shell (probably Bash), instead of Python interpreter. Either add a shebang comment, something like #!/bin/env python or call `python` with `hello-version.py` as an argument to it. However, you may get permissions error if you are trying to execute a program, which doesn't have executable bit set (unfortunately, it will give this misleading message). Your later errors make me suspect that that was the source of your problem. ---- PS. For beginner, it's probably OK, or even advisable to use `sudo pip install`. The danger of this is that you will accidentally ruing your system because `pip` is a really crappy package manager and it might overwrite your system libraries with what you asked it to install (but the chance of this happening isn't very high, way less than 1%). If you work on a Mac, which is what it looks like, nothing critical depends on Python, so, you can screw up your system's Python installation, and nothing really bad will happen. The benefit of using `sudo pip install` is that all your installed packages will end up in a single predictable location, where, if need be, you can manually remove or edit them. They will be universally accessible to you whenever you invoke `python`. Once you are ready for writing projects that are meant for production environment, you will have to educate yourself about Python's infrastructure, the virtual environment, package managers and plethora of utilities that come with them. At that point, `sudo pip install` will not be your tool of choice, but, if you are only learning the language, don't bother yourself with infrastructure: you are likely to make terrible choices if you go there (for example, `pipenv` is the worst evil you can run yourself into, if you follow plenty of advises in this thread / subreddit / StackOverflow and the likes, but you wouldn't even know how bad it really is).
Cool. A few recommendations: * Include pyperclip so that it's easy to copy art to the clipboard. * Get rid of the `number` keyword argument: it's easy enough to use string replication to do this ("There should be one --and preferably only one-- way to do it."): `art("woman" * 2` instead of `art("woman", number=2)` * Have a function that does the reverse of art: takes the art output and returns the string name of it. * Get rid of `art("random")` and `art("rand")` and instead make it a separate function: `randart()` * Add documentation to the readme that lists the complete set of art, rather than have that separate link.
Will all due respect, I believe you are compleletely overestimating the average level of Matplotlib users. Actually I agree with you that "advanced" users could get more love in the docs, but not so long ago there was some arguments among core devs as to whether Matplotlib tutorials should include explanation about keyword arguments and `**kwargs` (I thought not). Still, in that setting, I think that gridspec is actually a pretty bad way of teaching Python -- in `gs = GridSpec(3, 2); fig.add_subplot(gs[:2, 0])`, `gs[:2, 0]` is a SubplotSpec that's created by, eh, overriding `__getitem__` on a custom class to return a custom marker object? That's actually quite advanced, whereas `fig.add_subplot(2, 2, 1)` (for example) is really not that hard to understand (yeah, it's 1-based indexing, that sucks, yada yada). The same comment applies to forcing people to explicitly create a Text object for setting the title (in the other discussion thread): that's way too complex for the majority of users, and quite clunky too. It doesn't mean that we can't add "docs for advanced users" (again I agree that they are lacking), but none of us is paid to write them either (to be totally fair I *think* one of the core devs may get 20% from his employer? not sure). We don't even have the manpower to go review the 259 currently open PRs(!) though that doesn't mean you can't contribute some more :) Same comment applies re: `Artist.set()` Also, even though I am quite familiar with Matplotlib's internals and OO approach (and have extensive experience with embedding Matplotlib in Qt apps), I actually think (like most others...) that the stateful system is quite practical for day-to-day, throwaway scripts (load some text file generated by some other program, plot it, call it a day). Still, there is *some* effort on moving the docs away from pyplot (check the git logs if you don't believe me...). As for replacing `plot()` by `add_line(Line2D(x, y))`, I don't know whether you'd still be in favor of the "explicit" interface if I really list everything that `plot()` actually does (now I'm just listing things off the top of my head, I may actually have missed some more): - check whether x and y have "units", and if so set the axis tickers accordingly (that's why you can plot datetimes (numpy or pandas) and get properly labeled axis) - advance the style cycler (i.e. the *stateful* thing that makes the first call to `plot()` give you a blue line, the second one an orange line, the third one a green line and so on) (you may not like it because it's stateful, but again it's really practical...) - re-autoscale the axis based on the margins; but there's more magic involved to not add margins when you call `imshow()` because who wants margins around their image? (so what happens when you mix calls to `imshow()` and to `plot()`? hehe) At some point you just need to decide whether you'd prefer just writing against the API of the underlying rasterization library...
Replied on the other thread to avoid splitting the discussion.
In the grand scheme, Python is in its infancy. There is much older and far more established terminology that has laid the foundation of knowledge for IT professionals in the past handful of decades. The idea of master/slave communication pervades nearly all levels of hierarchy in an information system. For example, the SPI communication protocol cannot be examined or explained without mentioning either term. The idea of human slavery being consistent with the term slave in IT terminology is baseless conjecture. Here's an appropriate analogy: Java is to javascript as slave is to slavery.

&gt; I've not read this documentation and cannot say, but the "parent/child" thing from fork is not the same thing. Well then read the documentation; the relevant part is a few sentences. Py3.7 introduced a feature (`gc.freeze()`) that lets you turn off the gc on a process. They suggest you do this on the parent process when you create tons of forked processes that will use the parent process memory (so you don't want the parent process to undergo expensive/wasteful garbage collection). See [bug report where gc.freeze()](https://bugs.python.org/issue31558) was introduced that correctly used terms parent/child. However, the documentation had a poor word choice: here's the original (~~strikethrough~~) and updated (*italics*) documentation: &gt;.. function:: freeze() &gt; Freeze all the objects tracked by gc - move them to a permanent generation and ignore all the future collections. This can be used before a POSIX fork() call to make the gc copy-on-write friendly or to speed up collection. Also collection before a POSIX fork() call may free pages for future allocation which can cause copy-on-write too so it's advised to disable gc in ~~master~~ *parent* process and freeze before fork and enable gc in child process. Again, in this situation, it's the example where you fork a memory-intensive parent process to create many child processes with initially identical memory. There's no indication that the parent process is in any way needs to be controlling the child processes. The next multithreading example is vaguer. They describe a situation using `multiprocesing.pool.Pool` where it will fail if you use it in an interactive interpreter (versus run in a module). They mention trying to do so will create interleaved tracebacks and will leave the ~~master~~ *parent* process running. Both terms are correct -- the process left running is strictly the parent (in an OS sense, it spawned the child processes) as well as the process that controls what's done in the pool of child worker processes. Regardless, the intended point of the documentation is 100% clear in both cases. No one has shown me any loss of clarity or extra hassle in the proposed documentation changes. That's why I think the virtue signaling is ridiculous.
You’re right the idea of some machine that “in charge” dictating commands to other machines that must obey is pretty well captured in the analogy of the master-slave. But what if you knew that it upset people of color to read your code or documentation while hearing about masters and slaves? Could it appear insensitive especially since there are plenty of examples of how the history of slavery hasn’t been fully reckoned with in American society ? If that can be avoided, I’d like to avoid it. I fact I have edited my code to remove the “master” nomenclature. I haven’t had to think about or be affected by slavery, but I thought about future readers and how they might feel about it. I think you’re halfway there in that these terms to refer to “hierarchy in information systems”. Is there less burdensome language that can be used to discuss these ideas? 
I had no idea this existed, which kinda surprises me. Thanks for the overview!

I don't mind in the slightest in avoiding offense where it can be spared but I argue the legitimacy of the offense; the subjectivity is wrong at the core--the terms master/slave aren't the same as human enslavement, bar the actual words. That's why I likened it to java/javascript because they use the same words but they aren't the same in meaning or use at all. I do want to address the assumption of my race, too. I feel there's a lot to be said if I personally don't take offense. Not to marginalize anyone else but catering to everyone's whimsy is counterproductive. Let me also add that slavery is *not* exclusive to African Americans and the United States. I really **don't** want to get into the subject but I want to mention that slavery in America (Chinese, Irish, African American, Haitian, etc) has been addressed, abolished, and reparations have been made to those affected (not fully but none alive can make any claim of loss). It doesn't make it right but *it doesn't make it relevant*. There's plenty of things in history that can be a stick in anyone's craw but it's been generations past, now. Anyway, getting back to what's appropriate here, I truly think the idea of removing master/slave terminology from all of Python is a pointless endeavor. If a dev opts to replace the words in a script, that's great and I applaud it but the effort of removing all of it--especially from other implementations outside of Python--is just time wasted on things that could be better spent elsewhere.

&gt;Well that's pretty much how many others feel about those pushing for the changes. You understand I'm not pushing for these changes. I'm just stating the level of pushback against incredibly minor documentation word choice is crazy, when both the original and modified documentation are clear. I feel this sort of pushback would be necessary if say python made breaking changes to code that create maintenance nightmares for silly reasons (like renaming `dict` because someone claimed it sounds phallic and sexist). I don't agree with the people claiming offense for the original use or for those offended by the though of the PC police forcing them to change their language, but then again you can't logically argue with feeling -- and some people may legitimately take offense either way. But I do agree with the people like GvR (ex-BDFL) accepting the word changes (when reasonable) and shutting down debate over it. I don't think he's doing it because he thinks the terms were intended to be offensive, or are truly objectionable, or anything like that. It's just that in these instances they can be changed with little effort, and changing it will prevent people from complaining about this again down the line. Closing down debate on bike-shed questions (where you need no expertise to express your opinion) in open source projects always seems reasonable. Similarly, if I was starting an open source distributed database today, had been aware of this debate, I'd 100% choose to call the non-primary instances "replicas" (or other seemingly non-controversial language) instead of "slaves"; not because I think one term is actually offensive, but because I think I may have to deal with unnecessary controversy with one term.

First ask yourself why the company paying you to do something hasn't automated the process already. The answer is it's cheaper to pay you than to pay someone to make a program to do that. Inevitably some companies will see the long term benefits and hire someone to automate it. Be that person.
No I'm really just in a trolling war with my friend so I want to spam his server for a little bit and I only really skimmed the API but if there is anything important could you point it out?
...this is a quality contribution to /r/python
Keep you stigma to yourself. The master/slave argument is simply stupid and python should not be involved with politics and some SJW mood swings.
I googled [spam a discord server with python](https://www.google.com/search?q=spam+a+discord+server+with+python&amp;rlz=1CDGOYI_enUS748US748&amp;oq=spam+a+discord+server+with+python&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.6314j0j4&amp;hl=en-US&amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;ie=UTF-8) did you try that?
Did you find anything good?
A few GitHub repos with exactly what you’re describing that you could clone and fire away with little effort you little troll.
You're an idiot.
You're gonna get yourself banned. I know how to spam a discord server but there's no way in hell I'm encouraging or aiding that sort of petty behavior.
It's not like we don't want to troll each other we just one day said hey let's start a troll war because there is nothing fun anymore and while he is going for one approach I'm going for the coding which is good because I wanted to learn coding for a while but had no motivation

&gt;I disagree with the motivation for and the decision to remove the English words Master and Slave. Why? How does it hurt you in any way to change terms to something possibly even more precise? Why not use leader/follower, primary/secondary/tertiary/etc, producer/consumer, or any of the hundreds of other ways to express the relationships in software? How this is a topic for conversation, or anybody cares enough to say they disagree with the decision is well beyond my understanding. I nominate Brock and Doc. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Venture_Bros.
Made a little scrip that goes on trading economics, grab economics indicators for a few country and export them in csv, Then I have a macro that import csv files and update the economic data I follow more closely for each country/dates... working to implement machine learning for forecasting (not there yet, this part is mostly for fun!)
At best (if you pretend the name of the app is "Chrome"), it is missing the contact info and version string. At worst, it's an attempt to spoof the user-agent of a popular browser. My guess is that it was included in the code because the default user-agent was getting severely limited.
How much time has been spent on the corresponding discussion? If the concern was really about wasted time the entire thing would be done and forgotten by now. It’s not a major change to the terminology and it’s not much different in terms of time spent as other nice to have refactorings. It’s a change that could have been taken quietly and would likely have been unnoticed by the vast majority of people working with the language if not for the political backlash. This is a big deal about such a small thing.
This is a ridiculous argument at every level. _Muh censorships!_ Yeah, society is asking us not to use words that some people find hurtful, insulting, or bigoted. Quick! Clutch your pearls! The only argument against changing how we speak when someone legitimately tells us our statements are hurtful is that we _intend_ to be assholes to them. It's not virtue signalling, it's being polite and considerate to each other. We don't use derogatory words for gay people, or people of different ethnicities either. Do you see that as an affront to language? The words master and slave have no other connotation except the one being discussed. _But electrical circuits use the term, too!_ Yeah, for the same reason. Slave has a single meaning, the etymology has a single initial meaning. Human beings forced into labor by other human beings. The feigned outrage at changing words used is ridiculous at its very core, but it does serve a great utility in identifying foolish people at an instant.
A tiny script that logs in to my Linux servers, runs a few commands to collect system metrics(like CPU, Memory, disk and network usage), copy the metrics files to local. Need to further extend this to plotting graphs using the data.
I am not outraged. I am not feigning anything. You really are jumping wholeheartedly into this. The real point of my post was regarding Arch and Hench. I have a lot to say in reply to you here, but it seems foolish to engage you, given what you have assumed. I'll keep my rebuttal of you to myself.
This isn’t virtue signaling. As far as I can tell, there was no plan on even announcing the change had been made. Reading through the issue, care was taken to preserve the terminology where it needed to be preserved.
None of those terms capture the precise relationship as well as the original terms, which is not to say there isn't some non-loaded naming convention that does. The terminology as stands indicates there is one entity that gives a command that must be followed and another entity that may not disobey that command. Leader/Follower implies some level of discretion in following instructions. Primary/secondary/etc. is a ordinal indication of preference. Producer/Consumer arguably reverses the command relationship between the entities. I really don't care what terminology is used since master/slave is often not an accurate description of the relationship between entities in a program, and if the syntax bothers some, it's not like this is holy writ or anything. This could be a good opportunity to formalize the different relationships that have been rolled together under master/slave and give them proper descriptive names.

`f2format` is an intelligent, yet imperfect, solution for *f-string* literal compatibility. You may write *f-string* literals in **Python 3.6** flavour, and compile to a compatible version for end-users to run, just like [`Babel`](https://github.com/babel/babel) for JavaScript. `f2format` shall replace *f-string* literals with `str.format` methods, whilst maintaining the original layout of source code. You can simply use ``` f2format /path/to/the/file_or_directory ``` which will rewrite all Python files in place. For instance, ```python # original source code var = f'foo{(1+2)*3:&gt;5}bar{"a", "b"!r}boo' # after f2format var = ('foo{:&gt;5}bar{!r}boo').format(((1+2)*3), ("a", "b")) ``` String concatenation, conversion, format specification, multi-lines and unicodes are all treated right. Also, `f2format` will archive original files in case there're any syntax breaches.

I use word list if it can contain elements of different type otherwise i use word array. Thanks for the feedback, let me make it more explicit. Numpy is only for arrays, i.e. it cannot store elements of different type so in this respect it is a specialized library. Q's list is general, so it would be like comparing apple to orange... nevertheless i will cover Numpy in my next post.
Yes, that would be a longer post, but definitely worth comparing them.
It might not be an issue in your specific case, but when I see code with mutable default arguments my reaction will always be to assume bugs. It's all about making sure other people trust your code, something I definitely will not do with any library that uses mutable defaults.

I simply judged the outcome of some engineering teams, which was poor. No product is gonna ship perfect, but those products were poorly made. I do not attack people when I say that they do not understand engineering, I simply try to educate people on that matter. Unfortunately I tend to be too forward. Things like "we need a black guy, a gay guy an asian guy, some chicks and a trans person" and the only reason those people are needed is because of their skin colour or their sexual preference, are racist. Hire a smart engineer that happens to be black, asian, etc. The criteria should be competence.

I have no problem, where did you see format issues on your side ?
We had hundreds of websites, to manage in my last job spread over around a dozen different hosting providers. Nothing was documented, so whenever a site we hadn't worked in a while had issues, it took a while to find where it was even hosted. I wrote a python script to look up the IP and Host and print it to a CSV: [https://github.com/sarcoma/Look-Up-Domain-IP-and-Host](https://github.com/sarcoma/Look-Up-Domain-IP-and-Host) Nothing mind blowing, but it was incredibly useful to crawl all the sites we had in our database. Turns the database hadn't been updated properly in years, about a third of the sites on file no longer existed. A few of which where still being invoiced for while some live sites weren't being invoiced at all. &amp;#x200B;

I made a script which sends settings to a signal generator and takes samples from an oscilloscope. It seems you commands to both over USB using py-visa. It's able to take different measurements from the Oscope several times and average them. I'm able to automate an rather fiddly experiment and plot the results with the press of a button.
So maybe this was the miscommunication - because I **was** talking about `attr.s`. I assumed _in this post_, which is about the attrs package, everything is related to `attr.s`...

This a vague question, but here's what I have done in the past... If you are truly wanting to use mpl, then take a look at `mpl.widgets`. There's some tools in there that allow you to cobble together a barely functional UI for data entry. This is a poor-man's UI, aka a programmer's UI. If you want interactivity without REPL'ability (i.e. want an actual interface for non programmers), then I suggest you take a look at `bokeh` which allows you to embed an entire graph into a self contained html page, allowing you to pick and mute individual graphs.

(Like ssh\_stdin, ssh\_stdout, ssh\_stderr = ssh.exec\_command("vmstat -S M 2 10 &gt; /tmp/vmstat.txt &amp;")). Similarly, I am running all the required stat collection commands. At the end of my test, I am using scpclient (from scp import SCPClient) to connect to my machine and pull these files to local machine and do all the computations.
I switched all my project's shell scripts for python. It's a multi-platform project, so having to install bash on windows was a pain in the ass (it never works as well as it does on linux). Since the project already is mostly python, I changed all scripts to python. Not only are they easier than ever to modify (shell scripting sucks), they now are completetly cross-platform. I also made a script with CLI support to send emails using the Sendgrid service, since I could never get the "mail" command to work. I use it with cron to send daily reminders to me.
Developed a simulator and optimizer for a ride sharing company, which will assign nearest cab based on minimum distance detour, vehicle capacity, max detour time and max wait time for passengers, I have used SimPy module. Let me know if someone has similar requirement, same could be used for a real time parcel delivery service.
- Editing is a plan but definitely not too far away. By the way, there is a JQuery DatePicker popup, you weren't supposed to type the date - I am kind of confused for sorting, should it be according to 'added on' date? or 'to be completed by' date? Or should I let the users decide the priority between high, medium and low. Thanks!

Also, after computing I want to plug it in with this [SMTPmailSendingScript](https://github.com/AkshayD110/smtpEmailSender) I have written, to send auto results.

I'm a huge fan of the pluralsight course, which you can access for free with a MSDN account. \[This GeorgiaTech one\]([https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computing-for-data-analysis](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computing-for-data-analysis)) isn't bad either.
It's nothing political, though. Its tell multi-discipline engineers like myself that I have to unlearn something and replace it with another word, breaking mental associations, rewriting papers, docs, thousands on thousands of lines of code, and repurchasing the dozen on dozens of regence manuals I have because nobody ever seemed to have a problem with it now. You know, I've never heard any of the Chinese Americans make so much as a squeak about their enslavement in the US. Should we remove all forms and references of railroads, TNT, and trains? No, because *that* would be unreasonable. I'm not being the stick in the mud and I'm not being obstinate but the entire idea is stupid. I work with developers of every nationality and background and none have ever been offended by that terminology. I wish people would quit catering to the clowns of our society. There shouldn't be validation for unsubstantiated BS. I've never held my hand out for any type of reparation because neither me, my parents, grandparents, or their parents were ever slaves. The term is not offensive and to remove it from every area is to act like it never existed. See, *that* isn't okay. What I feel people aren't understanding here is how pervasive the master/slave terminology is. Entire technologies will have to be rewritten and every supporting document will follow suite. What about endorceing open source products? That's a lot of time and effort that can go to make the language better, promote diversity in the STEM fields, bridging gaps in assisting our elderly on how python can be used to enhance their day-to-day. The list goes on. In the same vein, I'm gonna call the next BS move: petition started to remove the black wire as representing the ground wire.
I would love to see how you did this. I have about 6 years worth of email stuck in lotus notes that I would love to get into Outlook
Didn't upload it yet, needs more polishing but I can provide the key logging script as an edit asap. Used pynput library and export each key-press as a txt and runs in background. I know, sounds fishy but statistics fun.
Automated the backup and restore of all versions of our Proficy PLC/HMI projects as part of upgrading to the latest version of Proficy where the new version control backend (SVN) was incompatible to the previous version (VSS). The GE tech support person I spoke to said it was impossible to migrate so I used the COM interface to automate it. I look forward to never having to work with Proficy Machine Edition and GE PLCs ever again...
Multi Window with side by side scrolling, git Integration and a built in terminal to run the stuff you code
By the way you may wish to take a look at Quandl. They have many public data sets available for free and they're all cleaned up
what kind of ML packages work for this?
I have hundreds of users in a VPN system that is about to be decommissioned, and that VPN doesn't provide a good way to export them with their individual settings. I'm not automating that part, I'm just suffering through manually preparing a csv containing each of their settings. But the part I am automating is avoiding having to slowly click through several different sections of a WebUI to add each user to the new system. Using python, I'm reading the csv file I mentioned and calling various CLI commands of the new system to add each user, create a group for them, add them to the group, set their permissions, and a few other details. The biggest batch of users I have thrown at it so far is about 50, and I'm 100% sure my code could be more efficient, but I feel like I'm witnessing a well oiled machine as I watch the terminal output scrolling by whenever I use it. It takes a little bit longer to cycle through the CLI commands than I would have expected, but it's still (of course) order of magnitude faster than adding a large number of users via the GUI.
I'm saving this thread to get ideas. :-)
Really nice work. Some feeback: when mentioning the logging breakpoint, you say that you will get to using expressions later, yet I don't believe that you mentioned them. 
Not OP, but I think he means this: https://tradingeconomics.com/
I'm in a weird spot with programming too. Not a professional developer or anywhere close, but I've dabbled in 6 or 7 languages over the years for various reasons. I'm not using dabbled lightly - some of those it was just a 1 semester course, others it was that I wrote one or two things to scratch an itch at the time. Dabbling is, if anything, an exaggeration of how experienced I am with some of them. :-) Python is my favorite so far, for the things I'm likely to do, but like you I'm new, I just wrote my first (and only) Python script about 2 months ago. I went [here](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/), started reading at the beginning, and went through every exercise while starting to write the script I knew I needed on the side, when I learned something that applied to what I was trying to do. Along the way was a little google, and I'm ashamed to admit that I stopped with the "course" once my script was done. I do intend to go through the entire book, but things have been too busy. Anyhow, the author does a good job of explaining, and of breaking things into small chunks. It's easy and enjoyable to read, and I found it to be a great intro. It's also free. 
At this points it's not even "Script Kiddies" anymore...

We occasionally direct ship products to our customers and have to remember to check to see if they have been delivered. Our vendor makes text files available of shipped orders every night by FTP. We download the text files, parse them and put into a SQLite database made for this purpose. We then hit the UPS API once per hour checking the tracking numbers provided in the download. Once the shipment has been delivered, we are notified by email. This was my first Python project and did it while recovering from surgery. 
Last thing in Python at work was, some time ago, to recursively read our Maven POM (xml) files in a directory and show which projects have dependencies to the same thing but the versions are different. Makes it easier to spot mismatches, or where someone has bumped one version in one project that we might want to bump elsewhere.
I don't think your web app appreciates being called that
Oh, great. Do you know a similar resource with more stock indices?
I used to make a report in Excel, which was downloading an xls, converting to xlsx, deleting columns and find out unique entries. This took ~3 hours because of Excel being unable to handle ~50k rows. Use openpyxl I made the whole process ~4 minutes. Trying to move all our reporting to python
I understand what you are saying. I'm just pointing out that: 1. Many of the examples you are giving having nothing to do with the stated reason for the change because they don't use "slave" it's just "master" as in "main." 2. And if there were instances of "master/slave" there is a reasonable argument for not changing it just because that terminology has a well understood meaning. So I don't see how those objecting to the change have to be virtue signaling. In the one instance where the change is for the stated reasons there is a good reason from a clarity perspective to keep the old language. The great irony here is probably that despite the stated reason being about "master/slave", there may not be a single instance of that in the documentation. 
Thank you!
Very cool! I need to learn more about scraping. What did the company you work for end up charging (since they had quoted it to take so long)? Were they happy about this or not?
Checkout saltstack. The only thing you'd have to build in python is the computation at the end but everything else is a built in module. 
They charged what they had quoted for, I made them about 3 months of my wages in half a day.
Thanks for the tips! I definitely have a lot to work on, especially on the Seaborn side.
Sound, no rush mate! 
Scrapy + Beautiful Soup https://scrapy.org/ https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/
I work for a SaaS company. Customers have *things*, they can create many of them, they can turn them on and off. If they're on they consume resources, even if they're doing nothing they take disk space and memory. Someone wrote a script a few years ago that would shut some of them off every morning based on some fuzzy criteria. It wasn't targeting the right stuff, paying customers were having infrastructure turned off. I rewrote the script about 6 months ago with much more exacting criteria. It was twice as accurate as the original and ran 10x faster. I've been tweaking it every couple weeks for the past 6 months because we keep finding new edge cases that we want to account for. Honestly it's one of my favorite tasks I've done at this job, it's simple, it's impactful, I get to see improvements in efficiency and meet requirements exactly, I get asked questions about it all the time and can answer them with intimate detail. I wish I could just write shit like this all day.
i have tried even to log in google accounts but still not work
Primary/secondary definitely doesn't have the same connotation as master/slave. A slave is controlled by the master in some way. Secondary is more like some kind of backup or alternative to the primary.
Parent/child is somewhat different to master/slave though.
Deployment of software updates to remote servers, dropbox backup, and update feeds. 
So do you guys write the scripts at work or in your own time? I'm an intern software engineer and I'm trying to get a feel for what is and is not acceptable to do at work.
Alright then feel free to just assume bugs that aren't there, I have no problem with that.
Had to get help from a friend due to only using python for a month but, we built a script to update a website with vehicle specials by price from a spread sheet with over 100 offers which took about an hour or so each month. We are just 2 more scripts away and it will do what would take 2 straight days of updates and just run day and night till all our websites have been completely update. I also am excited that when my manager saw it he offered my friend a job to help take months of requests from our IT department and just have him create scripts for any repetitive task that our department does within a few days. 
So like atop?
Lol. In my first job, they used to talk about the POS system. Took me ages to work out that they meant "point of sale". It didn't help that the system interface was from the stone age.
&gt; Note the in Python to get absolute, negate, sign and logarithmic of a value you need to use Python core and three additional packages. You definitely need a cheat sheet to remember that. What a load of bullshit, how about you don't use the most inconvenient way just to get the point across: import numpy as np l = [2, -1, 3] list(map(np.abs, l)) list(map(np.sign, l)) list(map(np.negative, l)) list(map(np.log10, l)) Of course, you could just to it the sane way when doing vector math in Python. l = np.array([2, -1, 3]) np.abs(l) np.sign(l) -l np.log10(l) Furthermore, neither the "operator" nor the "math" package are third-party packages. They are part of the Python standard library. They are just not brought into the global namespace by default because Python is a general purpose language and unless you do a math thing you likely will not need those very often. Frankly, this constant riding on insisting to use Python lists as a data structure that they aren't intended for (vector math) while ignoring Numpy which is made for exactly that purpose was painful to read. Along with the other inaccuracies it makes me question the motives of the author. It feels like you had the end result in mind and wanted to get there no matter how much you had to bend the facts. Also, make your code examples into actual text instead of images. It might help when people want to copy your fragments.
In my company we did a whole website migration for better loading times and boring technical staff.. I wanted to quickly QA all the pages to make sure nothing is missing so basically I needed a web crawler with domain comparison. I wrote such a crawler that also checked: Google SC, GTM, HS snippets, redirects, internal links, external links, body text, titles &amp; descriptions, alt texts, images and couple other small features I don’t currently remember. That little project saved me from going through 300 x2 pages manually every time the dev guys change something. I love automation. I want to automate all my life at some point so that automatically I’ll get paid every month, call my parents to tell them I’m fine and in the mean time I’ll travel across the world. Like physically traveling. There’s no excuse not to experience every culture there is out there :)
That's exactly what i need for my next project, thanks for sharing.
At my company ( Cyberdyne Systems ), I worked on a neural network. Purpose was to create a Digital Defense Network and remove all elements of human error and slow reaction times. I worked on it for a few years, but had to close it down due to some unforeseen side effects in it's automated procedures. I think management decided to continue the project in an android variant.... Besides this I've been working on a webscraper gathering data from Amazon, formatting and sending data to an SQL table and then visualize through Python/Dash as a webinterface. Really fun project.
I’d be very interested in this if you care to share ? 
Nothing great, but I do have a script that takes abbrevations from a csv file, sorts them in alphabetical order and stores them as Latex table source code. Updating the csv is much less annoying than editing the table and keeping it sorted manually.
did u already choose a gui tool? I'd recommend u use pyqt with the inbuild designer tool. 
Yes. The search term you are after is "N body simulation", which is the physics term for such a thing - an arbitrary number of bodies influencing each other through gravity. There are a bunch of different methods in physics, and hence a bunch of implementations - searching N-body simulation pygame will get you both a rundown of the math and some implementations and some tutorials, although the tutorials tend to be either math heavy or "black box" - that's the nature of the problem.
That sounds awesome. How’d you learn that? I need something similar. 
When EEO pick a candidate from a list of equally qualified candidates, there's racial inequality. Please don't assume I refer any particular race here because it happens for everyone to meet diversity quotas. Same goes for colleges and universities. Why should it matter what I look like when I apply for admission or financial aid? The only thing that needs to be considered is meritorious achievement in academics, promise of achievement, and/or thr demonstrable means to show inability to afford the cost of higher education. See, when there are *far more* scholarships that are only made available to a particular race, there is where you'll find inequality. I saw all of that to say, yes, there are systems in place that do subjugate certain people based on race but it's not a single race. There's always a unique situation that holds one above the others for ever race. There, I've said all I have to say on the matter. I truly believe that making a deal out of the established jargon of the entire IT field for no reason other than "it could be offensive" is dead-center whimsy. Its illegitimate, baseless, and is itself a red herring. The entire point of the matter is the legitimacy and validation of the complaint at hand (is slave/master in IT offense or insensitive, necessitating removal). As an engineer, I'd like to see a study done on the userbase to determine only if someone has ever been offended by the jargon, not if anyone thinks it should be removed. I posit the return would be minuscule, below 1%. From there, analytically, would that be enough to warrant the action being done? Personally? Nah. Ergo, pointless whimsy.
When I was making my platformer game from scratch, i made my own "gravity". Lets say when i press space key, my character goes up. At the end of the update function, where all the logic and moving goes, I update my character's position by adding velocity vector and multiplying it with some delta time for FPS regulation. So when I press space key, I set some upwards vertical velocity and check if character is off the ground. If it is, every frame I subtract gravity from vertical velocity (velocity.y -= gravity). When the character hits the ground, vertical velocity is set to 0 and you just update horizontal velocity by moving left/right. That would be some simple gravity implementation in platformer game. You could also search google for implementing gravity and applying it to rockets or whatever that you want to do. 
In the departments I support, data is kept in Excel files, one for each process each day the process is worked and multiple sheets per file. There are dozens of processes worked each day. I wrote a couple functions that will allow me to verify whether or not the spreadsheets in a directory have the same headers and then insert the data into a database. The alternative is copying and pasting into a single spreadsheet from literally thousands of files from the past few years.
As part of a research project I had to crop out 50-80 small photographs from framed pictures and sort them with metadata for ingestion into a database. I wrote a script using Python and Google Cloud that used face detection to find each photograph with the bounds and then crop them all out for me. It took the processing time for one framed picture from a day or two (manual labour) to about 10-20 minutes, accounting for photos that were undetected and required manual attention.
The circuitous logic here is getting you nowhere. Python is still in its infancy. It's really not an opinion. This is reflected in its use and adoption. Contrastingly, SPI (serial peripheral interface) was made in the mid-80s. I'm not going to render an exhaustive list on all mentions of master/slave in information systems from a historical perspective. You can do that on your own and the information is there and supports what I'm saying. Neither using the terms nor the terms themselves are racist. So just stop.
This is better suited for r/learnprogramming. This isn't really related to Python 
I parsed server downtimes out of a logfile of a loadbalancer.
This is great! It will come in handy for sure.
Well I did, at 04:36 :-)
I'm familiar with PLC's and proficy but I'm not the PLC guy for my group. If you had your choice of software what would you pick over proficy and why?
[Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/) might have what you're looking for. 
Can we have this in reverse, to modernize formatting of old pre-fstring codebases?
The short answer is yes. I got hired at my company to look at legal documents and make sure all the right boxes are checked. There was a task that took ~120 hours a month for my department due to volume. I proposed to my supervisor and his boss a way to automate it (using VBScript) and they told me to work on it when I had time. I implemented it after a couple weeks, and it’s been in production for almost a year. This led to more automation and analysis work using VBA (not fun) and later Python (mostly fun). Now I use Python to extract data and build databases, to do analysis, and to build reports. I also work with Python off the clock. This weekend I learned about threading so I could use it in a project at work that is bottlenecked by network latency. As for what’s appropriate at work, the most important thing is approval from your supervisor. The second most important thing is whether or not it will actually benefit the company and to what extent. From my experience, companies don’t care so much about how you do what you do as long as it saves/makes time/money and is legal.
A normal asshole contractor would have sat on it for 3 months and produced a script in lisp so that the company would have to come back to them every time Well done
I was doing an internship at an economics think-tank and they asked me to download a lot of data and format it in excel. It was unimaginably tedious. I wrote a script in one weekend that downloads all the necessary files and formats them in excel. Ultimately, I gave my boss an .exe that does this whenever he wants for free and he was very content of it. It's nice when you can use basic python skills to help around. :)
Things = zaps
I'm currently working on a big intradepartmental project for an IT group and a lot of their day-to-day comes across my desk. I automate a lot of it for them. Last week I automated a meta-check of all failed systems and services because a lot of folks in their service desk like to mute problems and never deal with them -this not only checks them all, but unmutes the problems when the threshold is breached. Suddenly they have a lot less critical infrastructure failing. 
I used an obtuse solution. I found the notes database could be viewed in our intranet from my browser. I could see the pattern in the URL eg //server/databaseID/document ID. From Notes I exported a list of document IDs. Then in python I called the unique URL for each document and used beautiful soup to extract the images. I dont think it would work for your problem sadly.

Bit of a long shot, but I think Pygame would help with this. It's drawing routines are much faster than Tkinter and good support for keys... 
&gt; Nobody needs minimal text editors. Nobody needs "text editors" which hog half a GiB of RAM in idle mode.
Emacs key bindings.
if you can do use Jupyter you can do that inside it /:
The only thing a minimalist text editor **needs** to be able to do is open, write and close files. :-) If you plan to write one: Please don't. There already is `ed` (which I use for smaller changes), there already is `joe` for more advanced editing, there already are the minimalist `sam` and `acme` GUI text editors/IDEs for everything else.
To be fair, that's called CUA and it was introduced by IBM... :-)
And a mail client.
I don't know specifically, as there is more than one captcha implementation in the world, but nothing prevents them from storing session data server side. Particularly for something like a captcha, server side storage seems like it would be preferred. The thing you are looking to do is exactly something a service would put a captcha in place to prevent. 
Just automated the invoicing in QuickBooks for my bros company. -Using selenium Looking for more opportunities to automate things. It's incredible what you can do with a little knowledge. Python is the bomb. 
I made a python script that walks through out company git repository folders and reads a metadata file in each to create a web page showing all our repositories grouped bt client and language.
&gt; terms like master process was changed to main process No, if you look at that pull they changed it to `parent` and `child` in some cases. This is a problem because parent/child relationships in processes is already a well understood concept in UNIX and in forkserver and spawn that relationship is NOT parent/child, they are siblings. The fact of the matter is these terms have pre-existing meanings and you can't just willy-nilly change then around without changing the meaning. Now the docs imply something which is no longer the ground truth.
I use to work at a cabinet company that would call the customers three days before to remind them about their install. The info was on a system that would allow Excel exports. I made a script that reads an Excel file and sends out a text using twilio. Ultimately they didn't use it because office politics. I wasn't in that Dept and the manager for that Dept didn't see a point.
I am in the middle of automating the entire process if updating Palo Alto firewalls. Once complete I am moving on to Cisco switches. 
Whatever makes you feel good there bud.
I've built a couple of desktop webapps (too lazy for tkinter), that reduce my job from manually copy pasting stuff between Excel sheets from an internal website to automatically use that website's API calls to instead download data, clean it and create requisite Excel files. Unfortunately I haven't been able to automate the uploading of the files to an internal website, the damn site uses asp.net and view states that make it close to impossible. I've also automated 1hr of grueling with that is tied to validating that the files that are uploaded arrived at their destinations by using selenium. Was able to go through text logs of a server and combine with other tables to discern which computer is always running jobs on our server that makes it crash when we need it. Turns out, another python user is doing stuff around the busy times causing our servers to crash and burn halting everything. I also wrote some scripts to create a dashboard using dash and data from our outages database. It's a live stream too. Recently I've been doing more systems related scripting to change os variables and other things. Hoping to finally learn ml for a project I have in mind.
Thanks ;-)
Honestly just do it. Keep working on learning and reading tutorials or blogs about it. Find a problem you want to solve with programming and then break it down into the steps you need to code and start writing. it wont come easy (for most people and especially not me) and it won't come fast. But it will happen if you just keep writing code.
Yes, here's something for you: [`pyupgrade`](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade#pyupgrade) :)
Lexer is way overkill. Just write a regular expression.
Nice quality post 👍 
Trial and error. The way you'll learn anything is to just sit down and begin trying.
The left has taken over programming.
How did you went on the mail sending?
Can we get the script?
Seems really strange... I have used Selenium to login to other applications that require cookies to maintain identity. This is a complete guess but maybe Google is detecting that the browser is being driven by selenium and destroying session to avoid bot attacks?

As I understand your question; I used gmail library for construction and sending mail.
Our system uses a database to log every unhandled exception. I wrote a script that selects the last error from the database I'm using and outputs the stacktrace. &gt; last-error &gt; System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object. at ... Other developers open the GUI frontend of the database and type the select query. Boring! 
I didn't explain right but you got it. : ) Thanks didn't knew about the lib.
We had to recall inventory from 300 of our field technicians. They asked me to create 300 shipping labels manually. Instead I created 300 labels using our personnel database and a shipping label creation API. Took me 5 hours to create and I was a hero for a day at work :) I love python 
i don0t want to bypass that i just want that if i solve it once for the next 5 minutes it wil not appear again just like normal browsing
Python is a superior scripting language
Get into Data Engineering and you can write python all day!
OooOooo that's very cool! I wouldn't worry much about developing software that doesn't quite yet have a good way to run on a phone. It's only a matter of time to get Python there, or to have a relatively easy way of converting your concept to run on a phone. Keep it up! 
[Wes McKinney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_McKinney) (the creator of Python's pandas) and [Hadley Wickham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_Wickham) (creator of R's ggplot2) have released [Feather](http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2016/03/feather-a-fast-on-disk-format-for-data-frames-for-r-and-python-powered-by-apache-arrow/), a fast, lightweight, and easy-to-use binary file format for storing data frames. It is based on [Apache Arrow](https://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2016/02/introducing-apache-arrow-a-fast-interoperable-in-memory-columnar-data-structure-standard/), a cross-language development platform for in-memory data. Wouldn't it have made more sense to target Feather’s C++11 core instead of reinventing the wheel?
It's always acceptable to do at work. Python will save your company money as you learn to automate tedious tasks. The kinds of tasks they make the intern do!
I use Pandas to extract data out of Excel, it's very easy to work with
As somebody looking to learn about computer science, I really appreciate this thread because it is expanding my views of what it can actually do for me. So thank you guys :)
&gt; Finally, what's really the big deal? It's just documentation. Individuals in the industry are familiar with the terminology and what it means, so if you try and substitute an alternative term that would naturally make the documentation harder to understand. What is really strange about these changes is that many of them are from instances which are not examples of "master/slave" it is rather "master" aka "main" or "principal." For example: https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/9101 is probably a good change because the existing documentation called the parent process both the "master" process (in the sense that it is the main process which initializes all the others), and the "parent" process (which it objectively is). Nothing in that section of code is called or referred to as a slave. So while the delta is good, the description of the change and the rationale for the change is wrong. It makes the whole changeset seem that much sillier and understandably annoys people. If it said: "consistently refer to parent processes as 'parent' in documentation" and nobody would care.

Well it wasn't that recent, a little under 2 years ago. My company was hired to migrate specialized software packages (think objects) to new servers with new software. However, the old packages had to be rebuilt 1 by 1 on the new server with the same old properties and settings. Well, the thing was that the new software was not backwards compatible... so there was no export/import options. We contacted the original software developers and none had been there long enough to know or have an idea on how to get around this. Well my boss said to me, "we have a 6 month contract with the client to migrate all the packages to the new server. You're it. Document EVERYTHING and begin the migration. Good luck. I need updates every 2 weeks." I started doing it for a week and i began getting depressed. Like it just sucked. That's around the time I was just learning python programing and realized that to reasemble the packages I needed a new file structure with certain files or properties within the files... I began to script out for one package the disasembling, and reassembling of the packages. It took me 5 days and 2 sleepless nights but I finally got one package done. I then asked my boss to please stall the updates to the client until next week after I told him we could have this done in a week. He agreed. So I started figuring out how to loop through every package and then compare the two packages, log all the events and then delivered. This contract that should have lasted 6 months or more was done in 3 weeks. The script only took 10 mins to run. But my boss was impressed and the client couldn't believe it. We got paid the same amount regardless of time. It was very satisfying.
Fairly new to Python, but I do a lot of reporting and wanted to automate pulling of reports from a third party site where scheduling isn’t possible. Using selenium was able to navigate through site and pull the reports we need. Task scheduler runs the jobs daily. I know it’s simple, but it certainly provides value to my process.

Part of my research is incorporating FPGAs and radiation detectors. We've been using MATLAB as communication between the PC and FPGA, but I built a python script to replace all the main functionality that MATLAB executed.
I don't have I left it any more, it's on the company Bitbucket. There really wasn't much to it. It used scrapy to find and get the URLs then Beautiful Soup to parse the text, it then wrote to a text file named after the page title.

I think this is more of a 'you' problem. For example I have no clue who Qazi is, and I have no interest in learning. Assholes will be assholes, douche-bags will be douche-bags, etc. But I do think that as a result of Python having a MUCH lower barrier of entry than many other languages while also providing a lot of power leads to a higher concentration of these types. They're part of life and you'll run into them for the rest of your life. Best to learn to deal with them in a healthy way.
Thanks mate ;)
I run a lot of simulations at work. Several of the software tools take text based inputs for the simulations. I've written several scripts to either automatically generate those input files or edit existing files. Pretty simple text editing but still saved me a lot of time. I really want to do more in the future. 
We have a lot of computers and all of them are joined on a Windows domain. Each computer has a lot of user accounts. So the folders “C:\\Documents and Settings” and “C:\\Users” have a lot of folders, subfolders and files. &amp;#x200B; Whenever we want to reformat those computers (HDD Failures, Hardware upgrades etc), we take a backup of those two folders, which they contain all the data of the users. &amp;#x200B; I have wrote a python script, were you select the backup folder (e.g. F:\\Recovery\\Users) and cleans up all the useless files and folders (ntuser.dat, AppData, Contacts, Cookies etc), and all empty folders. So we end up with only the valuable data to give them back to the users.

I agree parent/child relationship has a defined meaning in OS than master/slave. Parent / chiid is about who created the process (in *nix typically via fork syscall or variants); master/slave is about who controls it and more equivalent to manager process / worker process. That said, look at the ACTUAL changes in the python source: First the term slave was only changed three times: 1. in python's [internal regression tests](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/9099) with worker replacing slave in an accurate concise way for testing `mp`. 2. in `distutils.install.finalize_options()` where it said installation options are set here (default directories, etc.) as well as in the helper functions called here (e.g., `finalize_unix()` if unix or `finalize_other()`). Except it used the term `pliant slaves` originally, and now uses the term `helpers`. 3. The README for python building tools, where it changed reference to "buildbot -- Batchfiles for running on Windows ~~buildslaves~~ *buildbot workers*", which is more inline with the terminology buildbot now uses. I would argue the last two were improvements in accuracy and think all three are not worth caring about. The word [master](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/9101/commits/2cdeced797251f218e416c04b31a00ebbac392d3) was additionally changed in five places. Two of which were outright improvements to sloppy documentation where parent or server are clearer terms than "master": * the first example in `gc` talked about examples of `fork` (which before talked of `child process` and `master process`, but now talks of `parent process`, which is the terminology of `man fork` that you learn in an OS class and no longer a mixed metaphor). * "#Force different suites on client and ~~master~~ *server*" followed by unchanged code that reads `client_context.set_ciphers("AES128")` and `server_context.set_ciphers("AES256")`. So now using the same terminology as the code. There's also three examples where I don't think any clarity was gained or lost. * Documentation how `multiprocessing.Pool` will not work in an interactive interpreter where the child processes can't import from `__main__` as it will leave the ~~master~~ *parent* process running. Both terms are accurate (the thing left running is the parent of the child processes in the pool, but it is also the master of the worker processes in the pool). * changing reference to creating "master option mappings" to "main option mappings" in optparse to an internal helper function that creates empty dicts to store option arguments before parsing. * changing reference to "master pattern object" to "main pattern object" in a regex parsing library (sre_parse). Note this has nothing to do with design patterns or a "controlling" pattern object.
I built a tool which reads a text file describing our school's timetables and generates user-friendly tables for each department. Output is generated using Jinja2 templates and there is some interactivity. This all used to be done by hand every semester, now the script runs in seconds and can always be up to date. I also generate iCal files for the lectures. [This](http://chemeng.up.ac.za/timetables/2018/Chemical_Engineering_4_yr/Interactive_web_version.html) is the timetable for our Chemical Engineering department.
I wrote a few nice scripts that manage a templated jsonnet file for our kubernetes. Makes it easier for others to use them. 
I don’t believe I reinvented any wheels, not that there is anything wrong with reinventing wheels. That is how we have the modern wheels. Before I started this project, I chatted with Wes about Arrow and where he wanted to take it. I also looked, on the surface, at arrow code. My understanding of Arrow is the it is designed to be “under-the-hood” for Pandas. It is not designed to be a coherent C++ library. I wanted to library in C++ to be used exclusively in C++ applications. I hope it makes sense 
I didn't say you want to bypass it. I said what you are doing, using automated tools to access a website, is exactly what a captcha is in place to prevent. 
That's cool, any reason you didn't use dynamic DNS? Lot's of services out there that essentially run a script like yours but then automatically update a DNS record.
&gt; Only if you view people's happiness and comfort with the language as "no functional benefit". Software does not have emotions, happiness, comfort. There is no functional change in how a software performs because of what words you use. This change did nothing for Python the language. &gt;I don't think it is fair to discount everyone because they didn't come forward about it fast enough in some way. Then perhaps the backlash to this change should not be discounted and dismissed? &gt;Sure, there is a difference in how often those words are used, but I'd argue that the point stands. No, actually, the point *doesn't* stand. You're relating words used specifically to cause offense to words used to describe a non-offensive software/hardware relationship. That is wrong. &gt;It's not about intent [...] it's about effect. It's about the purposeful misrepresentation of context to further what is actually a political agenda that has zero to do with the quality of code or functionality of the language. It's about shoving a political agenda down the throats of everything without regards to whether the change is even worthwhile. &gt;It sucks for people who have that history and don't want to be reminded of it. Yeah, especially when it's continually drilled into them "slave is bad word! master is bad word! context doesn't matter! you should feel bad about this!" &gt;I think we should be mindful of our analogies and try to avoid anything that could be harder for someone to deal with You mean like referencing the Holocaust in a gross display of exaggeration? Yeah, maybe we *should* be mindful of our analogies.

A script to compare a set of announced SQL queries, with the executed queries. At my job theres some demanding record keeping requirements, so cyber security and a few managers have to check that there are no naughty SQL queries being slipped in between announced ones. This was outsourced to my department. Used to be, that was 2-12 queries. Now we're getting 2000-20000. I don't think it's actually possible to compare them manually.

Here's another one, this was one of my first ever Python scripts. A client of mine had a website with a hundred odd of science apps. Each app had maybe around 100+ lines of code and every apps JavaScript was in line in the middle of the HTML. When I came round to creating a new site I was going to need to move all the apps and their code into the new HTML page templates. I wrote a script that parsed all the HTML files in a directory, and searched for a regex string. Looked for all the code within \`&lt;script&gt;\` tags with something like \`&lt;script .\*?&gt;(.\*?)&lt;\\/script&gt;\` and printed all the JS to a file with each script under the filename it was pulled from. From there it was easy to make JS files for each script. In hind site I could have written them directly to their own JS files, and saved myself another job... Here's the script I used: [https://github.com/sarcoma/regex-scraper](https://github.com/sarcoma/regex-scraper) I haven't used it since though, not sure it still works.
Hah! This is cool.
Unless I do a straightforward title I tend to put the entire question as the title 
If you read the issue you’d see that they aren’t trying to purge the terminology, they are trying to avoid it where it makes sense to do so. There are plenty of places in the code that still use it because not doing so would be impractical.

Well, computers have come a long way... What are you tapping on anyway, an old Tandy? 
If I had a dollar for every time my commit message was inaccurate or incomplete or just flat wrong. "Fixing tests" should be "breaking everything, but at least trying". The reason was the reason and they said it. You think another reason would be a stronger reason, but that wasn't their reason.
&gt;My office have a dynamic IP and sometimes I want to work in remote using the laptop of my office so I have an script that checks every morning the IP and if it's different from the last IP it sends me an email with the new IP otherwise do nothing xD Cool idea - maybe you could take it a step further and have it modify your hosts file automatically, so you never have to think about it.
So here is my recent little automation project: Age of Empires 2 HD now works out-of-the box in Linux with Steam. To run it, however, one must rename the game exe file to Launcher.exe because the launcher is incompatible to WINE and Steam only triggers the launcher when you press "play". This has to be re-done after every update. I have 9 machines with AoE2 HD on them here at home, since I regularly host LAN parties. So yeah, I wrote a short python script that finds out the path of the AoE2 executables on the current machine, renames the old launcher and moves the game executable to Launcher.exe.
Not every change is an improvement. 
Their stated reason for many of these changes is unnecessarily political. The reason they looked at that section of code is certainly political, but the actual change itself doesn't have to be. So basically they just made things harder for themselves than they need to. 
Nice I just wrote this in bash last week. I want to write a python version as well just to see the difference.
I.. uh.... cheated on my math homework.... *shhhhhhhhhh*
They were also making a statement. It's not political to be sensitive to racial issues. It's just being a considerate person. Nobody's perfect, but we should try. Since you brought it up, getting into recent US politics, it's not political to say Nazis are bad.

&gt; Did you have any coding knowledge prior I had read 60% of "Learning Python" by Mark Lutz but though it is comprehensive, I wanted to just make something. I also obviously did the Google / YouTube stuff. So I then made my first program detailed in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9cfcmp/my_first_program_new_to_coding_time_tracker_for/). It's improved now since then. eg buttons change depending on what options are relevant, but most significantly I also built in Matplotlib to do live pop-up reports in. [Here's an image](https://imgur.com/a/egGdwJL) of it with the report popped up (covering up the confidential stuff):

A script, triggered by cron every night, that updates an AWS SG with a specific list of IP addresses that I retrieve. Next step is turning it into Lambda function and ditching the cron thing all together.
I created a script that keeps track of inventory both physical and online based on what we shipped out via quickbooks. Before I created the script nobody was notified product was low/out until we were already out which set us back in orders. After creating it though none of the front desk were giving me invoices to add to the stock and people from other stores kept taking products to bring to their store without telling anyone. Needless to say it's not working the way I wanted and I basically scrapped the program

At my work we're attempting to determine the species composition of pollinators visiting a rare plant population using hundreds of hours of video we recorded of the flowers. Manually going through the videos one frame at a time is painfully slow so I'm attempting to use the python bindings of OpenCV to help pull out the pollinators by finding the differences between the current frame and previous ones along with some machine learning to check if the detected difference is in fact a pollinator. I haven't gotten it all working yet, but if I do, it could save us countless hours of work for the remainder of the project lifetime.

Okay pretty nice community, not toxic at all. 
loading test databases and now reporting. It has been a nice road!
We needed to pull a report from our project management software's database to get metrics about our projects. I created a Dockerized Flask application that grabs that data on a schedule using Celery and Celery-Beat and displays it all nice using the Datatables Javascript library. Also has a route to download the raw file. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions about Celery. Not an expert, but it was a little tricky to get started.
At work, we have regular deployments to AWS Lambda. There is a 75 GiB limit to the amount of code per lambda can hold. I wrote a script which erases the oldest ten lambda versions to free up space. It runs every three hours.
Because you weren't hand-fed? You're right: No, the community is not toxic.
&gt; Software does not have emotions, happiness, comfort. There is no functional change in how a software performs because of what words you use. This change did nothing for Python the language. People do. Programming languages are not consumed by computers, they are consumed by people. If no one is writing code in your programming language, it's useless. &gt; Then perhaps the backlash to this change should not be discounted and dismissed? Who is doing that? I'm not discounting it, I'm explaining why it's a valuable change. &gt; No, actually, the point doesn't stand. You're relating words used specifically to cause offense to words used to describe a non-offensive software/hardware relationship. That is wrong. Except those words do cause offence or discomfort to some people. Just because you don't find them offensive doesn't make them totally unoffensive. &gt; It's about the purposeful misrepresentation of context to further what is actually a political agenda that has zero to do with the quality of code or functionality of the language. It's about shoving a political agenda down the throats of everything without regards to whether the change is even worthwhile. What political agenda? Letting people feel comfortable while working with the language is not misrepresenting anything or being political. &gt; Yeah, especially when it's continually drilled into them "slave is bad word! master is bad word! context doesn't matter! you should feel bad about this!" That isn't the point, I have explained this repeatedly - it's about the effect it has on people who are reminded of something historically terrible. Why use the word "slave" to describe something when there are other words that won't be an issue? &gt; You mean like referencing the Holocaust in a gross display of exaggeration? Yeah, maybe we should be mindful of our analogies. I wasn't exaggerating - I was making a point. The Holocaust killed fifteen to twenty million people, depending on your counts, the Transatlantic slave trade killed six million and enslaved ten million. I'm not trying to equate them, but they are - without question - both horrific examples of human suffering. To say that one is reasonable to reference while the other isn't is unreasonable. Yes, people use "slave" more commonly, but that doesn't make it right, any more than if terms referencing the holocaust were in common use and someone said "well, they don't mean it as a direct reference". Gas chambers don't *have* to be a direct reference to the holocaust, but they hold that meaning to a lot of people, and understandably people can find it uncomfortable. The same being true of slavery is not unreasonable, it's just not an experience you share. This all boils down to your belief that this isn't real in some way, and that it's "political" - we are talking about making the language nicer to use for some people - why stand in the way of that?

Absolutely. I know this. But I am learning new things on the way. So I am ok with it. Thanks 
I needed to fit backups in the best possible way so i wrote a program to sort it out. It's a really simple algorithm but works quite well. You just sort by filesize descending and then walk over a set of buckets to put them in until they are full. If it won't fit you create a new bucket. This way all the bigger files will be spread out and the rest of the space will be filled with the smaller ones. I got the idea from the zipsplit tool which does the same thing but for zip files.
I really like this attitude. If no one ever dared to reinvent the wheel, things get stagnant. Sure, it might be inefficient on the larger scale of society, but it pays off later. You get new skills that would otherwise fade. Existing tools get some competition (friendly or otherwise), and generally speaking, the state of software is improved.
I did not say you're a nazi...i said it's not political to care about racial issues.
Could you please share the source? Would love to take a look and see where and what I can improve.
Yes CSV. Dealing with data for computing and graphing becomes much easier with CSV .
I've been trying to port princurve from R to python. No native python implementation exists. The purpose is to automate fitting arbitraty lines to collections of GPS points. Useful for creating roads or paths from GPS data that is unevenly spaced, or has multiple passes. Previously, we'd have to do this manually in some GIS software, clicking to create paths.
Haha yep purist to the fullest degree 
I am a civil engineer, and use it as often as I can to automate tasks. I just used python and the xlwings library to make a spreadsheet that calculates stream restoration credits. It reads output files and turns a task that previously took 3 to 4 hours into a half hour task. It took a couple of days to produce, but the typical project probably has this process repeated a total of 5-10 times, so the payoff was very quick. In the past six months I have also used python to automate the output tables that we have in our reports by reading hydraulic models (HEC-RAS) and converting it to a docx table. Also used python to clean LandXML surface files where one piece of software reads/writes the format slightly differently than our other piece of software. That effort was detailed here [my personal interest blog](http://www.knickknackcivil.com/hacking-landxml.html)
Waste your time somewhere else, troll. Glad you could put "I have nothing relevant to say" into so many words.
Well, you failed reading comprehension on the second line: I believe this is because your computer is only able to load that many characters. I am really struggling to think of any other reason... But, yeah, for people like you, a text editor limited to 80 characters would probably be an asset.
That's my goal too! I recently got involved with the test automation team at work and have been writing some automated tests in selenium with Python. I feel like I'm using just enough python to tease me and I want more. So, I'm setting out to find more efficient ways of doing things python in order to become more proficient!
Cabanza, I just posted a topic on reddit about using xlwings. The link to the blog post is here - [http://www.knickknackcivil.com/python-excel.html](http://www.knickknackcivil.com/python-excel.html). Hope its helpful!

My company has tons of tedious work required by project managers. For one project, a PM needed to check-in around 2000 jobs via a gui/web app. So I wrote some python to read a csv and check in all the jobs via selenium. Saved about 30 hours, and it's been used for many other similar projects now.

As all things should be.
&gt;Do you think that we could frame this such that it isn't about you at all? It's not, for the record. Sure: "So then why should Python developers and maintainers be held responsible for people being upset over something that doesn't matter, *especially* when that is not the intent nor the context?" &gt; Are you genuinely suggesting that the PSF is promoting racial division with this change? Could you elaborate more on that? I'm saying the excessive ignoring of context is promoting an irrational emotion-based focus on *appearance* rather than *content*. By "hurting the healing", I mean this effort is jumping on a bandwagon to push an agenda. It is political pandering. 
Oh okay, from what I read online, the python code has to be compiled to JavaScript before it becomes a plug-in. Is that true?
I do a lot of DNA sequencing, and the organization through which I do it posts each result in a file that you have to download separately. They also give it an ID that is different from the ID that you submitted your sample with. I wrote a script that downloads all of the samples and renames them with the ID that you gave them upon submission. It's saved me hours of time.

I "automated" checking O365/Outlook calendar with a python script to poll the API and update my local remind based calendar.

It's on github if anyone else hates Outlook as much as I. https://github.com/eikenb/ihol
So you call your code with f2format /path/to/my/script.py ??? It doesn't seem worth it to me! f-strings look great but there are other backports of f-strings that are just a slight modification rather than the same code with a new executable. Seems much hard to distribute the code, more error prone, and future-fragile to me.
My situation is pretty simple. It’s just an input queue and an output queue, and each thread will take a file name from the input, process that file, and put the extracted data in the output queue. The main thread handles filling the input queue beforehand and emptying the output queue afterwards, so I don’t really have any places where an explicit lock is needed, except potentially printing status information. Would asyncio simplify this?
Microsoft is a silly place.

If you're using a bleeding-edge version of Python, you could use data classes for something like this. I tend to use NamedTuple's and plain functions for classes that just hold data.
In reflection... I would probably just watch YouTube videos from Corey or Schafer or Sentex, cover the basics, run a little personal attempt after each video and then after just the basics are covered, think of a really simply project to make and then google your way through to making it work, then just try adding bits too it. The book is good, but to paraphrase someone else I read, it’s like trying to learn the whole dictionary before learning to speak a language. I will definitely go back to it but my learning has been much faster this way. Also, it turns out using tkinter is surprisingly easy so if you wrap a program in that it will give you a real motivation boost seeing something real (well, more than command line stuff). Also, the community is really helpful. 
* you don’t need the semicolons * you can loop over collections like this: ``` for stuff in collection: stuff.do_stuff() ``` So that you don’t need to mess with `for i in range(len(collection))`. 
What do you mean by bleeding-edge? (sorry lol)
Like Python 3.7 or higher
You can also make use of the __str__ magic method to return the string representation of the object, rather than call the function every time, you can just print the object! Very useful and pythonic :)
Honestly, mostly “how to automate the boring stuff” and just practicing with little snippets using the console. Then progressing to larger projects. 
Have you looked into the pickle module?
Greaet start! Some general recommendations: * Call your class `StudentInfo` and your method `display_info` (see [PEP 8][1]) * Call your objects `raheem`, `phineas`, `oliver`, and `hasnat` (same reference) * Call your first argument to methods `self`, not `student` [1]: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
I haven’t gotten to this point yet but how do you automate a python script to run?
Well done :) 
Write a script to do that
Do tell 
 nested_list = [[(0, 500), (755, 1800)], [2600, 2900], [4900, 9000], [(11000, 17200)]] dm1_list = [] for i in nested_list: for l in i: if type(l) == tuple: templist = list(l) dm1_list.append(templist) else: dm1_list.append(nested_list[nested_list.index(i)]) print(dm1_list) It gets your expected output. If anyone has any criticism/improvements, please tell me.
&gt; It's not a difference between advanced and beginner. I think what happened is that you came from a Matlab background. Matlab is dying. Everyone is now coming from a Python background or an R background. Admittedly it is true that I have learnt MATLAB before Python, simply because I started doing scientific computing more or less at the same time as scientific Python started becoming "a thing". In my field it is more or less impossible to avoid MATLAB (old scripts are too pervasive) but my approach to it is to write anything substantial in C against their C-API... that should give you an idea of my appreciation of MATLAB's architecture, or lack thereof. As for people's background, I guess https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/12014#issuecomment-418580330 https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/11557#issue-337861947 https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/8599#issue-227309236 https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/6321#issuecomment-421203542 don't count? (Yeah, we get complaints from Excel users too.) &gt; add_subplot is bad because it forces the user to repeat the grid dimensions each time. That is mixing two operations: creating the grid, and defining the subplot boundaries. The one-based indexing is just the cherry on top of bad design. (etc.) That's why we also have plt.subplots(). Which, I think, is even more convenient than add_subplot, does not suffering from the bad design of it, and is simpler than GridSpec for the most common case. &gt; It's not "advanced users" that I want to help. It's about making matplotlib Pythonic. This is what this giant reddit post of complaints is about. matplotlib has a terrible interface. Being old is not an excuse. numpy is old. They did a pretty good job. matplotlib hangs on to bad design for some reason. Again, you're welcome to submit PRs. But see the next point. &gt; You don't need to do the work. You just need to write the TODOs and let the work get done by other people. People are upset enough at the interface that they will fix things for you if they believe that their PRs will be accepted. &gt; I'm sorry, but I don't see how you can justify this. You could just as easily have replaced the pyplot stateful module (and its ridiculous use directive) with a Plot object (and a regular constructor). That's what should have happened, and it can still happen if you allow people to contribute that. In case you are wondering: I wrote https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/9795 / https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11581 / https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11600 which took more than a year and three iterations to get merged, to sanitize a bit the situation around `matplotlib.use`. Sometimes a bit of appreciation for other people's work would be nice. Having a Plot() object doesn't actually work so well once you realize that terrible things happen if you try to start both a Qt and a Tk event loop in the same Python program. So there's a reason why the backend is fundamendatlly a singleton. (Sure, you can have singleton objects. But then that's not much better to stick it at the module level...) Also, a lot of the contorsions arose from the fact that there is a tight integration of Matplotlib's event loop with IPython (in fact very old versions of IPython basically started as an interactive shell for Matplotlib). Breaking integration with old versions of IPython would be a lot of fun too. But another reason why the PR took so long to get in is that the number of people who are familiar with any given part of Matplotlib's internals is probably around 10 (for the easier parts) or 1 (for the harder ones). So if you want to familiarize yourself with them -- given that you seem to have a strong opinion on how things should be done -- you're more than welcome to join. &gt; Just make these things objects. They're just as practical, and they're much easier to understand. Presumably, it could be a subobject of the Axes object. They are, they're the prop_cycle and friends.
Could you give an example please?
I wrote a script which daily time logs in jira against my inprogress story.
Are you a spy?? 
Possiblyyyyyy I might also just be a lazy maths student
FIGHT
 from functools import reduce def flatten_to_couples(p, c): if isinstance(c, (list, tuple)) and not isinstance(c[0], (list, tuple)): return p + [list(c)] else: return reduce(flatten_to_couples, c, p) y = [[(0, 500), (755, 1800)], [2600, 2900], [4900, 9000], [(11000, 17200)]] print(reduce(flatten_to_couples, y, [])) 
Basically it just had to do with how binomial distribution could be used to predict the possible outcomes of flipping n coins 2^n times. Another problem though was that sometimes my teacher actually wanted it to be a different number of times, so I had to figure out another number to multiply by 2^n to get the total amount of flips, and then use that number for the binomial distribution..... it’s just tedious stuff. I basically just used it to generate an accurate sample instead of sitting there flipping 240 coins at 9pm. But the important part is that it sorted all the data for me, so I just had to copy it down. 🤫 Sadly it was a one-off type of assignment but I’m learning java so I also did it in java and I also did it in TI-BASIC for my calculator. I ended up spending hours to get it to work on the other two, but it really made me understand why Python is generally used for data and stuff.

I'm going to use Urwid to create the interface. I'll throw in a web server as an extra interface for some of the other features I'm going to add. It would be cool to add a forum and maybe some basic social networking. If it's not too hard I want to make it federated. If I can do that it would be really cool.

A very dumb-level script that save me so much time: I read a lot for my job, and I take a lot of notes, I often copy and paste some quotes. But in some PDF, when you do that, you text get split by carriage returns, so I made a script to solve that. &amp;#x200B; I made another related script that takes all the url stored in a txt file, and download the websites as a PDF. It's much faster than printing these pages one by one in PDF. 
B fucking A!
`def __str__(self):` `return` `student.name` By defining the above example in your class, calling print() on an instance of studentInfo would actually display the student's name instead of just the instance. You could tweak the return value to include whatever info you would want the print call to spit out, essentially doing the work of your `displayInfo()` method. Then instead of calling `students[i].displayInfo()`, you could just `print(students[i])`.
You'll get nothing but grief for using them in python. &amp;#x200B; I wouldn't say "you don't need the semicolons", I would say "do not use the semicolons".
I inherited lab infrastructure from a group that no longer works for my company. Supposedly the switch configurations in the lab were being backed up at some point, using tftp. I found the archive (most from 5+ years ago), and it didn't seem like the script had ran in years. So I decided I'd automate it myself. It went fairly slow at first, because the HP proliant switches add quite a bit of characters and escape characters to the ssh connection, pretty much killing paramiko. I lucked out, and found netmiko, and it works perfectly! Once I got that working, the rest was easy. I now have a cron job that runs every night, checks the switches' configurations vs the last current configs, and archives any changes. Its my second project I've completed at my new position. Starting to feel a little confident in what I can accomplish if I come up with something to automate. I'm a total noober (haven't really coded since college, in the late 90s), but Python makes working through issues, and getting things done easy. Next I'm hoping to figure out how I can utilize power shell to remote into our Windows infrastructure, and do some maintenance. 
I wrote a script to grab switch configuration files and convert the relevant parts to a YAML file for use with Ansible. Now I can import my current infrastructure in preparation of automating my datacenters. The reason I learned Python was to convert a huge firewall configuration to another vendor. The location of the firewall was changing, too, so I had to rewrite all the policies based on full source and destination specifics.
oh I just had to type \_\_str\_\_
So snapshots? That's neat, I wish I had done that for some of the API tests I've written over the years. It's a decent chunk of coverage for little effort.
HAHAHA for x in range() get ready for PHENOMAL COSMIC ITERATION POWERS for s in students: s.attribute
I think I would understand it better if I just made a function instead of using \_\_str\_\_

Right now im making a web scraper that will automatically gather, keep track and update the titles and urls of any Youtube playlist . I have plans to automate it further to use a 3rd party youtube to mp3 converter to also convert and download mp3's from the playlist, which will also run through checks to keep it updated. (ik this is probably in the grey side of web scraping legality, im just making it purely for practice.)
That's fair enough because we all work things out in our own way, but IMHO getting comfortable with the magic methods is a pretty high priority for a Python learner.
How do you schedule when it runs? 
For interactive plots I've used Chaco in the past. It was better designed for event-driven software than matplotlib.
Literally in the same boat. Ive been learning it by finding certain projects/things i could do with coding and just research on the web and youtube how i would go at it, step by step :p
Nothing short of exceptional! Trio should be the official async library in Python.
we use a Nortel PBX for phones , script to log in with pyexpect get IP addresses of all the connected IP phone on one of the company sites and then using curses show a dashboard of red and green indicators for each of the 98 phones as they are pinged on a regular basis. also has command keys for showing further details about each individual phone. IP, TN, DN etc... not quite complete yet but 90% done :)

A program that logs on to all our Cisco routers via Jenkins and collects routing information of all devices, all vrfs and all bgp info Then pushes it to gitlab and compare the changes, which are sent via email We now have our routing changes in source control, which helps a lot when you act as an isp
Hate to seem helpless, but could you summarize what parts are java-oriented? I was hoping to use this as a "python from a java perspective" resource as someone trying to move from python to java.
Django front end with postgres database at the back to connect to 30+ ( multiprocessing to do them all in as short a time as possible) power meters in datacentre over internet gateway for modbus with 600+ connected circuits to record power consumption of each circuit every 15 minutes. Django produces graphs of usage over time and 'heat maps' of the room for racks consuming the most power, also show usage stats between two dates for historical analysis and future planning. Took me about 3 months, saved the company $45K or so. The company that was bidding for the job was going to give us a free desktop to run their software on! Generous of them. 
Are you aware of a tool that converts python to lisp?
I am just using tkinter for now to get the functions working but will likely switch to something a bit more aesthetically pleasing. I'll check out pyqt!
Since I'm the only one who uses Python at work, I have to turn it into an exe file &amp; use the Windows Task Scheduler.
I also did something similar for client updates, if possible could you elaborate on the office politics? they decided not to use mine due to privacy &amp; unethical issues?? (i know right!)
I wrote a script to get some metrics that management likes to see and convert them to matplotlib graphs. They had a dude doing the graphs by hand every so often, now it's completely automated. 
I wrote a script that will pull a list of IP addresses from a MySQL database. Once the IPs have been pulled the script will connect to IPs via netmiko (with Threading) perform show interfaces. Parse the show interfaces var with testFSM into json. I then convert from JSON to CSV and import all interface information back into MySQL. It was a great learning project. 
Depending on OS, cron job or task scheduler.
Ah yeah, python has so many tricks and efficiencies built in. Here is a couple changes to your code that I made just for fun with a couple tricks I've picked up. Not saying this is right and yours in is wrong. Just wanted to demonstrate a couple possibilities. class Student: all_students = [] def __init__(self, name, year, form, form_tutor): self.name = name self.year = year self.form = form self.form_tutor = form_tutor self.all_students.append(self) def display_info(self): for k, v in self.__dict__.items(): print("{}: {}".format(str(k).title().replace('_', ' '), str(v).title())) print() Student("Raheem", 11, "11L", "Mrs Halai") Student("Phin", 11, "11K", "Mrs Power") Student("Oliver", 11, "11B", "Mr Rugooba") Student("Hasnat", 11, "11K", "Mrs Power") for s in Student.all_students: s.display_info() 
There's also monit which is pretty sweet albeit not quite as pretty as Grafana
Bit different from most folks here, but have a raspberry pi that uses an IR beam break sensor to count revolutions of a mouse running-wheel and keeps a timestamped log of average speed, total speed, runtime, etc. I set it up to auto-save log files every hour. Also worked in an onboard UPS that can automatically save any open files and shut down safely on power failure, and reboot/re-initialize acquisition programs when power is restored. There is a simple text-based UI I made using curses to allow for configuration and initialization of capture. The plan is just to get these running and check on them every once in a while with little USB powered (5", 5V, 500mA) screen that can be carried into the facility and moved between cages as needed. The animals being monitored with this device are stored in a secure barrier facility with backup generators, etc. Shouldn't be any power issues, but the 'consumables' in these experiments (e.. novel compounds only produced in one-off batches by companies all over the world, genetically engineered mice that are used as models for human disease) can be quite expensive. Wouldn't want to have to repeat experiments because we are unsure what happened due to a power failure or anomaly. &amp;#x200B; The alternative is to pay our the nose for a commercial system that requires expensive custom PCI cards, an older version of windows (where can you even get windows 7 these days?), an expensive software license (that has to be renewed yearly), and a ridiculous custom running wheel that is WAY over-engineered. Or use a hall-effect sensor from a bike computer and log the average speed once every 24 hours. I feel like this is analogous to going car shopping and finding out you can only but a Ferrari or a unicycle. I like to think my solution falls into the 'Toyota Camry' region of the spectrum. The biomedical world is generally lacking people who can develop their own instrumentation. Companies prey on them selling crazy overpriced devices that haven't been upgraded in any meaningful way since 2004. 
Snapshotting VMs in VMware Vcenter is a slow, tedious task, so I made a page with Flask/Pyvmomi that allows you to snapshot multiple machines at once and allows you to delete several at once too. In fact I'm recreating a lot of Vcenter functions because it's so bloated.

cron job just and watch out the path on it 
&gt; What's your field? In mine, MATLAB is dead. I don't even think they're renewing the licenses anymore. Single-molecule biophysics &amp; microscopy. MATLAB is very much alive in this field (much to my despair). &gt; Great, so I think you should push subplots for the common case and GridSpec for the complex case. https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10865 https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11619 &gt; I meant to talk about how matplotlib can move forward with a good design. Thanks. &gt; Out of curiosity, what goes wrong if someone tries to start both event loops? They both try to set the (single, process-level-global) PyOS_InputHook which controls what happens with user input. &gt; I think there's still a way to do this with objects. I assume you're starting the event loop on pyplot.show. If pyplot were an object, you could just start and stop the event loop in a context manager like Plot.event_loop. I.e., something like (etc) Again: for non-interactive backends there is no input hook so there isn't much of a point. For interactive backends, (even assuming that GUI toolkits clean up properly themselves after shutting down their event loop, which I don't even *know* how to do with PyQt for example) what exactly is the use case where you'd want to start both a Qt event loop and a GTK one? (practicality, purity, yada yada) In practice starting a GUI single event loop and allowing switching to non-interactive backends covers all realistic cases I can think of, and my PRs mentioned above just do that. &gt; Why do you care about old versions of IPython? As soon as numpy drops Python 2 support next year, I imagine you'll do the same? That would be a good time to drop support for old IPython. mpl3 (due to be released very soon, the rcs are already out) already drops support for Py3. I personally don't care about old versions (I run Arch Linux so everything's at the latest version anyways), but consider for example the fact that neither ipython nor matplotlib actually depend (in the setuptools sense) on each other, nor do we even want to import one another to check the other's version. So essentially we'd be in a situation where if someone has incompatible versions of ipython and matplotlib installed, things would just randomly break (probably somewhere around the event loop, so it's asynchronous code which is even more confusing (not in the sense of asyncio)). Considering the *huge* number of beginners (e.g. data science classes) with random versions of ipython and matplotlib installed, that's not doing a service for them (again, I invite you to look around the tracker or stackoverflow to get an idea of the user population). Would this be better handled if there was better packaging tooling to impose version compatibility constraints, *and* if ipython and matplotlib's dev teams were closely coordinating their releases? Perhaps. But this is not the case right now. &gt; I will be glad to help up, but I have to believe that my time writing PRs is going to be worthwhile and they're going to improve matplotlib. I've contributed to a lot of Python projects in the past. Well, I can't guarantee we'll accept your PRs (that's just not how things work anywhere in open source development AFAIK :-)) but we'll consider them. (It is true that we have hundreds of open PRs awaiting a decision, so you can always ping back if yours fall between the cracks.) &gt; Right, and I see you've put that on the backend. I get it, but if the backend had been an object, this would all make more sense. No, it lives on the *Axes* object. Which is an object :p

You can use praw to scrape comments from a post so yea, not hard
Can you elaborate on task scheduler? In practice you schedule the opening of the python script?
It's a one way relationship. Most every Point of Sale system is going to be a POS in every sense, though not every piece of POS software will be for point of sales. 
I work for a Telco and made a script that will help collect out from executed commands for each specified NE in the network. This is done before and after configuration changes are made, then the pre/post check is compared for differences and displayed in a nice format to the implementer. This is to help the implementer figure out if any routes/neighbours are missing, interfaces are down, CPU/memory too high etc.. gives them better visibility of the result so they can roll back if needed.
Yes, *some* people of color (and some non-PoC) have complained and I am not trying to say they don't have those feelings. But I also know other PoC who don't find the terminology objectionable (especially say using 'master' alone -- 5 of the 8 changes, in cases like a master list of options). Similarly people here have loudly complained that the terminology isn't offensive and take offense at changing terminology. I would agree if the changes broke code and presented lots of maintenance work for end-users that it would not be worth it. Like if [linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/search?q=slave&amp;unscoped_q=slave) tried to do the same thing, but in publicly used code where the changes broke lots of things for end-users. The terminology is a well-established technology definition (that isn't slang/jargon) and also point out that slavery is broader than American slavery that was primarily of captured Africans (and their descendants). Modern slavery affects all races as both slave owner and slave. It isn't being used for offensive reasons and isn't promoting or making light of slavery (any more than `kill` promotes violence).

`__str__` would _be_ a function (just like `__init__` is). These specially-named "dunder" (double underscore) methods are used in specific, helpful ways.
trio does look like a better solution than asyncio, but sadly it isn't compatible with the current async libraries like aiohttp. It makes it not very useful.

Ok I havent learned these things yet, I am still in the stage of learning and making things that really boil down to toys/trinkets, havent really put any python to work yet

Hey there! Joseph here (other owner). We will have a repository which will contain our task when it is released, and you can see previous tasks as well in our GitLab group for code jams: https://gitlab.com/python-discord/code-jams.
Weee. Thanks for hosting this event! Looking forward to it :)
&gt; MATLAB is very much alive in this field (much to my despair). Well, we have the same interest then: get matplotlib and numpy to a point where no one considers MATLAB. &gt; https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/10865 &gt; https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/11619 Excellent! At some point, it would be nice to link to GridSpec from the `add_subplots` documentation so that people discover this. &gt; They both try to set the (single, process-level-global) PyOS_InputHook which controls what happens with user input. I see. This is unfortunately poor design from PyQt. They should not have been setting that when QtCore is imported. They should have made a context manager that essentially does this: @contextmanager def pyqt_input_hook(): pyqtRestoreInputHook() # Actually just set it. try: yield finally: pyqtRemoveInputHook() and then in your code, you could wrap your main window with that input hook. Anyway, now that they've done this, I can see how it encourages you to also have a stateful design. &gt; Again: for non-interactive backends there is no input hook so there isn't much of a point. For interactive backends, (even assuming that GUI toolkits clean up properly themselves after shutting down their event loop, which I don't even know how to do with PyQt for example) what exactly is the use case where you'd want to start both a Qt event loop and a GTK one? (practicality, purity, yada yada) Am I right that for non-interactive backends, you could have replaced the stateful library with a regular object? If so, that removes a major use of the stateful library. I understand you put a lot of effort into the switch_backend function. However, there's a way of slowly moving towards a stateless library. As for the interactive backends, I like your summary that it's a question of practicality versus purity. In this case, it's just one extra context manager or constructor when using an interactive backend. In my eyes, that's not that impractical, but I can see how that could be annoying in ipython. There's gotta be a nice compromise. Maybe statefulness is the nicest solution for interactive backends. It's definitely the status quo, so it wins there. I think matplotlib tries to be too terse. For example, you are lazily grabbing the event loop when a figure is created. Why not just be explicit--then you'll also catch the errors related to that sooner, and it'll be less confusing when there are errors because they'll be on the context manager rather than on the figure creation? &gt; but consider for example the fact that neither ipython nor matplotlib actually depend (in the setuptools sense) on each other, nor do we even want to import one another to check the other's version. So essentially we'd be in a situation where if someone has incompatible versions of ipython and matplotlib installed, things would just randomly break Good point. That's really unfortunate for you guys. It must be very frustrating to have to support old versions. At some point, it might make sense to come up with a way to check at runtime if the ipython is compatible (maybe in the `%matplotlib` magic command?). If there is no nice way to do that, then is there a PEP that fixes this? I'm an idealist. There has to be a way to verify compatibility so that you don't have to keep supporting ten-year-old code. &gt; Well, I can't guarantee we'll accept your PRs (that's just not how things work anywhere in open source development AFAIK :-)) but we'll consider them. Thanks, and of course you don't have to guarantee anything, but it's nice to have a roadmap of what you want to do so that the design questions are sorted out *before* the PR. Design first, review the design, then implement, then code review. Right? &gt; No, it lives on the Axes object. Which is an object :p Excellent. That makes perfect sense.
I would switch out your api token to a random string before posting code snippets...
Instead of using sleep, you can loop looking for an element that would be loaded on the page and break the while loop after it is found. That way you can look 20 times a second or so instead of hard coding an x second sleep in.
Hey this is my time to shine. Work basically as an automation engineer for a fortune 500 company. My work is on the admin side so my day to day is basically automating tasks for accountants, lawyers, auditors, logistics people, taxation people, basically anyone on the admin side of things. Main tools I work with are selenium, pandas, tkinter and pywinauto. This year I set up a (fairly tedious) automation platform for internal audit. It's expected to save about ~3000 man hours per year. Happy to answer questions if anyone has one. 
Noted. Thanks Andrew!
If ur a Linux library developer, u shalt have the demand :) And I have to reaffirm that `f2format` should work as a pre-distribution hook; it’s to let u write *f-string*s in ur dev codes, and leave the back-port issues for dist with itself. Check out the distro demo [automator](https://github.com/JarryShaw/f2format/blob/master/release.sh) for a better understanding of how it should work.

scikit-learn, numpy, tensorflow, pytorch. It all depends on what kind of model you want to build.
Unfortunately, Miles no longer works there. Quite a while back he was... *[Puts on mirrored Oakleys]* ...terminated. 
Interesting to have built it yourself. The company I work at now is a huge enterprise level company and I got the job over another more qualified on paper candidate because I told them about how I built my own, relatively simple, engine for logging visitors to my portfolio site. They use an incredible array of tools, both internally built and sourced externally, to achieve various business goals and logging data is a primary business focus. &amp;#x200B; In short, keep on doing what you're doing! Exploring and learning is the heart of being a software engineer.
use the book as a starter, its so easy to learn and watch a few basic videos online about python - honestly, its easier than you think but the book has some easy and simple ideas
how did you display it in a nice format? did you use a GUi or just had graphs in excel?
I was hooked by the one on memory management—I was just thinking that I need to learn more about that. Thanks for sharing!
Essentially yes, as APIs are intended to be the same each time so you can just snapshot it once, verify it manually, and then automatically do it after that. Though I do some custom stuff like having it fail if it takes over 50% longer than the first time.
I use a template script that I came up with for deploying diagnostic software to USB for service reps. It's templated such that in about a half hour to an hour you can customize it to deploy any of our custom software. I also automate pulling out data from a database that I have to access regularly. Also automated is updating that database. I rewrote that script from batch to python. A few teething problems initially but my colleagues are now quite thankful. I've also convinced our group to use python exclusively for scripts unless they can specifically justify using batch (admittedly there are some valid use cases batch).

Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!

From the GitHub page: Authentication Soundcloud has banned all our client_id so we cannot use authentication for now. When I run: python3 setup.py install I get: error: Could not find suitable distribution for Requirement.parse('clint')
I can run youtube-dl from the command line on osx. Could you give me a ELI5 on how to utilize this script? Thank You!
I know some will think I'm nit picking a technicality, but it it's important to me that we recognize that slavery is **not** abolished in the U.S. It is explicitly preserved in the thirteenth amendment, and actively employed in reality.
I wrote a quick script to check when a site is down and notify me with a ding when it comes back up again. Useful for random outages of our project management, email, whatever, etc.
&gt;exceptional I see what you did there.
Would you mind defending that last bit? I want to clarify that we are talking about involuntary servitude where *no* capital in any form is gained, no ownership is given, disenfranchisement is a present, agency is denied, and leaving is not an option. I want to delineate from the economically-disinclined, which is not the same thing. 
That’s a great one. And often times overlooked by Python developers. Glad you liked the list!
Awesome, now I just need to learn how to move from the stupid async sleep examples everyone posts to building actual applications!
I am using "difflib.Differ().compare(pre_check, post_check)" from the difflib library (https://docs.python.org/3/library/difflib.html). It shows the user exactly which field/value was changed. Also use a for loop to just output the changed lines rather than a full output comparison, but i still need to implement ordering for the loop. with open('diff.txt', 'w') as diff: for line in post_check: if line not in pre_check: diff.write('[BEFORE] {}\n'.format(line)) for line in pre_check: if line not in post_check: diff.write('[AFTER] {}\n'.format(line))
Tkinter itself is already pretty high-level. What more are you looking for?
&gt; I might actually start using it You know that's a big complement and motivation! I'll try to implement the user system ASAP so the site will be actually usable!
I've only used `asyncio` along with `aiohttp`. What makes `trio` better?
Me too. Exactly 0
Thanks for this. Makes me believe more in getting hands dirty, rather than only going for out of box solutions.
I believe [trio-asyncio](https://github.com/python-trio/trio-asyncio) is meant to address that gap.
From the README: &gt; Rationale &gt; Trio has native concepts of tasks and task cancellation. Asyncio is based on callbacks and chaining Futures, albeit with nicer syntax, which make handling of failures and timeouts fundamentally less reliable, esp. in larger programs. Thus, you really want to base your async project on Trio. &gt; &gt; On the other hand, there are quite a few asyncio-enhanced libraries. You really don't want to re-invent any wheels in your project. &gt; &gt; Thus, being able to use asyncio libraries from Trio is useful. Trio-Asyncio enables you to do that, and more.
This is very simple and easy to follow thank you!
Pro tip: saying "stupid" doesn't really encourage one to have any meaningful conversation with you. Does rust documentation teach you how to write a web browser, for instance? Unfortunately, asyncio doesn't have batteries for HTTP or interfacing with Rabbitmq, there are libraries built on top of it to do that. I agree that "sleep examples" aren't perfect, and I'd really appreciate if you can suggest us better.
Just spent a little time looking in to fabric. Running commands on all the hosts at once is amazing! I think I am going to make changes to use this. Thank you.
Maybe those devs were using scripts as well but milking the system by making it look like they were copy/pasting? I'm a hobbyist programmer, but some of the first useful things I've learned have been automation/scraping, so how could employed developers not at least know about the concepts, and at least try to implement them?
It's been *extremely* useful to re-invent the wheel in my experience, and once you make your wheel you have many others to compare it to and continue learning from. My biggest pain point was biting more than I can chew and getting discouraged. I agree that your advice is useful after a certain point in terms of experience, but that's for the individual to determine.
Try PySimpleGui. It uses Tkinter and it's super simple to get up and running.
&gt; It's because most of the defectors went back to node. If you're suggesting forks cannot work or be successful, then you aren't at all familiar with the last 30 years of software development. "It didn't work because there was no point in forking but its okay, such non-point forks do indeed work out" And yes, removing words from our vocabulary due to offending some people and others needing to show pious virtues is comparable to 1984. If you can't see that I'm sorry but you need to reread the damned book, and there's no point in going back and forth in a cyclical discussion, so, have a good night.
A web crawler crawling multiple websites and fetching data, also doing some CPU bound tasks and how asyncio run this in Process pool.
How are event loops low level when to do something actually meaningful with coroutines you need to use them? I only wish the coroutine and task cliff was fixed, and default event loops existed, then I'd have to stop writing my wrapper.
If a method is a coroutine it does not automatically mean it's something high-level. Almost all event loop coroutine methods work with transports and protocols and callbacks—something that libraries like asyncpg or sanic take advantage of to be super fast. &gt; stop writing my wrapper I've no idea what your wrapper is, sorry. Care to explain what problems you are trying to solve? We might be able to address them in 3.8.
Yeah, but that would require us to use aiohttp in the official asyncio documentation, which would in turn mean that we are promoting 'aiohttp' heavily and not other libraries. Some people would inevitably think that aiohttp is the only "blessed" library for HTTP, and that's something I'd like to avoid.
Yeah, that might be the case but this is the most common use case everybody can benefit from. Maybe use any other asynchronous http clients if there are any?
&gt; I think you're misunderstanding me. What I mean is, we have multiple concepts of running a coroutine being high level (run, create_task, etc), Yes. &gt; however the event loop itself, which is one of the major ways of executing coroutines Yes, but there are no reasons to use the event loop directly in Python 3.7+ in application-level code. Prior to Python 3.7 there were reasons why people did them, now we are trying to fix that and let 99% asyncio users forget about the loop. &gt; and in fact one that many libraries use and expose to the end user, is documented as low level rather than high level. Reasons for that are historical. This practice will fade away. There are 0 reasons to pass a loop instance to a coroutine: 1. there's only one possible loop you can pass to a coroutine -- the one that is currently running it. 2. you can determine the current event loop with 100% certainty -- by calling asyncio.get_running_loop() So with (1) and (2) in mind there is absolutely no reason for libraries to accept the 'loop' argument anymore. &gt; 1. Tasks and coroutine objects are not the same. You can create a task from a coroutine and await it, but when you create a task the coroutine becomes useless to an extent. Tasks run coroutines; this concept is the same in all Python async frameworks incl asyncio, curio, trio, and twisted. I guess your problem #1 is closely related to your point #3 (in fact you seem to be talking about the same issue in both of them). &gt; Furthermore there isn't much a concept of stateful execution (like in JS, where async functions are backed by promises) this doesn't seem like an actual problem, from the outside looking in, and seeing paradigms in other languages (Ruby, C#, Javascript), it is. What is "stateful execution"? You have local variables in coroutines (local state) and context variables (PEP 567, global per-Task state), as well as global variables. Could you please elaborate (ideally with an example of JS and Py code) what kind of state am I missing? &gt; 2. There isn't a default event loop that is at ready on a separate thread. This may seem useless and unnecessary at first however to an extent there's an expectation that your asynchronous code should be asynchronous from your synchronous code. As in, I should be able to submit a coroutine to an event loop on a separate thread, without the hassle of setting up that event loop. Well, improving threading APIs isn't something we're super focused on right now. The main reason is GIL -- asyncio threads themselves are usually CPU-bound, so there's no point (usually) to run more than one asyncio thread per process. &gt; This idea is prevalent in JS and C# You mean web workers in JS? If so, its not that easy to use them, actually. :) &gt; 3. Calling asynchronous functions should initialize the task. I hear you, but the ship has sailed. Nothing we can do here without breaking virtually all existing code.
Yeah, that would be a great example to show how run_in_executor works/can be used. I'll think about this.
Cool project, thanks for sharing!
Good chat
Of course! Feel free to pm me if you ever have any questions or anything in the future, I love helping out where I can.
This looks awesome. In the last couple of years I've found myself putting together three different python projects that relied on some combination of threads/subprocesses/worker pools, and I felt like old stackoverflow posts were more useful than the official docs when it came to learning how to get things running as intended. These seem easier to navigate/search through, easier to understand, and more useful than most of the other python docs I've had to deal with. It's nice to see people doing something about the state of the official documentation other than complaining about it or just acknowledging that it's a problem!

I was in the marketing Dept and the call center was in the Internal Operations Dept. My friend in that department told me about the situation and I just figured out how to fix it with a csv export from the database, a Python script that reads the export, and then sends out a twilio text. The VP of Marketing tends to bump heads with other departments. The VP of Operations is a hard headed guy and tried to prove a point by saying we don't need your help " I know how to run my Dept".

Ah great idea that way there’s no unnecessary extra delay. I will look to add thanks 
I can think of four that I have made in recent months. 1. A script to change the DNS records of thousands of subdomains due to hosting provider changes, with a second mini script to check the availability of the sites after the change that returned a list of addresses that gave a 40* response (although all subdomains worked well so didn't get any entry on the list). 2. An image downloader for my girlfriend's work (mobile apps development). They had a list (txt file) of all the assets (images) that their apps used but now they wanted to have the images not only the links. Script also returned a txt file with all the links that were dead. Final count: around 600 downloaded images, and about 120 dead links on the list. 3. Image size resizer/compressor. Helpwd with a migration of high quality images to a platform with restriction on both image and file size. The site doesn't have an API so I couldn't upload the images automatically, could have done it in other way but was a quick 10 min. script between normal day tasks and the site has bulk upload so would have spent more time on the solution than the actual "manual" upload. 4. Article translation for zendesk. Built an automatic translator using their API and a Google translate library. Script downloaded all the articles, then translated and added an article translation one by one with a new selected locale. Used to help the expansion of the company in new countries and save time of localization employees by having them just fix the grammar instead of doing the entire article again, and they can spend more time localizing the product/app. I can list the libraries I used on this scripts on the morning if anyone is interested. Loved doing those scripts as Python is my preferred language but my current job uses RoR so it's nice to come back and polish my Python skills. Funny note: for script 2 my girlfriend was tasked to do it as she didn't have a big work assignment at the time, she asked me to do it as she was studying for her master's admission exam, so it was no biggie. Couple of weeks later she was tasked to learn a new testing tool written I Python so she could teach the new (and first) tester when she joined, due to "her proficiency in the language". She was mad she got extra work because of that script and I couldn't stop laughing. 
When you say customers have things I wondered if you were talking about zaps (thinking you worked for Zapier). 
Thank you!
&gt; Excellent! At some point, it would be nice to link to GridSpec from the add_subplots documentation so that people discover this. https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/12114 &gt; Am I right that for non-interactive backends, you could have replaced the stateful library with a regular object? If so, that removes a major use of the stateful library. I understand you put a lot of effort into the switch_backend function. However, I think we could hash out a way of slowly moving towards a stateless non-interactive backends. Even without the non-interactive backends, there are operations where a figure actually *needs* to know how it's going to be rendered. For example, in tight_layout (auto-margins selection), you need to know how big *text* is going to be rendered, and that's going to be different depending on whether you're going to be using LaTeX to render math, on whether you are writing a pdf while restricting yourself to the pdf core fonts (so that you don't have to embed fonts), etc. (Right now if you try to do these without a canvas (more specifically a renderer) attached, we'll complain and say that you need one.) &gt; As for the interactive backends, I like your summary that it's a question of practicality versus purity. In this case, it's just one extra context manager or constructor when using an interactive backend. In my eyes, that's not that impractical, but I can see how that could be annoying in ipython. There's gotta be a nice compromise. Maybe statefulness is the nicest solution for interactive backends. It's definitely the status quo, so it wins there. The underlying GUI library is stateful (as it sets PyOS_InputHook -- as I said it's likely that some of them don't even clean up properly after themselves, not sure though) so that was definitely the path of least resistance. &gt; I think matplotlib tries to be too terse. For example, you are lazily grabbing the event loop when a figure is created. Why not just be explicit--then you'll also catch the errors related to that sooner, and it'll be less confusing when there are errors because they'll be on the context manager rather than on the figure creation? I honestly don't think I understood what you're trying to say here. &gt; Good point. That's really unfortunate for you guys. It must be very frustrating to have to support old versions. At some point, it might make sense to come up with a way to check at runtime if the ipython is compatible (maybe in the %matplotlib magic command?). If there is no nice way to do that, then is there a PEP that fixes this? I'm an idealist. There has to be a way to verify compatibility so that you don't have to keep supporting ten-year-old code. I never said supporting old versions was particularly fun (see the workarounds in the backends-refactor PR and the ensuing whack-a-mole). You are welcome to give it a try if you can think of a better coordination mechansim. &gt; Thanks, and of course you don't have to guarantee anything, but it's nice to have a roadmap of what you want to do so that the design questions are sorted out before the PR. Design first, review the design, then implement, then code review. Right? You can also just post design writeups / proposals to the gitter channel for example (https://gitter.im/matplotlib/matplotlib). We don't bite :) However, I do hope that this discussion has convinced you that many "suboptimal" choices are there for reasons deeper than "we suck at designing a Python library".
Maybe I was being kind calling them devs, perhaps Wordpress coders would be more appropriate. I remember one of them being blown away by the ease with which I could write a for loop...

We had a task that took about a day that I reduced to 20 minutes. It's basically making an excel sheet export of some incidents on a ticketing system and then later taking an edited version of that sheet and building a PowerPoint slide with a very specific formatting. The hardest part was making the PowerPoint as its formatting didn't match a standard template. Luckily the ticketing system had an API I was able to use that no one seemed to know about. I've also created an alert system for work relevant to my team coming in to the ticket system. You can tell what days I work just by looking at average wait time now.

No probem!
stop man, gee. 
I'd use pyside2, but it doesn't uses tkinter as a base.
Except that \`urllib\` is not async, so that doesn't make any sense?
I would love to see `run_in_executor` highlighted in the documentation since given the amount of sync-code, it is often the fastest way to get things done (not perfect, but usually good enough and, definitely, better than a direct blocking call).
Is this for the now defunct Nike watch? If so then I am very interested in doing this myself!
I never understood how asyncio is different from just starting a new thread.
Doing online courses wont have the same effect as going to college. In my opinion, online courses are not even worthy of being put on a CV (unless they are degrees). I had the same dilemma as you before I joined college. I understand that college loans are a big deal but I think going to college is worth it. You improve as a person and a programmer. Have a broader and better understanding of things and develop a method of solving problems. I am thankful that I decided to go to college, it has helped me grow in different fields of CS. Good luck!
This list needs more Raymond Hettinger.
CS is a lot more than programming. Generally we teach programming in the first year and then spend the rest of the time on data structures, algorithms, architecture, operating systems, software engineering, security, AI, data science, and more.
[https://xkcd.com/481/](https://xkcd.com/481/)
Thanks for doing this! In the last couple of weeks I tried to pick up asyncio and I struggled with the documentation. I'll definitely give it another shot, although I'm also spoiled by trio now, so I'm not sure if I'll go back to asyncio. Not that it's that much different, but I found the vocabulary of [trio](https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) much easier to pick up (with my previous async knowledge from C++ asio). 
Think of it as becoming a generalist in CS. A jack of all trades, master of none. So it depends on what you plan on doing in the future. For me personally a CS degree would be a complete waste of time and money and I work in infosec. 
I will play Devil's advocate for both sides here. There are things you can learn through self study that you won't learn in college. I have a pretty successful career in Security and much of it is self taught. I got an 2 year degree in software development focused on Java and yet today most everything I write is in Python, self taught. But, and here is the kicker, if you want to get into software development the you should definitely get a Bachelor's degree. Yes there are some people out there without degrees who have great careers as developers but in most cases you need a 4 year degree. Most employers want to see that on your resume, and some basic CS courses will give you a better foundation, depending on how much effort you put into learning. You can get the same from a 2 year degree but in my experience the development world is run by people who put more weight on 4 year degree than they do experience so just to get past HR, pay for the longer degree. And while in school make sure to build a portfolio. Set up a git repository and put that on your resume. Contrary to what many people say, home projects can count as experience. Some of the best tools out there that I use in the security world were built as home projects.
Thanks, very useful.

That looks great! Will you add [ReadTheDocs](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) documentation?
Whoever facilitated this should get a reward. The previous documentation wasn't even remotely helping me getting started with asyncio and I had to resort to tutorials on the Internet. This one is muuuuch more better! Thanks!
What are you talking about? It has documentation, tests, and the whole structure + bunch of regression/analytical routines implemented. Why being an a\*\*h\*\*\*?
Programming languages are tools. You need the best tool for any given job. Also there is no one tool that fits all.
I have made a page and job counter for a copy/scan machine. It reads the numbers out from the printer over SNMP and displays it in a flask web server which runs locally on a raspberry pi. It saves a ton of time at big complicated jobs as we don't need to manually search for color or duplex pages.

&gt; require stepping forward one line at a time Why would you do this instead of using "Run to Cursor" or breakpoints? &gt; and only step between loop iterations. Again, breakpoints seem perfectly suitable. &gt; You can go back if you accidentally step too far. You can mostly do this using the Frames view in PyCharm's debugger, or are you talking about something else? &gt; You can also instantly see the value of any expression without any copy pasting or typing and without worrying about the side effects of evaluating an expression [Like this?](https://i.imgur.com/DNfxAep.png).
I agree.
That’s pretty much it we have task scheduler open the python script and in certain cases, run in conjunction with macro scripts. 
Very nice!
just practicing for interviews. python is great for getting a solution onto the page quickly - not always very time efficient, though
Isn't music suppose to be designed by humans for humans? cause, I don't see any bonobo playing piano in the forest.
Working on my toy language, powered by Python and LLVM: [https://github.com/syegulalp/Akilang](https://github.com/syegulalp/Akilang) * Improved some of the control-flow logic, for the `break` and `continue` keywords. * Attempting to build a basic Win32 window application, but that's still a ways off. If you're on Windows, you can pull and try out Akilang right now, with some demos (e.g., Conway's Game Of Life). I'm also working on a "Robots" game demo, which is now semi-playable. I also made a short demo movie here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vZ4oFCFOl8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vZ4oFCFOl8)
How is this for humans? Not all people, or musicians, are programmers. &amp;#x200B; Additionally, I recommend a bit more research yourself into music theory. Your response to this issue demonstrate the gulf of knowledge: [https://github.com/kennethreitz/pytheory/issues/6](https://github.com/kennethreitz/pytheory/issues/6)
I'm well aware. But "running theme" has become "running meme".
you can change it and you have been able to for the longest time
&gt; but when you get to a point where you're not sure what you're looking for and you want to watch what happens (e.g. which branches execute), you step forward a line at a time Ah, that makes more sense. &gt; And once you step forwards you can't step backwards. Going up a frame is something else. So you're talking about actually rewinding the stack? So you can continue execution from a previous point? Yea that'd be useful. &gt; I know how to use PyCharm. I wasn't trying to imply otherwise. The way that your comment read(to me) just wasn't really showing how birdseye handled those scenarios differently.
I have had trouble with anaconda sublime plugin lately is there a better plugin to replace this with? Maybe I will give LSP a try. 
¿downvotes? come on, it was funny.
Pytheory is a bad name. Music theory isn't the only kind of theory...

I would not call tkinter high level. Tkinter is a widget library. A GUI Framework provides much more than widgets: MVC, an Application Object, functionalities to perform undo/redo, serialization, menus and Views declaratively.

Ha ha! It was hard to not put all Raymond on there. He has so many good talks out there but I felt it was a little unfair to the others so I limited it to just one per speaker. 
This is something I’ve been wanting to do for a while. Have you found any resources you would recommend?
Thanks! I had a lot of fun putting this together. Larry’s talk is really good too and I really enjoyed watching that one live. I picked K Lars Lohn overall because of his message. In my opinion Python is as popular as it is because of the community behind it. I felt like this talk encompasses that. 
 &gt;get ready for PHENOMAL COSMIC ITERATION POWERS DjangoGirls' tutorials talk this way unironically
Docker’s official getting started tutorial is awesome! You are going to build a cluster using VMs https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
Are there any toolkits for Python that *don't* use Tkinter that are like what you're thinking? The undo/redo thing has me particularly interested, since that's usually a very domain-specific detail.
Larry's my brother so I posted that. Thank you for mentioning him...I was just having a little fun here and I am a dork. Carry on. 👍 👌
What sort of crashes do you get?
The only one I know is Enthought's envisage and traits/traitsui. Unfortunately it has other problems and a steep learning curve, but the approach is there.
It absolutely is the standard. Can you point to any credible sources saying otherwise?
I appreciate the examples and can't wait to try it. However, how do I install and use it? I tried `pip install pytheory` but it didn't find pytheory anywhere. There is also no setup.py file that I can run to install using `python setup.py install`.
Looks zope-ey. Neat idea.
The problem is that there's not a lot out there providing a modern application framework for desktop UI in python. There's excellent support for widget toolkits, but widget toolkits are just the first piece of the puzzle. Developing an application results in a lot of boilerplate with these toolkits (and most importantly, wild code for those who don't know how to organise an application), and application frameworks are the best tool to get rid of this boilerplate, and provide clear guidelines so that people don't create monsters.
What is the scope of the project?
It’s the standard tuning in North America, yes! But that’s not what the term ‘concert pitch’ means. Concert pitch refers to whether an instrument, or conductor’s score, is transposing (having a different pitch written than is sounding) or not. 
Hey there! I'm a previous composition major (for 4 years) turned computer science major (now for 2 years), and I'd definitely be willing to contribute to this project if you'd like.
I agree it's simple to get up and running... I have concerns over the requirement &gt;adding and removing form widgets dynamically. At the moment this is potentially not possible with [PySimpleGUI](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). I would still suggest taking a look at it to see if it can meet your needs. 
Alright, I now understand what exactly you're talking about. Thank you for taking your time explaining it clearly. \&gt; I disagree with that, because my wip wrapper *can* do this, with a decorator that changes the result of a coroutine function from a coroutine object into an object that represents the coroutine I suggest you to opensource it. Even if we don't end up using it in any way it can still be very useful to us and some rehashed ideas can be implemented in asyncio. As for the backwards compatibility argument: if we enable JS-like semantics for all coroutines in asyncio, it would inevitably introduces races to code that was using \`asyncio.gather()\` etc. It's a common pattern in asyncio to pass \`coro()\` objects around and the current invariant is that they are suspended \*until\* you wrap them in a \`Task\`. \&gt; I don't currently know the performance implications but I doubt them to be significant, and if they are they can be worked on. It depends on whether you're decorating every coroutine or only top level ones. Decorating every coroutine will make things slower; for instance this is how pre-async/await and pre-yield-from frameworks did it, and the performance hit was significant (easily 10x slower). There's a way of doing what you want without decorators, but it would require us to modify how \`await &lt;expr&gt; "(...)"\` works in the interpreter, and chances that we ever do that are slim.
I just set this up on a machine that didn't have python. I had to install PrettyTable, Tesseract and added: pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r"C:\Program Files (x86)\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe" to twohundrediq I tried it against some screen-grabs and it seems to mostly work. First impressions are: answer format could be a/b/c dark blue is really hard to read Could be a bit slow for live game? I'll try it for research purposes! 
The For Humans thing is getting really tired, even if you came up with it.
[PySimpleGUI](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) can integrate with Matplotlib and Pyplot. It wraps tkinter in a way that removes much of the GUI burden from the programmer. There are a couple of demo programs showing how to do this. Without knowing the kinds of controls you need to manipulate your data, it's hard for me to say much more than take a look. Do you have any sample screen shots for what you hope it'll look like? Would be cool for you to come back and post screen shots of what you create. Sounds interesting.
You can tune differently but most people don’t. Depending on the scope of the project this is a perfectly adequate heuristic. As of now the scope looks to be a project revolving around guitar based music theory. I which case A440 is THE standard tuning.
I think you’re mistaken. Transposing instruments have to be wary of concert pitch, but concert pitch exists outside of transposing instruments.
Concert pitch means 'not transposing'. It doesn't refer to tuning at ALL.
So say 'standard tuning'! What's wrong with that? Don't take another term 'concert pitch', and use it for something it doesn't actually mean.
I mean just look up the term concert pitch online. It’s practically synonymous with tuning.
The questions are usually 10 seconds iirc. However Im trying to work with aiohttp or another library to send batch requests to the wikipedia api wrapper. This way I can *hopefully* grab results faster. Also going to work with threads to see if it can speed up requests. If you'd like to contribute in any way (even to the readme) feel free to make a PR! Id love as much help as possible
[removed]
It’s a tag line. How are taglines ‘memes’ 
No, it's not. Concert pitch and tuning are only indirectly related. Sure, concert pitch is dependent on what tuning system you're currently using, but saying 'clarinet in concert pitch' tells me that it's a clarinet reading a non-transposed part, and doesn't tell me ANYTHING about the tuning system being used.
I started this for myself a while back and anytime I have to look something up more than once (and sometimes, in the beginning, even just once) I would put it in the sheet. Not included are some additional convenience tools I built to do some of this more easily. I may open them up in the future if I get the time.
That's not too bad of a solution actually, though if possible I would still suggest trying to add a method to the coroutine object.
And out comes the fascist reddit downvote army! No constructive criticism, just downvotes!!!!
Really big Thx. 
Source?
The shortest answer is that you are choosing between preemptive and cooperative multitasking.
Check out r/learnpython
I believe it refers to both—you either tune to A-440Hz (concert pitch) or you tune to whatever note 440Hz happens to refer to on your transposing instrument.
Memes for Humans
Well the author already posted a definition in the pr. You've disagreed with it, so the burden is on you. That said... https://www.dictionary.com/browse/concert-pitch?s=t https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_pitch https://www.musikalessons.com/blog/2017/02/concert-pitch/ All of those popular links explicitly state that concert pitch refers to the standard tuning of A440. They also state that the term CAN be used to distinguish between written and sounding pitch. That might be where you got confused. You CAN make the distinction, but it isn't necessary.
That's interesting since coroutines actually run in a thread. Threads are only "resource inefficient" relative to coroutines if you use them incorrectly.
Not OP, but he's technically right: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert\_pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_pitch) A4 = 440 is probably the most standard example of concert pitch nonprofessionally. Buuuut, it isn't the only one. In fact... I'd wager most major professional symphonies don't tune to 440. Boston Symphony, San Francisco Symphony, New York Phil, and Berlin Phil all tune to slightly higher frequencies supposedly. This (albeit horrendously styled) site purportedly has documented the tuning pitches of a good number of orchestras, and the vast majority are not 440 [http://members.aon.at/fnistl/index.html](http://members.aon.at/fnistl/index.html) &amp;#x200B;
Probably going to take it fairly easy this week. This weekend I got a twitter bot, ['Bot Ross'](https://twitter.com/HppyLittleTweet) tweeting more reasonably by fixing the detokenizing loose ends it had. I want to work on my [other twitter bot](https://twitter.com/Keith_Event) and start upgrading it again. I'm planning on adding a kalman filter to classify events, and a really risky auto-summarizer among other things (the summarizer will select tweets to make an extractive summary). But this week I've got other things to take care of, so I probably won't be able to do much. Those are just small upgrades so I'm hoping I'll get a couple of hours here and there to at least start them. The reddit bot needs more focus than this week will allow, so I'll get back to it next week. 
You have my vote in this meaningless dispute.
And you have my bow!
I haven't studied music theory officially, so maybe I'm missing something, but isn't the example for chord fingering for custom tuning wrong? &gt;&gt;&gt; from pytheory import Tone, Fretboard, CHARTS &gt;&gt;&gt; tones = ( ... Tone.from_string("F2"), ... Tone.from_string("C3"), ... Tone.from_string("G3"), ... Tone.from_string("D4"), ... Tone.from_string("A5"), ... Tone.from_string("E5") ... ) &gt;&gt;&gt; fretboard = Fretboard(tones=tones) &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; c_chord = CHARTS['western']["C"] &gt;&gt;&gt; print(c_chord.fingering(fretboard=fretboard)) (0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3) Western C chord is a major triad: C E G Strings are F2 / C3 / G3 / D4 / A5 / E5 (from low to high). You then give a chord fingering of 000333 which seems to be F2 - C3 - G3 - F4 - C4 - G5. Why are there F instead of G? This would be a Csus4.
Yes sir. I understand hat Kenneth puts that on all of his libraries. That doesn’t make it a meme. 
I've sadly yet to find anything in python as powerful as Jackson (particularly regarding polymorphism) - py's decision to reframe annotations as explicitly only for type annotations (instead of general-purpose as they were originally) kind of threw a monkey wrench into using them to specify equivalent information (and its decorators are a poor substitute for that duty). I've been slowly working on a library with this capability but it's nowhere near releasable :/ cattrs looks like a nice start if you already use attrs though, hadn't seen that yet.
There are a few definitions of meme. Let's use this one: &gt; a humorous image, video, piece of text, etc., that is copied (often with slight variations) and spread rapidly by Internet users. He's taking a "humorous" bit of text, applying it to his libraries, and attempting to use it to spread those libraries. It's a meme.
He’s a single user. He puts it on all his stuff, like Nike says ‘just do it’ on all their stuff doesn’t make it a meme. 
Thx mate!
The essence of the debate is whether pitch refers to frequency and whether concert pitch can refer to A440. /u/GryptpypeThynne is under the impression that concert pitch has NOTHING to do with tuning. They are mistaken. In their outrage they glossed over a subtly in the definition. Concert pitch usually implies a tuning frequency. The international standard is A440. HOWEVER, you can also use the term concert pitch to distinguish between written and sounding notes. But you don't have to make the distinction. That's where /u/GryptpypeThynne got confused.
You have a chord with no name as sus4 instead of the major triad it should be. E.g., in your example the chord has C F G (Csus4) instead of C E G (C chord). &gt;&gt;&gt; from pytheory import Tone, Fretboard, CHARTS &gt;&gt;&gt; tones = ( ... Tone.from_string("F2"), ... Tone.from_string("C3"), ... Tone.from_string("G3"), ... Tone.from_string("D4"), ... Tone.from_string("A5"), ... Tone.from_string("E5") ... ) &gt;&gt;&gt; fretboard = Fretboard(tones=tones) &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; c_chord = CHARTS['western']["C"] &gt;&gt;&gt; print(c_chord.fingering(fretboard=fretboard)) (0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3) Notes are F2 - C3 - G3 - F4 - C4 - G5

Irrelevant. He has infected this phrase to be a personal marketing strategy and it is laughable as it has extended into other areas of Python and tech. It's to the point where it makes people literally scoff off at the tagline.
A personal marketing strategy doesn’t make it a meme. 
When it's so overused that it's a bad joke, it is. You're using a very strict and singular definition of meme while others see it as more than one thing.
Meh whatever. I’m just gold get off my lawn. 
Concert pitch is pretty distinctly used to refer whichever pitch/frequency an ensemble is tuned to. A440 just happens to be the most common such pitch so it ends up being a commonly used term for it via synechdoche. It also means "non-transposed part" as you suggested. But terms can have more than one meaning... so I'd recommend for your own sake that you not get so up in arms about it. After all, [who gives a f\*\*\* about an oxford comma?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_i1xk07o4g)
Yeah re-reading his other responses, he's got some weird zealotry about how the term should be used, when it's clearly got several common use-cases. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ oh, well
lmaooooooooooooooooooooooo
um, the reference pitch is a parameter, defaulting to 440
It's a mee-mee
please send a pr! i'm not too familiar with chords
I'm not taking away from your project in the least, I'm sure it's a great library as usual. That said, last time you were being attacked on here I defended you because I thought you were being treated unfairly. It's pretty obvious in retrospect you don't deal with criticism well and at least in part brought some of the criticism on yourself.
Fair enough. I'm sure you're aware it's not a new criticism though.
That's a very intuitive default parameter. Great choice. Its nice that you allow folks to change the parameter, too. It seems like there's a big demand for it. Also I think it is reasonable to use frequency and note names interchangeably in nearly all cases.
The difference is that coroutines all run in a single thread with cooperative multitasking based on the generator mechanism, where the user manually yields control to other coroutines. This is a lot more resource efficient compared to threads which is preemptively switched by the OS. Threads need do a trap, switch to kernel mode, switch the thread, reenter user space again and continue execution. And there is the GIL, so you don't even get any benefits from parallelization. Coroutines are a significantly faster and lighter, simply because multitasking is handled by the interpreter, with no OS involvement. Since the programmer gets full control over when a coroutine yields control to other coroutines, it makes synchronizing coroutines a lot easier to reason about. With threads you have no control. A thread can be preempted by the OS at any time, which means you have to work harder to make sure stuff happens in the correct order.
\&gt; implying Kenneth can take criticism
I reference the [matplotlib PDF](https://matplotlib.org/Matplotlib.pdf) frequently. The documentation starts on section 6 (page 717) and is really thorough and contains links to other parts of the document that have things in more detail or all possible options. Definitely worth checking out.
This is awesome! I'll see of I can contribute some commits to it. I love finding new Open Source projects here.
Small potatoes...but I created a excel/power pivot automation routine where dashboards are sent out to a distribution list. I use windows task scheduler to run the routine once per month. Python uses macro templates to control what excel should do. It can refresh the data model, create PDFs, raw data files, etc. It uses a csv file of email addresses to distribute the PDFs and/or raw data files. Python distributes the data based on a slicer in the power pivot. It iterates through the slicer to create a specific sets of data or dashboard views, saves the files, finds the associated email addresses in the csv file and slings the email out. It keeps going through the slicer till done. It also archives all the files that were sent. It also has logging and informs me when it breaks.
I helped a friend out by creating an Instagram scraper that will download all photos in a certain tag as well as store info about each photo in a small database running with the program, then run a facial recognition tool over it and see which are useful for a bachelor thesis research project with ridiculous requirements (but where publishing isn't needed nor are the moral or ethical requirements for the sources of the dataset). For obvious reasons is the code not available. Uses selenium to kick start the thing, then forwards the session to requests which does the rest
Why? Pipenv does nothing useful.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_pitch &gt; Concert pitch is the pitch reference to which a group of musical instruments are tuned for a performance. Concert pitch may vary from ensemble to ensemble, and has varied widely over musical history. In the literature this is also called international standard pitch. The most common modern tuning standard uses 440 Hz for A above middle C as a reference note, with other notes being set relative to it. &gt; The term "concert pitch" is also used to distinguish between the "written" (or "nominal"), and "sounding" (or "real") notes of a transposing instrument – concert pitch here refers to the sounding pitch on a non-transposing instrument. Music for transposing instruments is transposed into different keys from that of non-transposing instruments—for example, playing a written C on a B♭ clarinet or trumpet produces a non-transposing instrument's B♭. This pitch is referred to as "concert B♭" Doesn't that mean you're both right and are just arguing about an overloaded term?
username checks out :P no problem. I love his talks and can't wait to see more in the next PyCons.
Pretty much, except one usage is common among musicians worldwide and the other is not. 
Fine, but that would make this statement &gt; Concert pitch means 'not transposing'. It doesn't refer to tuning at ALL. incorrect, no?
Literally, yes; in the context of talking/explaining to musicians? No
&gt; Literally, yes I'll take it! :)
&gt; This is a lot more resource efficient compared to threads which is preemptively switched by the OS. Threads need do a trap, switch to kernel mode, switch the thread, reenter user space again and continue execution. this is the context switch, and in most cases, it the roughly the same or often faster than what the Python interpreter can do when it context switches coroutines. See my example at https://stackoverflow.com/a/51932442/34549 illustrating this with gevent, for example. Or my asyncio example at http://techspot.zzzeek.org/2015/02/15/asynchronous-python-and-databases/. Feel free to illustrate a simple demonstration program that can get through a given set of work using asyncio meaningfully faster than what could be achieved with threads, I'm still waiting to see one (and I keep writing ones that show threads doing it a bit faster). &gt; Coroutines are a significantly faster I disagree. Coroutines provide for more IO throughput. They do not invent speed within the interpreter. &gt; lighter A coroutine is "lighter" than a thread because it does not represent what a thread represents. It's not really comparable. It is more comparable to a task that I might put on a queue to be handled by a thread, since that's what it really is. &gt; simply because multitasking is handled by the interpreter, with no OS involvement. the intepreter's context switch is usually more expensive than the OS-native switch. However with non-blocking IO, you have a lot fewer of them, which helps as long as you aren't CPU bound. &gt; Since the programmer gets full control over when a coroutine yields control to other coroutines, it makes synchronizing coroutines a lot easier to reason about. This is subjective and I disagree completely. &gt; With threads you have no control. you have complete control over concurrent activities within a process using locking primitives just like you can do with coroutines. This is mostly a canard because sharing state across threads is usually not necessary except for things like caches and databases, where you need to worry about concurrency and locking across processes even if you are using an async approach. non-blocking IO doesn't solve for modern day concurrency problems since non-trivial applications are multi-process. &gt; A thread can be preempted by the OS at any time, which means you have to work harder to make sure stuff happens in the correct order. You do your work that's in "the correct order" in a single thread. Modern applications are multi-process and communicate with other services and databases, which are inherently "pre-emptive" in terms of what happens when. non-blocking IO with events does not usually save you from this issue.

It was 0/6 on the run I just tried. Questions were successfully captured, but not the answers. Answer was always NONE ( I assume the options should show as captured text?) It might be a contrast thing? Don't have time right now to dissect it. I'll have another look tomorrow.
dictionary.com, emphasis mine: &gt; _usually_ established at 440 vibrations per second The wikipedia article actually contradicts itself... and you: &gt; Despite such confusion, A = 440 Hz is the only official standard and is widely used around the world. Many orchestras in the United Kingdom adhere to this standard as concert pitch.[16] In the United States some orchestras use A = 440 Hz, while others, such as the New York Philharmonic, use A = 442 Hz.[17] The latter is also often used as a tuning frequency in Europe,[3] especially in Denmark, France, Hungary, Italy, Norway and Switzerland.[18] Nearly all modern symphony orchestras in Germany and Austria and many in other countries in continental Europe (such as Russia, Sweden and Spain) tune to A = 443 Hz.[16][18] The Boston Symphony Orchestra tunes to A = 441 Hz. The source (16) for the claim that "A = 440 Hz is the only official standard" is some Austrian dude's web site that says absolutely nothing of the sort. musikalessons.com claims 440 Hz is "the universal standard pitch", with no source. As for an _actual_ authoritative source, A = 440 Hz is standardized by ISO 16 (https://www.iso.org/standard/3601.html). However, we've established pretty clearly that what's considered _standard_ doesn't necessarily inform or influence established practice. All this still says nothing about how, being freely chosen by the musician, the tuning of a transposing instrument is only indirectly related to whatever an ensemble uses for their "concert pitch".

The essence of the debate is whether pitch refers to frequency and whether concert pitch can refer to A440. Regarding variants. Yes other tunings besides A440 get used. I've never indicated otherwise. And the author of the library himself said he's just using it as the default value for the reference pitch parameter. You can even change it. But if you're going to set a default value, would you really set it to anything other than 440? It is the universal standard. The obvious choice. And I felt the outrage with which /u/GryptpypeThynne reacted to that default value was unwarranted.
How is pyside2 treating you? I loved pyside but the lack of qt5 support drove me back to pyqt5. Haven't had a chance to poke around with pyside2 since it was announced. Stable? Feature complete?
Looks like there is a github page if you would like to make a pull request.
Not the answer you're looking for, but I use pyqtgraph and pyqt when I want to do anything interactive, because matplotlib drives me up the wall and I don't speak tkinter (I already knew Qt from C++ days). If you have any pyqt experience, I'd recommend loading up pyqtgraphs example programs and seeing if it interests you. If you have no pyqt experience, the learning curve will be steep.
Actually thinking about it the first question gave me a suggested answer, just the wrong one! "Someone not speaking clearly is said to be what?

Perhaps you getting downvoted is an indication of the general sentiment towards your stance? Just like you can say the ISO standard is 440Hz all you want but it doesn’t make it relevant to all of Europe. You can be technically correct here all you want and it doesn’t make it applicable usage of the terminology. 
Good thing to teach music theory then lol
The question they're asking is why you do that instead of: if __name__ == '__main__': main()
You should call out that this is essentially a wrapper library around Pytuning.
Building some new infrastructure to launch a set of public APIs and a posting/commenting system. Really focusing on performance. 
I know right! A lot of focus goes into GUI's and not a lot of love into the Command Line, so when I saw that talk I was super excited. His tools are awesome too. If you ever work with PostGres or MySQL you should use his tools.
As a musician, A == 440hz in most modern environments. The reason people give for using other standards are based either in pseudoscience, sacred geometry, and Nazi conspiracy theory (no joke). The fact that the library lets you specify pythagorean temperament is pretty neat.

Interesting thought experiment: how would you go about writing an interface to non-western music theory. Starting with pentatonic scales (african / eurasian), then scales which are different ascending and descending (indian) , then scales with semitones (turkish, persian, others). Some musical traditions include 4 or more "cents" between what we'd approximate as a single chromatic step. Interesting challenge fitting this into one system. 
+1000 to this. Since switching to Plotly, the interactivity alone (drag to zoom!!) has saved my company hours that would otherwise have been spent adjusting axes to get a better look at the data. It's great for analysis in Jupyter notebooks but it'll also save your charts as self-contained HTML files so you can share them and still have the interactivity. We use offline mode and `show_link=False`to remove the annoying branding, and cufflinks for quick plots off of pandas DataFrames (df.iplot()replaces df.plot()). One downside for us has been that there's a little more boilerplate to create a simple chart - you have to nest three objects before you even get to put your data in: plotly.iplot(go.Data([go.Scatter(x=[1, 2, 3], y=[4,5,6])])) That feel significantly heavier weight than plt.plot(x=[1, 2, 3], y=[4,5,6]) ...but it's not too bad and it's nice to not be mutating a global plot object all the time. Second downside/pro-tip: There's a flurry of pretty good examples on their site, but the full API reference is a little hard to find and use. When I need to know what values I can actually use for something, I go here: https://plot.ly/python/reference/ . Note that you'll have to wait for the entire page to load before the search box works properly.

Expected to see this thread full of Kenneth Reitz hate due to the previous reddit fiasco. Just as expected... 
official documentation...actual sounds sarcastic
If you want to use numpy (or some scipy) funcs in cuda, use cupy. If you want to do machine learning with cuda, try chainer, cupy was split out of it into a separate package. &amp;#x200B; You could use Tensorflow or pytorch, too.
I'm flattered that my talk is included in the list. Thank you for taking the time to compile it. 
I'm quite a newcomer to this subreddit, could you briefly explain what's the deal with the guy?
This is great, thank you! I don't use matplotlib much at work, but my gf is doing her PhD in bio and I help her out all the time with matplotlib graphs, and I feel like I relearn how to do a line graph every time. She needs the images, and doesn't work with a jupyter notebook or anything. Maybe you could add a reference to savefig or something? Also, might help some people to be able to see a quick way to load a CSV or tab delimited file, even if it's just loading a CSV with x and y values and turning it into a line or scatter plot.
I have no hate for Kenneth, he has contributed tremendously to the Python community. I just don't think a tagline which implicitly degrades other peoples work is a good way to promote your work.
Thanks! I'm going to take a look and see what's new. :)
I want it to be self-contained so I do not want to have to have another file for loading. But, I think the best way for a CSV is to use Pandas import pandas as pd data = pd.DataFrame.from_csv('...') Or, if you don't care about knowing the labels: np.loadtxt('...',skiprows=1,delimiter=',') As for saving, I could include it, but it is just `plt.savefig` or `fig.savefig`. The only change I make to my own saving is that, when I am saving as PDF, I will run it through `pdfcrop` that comes with my LaTeX install.
What about all major European orchestras? 
He who has a glass house should know better than to throw stones. But Kenneth decided to throw stones anyway. And thus he was thrown off his pedestal. Yes some of the comments there went too far, but many did not. And it doesn't excuse Kenneth in the slightest. And I will continue to bring this up at any mention of him until he does a fucking ego check and apologizes to this community for what he did.

As a musician in Australia with a background in both orchestral and choral music, I'm familiar with both terms and have encountered both terms used many times. The context makes it clear which meaning is intended.
The Python core devs disagree, which is why it's a recommended tool: [https://packaging.python.org/guides/tool-recommendations/](https://packaging.python.org/guides/tool-recommendations/)
Trying to figure out if catboost is worth the trouble of tuning and training 
"Consider other tools such as [pip](https://packaging.python.org/key_projects/#pip) when pipenv does not meet your use case." Which I would say is most of the time, since it doesn't do anything. Just use poetry and forget about this piece of trash :P
Could also be based on screen size. You can save the image as well. Going to be working on it. If you look at processimage() you'll see a crop method. You can change that to make it better suited to your screen size. You can use img.show() to show it as well. Might not be that exact function. Ill be working on this. 
Y'all are overthinking this. It's jarring for me to encounter the word "slave" out of its very loaded context. I'm sure older, more seasoned programmers are not "taken out" of their current context when they encounter the word, but that's not the case for everyone in this field. Using terminology with strong connotations that have nothing to do with the topic at hand isn't the best idea in any situation or industry. The tech company I work for stopped using "master" and "slave" terminology across all off our infrastructure some years ago. I'm glad they did too. It's such a silly thing to just leave around when so many companies claim they care about "diversity &amp; inclusion". You as an individual may have a neutral response to the words, but that doesn't mean every new employee that you hope feels comfortable learning and growing at your company will feel the same. If there was a legitimate strong argument for keeping the terms, that would be one thing. But I haven't seen that argument yet. This should really just be a non issue, yet it's become a big thing for no real reason.
Yeah I'm going to be tweaking it a bit over the next few days. Still a WIP running tests tonight at the 9pm game. Going to try and get it working better. 
I appreciate the feedback btw :)
Did you get this done?
Any tutorial you find online like something from Sentdex who is a great YouTuber that covers videos on different Python frameworks/libraries. 
Pentest, baby. Life is good. Getting a custom python shell working tonight, installing it on a bunch of systems in the morning. Gotta love orgs that use the same local admin password on all their servers, then allow local admin to log in remotely.
What do you mean? 
They're relics /s Although you're not going to convince me that tuning to a442 is done for any sensible reason, I would agree that it should be a user-controllable variable. I think I'll contribute a patch :)
PyPa != Core devs. Also, contributors of pipenv are members of PyPa. Also ... Pipenv doesn't even do packaging. 
r/learnpython
Fantastic.
This is pretty fantastic!
Finalizing a reddit bot. 
it looks like sawtooth_wave() from play.py has 440 hardcoded. Don't have time to trace but that should probably be parameterized too. 
Sure its not done for any sensible reason, definitely! But the fact that so many do still renders the ISO standard relatively moot.

It does come. It helps a lot to have a project, a small, specific task you would like to get done with the code. And /r/learnpython is a good place to look for those kinds of tasks :-)
That's where I disagree. Whereas a variation of 2hz is outside the abilities of most humans to reproduce*, computers can do it reliably. And computers really care about standards. * Temperature and string tension are just too variable, and our instruments aren't perfect across the entire range, and we're playing relative to other slightly imperfect humans
Damn, this is *thorough*. Doing the lords work right here. 
Cheat... sheet? It's 52 pages (printed) lol Still great though, thanks!
I think you knew too much about it. The way I've seen defense contractors work is that no single person is intimate with a whole process. Many know much about little pieces which all get stitched together later
I created a new way to store time series data. It compresses about 200x. Unfortunately I did it at work, they're going to patent it.
How's the feature parity against SonicPi? It uses Ruby and I'm not too familiar with that language.
You're too fragile for open source man. 
Forgive him...he's a drummer.
This might seem like a dumb question but how on earth do you get the text to be so clean? When I produce a visualization I have a real hard time making it not pixelated :/
You just saved my life with this. 11/10, would upvote again 
Honestly, the people antagonizing Keith and the people who want to bring back “slave” are convincing me that a lot of assholes read /r/Python. 
Just FYI you can use the API with your credentials to receive the questions without the need to use OpenCV, AND simultaneously have the app open and submit your answers. I made a python script for this and won $1.67.
Holy smokes, the breadth of this. Excellent work - thanks for sharing!

I'd like to challenge your viewpoint on this issue: - First of all - the analogy of Master/Slave whilst widespread is wrong. When the master dies, the slave takes the master's place. - The effort to do this is pretty minimal and hurts no one, whilst it acknowledges slavery was/is a part of humanity that we should be ashamed of. - Surveying the people behind this if they are think comunism / capitalism is a good or bad thing is a really simplistic way to break down our whole society. The world is more complex than this and you can decouple cultural sensitivity without losing a sense of pragmatism
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
Love this. Love matplotlib. Every time someone tells me that they prefer R because it is better for visualization, I want to slap them.
Are there any examples of this?
Macbook Pro with no doubt! Perhaps Apple's products always high price compare with Wintel but Mac's performance and lifetime always worth your consideration.
Actually I also write wrappers for my personal use where I mark the entry point with @mainz decorator then it will wrap every coroutine functions in the global namespace after that it can be used as if it's a normal function and can be await as well. For me, this makes asynchronous in Python feel more like async in C#/Dart, which I personally think it's more intuitive. &amp;#x200B; If you mind check the code: [https://github.com/BLeAm/asyncz](https://github.com/BLeAm/asyncz)
Personal preference. I use Windows.
It depends entirely on the code. If you're doing heavy number crunching (without tools like NumPy, which are written in low-level languages for this reason) I would surprised if it was _only_ 50x. But if you're moving strings around from one socket to another and sometimes parsing them, probably would see a perf decrease in a lot of cases thanks to stuff like the Python dict implementation being so optimized.
I would say stick with what you have ordered. You can always run VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org) on your PC if you would like to try out different operating systems. It's a great way to feel your way around OSes. 
I need to clean it up toss it on github, but I rewrote someone’s PHP app https://github.com/jkalter11/hq-trivia-assistant/ You will need to use mitmproxy or something similar to retrieve your client id which this dude talks about on his github
I think i can set up a burpsuite proxy and connect through my phone to sniff traffic

Have you used ggplot much? It is very expressive and for a lot of use cases is much quicker to use than matplotlib.
Very easy to believe. But just rewriting some python code in C and getting something 1000 times faster *doesn't* mean python is 1000 times slower than C, it means that the C algorithm is 1000 times faster then the python algorithm. It's quite possible the python algorithm was inefficient and was 300 times slower than another algorithm in python. As an extreme case of this consider the naive Fibonacci algorithm: def fibonacci(n): if n == 0: return 0 if n == 1: return 1 return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) If you call this `fibonacci(40)` it takes quite a while to complete. I guess python is slow, right? Yet if you [memoize](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) the code: fib_memo = {0: 0, 1: 1} # memo + base cases def fibonacci_memo(n): if n not in fib_memo: fib_memo[n] = (fibonacci_memo(n-1) + fibonacci_memo(n-2)) return fib_memo[n] you get a speedup of 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 depending on platform. TLDR: get your python algorithms right before rewriting in C.
What specifically do you want to do with it, anyway? I love VS Code for Python development, and you have that on Windows, Mac (and Linux). I've been developing software for a living for 20+ years; mostly performance critical stuff. I did not come across too many people who thought that Xcode was better than VisualStudio for our domain. So, I would take any broad claims of "macbook \[...\] superior in the coding world" with a grain of salt. &amp;#x200B;
keep the PC but install Linux. Absolutely the best
Well to be fair, that's not a bad thing in the least. Don't get me wrong, I dislike this extremely rude egomaniac as much as the next guy. But he does write good packages. I hands down admit that I admire his skill, and he is in no doubt an excellent engineer. Requests was great. Pipenv is good, bar some very important criticisms. Requests-HTML, git-legit, delegator.py (though personally I'd never use it), and more, all good if not great. Some libraries, such as this one, have very, very niche uses, but to say good software is bad merely because you or I don't have a need for it is a fallacy. The fact that it's all wrappers both can be and can't be considered relevant-- I mean, yes, he could have improved the upstream, but many of the changes aren't backwards compatibile because they are fundamental design decisions. The design of the previous systems are sub-par, while his, again, I concede, are nearly impeccable, imho. However, the way that he acts within his communities, to people on this subreddit, to this subreddit as a whole, is disgusting. The for humans tagline is annoying. And he has a very high view of himself that needs to be brought down a few pegs. Which again, is why I still await for him to submit an apology in full to this subreddit, either as a self post, or as a letter on his blog. But he does write good software.
I didn't even realize Flickr was still running. I figured it drowned when the SS Yahoo stated to sink.
Thanks! I actually ended up doing all that but instead of step 5, I ran `python test_pytheory.py` but it failed on importing pytheory (itself). 
Nobody codes with XCode on a Mac except iOS developers, though. That's not why people buy Macs. I honestly don't think I've ever even opened XCode in the 5yrs since I switched from Linux.
Cython can compile Python down into C-- in pure Python mode it can give up to a 40% or so speed boost. Adding Cython typing, then even faster. For complicated algorithms, in theory, yes, C can be much faster. However I do believe that "1000 times" is an exaggeration-- but perhaps I've just never seen such a thing in terms of a reasonable program.
There's a huge "pc vs mac" war, and people are on both sides. I don't think it matters. Almost every tool is cross platform nowadays. Given the choice, I'd go for Windows every time because it gives me more options for hardware. I really think you're making a mistake by dismissing linux outright; but that's your choice and I'll respect it.
its not that i dont want linux its that i dont want to lose some of the features like the fingerprint sensor and touchscreen. If there are any distros that can keep these things features working ill be all over it. heres the video im basing my Linux concern on(he doesn't talk about the fingerprint sensor i got that info from some comments): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZFCDe1AJo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZFCDe1AJo)
I'm mostly familiar with C++, C# and Python. What do people use on a Mac then? Or if it's not the IDE or toolset, what makes the Mac so appealing?
Either something by JetBrains, VSC, Sublime, or Vim. Visual Studio can also be installed to work with .Net Core and people at work do this, but I personally don't have experience with it.
This is very similar to a piece of what I'm doing in terms of functionality. However in terms of implementation, dear lord touching the stack is a dangerous nono
You should probably try to get most of this checked into the matplotlib documentation.

as far as coding itself, it doesn't really matter for python. any laptop with any OS will be fine. with that budget, you have a lot of options. Specs are one thing, but with laptops, other traits are equally important: temperature, noise, weight, battery life. that laptop looks decent, but you might consider going here: https://www.notebookcheck.net/ that site does pretty in-depth reviews of lots of laptops. at the top, be sure to filter reviews and laptops. anything with a percentage to the left of the article title is a review done by them also, check out the top-10 lists. they keep them pretty up-to-date 
And if you rewrote it in hand-rolled assembly it'd be even faster than C, which is why nobody writes anything in C.
the rule of thumb is if you are running `for ` loops for non-trivial calculation, you are probably doing it wrong.
It's the only way to monkey patch all coroutine functions automatically. Anyway, I'am aware the risk of messing around the stack, so, that's why I said that I'll only use this approach in my personal project that I know exactly what exposed to the global/stack and if I want to avoid that I'll just mark coroutine functions with @az decorator manually and make sure to put "await waitAll()" at the end of the entry point that will work fine.
A high quality Windows laptop would have great performance and lifetime, and it would still be cheaper. 
That `female?` column, tho xD I'm guessing a gender comparison on the dataset or something. Hope someone jumped on this one.
Pygame are looking for people to do this very thing. If you feel like diving into pygame, you could do that. 
The thing that Mac/Linux OS beats windows at is this: Stability &amp; Continuous Performance The thing the Mac outperforms everything in: Trackpad You will never need an external mouse for a mac. (also don't forget the trackpad gestures to switch windows apps etc). Unless gaming is a requirement I would always recommend a Mac Laptop. Purely for the reasons I listed. Windows 10 is very annoying: Adds / Notifications for Microsoft services (Hey we have an authenticator, hey we have one drive, hey we have this...) \*\*\* Highly annoying Stability &amp; Performance trumps everything for me. As far as applications for development pretty much all of the apps youd want to use are available on mac Jet brains IDEs ([https://www.jetbrains.com/](https://www.jetbrains.com/)) Sublime Text Every linux port (mac ports) If you need the MS Office suite its available on the mac too (and plenty of Open Source alternatives as well). If I knew you in person, Id be like.. just get the mac. I'd bet good money you'd never regret it.
It's an Aladdin reference
Well, write matrix multiplication in python and C and you will see the 100x perf diff. Having said this 100x is close to the worst case I have ever observed. Typically the difference is quite a bit smaller. I have never seen 1000x on similar code. BUT... As is the case with all numbers, there are massive gotchas to be aware of. E.g. pypy will likely bring perf difference to &lt;5x with zero code changes. Similarly, numpy based code will be likely comparable to C code. Etc... 
Yes, have used ggplot quite a bit. While I agree that ggplot provides nicer results “out of the box”, speed is generally not my primary concern—I’m happy to write more than one line of code to achieve a publication quality vis. IMO, when it comes to building detailed visualizations, mpl is at least as capable as ggplot, and much nicer to work with.
Thanks so much for this! You’ve cleared up a couple of things for me from one quick flick-through.
Not sure what you mean, but have you tried increasing the dpi when you save to an image? plt.savefig("filename.png", dpi=300)
Fair enough, if you work with mpl enough, you can get it to do everything ggplot does.
While it's not common, numpy arrays can actually hold any object using the `numpy.object` dtype. They do not have to be of the same type.
Thank you for sharing! I’ve started doing something similar but not even close to this workbook. Well done 
Function calls are costly. The naive implementation has n!+(n-1)! function calls each time it executes. The second example uses caching to improve speed for subsequent calls. If N is the largest argument used at a given point in time, a subsequent call with n&lt;N does not need function calls, it just needs to look up the answer in the dict. And if it is called with n&gt;N, it does not need to calculate all the way down to zero, but just to N, which it then gets from the dict.
I ran some burp intercepting and got the API and auth keys! Their API is so easy to use lol. Thank you so much for letting me know!
Actual as in opposed to a Twitter link.
The issue with the first example is that on each call to `fibonacci(n)`, the function will compute the previous two fibonacci numbers independently and from scratch. Each of these two computations will again compute two fibonacci numbers from scratch, and so on. You can see how this quickly explodes (we say it has exponential complexity). The second example, on the other hand, remembers any fibonacci numbers it has already computed in a dict, so it won't have to compute them from scratch again.
Plus there's Seaborn.
Do not use Python for CPU intensive tasks. Python shines in the web since things are IO intensive (connecting to databases, retrieving files, etc). Python also shines as a "glue" or an "orchestrator" in projects like Sage Math or OpenStack. Python also is great as a very high level language that hides C code, like those statistic and machine learning APIs (pandas, scipy, numpy). &amp;#x200B; But writing something like tensorflow/numpy/etc entirely in Python makes no sense. Writing the CPU intensive code in C/Cython and encapsulating it via a Python API makes complete sense, that's why Python is getting so popular those days. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
It's a pity because it definitely is. The reason why people don't use it is exactly because there are no good application frameworks for it. Only a few widget toolkits. On this I also have quite something to say. PyQt is acceptable. Marred by licensing issues initially but it got better, unless you go commercial. It has its problems, but mostly because of the nature of Qt itself. Overall it's a good, solid product. PySide is... I don't know. They always come up and then disappear and then come back again. It seems it got better recently, but I don't know. wxWindows. It's ok, but its widgets are not as good and well made as Qt. It's a bit dodgy in some choices of design, and it's not as extensive as Qt, but it's also a solid product with a good history. tk: its style is obsolete, both visually and design. I think it was included in python because tk was all they had at the time and wanted something to make GUIs, but in my opinion it should not be in the standard library. It's a living fossil of python and I would not consider it for anything else but a simple dialog (and even then). 
That's not what I said - despite your quotes. I said it's (a) more complex than I binary decision (b) not at all relevant to a discussion related to sensitive language.
I see no problems with the documentation, it is an introduction to the PyAbel package that assumes you are familiar with the Abel transform beforehand. I'd say that this is a reasonable assumption since you can easily fill books with information on that specific transform. If you want to learn about the transform I'd recommend reading books instead of the documentation of a package that "simply" implements it.
You're wrong on both counts. It's completely not a binary decision on whether you tolerate communism or not. And it's also entirely relevant to this discussion because there is an *evident* correlation between people who support censoring language in software and people who support communism. It might be a coincidence the first time, but *every* time? And it's also **very** easy to debunk my accusation, btw. Just say "fuck communism, it's a shit system for shit people that has never worked, can never work, and will only ever result in mass death". It's funny how all these people *always* just coincidentally seem to support both censorship and communism, isn't it?
Shouldn't be that hard. First you can ask the user how much marks he want to put in. After that you do a for loop till the input and make sum of the inputs u put in there. After that u divide this sum with you amount of marks. That's your An at least you ask if this is over 5 or not. If yes I print out 5 if not the
This is neat, I guess.

Sorry don't want to send. In your for loop you ask for two inputs, mark and weight and multiply them. The weight you also gut to sum up and sum it at the end up with the amount of marks. 
the library is actually built to support this! western is built-in so far, but I want to build in all known systems.

So useful, thanks for sharing!
since you're practicing, here's some feedback. (on a mostly irrelevat note, a couple things you're doing makes me suspect javascript was your first language?) for the most part, the code looks good. It's a good demonstration of the `adapter` pattern. It's clearly written and easy to understand. so i'll address the OOP specific things 1\. unfortunately you're not really doing OOP here other than literally using a class. wrapping everything in a class here is essentially just unnecessary cruft because 1, you have no instance properties and 2, your class methods never access the instance (i.e., accessing `self`) making them no different than static methods, so all of the functions could be re-written as standalone functions and given how python's module system works, they would be nicely bundled together 2\. in lines 6-14 you're creating essentially static properties. These properties exist on the class definition, not the instance. so if you change them once, they will propagate to all other instances. To demonstrate: &gt;&gt;&gt; class A: ... a = 1 ... ... &gt;&gt;&gt; class B(A): pass ... &gt;&gt;&gt; class C(A): pass ... &gt;&gt;&gt; b = B() &gt;&gt;&gt; c = C() &gt;&gt;&gt; b.a 1 &gt;&gt;&gt; c.a 1 &gt;&gt;&gt; A.a = 3 &gt;&gt;&gt; b.a 3 &gt;&gt;&gt; c.a 3 is that really what you intended? If not, i'd consider passing `soup` object into the constructor. This demonstrates 3 important aspects of OOP: *single responsibility*, *dependency injection*, and *separation of concerns*. 3\. those three principles can make your code more modular and flexible, but it might be overkill for initial use cases, so at the very least i'd set `soup` and only `soup` as `_soup` in the constructor `__init__()`. by doing so, you you free up memory because currently, `chrome_options`, `browser`, `html`, and `url` exist for the entire lifetime of the script whereas they only need to exist to instantiate `soup`. when defined in `__init__` they will be destroyed after construction it will also clean up your api by reducing noise from unnecessary and unused fields 4\. traditionally methods are given verb names, but you can mark methods that return computed values with `@property` and they can be accessed like normal instance properties. I'll demonstrate below 5\. I'd split `current_world_population` into 3 property methods: @property def current_total_population(self) -&gt; int: return int(self.soup.find(id='cp1').getText().replace(',', '')) @property def current_male_population(self) -&gt; int: return int(self.soup.find(id='cp2').getText().replace(',', '')) @property def current_female_population(self) -&gt; int: return int(self.soup.find(id='cp3').getText().replace(',', '')) by doing so, the code becomes completely self-documenting, thus reducing total LOC. (some camps prefer to name related properties in descending order so they are grouped nicely for code completion: `population_total`, `population_female`, `population_male`.) also, I removed `world` because it was redundant. the class is for world measurements, so it is unnecessary to repeat it here. you could consider doing the same for `current` 6\. I would repeat the same process for the other methods that take a parameter and have `if` statements 7\. I would extract `int(Worldometers.soup.find(id='cp9').getText().replace(',', ''))` into its own protected method and parameterize the id I don't have time to go in depth on some of these, but don't take all of my words as aharsh criticism. it's not bad code by any means. but since you said you were practicing i thought you might want some pointers.

Doing it without the API key may well be a violation of their terms of service. Why did you choose to go this route instead of wrapping the API they already provide?
Usually, I posted in both subs. Sadly I hardly get any reply in /r/learnpython. So far this sub has been more helpful lol
Not sure what you are referring to, but perhaps you mean that there is no "strict type checking" or "argument and return type enforcement"? There is a type system and you can get TypeErrors. Try to concatenate a string and an integer. You can indeed add informative annotations and hints, but these are not enforced.

This is amazing work. Thank you so much for sharing. 
Yeah you are right, but flatpak-pip-generator does not work with jupyter, But by writing all the dependency manualy (700 lines !!) it seems to work now I have now an another problem with my c++ code generating wrong filenames like ''$'\\320''!'$'\\237''\~'$'\\377\\177''.' While it was working outside of flatpak But this does not concern python anymore. 
Cool im going to check it out! thank you so much

Hmm fair enough. I have a Dell and they actually sell some of their XPS line with Ubuntu installed, so compatibility is pretty much guaranteed. Ubuntu is probably your best bet, but it might not work out of the box like Windows or Mac does.
Interesting, so it's in the family with coolwarm, and coldhot if I'm remembering their names.
I've had a few people tell me that. In my case, I did in fact try to do both at the same time, but it was just coincidence, I didn't try to do one because of the other. Was learning guitar. Was also working at a university, and would occasionally take a random class for the hell of it. Randomly took Music Theory because it sounded interesting and in my mind a "100 level class in any subject is easy for anyone willing to do the work." Boy was that an... adventure.
He can name it what he likes sure, it's his prerogative, as it is ours to criticize his marketing. His actual projects are fabulous, but he actively degrades the work that made his libraries possible. Just take this project as an example, this library is essentially a wrapper around pytuning, which does all the heavy lifting and involved orders of magnitude more effort to develop. This is not a problem at all, wrapper libraries can be tremendously valuable. Yet, there is no acknowledgement of pytuning at all and when I pointed out that his tag-line degrades the hard work that was put into pytuning he doesn't even acknowledge that, instead he doubles down and shits on pytuning's usability. I don't think your comparisons make much sense either, "for humans" implies that other libraries are not for humans, i.e. for robots?! Not being someones best friend is not degrading and The Zen of Python is also not a comparative putdown in the same way as "for humans" is.
I'm bout expert at coding but "unlucky" is not defined. Just don't ask me how to write it lol
Always good to see matplotlib releases! Aww, I was hoping the layout improvements included something about legends. I remember reading somewhere that someone was working on that problem, but now I can't remember if it was matplotlib or something like seaborn. Placing a legend outside the axes on the right and gauranteeing that it fits the figure and doesn't overlap the axis is a frustrating process every time. Fiddling with font sizes and `bbox_to_anchor` feels so backwards. This is a big pain point when I'm introducing someone to using Python for engineering plots and a simple task that Excel and Matlab do without complaining is needlessly frustrating with matplotlib.
It's actually going pretty strong. Lots of stuff going up and it gives a fair chunk of data for free to everyone
I was unable to duplicate. You need to post more code also more of the error trace back. 
I dont think you watched the video, but he mentioned that python 3 has "typing" and you can "define types like integers, strings, etc..". He was comparing Python 2 to 3.
Post full code, not screenshot. It seems the exception comes from another file's line 69, not this one.
I'm just learning python myself so this may be wrong but you could try defining the resultant_if variable prior to the if/elif/else lines? Up under your x,a,b,c variables.
Matplotlib has been kicking ass recently. Nice work!
Ok.... instead of down voting me... correct my error. I did say I wasn't good at coding. Correct me if I'm wrong but c = 0 presents a problem doesn't it? 
No, it doesn't. It can't. 
Not necessary in Python. 
Being a multiple of every number...yeah I see what you're saying. Wasn't thinking
First, I would assume that mistery_value is a number. I would suggest that you should print the values/types before the if clauses to check them out. 
Ah ok. Nevertheless, for other readers, my comparison still stands.
That would raise TypeErro instead. I think the problem is somewhere else and he read it wrong in the stacktrace.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4700614/how-to-put-the-legend-out-of-the-plot/43439132#43439132 is my usual goto reference. Suggestions for a better API would be welcome.

Since Fedora 27 default interpreter is python3 and is the only installed interpreter in the base image. I raise a bug to add a symlink from python to python3 in this case at [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1630882](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1630882) but was quickly closed by quoting a phrase from [PEP 394](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0394/) which is (like most specs) bit unclear. Please comment on ticket to show your support. The spec was written \~7 years ago and mentioned that python command should point to python2 *"for the time being".* I guess in 2018 that time passed for sure and I will try to update the spec to clarify this. Not including a symlink when there is only one interpreter sounds like a serious bug to me. People should be free to argue about what to do when both are installed but if the default is already 3, we should assure that people to not have to type the extra 3. As I stated in the bug this is a big deal because it breaks ansible and is forcing people to use ugly workarounds like adding extra **ansible\_python\_interpreter=python3** to your inventory. Guess what, maybe you have a dynamic inventory where you don't even know a-priory which operating system and version you have.
Wasn't thinking.... heavily medicated right now lol

Most complaints you'll see about Windows 10 are pretty outdated. They have either been fixed or can be disabled. The only thing that I could see Mac offering over windows as far as real powerful benefits and not preference would be the Unix command line... But Windows 10 has WSL which makes that a moot point. One thing to keep in mind is that Apple products in general have users that are pretty... Dug into their ways. Apple does a good job of creating it's own ecosystem, which isn't a bad thing. It's something that many people find real benefit in, but in my experience it can lead to some poor recommendations to those who aren't bought into the Apple ecosystem.
Yeah I can set it to 10x that and I still get pixelated text. Maybe I'll have to ask separately. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1BqdQyrEshNGKluwkYnDZxptxHSxVwGnm I have the vectorized PDF format and it looks really quite crisp, and the rasterized format - png which looks nowhere near as crisp. Your PNG files look way nicer than mine! (I'm assuming they're PNG because I isolated one of your images and loaded just it and hte extension was PNG.

Hahahah shoot. Thanks I’ll delete and redo 😂 still haven’t gotten the hang of all the subreddits yet 😓 
1. /r/learnpython 2. Format your code as per the link on the sidebar of that subreddit 3. I'm fairly sure the error code you've posted does not match the code you've posted (one is `.jpg`, one is `.mov`) 4. The error message came with a traceback. Post that too. That traceback will also give you a line reference for where the error occurred. That would obviously be helpful as well. 5. Read the error message. Does that path describe a file or directory? It ends with a `/`, which means it describes a directory. Does that directory exist? I'm guessing no. That is why you're being told that the directory doesn't exist. Is any of my reasoning unclear given that error message?
you can still claim it on your resume
Don't delete. It's funny, we like funny 
No beautiful soup, scrappy? For standard you mean win32.client? 
You're going to have to explain what it is, because the readme doesn't.
Pipenv is the slowest most bulky think happened to the python community...
I disagree with the wording - "to make an improvement factor of 1,000 **in** Python". The use of **in** means "while still using python". Don't get me wrong, I know that python isn't as fast as it could be and could be sped up significantly, but it is not a fast language by design - it sacrifices speed in favour of readability and usability. You can't get that back without fundamentally changing the language, i.e. the improvement wouldn't be **in** python. Had he said **on**, it would would mean "compared to python" and his point would be valid, because you could be writing it in whatever you like.
1. /r/learnpython 2. Format your code properly (there are instructions on the sidebar in the learnpython sub). Indentation is important, especially in this example. 3. Show an example of the CSV file you're using.

Thank you! I use `tweepy` for interacting with the twitter api. The important module for Bot Ross is `NLTK`. the event bot uses `matplotlib` for plotting, `nltk` for the location extraction, and `numpy` and `sklearn` for the math and modeling. There's a few other modules I use like `re` and `datetime` and such, but they're mostly supporting modules, not key modules of either bot. Outside of that, the bots mostly use functions I wrote (read as 'copied from stack overflow').
This is actually hilarious-- after this thread he started going on a twitter rant about pipenv! And [he still doesn't give a shit](https://twitter.com/kennethreitz/status/1041951321581133825) about any of the criticism nor think he was wrong in the slightest. This pretentious egomaniac asshole can fuck himself.
it looks like 440 is hardcoded in the sawtooth generator under play.py tho, should that be parameterized too?

Impressive, well done!
Print before the line where you assign to x and you might be able to see what's wrong. Also you don't need to keep track on closing file objects when you use the with statement so the f.close() Is redundant
holy potatoes. That is impressive.
I was joking around with the idea in an IRC channel a while back. Someone suggested that the main character should be a potato. That same person also helped me name Princess Lechuga. xD
How much time did it take you to make this?
**Are you insane?** Every time someone tells me that they prefer matplotlib, I want to slap them. The API is such an utter mess and the underwhelming performance (especially for 3D) makes me wonder how can this even exist (don't start to tell me to use a different backend, it is still horrible). I hate matlab for many reasons, but plotting is what they had done right and its sole reason why I sill use matlab for a lot of work. 
You're free to use the words master/slave however you'd like. No one is stopping you. Whereas in 1984, words were literally erased from dictionaries and common vocabulary. Anyway, please continue comparing this to 1984.
Asking the real questions right there ^
It took roughly 100 hours to make and I've been working on it since August 14th. Today is also exactly 5 years since I started making games (with Python too)!
It's a freaking potato. That's so great ha ha. Love it
Okey cool i will look into it, thank you so much
Source iIncluded!? Holy moly.. might be that I get the game and do some hard studying on your code!
Awesome, congrats!
Looks really great :o 
Aw shiii! When they said "you can't do any fast/dynamic game with Python" i imagined something way slower than this. Great job, bro!
The situation is slowly improving as CPUs get better. Pygame 2 is coming soon too (based on SDL2). If Pygame 2 can make use of Intel's integrated graphics(it can only use certain GPUs atm), Python/Pygame may be viable for even larger projects. :D
I love the potato mechanics! You should add powerups like mushrooms or something but for potatos
There are special items such as a crystal that slows down time (it's used multiple times in the trailer).
100hours only? Seems so little.. did you omit some zero's. Wtf I'm still new to programming. Never imagined that making a game could take only 100hours. I've played certain video games over 1000hrs lol
I had the physics and other things pre-written for other games. The code took about 30 hours to write. The rest all went towards marketing, level design, artwork, music, etc. Python is amazing for getting stuff done fast.
That is awesome! :)
I was bored and made this… python3 -c "_=lambda ø,_=__builtins__:[vars(_)[ɤ] for ɤ in dir(_) if ø(ɤ)][0];_(lambda _:-sum(map(ord,_))^557^~0==True)(str().join(map(dir(_)[0].__class__, _(lambda _:not({_[0],r'r'}-{r'r'}))(chr(3&lt;&lt;16).encode('u\070').__len__(),True,~int()^hash(False)^1))))" 
I've wrote an uncompiler that turn assembly language into C++, and program that turns a J2ME game into a C++ game for Verizon phones, so well versed with other languages and I think Python has a nice clean syntax compared with Java/C++. The dictionaries and list slicing provides cleaner representation of fundamental data structures than exists in either C++ or Java, generators provide a very compact method for producing multiple results. My J2ME to C++ program generated make files, converted graphics (and a Visual Studio project as well, for the Windows executable). In Python I normally use PyCharm and click run, no need to set up a project. There are some features I would like in Python, mainly switch case but the overall it is one of the cleaner programming languages I've used. If the performance could match C++ it would be the only language I would ever use, but most programs don't need the extra performance boost (the programs runs 10 times slower but takes half the time to run, that is a net gain in most cases where you only run a program a few times and it only takes a few minutes to run). I want a Python to C++ converter for the times that performance is required. 
Have never heard about pygame. What are some other projects you’ve used it in? Definitely looks cool!
Hi dude, congrats. Thats a really nice game made with python. I will for sure buy it I have no experience with this site that u are selling the game . Does It allow u to update da game for who have already bought It? Like steam ? 
Is it free :D
Now _that’s_ what I call DRM-free !
I have no idea how or where to play this and have no idea about how to use the pygame package, but I'm going to buy this simply because you've included the source code. I'll see how badly i can break it
Who done the pixel art? Also how does one go about learning to make games like this with the NES/SNES vibe?
How far are you away from that goal? I could probably help out a bit :) 
Bought and followed! :) I love the idea, and reading you did all by yourself makes it even more impressive! Keep playing! 
Sorry, but no. It's only $3.99 though. :P It's available here: https://cmlsc.itch.io/super-potato-bruh
Just had a few more purchases and I'm at $30 (after 3 hours). The goal is to see how far I can get on a $0 budget. xD
I did the everything. (artwork, music, code, sfx, etc.) If you're asking about making pixel art, I mostly figured it out by looking at other stuff. Probably not the most efficient way of learning, but if you add that to 5 years of practice, it goes a long way.

I'm not sure what you mean by "control widgets", but I'm guessing it's some kind of prebuilt framework for whatever you're used to. For Pygame, I just render images at certain coordinates every frame. I built my framework myself. I have made top down games, but I haven't released any. However, I did make an [isometric game using Python/Pygame](https://cmlsc.itch.io/whirling-blades).
Mind sharing the code? I'd be interested in seeing how you approached this. I've been trying to do some similar for testing chatbots. &amp;#x200B;
Too late 😅😂 
I do a fair amount of acoustic propagation modeling, and it's not uncommon for me to have the phase shift of some signal varying across a 2d surface.
Yeah, it's meant to. It's part of an in-game joke. Each food has a little bit of lore you can read about after you get to the world that they're in.
Can't share it (it's for my work) but I can describe it. In this case, I'm just taking API requests, grabbing the responses, converting the json into a more readable format, and then creating the validation. I make sure the response code is the same, the response time is no more than 50% higher, and the json responses are the same. With the json responses, I have a list of variables, and I make sure that the variable names replace their values in the json. Then it's just a matter of print statements. Result looks like this: expect(response.status_code).to(equal(200)) expect(response.elapsed.total_seconds()).to(be_below(0.8)) expect(response_json['created_by/url']).to(equal(env['BaseUrl'] + "/projects/" + projectUID + "/users/" + env['userUID']))
Its a good write-up. I'd personally always recommend absolute imports.

Thanks for the source!
Badass thanks for the info. I’d like to make hobby games and release them but I’ve always been daunted by using unity or some their engine, this is useful info! I appreciate it.
I will never not upvote Super Potato Bruh!
So you said you had the physics pre-written. Could you estimate how long that was?.. I'm just curious in general the workload needed from a to z of making my own game of this level
All the scripts that I already had before development probably have about 15 hours of work put into them. Although the number is higher than it should be because a lot of that time was from various changes I've made. (Including redoing the whole thing a couple times.)
Looks super bruh! What's your opinions on pygame vs the other newer libs?
Getting this because Princess Lechuga made me giggle. 
Is this what you were referring to [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/8u9zba/cool_new_features_in_python_37_real_python/e1e5r6b/)?
I honestly haven't tried many. I think Pygame is great, but it's also really slow (because it doesn't use the GPU). It's very basic, which makes development quick and easy. However, the downside of that is that it doesn't really support GFX, lighting, etc.. I've made my own scripts to do a raycast style lighting and it works fine, but only at lower resolutions. The bottleneck on it is the blitting speeds, not the raycasting itself. Fortunately Pygame 2 (in development, not released) uses SDL2 and may work with more GPUs, which would make Pygame viable for large projects.
Is there no OpenGL support?
Ah, more Kenneth circlejerkery. Lovely.
Music seems great
Thanks! My personal favorite was World 4's music. It was used a lot in the trailer, so you've probably heard it.
You made this in under a month?!?! I'm blown away - awesome work sir. 
Thanks!
I'm curious how you went about blitting everything. Especially with a large background layer, parallax layers, tiles, and sprites, did you have to do fancy tricks to keep the framerate up or just use pygame's sprite batching functions? I've done a lot of things with python ([my youtube channel with random things I've played with](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPIeXF_162yPYxyllmh5l8Q)), but the rendering speed is what always took the most effort. So much so that I started using pypy with sdl/cffi to great effect, though it's still kept my NES emulator from hitting full speed with sound.
Allen Bradley. Mainly because that is what I'm used to. The software is way more polished than GE and they are ahead in functionality. If you're using Citect SCADA, and maybe others, with GE PLCs you have to address all your tags to registers and maintaining that it a pain in the arse. Development time would be more than double for me writing in GE versus AB. I'm changing jobs at the moment manily because I don't want to work with the GE PLCs. I have never used Siemens, I hear the latest incarnation is quite nice, and only touched one old Modicon and one Redlion. Other people will say Siemens because that is what they were raised on, others Modicon, but I don't have the experience with them to comment.

It really helps that the display is actually 400x250 pixels. It's scaled up, so less is blitted. It's also important to use `.convert()` on all of the images for faster blitting speeds. I only render what's on screen too, but I don't know if you assumed I did that by default or not.
That makes sense for something like a room. My frequency processing is more for 3D models. I plot complex mode shapes by sweeping the phase and adding it to the nominal phase angle.
That makes sense, and I did assume you'd only render what's visible; it's so very necessary with python/pygame. I've done some pretty smooth tile engines before with pygame, using a surface of tiles a couple tiles wider/higher than what shows on screen and using a fine x/y offset to blit it and decide when it needs to be updated, only redrawing the tiles that changed (using a buffer array). Sadly the implementation of pygame in pypy is buggy. Scaling a surface has a huge memory leak that I wasn't able to work around easily. I took to accessing the _c_surface.pixels buffer directly and holding a back-buffer array to compare color values against, and only update if needed. You can also supply a pixel scale to it, and it will instead use an SDL_rect object to blit larger pixels, which is faster than pygame's rect implementation. I just use a single rect and change it's x,y,w,h values to that of the pixel being drawn. This really helped allow me to reach near full NES emulation speed using "slow" python.
I am really impressed to read that is was done with pygame, it makes me want to give it another try! By the way, how did you manage to package the game for distribution? Last time I tried I had a bit of pain trying to package everything right
cx_freeze for Windows and pyinstaller for Linux. Pyinstaller works for both, but cx_freeze makes smaller files. :D
Just look up how to use the range **function** (I don't think anyone here can explain it better than Google can)

His tagline is not the problem though. I's innocent. Maybe you have a problem with the way he takes criticism but that has more to do with his personality, not the tagline itself. 
The [PyAudio][https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio] module will let you play audio as a stream of bytes (standard WAV format, PCM audio). The "audio bytes" can come from anywhere, read from a file, recorded from a microphone, or created from a math function.
The best way to use `unittest` is to put it down and use `pytest` instead.
"Pygame 2 is coming soon." That sounds pretty hopeful. Do you have any specific timeline to share in relation to that? I did some googling, and it looks like things are at the same state they seemed to be, ~x years ago.
I only know stuff from talking to some of the people that I believe are working on it. I have no clue when it'll be done. I'm pretty sure it was recently advertised on the Pygame twitter account.
\&gt;I did the everything. I love this.
Where can I buy it?

Thank you for your reply. I had not heard that PyAudio could use a stream instead of a file, so I will be certain to look into this. Thank you very much for your help!
Have you read the docs? It goes into some pretty decent detail throughout the Quick Guide and then through the various class and method documentation. https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html Also check out r/learnpython
Even better, check out the beautiful and perceptually-uniform [`cmoceans` colormaps](https://matplotlib.org/cmocean/). I used HSV for direction in my thesis plots, and I wish this had existed back then!
How long did it take to make? I think I remember a thread where you said you be been working on it a no th, but that seems unrealistic given how polished it is.
This is awesome! Is there any reason why this couldn’t be installed or ran on a Mac?
I'm planning on a Mac release, but some college stuff got in the way and I didn't have time to get it done before the release date.
So cool and MEGA impressive. Damn dude! Getting it ASAP!
Thank you! :D
This sounds like a pretty good product. How do you get the data on which bars are inclusive? Do you parse reviews from yelp/whatever review site or you do check for places with certain features?
No worries. Congratulations on the great work! Just downloaded it and looking forward to giving it a go!
do you leverage any libraries or you built it all from scratch?
How do you define polarity in your analysis? It could be possible that your are looking at posts from subreddits where titles give no value.
[simpleaudio](https://pypi.org/project/simpleaudio/) is able to play from [buffers](https://simpleaudio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html) such as `bytes` objects, numpy data structures and whatnot. It is not preinstalled, but, if my memory serves, has no dependencies besides Python itself.
If x,y are still floats, you need to use str(x) and str(y) when concatenating. 
Could also use string formatting... `print "({0},{1})".format(x,y)` Might even use `{0:.3f}` to control the number of decimal places on the floats.
Great work! I’m buying this tomorrow. #1 as a dad, I can’t wait to show your game my kids ages 3, 5 and 7. #2 as a full time backend developer, I’m excited to dig into the code and geek out and to share tidbits with my kids. 
Thanks! I hope your kids enjoy it. :D I think $4 is a good price. I've only had a couple purchases that didn't have this thread listed as the referrer. Most people I know in real life (that play lots of video games) think that $4 is bordering on a bit too much.
I took 8 years of piano lessons and I forgot almost everything. I don't really know what I'm doing. :P
Formatting worked. Thank you. 
Formatting worked thank you. Just in case someone else needs this help, I ended up doing print "({0},{1}) this is my point".format(x,y) 
Brilliant project. Had to purchase when I saw the source was included so I can see what actually goes into making something so in depth that I'm playing. Really appreciated!
Is it done, Yuri?
Jeez, dude. Start by reading the sidebar. It will point you to /r/learnpython. Read THAT sidebar. Also, how did you not bother to look at khan academy's python offerings?
It’s the latter, though parsing reviews might be a good idea. I haven’t come up with a coherent evaluation methodology yet, so I still need to research this topic before making any conclusions 
Mr Ladle made me laugh more than he should have
Yeah I have done that with VSCode. The script runs on the server
With debugging locally ?
I think for $4 your price was a good decision for a first release. I can see you doing bigger things in the future though that would warrant much more, especially with the popularity you'll gain from this, and the skills you have that can be used towards an even bigger project.
We have /r/learnpython in the sidebar
Ah thanks I’m on narwhal mobile can’t see the sidebar :)
Nah. The 3rd enemy is literally called a “Beef Moocow”. There’s also spam.
This looks awesome! I looked at the game page, and saw it runs on Win and Linux. Is there support for Mac, or a way to cross compile it?
Thanks Dev for responding
I’m planning on packaging for Mac in the future. Someone said something about Mac having Wine though, so you may be able to use that.
You are an inspiration!
Yeah but I consider it a minor issue. Doing a ```bash ~ python -m venv ``` Is not really time consuming 😉
Extracting a few million records to a csv file, the server was giving a socket.timeout every 400000 or so records and could only extract 10000 records at a time. I wrote a script to handle the timeout so I don't have to check periodically for it to finish extracting. Also using enumerate to compare the records with the master file. They were using excel ODATA to compare previously and Excel crashes when the records gotten too large.
why python programming got better when I installed Solus/Linux tbh. I was forced to complete many operations that were easy in Windows (like reading files in an iPhone)
Yeah you can set breakpoints locally and attach the debugger to the remote script. Just Google remote debugging with VSCode
&gt;tch rename VO files. Here's a video of me demonstrating it: &gt; &gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdAhiFvgfDo oh wow that's really useful for lecture recordings
Type faster? 
Multiple linear regression is actually a common feature of machine learning. Try using Tensorflow. It integrates perfectly with numpy data structures. For even better performance I would highly recommend Mxnet. Mxnet is just all round faster, and has superior memory management if working with massive datasets but isn't quite as easy to use as Tensorflow nor does it have as many learning resources. For a lot of Cuda and GPU computation tasks, using Machine Learning libraries is often the easiest way to do it. 
I was wanting to do something just like this, great first part. How often are you doing these streams? Where can I see more?
Looks awesome! Insta-bought it. Cheers!
Don't check the mind box images in egg folder. It's laments configuration and AFAIK not something you'd like to have on your pc, or image cache folder... 
&gt;remote Yep finally got it to work with ptvsd. Thanks!
Java is to javascript is very important, Javascript was designed to be complimentary to Java, and name selected to reflect that. A master orders, a slave obeys terminology is simple. Essentially slavery might be a problematic word due to your history but here in Turkey we dislike slave and slavery equally. You can never find a usage for köle or kölelik with a normalized meaning. We do have a normalized use of master which is "farmers are the masters of society". Think global, not local :)

Working on the mac from source code using python 3.7 :)
Super easy to run it from the included source on the Mac. Worked for me using python3.7. 
Thank you
**The state pattern tries to deal with common state issues by making it immutable and utilizing copy-on-write.** This pattern kind of emerged for me out of necessity while working with databases. I had inherited quite a bit of code that was analyzing, creating, editing, and removing data, all in a couple of quite large, borderline godlike, functions. I can't get into too much detail, but more often than not, the same bit of data was fetched over and over, making it slow. Sometimes bits of the code was working on data that had already been edited by other bits of the code, and whenever there was an error, it tended to leave the data in a very iffy state. I did not like this one bit. **Example usage:** from statepattern import State as S def get_data(): # Return some data from the db. return None def modify_data(state: S) -&gt; S: # Modify the data. return state.assign(edits=[1, 2, 3]) def validate_data(state: S) -&gt; S: # Validate the changes. return state.assign(valid=True) def store_data(state: S) -&gt; S: if state.valid: # Store the now edited data. return state result = ( S(data=get_data()) .then(modify_data) .then(validate_data) .then(store_data) )

Wow, very good work! I will buy to support 
Idk if you mind or not but could you help me getting past the ws.something url. It keeps saying auth failed but Im using the same headers as before..
It's escaping it. The best thing to do is to open up the repl and test what happens if you don't.
&gt;And if you rewrote it in hand-rolled assembly it'd be even faster than C, which is why nobody writes anything in C. Quite possibly not; C compilers and the people who write them are often better than us mere mortals at writing ASM.
As DasWood said : - \ - is escaping the character In your case you need to escape because you used ' to identify the string and there were also a ' inside your regex. To put ' inside your regex rule, you had to escape it :) Without escaping \' : re.sub("[,.']","" ,string)
Looks really cool and giving away the source with the game is a really cool move too. So I bought it. Now I must be a dummy but I can move up and down the main menu but can't start playing, no menu item responds to Enter, or Space, or Tab, or any other key... Help?
I will be sure to try that, so thank you so much!
cool! i'll explore pytest later :D
You're right. This is not a safe way. In fact, I have done my work before I found that "Flickr provide API". All you have to do is do register. So, I'll try to make new version in a few weeks. Thanks for advice.
I looked through the code you wrote for the current version, and let me say – I think you did a great job with this project, even if the approach maybe wasn't right, and I'm very much looking forward to your next post! :)
Congratulations, matplotlib is a fantastic tool that every scientist should have in their toolkit
No,I think I'm silly. I didn't know API key is available before my work was done.
Yeah, I forgot to let the player know that in the game. I put the controls in the text that’s on the game page. I plan on fixing it in the first update.
I’m not sure. October is going to get pretty crazy for me.
oh wow, awesome. looks too hard for me though
I say yes. Although Pygame has some tight graphical limits.

Very nice.! 😊😊😊
Yea but still... this is the pointless part. Sync in thread available using async syntax. That's a horrible case. Actual async IO is the REAL answer.
Yeah this is something I regularly use the wrong wording for, just a habit from using actually typed languages I suppose. I'll be more careful around the wording of this in future, understand how that could be confusing
Ya I will have to check tonight cause I’m not by my computer 
The source comes with the game and it all costs around $4!

You can get very very far with a traditional RDBMS and polling. There are lots of ways to optimise the RDBMS solution. It doesn't have to be dumbest possible implementation. Most of those companies that I mentioned deal with low numbers. They often have bottlenecks elsewhere or other crap code. Instead of fixing those issues they instantly pick the heaviest tool they can find thinking that's going to "help them the most". You can start with lightweight solutions and bump it only after you have legitimately verified that you do need something more fancy. I don't use Kafka unless I really really absolutely fucking have to. Before that you can try: - RDBMS, you can get very far with this if you know what you are doing - Beanstalkd, Gearman, Redis - RabbitMQ - Managed services like AWS SQS
Most important thing for me: the *incredible* trackpad
omg it works with python 3 now. I remember checking it every couple months just to see if it ever got support for it. For the longest time it was just python 2
That's an interesting take on things. It's always great to hear how things work outside of western society. In IT, master/slave doesn't work the way you described, though. Take the SPI protocol for example. I reference that a lot because it makes use of the terminology very heavily. The pin out is like this: SCLK MOSI MISO SS where SCLK is the clock; MOSI is Master Out/Slave In; MISO is Master In/Slave Out; and SS is Slave Select. The master and slave communicate equally. Laid out hierarchically, the "master" would be at the same level, just centrally located. The "slaves" are just given turns to talk (via SS pin). So, there's no "imperative to obey" or anything like that. It doesn't bear any semblance to human enslavement. SPI is far from the only example, too. I just think that it's a slippery slope and a lot of other loose connections might be made, exacerbating the counterproductive situation I see happening already. In all cases though, I'm not opposed to any change, I just think a modicum of consideration should be made. From what I hear, the committee (or Russom, himself) was a little knee-jerk in making the decision. 
I had the same experience. It feels like a bad clone of R-Studio.

I think it just installs the package. If you're in a venv, it will install in the venv. If you're in normal mode, it will globally install.
