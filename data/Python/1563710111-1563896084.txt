I would agree if you are referring to all of the alt coins that have popped up over the years, but bitcoin is the real deal. Don't just parrot what you hear. Educate yourself on the technology itself. Most people who get burned are just trying to make a quick buck without understanding what they are doing. Good job OP, not sure how far along you are but you may want to bring this up on r/bitcoin.
Raspberry Pi isn't a microprocessor.

Thank you! Right now it is not very tested by anyone but me and my friends, but the core is done, web interface is done and bitcoin support is here, right now I am adding support of bitcoin lightning network in it and then will improve docker packaging. It really needs to be tested, but I think it is already quite stable. I will update on the progress here. I will brint it to r/bitcoin in a few hours to don't post in two communities at once.
Feel free to contact, i develop those.... I don't mind helping
ü§î Wonder what changed? Anyway, good luck.
If you use NumPy arrays then you can use Numba vectorize and enable multicore computation. That will be on par, if not faster than a naive C/C++ implementation as well.
Whatever he does, he should choose something that is reasonable to complete within the allotted time. Without knowing the time-frame, it's hard to make any good recommendations. Maybe something like a plug &amp; play network mapper? As mentioned in another reply, the Pi isn't a microprocessor, but a [SoC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip).
Why are you trying to avoid nmap, exactly? nmap is an excellent tool with a very long history. Designing another app that performs the types of tasks that nmap performs - only worse and less reliably! - is not a productive use of time. Incidentally, that piece of advice comes from my experience with my own network scanning project, because I've been down the road you're traveling now. After studying nmap's capabilities, I decided to build my scanner on top of nmap, which allowed me to leverage its capabilities for my own uses.
i thought that was a completely different object initially.
To make pylint shut up about unused variables, name it unused_*
 import shutil import os for file in os.listdir('C:/Users/howardcruze/Downloads/'): if file.endswith(".package"): shutil.move(rf'C:/Users/howardcruze/Downloads/{file}','C:/Users/howardcruze/Desktop') Here I think this will do it, just replace the three locations with your own.
I‚Äôm making this for my project in college and if I use nmap, there‚Äôs no sense. I mean, they will probably see as if I only made a GUI for nmap, nothing else. I think it would probably be a strong point if I can make this project without nmap.

The self keyword is a way of referencing instances without having a specific memory address. Ie before it has been instantiated.
What would happen if you didn‚Äôt use self
It depends on the application but self is a fundamental principle of object oriented design, so I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs hard to avoid.
Still don‚Äôt get it
&gt; They will probably see as if I only made a GUI for nmap, nothing else. Three pieces of insight for you. First: The first release of nmap was in 1997. It may be *older than you* and has been in continuous development since then. What are the odds that in a semester or whatever, your homebrew network scanner will present anywhere near the capability of a high-profile project that has been in development for *22 years?* Second: Just like any good tool, nmap presents a set of basic capabilities. It is not a full-fledged network scanner, in the sense that computer engineers and software developers mean. It does not scan on a schedule. It does not compare capabilities of a particular device over invocations. It does not track capabilities and device behavior over time. It does not log results. It does not compare results with a trusted device list, and notify a user upon detecting changes. Etc. There is a ton, *a ton*, of functionality that you can build on top of the basic information reported by nmap. And the functionality that you can design *on top of nmap* goes far beyond the niceties of a graphical front end - well into the realm of network security. Third: You haven't posted the details of your assignment for college, so I don't know the rubric. If your instructor expects you to build a basic network scanner as an nmap alternative - then, fine, do that. But if the assignment is open-ended, like "design something in the field of network scanning" (or if there isn't an actual assignment and this is just your own project) - then your time will be much better spent *not* reinventing the wheel, and instead doing something interesting with wheels that already exist. Keep in mind that reusing existing tools is a recognized and valuable skill in computer science and computer engineering! When a machine vision designer embarks on a machine vision project, the first thing they do isn't to design a machine vision framework - they take opencv and they do something useful with it.
My only reason for using pygame is that it was the easiest way to load images and add the zoom box (the thing around the cursor). It works well for any projects where you don‚Äôt just need a rudimentary GUI (tkinter or pyqt are a couple libraries that work well for that).
I see a lot of people creating mandlebrot relatet python projects. But why tho?
Yeah I definitely want to speed this up. The biggest culprits are computation time (I‚Äôm using python with numba‚Äôs JiT compiler) and reinitializing the pygame window so it will reload the updated image.
At least in my case it was to test my skills in python and my ability to learn a math concept and apply it to code without looking at other examples. It may not be the most practical but it helped me to learn a lot about numba, pygame, and more ins and outs of python.
So why does self have to be passed in? How is it different than ‚Äúthis‚Äù in C++?
My personal list of good habits: 1. Get used to reading documentation and not only finding responses in StackOverflow (SO). Getting used to reading docs will come very handy when you start advanced programming. 2. When posting in a website/forum, read the rules. Check the bot comment, you will see that this is not quite the place to ask questions (I'm actually giving you a tip, the programming community can be very salty with the whole "rules stuff"). 3. When in doubt about coding style, check PEP 8. 4. Always search for responses before asking questions online. I'm sure that there are plenty of articles about learning python, programming and etc online. Again, trying to be a cool guy here and help you not getting insulted over too little :) 5. If you know how to read documentation, search for answers and when to ask questions, you have come a long way already. Believe or not, people only learn to do these things after quite some time programming. My big advice to learn programming is: create something that will be useful to you. I, for one, have created this app: https://github.com/matuzalemmuller/frevo. This was a short project, but it was very safistifying to create an actual application and it helped me understand how to create GUIs in Python using PyQt. 6. Data structures! This is more advanced and you should learn when you are "fluent" in the basics of the programming language. Very, very important. Hope I was able to help. I think that you wanted more of a technical guidance, but honestly, learning how to be a good programmer is much more important than learning how to program well. Good luck in your projects! PS: I'm typing this from mobile, sorry for any mistakes.

Python 3.8 is still in beta. You'll need to enable the `pre-3.8` channel (`conda config --add channels pre-3.8`).
What‚Äôs the command to create a 3.8 environment following this one?
I‚Äôve just ran this and it shows pre 3.8 in my channels. But when I run ‚Äúconda create -n myenv python=3.8‚Äù It says UnavailableInvalidChannel: the channel is not accessible or is invalid
`conda create` lets you specify package versions on the command line, so you'll do `conda create python=3.8`.
Unfortunately that doesn't work atm, the pre-.3.8 link is defunct
I was working on getting surveys about information security up (made with Django): https://surveys.redandblack.io Looking for any developers, engineers and ops people for one, and anyone who uses the internet for the other. Next, analysing the results :)
For me the largest part of PyCharm is that it is actually an IDE. If you add type annotations to your code it will understand it and highlight potential bugs and autocomplete and refactoring will work correctly.
The 3.8 packages are on the conda-forge community repo tagged `pre-3.8`. Looks like conda-forge packages are all available as a single channel `conda-forge`, not as a separate channel for each tag like I'd assumed. Try removing the `pre-3.8` channel name and adding `conda-forge` as a channel name.
Don't rush into buying any books. Some are good, others not so good and yet others are available for free online. Do your research, read the reviews, ask here and in r/learnpython if not sure!
I've done that just now but conda create with pre-3.8 still doesn't work. I don't mean to sound rude but could you please devise a solution and get it running on your end first? Hopefully it shouldn't be too hard in this case, I'm just very new to all this
So what is the purpose of this project ? Are there any benefits in using what you have created ? Don't get me wrong please, but I can't find a motivation to create something like that.I might be wrong as I don't know many details about the projects so feel free to explain it to me if you want, of course.
zsh makes this less painful, it adds a new line if one was missing and places a marker so you can still tell.
Mind you, channel url: [https://conda.anaconda.org/pre-3.8](https://conda.anaconda.org/pre-3.8) leads to ### The user, pre-3.8, you are looking for cannot be found.

After a brief look a few things come to mind. Great job it looks like the beginnings of a great tool! Set debug=False in production. It could cause security issues. Also it appears you are using SQLite. That‚Äôs not a good database for production. It‚Äôs only for testing/dev. I‚Äôd suggest adding default parameters so anyone can run a search. Remove as much user friction as possible. A quick start guide would be nice. Hope it helps!
Looks great man! Thanks a lot for the clarification. Will definitely star it on GitHub!
lambda isn't a database, it's "functions as a service". you give it code and say "run this function whenever triggered". it scales """infinitely""" by filling resource gaps across their infrastructure. they limit concurrent executions to 1000 by default, but you can request an increase. the main limiter on lambda is cpu/memory and disk space. you select your max memory usage and it scales your max cpu to match. iirc it ranges from 128MB to 3GB. your available space in /tmp is limited to 512MB. so if you wanted to manage billions of rows, you would write your lambda code to extract small subsets and process them. then you would launch 100s of instances that code. or write it to sit mid-stream and aggregate or modify data on its way to the db.
Spark is probably your best bet at that scale.

Thank you so much for your reply. Can I have it done in the digitalocean server?
Found the official answer at https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/python. The channel name you need is `conda-forge/label/pre-3.8`.
Yes.
And yes, I tested it this time. $ conda config --add channels conda-forge/label/pre-3.8 $ conda create -n &lt;your choice of environment name&gt; python=3.8 I got a working environment with Python 3.8a3.
can you please check what sqlite version you have in that python? my aim is 3.25+
Thanks ton! Books are like food for Mind. It's more tasty and healthy when Free ;)
No. I've already done as much unpaid work as I want to do today. If you need a version of sqlite that isn't in the default repositories, somebody has probably shared a build on conda-forge. Now that we know that the translation from conda-forge label to channel name is `conda-forge/label/foo`, you shouldn't need any more help to find it if it's there.

Dynamic setup.py files work quite well. My dependencies vary with python version due to minor dependency issues. That lets me use the widest range of packages I can with a project. It also means I can import the package and see if you meet the requirements, so I can reduce the workload on setuptools, so it installs faster. I do have a backup If one of them fails to install, which is to run a setup_no_reqs.py file, which still calculates the dependencies, but doesn‚Äôt install them. They print out at the end, but you‚Äôre a big kid, so you can fix it. Shoot, a package can be quite large, so while you don‚Äôt meet the requirements for 100% of issues, it will probably still work. Not everything requires all of your dependencies.
The code you mention is inside the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block, which won't be executed on PythonAnywhere -- even outside PythonAnywhere, it would only be executed once, when your website starts up. Should it not be inside your Twilio webhook handler view?
Nice! Now you just need to add in a coefficient of restitution so the poor thing can stop bouncing!

You can just use vanilla JS‚Äôs fetch or jQuery‚Äôs ajax method on the front end and normal Flask on the backend.

How do you do the graphics?
....and like a Python we all devour the tasty books then sit and digest it.
Wow mate thats extremly cool! I want more info and the source code!!!!! Which libraries did you use? What physics did you use??
Have you tried to calculate any dynamically stable Lissajous orbits around Lagrange points? I think the L4/L5 ones are the ones with dynamically stable orbits for certain mass cases? The others require corrections to stay stable.
However, if it never gives off any kinetic energy to the glass breaking or any other damage you just have this thing bouncing silently in a corner. You can just pick it up and everything is fine. Maybe add a wireless charger for extra convenience. When you come home, just throw your phone in there and pick it up when you need it.
This is why phone cases are not made out of Super bouncy ball material.
I used to love the stdlib argparser but I recently switched to Click and I'm totally sold.
I tried out AR.js and it worked really well. My main thought is whether to go straight for the webxr approaches by Mozilla et al.
But you did no looking yourself. Because if you type ‚Äúpython google search‚Äù into google search, it comes up with a bunch of tutorials on using the google module to perform google searches and some even cover using beautiful soup to parse the results. An AI project will take forever if you don‚Äôt at least put the bare minimum effort into trying to figure out your problems yourself.
Can you publish the code? If it's opensource?
Which laws of physics did you take into account?
Just a few days ago finished up a program that sets up servers, runs them through setup, grabs drivers, loads up hardware tests etc It was mostly some housekeeping because we put off updating Python for a while and some stuff would have been broken, finally got around to it over the last 2 weeks

any chance youll release the code? I'm working on something similar for generating these geometries but have nothing for running any analysis on them besides commercial codes
here is the code! [link to github](https://github.com/mbecker20/block_collide) if you are interested in running it, all the files must be in the same folder, and you must have ffmpeg installed to write the mp4. In main.py, you can change block.animate2(....) to block.animate(....) to create just the axes, or just run animate2 to see the how values for kinetic (top) and potential (bottom) energy change as the block bounces. You can also mess with the initial conditions although changing Elc to anything other than 1 usually causes errors
It seems something is missing.. Maybe conservation of linear momentum as the object doesn't translate in x or y.
If you have not already done so, have a look at [JeanFrancoisPuget's "How To Quickly Compute The Mandelbrot Set In Python"](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/jfp/entry/How_To_Compute_Mandelbrodt_Set_Quickly?lang=en).
Definitely! I wanted to get this stable bounce first though. The conditionals for the collision become more difficult as the block gets closer and closer to being at rest on the surface, often resulting in sinking/jittering
done
This is amazing. Really inspirational
Cheaper than redshift clusters?
The collision assumes the delta v from the collision is in the the z direction, normal to the floor. This does not conserve linear momentum as the floor does not move, it basically has infinite mass so momentum conservation of the system becomes meaningless. The blocks x and momentum stay and remain 0, as the momentums of the points about the blocks center of mass all cancel out.
I found matplotlib animation way too unwieldy and now use moviepy to create plot animations
Depends what you‚Äôre trying to do and where it‚Äôll fit in the stack. Redshift has stateful storage, while spark is strictly compute. Redshift operates almost exclusively on tabular data, while spark can operate on tabular data and graph style data.
Interesting, could you share any sources you may have on Spark costs? Definitely want to look into this
I'll definitely look into that. How is the speed?
I could watch this all day
Sure, AWS has managed services for Spark. EMR (Elastic Map Reduce) and AWS Glue (Serverless ETL offering). Both of which have very detailed pricing layouts, much better than I can relay here.
Thanks for taking the time to look! I'll take these into account. What would you recommend for a database that would be easy to integrate? And by reducing user friction, do you want the user to be able to directly write SQL / query the database?
I've made a 2D physics engine and have the same issue with sinking. If you do get a solution working, can you let me know please?
Decent enough
I've been thinking about an 'on_surface' bool attribute to the nodes that can flip to true and cancel out gravity with a normal force.

Your example of what it would desugar to isn't the recommended workaround, nor is it delayed evaluation, so I'm not really sure what your point is. I'm saying that this: @fix_mutable_defaults # stand-in for whatever the actual syntax would be def bar(a, b, l=[]): ... Would desugar to this: def bar(a, b, l=None): if l is None: l = [] ... With this desugaring, - Default arguments are re-evaluated each time the function is called, which fixes the issue at hand. - The default value is evaluated inside the function body, so "any codebase that either uses the variable a or imports a dependency that uses the variable a" wouldn't be able to break anything. - Non-defaulted arguments aren't affected by the change, so it's not "impossible to pass mutable arguments into functions."

Depends on your line of work to be honest. I deal with physical simulations all day and AR allows me to visualize my data in an unrestricted way and makes it easier to understand the spatial structure. Visualizing data is crucial towards building an intuition between the simulation parameters and the outcome.
Haven't tried webxr before. Is it similar to aframe?
Very cool! Can you input the rebound coefficient as a variable and see what happens?
My advice is: don't pay for python courses. Everything you need is freely available, and there are tons of free books/courses on the web. I'm on mobile right now, but hit me with a DM of your want pointers later. With your background, python is simple enough that you'll have no problem plowing through.
As far as I can tell it builds on a-frame. The key difference is in the scene management model so it can support AR or VR. To me that solves many of the issues I have. I wanted to put together a sort of walking tour of our university. The QR code concept from AR.js was perfect but it then meant I didn't have a way for people not at the exhibit to interact. When I discovered webXR it seemed to address this issue and the problem of going platform agnostic.
When I worked in finance, there were no Macs around because we lived in Excel. Is that different for developer jobs on Wall Street? I know that I'm going to need to use Excel again so does it make sense to learn OSX?
That's pretty cool! Is it me or is it gaining energy and bouncing higher? This is a common problem when using a naive integrator like Euler.

Energy goes into rotation, when it's rotating more, it goes less high, and vice versa. I've been analyzing the energy throughout and it is stable in the same range. This uses rk4 for rotation and a simple fast corrected method for moving the center of mass position. I am honestly still figuring out how energy is moving around.
Don‚Äôt lol
Couldn't you just add a decay/timestep to the velocity if the distance of any point to the surface is below a given treshold? That's how I modeled decaying orbits (well with a decay every timestep, without distance to a surface :D ) and it worked great.
I don't have any experience with trying to code on iOS, but if you're up for learning some Linux, you could set up a Coder server. Instead of trying to find a way to code on your iPad, set up dependencies locally, and use ssh/ftp/git to send files to a remote, you could configure the dependencies on a remote server along with: https://github.com/cdr/code-server then you can connect to the IDE via the browser. The upside is that you don't have to pay for the IDE, and you know that you'll be able to install whatever you need and can scale your hardware to meet your needs. The downside is that you'll have to rent a cloud VM whenever you want to write some code, unless you already own some hardware you can use in that way.
I'm a physics student and rotational dynamics fascinates me. I had this idea and some free time and here we are

Really interesting, but Must have screwed something up because when I tried running the number recognition algorithm against my own 28x28 images that I created, most of the time it says the result is the number '3' even though I created images of me drawing numbers from 1 to 9 (with a couple of extra variation for 7 and 4. Occasionally it said a number was 5 but the vast majority of the time the number was wrong. Anything special you have to do with creating the 28x28 images - transparent background? white background?
The idea of my phone falling and bouncing forever is giving me a mild anxiety attack. Nice simulation, but please, don't make such a simulation ever again. I reckon Satan just added this simulation to his tool belt of torture devices. Yeah, for sure.

Pytorch-transformers they have a BERT, GPT2, and several other transformer models that can be used for sentence generation

Take a look at OSMNX (which uses openstreetmap), might give you some ideas
Even better: &lt;code&gt; def make\_dict(name, bases, mapping): del mapping\['\_\_module\_\_'\] del mapping\['\_\_qualname\_\_'\] return mapping class config(metaclass=make\_dict): app = 'wikiapp' owner = 'dapriorr' cores = 4 cron = 'weekly' security = 'high' config {'app': 'wikiapp', 'owner': 'dapryor', 'cores': 4, 'cron': 'weekly', 'security': 'high'} &lt;/code&gt;

I don't think that's what OP aims for. This only works if you have control over the definition of the class of the object and you don't want to use any OOP features. Also my point wasn't providing the best way to perform serialisation of an object but giving food for thoughts to OP.
To be clear I still use matplotlib to draw the frames just use moviepy to put them together
Addendum, if you have access to the server where P-SQL is installed, you can install/run an instance of Adminer somewhere out in the cloud, which is a web-based SQL client. https://www.adminer.org/ `docker run -p80:80 adminer`

This is very inaccurate. My phone has only ever fallen flat on its face, no bounce, for maximum screen destruction.
I‚Äôm not a dev, but spend an inordinate amount of time coding in my role on Wall St, I‚Äôve found that proficiency in Python, Excel and a little bit of SQL is generally more than enough to satisfy the job requirements for most use cases. Most Wall St. banks have tool sets internally developed for valuations, and its been invaluable to be able to work with that data outside of excel and then to save the model output to CSV/XML to be used elsewhere for less technical individuals.
If anyone doesn't understand why this wouldn't work, it's because division in Python will convert integers into double precision floats, which have a finite number of digits. The other part of the joke is trying to reverse the float with [::-1]. This operation can only be performed on sequences, not numerical types. The correct way to do this would be: ```python str(22/7)[::-1] ``` (Sorry for "explaining the joke", just wanted to inform anyone that didn't get it)

This gives me great anxiety
What is the reason to work with all 5gb of data? If you are doing this for some machine learning algorithm then I would suggest splitting the 5gb into smaller sets of train and test data and hold a control. Outside of that, you have my curiosity peaked.
The code and some rundown of how I did it is here. [http://www.philipzucker.com/annihilating-my-friend-will-with-a-python-fluid-simulation-like-the-cur-he-is/](http://www.philipzucker.com/annihilating-my-friend-will-with-a-python-fluid-simulation-like-the-cur-he-is/) It's surprisingly short and easy I think. Numpy and scipy for the win!
looks like a dude breakdancing
Well I guess it comes down to two things: (and yes, ultimately trying to extract insight about value and ratings from a large set of reviews) 1. I didn't think sklearn could handle aggregating multiple models together. If you train on several separately, I'm not really sure how to code to join them. I'm guessing majority voting, but I haven't really spent time on that - so I'd have to learn that or dask. I don't think a sklearn pipeline would work here as I'm not using the output from model x to feed into model y or z. 2. With the dask pandas and sklearn APis, I could vectorize (Gensim or something) reviews and all that good stuff straight from there. It's a little slower, but I know pandas and sklearn in this context, so it shouldn't pose issues. However, I am getting problems doing very basic things, like a Series max. It actually worked on Win10, but when I swapped over to Ubuntu everything seems to have broken. No code changes except for the file location difference.
It really depends, if you‚Äôre going for something like static site that won‚Äôt change, build it yourself and get that experience in basic web dev. If it‚Äôs something like a blog that constantly needs changes the site might be best suited in a CMS since most of that heavy lifting has been done for you.
It‚Äôs more like for a business so I don‚Äôt need to change it periodically.
A web scraping apartment finder. My coworker turned me onto the idea, and now I really want to build one and release it into the world.
Wow you can do a moving animation with code?? How does that work? I can do a line chart but how do you keep it moving???
If you're new to coding one of the first things I would suggest is finding the python interpreter on your machine (the executable) which should open up a shell prompt. Type "hi"\*3 to get some output. Understand that the IDE such as Pycharm or Jupyter or IDLE is not the same as your session. Using a basic text editor save a .py file and run it without typing any instructions. &amp;#x200B; A great book to get started...

You can use two cron jobs. One triggered at boot and the other just repeats while the machine is up.
He made it out at the last second I think. Look closely at the bottom left corner at 0:07.
Scape the data save it to a database, then create a website to display that information, formatted to your choosing.
This should be a Raspberry Pi or Linux question, not an r/Python question. But anyway, you can use the autostart file in the xdg directory to autostart scripts. I would say it's the preferred way. https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2014/05/how-to-autostart-apps-in-rasbian-lxde-desktop/ Next best thing I would use is adding a cronjob task to run at boot.
What's this about? I don't get it. But congrats on finishing your project, it looks cool
Another option, much unappreciated, is [plumbum](https://plumbum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli.html#environment-variables).
Python isn't really ideal for web sites. Plus if you're new to programming then there's 100000000 things to consider security wise to keep the webserver from being hacked. If you're new then I would advise just using a third party application like Wix since that will be far more secure than something a new programmer can implement. There's exceptions of course and maybe you can make the site secure, but that's something I would consider seeing as web server security is a big deal and web sites are hacked for poor security every day.
its like zero G but not actually zero G
What I'd do as someone with no web experience: Step 1. write the scraper with the data you want, using Selenium or scrapy pr something. Step 2. properly format the data into an SQL database (e.g.) postgreSQL. Step 3. set up your website to consume the database.

It‚Äôs not just you - the systemd tutorials really suck. Big blocks of daemon config code, no explanation. ‚ÄúOh, it doesn‚Äôt work? Just RTFM, GLHF.‚Äù I don‚Äôt understand why this has to be so difficult. I gave up on it. cron is probably your friend here, as the other posts indicated. One point of clarification: If your script needs certain privileges, then that may not work. For instance - I had a script that ran some commands in response to keyboard input or GPIO input (from a few keyswitch buttons), and I found that running them via cron was not an option. Instead, I configured them to run automatically on a shell instance (via .bashrc) and then configured my RPi to autologin. That worked fine.

I first started with R and moved to Python. R is just so damn quirky and inconsistent. The thing about Python is it's basically unusable without Numpy which is a whole different metaphor with its own learning curve if your going to do it right. That said I'm sticking with Python, the language has a much better design. The reason to use either is their vast libraries for anything you can think of. If I had my druthers, I'd stick to C but that's not an option.
Thats cheating.

Maybe you could even use previously labelled images to train a model and have the computer decide for you. Xlwings might be a useful module for you too if you're doing it manually
This is what I'd do. Load up all the image urls into mem using this script I made two months ago. https://github.com/elibroftw/mp3-editor/blob/master/image_selector.pyw You should go through the excel sheet (in Python, use pandas or something) and if column b is empty, add the image url and it's row to a list/dict. Then supply my code with a list of image urls. This program is an image viewer. You should tinker with it so that there's 4 buttons and then bind them to keyboard bindings. Maybe you should also remove the image from the list once your done with it (to save memory) and have a loaf buffer of 5 images or something (since my program only reads the url when it's the image to be shown).
This is useful and well explained. Thanks! Also, saw how you spelled Portugal with the names.
I don't think you would like to see the code, because it's a disaster XD Also I made it just for use on my server so yeah
Are the images always something distinct categories - dogs, cats, cars etc? If so I would write a script to classify the image for you. There are lots of image libraries already out there today to provide training data. Here an example of classifying professions: [https://towardsdatascience.com/train-image-recognition-ai-with-5-lines-of-code-8ed0bdd8d9ba](https://towardsdatascience.com/train-image-recognition-ai-with-5-lines-of-code-8ed0bdd8d9ba)

Love his slide presentation, so clean
Someone pass the bleach please...
Why are you using curl for this and not making a request with Python directly?
How would I do that?
That pyenv uses its own installations of python is a feature, not a bug.
Try a dir(texture) to see what attributes and methods your texture object has.
I hadn't thought of that as of right now I figured out how to adjust brightness with the pi camera module but I know pillow is really good for editing and I have some ideas for implementing it like adding in an auto crop to the photos it takes but thank you for the idea I might try it out to see if I like the results better
Look into the Requests library.

Anything in particular that you would like to be reminded about? Maybe I can answer?
No sir, it's a massive review collection. I think it's the set of all reviews Yelp flagged as recommended. Tons of business on there by many different reviewers. [Yelp challenge](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge)
Thank you for the advice, I‚Äôll be sure to check out github! I‚Äôm attempting to analyze the time stamps on comments to determine the length of time between the most recent comment, and the one before it. There isn‚Äôt an automated report in QB that provides this information, so my thought was that I could attempt scraping the text.

Note: questions like this are better sent to /r/learnpython. That said, if you're calling external programs, you're almost always better off avoiding using shell=True, and should instead pass your arguments as a list. Involving the shell requires dealing with shell quoting (often requiring multiple levels of string escaping) etc and adds portability issues, so unless you really need it, it just complicates things. In any case, if doing this, inserting a name that's an argument is just a matter of providing it as one of the args. Eg: subprocess.call(["command", "--flag", NAME]) However, in your case, it's an embedded part of some data you want to send, so just do this by some form of string interpolation. You *could* do it the way you're doing with "+" (though you've messed up some of the quotes), but string interpolation is usually cleaner. Eg. with f-strings: data = f'{{"text":"Daily production RDS backup created named : {NAME}}}"' (The double "{{" indicates a literal "{", since "{foo}" is used for substituting variables. Or in older versions of python: data = '{"text":"Daily production RDS backup created named : %s}"' % (NAME,) Then call like: subprocess.call(["curl", "-X", "POST", "-H", 'Content-type: application/json', "--data", data, "https://hooks.slack.com/services/T0N#####/BL#########"]) But going even further, why delegate this to an external application at all when you could do it from within python code. Eg. Using the requests library, you could write this as: import requests response = requests.post("https://hooks.slack.com/services/T0N#####/BL#########", json={"text": f"Daily production RDS backup created named : {NAME}"})
I just started learning Python last week. I'm currently working my way through Automate the Boring Stuff in my free time both at work and at home. I work a kinda boring desk job where I don't feel all that challenged and I have a bunch of spare time. I mostly enter stuff into spreadsheets and send emails that are pre-rigged with signatures for the email content. I'm using the book to automate my job so I can have more free time to work on this text based adventure/puzzle game that I'm working on at home.
I am not quite sure about what you are trying to do Can you explain the wanted behavior of this function ?
Thank you. I am trying to divide a problem into small problems and solve each independently . I divide the inputs into pieces ( the list values) then pass each one alone to the function . The problem also, this function should share its output with others( other call) so that they can cooperate to reach a solution .
I'm glad you liked it. Ha. I did not even realize that. Duarte guest posted and put that in there. Very clever!
You mean trying to solve an equation ? Can you provide an example of the input/output that you are trying to have ?
Okay
CS degree is not mandatory if you have learnt a good deal on algorithms and data structures. (You should know roughly about list, array, stack, queue, tree and graph, their strengths and weaknesses, appropriate use for them). It also depends what area of development you want to work with Python. For web development you need less of algorithms and more of technical knowledge about the web (but you were frontend you should already know a good deal). &amp;#x200B; Yes you should code python projects, free or not. Bootcamps depends heavily on cursus/price/reputation, I'd be cautious. &amp;#x200B; Certification is less usefull than a good project in my opinion, and too costly most of the time. &amp;#x200B; Not a crazy idea, you got this!

This sounds like the perfect use case for [Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/).
touch√©.
Let me explain more : The list actually is many lists : (above I tried to simplify my question and I made it more difficult). V1=[[1,2,3],[1,4,5] ,[1,6,7],..] #all 3-length lists V2=[[1,4,2,3],[16,7,5],...] # all 4-lengths lists V3=[[7,6,5,4,5],.....] Number of Vn could be 4 ,5... . I want to pass this V lists to function f ( each call process one v , like the first call process v1(inputs of length 3) , the second call process v2(inputs of list 4) ... and so on ) . function f process each V then during this process the returned list of list won‚Äôt be from the same length, if first call with input v1 produced lists with lengths of v2 and v3 , those list should be exported to be processed by their own function call) That is : - each call should process one type of inputs , and the type is defined by the length of that input . - If during the execution of a specific f call another lists of different lengths (different than the call input) appeared, then these list should be processed by their call . That is why I need x shared, because inside the function f, lists get classified according to their lengths, and added to the dictionary x , where key is the list length and values are the lists: Example: Let us suppose we passed v1 to the function f X={}# x empty now X=f(v1,X) # only 3-lengths lists Now let us suppose, f returned this X : X={4:[[3,4,5,6],[5,7,4,6,],5:[[1,3,4,6,7],[2,4,6,7,1]]} Now these values , values of key 4 should be added to the input of the function call that processes type 4-lengths list input, Values of key 5: should be processed in the function call that process type 5-lengths lists . I don‚Äôt know if I made it easier or hard to understand now .
Always ask questions, its a good habit but you should be asking in /learnpython
You know what, this not a question , this a novel. I need to understand what I am doing and ask again. Thank you very much:)
I will try and respond more tonight but you don't even technically need an SDK. You can just do it with Requests and hit the regular API. However this means you will get everything returned as XML. I prefer a specific JavaScript SDK because it handles returning the data as JSON instead. You will need an app token(if the app requires them) and possibly also to login as a QuickBase user on that realm. https://help.quickbase.com/api-guide/understandreference.html You will probably want to use [DoQuery.](https://help.quickbase.com/api-guide/do_query.html) There may also be a more native solution that makes things easier that I can float your way but I just don't have time to write it out fully. It would involve form rules and 2 timestamp fields. You could take those fields and use a formula duration to get the time between them then just DoQuery for that field instead to see the duration between comments. Is the ultimate goal just to know the time between comments? To notify someone the record needs attention? I guess what I'm wondering is what are you going to do after you get the duration, so I can try and give you a better native solution.
um a=input("word to search: ") import webbrowser webbrowser.open_new(https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/",a) Is this what you meant?

Im not 100% sure what you mean but... If there's no REST API and what you're trying to do is to post directly to an website form make sure that you're posting to the correct url, i.e. the same url as in the [form action attribute](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_form_action.asp).

Why not just use LALR(1)? It's more than capable of parsing Python, and will probably do it faster than any other algorithm.
It provides a component system which offers a nice separation of application logic, data access, and request/response layers. One of the benefits of this is that packages built with Aioli can be moved around between instances, and even partly incorporated--using a Package's Service layer--into other API packages as extensions. &amp;#x200B; In short: Out of the box, Aioli provides structure, performance, portability, and high composability, while being easy to use. &amp;#x200B; Check out the Guestbook example, it's quite comprehensive: [https://github.com/aioli-framework/aioli-guestbook-example](https://github.com/aioli-framework/aioli-guestbook-example) &amp;#x200B; To further clarify: You could take the Service layer of the Guestbook example and *easily* incorporate it into your own Aioli API package, with database models and the whole shebang.
Well in python, mutating a list or dictionary effects all instances of the list. What do I mean by this? \`\`\`python a = {1: 'hello', 2: 'world'} def remove\_world(dictionary): a.pop(2) remove\_world(a) print(a\[2\]) # KeyError \`\`\`
In Java or C++, I would ask this question like; How to create many instances of a method ? Im new to Python , I cannot go back now to Jave or C since I am in the middle of my project .
Will do, thanks!
This looks awesome! Never seen something like this before!
This is cool! A related concept is [FigureFirst](https://github.com/FlyRanch/figurefirst), which allows you to build a figure layout as an SVG with inkscape (including whatever overlays, backgrounds etc. you want to add). Then you can use the template as a set of axes to plot on from matplotlib, and they get put straight into the SVG.
Actually [papermill](https://papermill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) allows you to call a jupyter notebook with parameters. You can use it for reports but there are certainly other uses.

I¬¥ve been working on an auto-clicker app and it¬¥s now finished &amp;#x200B; GitHub: [https://github.com/JaimermXD/auto-clicker](https://github.com/JaimermXD/auto-clicker)
It's a common oversight/misconfiguration in web apps. If you send a POST request to a URL that was intended to be used only for GET requests, you may get the same response as if you had sent a GET request, because the app author didn't bother to distinguish. I call it a misconfiguration because it's more informative to get a [405 Method Not Allowed](https://http.cat/405) for a POST to an unexpected URL.
I've been interested in building something like this as well. If you care to share, did you create a new scraper for each separate website you scrape? In general, how do you collect and aggregate the job postings?

I just uploaded a bot that I worked on last week to my cloud VM. It's a Twitter bot that, when its handle is mentioned in a tweet reply, it creates archived versions of the tweet and takes a screenshot. Works for creating proof of crimes or contradiction when people could just delete the original tweets if they said something "bad". Source at https://github.com/mauodias/arquivodetweets, it's very early alpha, feedbacks are more than welcome!
I created it this way because the conservation of energy equation where delta v is arbitrary 3d vector is complicated and underdetermined (one eq 3 variables). Assuming delta v purely in z direction collapses the equation into something solvable without any other assumptions (one eq one variable). I would like to add in friction and get some horizontal component to delta v eventually, but one step at a time.

Main script has several functions to cater for each source site. Scraped data is aggregated in CSV which is pushed into WordPress using the import plugin.
Backstory: I was interested in writing a GZIP file that acted as a quine, i.e. extraction will lead to an exact replica (the result of which can be found at: ``` blog.matthewbarber.io/downloads/quine.gz ``` (careful as it's basically a zip bomb, but modern browsers/OSs should be fine) I had a problem where I couldn't decompress the quine normally as I didn't know a CRC value that could be valid when it is contained in the original file and decompressions thereafter, ad infinitum. Hence, this script. It's checking through CRC32 values (over 4 billion permutations), but could be modified for anything. It takes a template file and you define where the "quoted" and "actual" CRC values need to be placed. Ran this through Google Cloud (they give free credit!) and it was found in like a few hours, kinda forgot. So yeah. Writing this in Python was great because it was easy to focus on the logic side of it... I'm probably speaking the choir here though ;\) (If bruteforcing is completely unnecessary and there's some smart math I could be using, then please shame me! For further explaination of what I was doing, I wrote about the process [here](https://blog.matthewbarber.io/2019/07/22/how-to-make-compressed-file-quines).)
Taking all the comments, it looks like you are trying to compute all possible permutations, and to memoize the results as you calculate them. Depending on your goals `from itertools import permutations` may be what you need. If your goal is to learn how to do this, then you want to read about memoization.
Thank you for the idea, I had not seen FigureFirst before. Seems also to be a very interesting concept. Although it seems a bit more effort to set it up compared to pylustrator. And in pylustrator you can remove the dependency to pylustrator after styling your plot. But if you are missing some features and advantages that FigureFirst has, maybe I can also implement a template system to pylustrator. I am always happy for new input.
Yes. That's a good way to think about it.
Well I did it once but I had a lot of subreddits to resubscribe

PySDL2 is a rather thin wrapper around SDL's C API. The `sdl2.ext` sub-package has a Pythonic interface to some functionality; but for the rest, you really have to refer to the C API docs and see what happens when you try to do the same thing from Python. Most of the time, replacing `SDL_Foo` with `sdl2.SDL_Foo` just works. When not, you need to bridge the gap using `ctypes`. This would be kind of scary if you didn't already know C, but take a look at the [tutarial](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/ctypes.html) and you'll see it's actually not that hard. Demo: &gt;&gt;&gt; surface = sdl2.sdlimage.IMG_Load(b'answer.png') &gt;&gt;&gt; surface.w, surface.h # oops! Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; AttributeError: 'LP_SDL_Surface' object has no attribute 'w' &gt;&gt;&gt; surface.contents.w, surface.contents.h (42, 42) &gt;&gt;&gt; window = sdl2.SDL_CreateWindow(b'hello texture', ... sdl2.SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED, ... sdl2.SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED, *size, ... sdl2.SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL) &gt;&gt;&gt; renderer = sdl2.SDL_CreateRenderer(window, -1, ... sdl2.SDL_RENDERER_ACCELERATED) &gt;&gt;&gt; texture = sdl2.SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface(renderer, surface) &gt;&gt;&gt; texture.w, texture.h # oops, i did it again! Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; AttributeError: 'LP_SDL_Texture' object has no attribute 'w' &gt;&gt;&gt; texture.contents.w, texture.contents.h Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; AttributeError: 'SDL_Texture' object has no attribute 'w' &gt;&gt;&gt; huh? File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1 huh? ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax Now what? Off to the C API docs we go. Turns out we need [SDL_QueryTexture](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_QueryTexture): &gt;&gt;&gt; w, h = ctypes.c_int(), ctypes.c_int() &gt;&gt;&gt; sdl2.SDL_QueryTexture(texture, None, None, ... ctypes.byref(w), ctypes.byref(h)) 0 &gt;&gt;&gt; w, h (c_int(42), c_int(42)) &gt;&gt;&gt; w.value, h.value (42, 42) N.B. all that is just to demonstrate how you'd use `ctypes` *if* you needed it. The sane solution is far simpler: &gt;&gt;&gt; surface = sdl2.ext.load_image(b'answer.png') &gt;&gt;&gt; surface.w, surface.h (42, 42) To get surface.pixels into OpenGL, you probably will need some `ctypes`, however. Using `SDL_Texture` is one way of going about that, but note that you're kind of rummaging through SDL's intestines at this point. You should reconsider whether you really want to use both OpenGL and SDL for drawing, and deeply integrate and intertwine the two like that. If you just want to draw into a surface and then shove those pixels into the GL, you don't actually need `SDL_Texture`. Instead, you could, for example, `ctypes.memmove` the `surface.pixels` into a Python `bytearray` and then hand that to `glTexImage2D` via PyOpenGL. (Don't forget about `SDL_LockSurface` and `SDL_FreeSurface`.) Furthermore, if you're after rendering text and GUI stuff, you'll find that SDL's drawing primitives are quite primitive indeed. You probably shouldn't bother with them *at all*. It's basically legacy stuff that was originally meant for fast software surface operations (blitting on the CPU etc.) and now, in SDL2, has hardware acceleration grafted on ‚Äî accompanied by extra complexity. I think that's fine for porting legacy PyGame code, but not worth the bother when you're already using OpenGL directly. Initialising an OpenGL texture from an SDL surface is useful when you're using `sdl2.sdlttf`. But for rendering nice 2D graphics, better look into libraries along the lines of PyCairo, Pillow, etc. Likewise for GUI stuff: have a look at Kivy etc. before starting to reinvent the wheel. Maybe I should clarify: I'm talking about these kinds of use case here: * Generate a texture once and then push it to the GPU. * Redraw a texture every once in a while and update the GL texture object with it. * Render an animation purely on the CPU and stream every frame to the GPU asynchronously, fire-and-forget style. I'm *not* talking about sharing pixel data between CPU and GPU and operating on it from both sides. That kind of approach doesn't play well with how OpenGL is meant to be used. A naive implementation is going to be expensive and slow, and doing it right, with double- or triple-buffering and just the right (i.e. minimal) amount of synchronisation, is a relatively advanced topic. So for now, just don't do it. While the GL is working on rendering the next frame, you already want to be busy sending it instructions for the frame after that, instead of waiting for `glGetTexImage` to return. That said, learning Python and OpenGL at the same time is already difficult enough; consider postponing the 2D drawing and GUI stuff for a bit and focusing on PyOpenGL. For someone familiar with Python, PyOpenGL is the absolute best way of learning OpenGL: You can copy all the interesting parts from textbooks and tutorials, even ones meant for C, C++, Java etc., and get them to work in Python with minimal effort. Instead of comparing all the return values to error codes, you just know that PyOpenGL does that for you and throws an exception with a nice traceback exactly where something went wrong, instead of just executing a couple hundred more lines until `SDL_GL_SwapWindow` ends up showing you some inexplicably glitchy mess or a mysteriously black window. A lot of other boring boilerplate can just be left out as well. So to a beginner who's having trouble with the kind of project you're doing, I'd recommend concentrating on just learning Python first, using [Pyglet](https://github.com/pyglet/pyglet), for example. But as you're already digging into GL directly and it seems to be going well, better skip that step. Because as nice as `pyglet.graphics` is, PyOpenGL is way friendlier than `pyglet.gl`. Way less need for `ctypes` shenanigans, for example. So, yeah, PyOpenGL all the way. There are higher-level abstractions that let you omit even more boilerplate, such as [Moderngl](https://github.com/moderngl/moderngl), but those are most useful once you're already comfortable with OpenGL ‚Äî they hide too much stuff you actually want to see when figuring out the basics. (Moderngl is really great, though, when you want to take a break from the OpenGL API and just focus on GLSL, e.g. by doing some [r/twotriangles type of stuff](https://www.iquilezles.org/www/index.htm). It's like Shadertoy ‚àí JavaScript + Python.) As an SDL user, I do recommend PySDL2 ‚Äî it's a bit rough getting started with, but still the best Python wrapper for SDL IMO. Correction: I'd recommend it for game dev. As long as you're mostly exploring graphics programming, feel free to take a break from it in case you hit another `ctypes`-shaped wall and get frustrated. You could have a look at [pyGLFW](https://pypi.org/project/glfw/) or [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/).
Try writing out the pseudocode of a battle and see where that gets you. You might actually be better off doing some sort of enum where all you need is attack type and pokemone type, with damage modifiers. Probably still a dict but instead of defining water, electric, etc, you would do a certain order and use 1 multiplier dict where you actually just compare the type and apply modifiers to a list instead.
If you look up Pokemon type charts, they're generally displayed in 2x2 matrix. What you're describing is essentially the same things, but using dicts instead of lists which means you can do the lookup with your pokemon types directly, instead of mapping indices to types. You're essentially making a graph, where your nodes are types and edges are the 'effectiveness' coefficients, so I wouldn't call that clunky :). If you have a large majority of mashups with the same value (e.g. 1.0 for the cases that aren't super-effictive/not-very-effective/ineffective), you optimize slightly by not storing those and having a default value, but you would probably need a lot of types for that to really matter.
I'm a brand new, 23 year old coder and I'm working on my first game using python's tkinter.
Can you provide some more details? What sort of information are you looking to find?
I'm upping for you blatantly not caring about getting banned by not using the scraping API, but if you can find pastebin pro on sale I'm sure you would enjoy it! And for some feedback: 1) Consider refactoring your code to separate any user-interaction logic (gui, asking the user for input, etc.) from the rest of your logic (scraping, parsing, storing things, etc.) Writing some small APIs for your business logic and having your user-interaction logic interact with those APIs will help you tremendously if you plan to scale your project. That will of course help organize the code and keep you sane as the codebase scales, but most importantly it will allow you to write very specific unit tests. Having worked a good bit with pastebin scrapers, trust me you want to integrate unit tests as early as possible. "Does this new code work? I dunno.. better wait 5-10 minutes until I can scrape a paste that will trigger the new code and then watch systemd logs for an error!" - me for longer than it should have been. Write some unit tests and don't let that be you. &amp;#x200B; 2) Have a look at PEP8, Google's python style guide, or some other guide to standardize your code. Flake8 ([https://github.com/nvie/vim-flake8](https://github.com/nvie/vim-flake8)) and the Pycharm PEP8 inspector are handy for this. &amp;#x200B; 3) For someone who uses your script often, going through all the menus could be tedious. A config file could help speed up that process for someone who already knows what they want.

On thing that might be helpful if you plan on changing these coefficients a lot would be to also have a dict for your mashup types (e.g. {'super_effective': 2.0, 'not_very_effectice': 0.5, ...}) and then store those keys in your mashup graph instead of the raw coefficients. That would give you a single place to modify these if you want to tweak them in the future. If you expect to keep them the same, or have a lot of special cases, it may not be as useful, though.

Thank you again for looking into this, I really appreciate you taking the time to respond. You‚Äôre correct, the goal is to determine how much time has lapsed since any action was taken so we can prioritize the queue based on what needs attention sooner than later. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt know if myself and other users have the accesses you‚Äôre referring to. I‚Äôll look into the resources you sent me after work today as well. I‚Äôm still fairly new to Python and haven‚Äôt had the chance to learn Java yet, I‚Äôm hoping that this will be a good learning experience.
I do plan on only storing super-effictive/not-very-effective/ineffective, with the default value being 1. A lot less typing that way haha.
Hey thanks for the suggestions. I‚Äôve actually already wrote a config system, but I‚Äôm waiting until I add the optional API support to push the update.
Sorry if it came across that way, but I absolutely wasn't intending to knock pylustrator! I think it'll be really attractive to a lot of people and certainly is more advanced than figurefirst. I just thought the people who would click on this post may also be interested in figurefirst, as it's a much lesser-known library than it ought to be.
You have ETL and EDA listed as top level things in your ReadMe, but I don't see an explicit definition anywhere... Extracting, Transforming, Loading? Exploratory Data Analysis?
We upgraded a backend API service from Python 2.7 to 3.6.8 last week. The project itself was straightforward enough ([thanks futurize!](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=python+futurize&amp;t=osx&amp;ia=web)) and we're already seeing massive benefits from it. The image is a screen cap of our New Relic app performance graph showing where the time spend in HTTP requests is spend. The purple part of the graph is time spent in database calls; that didn't change. The brown part is the time spend in the Python code in the API service, which dropped from about 200ms per call to about 50ms. If you need to convince your boss to let you invest in the upgrade, there you go: a real world example of someone making their service about 4x faster on the CPU (and about 70% faster for the end user). This means we can deploy many fewer API server instances while maintaining the same throughput, so we're directly saving money, too.
You can simplify to just: multi = typeChart['water'].get(attackType, 1)

Almost certainly a cultural trend towards "unique" names. It's a pretty recent thing that parents are concerned about there child being 1 of 4 Johns in the classroom. Plus we're exposed to much wider variety of names from other cultures and we've relaxed on a lot of the stigma around unusual/non-anlgo-traditional names.
nice work
The example I provided is just showing what the recommended "work around" is actually doing. It's not a case of "you should just do the same thing with different syntax", it's fundamentally doing something different because you are moving code from definition time to evaluation time. As for your example decorator, you can't actually do this, because [] doesn't mean "Create a new list" it means "Here's a new list (singular) that I have just created". And that's sort of the root of the problem. If you look at OPs get_time example you might get the difference. But try instead to consider something like foo(a=bar()+3): .... See the problem isn't that the result is mutable, and the recommended None check isn't just moving a value, it's actually moving the "place where the calculation and function call gets evaluated". What you could do instead is have something like: @fix_runtime_defaults def bar(a, b, l=lambda: [], k=lambda:bar()+3): ... But now you've also changed the interface so any place you want to then call it with a reference to an external list you need to do: my_list = [] bar(1,2,lambda: my_list) In order for the bar-body code to work out. But the decorator can take care of stripping off the lambdas so you don't need to do that manually in each function. But anyways, back to the example provided. The point is that what changes the results itsn't using the None check, it's the fact that you have moved the list creation from a singular point that's being passed on into a function, to a different location inside the body that gets called multiple times and returns a new (identity wise) empty list every time. As a side note, you're goal is not to "fix mutable defaults". Your goal is to do default assignment at run-time as opposed to at definition time. Mutable defaults have to be mutable, otherwise the language breaks. And you may very well have mutable defaults that you still want to assign at run time, or even just defaults that you want to get from non-pure like OP's get_time example. It's not mutability that is at fault here. The problem with "Mutable defaults" is that sometimes the users don't actually want mutable defaults, they just wrote mutable default initialization code in the definition time default assignment value, thinking it would run at runtime as oppose to definition time. You could as, "why can't I just make it treat the literal value after the equals sign as the body of a function and then move it into the recommended fix code?" And the answer here is simply that python isn't like Mathematica where everything is an expression and calling functions have access to the un-evaluated form of the argument expressions. when f(1+1) runs, it has no way of telling that originally the 2 it receives was a "1+1" and not just "2" or "3-1". Though technically a function can find this out by doing on the fly reparsing of the file it's coming from, finding it's on location in the AST and then working on that. Which is something I have toyed with on many occasions but is definitely not something you want to do for real, and it scales horribly and leads to exceptionally weird edge-cases and bugs. What you can however do is to create a decorator that creates deepcopies of all objects, so that if you have default mutable arguments a unique new copy of the mutable argument gets passed to each call to the function body: from copy import deepcopy from functools import wraps import inspect def deepcopy_default_args(fun): signature = inspect.signature(fun) @wraps(fun) def wrapped(*args, **kwargs): copied_defaults = { k: deepcopy(v.default) for k, v in signature.parameters.items() if k not in kwargs and v.default is not inspect.Parameter.empty } print(args, kwargs, copied_defaults) return fun(*args, **copied_defaults, **kwargs) return wrapped @deepcopy_default_args def bar(a=[]): a.append(1) print(a) bar() bar() This returns: [1] [1] As opposed to the normal out put of [1] [1] But again, this doesn't work for OPs get_time example because what he want's isn't the get new "mutable copies" for every call, he wants to actually move the run-location of the code he's providing to "calculate" the default value. In that case, this just gives you a new deepcopy of the get_time result from the original definition time call. And just to round off this matathon of a post in reply to your assertion number 2: &gt; The default value is evaluated inside the function body, so "any codebase that either uses the variable a or imports a dependency that uses the variable a" wouldn't be able to break anything. It would, because your hypotethical "desugaring" decorator would change: one=1 @do_stuff def bar(two=one+one): ... into: def bar(two=None): if l is None: l = one+one Which means this breaks: one=1 @do_stuff def bar(two=one+one): print(f'1+1 is {two}') bar() &gt;&gt; 1+1 is 2 one=2 bar() &gt;&gt; 1+1 is 4 The point being that if you just apply "syntactic sugar" to move the definition it's not actually syntactic sugar, it's rewriting the code to do something completely different. And while it should make sense to everyone that a functions body gets evaluated when you run it, it's not readily apparent that you should "guard" your default argument assignments because code later down the line might invalidate the assumptions you made about variables used in the default argument creation.

This is the answer.
Tough to say for sure without knowing the details of your data, but if you're trying to search for a single price value for a given ID, I'd probably start by merging left with file X to a new dataframe (don't overwrite your original). df_x = pd.merge(master, prices_x, how='left', on='ProductID') Then if df_x[price] is NaN, try merging your master list left to file y, and do the same check for the price column. You can repeat this until you find one. If you put your price files in a list or dict, it's pretty easy to loop through them and just break when you get a value from the price column for the ID. If you're trying to get prices for all of them and just output a full listing, you can merge all the files and then conditionally select the columns that aren't NaN. Not sure if it's the most efficient method, but it's how I'd go about it to start, anyway =)
Ok, thanks

Why is there such a big performance differential? Were performance improvements not backported because of time/money reasons, or are there more complex reasons?
- I can't tell what example you're referring to at the start, because you've written a lot of code and none of it seems to do what the recommended "default to None and None-check in the body" does. - I was thinking about rewriting the AST or bytecode too, which is why I used a decorator in my example. Creating a new function in that way seems like it would scale better than deepcopying the default args, because once you recreate the function, there's no runtime overhead (aside from evaluating the default argument expressions of course). However, all of this is irrelevant, because I noted in that same line of code that I picked some familiar syntax because I'd rather talk about the heart of the issue than bikeshed syntax about how you'd indicate that a default value should be re-evaluated each time the function is called. - I'm well aware that mutability is not the issue, and I never said that objects should be immutable by default. I named the decorator `fix_mutable_defaults` because the way this problem manifests the most often is "the gotcha with mutable default arguments." In my AST-rewriting prototype it's called `reevaluate_defaults`, because that's more true to what it actually does. - I understand what you mean now by other code changing a variable used in the default argument now. However, given that the point is to re-evaluate the default argument expression every time the function is called, that looks like working as intended. If you want `two`'s default to be a constant between calls, then don't use the decorator/other syntax that explicitly makes the default not constant between calls.
Yes I‚Äôve used a few times, it is very easy to use but limited in terms of the models you can choose from. I think Auto ML (another gcp product) does a better job in facilitating machine leaning for you. You basically point Auto ML toy our dataset in BigQuery and it does the rest for you. But besides all that easy of use. I still prefer to create and customize my models on the good old Jupyter notebooks.

Ah no, everything fine :-) I didn't took your post badly. Its just that I think maybe I can also learn some thing from FigureFirst to improve pylustrator. FigureFirst also seems a very interesting concept! And yes FigureFirst should be known more. If I had known it before, maybe I would not have had the need to develop pylustrator.

Uh likely best approach is to use a generator instead of a list... Although you won't be able to index on it or get it's length since it generates each item as you iterate through it. gen = {"".join(seq) for seq in it.product("01", repeat=30)} What are your trying to accomplish???
For such large quantity of objects you need to do some memory management. A trick I use is to create an object and implement _ _ slots _ _ as this will reduce the memory footprint of that object by approx 25%. So for example, s ="this is a string" class myString: _ _ slots _ _ ='value' def _ _ init _ _(self, value) : self. value = value ss = myString('this is another string") s will have a bigger size than ss. The difference is about 25%+. You could create your own objects or instead use generators as mentioned in a previous comment.

2.7 was marked as "complete" a long time ago, with only bug and security fixes still being applied to it. You have to upgrade to a current version to get the new features. As an example of the more complex reasons, consider that the new "await" keyword would break any existing code that used that word as a variable name. It would be very surprising if Python 2.x.(y+1) broke code that ran perfectly under Python 2.x.y, so adding that functionality _can't_ be 100% backward compatible.
So basically the delta v of "shit going down hitting the bottom and going up afterwards"?

Agreed, it really depends on the context. I would say far more beginners would use `type` when they should use `isinstance` rather than the other way around, just because that's what you usually learn first.
For anyone that hasn't, delving into the modules already in the standard library is really useful and fun: https://pymotw.com/3/

Do you know the people that maintain QuickBase for your company? They might be able to do this easily for you if you have a good use case and it sounds like you have one. I'm just trying to figure out what your level of access is because if you do not have access to change forms then you definitely don't have access to create an application token for yourself. You need that to do any of this unless those are turned off in the security settings. It's possible they are but unlikely.

I know the time is probably in seconds, but what are the units for energy? If I may ask.
I am finishing up my model-based organizer tool that manages audio &amp; video files for content-creators. You can specify many output directories and give each one attributes like filename search-terms and other features like audio normalization and silence stripping. The idea was to reduce overall redundancy and simplify large audio libraries when you have a bunch of one-shot sounds that are scattered over many directories. Before, much of this is done by hand and it can be very time consuming.
 I am finishing up a model-based organizer that manages audio/video files for you. You select an input and output directory, then specify unique folders and with properties like filename search-terms, convert to a specific file-format, enable audio normalization, silence stripping and more. The idea was to reduce overall redundancy and simplify large libraries when you have a bunch of media files that are scattered over many directories. Since there are no standard naming conventions for downloadable media, this is done by hand traditionally and it can be very time consuming. Audio Engineers and YouTubers will spend hours or days just trying to optimize their workflows, and this aim's to fix that automatically as it runs in the background tray.

This may be a stupid question, but how did you account for the energy loss after each bounce?
Post again when you upgrade from 3.6 to 3.8. *mind-blown.gif*
The Sim time is not even a second of real time. The values for energy are in units relative to one spacial unit (could be one cm, one meter, etc), so their absolute values are not as important as their values relative to each other. I could definitely adjust it so the sim time and real time are the same and get real values for energy. The graph would look the same though because the axes would change
I can‚Äôt wait to run that experiment. One of our third party deps doesn‚Äôt support 3.7+ yet (I forget which one, but it used a newly-reserved keyword). We didn‚Äôt want to change more than the absolute bare minimum in one pull request so that if things went south we could more easily isolate the break.
Units!!!
thank you. I appreciate it

This is a tutorial introduction to Python imports that I recently put up. It took me a while to come up with an outline structure that seems to work. Comments and especially errata are welcome.
Yes Ubuntu is great platform for programming you will learn a lot.
From python perspective : pandas, numpy, pyspark, parallelization (multiprocessing or something similar), classes and unit testing. Also learn how to write data to a database for the popular databases out there (sqlalchemy could be a starting point)
Thank you for your insightful answer, you have exceeded my expectations by far. Looking into SDL's drawing stuff some more I see that it is even more primitive than I had imagined; it seems all the useful stuff is hidden behind SDL\_Renderer/SDL\_Texture. The penny finally dropped on why I found nothing in SDL\_Texture, the pixels aren't even in main memory anyway. Reading them back just so I can load them into OpenGL is obviously not the way to go. PyOpenGL is indeed what I'm using for the OpenGL stuff and yes, I find it surprisingly easy to work with because as you say, documentation and example code is easy to come by. The ctypes stuff looks scary as hell but I finally got my SDL\_Surface pixels into OpenGL by taking a step back: `surface = sdl2.sdlimage.IMG_Load(fname.encode())` `surface = sdl2.SDL_ConvertSurfaceFormat(surface, sdl2.SDL_PIXELFORMAT_RGBA32, 0)` `gl.glTexImage2D(gl.GL_TEXTURE_2D,0,gl.GL_RGBA,surface.contents.w,surface.contents.h,0,gl.GL_RGBA,gl.GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, ctypes.c_void_p(surface.contents.pixels))` so now atleast sdlttf is within reach and I could load my images without PyGame. The texture appears upside/down so my vu coordinates were suddenly all wrong but that was easy to fix in the shaders. I'll have a look at PyQt5 to see if that makes things easier, thanks for the tip :-)
Can I get the sauce I mean source code?
&gt;As an example of the more complex reasons, consider that the new "await" keyword would break any existing code that used that word as a variable name.

Followed that sub. Thanks kindly!
Wow. We‚Äôre currently working on our python 3 upgrade and this is really exciting results!
This was very cool! Thanks for sharing
Also new to python. Do you recommend using something like PyCharm as opposed to using the normal python program downloaded from the python website?
better
I‚Äôm OP. üôÇ I was talking about reasons that changes aren‚Äôt backported to 2.7. The simplest reason is just that if you want new stuff, you have to upgrade. If everyone were backported, there wouldn‚Äôt be any reason to make newer versions. Alternatively, 3.8 is just the version of 2.7 that has all the cool new stuff added to it.
YMMV, of course! But I was surprised and thrilled to see these results. We ported for other reasons, but the fact that it made our existing code run better was icing on the cake.
I love PyCharm and have a personal license (no longer paying annual license). That being said, I don't use it any more because I've begun to use VScode for pretty much everything. It also has great python support and overall is great for many other things besides python. Which, you will likely be programing in more than one language for most projects. I still love PyCharm and in the end the it offers a great suite of tools. VScode is free and also has a great set of tools and is also very customizable. As someone that is new to python, I say check out the PyCharm community edition if you're familiar with something like eclipse already. The package manager is still great and makes managing environments pretty easy and your not wading through the command line as much. If this is for a professional setting, I would say learn how to manage your python environment yourself. The day you have to use a cluster environment or you have work place restrictions (e.g. security) you will appreciate knowing your way around the python ecosystem and working without an IDE.
Nice one friend, can i ask which package that you use. I am planning to build some data structure and algorithm visualization for my students in university. But i don't know which package there are suitable.
Side note, I tried to challenge myself to do this the ‚Äúhard‚Äù way (I wasn‚Äôt previously aware of the ‚Äúrange‚Äù function thingy) and I finally came up with a while loop to solve this based on what I know so far. I have no one to share this small (but huge) victory with, so I hope this impresses you. list1 = [1] while list1[-1] &lt; 1001: list1.append(list1[-1] + 1) It **worked**. I am ECSTATIC. I feel like I just wrote the backend code for a nasa vessel destined for the nearest star system. Thank you. Have a fantastic night.
Splendid ! Throw that code in my inbox :))
You could start by reading the sidebar.
For Python the semantic version is effectively xy.z. Only .z releases are fully backward compatible. They also don't formally use semver in anyway.
It only took them like forever to go offline only, but it finally happend. I also really like the inclusion of plotly express. Finally a more seaborn like API for plotly! With the addition of easy creation of animated graphs, I will play around with it a lot in the near future.
awesome work! I've been waiting for something like this for ages. Especially that the "formatting code" is inserted into the code itself afterwards is a killer feature. However, I feel the interface and all is still a little bit clunky to work with, but I hope you keep up the good work and polish it over time :) I'll make sure to cite you in my next paper. Also: when you have more than one plt.show() in your code, usually I go through them by just closing one window and the next one shows up automatically right afterwards. However, with Pylustrator every single plot gets reopened again everytime a new one is supposed to show up. Maybe you can look into that as well!
Honestly looks really realistic now! Does appear a bit slowmo, is that deliberate? Or maybe one of your constants is a bit off like g or the mass of the phone ü§î
I don't know about stock. Probably the stock exchanger website will give you access to those data in a certaint interval (daily). Cryptocoins are decentralised. Each broker is a different market and they usually offer its own api. I use and recommend CEX.IO through Restful api.

Ah ok, well I did not had this use case before, but matplotlib offers a lot of different possibilites to use the plotting. I will have a look at your issue. I am happy that you like the software :-)

What other ways of parallelisation are there? (other than multiprocessing)
ü§îwhat are the advantages LALR(1) have over PEG ?
Did you need to make it elastic so it loses energy?
Eh, there's no perfect way to set up a Python environment. I think your setup is good enough. Having used all of the things (pyenv, pipenv, anaconda, virtualenv, virtualenvwrapper, docker, etc) what I now tend to do is this... 1. brew install python (this installs python 3) 2. manage virtualenvs with the built-in `venv` module i.e. `python3 -m venv venv_dir` 3. if I have need of another specific Python version, I use the GUI installers from the website https://www.python.org/downloads/ and choose not to have it edit my `$PATH` on installation (I use [xonsh](https://xon.sh/index.html) for my shell) 4. I use [poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/) to handle my projects' dependencies I'm not saying my setup will be right for you and your team; those are just the tools/habits I've settled on at this point in time having worked in Python-land for a while.
That's not the whole story. PEG parsers tend to use a LOT of memory, while LALR probably has the smallest footprint possible for LR(1) grammars.

I understand your question. People usually ask this when they take integration as reinventing the wheel. It is not. if a web site owner wants to show some job listings on their site and the source does not provide API / widget or some other auto content fetching system then we have to scrape the source and import it into the destination.
Short of having everyone do their developing inside a container, what you‚Äôve got there seems pretty much the minimum. Could be scripted, of course... seems the only variables are the user‚Äôs shell choice and the project repo URL.

Is it possible to handwrite LALR easily or is it equally developer productive? What do you think of this? ü§î &amp;#x200B; PEG can be easier to implement. Some of my old code: PEG: [https://github.com/JaDogg/\_\_py\_playground/blob/master/peggy/peggy.py](https://github.com/JaDogg/__py_playground/blob/master/peggy/peggy.py) Calculator: [https://github.com/JaDogg/\_\_py\_playground/blob/master/peggy\_test/calculator.py](https://github.com/JaDogg/__py_playground/blob/master/peggy_test/calculator.py)
Is it possible to manually write a LALR(1) parse-table? Probably, but I wouldn't suggest it. But why would you want to? Just describe a grammar, and let a generator build it for you. Implementing LALR(1) isn't very hard. It can be done in about 300 LOC (Python code). And if you don't allow empty-productions, it can be even less. How do you measure "productive"?
CCXT for crypto
It's not really a Python answer (although the tool is written in Python) but [unoconv](https://github.com/unoconv/unoconv) will probably do what you want.
I already looked into this but I don't see docx in the supported formats list? [http://dag.wiee.rs/home-made/unoconv/](http://dag.wiee.rs/home-made/unoconv/)
Indeed, I don't either but I understand that it uses libreoffice to do the actual conversion and since *that* supports docx I would think it's worth a go.
Ok this indeed looks by far the simplest, will give it a go, thanks!
Recompile vim with the version of your python
If you have brew (so your are on mac), you can ease my installation process by removing * Use it as global: pyenv global 3.7.2 * Install [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv): pip install --user pipenv And do instead * brew install pipenv
I'm wondering if this step: pyenv global 3.7.2 is required. Can I use the system python to install pipenv and then use pyenv only for local project.
joblib for example, futures also support pll
This is not exactly a Python solution but exactly what AppleScript is made for on the Mac. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs gonna be a very simple solution to your problem that doesn‚Äôt require any third-party utilities (other than Word).
Use the multiprocessing module? Should be fairly straight forward, it's explained in the official docs and sentdex has videos on how to use it
Should work, though I‚Äôd be a little wary of the system python being 2.x ... IIRC pipenv should work identically on either, but I‚Äôve never tested that fact.
This might be a typical use case for papermill. https://old.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/cgcm3e/automated_report_generation_with_papermill_part_1/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link
That doesn‚Äôt answer to me why it‚Äôs faster. That‚Äôs just is the new is better argument, which is not always true since new features means code bloat. Python 3 is slower on startup because namedtuples are slow. I know they‚Äôre working on that, but again newer isn‚Äôt always faster. There is one or more specific changes to python that made your code fast. Is your code unicode heavy, math heavy, etc.?

Makes sense. Good discussion. I personally don't like code generators as they tend be hard to change at a later time. ü§îBut then again most of the parser libraries generate some code at some point.

It's not perfect, tables are different size, images are in wrong positions, also found and tried choco install pandoc miktex pandoc --pdf-engine=pdflatex asd.docx -o asd.pdf but the results we pretty much the same, the structure of the file was not preserved :\\
LibreOffice has a Python API afaik. You can probably do something with that
Yo Nats, try this out: https://github.com/modin-project/modin The API should be fine for what you've already done in Pandas - let me know if you see any speed up from it.
Note that generating a parse-table doesn't mean generating code. It's usually how it's done, because generating code can give you the best performance, but it's not a necessity of the algorithm.
Of course :)
Nice compilation.
Have you tried simply opening the file in LibreOffice directly. Does it read it ok with the correct layout?

Pretty vague/generic job req. But if its SAP give yourself an overview of SAP product lineup that you'll likely be working with or can at least talk to them in an interview. At least read up on these 2: * SAP ECC (their OLTP application that handles processes like ordering through billing, finance, HR, warehouse mgt etc). * HANA - their in memory database - I believe they now have it where you can use python and leverage the HANA server's memory but my work instance doesn't have that yet.

Nope, neither does it look right in google docs, I guess I'll have to live with it and hope client won't use funky formatting. I decided to go with pandoc + latex because it's one line install on both Windows&amp;Mac and works the same on both.
Sorry for the delay. Through nanoparticle tracking we are aiming at medical research and diagnostics, however there could be other interesting industries such as catalysts for petro-chemical, bubble formation, basic research in academia, pharma (thinking cosmetics), etc.
Why scrape, would an api not be better for this? worldtradingdata.com for example. Although the free service has limits. 200 queries/day (max 5 symbols/query)
isn't colab awesome?!
I don't know if client has Office suite installed or even purchased. I wouldn't like to make my app dependant on software that's not easily available.
Not stupid at all. Does the simulation account for air resistance? Damping? Some kind of work done by damage?
LibreOffice won't ever work, because it handles tables differently. I think it converts them into frames or something when you import a docx into LibreOffice, so that'll cause all kinds of problems. It does support docx, but there are just a lot of issues.
One thing in particular is that the dict class got a lot of face lifts and improvements, and it's an important foundational piece for a lot of the rest of the language. It's just something they didn't backport. Check this out: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npw4s1QTmPg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npw4s1QTmPg)
From the energy graph, it seems like energy is only lost on impact, so I assume air resistance/damping is ignored. I would be really interested in knowing how he modeled the energy loss from the impact. I suppose it mainly has to do with the toughness of the material he selected but I have never personally modeled something like this so I‚Äôm really curious
I know it doesn't sound very intelligent,but How did you make it? I know you used python,and??
Pygraphvis looks promising, I played with graphviz
That's interesting, I don't remember there not being much performance work in the Python 3 branch except for scheduler things, and the not-necessarily-performance-related-but-might-have-impact string representation (3.3 I think) and dict representation (3.6). [Old benchmarks by the core team were mostly a wash](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/speed/2016-November/000472.html) though with up to 50% gain or loss on specific benches. I don't remember significant performance changes (positive or negative) at $dayjob. So I'd say you were "lucky" and either hitting some sort of issue in P2 which was fixed in P3, or got outsized benefits from some P3 changes.
Great! Very Cool Programmer!
Thanks ,that's one I looked at, not quite what I need I don't think, it's for a chose your own adventure style thing, so more like a decision tree but with more than 2 choices y'know?
Sure sure, just thought it may be interesting to note. Numpy is hyper-optimized so in a different context where perhaps you're doing a lot of these operations, it may make a large performance difference. Especially if you were working in a high-dimensional vector space.
personally I would do this: get what i'm assuming is your different files into different dataframes df1 = pd.read_csv(mainfileofproducts.csv) df2 = pd.read_csv(mainprices.csv) df3 = pd.read_csv(secondaryprices.csv) df4 = pd.read_csv(lastresortprices.csv) build a function to do whatever logic you want def functiontomatch(prodid): if len(df2[(df2['productid'] == prodid)]) &gt; 0: return df2.loc[(df2['productid'] == prodid), 'price'].values[0] elif len(df3[(df2['productid'] == prodid)]) &gt; 0: return df3.loc[(df3['productid'] == prodid), 'price'].values[0] else: #Assuming df4 has all productid's etcetc return df4.loc[(df4['productid'] == prodid), 'price'].values[0] Then like you said iterate through, but don't do a crass iterate use a funky apply df1['price'] = df1.apply(lambda row: functiontomatch(row['productid']), axis=1) This will leave you with your df1 having the price you want, I assume you have enough knowledge to bend this to what you want i to be
Is the simulation python too? You say you used numpy for the math, is that it, or are you using a numerical integrator from scipy?

You may notice I didn't do any error handling--since this started out as my own personal script I didn't intend on writing any, but I may do it at some point.
Not even word. Pages, which comes free on every Mac, can open both .doc and .docx.
On openSUSE you need to install \`python3-tk\` package.
It‚Äôs very object heavy (slinging around a lot of ORM instances), and I‚Äôm guessing that the dict optimizations help an awful lot.

Nice! Now can you please make it such that the kinetic energy increases by a small percentage after each bounce? That would look epic ;)
Thats my problem, I don't know how to use python in pycharm or sublime text etc etc
Python doesn‚Äôt follow semantic versioning.
Backwards compatible, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you can always go to an older release and expect things to work assuming you don‚Äôt hit a bug. Python 2.7.14 is very different from 2.7.0. The struct module got upgraded to support unicode as an input, which made supporting python 2.6 much harder. That was an issue for me for years.
I don't know of any API, but you could probably just scrape marketwatch.com to get real-time data.
Creating a django web-app for ERP mass-edit and reporting services writing a script to expand vehicle application data to all like-parts. so essentially creating the same fitment data as part A1, for parts A2-A16. Searching for certain indicators in part A1 like description keywords, field flags, etc to determine the data needs to be copied.
Yeah, that would be my guess. Dicts are everywhere in python.
Thank you for sharing

Any method within a unittest.TestCase class with "test" as part of its name is detected as an executable test and so its run. I'm assuming the order might be alphabetical.
Wading through literally\* thousands of full precision FITs/images of New Horizons encounter with Pluto, and then bringing that into a (hopefully) beautiful visualization. Working this datasets in full precision/data is amazing, since press releases often focus on select images and sometimes (many times?) there are hidden surprises to be found. &amp;#x200B; \*they're exactly 6812
I am going through the same process now. I figured for my scripts to run on another machine, I need to replicate the environment, if I can't, what's the point of investing time developing scripts anyways.
thank you üòÅ
I think https://alpaca.markets/ could have what you're looking for.
Nothing because I can't find any beginner project ideas.
I‚Äôve been working on a service to send customized news bulletin emails - like the New York Times daily briefing, but totally personalized. You can add custom alerts for keywords, choose when you get emails sent to you, pick what news sources you want included, and so on. Still working through some things, but it‚Äôs getting close. Feel free to check it out if you‚Äôre curious - would love any thoughts! www.quotanews.com
Data is generally not free (or even cheap). Try [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) (free). You can also use Quantopian, but I think they own your algorithms.

My pain... I‚Äôm a noob learning python. So far I‚Äôve learned my mathematics skills are weak
it's so interesting!! anw do you use spyder or jupyter? or other IDE?
CodeRunner
This is practically the most complicated though process I have seen in this regard :) So just another way to do this with your knowledge. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; l = \[\] x = 1 while (x &lt; 1001): l.append(x) x += 1 &amp;#x200B; It is basically the same thing just a little bit easier to read (so you dont have to use the -1 index)
create a contacts book through command line scrape some data from IMDB and present it
Yeah, it‚Äôs in prod so I can‚Äôt easily benchmark it against real traffic. When I get in to the office, though, maybe I can test running the unit and integration test suites in 3.6 and then again in 3.5 (and 2.7 for giggles) to compare at least those numbers.
A hierarchical accomplishments tracker, so I can show my boss (and myself) what I got done this year, come performance review time.
