What problem do you need to solve
Try using codecademy python course. Its free and one of the best to cover the basics

I personally used Flask with socket.io and it's fast enough for few users. I don't know if it would scale nicely higher if we are talking thousands of users - you'd definitely need to change server and write whole app with such usage in mind. Nonetheless quickness in Flask and sockets seems to be really nice - you're not writing a fps game with it, right?
Just in the flavor of teaching... Here's what the comprehension would look like. import random def foo(): sentence = input('sentence: ') return ''.join( c.upper() if random.randint(0,1) else c.lower() for c in sentence )
It's part of the function declaration.
Thousands.....if == to naked girls
Yea, it was easier than I thought it would be. The only pain point was with various functions/modules that used to take/return strings - I had to spend some time converting params to/from bytes. Not a huge deal.
If he wasn't happy about it, why did you oblige him and why are you posting it?
This looks like a before and after human growth hormone pic seriously thats the same teeth nose chin and hair texture is this your dad?
Unfortunately it doesn't work nicely with the tables I need to extract, but for PDFs where the tables are easily identified it's an awesome package
This is awesome.
No I have no clue on this. Will have to try this one to see what it offers. Also will this approach allow me to use async await feature of python?
This isn't a knock against the library the author is advertising, but scientific computing in python tends to be very object oriented and involves passing around lots of classes that probably have insufficiently detailed __str__ or __repr__ functions for this sort of thing to be of all that much value. This approach also requires that your entire library(s) be littered with the decorator, and scientific computing tends to be pretty anti dependency.
The (s) is a parameter for the function sarcasm, doesn’t do anything itself but will just take the value of what will be passed into the function afterward. Like if you do `sarcasm("What does the S do")`. The function will treat the string as S, do its thing and return something like `WHaT doEs ThE s dO`.
Exactly!!! Windows is a pain to develop on but VScode ha definitely made it a little easier.
Is there some greater meaning or message that he’s trying to impart?
u/K900_ is right! Profiling your code should come first before thinking of anything that's too "extravagant" like using async. You will be able to find the bottleneck by profiling.
I'd throw in some logic so you never get a run of more than two characters in the same case, otherwise users are bound to get SHOUTING just by chance every now and then. Just keep the last two characters' case in variables, and if both are the same case then skip the randomization and manually choose the next character's case.
The joy of Python is that shorter is more often better than in other languages. See the comprehension someone posted here. Miles more readable.

I can't speak for python, I built metric dashboard using R, markdown and plotly.
If only it was pep8 compliant
Since source is not released, I'm guessing it is a commercial product that you are paying for, at that point I would pressure them to do their goddamn job. Python 2.7 was created over 10 years ago (that's also the time Python 3 appeared, Python 2.7 was essentially backporting Python 3 features, which is part of the reason why migration took so long) it is in maintenance mode (no new features, only security fixes) since 2015 and in few months its support will be completed dropped.
Bypasses metered connection and updates it
If you are Guido at pycon, you should just suck up your introvertedness for two days and appreciate that people love the tools you developed.
Your dads cool with you referring to him by his first name?
If you're thinking about static graphs, you can always produce the insights using jupyter notebook, and them export it to a pdf file. You can also export to a html file, which may support interactive graphs (though I'm not sure about that). Notebooks support markdown, so you can write pretty text as well.
Got that bash script hosted anywhere, seems like a nice little setup. Bonus points if you build it in a docker container
I actually have to code remotely for many reasons. I've been using vscode the wrong way lol
How could he get mad at his own son? 😂
You're onto the right track, but should use XOR (`^`) to randomly flip the uppercase bit of only letter chars, so FTFY..... maybe: import random def sarcasm(s): return ''.join(chr(c ^ random.choice([0, 0x20 * (0 &lt; c &amp; 0x1f &lt;= 26)])) for c in map(ord,s)) Guaranteed tested for off-by-one errors.
Did the installation of `pip` fail or did the installation of a pandas dependency that was being installed using pip fail? What are you trying to install and what was your code. Give us more info, man. Might be a python version issue as well, so... what version of python?
What part do you need help with?
As the rules state, this should be asked in /r/learnpython, and as their rules state, homework help is allowed as long as you can show you've made an attempt
It is. The black format is a strict subset of pep8.
You should post questions like this in /r/learnpython. Since this looks like an assignment you should show some attempt at coding it. If you can't start coding we can help with understanding how to start. In /r/learnpython.
Got it thanks
You should look at the [learning resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index#wiki_new_to_programming.3F) in /r/learnpython.
Yes, PSSE is developed by Siemens, and is the primary simulation tool used by major utilities around the world. Cost is around $3500/month. Given the monster that they are, my best bet is to try to work around what we have . I'm thinking that the solution may involve writing the application in Python 3, and invoking Python 2.7 when needed just to communicate with PSSE. PSSE is just a part of a larger application that I envision expanding into a dashboard that interfaces our database, PSSE, and other simulation tools. Is there a way that certain functions are executed in a specific version of Python? For example, to solve the case in PSSE you would say: psspy.fnsl([1,1,0,1,0,0,99,0]) Would I be able to put this in a method that is in a class stored in a different file, which executes in Python 2?
I love the black project, but it's pretty surprising that it came under the psf so quickly.
Why is the async version only 3 times faster? What would need to be done to the code to make it run 10x faster? Surely a web server can handle 100 concurrent connections.
Check out this strategy that uses Cythonize to convert Python 2.7 to C and uses that from Python 3, it looks pretty neat: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/bjw5v3/comment/emcfidd

It could be he was late to get somewhere. At PyCascades I was able to have some really good, extended conversations with Mike Kennedy and Dan Bader, but it was in the snack/relax room, and they were clearly milling about. I'm sure someone might get their nose bent out of joint if Mr Rogers couldn't make time to talk, if given the wrong circumstances. Plus OP probably said walrus operators are cancer.
You can set the line length with a command-line parameter.
PDF files arent enough for what I'm looking for, unluckily. Imagine plot.ly graphs, which are interactive, and some tables &amp; filters.

Possibly Flask + fancy plotting library (that I'm not aware of?)
Indeed I set mine to 100 :)
Bro is that your fucking dad you guys are identical
We need to start a movement to rename "walrus operators" to ["fry guys"](http://www.showbizpizza.com/events/10th/rap/mcdonaldland/images/character_fryguys.png).
Oh no, there's a That Kid in the class.
Dash (by plotly) was made for exactly this usecase. https://plot.ly/products/dash/
Cookie cutter is the main tool I've used in the past.

The distinction I like to make is Computer Science versus Software Engineering. In my mind, computer *science* proper is the academic study of computer science, e.g., doing research, writing academic cs papers, finding new algorithms and data structures, analyzing runtime complexity, mathematical proofs of algorithms. Topics generally independent of particular programming languages and APIs. Computer programming people and software engineers certainly apply results and techniques from computer science, and should have a good working understanding of computer science in the same way that chemical engineers should have a working understanding of chemistry and mechanical and electrical engineers should have good working understandings of their respective branches of physics. I am definitely not putting down software developers. Engineers and devs are the people that make things happen in the world and produce things of value to society. And there is some overlap with computer science, to be sure. I'm just saying that Computer science can be an academic subject and a branch or math/science.
Do you get appointed as a wizard by someone if you write a program language, it becomes a contender for most popular language in the world, and a gaggle or misfits hold conventions the world over in your honor?
Well that was wrong, im actually learning about requests and api, its very easy though.
It’s Guido’s secret love child. No wonder he balked on the photo evidence.
That's the general idea
Afaik scrappy is the goto for that
We used to get their autographs but no one knows how to write anymore so times have changed. Also, selfies won't end up for sale on eBay.
Yes but they aren’t in the field format we need. This is 100 lines of code, no muss, no fuss.
This is my personal recommendation, others may have different opinions. For beginners, start with BeautifulSoup. Once you have a good foundation of how to scrape a website, the next step is to maybe looking into scrapy (a much more complex framework but with much more powerful and robust features and functionalities) to create a bot to automate web scrapping tasks. Selenium is optional, but it is something nice to learn as the API will help you to get deeper understanding how browsers work.
There is this "Visual Basic To Python Converter": http://vb2py.sourceforge.net/screen_apps.htm that may help you if you have on a small amount to convert. Myself (and probably most other python folk) would probably say that you should be thinking in terms of re-writing your code in Python. This is especially true if you are looking for maintainability , efficiency, etc. These are pretty different languages and best practices in one are not the same as the other.

Apologies for the delayed response! Was busy launching [linux support](https://kite.com/blog/kite-adds-linux-support-opens-line-of-code-completions-to-more-python-devs) for Kite. &amp;#x200B; We hear all who’ve given us critical feedback as covered in the article. We agree it was a mistake, and over the 18 months since we’ve listened to the community, hence releasing “cloudless” for Kite in January so that no code syncs to a server (see details here: [https://kite.com/blog/launching-line-of-code-completions-going-cloudless-and-17-million-in-funding](https://kite.com/blog/launching-line-of-code-completions-going-cloudless-and-17-million-in-funding)).
Your code never leaves your computer: [https://kite.com/blog/launching-line-of-code-completions-going-cloudless-and-17-million-in-funding](https://kite.com/blog/launching-line-of-code-completions-going-cloudless-and-17-million-in-funding)
No copy, Kite can't even see your code. We ship pre-trained ML models to your computer and all processing is done locally: [https://kite.com/blog/launching-line-of-code-completions-going-cloudless-and-17-million-in-funding](https://kite.com/blog/launching-line-of-code-completions-going-cloudless-and-17-million-in-funding)
&gt; What does the "(s)" do? An easier way to put it is this def fruitType(type) print(f'you chose {type}') fruitType('Apples') # Output: # you chose Apples Whatever you set when declaring the definition between the first parentheses automatically makes a new variable that you can use inside of that definition. The value set for 'type' above is passed through on fruitType('Apples') where 'Apples' is inside the variable 'type' Same thing occurred in their code, only instead of typing out a whole word, they chose to use a single letter. They could have typed def sarcasm(sarcasmtext):, and down below 'for c in sarcasmtext', and got the same result. You can also do this and get the same output as the example above def fruitType(type) return f'you chose {type}' print(fruitType('Apples')) # Output: # you chose Apples where returning it only passes through the value to the function being called, but doesn't print it. So if it was like a math equation, you could do newNumber(num) + 5, or store it into a list and etc without having it print anything.
I do everything in the workflow I'm comfortable with. - I do use pipenv but with the --skip-lock flag 😈. But most platforms don't understand Pipfile so I also write a requirements.txt. - Works most of the time using TDD so I am not skipping pytest, pytest-cov and pytest-html. - PyCharm as an IDE saves a lot of time for refactoring, linting and other things - Uses git and GitHub - To test on other platforms, I use Travis CI (Linux) and Appveyor (Windows) and codecov to get the final code coverage report. - Did I mention that I release libraries from Travis CI to PyPi after tests passed? You can write a bash script but you cannot automate everything. The services I mentioned speeds things up. Cookie cutters are really nice but I want my main Python installation clean. What is important is "Time to Production".
Thank you for your help..:-)

Second in here!
[https://www.reddit.com/r/applescript/comments/bk4ym7/autisticspambot/](https://www.reddit.com/r/applescript/comments/bk4ym7/autisticspambot/) i made an automation out of this idea, for mac only thanks for such great inspiration
if you would use future obj you can determine state [https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-future.html#asyncio.Future](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-future.html#asyncio.Future)
To quote a pirate movie: "the code is more what you'd call "**guidelines**" than actual rules." &amp;#x200B; Also pep8 states: "Some teams strongly prefer a longer line length. For code maintained exclusively or primarily by a team that can reach agreement on this issue, it is okay to increase the line length limit up to 99 characters, provided that comments and docstrings are still wrapped at 72 characters." &amp;#x200B; So black's 88 is a good compromise
Oh nice, I have just the use for this: my shoddy command line utility that reformats some text ready for pasting into some software. No more drag selecting from console for me!
because it is not truly concurrent. python under the mask run tasks in the loop and when io sleep appears (in this case waiting for response) it's switches context (it's switches to the next item in list). &amp;#x200B; It's works similar if I you would have one core processor without ht and run multiple processes 'at once'. System scheduler very quickly switch between processes, changing context
If you are looking for work life balance you are coming to the wrong place.
I get what you are saying, but I’m looking for a mentor, not work life balance on Reddit. That was just something I mentioned as one of the reasons I’m not happy with my job.
My point is that most programmers / coders lack this work/life balance that you seek. It is not uncommon to spend many hours into the night writing and or debugging code.
Like I said, I totally understand what you are saying here. But I’m not here looking for a “better work like balance” nor am I here looking for a “mentor to help my work life balance”. Just looking for a mentor. BUT since work/life balance was the only thing you read from my post, I’ll elaborate on that just a bit. I’m not miserable with my job because I spend countless hours at night coding. In fact I don’t think that’s terrible. The problem is that we’re understaffed and over worked and I don’t agree with the compensation. So, you see, my issue of work/life balance is the product of many factors including a one I did not mention. Not endless hours of coding throughout the night. But I do appreciate your response please don’t take this the wrong way
If you're looking for book-like introductory resources I maintain a [list of free Python books](https://github.com/pamoroso/free-python-books), including introductory ones. You may check these books and pick the ones you like.
Thanks so much
My more readable you got tetris in there...: Hahaha good job though
...also mentioning that he wasn't happy about it.
There are a couple of ways to approach your objective. This first is the most obvious and that's to pay for a mentor via pursuing a degree in CS or Software Engineering, the second is a coding bootcamp, then there is also there is the self study / self taught route via either using free online tutorials, free online college courses, or purchasing books. I think that you would be hard pressed to find someone willing to invest time (mentor) in someone that they randomly met via the internet and that they are not personally vested in, in some manner. It would be easier to find someone in your current company that might be willing to allow you to shadow them or bounce ideas off of them based upon your self study. These options would be my suggestion. But hey I could be wrong. Good luck on your pursuit no matter which option you choose to pursue.

I know right? Total disrespect and flagrant disregard for something that clearly makes the guy uncomfortable.
I've met Guido at europython few years back. He just dropped in as he was nearby so of course he loves the community and celebrates python with us. He did take few pictures with us and had a short chat though he really didn't understand our business but he still was polite untill someone else came in and asked him about GIL. People were killing this guy with their eyes but he just wouldn't let go lol. I don't blame him if he's avoiding public, I couldn't be as half as polite and chill as he was when confronted by anti social nerds lol. Unfortunately I have the lost the picture I've had with him but it was a memorable event nevertheless.
import guido as dad
glad to hear it! enjoy
Oh , no offence at all man you're giving me really helpful advice. So I don't think I can have a masters in math at an age of 17. What can I do ? Or is the whole idea of doing machine learning freelance a bad idea if I don't have some masters or phd. I currently know very well how to use feed forward deep learning neural networks on datasets , I am currently learning about convolutional neural networks , and I will probably learn about LSTMs and recurrent neural networks after that.
Shoot I've dropped support for Python 3.5 as have many open source packages. 3.4 really?
Thanks for all the advice sir. So what should I do to have a compelling argument ? I currently know very well how to use feed forward deep learning neural networks on datasets , I am currently learning about convolutional neural networks , and I will probably learn about LSTMs and recurrent neural networks after that.
&gt;le, which is the Python bytecode file, compiled for a specific version - so we don't have access to the source code. Sure you do :) It's called decompyle
He is Guido's god damned son, lol relax guys.
This was my first idea but I don't have professional equipment (microphone and camera). I am looking for any contract work on websites but from the above answers it seems currently very hard for what I have to offer. So,probably making tutorials will be the best thing.
Yeah get your blogs, get your websites of tutorials, write books on the matter and sell, sell your services to people. Keep developing your skill set as people will want specific things even if its only small amounts of money or even more general coding use it all as practice, new ideas and creative ways to make money will come if you are hungry and keep trying!
Exactly. It’s true that it wasn’t exactly easy to port to 3.0 though (no libraries ported, no six, …), so with the 20/20 of hindsight, I think 2011-2012 was probably the sweet spot to start.

Op posts a lot of posts from kite.com and owlskip for some reasons
The cleanest way is probably to not do that, and manipulate properly parsed URLs instead: * parse the HTML fragment as a proper document * iterate on img tags * parse the src using `urllib.parse.urlparse` * `_replace` the query field by an empty string * serialise the result back to a URL * update the document &gt;&gt;&gt; url = "https://s3beanzoid.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media/django-summernote/2019-04-30/ec707c65-aa6d-4b81-a252-2fa1c1aef087.jpeg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAJZALJ3EN746L6QWQ%2F20190430%2Fus-east-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;amp;X-Amz-Date=20190430T021347Z&amp;amp;X-Amz-Expires=3600&amp;amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;amp;X-Amz-Signature=daf406a830d7d0f1ac2d631603b95e7e2ce0bdacd58d5a383d35f6dcd1466012" &gt;&gt;&gt; urlsplit(url)._replace(query='').geturl() 'https://s3beanzoid.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media/django-summernote/2019-04-30/ec707c65-aa6d-4b81-a252-2fa1c1aef087.jpeg'
It's also a completely useless compromise. The sub-80 wrapping is a function of older terminals and existing systems, if you're going to disregard it it doesn't really matter by how much, there's no reason to settle at 88.
You can't do that because you need to involve and thus reach the event loop. async is basically a promise in disguise that reaches the event loop for resolution. What you wrote there can't work because you are mixing two paradigms incorrectly: linear execution and event driven execution. In fact, twisted uses yield, and async is just a way of formalising that behavior with a neat(er) interface that allows things that were not possible with plain yield (e.g. async for)

Thanks!
Ok, thanks.
It would be 100 % more geek to have Guido's autograph under my Python code than on a pic with him :D
Clout, same reason we post said pictures on Reddit.
Lukasz is a core dev so it is probably easier for him to push something like that.

For web development, you usually have fronted and backend. For frontend: html, css, react, javascript Backend: python or java Start with python for backend as it is easier to learn. Just know there are lot of frameworks out there for web development, find what most requested in your area or what suits you best. And yes, there is no real standard for web development frameworks except for basic html and javascript
thanks!!
David is a pleasure to listen to not only for the insightful level of his presentation and skills, but also for the rhythm and tone of his voice. Much like 3b1b, we need more teachers with excellent skills _and_ a soothing, pleasant voice.
The issue is one of trust. We know Microsoft does telemetry by default in VS Code, but one can reasonably assume that they do not want to jeopardise the goodwill of programmers by doing something really shady. We know that Jetbrains also has telemetry options as does say Anaconda and pretty much everyone. Jetbrains focuses on selling you pretty nice tools so they have an incentive not to be shady. Anaconda, well I have not heard anything bad about them and I assume they want to sell you cloud contracts. With Kite we have seen you guys doing bad things from the start and I have no idea how you would be able to make money and operate ethically. The reality is that once those 17M dry up and you need to raise another round that cloudless promise might go out of the window. As the old joke about that poor Scotman and the sheep goes...
Thanks for the reply ! So what’s your opinion on what to start practicing first if you wanted to be able to mess around with both front end and backend developing ?
What about virtual env? Is it possible to install VM Box and setup your workbench there?
I see your EuroPython story and raise the stakes: I not only had a talk at EuroPython but Guido was in the audience and asked some good questions afterwards. Frankly his was probably the best, back then I think not that many people used Python for high load applications.
I am personally upset about this... I also use 100 and I tried to bring it up with black but it was a very undemocratic decision. [https://github.com/python/black/issues/290](https://github.com/python/black/issues/290)
In addition to what u/tenyu9 has said, also lurk around r/learnpython to get help on learning Python. I would suggest that you first get a reasonably good grasp of programming in general and use Python as a conduit to learning how to program. For instance, try solving some simple problems, they could be as simple as automating things you do around on your computer. &amp;#x200B; Then proceed to learning various frameworks, such as Flask and Django. Bear in mind that most frameworks are just programs written in certain languages. There is nothing magical about them, but they sure do help doing certain repetitive tasks more easily so you can focus on the core logic of your application. With most frameworks you get some basic User Interface (UI) styling or the frontend. Think of it as a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You don't have to learn those languages, but it sure does help. For look and feel of your web application you can also use readymade Themes. I suppose this would be a good enough start and then you can start asking questions on other relevant subs and Stack Overflow. &amp;#x200B; Not sure what else I can contribute here without overwhelming you.

Because he wanted a pic with Guido and is proud to have one? Nothing wrong with that.
Hi Wil Wheaton
Hey nice. I actually started using black a while ago. I don't some of the ways it formats but i like that it's consistent and makes formatting arguments go away.
Hey thanks for the reply ! Very informative and what I needed to hear ! Also thanks for the link to the learnpython sub !!
If you're still writing Python in a month, PM me and I'll gladly mentor you.
Thank you !
Sounds good, I will talk to you soon!
I think you're the only one that follwows the 79 chars thing. Most people use pep 8 except for that.
Try with [https://edublocks.org/](https://edublocks.org/) then. I think it is best suited for what you want.

&gt; Once it runs through the list, it just time.sleeps until the next morning. this is not a great way to do this. First, time.sleep can be interrupted or stay put longer ----- Suspend execution for the given number of seconds. The argument may be a floating point number to indicate a more precise sleep time. The actual suspension time may be less than that requested because any caught signal will terminate the sleep() following execution of that signal’s catching routine. Also, the suspension time may be longer than requested by an arbitrary amount because of the scheduling of other activity in the system. ----- What you want is a script that does the deed and is invoked through a scheduler such as cron.
As someone who hasn't used Black, how does it compare to AutoPep8?

How fast are we talking? Are these relatively static pages you want to interact with or are they fairly dynamic or javascript-heavy? Can you describe your use case a little better?
I'll definitely be reading the documentation more in-depth, however what I knew about Dash was that it allows for quick webapps to show analytics visualizations but I don't know whether it lets you create multiple ''reports'' for different people without them being able to see another person's report.
Do yourself a favor and take a moment to view the syntax of a go routine. If I was designing a library to work within the framework of the python language, then I would be more inclined to agree with the idea that I might need to _implement_ it like Twisted. I am not sure why you keep going back to Twisted as the litmus. Yes I understand how asyncio was built. I'm rejecting that it's a good idea to build it that way. Twisted was better than anything available, but it was pretty awful. When you've got the full power to start adding keywords, and change how the language itself is implemented, though... Python is supposed to be one of the most beautiful languages to use. But in the case of asyncio, it's fugly and clunky and doesn't fit into the actual paradigm of the rest of the python language.
Can I create multiple reports in a Flask website that are only available to the client in question?
HOLY SHIT HAD THE SAME IDEA HAHAHA This idea was inspired by my gf cause she always rant about something and I made this to make things easier. I made 2 modes for this - a random and alternate one import random def alternate(str): li=[c.lower() if str.index(c)%2==0 else c.upper() for c in str] return "".join(li) def alternate2(st): li=[st[i].lower() if i%2==0 else st[i].upper() for i in range(len(st))] return "".join(li) def rand(str): li=[] for c in str: choice=random.choice((0,1)) if choice==0: li.append(c.upper()) else: li.append(c.lower()) return "".join(li)
Can this be setup via config without internet? Or do I need to download this?
Data Analysis of some TSheets data.
You can see the pypa's guide here https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/.
using [random.SystemRandom](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.SystemRandom) (for the usual number generation with the usual python random functions such as randint, random, randrange, choice, shuffle, etc using a crypto secure seed) ,[os.urandom](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.urandom) (reading random bytes) or in PY3.6+ you can use the built in [secrets](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html) library to generate tokens (hex, raw binary or an url safe string).
I made a package called create-python-package, (https://github.com/cs01/create-python-package) but your bash script sounds like a good solution.
 try: guido.ask_for_pic(): except GetOutOfMyLifeKidError: guido.ask_for_a_pic_please_please()
I was in a similar boat. Knees back and hands...we just are not well equipped to work as we do forever. If you have never done programming before and you are more of a physical type of person... Then my advice would be, don't get wrapped around the axle trying to write the shortest or prettiest code at first. You will see post on r/learnpython and the likes that have replies showing things a bit advanced. Shrinking functions down to lambas doesn't have to be your priority, get the core structure and syntax down pat then once you have a few projects down try and get the advanced techniques. I've been a Python fan for close to eight years. I do most of my hobby stuff with it occasionally bring it into work. You can't go wrong getting a good grasp of javascript (callbacks can be tough to chew). This is mainly for front and backend web development with nodejs. For apps, I take a look at Kotlin. I do android development in Kotlin, and really enjoy it. Although I'd say the app market is quite saturated right now unless you have a brand new idea. Of course the hot new thing is machine learning. Check out tensorflow and keras for python. Also this channel does great explanations. https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk Last but not least, taken a cheap course of udamy or of the likes won't hurt. Best of luck to you! Take care of your body - we only get one.
Rip should've uploaded it and get 800 karma
Me too! I've got experience with other languages but new to python. Already starting to enjoy this language more than other programming languages.
Happy cake day my man!
Good thing you shared this on reddit cause I learned so much reading all the replies about improving this
So they are even longer than 3 hours?
Hmm no mention of flask, I was a little surprised. Maybe it’s just not that common in industry?
&gt; Do yourself a favor and take a moment to view the syntax of a go routine. Link?
Take a look at Rasa NLU. It does a lot.of what you want, and the website explains.conceots very well.
Hey man thanks for the reply ! I will def take your advice ! Yeah I know gotta try to stay as pristine as possible haha
Came here to say this.
If it's your first contact with programming language, or you're still a begginer then I'm pretty sure that you don't need a mentor. Get Lutz's "Learning Python" and read as much as you can. If you don't understand something then google it - I'm pretty sure that all your questions that may arise have been answered somewhere (blogs, StackOverflow, YouTube, professional articles about specific things) by someone. Give yourself a few months of digging in Python and related concepts, try to get what you are and what you aren't interested in and repeat learning process that I've suggested with new book that is more specific with the discipline you want to learn (e.g. ML, Django). Then may be good time to find a mentor - person who will find gaps in your knowledge and skills, who will help you properly understand things that you understand incorrectly, and who will and be able to answer many of your questions that are not very common in the Internet. &amp;#x200B; If you're a professional developer with no Python knowledge then of course things looks different.
If you've got 15 bucks you can buy a fantastic collection of python books from the humble bundle on the cheap
Most of the talks are about 45 minutes

&gt; it was a very undemocratic decision I mean... Black's tagline is literally &gt; The uncompromising Python code formatter. You're proposing a change to the defaults of a very widely used and trusted code formatter whose main features are consistency and PEP8 compliance. I don't think one user's opinion of what "future proofing" is should be enough rock that boat.
I didn't even hear about any other framework that Django on that list.
I keep getting a this is why I drink exception
IDK, FU.
Is this something that's recommended if you're already using an IDE that manages formatting?
According to timeline here https://python3statement.org/ that might be the last release for 3.4 and it is EOL now.
I've just finished writing a cookie cutter template for CLI scripts intended for internal use at my work. I'm really liking it so far. Auto generates a project structure with basic docs, sphinx configuration, PyInstaller spec file, PyTest. On top of that it also creates a GitLab CI configuration that includes optional stages for building docs and deploying to certain servers in our network.
No problem I learnt a few things but would have to spend a whole reading like 160 comments but I used the x=x+1 Can also be done as X+=1 which was useful in doing a password cracker which can use any ASCII string up to 5 characters and find it. It does does 7 million tries to guess ZZZ but ya know
OP Literally works for Kite, he says it in many comments.

I'll raise that, was a speaker at a small convention and sat with Guido at the speakers dinners. Really nice dude.
oh, that's a nice project! Congrats
The advantage of black is that all blacked code looks the same, because you dont have any options. So this is just an install and forget formatter, it handels every thing that has to do with formatting for you.
Shut up, Wesley.
It is more strict and forces a lot more changes. Especially in old projects. For me, ​AutoPep8 is more familiar. I just use `--aggressive`​ for better long lines formatting. And don't have problems with " instead of ' whatever I want to use. I don't fully follow black's line breaks, sometimes they just ugly.
I'm currently working on an API using Python 3 + Falcon and OrientDB. Quite impressed with Falcon and OrientDB resources/queries performance.
Sure, but many open source projects have dropped support for 2.7 as well. EOL is in 8 months. EOL for the community is not the same thing as EOL for the PSF. You can drop things early. Also, I’m sure not going to build a security bug fix release when the previous bug releases have binaries. EOL is effectively pushed up when that happens.
Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/bj8pi2/i_turned_15_today_so_i_made_this_perspectivebased/?utm_source=reddit-android What changed since then: - rendering is now based on faces, not lines - it now has backface culling! - screw cubes. it's now an icosphere - most importantly, dynamic lighting! There's a light source with a direction. And it lights up the mesh. How cool is that? GitHub: https://github.com/Forfunckle/python-3d-renderer
The best advice I can give you is expand your skills to a wide array of frameworks and languages, then try to get hired by a consulting agency. It's going to be impossible to get a job with such a limited skillset.
You can try freelance but I'm not sure how the hiring market in the us works. In Europe i haven't seen hirers for data scientist without at least a master degree. But give it a try and see what opportunities tou get. Don't blindly stare on NN though, while it is super fancy a lot of companies still do traditional machine learning (clustering, regression,...) so learn a bit on these techniques as well. The more you known the easier you are employable. last words on NN, make sure you can explain why you implemented a specific NN. A lot of ppl ate still in doubt and being able to explain it is the biggest selling point
_Citation needed_ At my org, we stick to 79 chars per line and have never had problems. 79 characters should be more than enough to express what you need to do, even in nested blocks, _and_ with sufficiently descriptive variable names (not single letters). I personally have found that if I'm exceeding that limit, that single line is potentially doing too much, and breaking it down in to multiple steps makes it easier for the next developer to understand my thought process, though YMMV.
Check out Anvil too.
he was probably just dismayed at being in cleveland. It's a common response, people go to cleveland and want nothing more than to immediately go somewhere, anywhere, else.
This could be done as an optimization problem as it’s a simple rigid body problem, but that’s not how this is done or the general case is done. The general problem frequently gets to be over 1 million nodes and acts on a deformable body, so optimization very quickly becomes impractical. Instead, the local derivative (the Jacobian matrix), which is easy to calculate and multiplied by the current time step and added to the current state.
Damn you :D But yeah, Guido seems to be a nice and insightful guy which, after spending some time with programming legends, is a nice change.
I work a lot with vtk and 3D rendering and I’m mighty impressed. Back in the early 70s, people coded thinks like this that would print out on dot matrix printers. I’m very thankful to be able to rotate fems these days. Do you still have support for lines? Also, a next obvious step is to add a colormap and apply a color to each node and use bilinear interpolation across the element. There’s also phong shading, which makes coarse models look a lot smoother :)
Can someone explain the usefulness of these data structures in Python?
I think you’re off on your numbers. People were well aware of room sized computers in the late 1940s (~75 years ago). Computers in the home became a thing in the 70s and widespread in the mid 90s (~25 years ago). Computers aren’t much cheaper today than they were in the late 90s, whereas the 90s saw price drops from $2000 to $1000 for a mid/low end computer.
Thanks, that's helpful. And thanks for taking the time :)
Fixing up my Florida ID calculator project. https://github.com/JoelMon/Florida-License-Calculator
The classes that I’ve written have no benefit over just using a list, besides educational. “But educating you to do _what_?”, you might ask. The time to roll your own linked list/graph/queue/hashmap/whatever is when you want to modify that behavior at a deep level. I made my own graph classes in a cryptocurrency program and it was very useful. A coworker made custom linked lists to represent data relationships in our app and it came out better than if we tried to use lists. Most of the time though, you can just put an interface over the built in data structure and be better off.

Analysing healthcare stats for research purposes
Thanks for the advice! I am 15 and I don't know much about shading techniques, but I'll look into phong shading anyways :) Unfortunately it doesn't support lines anymore because otherwise I couldn't import the faces from .obj files (and I couldn't calculate the normals, face centers etc.) The early versions still are still on the GitHub page though, they used lines instead of faces!
Thanks for passing on the word
Have you created a GitHub account? That's a good place to get some ideas on what other people are working on. You could create a simple web scraper that indexes links to pages, and maybe do some clustering analysis on the terms in the indexes pages if you're looking for a more advanced challenge. Sky's the limit! Maybe poke around on GitHub and try to find an interesting project to contribute to, could fix an issue they have?
Alright thats a lot!
Using python 2 ? That’s prehistoric!
It's not Python 2, it's Python 3.5.
Obj files include a line tag as well, so I’d consider it. I’d think of the face center of a line instead as a centroid. That way the centroid of a quad, a triangle, and a line are all defined. The centroid of all those elements are simple the sum of the positions divided by the number of nodes (it’s more complicated for other shapes). Regarding the normal for lines, since you’re using that for shading, you could just skip it for the line and assume they are facing the camera. The other option is to assume a side on angle is brightest, while a line perpendicular to the camera is dark. Regarding shading, the simple approach is to average the unit normals on a node from the neighboring elements and basically do a bilinear interpolation (for a quad) or use area coordinates (for a triangle) to compute the local normal.
Take a look at this GitHub repository: [https://github.com/karan/Projects](https://github.com/karan/Projects).

I don't know yet if black is exacerbating my laziness, but I sure do use the hell out of it. I want all my code to look the same, but sometimes I get indecisive about where to break up a line and black takes the decision out of my hands.
I keep saying I’m going to do a release of my open source fea project. I’m done with tickets, but I just reduced required dependencies yesterday and dramatically improved dependency testing.

This will also allow the interviewers to ask questions about how it fits into the bigger system, covering part of your option 3. As to your option 1: not that relevant for a lot of software development work. If the interviewers are interested in this kind of thing, they can get good enough a picture by asking. Finally, assuming basic code quality is there, what would interest me most is how you talk me through the code, less so what it exactly does.

I took this course in 2013. Since then I've nearly tripled my annual salary.
&gt;made from scratch in python Wait. How do you use scratch inside python?
Books like "The Pragmatic Programmer" are worth a read. It's not python related, and it's a bit outdated, but it's still relevant, and a good introduction to starting to treat what you do as a discipline!
For windows, yes. For macOS it uses Applescript to communicate with Spotify, in Linux that happens with dbus.
Ha
I think this is one of those rare occasions where a picture is really awesome to have. CS is very much still in its infancy and folks like Guido will be known as legends for centuries to come long after their languages are no longer used.
They recently changed it, you have to pay to take the midterm exam now.
No way! That sucks :/

This course helped me to get into Python and programming in general. I strongly recommend it.
I'll stay with nano thank you.
This is so helpful! Thank you!
Wait, I thought quaternions are the most suspect to gimbal lock...
I was looking forward to this! Got into Python from another EdX course, the one by Microsoft.

Here's this thing i did to solve one particular problem, but I'm going to make it sound like i solved the problem for everyone.
Github pro
No...the opposite. Euler angles are.
Nice reply, coach.
I’m still a beginner but I started with a goal in mind, I wanted to create a specific project. Knowing where I wanted to end is how I figured out where to start. Probably not the best way to do things but I just like diving in.

Good job brother!
Kinda heavy in Javascript just a website to purchase things... I know how to use get-requests and I currently have it to search the json file and open the webpage in about 44ms. Now I just need to make it select size add to cart and fill the forums.
I'm impressed. I saw the wireframe only post and I was impressed. I'm now more impressed. I'm 36 and do that stuff with libraries. I could figure it out, but I assume I've gone a bit further in math. I was doing geometry in 2d back then. The OP implemented element culling; that's impressive and requires understanding normal vectors...at 15. Coordinate transformations and camera projections are complicated. At least an orthographic projection is simpler. It at least doesn't get distorted when doing closeups.

Imo the best way to learn how to code is honestly via a book. Yes you can learn everything online but a book is a really thought through, checked and hopefully didactically well structured piece - If you want videos sentdex is the best as far as Python goes and the Python Docs are very informative as well. I've learned python with a book that takes a tour starting at how to install Python and what versions there are etc. continuing with all the control structures, OOP going through most of the standardlibrary, covering stuff like basic database interaction, concurrency, networking and finishing with various third-party modules and an intro to webdevelopment. I think having this structure, getting shown what the language can do etc. is incredibly valuable. I know there are people advocating against books but I've learned multiple languages from scratch, at times with books not even in my native language and it worked out great and I'd do it again in a hearbeat. In case you can speak German: Rheinwerk makes great books Otherwise: O'Reillys or "the pragmatic programmers" have good books though I can't vouch for their Python stuff No matter how you learn: having some goal (for me it was building a system that could easily analyse frequency response, plot nyquist plots etc. for various circuits) is very helpful and excercise while learning is the most important thing - especially in the beginning. To cite something I've read at some point: "You don't learn to code - you code to learn"
Thanks. I've signed up! I can't believe I'm enrolled at MIT!
You probably kept bugging him for the keys to the GIL
I was in the Navy for 10 years then had a sudden unprepared for shift in carrier. Then I went and got certified A+, Network+ and Security+ started my own white hat business... Got a contract and did well for a year. Problem was insurance and other benefits... I couldn't keep up and decided to put in at a position at a nuclear plant near by.
JetBrains suite. The free versions will get you 90% of the way there, but the last 10% are the most useful features. I'll probably pay for GitHub too when I outlive the free version
I was going to suggest "[Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/)", but it appears that they've monetized it (i.e., it's not free anymore). &amp;#x200B; Still at $30, it may be worth a look. Includes PDF and online versions plus videos.
lol
If you are still looking for a mentor, dm me
Also a 15 yo here, are you planning to reuse this renderer in a possible future? just asking out of curiosity
No, you already have the version you need, but you need to configure it as standalone; give it a shared directory to store notebooks and data files, set a password, and start it from your system startup.
How easy is this to do. And does this typically require elevated privileges?
This is frickin amazing way to go!
Whatever method is fastest to *you*. Some thing I only learned after watching a YouTube tutorial, others by reading about them in a book, and some other stuff I've learned from articles. I know one thing: if you don't *apply* what you learn (probably not all at once) by *writing code*, it will be much, much slower.
I paid for a handful in the last 4 years. If you asked me a week ago I'd say Pycharm (JetBrains), but I just switched to VSCode (after a failed attempt to switch to Sublime) and I'm *loving* it.
You mentioned sentdex bit I fell like I have to mention Corey Schafer as well 👍
It will require privs to register the startup script to the system startup service, and to create folders that Jupyter can write to and read from, store log files, etc. I can describe how to do it on linux, but I've never attempted something like that on windows. &amp;#x200B; This seems like a good walkthrough for you but it configures the external IP rather than just listening on localhost.

PyCharm and ACM membership.
NICE! Thanks for the headsup!
Looks awesome. Back in the 90s I used to write 3D renderers for games. I though it was a dead skill these days!
One crucial point is missing regarding Bitbucket. Using an external service might be fine, but *only* with *prior* approval by whoever is authorized to make such a decision. Putting company code outside of the company without explicit authorization is a recipe for disaster.
The total number of repos on GitHub isn’t exactly a stellar metric for language popularity in a specifc year …
Well, none. I'd pay if I were doing a commercial project, but I'm not.
Yep. Quite a valid remark. I edited my comment as I forgot to mention vcs and totally missed the point, that op's situation in his company. Well, origin master on company's server then. And good ol' Trac on localhost. :)

I purchased sublime text along time ago and I still use it daily. Today I was looking at VS Code but I don't trust Microsoft.
Processing code is closed source, cannot verify claims.
None, to both questions. My employer has paid for a PhpStorm license for me but I haven't used it in over a year (I prefer Vim). I quite like the JetBrains IDEs - they're very nice polished products - but I have no real use for them.
What's the reference? I thought I was old...
&gt; Corey Schafer seriously some of the best videos i've found.
Surely you've done more to increase your earnings than just this single course.
its deterministic for one. If you run black on some code no matter how its formatted or how many times you run it through it will always have the same result. yapf and autopep8 are not deterministic. The code style is well documented and makes some very logical decisions
Looks like fun! Congrats :)
Our made Scratch in Python before this? Seems like overkill but you do you. /s
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s. *I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*
88 chars per line is a data driven decision that coincides with “beyond pep8” by Raymond Hettinger So the author took several million lines of python code at facebook which was at a ~80. And formatted it with 79-120 line lengths and see which produced smallest changes. And the code didn’t change notably after 90 limit. 79 produced bigger diffs as more things needed wrapping but the data showed that most code seemed to be written for 80 characters with a 10% fudge factor. I just heard that Instagram was 120 but even they moved to 88 as the reformat really didn’t change that much, because 88 was already long enough for p90 of lines.

I’ve been an Eclipse guy, but I might have to give Spyder a whirl. I wasn’t fond of PyCharms either and couldn’t understand all the fuss about it. Thanks for the tip!
Dang, this looks amazing how long have you been learning python? Also if it possible I would run some anti-aliasing, but other then that, it looks amazing. Good job!
Best game eva!
Pfft. Real programmers use Notepad with the pokemon theme.
I got Pycharm and all JetBrains other stuff for free with student license. Works pretty good for me 🤷🏻‍♂️
First off, PyCharm has a free community version with the vast majority of the functionality. Second, what about it did you not like? What functionality was it missing? I'm personally not a huge IDE person, but PyCharm is immensely useful for developing and maintaining large codebases, especially ones that are collaborative. Jetbrains releases frequent updates and it has an active community, so I'm not sure what makes you think they haven't invested in making it functional.
Not all of them..
But it doesn't work with Javascript. Formatting is a pain. :(
(An arbitrary list to help you on your journey) You should have some high level of comfort with the following: Beginner: -Logic -Classes w/o Inheritance -Importing modules -List Comprehensions -Dict comprehensions Intermediate: -You've worked with a problem that was so challenging that you needed an outline to organize your thoughts or prepare pseudocode to grapple with the situation -You start to care more about how "good" you've become -You have tried to f*** with the language -You have asked yourself if asyncio is actually another programming language disguised as Python -You realized that you only know about 20% of Python, and that the other 80% is dark/mysterious/unfamiliar Post-Intermediate/Pre-Expert: -You actually know a significant amount of the other 80%, and can recognize holes in the available standard libraries or third party modules -You have trained many others in Python at various levels -You might even be one of those folks on Stack Overflow that consistently has the best answer to hard Python questions Expert: -You have written parts of the Python language/You are Guido
I moved away from Spyder because it just wouldn't work with a project I was doing at the time (can't remember why). I looked at Pycharm but didn't get the appeal either. I've landed on vscode and that's OK, but your post has made me nostalgic for Spyder again. Time to complete the loop I guess. And upvote for the reference to this blind acceptance of the superiority of commercial software. I use open source software almost exclusively because, as you say, it's orders of magnitude better, and I can feel reasonably sure that the motivations of the providers are not solely to fleece me of money.
I decided to break with Atom after his parents felt in love with Microsoft. I loved him, but I couldn't stand the pain after that. I've searched for love since then. Without success. Then I realized that the pain is what I need. So I've moved to VS Code flat and we live happily ever after.
The Professional EAP version comes with a 30 or 60 day free trial and they come out with new versions every month or so, so it's essentially free.
You are right, even the shiniest hammer wont turn a screw.
Try pip install —user pandas
You didn't want to use Atom because Github was acquired by Microsoft, so you...started using an editor made directly by Microsoft? I'm not sure I follow.
Also students and academics can get Prof version for free
The standard library in Python has a ton of components and it could take 5-7 textbooks to teach if entirely. I just think it’s a bit of an overstatement. I went through a few of the sections. I think the level of depth that you give to the topics makes the whole thing almost trivial... I understand this takes a lot of work to create, but if you’re going to do it at all...
Oh that’s too bad, I actually wanted to start doing Javascript soon. There’s probably better IDEs for web dev all around, idk I only ever used Pycharm and atom. I tried Visual Basic but didn’t like it so I just switched back to Pycharm right away haha
Not everyone started using Python because of its perfection, some of us picked it because the name...
go away /s
&gt; Then I realized that the pain is what I need. Guess s/he's a masochist

Finite element models. They're used in the calculations of aerodynamics, structural response, performance of medical devices, and manufacturing support. Shell elements are used to represent thin plates (thin relative to their width and depth). They can be used for say aluminum plates or composites. Beam elements (lines) are long with typically a constant or tapered cross section (so typically an I, C, O, L, S/Z shaped profile. Beams make up the core structure of buildings. You can also be fancy and use tetrahedron (tets; triangular base with a point), hexahedron (hex; basically a cube), pentahedron (pent; two triangles with the lines connected) or a pyramid (square base with a point). They're used to model all sorts of geometries (and even air or water) in order to solve a big linear system of equations. So for example, what is the deflection on the bridge when it's covered in fully loaded trunks? Will it break? Aircraft models are typically made of 100k+ quads/triangles. Part level vibration models are typically done with solid elements and can have 2+ million elements. Here's an aircraft fem https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj3i7D_0oDiAhXErJ4KHX6CC1kQjRx6BAgBEAU&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2F3s-eng.co.id%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw1cd-pblkDIAFUTdumq8Npa&amp;ust=1557017117711071 Here's a super coarse fem that shows the elements https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjwiNjS04DiAhXlzlQKHaPHDC0QjRx6BAgBEAU&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.en.ec-e.pl%2Fsoftware-en%2FMSC_Software%2FMSC_Nastran%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw1cd-pblkDIAFUTdumq8Npa&amp;ust=1557017117711071

Starting to learn python (feel a little lost) -already have some ideas "if this then this" style already laied out -but dont know anything as for now. It feels like i know whats needed, "then it should take table 3 of the Excel file and search for x near y" but don't know where to start
Maybe offer some real points you don't like instead of "it looks good so it must operate poorly".
You can check your network logs if you'd like!
excuse me?
Good job! This is awesome. You have inspired me.
Took this the last time they offered (jan-march 2019) you can do all assignments for free and also "midterms" for free
Thank you Python Bot!
You make me to grow up to be like you... and I'm 19!!!
No, there is no such functionality unfortunately. There was a way to compile Python 2.7 code to an extension and execute it in Python 3 like I showed in one comment, but psspy doesn't provide source code so that won't be easy. You could just create an app that interacts with psspy and creates API for you, most commonly people would create a REST interface and then user that API, there is also a way through command line (might be good if your interaction with it is simple) you could also use protobuf over TCP/unix sockets/zeromq etc some methods are simpler than others. As I said I don't know PSSE, but you mentioned different languages, if there is a C interface, you or someone could actually write a python extension using cffi and you could then ignore psspy and instead use that on Python 3.
CMD + N doesn’t open a new file is what I don’t like.
Nice! You working for a hospital or a vendor?
All shortcuts in Jetbrains IDEs can be customized.
It works just fine with JavaScript, complete with syntax highlighting and completion.
yep. I get your point. I'm going to do it all. The site is currently in beta. It's a lot of work and my working hours are like 12-14 hours a day. So I haven't gotten down to finishing the site yet. But eventually, I'm planning to add it. Probably not a 100% of the methods, but most likely something like 90% of it.
There is http://color-themes.com/ but it's a bit outdated and I usually find myself tweaking the colours as they almost always are a bit off for Python. Meanwhile, JetBrains introduced a new approach for colour theme creation, see the recent post https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2019/03/brighten-up-your-day-add-color-to-intellij-idea/ I expect a lot of new colour schemes from the community to appear as plugins.
I need admin rights to install python itself...
Go through the basic and intermediate python courses on teamtreehouse, that'll give you the 20% you'll need 80% of the time. You can easily get it done in 2 months.
I really liked Tower on the Mac for git wrangling. Loved it until they decided to re-license to the “rental model”. F that.
What's stopping you?
Nice work man. Now, I understand this is still early but I recommend learning how to organize your code better. Learn to format it and make it extensible. That would also be very impressive.
Man I have no other experiences haha. Graduated from college with a dumb degree and I want to be a data analyst so here I am. Best of luck to us both!
That's an impressive piece if work, may I ask what were you trying to model?
Looking amazing now.
Not sure where I'd start for something like that. Also I'm lazy and got no motivation lol.
Cool stuff. I used to do this in VGA &amp; C++ with tutorials from [flipcode.com](https://flipcode.com) when I was learning to code. I'm into the idea of making a software renderer again now, 19 years wiser!

Read up on Cython, and cythonize your code once it proves to be working, so it can become more efficient and fast by being translated to C. It can mean the difference between having enough resources to run something complex or not.

when you have the title "benevolent dictator for \*life\*" and then \*you\* step down. and people (incl. me) are like "ok, yea\~ i get that".
I’m 16 and very interested in coding, I’ve been able to code 2d shapes and such with turtle and pygame. However, they are already made libraries. Where could I learn how to build something similar?
&gt; If an IDE company spends more on visuals than on making functional, efficient software, its clearly making an inferior product, because in the end of the day an IDE is a tool. Whether something looks good or not says nothing about whether the company spent more on visuals or functionality/efficiency. This is not how a "red flag" works. &gt; It is faster than PyCharm, and does exactly what I want it to do, and it takes less up resources than PyCharm. That may or may not be true, but whether it is faster or not has nothing to do with whether it is fast enough for the functionality you get out of it. If it read my mind and wrote awesome code for me, I don't care if it lags every time I click the mouse. (I'm not claiming PyCharm is slow or fast here) &gt; In the programming world, it turns out that free things are orders of magnitude better than things that cost money. But you haven't said a single thing to back up this argument. It is true, there are many free things that are better than many not-free things. But then again, there are many not-free things that are better than free things. &gt; That is why I will continue to program using free software like vim, spyder, and ddd. I mean, great for you but this whole post of yours was bad.
I never understand people who approach problems like this. I mean, what'd you do? Hit CMD-N, it didn't do what you wanted, and you just threw up your hands and said "oh well this is an impossible problem!"? It would take 10 seconds of googling to find out that you can change every keyboard shortcut in a jetbrains product.
Your second project sounds amazing! Does your wife like the program? Will you be sharing the code?
i just started this a few days ago. glad to know people are legit recommending it. also how does this course compare with “python for everybody” by michigan state university?
You are a good man.
So, yea. Udemy does also. I recommed going to edx. They have really great courses and are from top universities. If you want diploma you'll have to pay around 70$, the rest is free.
WebStorm, and PHPStorm, also JetBrains products. Webstorm is designed as a JS IDE, PHPStorm is Webstorm + SQL/DB/PHP tooling. The big brother if you will.
How can you make a 3D renderer from scratch in python? It’s way too slow to do that.
&gt; With all the edx courses I've taken (7) everything is free except for the certificate Looks like you are out of touch. First they even used to offer free certificates, then they restricted access to certificate but allowed full access to the course. When did you last join the course? They have updated their policy and we no longer have access to Exercise or assignments. We only have access to videos. Try joining a new course if you do not believe me.
Please read their new policy - https://blog.edx.org/updates-platform-achieving-long-term-sustainability
The first two x0 lines extract the first dimension of each subset, so your linear regression is only using one variable. The second two lines in question expands the 1D arrays x0_test and x0_train into 2D arrays, so that eg. x0_test.shape would yield (20, 1) instead of (20,) . Post might be better suited for r/learnpython.
doing God's work
You mean that out of many variables it chooses only the first variable . But why do we need to expand 1d array into 2d.
Yes. That’s because fit() expects an array-like or sparse input of shape (n_samples, n_features). It’s all stated ine the scikit-learn API on [linear regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html#sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.fit).
Meh. Also: also from where do you draw the limited int range? Pretty sure Python supports arbitrary length-integers (Like BigInt or BigNum or whatever from other languages)
Very helpful man thanks. I was so hard for me to crack.
Took one of the edx Python courses a while back just to see and I wasn't impressed. I understand it's compsci but it was very cookie cutter in terms of algorithms and data structures and mostly used mathematical examples which are not very helpful in real life programming. On top of that using these sorts of examples is tedious and boring and won't inspire people to continue programming with Python because it makes it so dull. Looks like this course is similar and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who isn't heavily invested or interested in mathematics. If you want to learn functional real world programming that you would actually use in a day job look elsewhere. If you want to learn about algorithms there are far better and more interesting resources out there that will bring you up to speed much more quickly than what you'll find in these courses.
yah. Actually, I found the python int range from this site: [https://www.codingeek.com/forum/25/maximum-integer-hold-python](https://www.codingeek.com/forum/25/maximum-integer-hold-python)
Yeah, that's not true - may be Python 2 "Integers have unlimited precision." - https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesnumeric Open up a Python Shell and try their code, I got an Attribute Error for sys.maxint Also you can easily say: a = 9999999999999999999999999999999 b = a - 1 print(f"{a}\n{b}") And you'll see it has no problem with these big numbers and also handles the arithmetic correctly. I've also used Python for lots of math with giant numbers with projecteuler and the answers were correct so the arithmetic is correct even with more complicated operations
It's a good start. It only has 266 lines of code (and lots of blank lines). From here, it's just more of the same, until you're animating Lord of the Rings.
Actually the real computational cost comes from drawing it, which is taken care of by the Pillow library.
True, but that does not have much to do with Python.
I htink he meant that none of those things will be practically useful to the average developer. Researchers and tech leads are going to be a special case and can make their own rules. The guys is a compilers expert, and probably knows quite a lot about code generation and optimisation.
Personally i'm up to learning it. I have been using python for around 1 week. And so far loving it. Learning to parse large data from tons of remote machines. All very interesting. First script I made ran code in threads to ask for remote information. Oh man. As a powershellista, i've been wanting to switch. And with out a doubt already see the vast speed improvements!
Python will run on android FYI. not sure how to convert though. Also Java is very good for android. But i don't know how easy it will be to convert. You must be HIGHLY intelligent to develop that in just a couple days, never programming before! good job!
We all started somewhere. Good job!
Have you looked at these sites: * [codecademy.com](https://codecademy.com) * [pluralsight.com](https://pluralsight.com) * [safaribooks.com](https://safaribooks.com) &amp;#x200B; **or the books:** * python the hard way * violent python (for hacking) * [https://nostarch.com/catalog/python](https://nostarch.com/catalog/python)
First step is start learning python. Experiment, play around with concepts. You don’t need to build things, just practice different scenarios using the skills you learn “if I do this what happens? If I do it this way what hap— oh it crashes, why?” Second step is build a github with projects that show off your knowledge and capabilities. Don’t upload a messy block of code, have the source but also screen shots and a brief write up of what it’s about and how it works. I started with no experience and only about 8 months of python learning. I was hired as a “Junior Developer” our main language is Python but I also know JacaScript as well as HTML/CSS, I’m 29 and used to be an Electrician.
Ouch! Much salty today? Lol! That wasn't my intention though

Have you tried considering angle from vector of view to plane required? (Then brightness is proportional to sin(angle)/distance^2).
Yes he is really good. He covers good topics and real world application. I followed his Django server deployment guide and got my pi to self host Django real easy with his guide. 👍

I agree. I was just trying to say that DB isn't really calling the field stupid; he's just having fun explaining a wonderful theory heavy subject using Python.
You could try my code and see what I did. I used the basic concepts of perspective. Have a look into that!
Okay thanks
Awesome
Where can I find your code
Thanks, what do you mean?
Thank you, I'm sure you can and you'll get it right!
Thanks, I've been learning python for about 1 year but I had never made something this complicated before
Thanks!

&gt; I understand it, I just don't think that they're right, though. Then you don't understand it. &gt; Type checking is implemented into Python, Again, it is not, well unless you're just talking about manually using `isinstance` and its ilk. Type hinting is not the same as type checking. Type checking is vaguely implemented into IDEs and other ecosystem tools by analyzing type hinting, but there's so type safety at all, and even if things like mypy start performing static check optimizations, there is no assurance users will use the same setup This is pointless. Show us how to to perform static type checking in python
Hey everyone, &amp;#x200B; We developed a geospatial feature engineering library that allows you to extract features based on spatial information. Given a set of coordinates, you can get features such as the distance to the nearest supermarket, number of embassies within a certain range, and more. It also allows you to "compile" and share your features for production use. &amp;#x200B; As a backend, it leverages a data warehouse like BigQuery and OpenStreetMaps. We're planning to support PostGIS and the link in the near future. Check it out and hope it may be helpful for your work!

Program to show logs from your linux server in the browser. With adding users and adding logs users can see. Protected by form authentication. It actually comes in handy for me, I just create users for some managers and output to logs specific events like "User registered" or "User logged in". Keep those managers feel safe with knowledge system works. Also, in the main part, it's for me to see error instantly if someone writes me "shite got down for some user" and I'm on my way somewhere and have only phone in the pocket.

Hi, When you say “distance to nearest supermarket”, did you mean aerial or routed distance?
I´m saving this for tomorrow
I had to write one for CS 3rd year project 20 years ago. Even back then I had the impression that it was a dead skill because opengl and Direct3D were already much in use. However I am glad I did that course module on 3d graphics because it helps to know how things work from first principles.
Same here!! I learnt everything I know about 3D graphics and learnt c and c++ along the way from flipcode!
I did, but this course was my first serious dive into Python. I'd been learning Django without ever learning how Python worked. That might sound bonkers, but after creating a Django app PoC for a class, I realized I'd need to learn Python sans Django if I ever wanted to finish an app. So I took this class, got an A, then spent the next year building and deploying my first Django app, and it's that effort that got me my first gig as a software developer. I was a video journalist before this, which didn't pay that great, so software development was a profitable career change. Once I got a foot in the door so to speak, it was much easier to find and get jobs that pay good money. I still credit this class as an important part of this journey. It gave me what I needed to build my first app.
Yes
Hello, right now it’s a straight-line aerial distance between two points. We’ll definitely consider using routed distances, since they reflect the situation more accurately

JetBrains IDEA IDEs are most useful for navigating large codebases, refactoring and such; if you have a large Python codebase you’re unfamiliar with, PyCharm may be just the thing to work with it. If you don’t, it’s probably not worth the premium. (I haven’t used PyCharm, but have used their other IDEA products (IntelliJ (Java/Scala), CLion (mostly C/C++) and AppCode (Apple platform development, mostly in Swift and ObjC). AppCode in particular is useful when there’s a large codebase to digest and/or lots of code to move around, but not worth starting over Xcode otherwise.)

Professional programmer here. What we do is submit our code for review by our peers. It helps the junior programmers by identifying bad practices, bugs, etc. Senior programmers having junior ones review their code exposes (hopefully) better written code to them, which will showcase best practices to them. The seniors also benefit from this as well. I think this subreddit would be a good forum for asking for code review. I for one am more than happy to help.

This is such a general problem that no single post will show you everything. But it's good to see someone tackle a real problem.
\-Airing dirty laundry in public: Not cool. &amp;#x200B; \-Reitz is blatantly narcissistic; it bleeds through much of what he writes.
A json parser to feed data to a library patron system, sourced from a university ODBS
What's wrong with Twilio?
Yup, I loaded $20 on twilio a year ago and I checked the other day. Still got $15 in there, probably the best route
Interesting, didn't know this &gt; I think a lot of people don't realize how little Reitz actually has to do with Requests development. For many years now, actual maintenance has been done almost exclusively by other volunteers. If you look at the maintainers list on PyPI, you'll see he doesn't have PyPI rights to his own project, because he kept breaking stuff, so the real maintainers insisted on revoking his access. If you clone the Requests git repo, you can run git log requests/ to see a list of every time someone changed the library's source code, either directly or by merging someone else's pull request. The last time Reitz did either was in May 2017, when he made some whitespace cleanups.
I bet the author of this post know very little about bipolar disorder.
How so?
Airing dirty laundry in public is totally appropriate if the dirty laundry is "I solicited donations to develop some software and then didn't spend it to develop that software". But I'm reserving judgement until we know more.
&gt;Many people manage their conditions without causing this kind of harm, and when they mess up, they make amends, just like the rest of us. If someone can't do that, then as a community, we can have compassion but shouldn't give them power and influence.
I think "airing dirty laundry" is definitely the correct thing to do in a situation like this. Reitz is allegedly abusing his stature/reputation in the Python community and involvement in the "official" Python world (with the PSF and PyPI). Allowing things like this to go unspoken is exactly perpetuating the "missing stairs", where everyone "in the know" can workaround the behavior but newcomers are left vulnerable.
Interesting timing to air during the conference. Ick.
So I went through the first 5/9 videos, and will finish the rest later. Here's my summary: - Learnt a bit of the basics of machine learning - Set up an environment in python - Wrote the code which analyses a sample dataset about flower petal size which classifylies flower petal sizes into three categories (decision tree) - Next displays the results in a graph - Finally create a .png showing the decision tree logic Pros: So far I like the videos, learned a lot and was nice to be able to learn the basics and create something so fast. Cons: Not really much explaining in what the code used of the libraries that are being imported, which isn't a huge deal but would be nice. Excited to watch the rest! If anyone watched it please let me know what happens in the other videos.
To a large extent, yes. And that's worked as a good intro for so.e of my former coworkers. If you're interested in the process as much as the language, I'd suggest Allen Downey's "Think Python".
Are you offering to translate it for them? Or what's the offer?
dtype object means the data is not packed in any way. Consider numeric dtypes -- uint8, float32, etc,. These can be stored in a dense array, where there is some header information and then just a sequence of bytes storing the data. This is a "packed" representation that uses little memory and has great performance from some low-level details about how computers work. "object" dtype means the array library (numpr or pandas) couldn't figure out the type of all of the elements, so they are stored in a list-like structure. This is just a sequence of pointers, so the data can be scattered in memory which is slow. If you know it is of a certain type (number, date, string, etc) you can coerce it into that type which should reduce memory usage and improve performance. You might also get some new processing features that way.
meee tooooo
I'm pleased to hear that you like the videos you've watched so far! And thank you for taking time to provide me with Pros and Cons. I will definitely be more aware of the explanation level in further videos.
After consideration, I agree with you.

"My script checks for trending repos and it will automatically open a request for Chinese repos to write an English README" If this is not satire it might be the most entitled and arrogant post I've seen on this sub.

I guess it is very difficult to get a job as a software engineer like that. You should aim for internship programs, and/or outreach programs. There are many open source projects offering outreach. Look at Mozilla, Debian, Linux, etc.

What script? Your post is formatted badly. Also, I doubt "most people" or "most developers" give a shit about this.
This is why one should never put other people on a pedestal. Once you start idolizing someone you give them too much power and start overlooking their flaws until a point where they just explode in your face. At the same time you ignore valid criticisms, comments and other people who're not that famous. This happened before with the whole Pipenv saga. The community should always put the community above any single individual.

I never noticed that he turned his name into a github org. Wow.
Are you sure you want pycharm to run the code? That seems...weird. You probably just want to run the script with the python interpreter, no?
I'm still going to look up to Reitz for the ideal he represents regardless of the person behind it. Sucks that happened though.
Nice, now add threading :)
While I completely understand that the majority of job postings in our industry are specific to language or technology, it’s important to realize that program languages are just a tool of the programmer as a saw is a tool of the carpenter. In that vein, asking about “entry level sawing jobs” sounds a bit odd, no? All that unnecessary rambling to say: I agree with other commenters who have suggested learning data structures, algorithms, design patterns etc. These are the tools and concepts you can apply to ANY language/environment, making you a much more valuable addition to ANY team, not just “python teams”. Finally though: if I were to pick ANY language to learn with, it’d absolutely be Python. So good call and all the best of luck!
What is threading haha
Python's type annotation facilities, including the `typing` library, are mostly for static analysis, so they don't provide much useful functionality for your use case. However, you might be able to use MyPy for this, [especially `mypy.subtypes.is_subtype`](https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/master/mypy/subtypes.py#L54).
ok. here is my attempt to provide some value to others in a post. i.e., im putting on heavy continuous real-time filtering as i write. i dont social media, i have recently been skimming topic on reddit bc my new tab ext shows them to me. i dont post on the dev mailing list, and am indeed NOT a core dev. dear ken: sometimes, it is hard to see how were appear to others. even in cases where we can \_in retrospect\_ admit possible suboptimal interpersonal strategy, \*it would not have been possible in that situation\*, anyways... due to "mental illness" (i.e., significant deviation from the norm in some psychological process). i dont know you personally but i know the python open source eco system. and i have read the things of which many people speak. if i disagree with someone, i can think im right. but if i've disagree with all someone's, it means there is something i can't see but must adjust to. whenever it comes up, i explicitly dissassociate myself with 'sjw's due to the people who current self-identify as such. but im all about morality. kindness is a moral. but so is fairness. oss stands for "freedom" but thats it. oss was up till now \*mean as fuck\*. its like the math nerds getting bullied in school on the bottom of the social ladder became programmers who implemented that same system that cause them so much hurt. that culture is changing is a strange, emphasize the wrong points (and totally miss others) way, but still, change is good. but people's ability for critical thinking (the general type) is at a constant. they dont realize that a person who was brought up being harshly ridiculed and needed to grovel for help has a hard time switching modes. &amp;#x200B; dear njs: so you are smart, have an agreeable personality, level headed, people-minded issue-oriented problem solver. e.g., keeping the focus on the good/bad of \`.pth\` while not losing it when they next person completely ignores the progress made in the thread and said the exact same thing. one thing that may be worth looking at is the degree (not valence) of positive assumptions you hold on human nature. anarchy sounds nice. If i agreed with Rousseau and the mis-attributed concept of the "noble savage" I'd say "maybe, I'll need to read/think more". But rather, I'm much more in line with Hobbes \_only in his assumption\_ on human nature. I dont believe our society today is as what he paints. where you agree a lot or a little, Hobbes' influence at least gives reason to entertain its point. during my "viva la revolution" days, someone told me, "give them an easy way out". a public call out gets the sheep excited. people want to experience righteous indignation. that puts a lot of pressure on the accused. otoh, if a public call out is what it takes, then the whistle blower needs to be protected and celebrated. yet, kneejerk reactions in today's america heavily disfavor the whisle-blower. that term itself is loaded and carries a heavy negative valence. &amp;#x200B; i dont read responses/msgs/downvotes bc im autistic and rejection sensitive. cya! &lt;3

In the latest Talk Python, Reitz was the guest and did mention this himself, although he kind of wishy-washy said that it was because of security concerns.
And there's still a personal donation link to Kenneth on the requests doc page. Not to the dev team. To him. No thanks, I'll donate my money to some of my other favorite open source projects.
Thank you! This is very helpful
That explains a lot of the issues surrounding pipenv as well. I hope [poetry](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry) gains more momentum because it's awesome.
"QA With some automation" can be good for this, and to a degree, support and administrator jobs. But of course, to be an admin, you need other IT skills. To do QA With Some Automation jobs, you would need to understand Python itself (and I strongly recommend using 3.7.x and learning about new features like async and dataclasses). It is in my opinion best to learn PyTest. UnitTest is more predictable, and works a lot like other test frameworks. Nose (test frame work) is, as far as I understand, no longer being supported. Learning PyTest and teaching yourself to understand concepts like decorators, PyTest fixtures will help a lot. Plus, if you go this way, you can also learn Selenium for web browser automation, Appium for mobile application testing, and Requests or another HTTP framework to test web API's (such as REST API's). Because there is not always so much coding on QA teams, you will have a good chance to ramp up slowly, and if you put in effort, you can get a chance to create tool kits from scratch, and also to experiment your way to working code, which is all but the only way to really learn programming.
This matches with my personal experience. Reitz was rude in response to issues I opened on Pipenv, and afterwards someone better connected in the Python community than me reached out to commiserate over his behavior. Pipenv also switched from SemVer to CalVer specifically to stop Reitz from releasing multiple times per day, which seems like a sign of serious project dysfunction.
According to how he explained it some time ago (i.e. before this article was published) on Talk Python to Me podcast https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/208/packaging-making-the-most-of-pycon-and-more he doesn't have publishing rights since he also the main attack target. btw, as far as contributions go (without diving into which are more "meaningful") https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/graphs/contributors?from=2017-06-01&amp;to=2019-05-04&amp;type=c it doesn't seem that black and white as he is still the top contributor ever if we disregard his work before 2017-06

His responses in the pipenv issue tracker played a big role in making us (dev team) move to poetry. Making an open-source project is complicated but you're not helping it if you don't watch your tone a bit. Also, poetry work really better than pipenv for us, just configuring own pypi repo was a bit tricky
I'll give that a try. What I am currently doing is generating a dummy file with 2 functions, one with a return type of the output node and one with a single argument of type of the input node and doing a function call f_in(f_out()). I then run mypy on that file. Its working, its fast enough for users, but the solution is a bit complicated. I pytypes has documented is_subtype function in its user facing api, but it was throwing exceptions sometimes on valid types that I verified with mypy. I wish the internal mypy api was exposed and documented. The function you recommended is probably what I want but trying to find it myself was very difficult.
Planned or not, it's good timing in my opinion. People are together and can address it and move on
Also, author sat on it for a while, and has previously brought up the issues with him directly. It's not fun to read about, but it's important.
Awful to hear about this kind of an experience in OSS and python. I'm thankful it doesn't seem to be the norm. I'm glad he decided to share this experience, and I'm hopeful the discussion it raises can lead to better outcomes for everyone.
What's your objection to people voluntarily putting content warnings about abusive relationships, which cause trauma to people that experience them?
Holy smokes that's &gt;10x the going rate expensive. Plivo is $0.0050 / message. (I have not connection to either company).
It looks like mypy.subtypes.is_subtype won't work directly on type annotations. You need to create instances of mypy type objects, but its not so clear how to do that easily.
You can send emails with python without such libraries.
This post only cements the unfortunate uneasy vibe I’ve been getting about KR lately. I think what puts me off the most is the whole insistence on PoSiTiVity. It’s almost a defense mechanism on any criticism. The man is a master marketer though.

Since this is /r/Python I would recommend to open python shell and write "import this" it will print a Zen of Python. Python essentially became language that is called a "runnable pseudocode" and seems like that what is driving it. It forces user to write a simple and readable code (for example proper indentations are mandatory) although there's a lot of room for the programmer to help. I think the Zen of Python is a good starting guide, other things are is don't try to be too clever. For example python has a `reduce()` function where you can perform some complex operation and have it in a single line. I tried several times, and I never succeeded writing code that used `reduce()` that was easy to understand. I believe I wasn't the only one and that's why `reduce()` was moved from base scope to a functools library, while `map()` is still in the base scope. It helps to also look at other people's code, and even better, contributing to it, you often will learn new things. I also would recommend Raymond Hettinger's talks, he often talks how to write a beautiful python code. I especially like this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M where he shows an ugly code and how he could turn it into a Pythonic version. If you have a project that's not trivial it really helps to use type annotations. Some people don't like them, because it "pollutes" the code with additional information. But IMO these information are quite valuable and often help catching bugs before you even run the code, here's example what I mean: http://mypy-lang.org/examples.html To check the types you can use mypy tool, if you use PyCharm it also understands them and highlights potential issues. As a bonus it also makes autocompletion work and refactoring works much better. As for packaging the code, there's a lot of confusing and outdated information out there. People are also mentioning that setuptools is meant for packaging libraries, and for applications you should use something else. Actually, setuptools works perfectly fine with applications as well, it you can for example use entry_points to create an executable file on install that when invokes start program by calling specific function in your code. You can start using it by creating: setup.py file: #! /usr/bin/env python from setuptools import setup setup() setup.cfg: [metadata] name=myapp version=1.0 description=... [options] packages=find: install_requires= dependency1 dependency2 [options.entry_points] myapp=myapp_package.module:function In the directory create `myapp_package` directory and inside of it create `__init__.py` file and then start writing your code there. When you write `./setup.py bdist_wheel` (you need to have wheel package installed) it will create a *.whl file, that contains your application. And when you install it through pip it will install dependency1 and dependency2 (and their dependencies if they have any) install your application and create `myapp` in the `bin` directory of the virtualenv, to run it you don't even need to enter the venv, the app will automatically enter it during the execution. There are also other things that you can add, if you for example add `setuptools_scm` then you don't need to specify version through `setup.cfg` it will get the version from the last git tag.
Wut? How does that even make sense?
If you have a disorder that predisposes you to scamming people out of $30K you shouldn't be putting yourself in a position of raising money.
Time to fork this project and properly put it into the core library where it belongs. The last time someone talked about this, the response here was "Ken Reitz doesn't want that". Now we know that it's largely irrelevant what he thinks.
&gt;-Airing dirty laundry in public: Not cool. Protecting people from donating money that will be misappropriated is very cool.
Strongly agreed.
They say python is the second best language at everything. It's fun and easy to learn, but you have to pick a path. I think it can be a misleading language for some people because of how "popular" it is right now, mainly because it's adopted by so many fields. For example, something like half the people using it are working in quantitative fields. So if you don't have a background in stats, you'll want to narrow your study path to application development. Its not great for mobile or really even desktop applications right now, so you'll really want to focus on web development. These were sticking points I had when I started learning it. Again, for data science, it's your go-to tool. For the hobby developer, it's your go-to tool. For professional work, without a stats background, I'm going to reiterate you focus on web development and/or QA work.
If primary objective of his app is data crunching (CPU sensitive operation) then that might be a good thing to consider especially since he also said that has some C experience. If his code is business logic then I would advised against it, since it might add extra complexity in scenarios where the speed doesn't matter. Since we are talking about C, if there's a need to interact with a C library (in another thread he talked about PSS/E) for these tasks CFFI is much more suitable. While you can use Cython to build interface to a C library, Cython was meant for translating python code to C language (you especially get performance improvements when you annotate variables with primitive types).
This guy’s been the recipient of community-wide ball washing for years and then we’re shocked at his narcissism?
I don’t know what “orthogonal” means in this context. But bipolar disorder is not alternating periods of depression and mania. It does cause periods of depression and mania, though not necessarily alternating, and is diagnosed based on the frequency and severity of the manic and/or depressive episodes. A manic episode can cause someone to be irritable and unpleasant and act recklessly. And depression can manifest itself as anger. Everyone who suffers from a mental disorder experiences it uniquely to a degree. To make the dismissive assumptions and ridiculous simplification like you have is inconsiderate, and inaccurate. I’m not defending anyone or their behavior here so don’t get the wrong idea. But stereotyping a mental illness only adds to its stigma.
My only interaction with Kenneth was the talk he gave at pycon Sweden a few years back. He came off as unhinged. Pretty sad really.
&gt;Time to fork this project and properly put it into the core library where it belongs. Pretty sure it's not only Kenneth pushing back on this.
You have to have a good, simple, actionable idea first. That's the hard part.
I looked through his commits and it seems none of them were for the actual requests software. He worked on documentation, CI settings, the setup.py file, but it doesn't appear he touched the actual requests codebase.
His issue is that he is writing a new app, he wants to use Python 3, but one of most important dependencies is still only available on Python 2.7 and as a FU from Siemens company, they don't even provide source code. And even the python code is distributed using pyc and pyd files. He has few choices IMO: - write his new app in Python 2.7 and in the future port it to 3 (way after python 2 is EOL) - write app in python 3 (seems like there's a version that works with python 3.4(?) which is also EOL, but until customers don't migrate to a newer version his app can't be used (we don't know how long it will take) - write python 2.7 app that only uses that dependency and provides an interface (for example REST) that allows him to use the psspy, then make the python 3 app for his code, and instead of importing psspy he would just use that REST interface - if the PSS/E code provides C bindings he could use CFFI to write python 3 extension and used that to communicate - reverse engineer/decompile the existing psspy package and then fix it to work with python 3.
Sad to see you leaving but thanks for all your hard work!
If you don't mind, I'd like to give you some feedback. First, you got a couple of bugs related to edge cases. These are hard to find when taking input from the user, so try these cases: * `pswdinput = '\x01\x00\x01'` * `pswdinput = '\xff\xff'` Try them both both with and without detection enabled. After that, do you understand why the output is different than you expected? Do you know why these don't work but `'\x01\x00'` and `'\xff'` do? What is different here? --- The next big thing IMO is variable names. Quick, without looking at your code, what does `c` mean? How about `d`? `t`? `num`? You're gonna have problems if someone else needs to look at your code (or you in six months). A famous saying is "There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things" but it's good to try. Here's a suggestion by me: Original | My suggestion ---|--- `pswdinput` | `password_to_guess` `d` | `verbose_mode` `hd` | `very_verbose_mode` `num` | `current_attempt` `lists` | `password_to_guess_as_list` `x` | `i` (it's a bit subjective, but `i` is often used as an index and `x` is more usually a floating point value, from the way they are used in maths) `maxx`| `i` (`x` and `maxx` are basically the same variable, only one is used when detection is on and the other when it is off) `split` | `split_characters` `char` | `char` (no disagreement here, char is a common abbreviation of character and most programmers will recognise it) `t` | `password_split_by_characters` `c` | `detection_mode` `start_time` | `start_time` `loc` | `loc` is fine, another option would be `j`, which is usually another variable name for an index if `i` is already taken `times` | `total_time` `whole` | `successful_attempt` `o` | `show_password` (or don't give it a name and just do `if input("Press [...] password"):`) These variable names are a bit long but they are optimized for reading and understanding, not typing them out, because the latter is much less important than the former. Also, if you use a decent editor, they will autocomplete variable names for you anyway! --- Also, tip for the future: this: num=[] lists=[] # ... some more code that we don't need to replace ... def split(pswdinput): return [char for char in pswdinput] t = split(pswdinput) for x in range(len(t)): num.append(0) lists.append(0) for x in range(len(t)): lists[x]=ord(t[x]) is equivalent to this: lists = [ord(char) for char in pswdinput] num = [0] * len(lists) That's a lot clearer, don't you agree? It says exactly what you mean ("`lists` is a list of the ordinal values of the characters in `pswinput`, and `num ` is a list of zeros that is as long as `lists`") instead of talking about how you get those values. A good rule of thumb is if you see `for x in range(len(t))` there is almost always a better way (same with `for x in ...: some_list.append(...)`). Here's a little challenge for you, if you're interested: Replace this: for x in range(len(num)): num[x]=chr(num[x]) whole="".join(num) by a single line that starts with: whole =
Sorry to hear this. I have no dog in this fight, but I think it's only fair to make u/kennethreitz aware of this thread (if he isn't already) so that he has a chance to explain from his point-of-view or "*offer a public accounting of the money he raised and how it was spent*" as the author asked for in the blog post.
IMO PSF dropped ball by releasing python 2.7. That version was nothing more than backport of all python 3 features. It produced a lot of complaints: "Why should I port my code to Python 3? It doesn't offer anything besides unicode support and that's not a killer feature for me/I don't agree how it was done, Python 2's unicode() is better"
There are other reasons that people didn't want it in the standard library IIRC, including the slow update cycle of the standard library compared to an separate package. That's important when security vulnerabilities are found. Also, I agree with the opinion out there that the standard library has too much in it and doesn't need more. Pip installing packages ain't that hard.
I thought that pipenv and poetry are for different use cases?

Yup!
It would have been a lot easier for me to believe that, had it been posted before OP published on the blog.
Same here, I filed [an issue](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/1722) where pipenv failed to resolve things with no output, and his response was snarky and dismissive. I switched to Poetry, which is much better and whose maintainer is much more responsive.
No, please. Once it's in the core library it'll ossify just like everything else that goes in there. Personally, I'd like to see many of the core libraries pulled out and maintained separately from Python core so they can be updated more frequently than every 18 months, but still distributed with Python as pre-installed packages, similar to a Linux distribution.
You are correct. Thanks for the additional info.

Truest thing I've ever heard. My first internship paid $40/hour (in the Bay Area). Many starting positions in that area start at 6-figure salaries.
This [Requests issue](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/issues/2424) has been brought up before. KR opened it with &gt; There's a lot to this, but I'll keep it simple... &gt; &gt; Would the Python community, as a whole, benefit from Requests being added into the standard library? &gt; &gt; Would love to hear your thoughts and opinions on the subject! One concern brought up by multiple maintainers (including the author of this article) was that they don't feel comfortable sending it to stdlib when they have PRs to CPython going stale.
You should go through a tkinter basic tutorial.
Hooolly ✨shit✨ for Humans (tm)
&gt; What's your objection to people voluntarily putting content warnings about abusive relationships, which cause trauma to people that experience them? Trigger warnings are triggering people. We need trigger-free warnings about trigger warnings. Not to mention the word "trigger" itself which reminds readers of firearms. Will someone think of the children?
I was afraid of that... I don't think there is a simple out-of-the-box solution available right now for what you want to do.
Ah I think I might ask you for some advice if that’s ok?
How dare people be considerate and empathetic. Back in my day, we used to throw babies out in the cold and the ones who survived would be crowned "men" and allowed to live in society. The pussification of the millennial generation will ruin this world, unlike my generation which turned the world into a beautiful paradise for all living beings
[You say that as it being thrown out in the snow as a baby is a big thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue7wM0QC5LE).
&gt; How dare people be considerate and empathetic. How "considered and empathetic" is to talk about triggers to people who might have lost loved ones to firearm-related deaths?
wow you got me, how did i not consider that possibility. unbelievable lack of logical foresight on my part.
😂 thanks for that, hadn't seen it before even though i love monty python
Wrong. That's exactly what the “missing step” is about: once the abusive behavior of one person turns out to be enabled by the silence of a community, that silence needs to be broken to protect people.
There’s a lot of people like Reitz. Outright con artists who steal, modify and present code as their own ideas or act outright predatory. It’s important to call out and isolate these people.
&gt; Kenneth: We're very picky about which version of urllib3 you have installed for requests, very picky, because we need to be very picky about it; it used to be vendored. I removed certify from requests 2 because of security concerns, because if anyone was to get access to the requests codebase (which someone tried to do once by hacking my DNS for 5 minutes to intercept the GitHub reset email, it's this like crazy story, I blogged about if you want to see it) they could insert something into your trusted CAs, and then every major corporation in the world who uses requests would have a trusted CA that is trusted and their SSL chain would be vulnerable. And the only reason that is happening is because we can't trust system certs in Python properly, which is a problem that someone is working on, all volunteer time though so you gotta be patient. &gt; Michael: For sure, so, man, does that just like scare you to death? Like do you lose sleep that maybe somebody gets into the code &gt; Kenneth: I don't have access to requests. I removed myself from requests on PyPI, for that reason. Because if anyone's gonna try to get in, I'm the target. &gt; Michael: Yeah yeah yeah that's true, you're gonna get that spearphishing email or whatever. &gt; Kenneth: I shouldn't say that I removed myself, because that reduces the thing, but it's just a fun game I'm playing, you know? If that makes sense. There's no actual enemy, it's just a theoretical enemy, but someone did try to compromise me, and they did it targeted.
I’ve had a partner with bipolar disorder for 8 years. I can't find anything wrong with the author's assessment. His paragraph about the effects on others are spot on. Protecting people is the most important thing. The condition can't be an excuse for manipulative or abusive behavior
As a mod here, I'd like to highlight one particular point of this blog post: &gt; Since this is the internet, I have to say explicitly: Please do not harass or abuse Reitz. That's never appropriate. (And in case you're the kind of person that doesn't find moral arguments convincing, then consider: he clearly wants attention.)
Utter cock and bull.
Excellent use of slippery slope there, cheif. You're right, victims of abuse should just deal with reliving their past trauma; it's better than having to read the word "triggered."
I thought that it was wierd to hear KR in talk python to me, say he was dumping urllib3. It felt like a political move, since why not just work to improve open source instead of abandoning the foundation for your previous success. This makes me suspect the motivation was plain and simple that he’s worried urrlib3 improvements don’t align with his personal financial incentives.
Wow, that’s quite a difference indeed. Guess I’ll be looking around if the need for sending sms grows ;)
I've had the same exact experience when posting an issue on pipenv. Rietz just ridiculed me for a while before another maintainer stepped in and helped me out.
Which does nothing, since hackers can/will just target whoever are the maintainers... Like, not exactly private info there.
It's pretty suspicious, yeah. Not necessarily a huge red flag, but definitely odd. I don't know who maintains the package, it might simply be a case of poor planning (they might have published a release right before going on a holiday, having forgotten to `git push`). Have you tried doing a diff on 0.32 and 0.33?
mostly getting rejected from so many interviews given every night after office. I'm a junior javascript developer right now and since the people at current company are resigning I'm looking out too. But as others used to say javascript is a headache and other recruiters/interviewees are headaches too in terms of creating the UI as well as weirdness. Since I have a computer science bachelors and have done competitive programming and Java and Python in past I want to move to Python which I know but I want to take this learning based approach so please suggest me how can I do that? Mostly wrote an Blog application backend with Django and reading from this site : https://pymotw.com/3/
He's wary of this forum because some people were mean during some `pipenv` drama last year: http://journal.kennethreitz.org/entry/r-python If he does repond it'll be on Twitter, where he has a network of supporters to stroke his ego and tell him everything's ok.
Wow. First he clearly didn't read, then he investigated the problem and figured it out, but didn't acknowledge that he needed to do it in a way that doesn't involve pipenv --graph, and then he insisted on making the neutral and technical bug report personal.
Not really they do a lot of the same things. Poetry is even more powerful imo because you don't need to write a setup.py to publish a package. Poetry writes the setup.py file for you.
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar
I reviewed his code for “SQL for humans” when he first released it. It was crap. So many non-pythonic idioms and getting standard python idioms wrong (basic stuff like iterators vs iterable objects). It was a basic wrapper around cursors and has been done dozens of times before. I have no idea why anyone would use it, other than the name. He got lucky once and has been riding it out.
Yes, and it is freakin glorious
Right, so my understanding was that pipenv was targeting the "requirements.txt + venv" side of things (the environment), and poetry was targeting the "pyproject.toml" side of things (dependencies for packaging). These issues are related but are not the same; if they were, we wouldn't need both requirements.txt and setup.py. &amp;#x200B; Regarding setup.py, I thought that this file is only necessary if you're using setuptools to bundle up your code, and that setuptools is no longer required thanks to the pyproject.toml change (you may use, for example, poetry instead). I've never created a Python library or uploaded anything to pip, so my knowledge on this front is quite shaky. Is there something big I'm missing here?
&gt; No, please. Once it's in the core library it'll ossify just like everything else &gt;that goes in there. It's basically... done, isn't it? That's the point of going into the standard library... something is stable and its basic API is fixed. Things like Pathlib went into CPython and it didn't ossify; in fact, more of the standard library changed to allow Path objects to be used instead of strings.
&gt;Also, I agree with the opinion out there that the standard library has too &gt;much in it and doesn't need more. "Too much is never enough." - Jim Steinman .NET and Java have a lot more, actually. In this case, everyone uses Requests instead of what's in the standard library now. That's the exact use case for something being in the standard library.
And it’s going to make request3 a disaster. And he’s not even writing the code himself.
I think poetry tries to emulate what cargo does. In cargo you only need one project file (Cargo.toml) for libraries and applications. Poetry has the poetry.lock file that makes environments reproducible and also has basic venv support, so I'm not really sure what else pipenv provides that poetry does not. I haven't published anything to pypi yet, but the poetry author did an AMA here a few months ago and he said that poetry does indeed generate a setup.py file to make the packages compatible with pip and others.
Well, there's really no compelling reason for something to not be in the standard library that everyone is using instead of what's in the standard library. You have Python books now that bring up the standard library routines and then tell readers not to use them but to use Requests instead. That's the point at which it really should be clear it's time to add it. It's the de facto standard; time to make it the official one.
I have just knocked up a simple GUI for opencv and the image colorizing algo in Python. It's pretty solid actually. Windows only at the moment. I'll see if I can get it to run on Linux Mint next. screenshot: https://www.mediafire.com/view/6orn8vtg2qq7ld3/auto-photo-colourizer-screenshot7.png/file Download link: 163mb, portable app. Windows 7,8,10. zipped. https://www.mediafire.com/file/02o6ps72j3504bo/apc_v0-24b-Win_portable-all-files-in-one.zip/file Not publishing source code as yet, rather messy as I was just experimenting. I also wrote a webcam motion detector, source code and tutorial here: https://stevepython.wordpress.com/2019/05/01/webcam-motion-detector/
My guess would be your import is wrong. Does, by any chance, the .py file have the same name as your class?
Yup, and using a file source or an internal repo works perfectly good for things that don't have access to the internet. One thing I've really appreciated about go is their approach (generally) to stdlib/minimalism with the language. It's a bit extreme in some cases, but I don't think we would gain really anything by moving requests into stdlib.
Seriously what the fuck. Does the same logic not apply to Guido, Linus? I’ve literally never heard of this situation happening before; specifically someone *removing themselves entirely from commit authentication* because of *popularity as an attack vector.*
It does, actually. Is that bad?
Can you elaborate a bit?
you can read on github.
the problem is that I've seen explicit and endorsed references on python to PyPA, and it's the one that is most lilkely to be found by people when they google python packaging. The guy certainly had a lucky streak in directing visibility to himself.
as far as I know, pyproject.toml is to define which tool you want to use to build, but they fucked up so badly on this topic nobody really knows for sure, as you can put configurations of other tools in any other tools' configuration. They fucked up so badly it's not even funny.
poetry is nice (though to be fair, I'm still finding myself relying on bare pip+requirements+setup.* as they work and are well known in the ecosystem). But one thing I have notice, as a casual user of poetry, is that poetry's maintainer isn't always friendly in his handling of issues either. He has made Kenneth look like the only bad guy in the little war they seem to have between themselves. I think both can be bad form. drama... sigh.
I think you can put it in another file and subclass it using Restaurant.Restaurant
Ok, so he was indeed a prick... https://vorpus.org/blog/why-im-not-collaborating-with-kenneth-reitz/
Pillow [https://pillow.readthedocs.io/](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/)
Yeah I know what you mean. Poetry had a huge surge of popularity late last year and I think the repository was flooded with PRs and issues from all the users. They meant well but it's a ton of work to sift through all of that. If poetry gains momentum, some long term contributors might join sdispater and help relieve the pressure.
I am teaching myself too, since last August. The way that works for me is I have fun only learning about and making stuff that interests me. However I made myself get to grips with a GUI framework, Tkinter works great for me, so that I can make little apps for Windows and Linux. If you start at the beginning of my blog, it's like a programmers journey but with a zillion tips and (currently) 80 source code snippets, each of witch do something useful or interesting that anyone can build upon. You may also get the odd laugh as I take the p*** out of myself at how dumb I am and the trials and tribulations as I go through the learning curve. There are also full project tutorials and full programs to to download. Basically nearly a year's work. I don't make any money out of it, it's a free site on word press and everything is totally free. I just wanted to share my shit with other programmers. Regards Steve. https://stevepython.wordpress.com/
Corrected.
There had been talk of putting it in the standard library because like you said the API isn't going to change. It was ultimately decided against due to security concerns; Requests can respond to CVE's and release a new version more quickly when it's not following the standard lib release cycle.
I'm a python novice but I'm happy to chat.
I'm not experienced with iterators or generators. What is the specific issue here? That he re-implemented something in a broken way that's been done before?
Thanks for the advice. :) I do have a follow up question. What do you mean by my own projects? Like, make little programs of actual use, or more like the stuff on r/dailyprogrammer that shows the use of different functions to solve complex problems?
So python packaging is a probably a wart of the language, despite it being orthogonal to the language... 1. Python packages rely upon system dependencies but those dependencies are not captured inside of python packages. This is probably okay for many python packages, but a number of packages rely upon 3rd party libraries. 2. Pypa is overly opinionated about how a package should be built, which makes it difficult to progress towards a working solution using pip (they built pip). As an example here, try finding ways of handling when you want to use a forked version of the package because it's broken in your environment... or if you want to use a private package not available on pypi because it's proprietary... 3. Up until the inception of `pyproject.toml`, the only real way to install something was to use `setup.py`. Most (like nearly all of them) packages on pypi have a `setup.py` file in them. Honestly, `setup.py` is not that bad and because it's a python file, it gives you a lot of power that a DSL just can't. 4. `pyproject.toml` intends to replace a number of different files that are currently being used within a given package's root folder, but those files are not ubiquitous and `pyproject.toml` doesn't really add much to the python ecosystem other than _yet another standard_. Note here: Pypa (the PSF sanctioned group that owns python packaging) created the `pyproject.toml` file. It is (or will be soon) supported by `pip`.
Is it bad that it makes me wary to contribute to Open Source at all? I read all the time about all the bureaucracy and personalities. With personal projects it's a lot less stressful.
work 2 free projects get a job work no free projects and get no job which is better question of the day?
even if you object to this one line, the rest of the article is reasonable
This is pretty cool. I haven't built a web app but it seems like it would be well suited to this. Take a look at Flask. An added benefit to building a web app is that anyone at the Meetup could use it, not just those with the program installed on their phone.
Why does someone do this? Is it to stroke his own ego as a "brand"?
Exactly this point applies to celebrities too
I've interacted with Kenny a few times and always found him nice and genuine. Being a maintainer is largely tedious, thankless free work.
&gt; the rest of the article is reasonable It is.
You probably need 3 projects that are relevant to your desired job.
are the prerequisites a mile long?
Build your github for free and network as hard as you can, but get paid for the contracts you do.
Well then I'm afraid I must disagree with Jim Steinman. (also... whodat?) 1. Pip install ***just ain't that hard***. 2. Think of how many times Turtle graphics is moved across the internet per unit time thanks to its inclusion in the standard library. Now think of how many people actually use Turtle graphics. Repeat this for every other package in the standard library that nobody cares about. 3. Python development is completely open source and notoriously underfunded. It's silly to ask open source developers to maintain packages that nobody uses because they were deemed "standard" a long time ago. Java and .NET are maintained by large corporations with money to burn. 4. For security-conscious packages, as I mentioned above, the update cycle needs to somehow coincide with Python's, otherwise there may be trouble. 5. "Appeal to Java" is truly the worst logical fallacy one can commit. Were I a benevolent dictator, I would use the Python 3 to 4 switch to clean up the standard library.
Are these books good?
I have known Kenneth since before all the “fame” he loves Python and the community. He has grown and experienced all the ups and downs that come with it. I have seen people gush(shockingly) over him merely over code he has written, and most of the commenters a couple of years ago would have been thrilled to talk to him. Not handling this issue privately and everyone coming in here and bashing him for whatever shortcoming or perceived slights against you is complete bullshit. These are interpersonal issues and should be handled privately imo. **he was rude to me in a PR** or **he made me leave OSS** He gave most of these people opportunities to contribute and collaborate on a large profile project, and showcase their talents. Community is the reason Python has special place in my heart but having moved on in most recent years it’s sad to see it’s become people looking for notoriety and fame by complaining about personalities or project shortcomings. I don’t know the author but I hope you think about what impact this sort of thing has on this specific person. As for the money I am sure it will come to light and it is serious concern. I hope it is resolved soon.
what prerequisites did they require?
Frankly if you're getting to the point where debugging is a problem, I would use multiprocessing to clearly separate the concerns and allow the OS to enforce an even distribution of processor juice. That way you can debug the various bits as if they were seperate apps. A good example is a server -- wait for sockets or sleep is one process and handle the data is another. That way you never have to worry about blocking. Asyncio's main use case is having a single app manage a lot of related tasks that rely on input/output operations with the network/db/file system.
He basically stole 30k in donations, that is not a personal issue.
You know, I wouldn't even have a problem if that $30K was used on computers, booze and hookers if it was compensating Reitz for *doing the work on Requests 3*. If it compensated him for his time, fine and he could spend it however he liked. But the fact that he admits he can't do the work without someone else and won't pay that person to do it, meaning there won't be a Requests 3, is the real kicker for me.
Actual programmers who enjoy programming have been doing so independent of these predators anyways because it is a very introverted and self motivated field as a hobby. If you enjoy something, do it, don't let these turds stop you from pursuing that. I know how you feel though, because after putting in so much work and some dude just swoops in and takes what you did, re-brands it, and then says he/she made it, it can be infuriating. With proper credit and making sure you publicly release your work and not to any individuals, I think you'd be fine. I don't really know any good personal projects out of the top of my head but if you'd like to work on something with me, I'd be more than happy as I'm looking for something to work on and I have very similar concerns to yours. I'm newer to Python (only been dabbling in it for about a year) but I have a background in electrical engineering and have been coding otherwise since I was much younger.
Is there any way to test if the email you sent worked?
The above comment made me lol
If he kept the post to that I wouldn’t have any issues. It was mostly a personal attack.
Tell the story!
There are plenty of good arguments for not adding it to the standard library, with the biggest ones being release cycle and compatibility issues. Right now, the maintainers can push out a new release whenever they think it's ready. If it's in the standard library, they have to wait for the next time *Python* is ready to release. And right now, if they want to do a major-version bump that breaks compatibility, they can. If it's in the standard library, that becomes at least very difficult and perhaps impossible.
What is your disability?
Rebuttal and/or critique is important regardless of timing. I don't hate the guy over these revelations, perhaps he can publically recognize the issue and work with the community to heal.
Clinical depression and anxiety disorder. Diagnosed, been to therapy, currently on medication, but it seems that my current state is as good as things are going to get. Had it for 12 years now.
Just looking for honesty in advertising
An iterable object implements the \_\_iter\_\_ function that can return an iterator. The iterator is like a view into the iterable object that keeps its own state. In [1]: foo = dict() In [2]: type(foo) Out[2]: dict In [3]: type(iter(foo)) Out[3]: dictionary-keyiterator An iterator should have a next() method, an iterable object should not.
Depends entirely on how you're implementing it and what you're actually going to be doing with the data.
Pillow, numpy, and scikit-image will do almost everything you could need. Maybe throw in openCV for edge cases, and imageio for reading/writing, and you're sorted.
Sadly I think there are tons of developers who would rather get 30.000$ to head up a disaster than to responsibly run a project. I applaud Nathaniel Smith for being honest about this, I think due to the good spirited nature of open source development you have tons of other developers out there getting taken advantage of who don't speak up for fear of angering "important" figures in the community.
here is my thoughts based what is going on with mozilla right now and people like Hillary Clinton's tech guy needing to look up how to use bleachbit and apparently not knowing that secure-delete is not turned on by default and also big companies starting independently out of a basement. I think Tech companies should re-work their hiring process cause honestly they are hiring idiots and better suited people are not getting in.
Ok I guess it's a lazy loading thing? I've only written Python for my personal use and I never design APIs or anything so everything I do in Python (and other languages) operates in memory or is loaded from disk.
Fluent Python is excellent

I understand what it means in a math context. But I’ve never heard it used in this sense and can’t seem to find it in any online dictionary used this way. If you have a link or a source that would help me.
Following as I have the same question
At least with open source the commits log doesn't lie. But I doubt my ability to contribute meaningfully to large projects aside from bug reports. So for now I'll stick to personal projects
Looks really great!
It's pretty normal for programmers to use it in this meaning. [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/orthogonal) covers that usage: (software engineering) Of two or more aspects of a problem, able to be treated separately. The content of the message should be orthogonal to the means of its delivery.
&gt; If you look at the maintainers list on PyPI, you'll see he doesn't have PyPI rights to his own project, because he kept breaking stuff, so the real maintainers insisted on revoking his access. &amp;#x200B; On the [Talk Python To Me podcast episode 208](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/208/packaging-making-the-most-of-pycon-and-more) (\~40th - 42nd minute), Reitz explained that he removed the PyPI rights because he was too large of an attack vector for individuals wishing to comprise the Request package.
My advice to you as someone whose been programming for a long time is that, getting involved in projects with other people is usually good to push you into getting out of your comfort zone and learning things out of necessity to make a contribution as long as you can document your contributions. As you mentioned, making direct contributions to open source projects with log files will ensure that your contribution is there and you can use your contribution to that you can leverage them to obtain jobs, etc. The problem comes when you send people your code or someone posts your code without your permission (as happened with me with an individual).
I'm the descendant of Gustave Eiffel, and I need to liquidate the estate, so how do you feel about buying the Eiffel tower for scrap?
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar.
:) Fair enough. Reitz's explanation sounded reasonable to me.
It's utter bull. The same attack vector can be used against any other with commit rights, as well as against any other high-profile OSS project. I've never heard such an elaborate load of hand-waving before from any other project. Have you?
Man I can help
There is current talk of a requests3 and Tom Christie has been working on requests-async to make it async, so I don't know if it can be called done.
It's a condition I know almost nothing about, are there medications to help control it, antidepressants maybe? It must be good for your partner to have you for so long
[It sounded like this.](https://youtu.be/sY_Yf4zz-yo)
Not sure why those commenters were up your ass about reviewing the code. Maybe they've never had to work with a garbage code base before and spend all week either refactoring the garbage or hacking together a crappy solution with what you have to work with, and which would otherwise take a few hours to do. Just for the record, anyone who calls a legit code review "code shaming" probably isn't someone whose code I'd ever want to use, and they should probably find a different skill that doesn't involve planning, designing, testing, learning, improving, or having standards.
Python 3.7.2 - +1 for they using a current version!
Send one to yourself. I do this all the time at work. I have several computers around the Courthouse that I only use occasionally. I set them up to email and text me when they booted. That way, I know they are ready for me to SSH in and what their IP is.
Q: Which is worse Python drama or YouTuber drama? A: Trick question. They're the same.
No I mean like test it from the program to see if I have the right provider
Ithink in python2 there were a max int, but your int was automatically converted to a long
She does! Too bad its basically a tease at this point, until I figure out how to run it from a website or mobile app. I would be happy to share the final code but all the elegant stuff is just existing code I've strung together. About the niftiest thing I did was just get the OCR bounding boxes to merge long the Y axis of the image so that the program could match prices with the receipt item.
Yea I'm starting to lean toward a web app after seeing how crazy it gets trying to package stuff for Android, there's like 10 different solutions but they are pretty hellish for a beginner like me, ive tried about 3 and never come close to getting anything to run. I'm still sort of reluctant because there are plenty of issues with getting it set up, I figure it will be about as much of a headache as me trying to learn to recreate the program in Java or Swift so I'll just have to start poking around Flask and Django on Monday and see what I can do.
No joke. The guy even open-sourced his own genome on Github. He's not just a narcissist, he think he's a genius demi-god that others will want to clone in the future.
I suppose I never thought about how it would apply in a non-technical or math sense. In your example the message and means of delivery are (or should be) independent from each other, but are also both necessary and contained within a larger process. I can see how it might be used in other contexts though. Thanks for sharing.

I credit the speed with how flexible Python is and how easily I can just strap together existing code, the movable table rows (PyQt5) and the drag and drop receipt selection (Pygame) were straight up Stack Exchange answers. I think my biggest input was just getting the various words pulled from OCR to merge together as receipt items+prices but that wasn't too hard, just using the bounding boxes of the words and checking for other bounding boxes with a y-coordinate within ~7 pixels and even that wasn't perfect since it requires a 1:1 item to price ratio, I still need to flesh that solution outt and have it focus on price and add additional lines below that don't share a y-coordinate with another price (to account for multi-line item descriptions).
Thanks Smik
Does anyone think that if there were a critical security issue that Python would sit on a fix for it? Otherwise this reason would warrant pulling all the Internet-facing libraries - FTP, HTTP, SMTP, etc. out. I can't think of a major language that doesn't have a suite of network and internet protocol libraries in their standard library nowadays. This reason just doesn't sound plausible to me.
The import should be: from Restaurant import Restaurant In Python a module is simply file. Modules can contain classes, functions, and variables. When you import something you can either import the entire module (as you’ve done) or you can import a part of that module (like a specific class)
Your second edit is incorrect. The parent class does NOT need to be in the same file.
The requests team and Python core developers think it's plausible, I guess you can take it up with them if you disagree.
I guess it's this: https://youtu.be/avWJs6Oa73c He comes across as somewhat eccentric at times, but see for yourself. It might just be that his cultural background is utterly incompatible with the Nordic frame of mind.
Thanks. I thought Pillow was something else, but after reading into it, it seems it's what I was looking for.
Sorry, I should have realised that you'd have known that. Or found it in the first 5 minutes of starting a project like that. I'm going to save face and pretend that I said it so that someone who was reading it and didn't know that might have seen it.
Curious. What happened with pipenv?
MI environment ? Don't you mean ML environment ?
You don’t need to develop Uber or the Next PayPal. You can reinvent the wheel and it can be like an exploratory study of an idea or a concept. One of my demos was connecting to an API via python that gave me the ISS’s coordinates, I then made functions that accounted for the curvature of the earth, grabbed a second set of coordinates and then compared the two coordinates to get the ISS speed. I then pushed these coordinates to a Google Map API so you could see on a map current where the space station would be located. Serves no purpose but it demonstrates understanding of using functions, APIs, handling data, etc. I also made super basic ones that were more design focused and showed off my design skills, like a nice currency converter. Then also pure python projects. One was a Vigenere Cipher, that was a good one to start with. Encrypting a message and decrypting it. 80% of my interview was getting to know me, they were fully aware I had limited experience but were prepared to train the right person.
It was overly enthusiastically hyped as the PSF recommended packaging method, while not being ready for prime time. It resulted in a few flame fests here in /r/Python and some rather unhinged commits to the pipenv repository.
Are you saying that they specifically gave "security patches might not be released in time" as their reason for not including it?
At what point should we consider it stable enough, though? Like another commenter pointed out, Requests is pretty much "done". A version jump that isn't backwards compatible doesn't seem likely or necessary at this point.
I find it hard to believe that there wouldn't be a patch released for the standard libraries if a security vulnerability was found.
The ability to respond to security changes is reads like the primary reason to me: https://2.python-requests.org//en/master/dev/philosophy/
If he removes himself, the attackers will just go after whoever is maintaining it. "I'm too famous to be involved" is a ridiculous excuse.
And politicians and political parties.
I’d like to point out that $5K for an async project in testing is valid. More so in cloud credits, than the PC itself, but large scale asynchronous is worth the money.
So I'll admit to being ignorant about security stuff, but here are some thoughts: If you patch the standard library, that means that you need a new patch version for Python, correct? So if we're at 3.7.3 now and a vulnerability is detected, you'll need to put out 3.7.4. This process will almost certainly take longer than someone patching the single library they maintain. I imagine that security vulnerabilities are time-sensitive and need to be jumped on quickly. I also suspect that the open-source and underfunded nature of Python also means that putting out new patch versions rapidly is a non-trivial task.
Someone can explain why they didn't work on the setup.cfg and make a brand new file for that purpose?
His handling of issues (especially bugs) was half of why I created [dotlock](https://pypi.org/project/dotlock/).
That's hilarious! I hope the writes of Silicon Valley include it in the next season
The same considerations go for urllib. Somehow we seem to manage.
If I were Reitz I would sue for libel. You can't publicly attack anyone you want at no cost.
Reitz not Rietz.
Fair point ¯\\\\\\\_(ツ)\\\_/¯
Can you point out which parts are actually libellious?
Best practice is generally to keep all file/module names lowercase, and only use capitals on the actual class name. That way `from restaurant import Restaurant` is unambiguous about which is the class and which is the module that contains the class.
Wow, that's a really dead sub
There's several payment packages for Django. I don't have the time to comparer them to Omnipay. Just check out the payments (or whatever it's called) category on https://djangopackages.org/ Also, there's /r/django
Interesting. Direct quote from the book I'm working out of: "When you create a child class, the the parent class must be part of the current file and must appear before the child class in the file." Guess I've got some more experimenting to do in order to nail down how this actually works.

He's literally J.P. from Grandma's Boy.
That doesn't seem right at all to me. What are these tests supposed to be doing where $5k makes sense? I can't imagine any type of workflow where that would be reasonable in terms of hardware cost.
That only works if it's not true. Is it not true?
I beg to differ on the 'not fun to read about'. This is tabloid material for programmers. I'm withholding final judgment until all the evidence is out, but so far it seems pretty damning, and the author has likely just done a huge service to the Python community. Taking $30k and not doing what you promised is terrible stuff.

Is he, though? Only two of his projects have significant adoption despite many, many forays into already well coveredground. And one of his popular libraries (pipenv) is notorious for controversy and flat out rudeness to issue reporters. He's been driving his own brand steadily into the ground in the last year or so. And he's only managed to interest folks in his software creations despite endless self promotion of music, writing, and photography. Now, if you want to talk about master marketers in the python community, let's talk about Dan Bader and Michael Kennedy. (Both of whom I respect a great deal)
That's what he says all the time even though at least 75% of use cases are held in common.
His comments on Poetry during that interview seemed really condescending and also not accurate.
I will point you towards Openpyxl.
wat did i just read
Presumably so that a bunch of people contribute code and he gets as much credit as possible. It's minimizing the contributions of others.
And I will go there now, thanks for the tip.
Do you have an approximate timestamp? My skin started crawling within the first five minutes. Seriouslym, who want to listen to that level of brown-nosing?
Putting it that way sounds like the work of a total narcissist
Although I [recently had my own negative interaction with KR](https://twitter.com/knowsuchagency/status/1121197076790951936), I genuinely hope he gets himself professional/interpersonal help for his narcissism. I think he's owed a debt of gratitude for his work in the OSS community, but manipulating others and enriching himself off their work is beyond the pale, ESPECIALLY as someone on the board of the PSF. IIRC, Python is the only language of its popularity who's development is done entirely on a volunteer bases through the non-profit organization that the PSF is. I have sympathy for this mental health issues, but abusing the social capital he's gained and the trust of others like this is bad for Python and OSS. I'm glad Smith spoke up about it.
It does need to be imported in to the file. But it doesn’t have to be defined in that file.
At some point the discord that's linked from /r/Python had a "Rockstars" user category with one member. I'll hand out a free atomic wedgie to anyone making a wrong guess at that user and the amount of associated ass-licking.
Ah, OK. Sounds like they oversimplified in the book, since it's for beginners.
Did he do the work, or just manage to trick people into believing he did it? As of now, there's no point in denying the rabbit hole. We're only left with the discussion of how deep it goes.
I think you won for dumbest thing I read today. Congrats! Celebratory tea is at noon on my veranda if you're free

[https://github.com/teenageknight/subreddit\_online\_users](https://github.com/teenageknight/subreddit_online_users) When it comes to the actual graph, I needed some help spacing out the times so I took some inspiration from [https://github.com/TinyQubit/RedditBot\_OnlineUsers](https://github.com/TinyQubit/RedditBot_OnlineUsers), as well as on MD. However, the rest I did by myself by reading documentation. Just wanted to share.
I'm puzzled by this blog post. It seems like the reason the blog author isn't collaborating with Reitz is because Reitz refused to hire him, and decided to take the job for himself instead. I don't see why it was improper for Reitz to do that.
Yeah that is confusing.
I am not sure any other countries, but I'm the U.S. truth is an absolute defense against libel. True statements are immune from libel, no matter how damaging they may be to someone's reputation (disclaimer: IANAL, but my wife is and I helped her study for that class)
That's a pretty shallow reading.
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*.

It doesn't have async support yet. Maybe that will require or inspire some breaking API change, which it can still do while it's not part of the standard library.
lol. Since you have the input data already, you should try horse racing this against a simple markov chain method. This is the cheapest way to get semi-coherent grammar (higher probability a verb follows a noun, for instance).
The likely situation here is that the event actually happened, and the people who have to "work around him" used it as a good excuse to keep him out of the kitchen. "Sorry man, we'd totally want you back, but them hackers, y'now..."
To be fair, the results are about as coherent as his tweets
I use requests, requests-html religiously, but I have to ask, is Reitz the DJ Khaled equivalent in the open source world?
Thats a good idea, I'll definitely add it to my to try list for the next time, I dive down that dark whole.
It's still there actually. Although I think there's a few other users in that role now. https://i.imgur.com/wWAF5NG.jpg
Not that I know of. I don't know if the carriers would return the message if it wasn't one of their numbers. I suppose you could shotgun it and send to the same number on all the carriers you think it might be. Only one would be valid and go through. The others would either be dropped or returned.
Had this impression of him for years. In a way it's relieving to see my impression reinforced, however I feel bad for anyone that he perceived as crossing him.
lol I opened an issue last year asking them to slow down releasing because they were breaking things and got told to shove it.
I'm also interested in starting to learn Python to eventually make it into a career. I'm currently working desktop support and have been for about 8 years now and just looking for a change. Are there any desktop support skills that translate to working in this field?
Please keep working on it so it'll be ready for the 2020 campaigning.
Perhaps his uh.... unique style of tweeting is really just high-level opsec to prevent anyone from replacing him with an AI.

I have been working on a script to sort 'backups' of tv shows. It uses regex to find the files with names in a certain format, parses said filename for show title and season number and moves each file to the appropriate folder. &amp;#x200B; Link to check it out on my github:[https://github.com/BeardedIT/PythonScripts/blob/master/sort.py](https://github.com/BeardedIT/PythonScripts/blob/master/sort.py)
I think it was partly a case of chasing the new hotness (TOML as a compromise between obtuse JSON and overcomplicated YAML) and partly extending setup.cfg in ways not anticipated. setup.cfg is mainly a config dumping ground that was never intended to specify a project.
A slide with "urllib2 is toxic" as the only content, :eep:.
I think Brad Parscale and the Trump 2020 campaign have an opening for you!
There is also xlwings. Personally I find it a lot easier to use.
It doesn’t justify stealing 30k.
Thank you for repeating this, things like this need to be reiterated more often.
Note the “(upcoming)”. The 30k have gone. The sad thing is that stuff like this makes it harder for honest cash-strapped projects (which are the norm, in OSS) to fundraise.
Is it ready for use today? I was starting a new project and decided to try it out. Seemed to do the job. Coming from Ruby (which solved dependency tree locking a long time ago), I guess I feel like this is a must for enterprise level projects. Is there a better alternative for dep tree locking/resolution?
If there's another lesson here, it's to always donate via the Python Software Foundation. (or another foundation such as the DSF or NumFocus, depending on your stack... just so long as there are transparent financial reports and clear accountability)
Pipenv is usefulish when you want to pin dependencies for applications... but the real problem in packaging is library management not applications, so it's kind of like replacing CVS with Subversion when you need Git. (I don't think poetry is the solution yet because it can't deal with impure Python.)
If you have work with VBA then go with win32com. If you have zero knowledge VBA, then go with xlwings. Here is the link to the xlwings tutorial videos on YouTube. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3JVwFmb_BnTPmU9Vax-Q1u2CQ9QbFmiJ
Link to that issue?
Don't know much about the statsmods module but maybe consider a database output which can be read by tableau or powerbi. You can then export to csv or xlsx routinely (automatic) and still have xcel be useful for everyone but you get a nice database helping you out. I did it with postrgrql and its definately nicer than just getting xlsx output. Sorry this is only partially relevant. Happy coding
Is the code on Github? (or another public repository host?) If it’s just a script, I’m not sure if you could “deploy it;” I think someone would need to download it and run it, no? How does it work?
Jupyter notebooks are great! Enjoy!
I had advocated using Pipenv at work, until we hit way too many edge cases (“what do you mean, it takes half an hour to run `pipenv install`?”). We’ve since switched most things to poetry. My personal feeling is that it’s much more Unixy (do one thing; do it well) and far less surprising.
The selection of tools I have to work with is pretty limited. No datebase :(. But I agree with you. Probably might just do a csv output right now, and expand it, if people are interested.
Thank you, I will look at both.
My experience of both pipenv, and poetry led me to check out flit. There are huge differences in how each project gets where it's going, but flit has been much more reliable (if less user-friendly to configure).
nobody cares
That's impressive! How long have you been learning python?
There are lots of ways to do forecasting from time-series, so that’s its own can of worms. But if you consider the standard methods like ARIMA and other autoregressive models, the [statsmodel library](http://www.statsmodels.org/stable/tsa.html) is the place to start. You can read a simple tutorial [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/forecasting-exchange-rates-using-arima-in-python-f032f313fc56?gi=e3a9eeb561c8). But yeah, the tricky part is to know how to do the stats. Good luck.
GraphQL is mainly provided by Graphene. So, for the GraphQL part you can use any technique you're used to with Graphene, or any file structure recommended by them. You can also check out Ariadne, as it is ASGI, you can mount it directly into FastAPI: https://github.com/mirumee/ariadne
Is there a way to get the physical copies of these books through humble bundle?
Is there anyway to do something like VAR where will A impacts B, but B doesn't impact A?
My understanding (from talking to others who have used pipenv/pipfile) is that if your usecase matches the design usecase, out works very well. If your design doesn't match, using pipenv quickly becomes painful. Personally, I've used pip-tools for my personal projects, and it's worked well enough I haven't gone looking for something else.
Oh shit, we're in a catch-22 now though. We can't warn everyone else without triggering poor stefan here!
quality shitpost

I feel the tone of this blog post very much different from one by njs. njs had more details and was ensuring this to be a transparent one from his experience. But the reply has very less details and from the beginning has a little tone of vindication that he knew it was coming. I guess this could have been worded better and seems like a hasty one to original post also given that there is PyCon this weekend.
You could definitely describe them as lazy! Iterators are weirdly enough like coroutines - they can be paused and will only do as much work as you tell them to.
Can you upload the project on github?

Yeah I would say the results are on par to his tweets, good representation of him a couple years into the future.
Unrelated to the subject matter, but the author mentions that there is a lack of open source contributors in the Python community. I know a fair bit of Python and have been using it long enough for it to be idiomatic-ish. I've never contributed to open source before and I'm not sure where to begin. My question is, what kind of projects are open for newcomers to contribute on? What kind of a level should I be at to be able to contribute something meaningful?
He have had that tone against me too in several project when I have opened issues. I know that managing issues in open source projects can be a strain on time but I rather leave an issue open without an answer instead of closing it with a snarky and imprecise comment.
Oh fucking please Kenneth. I've abstained from commenting on the piece itself, as I am most definitely not Kenneth's fan. But if you're going to make another shitty journal post in response, it's time to break down your utter bullshit and remind everyone of the utter shit you've become. &gt; I appear to be the target of a personal character attack piece, that's been making it's rounds on social media today, expertly timed to ruin my weekend at PyCon US 2019. Hello paranoia. &gt; I got nothing but strange signals from njs since I first interacted with him, which is why I didn't answer his threatening-sounding emails. What was the threat I was perceving? That he'd do basically do exactly this. So outing you and your bullshit is threatening to you? That's a truly wonderful thing given the kind of asshole you are. &gt; We are not planning on directly using njs's urllib3 work, as it has proven to be a bad choice for us, moving forward. We are working on making a low-level http library built into requests3 itself, which will have many advantages. "Ha! Guess what, you're invalidated because we won't actually be using your work" This is worse because then it is clear you made it seem as though you would and he would be working on such a thing for a long time to end up being pointless. &gt; Until recently, when Tom Christie joined the team, I was the only person available to work on the advancement of "requests". Let's then look at the commit history! [For example, this spike](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/graphs/contributors?from=2017-03-27&amp;to=2017-06-25&amp;type=c) seems impressive. However, upon further inspection, it seems to be mainly removals. when looking at some the commits, [the same is shown](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/compare/2772413f3d7b0ac046257c6c67c684dda2f0903f...60226cc2). Many of these changes are inconsequential to the improvement of the software, but instead are fluff import name/style changes or [re]moving vendored packages. If you don't count these, [in the past five fucking years](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/graphs/contributors?from=2014-12-22&amp;to=2019-05-04&amp;type=c), user Lukasa is the primary contributor. I am more than sure that many more of Kenneth's changes have been fluff, but I don't have the time at 2 am to dissect his bullshit that intensely. &gt; I approached njs shortly after the fundraiser, and he was almost offended that I wanted to explore the possibility of reimbursing him for his urllib3 work, because he "had a job". How in the bloody hell is this an argument? "He seemed offended that I'd reimburse him, so then months later as time went by, I will not even consider that he may have changed his mind in this stance". Not to mention this is utter hearsay firstly, and secondly, I would argue that payment should be provided regardless of his offense. If truly offended, the check would not be cashed. &gt; Because of this, the fundraising funds were allocated to myself, to reimburse myself for all the time and energy I'm putting into Requests III, which I want to make a really great product. Oh fuck off you're a marketer trying to program. Or you have deviated so far off the proper path that you truly think you are making a large effort compared to the other contributors. This is the worst case of someone paying themselves I've seen, and I've seen many corrupt and shitty CEOs. &gt; All major sponsors (e.g. the sources of the money) are aware of who they were paying. All one-off donations that were made were made with a link that said "Pay Kenneth Reitz". There is no conspiracy here. Yes, but they may not be aware that they are paying *you* when *others* are doing the majority of the work. You are literally accepting payment for the labor of others in this case! &gt; Any future donations to Requests III efforts (if there are any), will be split between Tom &amp; myself. We were discussing the possibility of using PSF Fiscal Sponsorship for this component, but we're going to cross that bridge if/when it's needed. Cool. Make sure that that is known from the beginning, and then no one will make any large commitments to the project anymore. &gt; All that being said, I'm not sure why this person feels the need to attack my character, including curating a list of quotes (what?) from "collaborators". All I have to say about this section is hey, if you don't like me, don't fucking work with me. I don't have time for two-faced relationships. Because it is absolutely horrendous.

No, you are trying to make excuses for yourself, as you always will do. You are a disgrace to your past self and should be ashamed of the way you have dealt this this situation, with the pipenv one, and many more. You are not our Python lord and savior. Stop putting yourself on a pedestal, and I can only hope others will stop as well. Kenneth, from the bottom of my heart, "keep on keeping on", so that one day more and more people in this community can expose your utterly horrendous personality and character. This will undoubtedly be the first of many to come in those who speak out against you, unless you take a step back, look around you at what you've built and what you've become, and fucking apologize to everyone and be better moving forward.
I mostly works, I use it but there are problems in several areas. I made a couple of lengthier comments on one issue that touches with some of the core problems pipenv poses here: https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3702#issuecomment-487381432
Reitz is a great engineer but an engineer with a horrible attitude who cares about nothing but marketing and claims that his mental disorder is responsible for all of his faults.
So in other words, Kenneth Reitz?
I have no concept for how fucked this is.
Petty, guilty response. Damning to Reitz. A rational person would know this only hurts him, but well.
your import should have the format from &lt;file&gt; import &lt;class&gt; If you write import x python tries to import the *module* called x, so you could access every class of file x as x.class1, x.class2 etc.

That was a weird read.. Very defensive to an almost paranoid level. If he wanted to have a "1st response" out there, a simple "I've read Nathaniel's journal, and I will come with a response once PyCon is over and the dust have settled" would suffice? Anyway, my impression is that Nathaniel didn't attack Kenneth personally at any point and explicitly told readers to be chill, and not go out and harass him.
&gt; Anyway, my impression is that Nathaniel didn't attack Kenneth personally at any point and explicitly told readers to be chill, and not go out and harass him. Kenneth has a history of making everything personal. Including constructive criticism of pipenv.
&gt; what kind of projects are open for newcomers to contribute on? Pretty much all of them; they just tend to value different types of work, typically depending on size. Larger projects will appreciate you contributing minor bits and bobs to start with - docs, bug triage, very small pull requests with clear intent and tests, and so on. Smaller projects, with only one maintainer, are usually pretty grateful for all the help they can get. Just don’t come in like you own the place - look at open bugs and submit pull requests at first, don’t expect everyone to jump on them or grant you commit rights straight away. Just keep in mind that it’s about relationships as much as code, that everyone is busy, and that very very few actually get paid for this, so it’s a labor of love they might be jealous of. &gt; What kind of a level should I be at to be able to contribute something meaningful? Don’t worry about that, just be ready to accept honest criticism. Just pay attention: if a project has tests and you want to add a feature, make sure you write tests for it; if a project is well-documented, make sure you use plenty of formatted docstrings. Etc etc. Always start small and expect nothing, and you won’t be hurt or disappointed by being ignored or rejected. (Btw I find the claim of “not many contributors” a bit bizarre, to be honest. CPython is mostly run by volunteers, and same goes for most Python libraries out there. The ratio of users-to-contributors is definitely higher than other FOSS areas, but that’s because the ecosystem has exploded in a way that hasn’t really happened for, say, GNOME or KDE).

For the record, Kenneth has [posted a rebuttal](http://journal.kennethreitz.org/entry/conspiracy). &gt; I appear to be the target of a personal character attack piece, that's been making it's rounds on social media today, expertly timed to ruin my weekend at PyCon US 2019. &gt; I got nothing but strange signals from njs since I first interacted with him, which is why I didn't answer his threatening-sounding emails.

There is, but like with many psychological conditions, they’re not 100% effective. E.g. we had a good run, but after those 8 years she broke up during a manic phase. The manic phase was so much longer than any other before it that I didn’t think it was a manic phase at all and broke up internally as well. Then she wanted me back but it was over for my at that point. Pretty much every hardship in that relationship (and its end) can be attributed to bipolar, but that was never a reason to accept bullshit from her when she was manic. I had to stand my ground and it was hard. Mania means that people don’t think about what they say and there was quite some verbal abuse that I only endured because I knew it was the mania talking. It still hurt and I wouldn’t accept that kind of shit anywhere but as the partner of someone with a psychological condition. Certainly not by a colleague. PS: By now, everything is good and both of us are in new relationships.

Textbook narcissist. Brave to call him out, especially knowing that these type of people will do everything to hold up their reputation. So be prepared for his retaliation. And yes, emphasizing on positivism serves as means to protect against being called out on their highly unethical and vicious behaviour.
It may or may not be, but it's definitely not a thing you should be hyperoptimizing for. Just make sure your own code is efficient.
I'm getting married next month and I am new to python, but I have been trying to build a smart bartender with a raspberry pi 3 that will make me dinks by ordering from a tablet or from a built-in LCD screen and buttons.

There hasn't been a *single commit* to the codebase [(`requests/` folder in the repo) in 5 months](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/commits/master/requests) if I'm reading this correctly.
So, should we be still using pipenv? What are the better alternatives?
why so many down doots?
I pushed for Pipenv as well where I am, and yeah, the extremely slow builds are grating on people's nerves. Sounds like we should try out Poetry
Nope, sorry :/
Impossible to read the text font :/
I guess it's fine What's the problem ?
Just unreadable on my iphone.
That depend on your needs. I consider venv and pip to be much better at providing what pipenv promises, but that's a matter of personal taste.
Did you even try to search first? [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2632677/python-integer-incrementing-with](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2632677/python-integer-incrementing-with)
Try this https://dev.to/bhupesh/30-seconds-of-c-4egn I am actually working on the website
In some fairness, it's sometimes hard to use a bunch of symbols in a search. &gt; There isn't a `++` operator in python. You're applying unary `+` twice to the variable. *[in the former case]*
Super!
Please read the rules, this should be asked on /r/learnpython, and you should show an attempt and explain what specific issue you're facing. You'll want to explain what you mean by n input in single line
For future reference, you'll want to ask similar questions on /r/learnpython
I'm sorry I didn't knew that.N here defines number of elements user wants to insert.
Understandable, have a nice day.

Facebook's Prophet has had positive feedback. This tutorial may point you in the right direction: [https://shiring.github.io/forecasting/2017/06/13/retail\_forcasting\_part3](https://shiring.github.io/forecasting/2017/06/13/retail_forcasting_part3) You can find the tool here: [https://facebook.github.io/prophet/](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/)
The thing is, the impact of doing this will be absolutely minimal compared to your code. If your code is using too much CPU time, you need to profile and optimize, not do this.
What’s wrong with file extensions? Just like .py to the python interpreter like you link .txt to Notepad++ or anything besides Notepad.
`elements = [input("Input your input No. {0}: ".format(x+1)) for x in range(N)]` This should work
I am sorry but i didn't find a solution to my problem in the link you gave me... My problem was that ++b doesn't work as pre increment....but also it is not showing any syntax error... But in case of b++ it gives a syntax error... So why there is no syntax error for ++b
Ohhh yes... Thanks buddy... That didn't even strike my mind for once... Thanks for help
Yes sure... Thanks for the tip
Thanks
Just my two cents: On my instruction we used pipenv in a huge project last year. It worked fine but from time to time there were little issues that lead to some serious trouble in our developement process. We figured out a workaround but in the end I wanted to share my experience and I wrote a post with a title like "pipenv is not production-ready". Reith reached out to me and was not even close to being friendly. P.S.: Today I am using poetry in my daily work and I love it. It's working really smooth.
No it's just like taking normal input.I have to take input in single line i.e Elements = [list(map (int,input().split()))] Using above we can take as many inputs in a line but how to take a specific input in a line. Say user only wants to take 5 input and not more than that and in single line.
It's just regular-onset dementia.
The charitable reading would be that this is PyCon weekend and while njs probably had a bunch of time to think about and write it this one is on a shorter time scale. I hope there is a longer response sometime later.
pipenv claims to be recommended by pypa but if you follow the link to pypa frim their github page, there is no mention of pipenv at all. Also if you do a google site search on [pip.pypa.io](https://pip.pypa.io) there is no mention of pipenv at all . &amp;#x200B; I looked at pipenv once and used it for a bit but I got so used to pip+virtualenv and pipenv did not give me anything new for my use cases.
Are there any restrictions e.g. how to split the parameters? Otherwise, why don't you do `Elements = [list(map (int,input().split()))][:N]`? It should restrict to the first N elements.
in tutorials, under managing dependencies there is only tutorial for pipenv - https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/managing-dependencies/ may be I am not looking at things correctly, but these don't have tutorials for pip? as someone who comes searching for it, they will start using pipenv only no? if you google 'python manage dependencies', the first result links to the earlier pipenv tutorial I linked. the domain certification is from PSF, so it is kinda official Python org recommendation? thank you for taking time and replying
PyPA is a 3rd-party and not associated with PSF (I could be wrong, but if they are, their repos should be moved to python). Of course, they would recommend their own software. Anyway, `pipenv` is a good tool and I use it myself. No other dramas when creating virtual environments. I just don't like its locking feature. IT IS SLOW AND TAKES DECADES TO FINISH! I use it with `--skip-lock` flag,
I like (pyenv-virtualenv)[https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv] best in case you want to give it a shot.
Install twisted with pip install Twisted[windows_platform] before you install scrapy should do it.
&gt; PyPA is a 3rd-party and not associated with PSF I don;t think this is correct, I am not sure though. on pypa site - https://www.pypa.io/en/latest, PSF is mentioned in header the site https://packaging.python.org/ is a subdomain of python org
I will check that out, thank you is that a tool you recommend to a beginner?
Thanks for the link. I myself am not sure if it it is really official or not. I think if you are starting out and want to use it, by all means go and use it. For folks like me that have been using pip +\_ virtualenv will continue using them I guess. Something to read up though is: [https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/07/17/pipenv-promises-a-lot-delivers-very-little/](https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/07/17/pipenv-promises-a-lot-delivers-very-little/)
It matches my personal experience contributing/trying to contribute to Requests as well. It also explains a lot about the weirdness of how urllib3 people reacted to my interactions with Reitz, it didn't occur to me at the time that they knew and were working around him while trying not to rock the boat. I just walked away from the whole thing, very glad I did.
I had found that link earlier, however it is too advanced for a beginner user like me. I will try to read it again. &gt; For folks like me that have been using pip +_ virtualenv will continue using them I guess same here. I am a happy user of pip + virtualenv
&gt; I could be wrong, but if they are, their repos should be moved to python I said this above, you should complete the quote

Because it's valid syntax. Just like you can do -5 you can say +5 (which is redundant of course). If you do --5 you have double negation so you get just 5. Double ++ does not have effect so you can do even ++++++++++100 to get 100.
Yes i got it...thanks for help
Yeah much easier to read on this site and it looks really interesting.
Tom Christie from DRF has annonced this https://github.com/encode/requests-async
I think generally people think it’s OK - some people like it and some people don’t. But it’s real use case is developing applications, but it’s been sold as the be all end all for virtual environments. I’ve heard it’s not great for developing libraries.

&gt;requir**e**ments.txt &gt;pip3 install -r requirments.txt One of these things is not like the other.
Same experience. I’m a student and advocated for pipenv use in my office, as we’re all using python for machine|deep learning. Pipenv took so long to resolve dependencies and eventually broke when installing pytorch. We’ve gone back to conda and now everything just works as intended. Not heard of poetry yet though, I’ll check it out!
I've adopted `pipenv` recently and find it easier to manager my project's dependencies with it. That said, I almost avoided it after I saw Reitz's comments to some issues. I'll gladly hear suggestions for other packages (I don't need package-management, just managing dependencies).
genius
Is the appropriate response to someone misappropriating donations not a collective cry against that person? Could that not be construed as harassment by the community?
Interesting topic! I've used this library before, including other similar libraries too. But it becomes "cluttered" when you have several schedules. I made a library myself which was inspired by `doctest`: [https://blog.easyaspy.org/post/12/2019-05-01-crontab-based-scheduling-within-doctrings](https://blog.easyaspy.org/post/12/2019-05-01-crontab-based-scheduling-within-doctrings)
I appreciate Reitz's response but it was vague to the point of being like a PR piece. If you want to defend yourself you need to provide more evidence.
&gt; Essentially, the standard library is where a library goes to die. It is appropriate for a module to be included when active development is no longer necessary. Not a single mention of security at all, and certainly not enough to conclude that the Python devs would sit on security patches to conform to a release cycle.
Linus would be less of a target, since it's generally distributions that release kernels, and Guido has already stepped back from Python release management. Although the relevant people in RedHat, Canonical or the PSF would definitely be good targets.
Yes that happens. There is a way around it but I can't remember. I'll check and let you know. How are you progressing with your learning?
Read the slides
Exactly. Python will read from the socket as fast as the computer can. Most of the underlying IO is actually handled in C from what I understand. Now reading that data into whatever structures and processing it might slow you down a bit, or a lot!
This made me giggle
I think many of us missing the real point here - using a virtual environments is the goal and the way to go there is just the polishing of you as a developer and/or of your products.
Ah, I hadn't seen that (honestly thought it was a banner ad at first for some reason). Personally, I still don't think it's a valid reason (like I said, I don't believe the devs would hold off on releasing security patches), but I guess Reitz does. I'd note that there's no mention in the slides of what the Python dev team thinks, or how they'd respond to that implication.
The repo owner requested the transition. Are there popular packages you are aware of that would like to also transition? Note this means the original author and the contributing team lose control and the python organizational permissions are used for the project?
Remove them from friends. Look at your followings ... 20 minutes later you are done. Developing a process for doing something like this, once is just not something I would waste my time on.
I feel like I have a solid grasp of the basics. But I struggle with learning/ finding recources for more advanced stuff. Do you know anything that could help me out?
thanks for noticing that, its fixed now.
Are you testing with distributions or samples of those distributions? If samples, the Kalmagorov goodness of fit test which is in scipy.stats https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.kstest.html may be more appropriate.
&gt; Things I thought the bot would love talking about stuff like #MAGA, russia, china, collusion just generate garbage strings. Garbage in, garbage out
I think it is time we stop giving Reitz a platform. He's acted without considering the consequences for anyone but himself many times in the past, seems to be incapable of introspection, and shows no signs of changing. Kenneth, if you read this comment, please get out of the game for a couple of years. Go work on yourself, get therapy, spend some time volunteering in a soup kitchen. It's not too late to become a better person.
If your package is built with setuptools (if you're not sure, then it probably is), then you can create .exe entry points - see https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#automatic-script-creation
Turns out the part about the donate button saying "pay Kenneth" was untrue too.
You will not appreciate PyCharm until you used it's superb refactoring feature. I pretty much enjoy PyCharm and I am using it on all my projects. If you ever encountered "Clean Code" and been practicing it in your developer years, you certainly know PyCharm is a very good IDE. I would like to see how you code though. :)
Thanks, this is exactly what I was looking for! I use `setuptools` but use `twine` to release the package to PyPi.
If we look at recent responses to a CVE like [here](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/12755) the fix has yet to make it into 3.7 master after a couple months. Reitz says it was a discussion between him and core devs and then references the slides, implying the reasons he gives in the slides are the reasons they discussed. Maybe he's lying, who knows, but I don't think it's such a stretch.
While possible, breaking the current API to support async requests still feels like a bad idea that's probably very unlikely.
Thanks! Twitter Sentiment Analysis is working. That was online project #1. I now have it analyzing with 2 libraries and graphing the analysis. Next up is seeing if I can textually summarize the tweets. I'm multitasking with sequence prediction, but I'm really struggling with that one. I think I have a decent understanding of LSTM, but maybe there's a reason why I can't find sample code for what I'm trying to do.
what are the benefits of this vs something like argv or something? Isn't it designed for processing files?
Sounds more like a conman to me. His "minimizing the contributions of others" is also what has earned him the clout to pull in big donations - which he's apparently/supposedly abusing. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. He has done a lot for the python community. And we're getting rather "witch hunt" here...
You should get rid of the meme gifs
Very well put. It's true the project has grown immensely over a year, that could lead to stress to the maintainer for sure.
What ideal does he represent?
You want a CLI application like OP’s to act conveniently and expectedly. You want it to be able to handle all of those: $ # use files $ sarcasm file1.txt file2.txt ... $ # use stdin by typing it in $ sarcasm I’m typing this ^D I’m tYpInG ThIs $ use stdin from another command $ some-command | sarcasm ... $ # use stdin from another command interspersed with files $ some-command | sarcasm file1.txt - file2.txt ... The fileinput module allows all that.
I fed Trump speeches into a Markov chain and honestly, the results were pretty indistinguishable from the real thing.
What seems to be the problem?
Well i know how to simply append into a list but they want it in reverse . And when a sixth letter is added the first should be deleted from the list and so on .
See: [https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque)
This seems like a very interesting problem! I would advise you to first have a go at it for a few hours so that you can improve your problem solving abilities, come back when you absolutely cannot do it. The secret is in writing two loops
You know how to append to a list. Do you know how to iterate through a list? Do you know how to iterate through a subset of a list? If so, you have all the tools you need. &amp;#x200B; Also this is more a problem for /r/learnpython

Here you go ;) [https://github.com/storax/crib](https://github.com/storax/crib)
Thanks so much.
Stick to the intended purpose of the thread.
Simple APIs for humans. Separate the person from the art y'know.
Not the person you asked, but load testing comes to mind. I mean, the goal is high-concurrency, and you'll need good hardware to push it to its limits. And, you'll need to run those tests for a significant amount of time to hunt for memory leaks, rare race conditions, etc. Which could become costly on cloud servers. This is all besides the point. The bigger problem here, to me, is that he appears to be using the contributions of others to make himself appear more productive than he actually is, and using that image to milk open source funds. If it were, actually, him doing this work I wouldn't care what he did with the money. But it's not. So...
That's what I did for now. (use vanilla `venv` in py3) I don't have anything for different versions of the interpreter. Currently I pre-pended the newest version I have installed to PATH.
The best advice i got here was to try it myself. I gave up too early . I just did it myself and im happy . Thanks guys :)

Why should I use anything else than venv which is shipped with Python? Serious question.
It’s fine for creating a local development environment (and CI, I guess) based on a good setup.py, but the Pipfile and Pipfile.lock files belong in .gitignore in that case.
I've made a proposal on Python Ideas mailing list for a new interfaces implementation in Python and a working library which fully implements the proposal as a POC. Here it is https://github.com/lig/python-interfaces

Wow! That sounds impressive!! Doesn't sound like a beginner project. I recently started a course on data science. Just covered some basic numpy and pandas. Do you have your project on github?
