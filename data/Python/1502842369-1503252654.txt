A lot of the plugins for GIMP are written in python. Same goes for [blender](https://www.blender.org).
no its not written in python 
Thanks Sir. 
Thank You!!
Ahhhhh I was wondering why all of the stackoverflow posts I was reading were for mac/linux. This explains it all. I thought I was going to go crazy but you just leveled my head out lol. As for getting a cert, this is all homebrew level stuff so no employer provided ones. I did try packaging a google cert from my browser and putting that in place of my certifi .pem file but that did not work. I will try the virtualenv next and hope for the best. Thanks for the info and help! greatly appreciated.
You're probably on Windows, right? You can basically do that with basically anything on Linux :b. "sudo apt get install [program]".
I recommend that learn sql syntax of mysql (structured database) and mongo (unstructured database), just basic sql query is enough, then read documents of django model and try some example. More knowledge should be learned in practice.
yep

Couple things. I have a Django dashboard that I plopped on my Raspberry Pi. Uses a bunch of APIs (mostly messing around). I wrote a Django app a while ago that was supposed to connect to Battle.NET, Steam, Xbox, etc. and aggregate achievement information. I cancelled the project due to the fact that there are sites out there that do more in a probably better fashion. I'm working on integrating that site with my Pi dashboard. I have a Python script that generates and updates GnuCash files from the CSV files I get from my bank. Current problem I have is that I usually download the updated CSVs (not even attempting trying to automate my bank login) and then launch PyCharm to run my updater script. PyCharm takes a while to load and I just want to get the checkbook balanced. Working on adding a watchdog daemon that detects if I drop an updated CSV or save the GnuCash document that it will recalculate without me manually running it. Also will help keep my "remaining debts" spreadsheet constantly up to date in case I forget to run the script again. Also want to write a script using the PIL that I can point to a directory that has pictures of my daughter in it and makes a collage that spans my three monitors. It took me three hours to build the collage by hand, so updating it takes a while.
If you need help, send me a PM. Id be happy to help out.

The thing is you can do a lot of different things with python. You could write code to test chips at TI, create websites with Django, crunch number with numpy and the list goes on and on. I guess I would advise you to look at job postings for python programmers and see which ones interest you. Then you can specialize in a specific interest and learn modules that are applicable to it. Like I use python a bit at work. I'm a test engineer at a hardware company. So I write code with numpy and matplotlib to process raw data and plot it. If I was more interested in web development I'd immediately start putting all my downtime into learning Django. Just figure out what things you can do with Python that excite you and learn those things.

That's true, but sometimes you don't get the latest version (pandas for instance). If on Windows, try using Miniconda to manage your python and package installation.

PyCharm CE is excellent. Professional Edition implements some advantages like framework bootstrapping but in my case, with plain Flask as micro framework by default, I don't need anything not already included in the CE edition. Moreover, I use to disable some basic thing yet.... like the vcs, rst and other standard plugins.

&gt; Allowing true multi-core concurrency in CPython would lead knowledgeable developers to write far more efficient code than now. This is true but lets face if if highly efficient code was the goal Python is the wrong choice. In any event what I'm saying is that removing the GIL would change the flavor of Python and result in it being used in places where maybe it tis the wrong choice anyways. When I said Pythons greatness is was ease of use as a scripting language that is honestly how I see the language. If you sit down in front of a machine which would you choose Python or BASH? You can say the GIL has nothing to do with it but freeing up the language to do things that it wasn't designed to do is what removing the GIL is all about. I'm not convinced that it is a wise course of action.
Each new line adds n+1 more stars o the sum than the last. That is a very simple pattern. Get the input. Then you will need something to hold the answer, a sum variable, and a while loop that adds a number one higher than the last iteration and terminates once the total sum reaches the limit. I am not going to spoil the answer, because I think this is a learning exercise or something and I don't want to steal that from you. 
I think it's fair to say PIL is deprecated in favor of pillow or that pillow is the current, appropriate version of PIL that everyone should be using.
&gt; I think the more accurate comparison is the Visual Basic 6 to VB.NET which led to probably millions of people looking at their internal apps, and rather the port to VB.NET they rebuilt them as webapps. That amazing moment when Microsoft lost the API war. Interesting comparison but Python is still growing rapidly and most of that growth is via Python 3 code. &gt; Python 3.0 was a stillborn release and a big mistake that set a bad precedent - lots of people tried it out and found everything broken. The next few releases weren't much better. Not until 3.4 did we have a serious production quality release. Honestly I don't see this as a big deal, you need to refine a departure for the future and developer needs. You look at the development cycle for Apples Swift and you will see some rather dramatic changes, even mistakes made in design that have already come and gone as they stabilize the language. No one was forced to go Python 3 at stage one. &gt; It took until 3.5 for the core developers to notice people wanted to write source files than ran in 2 and 3 and add the proper changes to support this in the form of %-formatting for bytes and the Unicode literal prefix. I don't think the a coincidence that this was precisely when Py3 found its stride, and all of the major packages were off the wall of shame. While it might have taken Python 3 a bit longer to stabilize than one would have liked I really see the end results as being very pleasing. I'm not sure why any one would have expected perfection on day one of the first release of Python 3. You simply don't see such expectation with the development of other languages. &gt; Backward compatibility may be an entitlement but it's a rational one. This is perhaps the biggest problem it isn't a rational expectation. Python 2 had some really significant problems that would have resulted in the language eventually being phased out. Some of the changes made in Python 3 where have to do's for the language to survive into the future. &gt;I look at this way - the cost to the core developers to preserve compatibility is incremental - informally, O(1). The cost to the community to absorb compatibility breakage is analogous to O(N). That depends upon the community. You might have noticed that some applications, libraries and such, transitioned much faster than others. Not everyone found the transition to be the horror story many pretended it to be. I look at it this way I wouldn't have expected a complete transition in the first couple of years to Python 3. However we are many years from the first release now and frankly if someone hasn't transitioned in a decades time they have problem that are best resolved with a doctor who has a couch for a diagnostic tool. I mean seriously it has been almost a decade now.
Dan Bader is great!. I would second him.
Would this not be an indication of the wrong language being chosen? This may highlight the one thing that bothers me about the Python community, there are somethings Python simply isn't suitable for. It literally becomes a maintenance nightmare unless of course you have heat perfect test coverage.
 #current sum i = 0 #current line x = 0 limit = input('Limit: ') while int(limit) &gt; i: x = x + 1 i = x + i print(str(i)) else: print('end') This should work right?
Well it is going to a lot less painful going to Python 3 rather than say transitioning to Swift, Rust or Go, 5 years down the road when Python 2 support turns to crap! I'm not saying it is the easy thing to do, rather it is the smart thing to do if you expect to stay with Python into the future. If you don''t stay with Python your pain will be hundreds maybe thousands of times worse. Beyond the nothing is painless, just updating a C++ compiler can raise hell with ones code base but that doesn't mean you don't do it.
sentdex: https://pythonprogramming.net/
Almost. The only problem is that you exceed the limit occasionally, because your termination rule only checks if the current sum exceeds the limit not if the resulting sum will. Also I don't know why you have an else statement in there.

I'm a big fan of Python 3, to be clear. [I wrote about a painless porting experience](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/6o4tt0/time_to_port_small_flask_app_to_python_36_55/) and I maintain a Python 3-only open source project. I just think the devs mismanaged the early releases.
There's some relation but not 100%. But you have the right idea: mix and match ideas from all styles to fit the situation. 
Great concise article with code examples. Would like to see more of these for python modules!
CodeCov has always responded fast when I had issue (even as a free user). Coveralls was a pain in the A** several time, never responded to my emails, and a couple of time try to asked me for full permission on all my repos (including push and change admin !) locking me regularly in redirect loop. I went through the process of spending 2 days of converting all my repos from coveralls to codecov. Coveralls is still spamming me this month me on pull requests merged years ago. The CodeCov browser extension (https://github.com/codecov/browser-extension) is a must.
Shouldn't it if you use `/usr/bin/env`?
I'm working on a Django project to create an all-in-one property management solution. It's my first project, and everything has gone relatively smoothly. It aggregates multiple properties together so controlling the access codes of the doors, for example, becomes much easier. It's taken several months of research/testing/coding to get to this point and I'm pretty proud with how well I've been able to get everything done.
No, alias is just a shell feature.
Yeah, I've used Linux for a long time and know about apt-get, but I was doing this on Windows and had never heard of pip... nice to see
&gt; messed with conda's settings? No, never needed to bother. [the "create" syntax has changed](https://conda.io/docs/_downloads/conda-cheatsheet.pdf) On that current doco it says NOTE: Environments install by default into the envs directory in your conda directory. This is no longer true. The frustrating part is this: The current conda one installs TODAY and the one installed BEFORE, even updated - they don't seem to support identical syntax or they work differently. 
As someone a couple years into learning python as my first main language, I say focus on python. Python is easy and fun, but in truth, there are a huge number of implementation details and facts to remember about cpython as an implementation alone. Deep knowledge of a single language and runtime is, in my opinion, more productive than having a superficial diversity. Especially for finance, the conventional wisdom would be to focus on python. There is a lot of data-specific stuff that python is really well-suited for. Check out [XLWings](https://www.xlwings.org/), for example. Super useful, makes great use of a familiar environment via Excel, and facilitates all sorts of useful tasks. Using it is nowhere near as intensive as developing a full application, but you will have a lot of practical uses and motivations to use it right away. I must admit that I don't actually know much Java or its culture of developers, but it seems like the focus of java developers is typically application development. That's totally not the case with Python, per the above. And yet, it has tons of great application development frameworks that make it relatively easy. Lastly, I have a not-actually-valid, but---I think--relevant observation: When you install java, it changes your default search engine and installs yahoo search toolbar. Seriously. As if you can tell your users with a straight face that they should be searching using Yahoo search instead of Google. As if you can tell them the stupid toolbar installed by default is just a helpful addition to the browser, and not a misguided attempt of a failed search giant to obtain users of un-maintained systems; of the absolute lowest competency within the domain space of their own business! The python open source community has never given me that kind of experience once. 
This guy looks like Theon Greyjoy
We're already starting to do some stuff in Go, we may skip python 3 entirely at this rate.
Yeah the users I write for do tend to mind a lot about the terminal. If a program is filling it up with noisy warnings about library deprecations they might miss actually important stuff. So they often ask us to stop the warnings. So for me the plan of having 2.8+ pushing deprecation warnings and giving developers a clear path towards changes that would enable full 3.X compatibility would work great. That's basically what python 2.X did to prepare you for 2.7 I disagree that people would willfully stick with python 2 when a clear better alternative is available. I think that's what some of the passionate 3.X devs misunderstand is that this isn't about python 2.X people being deliberately stubborn. It's just them wanting to have a really smooth transition path because that's literally the only path they can afford. Putting a stop to feature development so that the entire team focuses only on a python 3.X rewrite is huge burden that scales with the size of the code base. Whereas given the alternative situation slipping in a python 3.x compatibility fix here and there as part of regular maintenance sounds pretty reasonable.
I think you should learn about SOAP! The clue simply is, that it should enable programming tools to offer an API that hides away the complete aspect of marshaling, transfering and unmarshalling the data! That's why there is a document called WSDL. With the information in it, a tool can *generate* the apropriate stub classes that offer a tailored API to communicate with a server that is also based upon that WSDL. You notice that is is totally independent from any programming language so far! Only the tools must support a specific language of course. That said, there is no need to craft the xml based soap messages by hand! If you do that, the whole purpose of SOAP becomes obsolete. In fact many devs do it that way - which is a terrible and poorly approach to deal with a SOAP webservice. But: SOAP is a *beast*! Imho it completely misses its own goals in reality. In order to save devs from manually do marshaling and remote transfer of data, it imposes complex specifications on them. The complexity forces one to rely on tools - which might not be existend for many languages. Especially in python SOAP has never become a big thing (compared to Java and C#), even in the late 2000, the *golden age* of SOAP. So I would say: Python isn't the right language for SOAP. (And SOAP isn't the right approach for b2b either 😈) Good luck anyways!

its okay for learning. A fast approach to gain real time experience of use of Python is to using it for automation and administration. How much can anyone learn quickly and implement to production is the key in the present time.
I liked 'Write on Image' part, for meme's I used to rely on online tools. Your post showed me new and innovative way of exploring python. Thank you.

Thank you very much for your answer. I've noticed I lack knowledge in that specific topic. Well, we are forced to use SOAP because of the other company. There is probably no other way to do it, right?
&gt; This is true but lets face if if highly efficient code was the goal Python is the wrong choice. Efficiency is desirable in all projects. You should not inhibit that goal just because _you_ feel the language can't be more efficient. Take say, highly scalable web applications where you want to service many requests per second for example. You could take your argument that you should not use Python, or any scripting language, but rather write it in assembly language because if you want performance, you shouldn't use anything other than assembly right? Wrong. Python is great for web apps (and many things) precisely due to its easiness, and at the moment the common way to get concurrency on the same machine without throwing more cash at scaling horizontally or vertically is to launch more Python processes, one per core. However, it's not easy to share information between these two or more processes without introducing some IO/IPC bottleneck. Whereas with threads and no GIL, you'd just need to perform a single context switch. That overhead has then been eliminated (granted web apps typically do more IO e.g. waiting for a database response, but you get my point).
How on earth does one on automate a network 
Of course you can just parese / handcraft the SOAP messages *by hand*, thus with a XML parser like ``lxml`` and do the communication via an http lib like ``Requests``. Just be aware that you must be very carefully regarding the *defined* format by the WSDL. I don't know how complex the communication is and how *stable* the format is. The less complex the better for such an approach. But I have no experience with the tools mentioned by other users. Perhaps they are fitting? I would definitly give specialized tools a try *before* making a step back and handcraft everything by hand.
Open source project: JIRAlice - JIRA tickets created from PagerDuty alerts via Chalice. Tried to make it painless to setup (Thanks Chalice). https://github.com/sbraverman/jiralice
was this article written by a crappy markov chain? It makes little sense and has tons of mistakes. &gt; Syntax of PHP is identical to C. What? &gt; While in Python, developers no need to use lots of curly braces as it is already a highly readable language from the beginning. ??? &gt; When comes to garbage collection, PHP beats Python in this category. PHP supports garbage collections such as built-in gc_enable function. But Python supports cycle-detecting garbage collector, while effectuates memory management. ?!?!? &gt; Apart from these syntax, readable code most of the developers use PHP as their functional language for its security, frameworks and CMS. PHP is apparently known for its security.
Could you format your code a bit better?
I see. I had hope.
Better yet make it valid Python. For starters the colons are conspicious by their absence :-(
I stopped reading at the first Code example. An empty set of parentheses does not create a tuple--a comma is required. Edit: whoops! That's only for a one-tuple. Thanks for the corrections! 
Exactly what I thought and I was wrong, it does. &gt;&gt;&gt; t = () &gt;&gt;&gt; t () &gt;&gt;&gt; type(t) &lt;class 'tuple'&gt;
Just use max() on the list. l = [ 9000, 64738, 0, -273 ] print('max value: {}'.format(max(l))
To post code start a line with four spaces. The easiest way is just to use an editor like Geany (my suggestion) or Sublime Text that allows you to easily indent multiple lines, add one level of indentation for your code, then paste here. List1=[] largest =0 if sourceAddress =="10.10.33.18": var=str(TOS) print(' tos{0}'.format(var)) if (val&gt; largest): largest = val print('max value {0}'.format(largest)) First issue is basic python syntax. You need consistent indentation, no capitals in `if`, and colons following conditionals, like above. Also `=` in the conditional should be `==`. Although it's still not working code because you're not assigning your variables, like `sourceAddress` or `val`. If this is just a snippet you need to include the rest, at least what's relevant. There's a built in function for this: `max(list1)`. This returns whatever the greatest value is. If you can't use `max()`, you would have to iterate through the list, checking each item, so that once you get to the end you can know which is highest by comparing as you go. If your list is `l`, max = 0 for i in l: if i &gt; max: i = max print(max) 
I only read the first few paragraphs of that article, but the grammar is so bad I find it clear that little to no effort was put into it.

You're thinking of a 1-tuple. A 0-tuple is the only tuple which does not require a comma.
Just read all official documents which is exhaustive enough.
Because you select different random choices. One which you print out. And multiple ones for the condiditions. They all are new random! You must save one random choice to print AND run your conditions again. like: program_choice = random.choice(choices) if player_choice == 1: print(program_choice) if program_choice == "....": print .... so you store your random choice and then check with player and yourt choice not everytime a new random

I like the second one
Thank you
You should reformat your code you have at least one missing colon and so on. Back to the question: largest value? This is an ip address: "10.10.33.18" declared as a string not an integer. Whats the point? if something == something_else: print("something equals something_else") You need to use DOUBLE equal sign for equality and a colon in the end.
Python is my preferred language. Not having to remember if i have put enough { brackets or missed a ; is nice. It also ensures that indentation is logical or your program wont work.

Get your code working and then integrate. Especially if you're not familiar with those packages. The frustration with Django/Flask alongside frustration of debugging your scientific model code can be monumental at times.
hi every1 im new!!!!!!! holds up spork my name is katy but u can call me /u/TheMoroccan_BadLogin !!!!!!!! lol…as u can see im very random!!!! thats why i came here, 2 meet random ppl like me _… im 13 years old (im mature 4 my age tho!!) i like 2 watch invader zim w/ my girlfreind (im bi if u dont like it deal w/it) its our favorite tv show!!! bcuz its SOOOO random!!!! shes random 2 of course but i want 2 meet more random ppl =) like they say the more the merrier!!!! lol…neways i hope 2 make alot of freinds here so give me lots of commentses!!!! DOOOOOMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! &lt;--- me bein random again _^ hehe…toodles!!!!! love and waffles, /u/TheMoroccan_BadLogin 
I don't see the evidence that I asked for, would you please be kind enough to try again. 0 / 10, must try harder.
Really good one ! To get only the Python related stuff: http://sametmax.com/tag/python/
That's certainly a possibility. :p 
For what it is worth, I just updated conda to 4.3.24 (the latest release) and I see no change in how environments are created. Also, I quickly skimmed the [changelog](https://github.com/conda/conda/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and I don't see anything which would result in the behavior you're seeing. Good luck!

&gt; Sanic's gotta go fast What is this meant to mean? It does not explain why flask is `old and broken`. Sanic is also less than useless to a lot of people as it's Python 3.5+ only.
I've never really branched out of what comes in the box with python threading and running ASync tasks. Looks interesting :) 
Nice one mate, I'll stick to those instead of looking for a magic bullet sort of tutorial.
&gt; The Fibonacci Sequence is a very common sequence in Math, Computer Science, Engineering, etc. Also nature. I believe that the nature aspect was what interested a gentleman by the name of Alan Turing. You may have heard of him.
Asks seems the simpler http async library on the pitch. I always struggled with asyncio/aiohttp
Yeah, because someone's bad writing must imply they are female, or young, sure. Because of course, everyone must be a native English speaker, right? It's not because a post does not comply with the subreddit policy or with the standard netiquette that it's ok to shame the OP for being new or female or whatever. The adult thing to do here is, just like /u/Caos2 did, to point them to the right subreddit.
nice module (perfect for teaching). maybe a bogo-sort implementation would be a funny addition ;P side note: I see some of your classes (like tree nodes) have getter and setter methods. in 99% of cases this is unnecessary, all member variables are public. I would sugest using a namedtuple for node (since it essentialy generates a class that does a couple of things that makes them "nicer" to work with). but that's just my five cents.
I learned something today. Great video! Keep it up
/r/learnpython is **much** more appropriate. Also, if you indent your code with four spaces, it will format: import random print(" START GAME") print("choise from 1.rock | 2. paper | 3.scisors") choices = ["rock", "paper", "scisors"] player_choice = int(input(" ")) if player_choice == 1: print(random.choice(choices)) if random.choice(choices) == "scisors": print("you win") elif random.choice(choices) == "rock": print(" tie ") else: print("you lose")
Agreed, take a look at this talk for more great tips on getting away from the "Java"-style you're using here: https://youtu.be/OSGv2VnC0go
Sorry... The discussion part is quite important to me, it may be TL;DR or you dont have time/willingness to jump into it, but as I see it, there are people on stack overflow that have excuse in form of "this is/not pythonic". I would like to discuss with Reddit what is general opinion about what is pythonic , does it have correlation to zen of python, are PEPs strict rule to follow or some guide lines - in general correlation of those 3 things. I agree with you on every point so far, but elaboration and clarification would be helpful. If there are some common ideologies between pythonic and zen of py, do you have some examples? In short: I am interested in your opinion, as a whole, not just a few sentences. Sing me a song of your people ;P
Go to your installation directory and run the application in `cmd`. For example for me cd C:\Program Files (x86)\QMLApplication Python\python.exe QMLApplication.launch.pyw 
So do you follow PEP like Bible/Quran/Torah and etc ? Or perhaps you use it as guide lines, and if you follow PEP ... why ?

Just my two cents in web data scraping: when a web page is loaded by JavaScript, use QT 5 render to fetch the full page instead of using Urllib.
Thanks
I understand but I think there are many things Python developers agree are unpythonic, but what is actually pythonic is something very subjective and people will disagree. It's a matter of taste. I think some code Guido writes is unpythonic which is pretty absurd if you think about it for even a second.
&gt; I am looking for recommendations on python books. The ultimate goal is to convert existing C# programs, that are integrated with matlab and DLLs, into python and replace C# all together. Sounds like you might get some mileage out of *Python for Data Analysis* by Wes McKinney.
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython. We **highly encourage** you to re-submit your post over on there. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community is actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers. If you have a question to do with homework or an assignment of any kind, please make sure to read their sidebar rules **before** submitting your post. If you have any questions or doubts, feel free to reply or send a modmail to us with your concerns. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
I've been working on learning tkinter to make GUIs to incorporate some of my text based programs in python to be easier to use. 
your first and second example show syntax of different features first [elem for elem in iterator if condition] is a part of list comprehension, there's no else second is just ternary operator which works like: variable = some_value if condition else other_value which then can be placed in a list comprehension &gt; Could you help me understand why if/else/if doesn't work in a list comprehension? because it would be ureadable? If you have some serious logic to work around each element of your list then maybe put it in a function and apply it to elements: def my_filter(elem): if something: ... elif something_else: ... else: ... [my_filter(x) for x in mylist] 
Ok, so you're saying that using *idiomatic numpi* is a possible solution for these memory inefficiencies. This is good to know for computational related projects. I'm still at a loss for what techniques should be used for projects not focused on compute, e.g. web services (which in reality I go to node.js for such things).
You are right that the Flask docs used to say ["recommend sticking to [2.x] Python"](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/python3/) in 0.10.x (June 2013). This recommendation was [repeated](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/3f3gdw/python_2_or_3_best_for_flask/ctmp4ad/) by /u/mitsuhiko (the original author of Flask) in July 2015. However, since then the docs have changed to ["you should be fine with Python 3"](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/python3/) in 0.11.x (May 2016) and to ["You should start using Python 3"](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/python3/) in 0.12.x (December 2016).

Whenever i get the build folder it ends up with "Program name"&gt;"Python" In "Program name" there is ProgramName.launch.pyw python.exe is in the "Python" folder so the CMD you gave won't work because they aren't in the same directory.
Python 3.5+ only keeps the riffraff out

Really excited about this framework. The built-in request schema validation is sweet, and first-class support for dependency injection into views is something I've been looking for a long time in Python. And best of all, no idiotic globals like Flask or Bottle (seriously, what the fuck were they thinking?)
This is the error that i recieve: Traceback (most recent call last): File "LoLDataComp.launch.pyw", line 30, in &lt;module&gt; from LoLDataComp import main File "pkgs\LoLDataComp.py", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; import requests File "pkgs\requests\__init__.py", line 43, in &lt;module&gt; import urllib3 ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'urllib3' Also thank you very much for you help.
&gt;I understand but I think there are many things Python developers agree are unpythonic Yeah, and then comes the question of credibility. Myself, for one, i don't have any, so my voice should be heard in general, but taken with a grain of salt and further research. But knowing the credibility of user can be estimated by popular vote (which can be just popularity ) or frequency of adequate answers for which person will be forced to "stalk" in sort of manner, checking user profile which most of users don't do and it can be thedious task. &gt;what is actually pythonic is something very subjective Does it not seem a bit like "asking for trouble" since if "what is pythonic" question comes to task everyone will have its own definition and overall definition ( if it ever comes to actually defining it ) will be arithmetic middle that will be in result so watered down. &gt;I think some code Guido writes is unpythonic which is pretty absurd if you think about it for even a second. Guido ? O.o Do you think that there is a need for "pythonic way "? 
Agreed. The CTO should be focused on strategic and tactical objectives, not getting mired down into the minutia of operations. I actually like and use VS Code, but that's not the point.
Learning about concurrency in python. Some very interesting stuff
Quick tip, if you are a student you can get it for free with your student mail account.
You can see the changelog here: https://github.com/encode/apistar#02-release (same page, but far down the page).
I have the pycharm community edition. What are the advantages of an upgrade?
Database integration, profiler
The if at the end is a filter. The if to the left is just the result.
Like /u/badhoum said, you are confusing two different features. l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] [2*x for x in l if x &gt; 3] # Output: [8, 10] There are three parts to a list comprehension. First is the output expression (**2\*x** in the above example), then the loop criteria (**for x in l**) and finally the (optional) filter condition (**if x &gt; 3**). Lets start with the filter condition. This condition specifies whether the input should even be considered for processing. If the condition is false, the input is thrown away and processing moves on to the next item in the loop. In the example above, the input list had five items, but the output list has only two items. This is because three items failed the filter condition. It is important to understand that the filter condition does not determine the value of the output item, just whether the input item should be processed or not. When x = 1 or 2 or 3 the filter condition will fail and no processing will occur. Once an item is selected for processing (because it passed the filter condition, or there was no filter condition) then the output expression is evaluated for that item to calculate the output value. In this case, we apply 2\*x to the input. When x is 4, then the output will be 2\*4 = 8 and next time around it will be 2\*5 = 10. Note that the output expression must be an expression, meaning it has to return a value. So for example, you cannot use **pass** in there, because pass is a statement, not an expression. pass doesn't return anything, so python doesn't know what it should put in the output list for that input. So that is an error. Now, a regular *if* condition is also a statement and cannot be used here. However, there is a special form of the type *value if condition else other_value* which is an expression. This expression will return *value* if the condition is true otherwise it will return *other_value* (both value and other_value in turn must be expressions). Since it returns a value, it is an expression and can be used in the output expression part of a list comprehension. [2*x if x &gt; 3 else 3*x for x in l] # Output: [3, 6, 9, 8, 10] In this example, the output contains five items, just like the input. This is because there is no filter condition. Unlike the filter condition, the expression in the output expression part is used just to calculate the output item value, and not to prevent processing of any items. Now coming to your question: What if you want to do x\*10 if x &lt; 3 else x\*2 if x &gt; 3. First question to ask is: what will happen if x is exactly equal to 3? Remember that an expression should return a value for all inputs. If there is an input for which there is no output specified then it is not an expression. Let's assume for now that we want to return None if x == 3. Here is the syntax of an "if expression" again: *value if condition else other_value* where value and other_value are expressions. Well, x\*10 is an expression so we can write x\*10 if x &lt; 3 else other_value. What do we put for other_value? Remember that an "if expression" is itself an expression, so something like x\*2 if x &gt; 3 else None can be used as the other_value expression. So our full expression becomes: x\*10 if x &lt; 3 else x\*2 if x &gt; 3 else None. The list comprehension is then: [x*10 if x &lt; 3 else x*2 if x &gt; 3 else None for x in l] # Output: [10, 20, None, 8, 10] Now, in practice it is a good idea to not make the value expression or filter condition too complex because the list comprehension wouldn't be readable. In such cases, create a separate function and call that function the way /u/badhoum has suggested and call it from your list comprehension.
Thanks. Would definitely work on them!
Thanks for the link.
Would be even nicer with decorators and pytest probably but this is a good article in general. 
Post to /r/learnpython until you can at least write code without syntax errors. 
Yes. The difference is huge. And why are you asking here? If the CTO can't ask the devs himself that's super weird and you should get out of there. Also the CTO shouldn't be involved like that, that's weird. 
Thanks dude 
This taught me something, thanks for posting, keep it up!
Checkout this [comparisson table](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/editions_comparison_matrix.html) 
I thoroughly enjoyed reading this as someone who has dabbled in concurrency but doesn’t really rely on it. With that said, I have a comment: They talk of an example that causes a dead-lock. Namely having two locks. But, they never actually show you an example like that. It would be great if they actually write a program that will deadlock if your run it. And a question: Other than thinking about it really hard and trying to be on top of your game, is there a good way to test for a dead-locking edge case? It is probably not a stretch to think of a situation where deadlocking *can* happen but usually won't. Is there a way to set poor execution conditions that may elicit the behavior?
Each package you include you need to also list all dependencies. Do you have urllib3 in your installer.cfg? 
Any links, for the curious? 
It's a small firm and I am one of the developers that works closely with the CTO...would you please give me a few things that you found different between them?
* What political views was this moderator trying to "push", and in what ways was he pushing them? * Where did you "report" the moderator's actions, and what did your report say? Does the site give you an opportunity to privately appeal a moderator's decision to any kind of leadership team, and did you go through any such process before you challenged the moderator publicly?
I do not have urlib3 in my installer.cfg: [Application] name=LoLDataComp version=1.0 entry_point=LoLDataComp:main [Python] version=3.6.1 bitness=64 [Include] packages = requests sqlite3 os time files = README.txt
Under packages you need to list all dependencies of requests. Also `sqlite3`, `os`, and `time` are in the Python standard library and do not need to be included there.
How would dash work if there are several users? For example let's say you have a database and want to show a different plot to a different user. How does this get integrated with flask?
Visual Studio Code is a little editor with some features. PyCharm is just miles ahead. Even the free version is way ahead. PyCharm catches bugs as you type. 
and here I am having bought pycharm within the last month at full price :o
the issue is that i do not import urlib3 or use it in any of my programs to my knowledge.
Thanks for sharing. 
Not to sound too much like a douche, but using syntax that require documentation to understand it, is probably not worth it. List comprehension is great for small stuff but hideous for complex stuff like this. 
It is a dependency of requests. You need to include all of the dependencies for the packages you do use. See this thread for more info https://github.com/takluyver/pynsist/issues/123#issuecomment-322269903 
Contact their support staff, pretty good chance they'll give you a rebate.
I use conda on a daily basis. If something has fundamentally changed as you say, that would be troublesome for some instructions I have written for coworkers and colleagues. I will create a new user with a fresh conda installation on my OS X machine and report back if I can replicate the findings. Edit: On a fresh install of Miniconda with python3.6 on OS X.11.6 El Capitan, I see no difference in the way conda handles environments. I did a fresh install of miniconda answering yes to all questions in the bash installer when prompted. I then executed: conda create -n TestEnv python=3.6 numpy and the installer proceeded as per usual. conda env list outputs /Users/testuser/miniconda/envs/TestEnv and /Users/testuser/miniconda3 I am not sure about any of the other 20 odd commands listed in that "Cheat sheet" you posted as I don't tend to use them. However, the command I use to create new envs works exactly the same as always. You can execute that command from any location but conda places the env in the /envs/ subdirectory of your conda installation folder. **TL;DR:  I am not able to replicate any new or "odd" behavior with the way conda creates virtual environments using the latest version of Miniconda on OS X.11.6.**
Learn something GUI based. Learn how to do event driven GUI apps. You could go with PyQt (love it, license annoys me slightly :( ), PyGTK (Good but doesn't have very good tutorials), or Kivy (if you can get the bloody thing going. On Windows it should be fine). That's what I recommend anyway, always useful to be able to do that sort of thing. 
And what would I make? Got any PyQt tutorials that are good and not PyQt4?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBME1ZyHiP8 Follow that through and then you might think of something. I'm really bad at ideas. 
That is PyQt4 :P
Thanks for watching!
Glad you found it informative :)
also docker integration and remote debugger
Looks great! Thanks so much for taking the time to provide help to an issue that a lot of people have trouble getting to grips with.
I think so? There were a few issues in the Whoosh tracker around Py3 compatibility ~2 years ago. But, I believe they've all been fixed. Even then those only had to do with Async indexing. You shouldn't run into any major problems as far as I know.
Again You comment makes zero sense! I might not be perfect at English, but that isn't my problem, I didn't come here to learn English for god's sake have some respect not everyone is born in London, and not everyone is Shakespeare Keep spreading your stupidity, it really helps Thank you!
Thank You, I ll make sure this won't happen again xo
Appreciate your comment!
This is an over simplification of logging in a library. The only REAL thing you should not do is use `logging.basicConfig` because it hijacks the root logger and won't allow the top application to define logging handlers at all.
Done, thank you! 
Is there instructions on the website as to how to get that? Thanks for the heads up. 
thx
It's important to note that this discount applies only to the new license. Code won't work if you're renewing subscription.
Personally i treat them as guidelines to make sure that everyone is coding in a similar way. I tend to concentrate my code style on my target audience, if it is for a fellow coder then i will leave it pretty sparse, if it will be read by a novice then i try to be really explicit. Stuff such as line length etc i ignore completely, I prefer the code to look neat instead of fitting in an archaic window width limit.
I've gotten py2exe to do it. You just have to set the `bundle_files` option to `1` in your `setup.py`. I believe PyInstaller can do the same thing by using the `--onefile` flag. 
They're very close and the first tutorial has a link to updated code. 
Django Integration
Thanks for checking. This is on **Windows** [here](https://paste.ubuntu.com/25327873/) shows what happens (in windows cmd) 32 shows the current envs 38 create fails 46 different create syntax works, but env ends up in pwd 57 does not show the new env even thou it is activatable. 
I ended up using loops but I wanted to understand the syntax nonetheless.

Does this discount apply indefinitely? (Do subsequent years with lower annual prices also adjust by 30%)
Thanks! Yeah, that's why I decided to do the tutorial. I wanted to get a deeper understanding of Threads, so I can break it down easily. 
alright this solved that issue and i realize that was my fault for not following instructions exactly. Thank you. My current issue now is: import _tkinter # if this fails your python may not be configured for TK Import error: DLL load failed: %1 is not a valid win32 application I am using python 3.6.2 and it comes packaged with tkinter to my knowledge. EDIT: this may be my solution https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/5uvlu9/tkinter_could_not_be_found_when_running_project/ EDIT2: still getting same error EDIT3: dammit i might have python3.6.2 32bit instead of 64 EDIT4: alright now it says Tcl wasn't properly installed. 
Does that work if you are not in a computer/IT course?
Too bad
You just need a .edu email
Awesome, thanks! 
I know a bunion named mb 
The space between the function name and the inputs normal? Or I'm being picky? 
Haha. Not the norm. I was so focused on the material, I guess I must have missed it. Thanks for pointing it out. 
I just finished the first one, really well spent 10 minutes =) going for the second one. 
nice
Thanks!
I finished a program that monitors website for any changes and gives you push notifications to your Android smartphone / iPhone using Pushover when a website changes. I do that by downloading the website at regular intervals, using Beautiful Soup to extract text from the HTML files and then I compare md5 hashes to see if anything has changed 
I've got a _studentnumber_@student._university_.com and it also works, most university emails work.
Contribute to an open source project
I've had problems with pip install on my Rasp Pi using python 2.7, but no errors doing anything with pip on 3.4. Have you tried switching? Or does the project require 2.7 / too far committed into 2.7?
Always good to see talks on unit testing, but just curious... why teach people `unittest` at this point instead of something more reasonable like `py.test`?
Thanks. I hope everything is understandable. 
&gt;I tend to concentrate my code style on my target audience. Could you elaborate it a bit more , since in my mind when you distribute module , target is user? &gt;Stuff such as line length etc i ignore completely, I prefer the code to look neat instead of fitting in an archaic window width limit. I personally work with npp with npp_exec plugin and custom exec scripts, so I will code it in such way that I can read it at a glance, and that it works. So I understand when you say that you don't care about width of line. But when you say neat... Do you mean logical or aesthetic ?
Full integration with various frameworks like Django, flask etc. If you try building a Django app in the CE version it's a bit painful.
I'm going to do a video on pytest soon so people can see the differences and why many prefer it over unittest. I mainly made a unittest video just because I've worked on several teams that still use unittest and assume this could be the case with other teams as well. But yes, I agree... I'll be doing a pytest video in the near future showing the benefits of a switch. 
it would be great but I don't think it would. just in case I contacted sales support
I'm a data scientist at one of the larger ecommerce sites in the US. It appears you're coming from a data analysis background in which the thinking is: 'what analysis can I produce that will best enable the business to make decisions?' The key part of this is the person making the decision is a person. Data science extends a bit further beyond the analysis and additionally asks: 'how can I best turn this into a data product?' In this case a data product will be an automated system that (often) employs machine learning to make decisions. I'll give you an example: I work on the marketing team. Whenever you visit the site, a cookie is placed in your browser which allows me to serve you personalized ads based on what you viewed on site. These ads are sold in second price auctions that occur in real time, in which you have ~50ms to submit a bid. The submission of the bid is maintained by the engineering team. But in addition to submitting the bid, we need to know: what is an appropriate bid to submit? That's where I come in, I build python scripts that sit within the engineering framework and evaluate what an appropriate bid would be for a given user based on their recent onsite behavior e.g. a person who has added a product to their cart versus one who has not has demonstrated a greater intention to purchase, and so we should be willing to pay more to show them an ad. So indeed my python scripts are pushed to production and are key in optimizing our marketing budget.
i've done this before with pyinstaller on 2.7.12 with {pyInstallation}/Scripts being on the PATH pyinstaller scriptname.py --onefile When you tried did you get any errors?
I can't speak for bottle, but Armin has expressed the reasoning behind the thread globals in Flask, it essentially boils down to that Django is doing it behind the scenes and hiding it from you how else would it know when to open and close database connections. Other frameworks do it too. It's not as idiotic as you make it out to be. Edit: removed an errant she, not sure how that got there. 
I did too, but it's a great program and worth the full price. I only regret waiting as long as I did to pull the trigger.
I haven't used Django, but I have had no issues using Flask in PyCharm. What benefits does the professional edition provide there?
Second pyinstaller. I've used this before quite successfully for Windows PE binaries. Simple and the resulting binary ran without issues.

Hey thanks for this. I was actually looking for a good tutorial for this the other day. 
So python in essence focuses more on automation than it does producing some graph, or other visual aid to be used in a business report? I guess I might be coming at it all wrong. Excel fits into a report. You print out the pretty graphs, and model the data. But you're talking about automating the marketing effort to countless users. Am I understanding correctly? 
hey thanks for the followup. still a pretty good deal for a great application.
You are indeed understanding correctly! Often the boundary between what is appropriate for python versus excel is blurry - in general it's worth coding if it's a process that is going to be repeated many times. For example, to track the performance of our online advertising effort, I have a different python script which is linked to an excel macro. I provide the excel sheet with the macro appearing as a button for the business stakeholders to press. Literally all they have to do is enter the date range desired into excel and press the macro button and my python script will take those date ranges, query our database, and autofill an excel sheet full of equations. Before this was a report I would have to compile weekly and took ~45 minutes, now it takes 0 effort from me. 
That is literally crazy. Seems like with python the possibilities are endless. However, programming isn't my strong suit, so I doubt I can make a career out of Python programming. Really I'm just building up a skill because it says it's required on mini job postings that I'm interested in, like data analyst, Business analyst, etc. some positions ask for a basic understanding of python. All on its own isn't hard because python reads just like a normal language. 
You can totally make it your strong suit! I only took two semesters of programming in college and otherwise taught myself on the fly. In my opinion, the trick isn't to take online classes but to just pick a project (start simple) and do all the googling necessary to get you there. Even as a data analyst there are so many opportunities for automation, and while that may not be a part of your job description, you'll be far ahead of the curve if you take the initiative! 
Well I still have a year of college left, so I plan to learn as much as I can about python on my spare time. I think it's the best programming language so far. I don't really do well working with R. I can pick up python so damn easily. It just sort of clicks and make sense for me. It really does. But when I get into R... R is insane to me. Like Chinese basically. So I do want to learn more automation, definitely. It's just about patience
Or if you know a student....
/u/badhoum and /u/Siddhi had great answers, reading theirs made me think of this solution: [x*10 if x &lt; 3 else x*2 for x in mylist if x &lt; 3 or x &gt; 3] The if clause on the right (the filter) ensures that there won't be any x=3 passed to the left if clause (the ternary operator). Then the left if clause determines the output. This combines the two different features the others mentioned: the filter of a list comprehension and the python ternary operator.
You are welcome. Hopefully you find it useful. 
The primary benefit I see in Hy is that it's a pretty friendly introduction to Lisp, and a pretty great way to get used to thinking functionally. Sure, you'll have to learn some new function names and some syntax differences if you move to a (bear with me) "real" Lisp, less so if you go to Clojure as Hy takes a lot from it. But honestly, that doesn't really strike me as much of a problem if you're comfortable with the rest of it. I probably wouldn't use it in production, but I'd love to use it for my pet projects. I just don't write a whole lot of Python these days.
Personally, I'd like to have long-form stuff like this also available in HTML form, where I'd be able to skim over the parts I already know and take my time focusing on what's new to me. Then again, I'm not exactly the target audience, so if you prefer sticking strictly to video, that's cool. Anyway, I had a quick look at the first video to see how you're doing and it seemed quite goo... **Dude!** You need to insulate your mic from the impact sounds on your desk. Viewers whose speakers/headphones don't have good bass response might hardly notice it, but for those that do ... every time you're hammering on that keyboard, you're literally pounding on their eardrums :( Not cool. When you look at the waveform, you can see the noise is huge compared to your voice; at times it even clips. You could get a mic boom with a shock mount, or a cheap mic stand that stands next to the desk (ideally on carpet) instead of on it, or simply use a headset or lav mic. Cutting down low frequencies in post might also be a good idea. I guess you weren't even aware of the problem ... you probably should use better speakers or headphones for editing. Doesn't need to be anything fancy; $10 in-ears would do the trick.
Or .ac.uk
I use Hy because I need Python's scientific libraries like Blaze, Numpy, Pandas, etc.. but dislike imperative programming. I believe there are plenty of other similar people, who aren't aware that there is an alternative. Hy is a very practical language, although it does come with the baggage of a niche community.
As others have said, it depends on the type of job you want. Look at some postings that seem appealing and try to identify your skills gaps, and focus on them. Other tips: *learn your algorithms and get good at white board coding - many engineering interviews will test this. * find an open source project you like and contribute to it - having public, easily examined code and working within a group is great experience that most hiring managers enjoy seeing
You should post an issue on the pynsist github and link to this. It would be helpful if there you posted your installer.cfg
IMO one of the biggest strengths of python is the vast amount of libraries and packages developed by the community. In your case, I would start by looking into jupyter notebooks (I suggest the [anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution to make this easy). You can make graphs and plots directly in the web browser. I have even used jupyter notebooks to make presentations before. You can easily save plots to a file with any of the plotting libraries (matplotlib is widely used and I would say the 'standard' for plotting in python). The [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) library combined with the jupyter notebook is especially powerful, and may seem a little more familiar to you if you have used any SQL, R, or even excel.
I use matplotlib right now. Is there a way to save the charts and graphs and stuff as a image?
plt.savefig
Ah! I didn't know it was that bad. I actually like the sound of the keyboard clicks so I didn't really bother much with it. The speakers I use are about $40 or so, I probably don't have good bass response, thus, I didn't really think it would be a problem. Yeah, I think the easiest would be to cut out low-frequencies during editing. I have to look also look into mic booms and shock mounts as well. Thanks for the feedback!
Also this is not meant to be rude but one of the most important skills in coding especially when learning is knowing how to google things you don't know. I have learned pretty much everything I know about pythons from google and stack overflow and this is one of those instances where a quick search would give you a quick answer
Yeah, you just need to have an email from a school they have on record. There's a process for submitting your school if their site doesn't recognize it.
I would suggest raising an issue on the github page for conda (or whatever the appropriate channel is) Looks like it may be an OS specific issue as it is not reproducible on OS X
what is the output of 'where python'
try some of the puzzles over at https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/
Come back when you know. Scratch your own itch.
I've seen those arguments, and it's a fine choice (I wouldn't call it idiotic). But I do think it being abstracted away can often be a positive.
The /r/learnprogramming FAQ has a large number of project ideas.
Depends. There's pros and cons to both. The biggest con is of course there's a weird global you're using, it's not really a global as it changes thread to thread and it requires a weird dance to set it up (current app is weirder because you could possibly have multiple different app contexts during a single request, not that it's a good idea). The pro is that you don't need to worry about how the heck you're going to get something from the request context into your thing, you simply grab what you need from it. Of course, an undisciplined use of request, current app, etc can lead to poorly designed code, but even if it were injected ala Django or aiohttp, you can still very poorly design your code. 
&gt; I actually like the sound of the keyboard clicks Yeah, the part of the typing sound that reaches the mic through the air—what you're normally hearing, when you aren't pressing an ear to the desk (let alone both ;)—can be totally fine. Luckily the structure-borne sound is usually confined to low frequencies that don't really overlap with voice anyway (unless you're [Avi Kaplan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avi_Kaplan)), so there's a good chance you can tame it without spending money. The fancier mic booms can get quite expensive, especially if your mic doesn't have a standard-size hand grip, but those are designed to stay silent even if you move them around while talking. When you don't need to record 'as live' or move around, improvised DIY solutions are hardly worse.
Codefights, exercism.io, codebat. Bunch of sites. Google them.
this sounds ideal for my scenario, thanks for the recommendation. I will definitely give this one a look.
In my work environment, this is pretty standard (; I was hoping for literature to break that standard.
I briefly looked at these. Think Python seems to follow a popular structure Ive seen in other books. I havent looked at the others yet but Ill get to those. Do you have the direct youtube videos to each of these authors?
Seems like a practical crash course book. Looking at the preview on Amazon Id say this has a lot of good info such as PEP 8 which I was not aware of. Thanks, Ill order a copy of this to read on my bedside.
I agree with the pyinstaller recommendation, I've used it successfully with Python 3 several times. I've also used it with PyQt, though recently there was an issue where it didn't work anymore (with PyQt). Don't know if this is fixed now. 
Find projects to do. The best way to learn is to do. 'learn python the hard way' is supposed to be a pretty good book to get you started. 
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython. We **highly encourage** you to re-submit your post over on there. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community is actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers. If you have a question to do with homework or an assignment of any kind, please make sure to read their sidebar rules **before** submitting your post. If you have any questions or doubts, feel free to reply or send a modmail to us with your concerns. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
Wget. Start there
Thanks, fixed.
You will need to be much more specific. It's hard to tell from your description what you are asking for but if you mean you want to know if there is incoming traffic on (not from) port 80 then run Wireshark and filter by TCP or HTTP or whatever protocol it is. If it's HTTP and you want to actually do something with this traffic (log it, modify it, etc.) then look into setting up a reverse proxy such as nginx. None of this is to do with port scanning or Python.
So far in my experience, the globals leads down that path much faster - but you're definitely right any code can be written with poor design.
I watch this guy alot. He taught me django and react.js and I think he's a pretty good teacher. I haven't gone through this series of videos(always been on my todo list but never got around to it), but it may give you a good starting point(his source code may help too). Good luck! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRW90GASSXE&amp;list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGA8Vys-f48mAH9OKSUyav0q
Last I checked, I'm pretty sure the [Udacity cs101](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-computer-science--cs101) goes through building a web crawler in Python.
oh, really thank you, I thing it's helpful, I will watch this series carefully! Thx
Thank you! I like it!
Check the sidebar, there a whole list of good books there.
wooo, it's pretty cool, I like this website, thank you very much. :)
r/dailyprogrammer is another good place.
Here are a couple of solutions I was thinking of: 1) I can put a small rug under my keyboard - that would act as an insulation between desk and the keyboard, maybe that would prevent the echo/vibration. 2) remove my mic from my desk and put it on a separate stool I'm testing out both, but it's hard for me to tell. I guess I will need to test it out with some headphones. 
A mousepad or two under the mic might even do the trick. 
The best part is that my university email address is for life, so as it stands I can get it for free indefinitely.
To my knowledge it should be in two part: First part : don't Second part : if you still ask don't
My school is .org.uk and did not work. So I emailed them, they looked at my school website and gave it to me.
`print("I'm pickle Rick !!!")` much easier...
Yes, other frameworks do it -- **as an implementation detail**. Thread locals are a necessary evil, but they are abstracted away and only used as an escape hatch when needed. There is not a single reasonable argument to design the entire API around accessing request state through some magical thread local imports. I've seen the sort of garbage code people come up with where the HTTP request is imported everywhere. Congrats, you've just coupled everything to Flask. Explicit is better than implicit. This stupid bullshit belongs in Ruby on Rails, not Python.
Lame AND you don't get to Pickle "Rick" :-D
But yes, much easier 
&gt;It would be great if they actually write a program that will deadlock if your run it It's not too hard to set up just by having functions acquiring the lock in different orders. Eg. here's a simple example: import threading l1 = threading.Lock() l2 = threading.Lock() def func1(): while 1: with l1, l2: print("Hi, This is thread 1") def func2(): while 1: with l2, l1: print("Hi, This is thread 2") t1=threading.Thread(target=func1) t2=threading.Thread(target=func2) t1.start() t2.start() t1.join() That'll print a few times, then stop as soon as it gets into a situation where thread1 acquires l1 and thread2 acquires l2, leaving neither able to get the other lock they need to continue. &gt;is there a good way to test for a dead-locking edge case? One common approach is static analysis of code. Ie. the structure of the program is examined looking for potential code paths that could result in a deadlock state. You can also potentially use runtime tools (eg [helgrind](http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/hg-manual.html)) that analyse the order locks are acquired in various threads, and warn you about dangerous one, even when they don't actually result in deadlock in that particular instance. (Eg. even if the above code got really lucky and never got scheduled between lock acquisition, it would still be able to see that thread1 acquired lock1 then lock2 without releasing lock1 and vice versa for thread2, and warn about this as a potential deadlock.
integration of flask patterns for live templates. better Auto completion and jinja2 support. for instance: it parses your routes and notifies you about duplicated routes. you can jump into templates. you can access your context with auto completion in jinja. and you can do a lot of web front end stuff in pro. 
Try [ProjectEuler](https://projecteuler.net/about) if you can handle your math
Lots of uncommon style in it, but the content was good. The thing that annoyed me the most was the first string in the sleeper function. :D
Been working with Python for years, been interviewed *many* times ... never once been asked any of those questions.
Time. On your hands. Too much. **Edit**: also, **3** *hours*? WTAF?
Posting it here because I didn't have luck on /r/learnpython. I don't think that this is against the rules, but I understand if it needs to be moderated.
Yet another meaningless comment clearly indicating that you have no evidence to support your claim that flask is `old and broken`.
I've asked or been asked 1 of those questions. It's a lazy article that makes me seriously question if the author has ever held a python job.
They sold have sent you an email for applying it to existing. They did for me
This seems to be badly written click bait. Some of these questions cover completely inconsequential issues (Why would you ever use PYTHONSTARTUP in professional development work?) and most are written in vague way, so they don't have a clear answer. And don't even get me started on the grammar, spelling and syntax. Which bots are upvoting this?
Tell us more - are these administration Jobs that need to run on specific machines or are they batch jobs that could execute anywhere?
Why is he trying to piss off the devs when both products are free? 
indeed the content was good, I mean, good enough that today I'm sharing this video with my juniors :)
A smart move. You might find this [Proposed new syntax](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2017-August/724516.html) of interest.
Sanic is old and broken now, it's all about apistar now
Your comment may be flippant, but absolutely true, and should not have been downvoted. Because "don't" it is the best possible advice here, especially for beginners. There is currently no sound reason to use multithreading in Python (CPython at least). I get it, I really do. It's tempting to use threads, they seem like a good idea, they're fun to code and think about, you get to play with locks and synchronisation, shared state, and other toys,... but you will shoot yourself in the foot with them. Threads introduce all sorts of potential for performance problems, scalability issues, bugs, deadlocks, needless complexity, and more. I've seen them all over the years, and in every single case the authors thought thought they were doing the opposite. Even if you write correct, safe, multithreaded Python code (and you probably can't) , it can cause major problems... And subtle ones that bite you in production. Otherwise bullet-proof code can break spectacularly when threaded. Library code and Python built-ins you've depended on for years will start to exhibit strange behaviours. Threads will race, lockstep, and block each other for seemingly no reason. Performance will drop even when your other threads are idle. Throughput will mysteriously go down, even though you've increased parallelism. Timing functions will start misbehaving. Socket code will start producing errors you've never encountered before. I can go on and on and on. Anyone who is confident in their ability to write safe multithreaded code is over-confident. Beginners have no chance to write safe, we'll performing multithreaded code. Do it to learn, but dear Bob don't let a junior dev deploy multithreaded code in production. I've drastically improved the performance and availability of many multithreaded Python systems by *removing* multithreading. In every single case, multithreading was introduced to improve performance or scalability, and in every single case it backfired. After decades of experience dealing with it, rule number 1 of multithreading in Python is most definitely: don't. You want fast scalable Python? Multiplex your sockets where i/o bound, and use multiprocessing and/or CSP for everything else, only when you really need it, and keep it as simple as possible. That's not the whole story, but it's a big head start. The only good thing to come from letting people use multithreading in Python is the experience they'll gain when they eventually realise it's a mistake.
Python multithreading for beginners: ... Never mind, just use javascript
Pretty sure this will error if there is no module loaded with a name starting with 'p' and ending with 'e'.
The whole point of using tuples is that we don't WANT the tuple to undergo changes.
It will error anyway if Pickle isn't imported \^\^
Threads are better than processes when implementing a GUI, some webservers (if multithreaded model) and some data science/ machine learning. CherryPy is a very common Python web framework. It uses threads to improve performance. Reasons to use threads over processes: - Low memory footprint per thread so you can spawn more for things like IO tasks - Can save RAM by reusing an object. If you have a huge - 10s of gigs object it would take forever to copy it to other processes and also you might run out of RAM. This is extremely common in machine learning applications. So if you have an IO-bound application that uses such an object, you are either going to have to forgo concurrency or use threads since multiprocessing is not an option.
This is utter nonsense. There is no sense in even trying to correct all the grammatical errors, because rewriting it would be less effort. But in the end all this effort would be wasted anyway because the content is just completely wrong. &gt;tuples are immutable means can't change or modifie but only can be updated if their are more then one tuple You are contradicting yourself within the same sentence. And your method for "updating" tuples only creates an new tuple by concatenation. How is that updating?
Fortunately, the author did not supply a way to undermine that.
Indeed. There are valid use-cases for tuple concatenation, but this doesn't seem to be one of them.
xD This really needs to become a github project.
Neither of your reasons as stated need threads, and can be done more simply and more efficiently without them. You are proving my point. It's also impossible to state that threads are better without knowing the specific details, but threads in Python come with *so many* pitfalls, it's almost always a better idea to use processes first. Even when threads start to look like a good idea, there are technologies and libraries you can use that take you far, far beyond what you can roll yourself using Python threads. And spawning threads for I/o bound applications can be a recipe for disaster. Multiplexing is generally much more scalable, with a pool of isolated workers for longer-running tasks to prevent blocking the io queue. Unless you're Google, I can saturate your fast network pipe and fancy SSD storage systems using a single Python thread serving tens of thousands of clients concurrently. If you're not exceeding that scenario, you don't need to complicate things by introducing threads. Some of your examples hold up better in other languages/implementations, but not in CPython, and none of them would be beginner's task. Even where threads are a good idea, I would stress keeping state as isolated as possible. EDIT: sure, keep the downvotes coming. I've made a lot of money over the years fixing shoddy Python multithreading code, and it looks like I will continue to do so...
Yeah, I'm not sure what OP is trying to achieve here.
Please stop.
Consider using [context managers](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0343/) to handle opening and closing of files, e.g.: with open("PR.obj", "wb") as file: pickle.dump(rS. file) 
Flask did it because bottle did it. For a little bit of history: Flask started as a bottle clone. It is the successor of [denied](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2010/4/3/april-1st-post-mortem/), an April fools joke that Armin published in direct response to bottle getting popular. 
Prevention might be better than the cure but i found audacity to be useful for fixing up audio after it has been recorded. It might have a feature that can help you with keyboard clicks. I use the method in the video below for ambient noise. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=if3pvQKYuts 
You're right - I didn't mention I meant the class code specifically.
&gt; I notice a space between localhost and \administrator. Not sure if that's a typo or a copy/paste Can you share your python code and batch file?
&gt; Personally, I'd like to have long-form stuff like this also available in HTML form Here here. This is my greatest issue with the video movement on the internet. With some stuff I don't mind just listening, but when it comes to learning something new I want to be able to read it and parse it over and over. With long form video this becomes a slighty harder because you're scrubbing back and forth.

&gt; Yes, other frameworks do it -- as an implementation detail. [DotNet does this](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.httpcontext.current(v=vs.110\).aspx) and it's extremely handy for managing context aware dependency injection. I don't even want to think of what sort of contortions you'd need to do if the request needed to be explicitly passed to resolvers. &gt; I've seen the sort of garbage code people come up with where the HTTP request is imported everywhere. Congrats, you've just coupled everything to Flask. As opposed to how almost every webapp is hopelessly coupled to its framework. I've made a few that aren't, and it's soothing to know I could replace it with another and not rewrite a big chunk of the application. Go look at just about any open source webapp. All the logic is in controllers, and if it isn't, it's tied directly to framework concepts. I'll offer Kegbot and the GDQ donation tracker as examples. reddit was largely the same last time I looked at the source. The first two use Django and reddit is Pyramid. `request` being a global isn't the problem, crappy design is the issue. Otherwise we wouldn't talk about Django apps, we'd talk about apps that just do happen to use Django. If you do separate your logic from your web app, isolating the request global from the logic isn't hard. But there's not many good examples of that because there's not many webapps that aren't tied to their framework. &gt; Explicit is better than implicit. This stupid bullshit belongs in Ruby on Rails, not Python. Pragmatism beats purity. Armin, myself, and others feel that a thread local request is pragmatic. 
Post processing to remove clicks too is easy enough, but can distort other aspects of the sound 
It may not be the best solution if you've already got lots of cronjobs, but if you use systemd 'timers' in place of cron jobs, you can easily see when each one last ran and will next run. https://blog.tjll.net/systemd-for-impatient-sysadmins/#tricks-with-timers
Super nice link!

Thank you!. Going to test it out. I wonder if Adobe premier has a similar feature. 
Would that be by calling pip3?

Check out [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/). Basically, it's a site of user-created programming problems to solve with a fair number of different languages. After you solve (or give up), you can see what the community thought the fastest or most unique solution was. Great for learning new tricks!
While it's a good deal, IMHO, the community edition is already a complete package. Deployed multiple projects using it, including web projects.

Hi. Thanks, I did post it [there](https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/6tthfb/stream_realtime_data_into_your_spreadsheets/) yesterday. They indeed like the idea a lot. I was curious however what /r/Python would think about it.
What is CSP?
Good luck on your solution!
I use this package and find it excellent for basic task management, has been running on an Ubuntu machine for 3 years without fail (the jobs sometimes fail, but the application does not) http://www.rgordon.co.uk/oddjob/index.html 
It works fine for me using Python 3.54, PyInstaller 3.21, and PyQT 5.9. PyInstaller doesn't work for me and 3.6+ but it's a known bug and will be fixed in PyInstaller 3.3. It supposedly is fixed in the current dev branch but I get the same error there.
I apologize for all the n00bs and CS majors downvoting you. As a software engineer of 20 years experience: If you can at all avoid it, don't use threads.
I'm so fucking upset I haven't been taught this... but honestly, what really takes the "upset cake" for me is the format method.
&gt; CSP Communicating Sequential Processes. Go and Erlang uses it. 
Would be a cool tool, parses a youtube video into a page with a transcript and cleverly chosen stills from the video. 
Thanks. I will play with that and it makes sense. I understood the author's explanation, but I thought an example would help. By the way, even if by magic your code never deadlocked, wouldn't the `t1.join()` always stop it? Is that just there so we do not exit before showing a lock? (since you have a `while 1` loop)? Is that even needed if your threads *aren't* daemon threads? (If they are daemon threads, then i get the need)
They are great. My local library provides its patrons with a free subscription and I've been watching them. Check with your local library just in case they have a similar service available to you. What I ***would*** recommend anyone to steer away from is the *Python Programming Bootcamp 2.0* being peddled around for $40 at many sites. The teachers are awful. 
In answer to your last question, cronjob execution is typically logged to the system logger. On Debian-based systems, those messages are sorted to /var/log/syslog and on Redhat-based systems they are sorted to /var/log/cron. Any additional logging for your cronjob tasks (errors, exit status, etc...) is left to the program being executed. systemd timers are one option where the meta data for the task is kept in the service in systemd which may be easier to keep track of.
There is a /r/learnpython for this sort of stuff, you should also mention exactly what you are struggling with so people can help you.
&gt; wouldn't the t1.join() always stop it? If it didn't deadlock, it wouldn't stop it - it'd just let both threads continue to loop endlessly. It's just there so the main thread doesn't exit. It's not strictly necessary here, since as you say, these are not daemon threads and will continue regardless, but generally I prefer the main thread to be the one "in control" of exiting, as it's clearer where any finalisation logic should be. (though of course in a real program, I should have waited for both threads) 
And you've been voted down too, I see. For the record, I'm a also software engineer with 20+ years experience. I totally understand the downvotes. Everyone goes through a multithreading phase, I think. It's fun. It's cool. Ostensibly, it often looks like it should be the right solution. Eventually, with experience, people realise why it's not such a good idea. The wheel keeps on turning...
Communicating Sequential Processes. Essentially arranging processes in a chain pipelining input from end to the other, where the processes run in parallel, so the next process can be processing data while the previous process is producing more. It's consistently vastly underestimated because of its simplicity, yet often outperforms more complex "fan out" parallel frameworks by orders of magnitude. People seem to have an instinct that parallel means "fan out", which drives complexity, introduces many often-unnecessary overheads, and is prone to errors, and doesn't give the speed ups people expected. CSP is simpler, and its simplicity leads to easier optimization. You reduce the need for locks and shared state, etc. and you can still apply a fan-out approach at each stage later where appropriate. Last year I replaced a fancy parallel bulk data processing system that used a clustered fan-out approach, with an almost pure-Python CSP alternative. The old system had multithreading, task queues, parallel worker pools, batches, bits rewritten in Java and C to get better performance, the works. Almost all of it a complete waste of.time. It had reliability problems, mysterious deadlocks. The new system gave a 1000x speedup, rock solid reliability. A whole bunch of expensive servers replaced with just a handful. A huge codebase that no single person understood, with dependencies on large frameworks, to a much smaller codebase that could be maintained by an individual. Don't underestimate simplicity.
I think a lot people are trying to move to /r/JupyterNotebooks if they're heavy into python and analytics.
We use Chronos https://github.com/mesos/chronos. It allows for integration with Github for continuous deployment. It also keeps historical STDOUT and STDERR output, along with the ability to real-time see what scripts are running.
Thanks for the response! It looks like the whoosh_search function contains the line `if not isinstance(query, unicode):` which is throwing `NameError: name 'unicode' is not defined`. I think this is means that it is not Py3 compatible but there could be a workaround I am not aware of, since it seems like 2 years ago the only problem was that Async indexing issue you mentioned. Do you know of any workaround for this?
tl;dr?
no worries
for posterity: it now also supports the 8 sprites of the commodore-64, including double scaling. It is impossible however to support sprite-background priority (so the sprites are always on top) and collision detection. How useful they are to make a simple game thus remains to be seen :P
They need to run on the specific machine e.g master node which dispatch all the jobs to queue to perform the crawling process etc.
I have checked luigi framework in the past, airflow seems to be similar to that, but it is used mainly for the data pipeline.
This looks good, thanks.
Why not do it all in Jenkins. The situation you described is 75% of what Jenkins does. 
This is pretty amazing. Thank you.
I feel like most data can be saved to a pickle pretty easily and then we can use Pandas or similar framework to do the work. However, a lot of corporations still rely on excel -- so that it may be useful. Good Luck!
Is not Jenkins will be supposed to run the job only in case of deployment etc. In our case, we need to run it after every 10-15 mins.
You can set a cron-style schedule. It also offers flexibility in case a machine was temporarily offline or overloaded.
You don't usually need to send whole objects, though - if it appears that way, it's probably because the design did not account for that. Plus, that has potentially drastically bad security implications (RCE vulns are among the worst). It might even defeat the purpose, as unintentionally excessive/unnecessary io is the easiest way to write python that does not perform well. Send state parameters and instantiate in the subprocess, or use subprocesses to do more individual operations, and have the objects in the master process communicate with the subprocesses to have them perform individual operations for them. Threads are not really different in this case either, except that shared memory is easier to come by. This has its own caveats that need to be accounted for, though. My ultimate point is that multithreading and multiprocessing have code design implications in *any* language. Python is not better than most other languages, but it's also not really any worse, either. Whatever language you choose, there are still benefits and drawbacks to implementing concurrent/threaded/multiprocessed code paths, and architecting to best solve the actual problem *always* takes some planning ahead. 
Can you post code examples where multiplexing sockets and CSP beats a decent threaded implementation?
This is the Python sub isn't it?
Why?
Seems more reasonable to just use something like pyrsistent or even mochi.
Also /r/finance 
True. One of the usecases for Gridarrow, however, would be to use frameworks like Pandas to gather and initially preprocess the data, and then stream it to spreadsheets for users to consume. This way you let Python do all the heavy lifting on the server and keep your spreadsheets light.
That's a pretty broad question and there's tons of tutorials out there covering it. In a nutshell, it's a way to run a several parts of code at the same time (asynchronously). So rather than waiting for function1() to complete before starting function2(), both run at the same time. It's analogous to threading or mulitprocessing, which are different methods of doing the same thing. One of the biggest uses is in webservers. For instance, while Reddit's servers are waiting for your slow internet connection to be ready for more data, it can use the downtime to send other data to other users instead of just idly waiting on you. --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
I'm really happy you like the idea :)
thanks /u/APIglue! I'll let them know for sure
I am currently learning Python on my own until I finish my Commerce program at University. I will pursue it after. Here is one of my first programs... What do you think? # What kind of triangle is it? a = int(input(' The length of side a = ')) b = int(input('The length of side b = ')) c = int(input(' The length of side c = ')) if a != b and b != c and a != c: print('This is a Scalene triange') elif a == b and b ==c: print('This is a equilateral triangle') else: print(' this is a isosceles triangle') 
Could you do one for multi processing too?
Commenting so I can come back to this later, thanks!
For me it's python 2
Thanks for posting! As a newbie to python(and I mean newbiee), I thought it was well done with good examples. Very helpful
Thank you so much for the answer, gonna go to that subreddit to learn more :) Currently writing something for twitter, see if I can manage to code my own :) Thanks alot &lt;3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv25Dwe84g0 IMO, best place to start when you want to understand multithreading in python.
Just signed up. My company depends heavily on excel so this would be tremendous for us.
This is the only one in this thread I would not agree with. Something new programmers need ZERO exposure to is terrible to read, and understand, minimalist code. Code golf is definitely a skill, but I think it is detrimental to writing maintainable code.
Certainly. I only bring it up because not everything in code seems to be for srsbsns. Sometimes having fun you can learn new things.
I feel a really strong need to correct you, sorry. But the way you are describing it makes it sound like like asynchronous code is equivalent to multiprocessing, which it is not. Asynchronous code does not automatically run in parallel, meaning simultaneous, with other code. Rather it is an easy way to "do something else" while waiting for a different program to complete. For example: A webserver can send a query to a database and while waiting for the database to deliver a response, can start working on a different clients request. Asyncronous code, by itself, does not allow you to have two (or more) of your functions running in parallel.
Quite interested in this potentially, signed up online how long till a working version is ready to test?
I see. That can be a good idea. The leaning curve for SQL and so on is very flat while you can learn rather quickly Excel. And excel people could focus on the presentation while one person can be in charge of using the service like Gridarrow.
I know; I'm trying to pull it down to a very basic level here. And I said it's *analogous* to multiprocessing, not equivalent to it. 
I can understand why a lot of people would want(even need) something like this. Legacy code bases are a legitimate problem. But i really want to scream: let Python2 die already, for f***s sake. Fortunately i didn't.
Thanks! We have to ask you for a bit of patience from your side. We still need few weeks probably. We'll keep you posted! 
I've been working on cardiological research software for the Erasmus university in Rotterdam, all in Python 3.6 and OpenGL. Also I've been programming a robot dog using Lego Mindstorms and Python on a micro-SD chip, downloaded from www.ev3dev.org. It will be used to teach programming to teachers and kids at the local primary school. In the time that was left I've been working on Transcrypt, an open source Python to JavaScript compiler, to be had at www.transcrypt.org. 
There is an abstract right at the top: &gt; This PEP proposes a new mechanism to manage execution state--the logical environment in which a function, a thread, a generator, or a coroutine executes in. &gt; A few examples of where having a reliable state storage is required: &gt; * Context managers like decimal contexts, ``numpy.errstate``, and ``warnings.catch_warnings``; &gt; * Storing request-related data such as security tokens and request data in web applications, implementing i18n; &gt; * Profiling, tracing, and logging in complex and large code bases. &gt; The usual solution for storing state is to use a Thread-local Storage (TLS), implemented in the standard library as ``threading.local()``. Unfortunately, TLS does not work for the purpose of state isolation for generators or asynchronous code, because such code executes concurrently in a single thread.
"concurrent" does not mean "simultaneous", it means tasks that begin and execute in overlapping time periods. It is accurate to apply to asyncio as well as the others (no fan of asyncio here). Parallelism describes "simultaneous". related: [parallelism vs concurrency](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1050257/34549)

You try to recreate the first video-game ever: pong! http://www.transcrypt.org/live/transcrypt/demos/pong/pong.min.html I remember my father got it for free with a full tank of fuel at the local gas station, some 40 years ago... 
Hi! What exactly happened? Could you try again? If you still have problems you can pm me your email and I'll add you manually.

See the video, he talks about calling rust from python
Why didn't you put that in the title?
Imagine you call the customer service line at Verizon, and the first thing they do is put you on hold, and that too loud Kenny-G-on-a-recorder-muzak-shit starts playing. Now you know you aren't ever going to get a good answer, or even a correct one, but your ass is still stuck, *waiting*, until either that kid in the call center in Bangalore or Manila answers and tells you his name -- against all odds -- is Steve, or sweet merciful death arrives. That is *synchronous IO*. The *parallel* version is 10,000 of you planning a random choice between suicide or murder, and 5 Steves. Now, imagine you call Apple, and the first thing they do is offer you an option to be called back, and you take it. You don't know when you'll hear from them, and you'll have to defer your curiosity on what that spinning beachball fundamentally *means*, but in the meantime you can do other, meaningful things, like play with your kids, watch YouTube, or research alternatives to Verizon, all while you wait for that promise of a future to return. Then your phone rings. It's Steve. No, not *that* Steve. Or *that* one. But Steve. That is *asynchronous IO*. The *parallel* version is 10,000 of you getting on with your lives, and 5 Steves waiting on a long list of promises.
Because that's not the title of the video

Finding good stills to insert into a transcript would indeed be a cool topic for a machine learning research paper. (We can assume a transcript exists, because generating captions already is a well defined and worked-on problem anyway.) But that's not at all what I meant by 'available in HTML form'. Picture this: You'd like to learn how to get up on the hunting perch on E1M1. Ideally, you'd find [this page](http://pirat.snotboble.net/quake/e1m1.html): scrolling through lets you identify #5 as the relevant part in seconds, thanks to the illustrations. Even better, a [closer look](http://pirat.snotboble.net/quake/pics/e1m15.jpg) reveals a picture that concisely sums up the best approach. This seems much better than the [pure text version](http://www.fatpat.com/software/personal/quake/secrets.htm#LE1M1), which is as long as the rant you're currently reading. Now, consider what it would be like if you had only been able to find [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q_F1euqPFg) about the same topic. It would be a great resource if you wanted to watch an expert go over the entire topic, but all you want is figure out how not to fall into the acid another five times. You can scrub over the time-line, but none of the thumbnails shows the right spot. At this point, I'd consider installing a YT-download script that would enable me to scrub over all the frames in VLC, in full size, while the video is still downloading. Scrolling through a page with bigger pictures that are more cleverly chosen seems like a neat alternative at first glance. But even if you get the perfect angle, it won't have the red arrows that show you what to do. And even if instead of a caption that just says "climb the stairs" (duh, we already knew that), there was a transcript of some proper narration, chances are it would be less like "... jump on the handrail, then on to the lamp and then the switch plate ...", but more like "... and from here jump there, alley-oop, ba-da bing, ba-da boom, Bob's your uncle". This seems much worse than the pure text version.
What's wrong with passing an object around?

Even if it doesn't, it lets you use audio plug-ins, and failing that, it's not a big deal to bounce the audio track to and back from another program, such as Audacity. Audacity is ridiculously powerful for an ancient FOSS tool; on top of the integrated effects, it can also host VST/AudioUnit plug-ins and [Nyquist](http://www.audacityteam.org/about/nyquist/) scripts. Tons of fun if you're interested in DSP. However, the above-mentioned noise reduction method isn't very suitable for eliminating transients; it's what you would use to dampen more consistent noise, e.g. the whoosh of computer fans or the hum from a ground loop. You're better off with a straight-forward low cut (a.k.a. [high pass](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/audio-effects-transitions.html)).
How does that solve state isolation? state isolation is probably the core problem being solved.
Have you thought about using Celery for this?
It's a math question, not a programming question.
All this tells me is that the algorithm you use for this particular problem isn't good enough. You could look into creating a faster algorithm by analysing what is so expensive about your code, and replacing it with a better idea; alternatively, you can potentially solve your efficiency problem by looking up an efficient mathematical equation that does exactly what you need. 
I'd say to find some online practical courses first before getting into books. You can have a book along the side, but start with Codeacademy which has free Python courses!
Interesting, didn't expect to see Pharma company listed on there!
Will have to try it on my PC:)
&gt; Could you elaborate it a bit more , since in my mind when you distribute module , target is user? Sure thing. To give you some context, I am actually a Mechanical Engineer, and entirely self taught in programming (along with some good books and advice along the way). I work for a company that build industrial equipment, and who are currently defining the state of the art in our field. I use python to automate our 3D modelling software. The python programs alter the 3D model, and then run various analyses (centre of gravity position reporting, stress analysis, endurance life, etc.). To run these by hand would mean i can only do a few per day, as most of my time would be spent making the changes to the models and submitting the analyses. Where the two different coding styles come in is as follows: The management at the company do not care how I have automated the software, so this would be the first example I gave (terse code with plenty of syntatic sugar). What they do care about is whether any calculations performed by the scripts are correct, as everything we do is peer reviewed and signed off. Therefore I will submit calculations to fellow engineers who may not understand all of the language tricks you can use, so i find it is better to be verbose (e.g. for-loop instead of a list comprehension). &gt;So I understand when you say that you don't care about width of line. But when you say neat... Do you mean logical or aesthetic ? Thats a good question, I couldn't say for sure which. I guess it would be aesthetically pleasing to me, which in some cases is based on logic. A few examples: I hate having if statements split across two lines as it looks horrendous and is harder to read than a single long line. I use double quotes by default for my string charecter. I honestly cannot tell you why but it is too engrained now to change I like to seperate parts of my code that arent directly related by a single blank line. I think it makes it easier to read than one big block. I prefer my comments to be on the same line as the code they refer to, even if they go over the recommended line length, then there is no confusion as to which line the comment refers to. Hope all the above is a good enough explanation!
Interesting, although I doubt any serious C project would start using Python as their main testing language.
Oh I get it, thank you both!
Avoid scraping if you can a find an API and using a Python SDK like https://github.com/seemethere/nba_py may help. You will do less time fiddling scrapping and more time with the data.
I would argue to start with Beautifulsoup, no? This wouldn't really be a *crawler*, just a scraper, ESPN/NBA.com have predictable/static url's for game scores, hell they might even have an API at this point. Aside from the actual data-gathering aspect, you'd need some data analysis intuition: i.e. do you simply predict based on who has more wins? Do you incorporate hot/cold streaks, play-styles, etc. There's a lot going on here that you need to consider. Most of it would be called "data science" so search for beginner guides to that and it will show you what paths you can take.
The idea being you have an immutable object with the state in it. You then pass that info functions that need it
Has anyone tried datanitro for this? It's been around for a while...
A good example is `decimal` - there's a context for that, which specifies precision, rounding rules, etc. You can't pass that in to `x + y`.
I mean ... consider that for a second. Either * per the pep, a decorator knows its own state * all my code has to be architected so there is a state manager i'm passing hand configured objects around with. Conceptually, these states SHOULD be independent and so it implies the language needs to be fixed. Even so, I don't want to hand manage context objects in all my code.
Does anybody use docker with only pycharm CE? how do you debug?

I saw a demo by Microsoft at an educational show where they were feeding data into excel from various hacked together experiments (mostly using Arduino). Anyway, the MS guy who developed the excel plugin to monitor the incoming data had done some incredible stuff with graphics in his worksheets - he used bar charts with custom graphics to create live animations (of buildings shaking in the earthquake experiment for example). Here's a video with a demo at the 1:45 mark: https://youtu.be/r5xvjJdHJVM Here's s link to the project page. There are several other projects available: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/education-workshop/seismograph.aspx 
Most people will chose their field of study based on where most of the jobs are. That means that there is probably higher competition for these jobs. There's a reason I don't market myself as a WordPress specialist, even though I often end up troubleshooting or working with WordPress sites. I focus on the core code, not the CMS. Sure, there are more jobs in WordPress, but I prefer focusing on more niche things like accessibility or custom work. That gives me a smaller client pool, sure, but I have enough experience at this point to be able to hand folks a list of what I do by default, which includes features the average "Oh, I can build you a website!" folks don't know or bother with, like some things that talk to search engine bots or give bad bots the figurative finger. So I actually suggest you go for data science. ETA: I hang around here because Python's on my to-learn list for fun, and I've converted some of my PHP scripts into Python. My 2¢ is based on my general experience and observation of how job markets work, not specifically of the Python market.
Sounds intriguing. Any good references for learning CSP in python? Thanks for the real world insights. 
Thanks! That's a great algorithm which has as only downside to only been implementde via gephi. This software is good but I enjoy way more scripted tools.
You sure can. x + y should return a function that takes a context and returns a decimal
You should hand manage that yourself. If you want it easier you can use the Reader monad
Thank you. This looks very good. They give real time data in minute increments. Curious to know what did you build with it. 
Oh I haven't built anything with it, I was just offering suggestions :P I build scrapers for satellite data currently 
Oh ok. Thanks for the link. I will start building something soon.

As Brian Moore, former England rugby international and now commentator would say, "that's dumb".
You have no idea wtf you're talking about. 
would rather not have to rely on a 3rd party site
awesome! 
Made a webapp with flask that lets me scan barcodes from my phone and POST them to the server (using automate/tasker), which formats them nicely and spits them out into a table that allows for easy copy/paste to excel. Makes doing laptop inventory a lot quicker
If it works and you're not harming anyone.. It works! If you're worried someone will use this as a malicious exploit do tell the devs. It sounds like bad practice to leave such an endpoint open.
You should avoid using pip globally and only installing in a venv so a global name is not relevant, e.g. $ python3 -m venv env $ env/bin/pip --version pip 9.0.1 from /home/mark/env/lib/python3.6/site-packages (python 3.6)
What advantages are there over existing libraries? (ex openpyxl)
I don't think this is unethical. The developers have created the API to allow requests without authentication, cookies, etc. I use this technique regularly when I scrape. It's no different than a normal API imo, except there isn't any documentation.
&gt;To run these by hand would mean i can only do a few per day. I know your pain, for an architect structural and material static stress analysis and dimensioning can be exhausting when doing by hand, and i can't even imagine what kind of math goes into what you do. *On personal note: if you don't mind answering some mechanical logistic question: I designed in college a building where i had normal sized ships helm and bigger helm ( height in about 30 m ) where smaller helm (1.5 height) could operate bigger one - as touristic attraction. I tried and even devised some idea of controlling mechanism ( even tried to calculate the number of teeth on gear wheel for transmission system) to determine the size and stability of said element. In the end, math and dynamic part of mechanic subject was too much for me. The main possible problem i was thinking of is overall mass movement, momentum i need to generate for bigger wheel is in lay terms proportional to the difference in massxradius if acceleration is constant. Can you tell me is it doable by idea (smaller one controlling large one ) ?* **Have in mind, i am not currently in position to pay for advice, so if you want to give your assessment, it will be free** Now that personal blunder has gone out of way, yeah i understand. Thank you for clarifying , it was very helpful, and as i see it you are very generous here, since you could easily say : "here it is, figure it out" but you take the time to write different versions. Hats off , sir :D &gt;I use double quotes by default for my string character. I honestly cannot tell you why but it is too engrained now to change I had same problem ( before my laziness overpowered me ) but i was influenced by c++ , where double quotes are strings, and single quotes are characters, like *unicode*/*unichr* in python 2.7 but with syntaxic data separation. &gt;Hope all the above is a good enough explanation! Yeah, it was. Thank you! :D And in the end, whenever i am reading someone else code i need to take time and learn to read that "neatness", so diving into it is kinda job requirement. 
Glad you did--I'm not in the Excel sub, but I do use Excel a lot at work. This sounds promising!
Sounds cool. Is this software free? And how is it different than DataNitro?
When do you plan on putting this bad boy in production?
This could, easily, be both unethical *and* illegal. Assuming this isn't a public API -- and the weak JS attempt to enforce login suggests it's not -- then to a reasonable person the intent of the company is to keep their data behind an authorization wall and a EULA. If they've got a robots.txt set to Disallow or a meta tag set to noindex, NOFOLLOW, the reasonable person might also see that as a sign the intent was to keep data private and that it was only accidentally exposed. The fact that you've figured out how to bypass those controls doesn't mean it's any more legitimate than rifling thorough the contends of a poorly secured purse when the owner has turned around. The recent LinkedIn case notwithstanding this isn't exactly settled law, and though they did lose that case it was about data that was both intentionally and knowingly left open to public view which they believed should not be open to scraping. In this case it might simply be an oversight. I'd err on the side of asking permission, personally.
Join the lot together. You'll find a way.
Killing myself trying to find the money for uni :(
No wheels and no asyncio?
Hey, I am interested in something similar. I am hoping you could help me out. I am a little familiar with web scraping using Python. I have not used Beautiful Soup, but have used TagSoup. What I want to do is create a program that can check and let me know if any course grades are posted. I was hoping to do something similar to what you said- basically see if the page has changed at all, and send myself a notification. What I don't know how to do is access a webpage behind a sign in screen. What would you recommend I use to access a webpage behind a sign-in screen. Someone suggested I use headless browser using java. What do you think?
Are you sure it's blocked? https://github.com/seemethere/nba_py/issues/88
You can patch [this](https://github.com/seemethere/nba_py/blob/master/nba_py/__init__.py) file to [use proxies](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#proxies) in the get call.
and then you need a lock for threads/ sync etc
Depends on the terms of usage, but as long as you are not hammering the site I would have no moral compunction. 
Why would it need a lock?
This is awesome. Exactly what i needed. Also can you guarantee that script has never corrupted an excel file? Because openpyxl does it sometimes when i use certain functions many times
I've got a problem i've been stuck on for a few days. I only started learning Python maybe three weeks ago so if someone has an answer to my problem I may need it dumbed down a little... I've been working on a basic string encryption program; a password manager kind of thing. It's basically been my framework for learning Python as I've gone through various stages of completion using more complex methods to build it each time. Now at the moment I'm using the Fernet symmetric encryption section of the cryptography package to do the actual encryption but I'm running into a problem: Once the user has input the text they wish to encrypt the program generates a 32 url-safe base64 encoded bit key and then encrypts the text string. The cryptography.fernet module (I think that's what it's called? Please correct me if I'm wrong.) appears to save the encrypted string and key as long as the same instance of the program that created them is open, or until the user encrypts another string which it replaces the old one with. I want the program to have the capability to be closed and reopened at a later date so the user can use a passcode to retrieve their encrypted text. In order to achieve this I tried converting the key and encrypted string into seperate .txt files, the the program can open and decrypt at a later date - this is where i ran into my problem, which so far specifically involves the key. The script is intended to open and read the 'key.txt' file, then using url-safe base 64, encode the string into the correct 'format' so that it can be used to decrypt the text. When I run the script, the interpreter throws an error saying: &gt;encoded=binascii.b2a_base64(s)[:-1] TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not str To clarify; to encode the key.txt file from string to base 64 I used &gt; base64.urlsafe_b64encode(string) I also tried not converting the key to a string in the first place and saving it as a .png file, but when I tried to use that key I got a similar "key must be 32 url-safe base 64 encoded bits". If anyone could give me some suggestions on how to save the key and encrypted text that cryptography.fernet outputs, so that i can run the script again later and have it retrieve the key and encrypted text for decryption, it would be greatly appreciated. If anyone has any suggestions on alternate way of doing this process I would be pleased to hear your suggestions. Thanks.
Needed exaclty that a week ago. Done with win32 api and com/dcom objects.
So it's like Kafka but in Python and for Excel?
I agree! And now it is: https://github.com/tpoff/Python-Gif-Ascii-Animator Let me know what you think!
Apparently this modifies an open excel document in real time, rather than writing an excel file that you then open in excel. Can't exactly fathom why you would want to do this… but now you can. 
This is what happens when I get bored lol. And yea, although I didn't really have a set goal for those 3 hours, believe it or not this started as trying to make a loading bar for another project I was working on and it kinda.....evolved.....3 hours later I had this lol. 
This is what I do. I build web apps for data analysis.
Oh, that's neat! :)
I work in the defense sector and depending on the agency holding the contract you could be deploying your product on old linux servers still on 2.6. Upgrading can be finicky or unsupported or just not approved. So if you want to use a little python you're stuck with whatever is there.
my take on scraping/reverse engineering APIs is always: If you don't intend to use it for profit, then public data is public data. If you do, ask.
Thank you for the feedback. I worked hard on creating demonstrable that anyone can understand.
Yeah, I plan on doing one on multiprocessing, as I find multiprocessing much more useful than threading (for the things I do).
Thank you for this. I will have to read everything you linked as I'm not too familiar with the terminology. 
Thank you for your insights. What are you thoughts on Asyncio?

Here's one post that might be helpful. The version of xlwings used is a bit old but it should still work - http://pbpython.com/xlwings-pandas-excel.html
This online book by Michael Nielsen seems like a pretty good introduction: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html I use a simple script for the Stylish add-on to make the pages a bit wider.
How can I keep this running on my RPi forever? I ssh in and run the script with python nohup sudo python SiriControl-System/siricontrol.py &amp; But it eventually stops working. How do you keep it running like a daemon? 
You are technically correct, the best kind of correct. I obviously used the wrong word there, and i shall correct it.
Well as soon as possible. My client manages around 10 properties on airbnb and vrbo. I'm looking to install the boxes in all of the houses by the end of the year for testing.
Can I suggest using the CSV module or one that interacts with Excel spreadsheets to input that data directly into a row? That would be the next logical step so that you can write some details, scan the barcode, hit enter and move onto the next one.
So would you contact the devs and tell them you found such a loophole (which as you describe it makes it seem like you would be telling them you exploited their website, so maybe not such a good idea)? The _hypothetical_ website is a HUGE pain in the ass to use and the scraping makes things so much easier. I guess I am trying to get a gauge for just _how_ bad it would be to continue using it this way. 
this is bullshit. there are certainly problems that can't be solved in reasonable time. there may be tricks like only checking odd numberw, even factors &lt;= n/2 and sieve of erasthothenes that will help. dynamic programming could be possible. but dude 10^12 is a trillion item loop with a n^2 complexity. optimizing your loop isn't the issue. 
You are doing the world a great service by providing an alternative to VBA.
Thanks!
Gonna Google around on CSP but +1 for any recommended resource.
&gt; The reason it’s being called a secure password is because there’s been a use of mixed case, numbers and symbols in the password, which is highly advised to people to keep their passwords protected from hack attacks. I think the above is now old news. The replacement was to think of a longer **pass phrase** that means something to you individually and so is not likely to need writing down, and gains security due to its length. Something like: StephensFluffyHair8mysocks
Hah. Fair enough. Feature creep.
If what you're doing with it is personal and neither money-generating for you (ie you're using their data in some way for the benefit of some other revenue-generating site or service) or money-losing for them (ie you're avoiding a paywall, disclosing the loophole'd data and costing them revenue or user data they use to generate revenue, etc) then I doubt that crossing the line will matter much, but it's still crossing a line. I'd contact them and simply ask them for permission. "Hi, I noticed that xyz url allows me to enter search terms and it seems like a bit of a public-facing API. I couldn't find any documentation of it on painintheass.com/faq, but I've got this doodah I've been meaning to automate and would like to know if it's okay to occasionally scrape a few search terms via this endpoint?". If they answer in the affirmative, yay. If they don't answer at all, go ahead. If the endpoint suddenly vanishes, you've done a mitzvah. **Edit**: also [this might help](https://hackerone.com/disclosure-assistance) if you think it's a real vulnerability.
That's a fair concern. We're also thinking about providing a solution that you can host yourself.
i like this
Just to clarify: I'm not seriously recommending Nyquist for for video editing purposes; that would be like making cuts with ffmpeg from the command line. I just put in the link to say, look at how cool that thing over there is! You know, like one does when telling people they can catch pokémon by [writing machine code](https://glitchcity.info/wiki/Arbitrary_code_execution) :)
Please check if you have javascript enabled and if your adblocker (or ScriptBlock or anything like that) doesn't block javascript there. Our subscription form requires javascript to work.

I was really delighted to see this. Then I saw the sign ups and realized you guys are not usable for my project :&lt;
 import binascii string = "string" binascii.b2a_base64(string) # outputs an error due to non byte string Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str' # try with byte string string = b'string' encoded = binascii.b2a_base64(string) # encoded is b'c3RyaW5n\n' decoded = encoded.decode('utf-8') # decoded is 'c3RyaW5n' I didn't specifically look at fernet but usually when I encounter this error it's due to not handling encoding decoding and byte or b'strings' correctly. Maybe some one else can chime in if it's something else. Good luck!
Become an Engineer! They need programming skills as part of their job, and you get to make stuff.
We will charge a subscription fee for using it. We'll post info about pricing soon. As for DataNitro - I can think of a few differences: * With Gridarrow multiple Excel sheets can connect to the same script and use the same data. That's not possible with DataNitro unless you somehow ensure everyone uses the same script and updates it at the same time * With Gridarrow you do the heavy lifting like data gathering and preprocessing outside the spreadsheets which makes them lighter and simpler * This also means that you can separate the data processing from data consumers. Say - your analysts don't have to know Python to be able to use it. They just connect to the script prepared by someone else (your IT for example) and have access to real-time stream of data they can work on. [edit] formatting
Glad you like it! The Gridarrow scripts are not embedded in any way into your Excel files. They run on the server and your spreadsheet receives the data using native C# plugin so there's no risk of corrupting the file.
Hey /u/LazyCraneOperator I'd be very interested in helping you and your team test this out/expand! Over the last few weeks I've been writing a very similar program, also in Python, specifically for real-time social media data extraction. I requested an invite, but only received an e-mail saying that I'd have to wait for the launch. Look forward to hearing from you! 
Hi! Check [my comment below](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/6u9psy/stream_realtime_data_into_excel_with_python/dlsevns/) on some differences between Gridarrow and DataNitro
Can you grab only free info online or do you for example have access to some data like Bloomberg?
Hi /u/nocalc. Sorry to hear that. Could you tell us why? Maybe we can help somehow. Feel free to pm me or drop me a line at greg@gridarrow.com
Hi! Sounds interesting. Please pm me or drop me a line at greg@gridarrow.com, we'll talk
We don't have or provide access to services like Bloomberg. You'd need to arrange the access yourself. But when you do you can use their Python API within your Gridarrow scripts and stream the data to Excel.
&gt; P.S. Check out: Programming Interviews Exposed: Secrets to Landing Your Next Job. Clickbaiting much? XD
I can't really speak to where pipy is hosted, etc., but I can say that you can't really blindly trust the packages. They're not really vetted. You'll have take the responsibility upon yourself to decide which packages to trust and install. You can do this by looking at source, looking at commit history, looking at what individuals/companies back it, assuming that this is already implicitly being taken care of by "community policing". But (as always) at the end of the day it's really on you.
ACH has a long period (60days) during which the customer can state the payment was not authorised. In this case the merchant (you) will face the full value of the losses. There is a shorter (4 day) period during which you can receive a return due to insufficient funds or other account related issues. Again you would in this case face the full value of any losses. For these two reasons it's generally a good idea to make sure the account number is owned by the customer and this is value Plaid offers. You will almost certainly find banks that are willing to process without plaid but they will be keen to understand how you would manage losses. This page has a link to a great overview of ach http://engineering.gusto.com/how-ach-works-a-developer-perspective-part-1/ I searched online for "merchant ach services" and there were a number of companies that offer just the processing. However it's a very old payment mechanism and there are probably more issues with the actual end to end operational processes as there is with the actual file processing, so it's worth working with businesses that try and remove as much friction as you can. 
In my case I do. I have large data structures that I only want to read and construct once, and then share between all worker processes. With threads this would be simple as the object could be shared, but with MP it goes slower and involves more code to construct the object on each process. &gt; but it's also not really any worse, In this case, it is, since other languages allow me to share my data structures between threads and do parallell processing on it. Python doesn't, and it is sometimes a pain. I still prefer Python over any other language I've used, and it is what I use as long as the requirements fit. But let's not pretend that the GIL is not a real problem that would be *very* nice to solve.
I recall that it's actually just barely supported by a few people in their spare time. Pretty amazing considering how important it is.
Ah
I love Rundeck http://rundeck.org. It provides a super slick web ui. It is a Java app, but it is simple to install. Another option is Jenkins. 
Good question :) Because the Transloadit Python SDK is trying to cover as many users as possible, who are interested in the service, we decided to favor support for Python 2, which lacks support for asyncio. This way we support both Python 2 and 3 by leaving out some of python 3 exclusive features. There is an alternative as this https://github.com/haypo/trollius, but it seems to deprecated as of now https://trollius.readthedocs.io/deprecated.html#deprecated Support for wheels is certainly necessary, and would be added on the next iteration :)
Interesting. So can I use these cloud hosted scripts to access another computer's data so that Excel from some other computers can retrieve data from it?
Uploading your own packages is absurdly simple - and that means you can't trust any of them without external evidence or inspection.
That could be one of the use cases, yes.
PyPi is owned by the [Python Packaging Authority](https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/). I believe that it's not so much maintained as completely revamped via the [Warehouse project](https://warehouse.pypa.io/).
A well known troll, just ignore it.
You're using the `socket` module, which means your code is not actually async. Check out https://github.com/saghul/aiodns for async host lookup.
&gt; we decided to favor support for Python 2 As it's 2017-08-18 09:52 BST that has to be one of the dumbest decisions ever made.
How this compares with asyncio pytest plugin?
The current PyPI code is hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/pypa/pypi-legacy), as is the in-development project to replace it, [Warehouse](https://github.com/pypa/warehouse).
Great. I'll try it out soon. Thanks!
Why does this need to be a web service?
You should use https://pypi.python.org/pypi/txaio it lets python 2/3 apps support asyncio
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*.

Will re-phrase the question. 
I'm not sure why you are of the opinion, but maybe the word "favor" was a bit misleading. I basically meant that we are trying to bag support for both python 2, and python 3 users. It'll be a bummer to leave one of both out of the mix.
~~I don't think this is what OP was asking for. The question was not who is responsible for the packages, but rather about PyPI *itself*. Where is it hosted? Who maintains it?~~ Nevermind... me no good read.
Looks good, yes. Much appreciated! Would be heavily considered for the next iteration. :)
It's hard not to recommend data science as a career path over web development. It seems to be where your skills lie, and researcher -&gt; data scientist seems to be a common career move. A science PhD will be more more recognised by employers looking for Data Science too. There may be more jobs in Web Development, but I would guess the demand relative to supply of data scientists is higher. Also, the renumeration, on average would appear to be ~~much~~ better on average: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#salary Ultimately, you have to go with what you would enjoy doing on a day to day. If you can't imagine wrangling large data sets, building correlations and models, etc. then of course don't go for Data Science. If, however, you think (like I do) that that sounds more like play than work, Data Science could be the career for you.
I've taken the liberty to copy this into [a gist](https://gist.github.com/exhuma/442185e7c370c18e8f82ebab4f32eb34) and make some little changes. Having it in a gist makes it easier to follow the changes. Primarily using a catchall exception without keeping *some* access to the traceback irked me. Trust me, you **never** want to silence a catchall exception! Using `logging` makes this really easy, and the first change shows an example how to log tracebacks, even with a low severity like `DEBUG` using the `exc_info` flag. I've got to run now, but I have a few other things in mind to change. But first the most important question: *Do you have the possibility to run this on Python 3? If yes, which version exactly?* Or are you stuck with Python 2? Link to gist history: https://gist.github.com/exhuma/442185e7c370c18e8f82ebab4f32eb34/revisions
Yes, have considered celery. But was looking for more better options.
yes it was the adblocker
You can also use the Keras library to build an MLP. Their GitHub repo has a lot of examples.
Last time I checked Rackspace was providing hosting, though that may have changed post-acquisition.
As far as I know (I tested recent version from pypi) `pytest.mark.asyncio`can't be used with `unittest.TestCase`. Unless you use a different TestCase implementation (supporting fixture injection) you won't benefit from that pytest extension. More info http://jacobbridges.github.io/post/unit-testing-with-asyncio/
Do you read every line of code of every package you install?
Not every transformation can be adequately represented with a (finite order) polynomial. Since one coordinate base is spherical coordinates, the transformation is most likely something involving trigonometric functions. What do you need this for/how do you want to use the transformation? Can you generate an arbitrary number of coordinates in both bases to evaluate?
And every other program, too. "Nothing to see here, folks. Click agree and move along."
I want to note that while your comment seems to hint at a large project/authority, almost all of the actual support and maintenance of pypi and related projects rests squarely on the shoulders of *[Donald Stufft](https://caremad.io/about/)* (@dstufft) and *Ernest Durbin* (@EWDurbin) for the pypi ops. See Donald's [Powering the Python Package Index](https://caremad.io/posts/2016/05/powering-pypi/) and [Hire Me](https://caremad.io/posts/2016/10/hire-me/) for excerpts.
I just checked on an ubuntu trusty server but it still has 2 as its default python: $ python --version Python 2.7.10 aren't there many platforms out there that still have this too? And so wouldn't we be increasing our compatibility and potential audience if we supported both versions, even in 2017? honest question.
By whose*
No, of course not. That's why I said external evidence - e.g. popular packages that have a proper release process and are widely used. I do often read the source for useful-looking small ones though.
Donald now works for AWS and they allow him to spend two work days a week on pypi and related. He used to work for (=get paid by) Hewlett Packard where he could spend the whole week on open source (!!). 
Donald Stufft goes into depth in this in the [Talk Python to me podcast episode 64](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/64/inside-the-python-package-index)
No. Whose = ownership. Example: Whose cat is this? By whose authority can you do this? Whom = who when used as an object of a sentence. Example: Whom do I give this to? (whom is the object of the verb "give") Who's = shortening of 2 words like "who is". Example: Who's coming with me? Who = subject of the sentence. Example: Who did this? His example: "By ___ is it hosted?". The blank is object ~~of the verb host~~, so he's actually correct.
Usually you;d edit the title and add necessary information so people can understand what and why you posted.
Hey, thanks. Yeah I checked Lynda out and this course is awesome.
My goal is to be able to convert the proprietary coordinates to lat/long, and the opposite, from Python, without having to use the closed API. I can generate as much data as I want from within the API, and already created huge data sets while trying to crack this nut.
Thanks! Why is sockets not async, but pycares is?
WHAT? It's COMPLETELY unethical. Should I be allowed to come into your house and use the stove in your kitchen, just because the door is poorly locked? If the endpoint is being used and circumvents the AAA - even if poorly implemented - then it's a gap / vulnerability that OP needs to tell the company about. EDIT: clarity
I've used CFFI to hook C code I was writing into a pytest-based test suite. There are some issues that require care (I'm sure that my tests leak some memory due to they way python allocates and releases objects vs the C way, but that's on me) but the simplicity of blasting a C function with a matrix of parameters created in python is a real pleasure. 
You could try [eureqa](http://www.nutonian.com/products/eureqa-desktop/register/). I never had any real use use case to try it, but at least it works well on toy problem.
Replaced `multiprocessing.dummy.Pool` with a `ThreadPoolExecutor` in the latest revision of the above gist which has a much cleaner API.
The [Let's Talk Python podcast](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/64/inside-the-python-package-index) with him is also a great listen if you're wanting a broad understanding of the project.
Well, without having any idea how that transformation works it's a bit difficult to answer. I guess my approach would be: sample the globe in lat/long. If you care about speed you may want to sample in a uniform manner (just sampling lat/long with equal spacing will result in points that are concentrated at the globes), otherwise just throw more samples at the problem. Then generate the other coordinate set from that. This will then basically be a lookup table. If you want to transform a point from one system to the other, find the samples closest to the one you want to transform (use a euclidean distance, if the transformation is not completely weird that should be good enough). Then use a linear interpolation between those points to find the target coordinates to the one you want to transform. Essentially this is also a polynomial interpolation, but you only apply it locally and can thus use a lower order (while also achieving higher accuracy). I can't say how well this will perform since I don't really know what you are dealing with, but it should yield decent results if the proprietary system is reasonable.
also asked was: &gt; How can I trust what packages come out when I type install? and the answer is: 'you can't'.
What about smaller libraries that are used by larger ones? e.g, beautifulsoup uses html5lib, which has a horrible release process (just [look](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/html5lib) at how they do versioning)
Oh snap. I missed that.
Love this interactive format!
Look at `scipy.interpolate`. It gives you `RectBivariateSpline`and `RectSphereBivariateSpline`. One of these should do what you want. Even if they don't, another part of the package should cover you.
That gif is straight from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes).
**Sieve of Eratosthenes** In mathematics, the sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple, ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit. It does so by iteratively marking as composite (i.e., not prime) the multiples of each prime, starting with the first prime number, 2. The multiples of a given prime are generated as a sequence of numbers starting from that prime, with constant difference between them that is equal to that prime. This is the sieve's key distinction from using trial division to sequentially test each candidate number for divisibility by each prime. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.24
There are a few advantages of having this as a service: 1) With a web-service, there's the ability to integrate the functionality into any application that talks HTTP, not just Python programs. 2) Separating the functionality into an independently deployable unit makes it possible to separate MeCab's resource usage from your application logic's requirements. The tokenizer needs quite a bit of memory so it'll likely have different hardware and scaling characteristics than the application code that calls it.
Did you create the database? i.e. try running `python manage,py migrate` and `python manage.py makemigrations`
Thank you, I'll give that a try !
Me too. I just want a background task.
Thanks, I'll try soon as I get home !
Thank you, those caught my eyes earlier today while skimming the doc, but the sheer amount of different transformations and my total lack of understanding of even the most basics of associated concepts landed me here =)
For posterity: it is currently not Python 3 compatible. However, I have found that Miguel Grinberg, in his [online Microblog tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-x-full-text-search), has a link to a fork which has the appropriate edits. If you are having difficulty with flask-whooshalchemy Python 3 compatibility, try this: $ flask/bin/pip uninstall flask-whooshalchemy $ flask/bin/pip install git+git://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flask-whooshalchemy.git
That is a poor analogy because my stove isn't intended to be accessed by others. Their API is.
If it's open source then PyQt is great, but if it's not then you need to pay for a license. PyGObject (Gtk) is great too, but has a lot less tutorials available. If you can get it running (I can't, so I can't say what it's like) Kivy looks great. Tkinter is fine if it's a small project but the lack of GUI designer sucks. Basically anything will work, so flip a coin/roll a dice if you have to!
Good data scientists are currently in ~~very~~ *extremely* high demand, command higher salaries, and IMO have a much better future outlook than the thousands of web devs churning through "code bootcamps". Especially if you're talking about Python specifically, where it's web presence is rapidly losing market share, but it remains very strong in data science. For data science you're golden if you're competent in stats, calculus, linear algebra, and machine learning algorithms. Don't sell yourself short, there is such a lack of talent supply you can get your foot in the door if you're halfway competent and sound like you understand the basics behind stats/calc 101 type math. Teams typically care more about fundamentals than what tools you use, but Python, numpy, Tensorflow, theano, sklearn, sci-py are all very popular tools in the field. Ability to grok scientific papers is a *huge* advantage in data science, since new research comes out almost daily and can be applied immediately to many problems.
One super-duper quick-and-dirty solution is to add a tiny web framework (I'm partial to Bottle), pop open a web browser, and just use a localhost web interface as your GUI.
This program I’m making is a gift of sorts to a teacher for their in class usage. Would I be able to port what I have running at home to her classroom by using this method?
You should search /r/python for GUI, as this comes up every week or so. * Flask can be great for really quickly making a webui * REMI works really well and is a webui but more tuned to classic GUI building * PyQT5 / PySide can make native-ish GUIs and you get QTDesigner to help out, just check to see if the license is compatible with what you want to do * Beeware Toga seems to be coming along and gives actual native GUI that's cross platform, though of course you can never make something truly cross platform that will feel completely native without writing slightly different looking GUIs for each platform. * PyGTK+ is available * WXPython is also available, and finally apparently getting Python3 and modern WX library support. Me, for small scripts, I just go for Flask serving a little REST API and make a small web based client for it in JS, mostly by hand for the smallest projects, though I kind of like VueJS, and React is also popular.
One way to discover new python blogs is to subscribe python newsletters. check http://importpython.com/newsletter/
I'll start by applauding u/chriddyp on the great work on Dash. Does anybody know if there will be added more standard core components such as gauges, bars and status lights / dots. I know all of the can be made as plots, so that's a hack to start with, but i would be a great addon the Dash. Aslo: Has anybody found a more comprehensive reference to the API than the user guide?
I probably wouldn't have used a list for its implementation. This is where Numpy truly shines!
I'm not familiar with pycares. But in general, everything in the standard library (outside of the asyncio module) and most third party libraries are going to be blocking. So if you want to do async coding, you have to be careful to choose async libraries and apis.
But why storing the data on github?
Consider looking into CFFI. I used it heavily to test algorithms written for a embedded system. It's very easy generate the bindings via makefile as you can (almost) directly use the header files.
I used TK and for my first small GUI programme it was surprisingly easy. The hardest thing was making the fonts do what I wanted, and I still don't understand that, but asides from that it looked pretty good. The alternative, if it really is a small programme, and depending on who your teacher is, is to make a CLI instead. I [Click](http://click.pocoo.org) was amazing when I just wanted to make a quick, intuitive (to a unix user) interface to my app.
Even if Numpy isn't available and you do need to use a list, you can use list slice assignment to dramatically speed up the sieve (as I learned from having done a good number of CodeWars and Project Euler problems). https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2068372/fastest-way-to-list-all-primes-below-n
That's a great reply, thank you. I didn't realize the math involved, but I have taken at least descriptive stats, calculus, and linear algebra but it was a *long* time ago (&gt;20yrs) and to say I need a brush up is an understatement (it may just be the case that I've completely forgotten almost all of it). But I used basic statistics like t-tests and whatnot in my research, of course, and I actually feel more comfortable with math generally (actually tutored ACT math recently, though that's so low level), so perhaps I could pick it back up. And yes, I feel very comfortable reading scientific papers (obviously, in my field the most, but I can branch out somewhat and the main blockers in grokking papers outside of my field are just whether I know enough of the jargon/concepts of that other field). 
What OS? 
Ubuntu and mac
I wanted to store it somewhere safe (backed up). I do not use Dropbox and Gdrive with Python was not super comfortable.
There is 2 new guys in my fantasy football league and I have the honor of being league commissioner. The draft order is usually based on the last years results, but the new guy's positions in the draft will be based on a random number. (To non-football nerds: I run the league and every year you take turns picking players. I want to fairly determine their spot.) I am using this as a chance to practice and test out my skills in python. I want to make something that assigns a random number to one guy, then picks another random number excluding the last guys number. Pretty easy but for a noob like be its a good test of syntax and gives me a fun way to practice. This is for my family league. For my friends, we are doing it based on the results of a beer pong competition. I am worried that not everyone will be moved into their dorms by the draft day, so I want an alternate version of this set up for that. The tricky part is the number of people might change, some people might flake on the pong game, and I will be fairly drunk. To deal with this, I want to build something that will first ask for a few inputs: the number of people in the league, and the names of the people who didn't get placement determined by the pong game. Then it will randomly assign them places. The order will be: 1st: Winner of pong 2nd: Second place of pong ect. ect. xth: First chosen by my python code (x+1)th: Second chosen by my python code ect. ect. I will have my laptop to host the draft from so I can run something real quick from it. It has to work well and be easy to use while hammered. (that's how we draft)
For ubuntu: Right click on the file &gt; properties &gt; permissions &gt; check the box "allow executing this file as a program". You could do that from the command line with this command: chmod +x file_name.py Then you need to have a shebang as the first line of the file. Like this: #!/usr/bin/env python3 Remove the "3" if you want to run in python2. I don't know about mac, but it's probably similar. --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython.

I'm pretty sure what you're doing isn't possible. What function are you trying to implement? Post the signature and intent?
Continuing to learn Python daily. Learning Click module by creating a CLI to-do app and seeing how far I can push it with integrating into other list services. Also going to build a flask app on my raspberry pi to use the same DB and have a nice, modern interface. It's a simple project that I can expand on and learn a lot of concepts. It's alot of reinventing the wheel but I have some great concepts that I'm going to implement and I'm learning loads along the way. 
Case in point I recently found: https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&amp;term=Visa&amp;submit=search Some guy forked a bunch of projects, prefixed them with 'hedgehog-' and released them. They actually show up higher in the search than the actual packages. For now it looks like he's changed nothing, yet.
Yeah, your playlist history and weather information is something you need to be careful of. Don't want to lose that stuff.
The lines above it are indented out so end the `if` block, so you can't have an `elif` there. 
deleted
`elif` must come after an indented block. Move lines 34 and 35 to line 37 and indent them. It's also a spelling error. --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython.

You have the right idea, you just need to convert the integer to a str and add another `+`: print("Alex will draft in the" + str(Alex) + "position") Or, you can use string formatting to do that automatically: print(f"Alex will draft in the {Alex} position") (assuming your python is up to date). 
Solved
The disk letter shouldn't matter, it's just installed in a different location. The part that you are missing is installing the module. I don't know if on Windows you have access to `pip` but if yes you just need to run `pip install pytube`
Thanks for help and will reformulate my question. 
Better than bunch of stupid ads taking up half of the screen. It's an actually really good book and I really do recommend it. Please let me know if you'd like a paid subscription and I'd be happy to remove the ads.
Cool, thank you for taking the time to do that. I'll have to test it with Python 2 (which I am currently stuck with at work), but I'll definitely link to your gist from my post.
If you're really interested in robotics I recommend installing ROS, and working through the tutorials. The turtlebot simulator is included in the most recent release 'Kinetic Kane'. http://wiki.ros.org
What are you using to code in? I'm using IDLE and it's ugly :( I need something nicer
PyCharm is the go-to for Python, it also has a vim plugin if that's your thing.
I would echo most of the people here and say go for the Data Science route. In fact you likely have a ton of Data Science skills but you just don't know it yet. In your PhD you already did data wrangling (rejecting outliers and figuring out ways to fill in missing pieces of data). You also did a ton of stats (was the thing I observed statistically significant) and likely came up with models (does this hypothesis match my previous data and are the predictions reasonable for the future). As someone who did the transition from hard science to python dev (and have a bunch of friends who did the same), you are in good company and good luck in finding interesting work.
PyCharm... ok, thanks!
Sorry for not seeing reply, but yes. I'm not sure if you went ahead and followed bulletmark's advice, in which case fine, whatever you prefer. Again, my experience is coming from the Rasp Pi. Since my usage is very specific, I'm not sure how much it's going to help you out. Just trying to throw my 2 cents into it. But on the Pi, I would install using the terminal command: sudo apt-get install python3-pip From there you could use pip3 to install modules for Python 3, i.e.: pip3 install unicornhat Here's the link I used when getting pip3 up and going: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/software/python.md
Overall more reliable, aesthetics/build quality, don't have to buy a lot of antivirus protection and legally you can't run a virtual machine of MacOS on other OS. 
Linux is, on average, a bit more work than a Mac, because Apple can make sure that the operating system works nicely with the computers. There are also a lot of different options within Linux - which distro? which desktop? This can make life more complicated. There are now some vendors selling computers with Linux pre-installed and tested. Dell sells the XPS 13 Developer Edition with Ubuntu on. [System 76](https://system76.com/) is a company that only sells Linux computers. And there are others. They don't tend to be cheap, but if you want a new computer to run Linux with minimum hassle, they might be worth it. The way most people get Linux is to install it onto a computer which was sold with Windows. I'm using Fedora on a Dell business laptop. Hardware support is mostly pretty good, but there are still some things that can catch you out, so it's worth doing a bit of research on compatibility before you buy one.
Also: don't write your own payment processing systems. It's bad for your liability and your customers' security.
&gt; and people say that Linux and Mac are good OS to work with Python. Yeah; but TBH Windows is just as good (Edit: once you are set up, and Windows will require a lot more set up / installing / configuration). There was a time when programming worked better on Linux but nowadays programming tools on Windows are just as good. To learn programming any OS is just fine. As a professional, I would suggest you program on whatever platform you want your final code to run on. If you are writing software for servers (which generally run Linux) then use Linux. That said, I use Linux because I'm used to it and very comfortable, and I like the way it does everything better. This is the same reason you see people using Macs: they like Macs and the want to work in an environment they like. 
It is very nice, after a year of using Idel, i realized that i had not been using Python to the best of my abilities as soon as i used PyCharm.
thank you! Edit: Holy shit how did it know to but the "st" after the 1 to make it first, and the "nd" after the 2 to make it second? This just cut the code I had down by 80%
Windows has come a long way, but I'd hardly call it "just as good" at this stage. The tools are there on Windows, but they're still a huge pain to use. Unless you've got a preference for mousing around, of course. In the case of Python, especially, it's still not equal. Sure, the big, popular libraries wheel in without issue, but what if you want to use a less-popular library that does a neat thing? On Unix and Linux this (usually) just works. In Windows you might be in for a wild ride if the developer of said module can't be bothered.
I have a Mac for my programming work. It's adequate. The keyboard isn't the best, but it's pretty good. The touchpad actually works really well, which is something I've never been able to say about a Windows or Linux laptop. And it's Unix, so most of my Linux skills are just as valid here. But you know what really makes the Mac work for me? Battery life. For some reason (that probably has to do with the whole hardware/software from the same vendor phenomenon), Apple's laptops just run longer on the battery with REAL hardware in them. Sure, you can get a feather-light Windows machine that can just about get there on battery life, but you'll be doing it with 2 cores and a 12 inch screen. 2 cores feels like a straight jacket, these days. And battery life is just a struggle in Linux. It can be done, in theory, but you've really got to work for it. I've done it, but I don't know that I want to keep doing it.
OK, I'll agree that windows requires a lot more set up / installing. But once you have a proper shell, editor, compiler etc installed I don't think there is any difference. Unless of course you want to use a module that has been written specifically for Linux, and you are right; many modules that do a neat thing are written for Linux first, and only later made cross platform. 
I've yet to find a proper shell in Windows. There's the GNU tools for Windows, but you're stuck using the hobbled Command.com or PowerShell semantics. The Ubunto-on-WSL thing is neat, but it's not persistent, and the cracks become apparent quick. MSYS2 is REALLY nice, but you've got to remember what it really is. Trying to get your toolchain to play well with Windows libraries that aren't directly supported by MSYS2 is real tricky. Like you said, develop on the platform you plan to deploy for. I hear that Visual Studio's Python support is actually really nice. If the modules you need build fine in Visual Studio, then I see no reason to leave that space.
Great. If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
I disagree. The route he's accessing isn't an API. It's a route that their own website is using to conduct searches. I'm not saying that its well built or designed, but speaking strictly from an ethics perspective, OP went through the source of the website, found where the search was being POSTed, and started calling that directly. That's not what an API is. He's simply making a call that bypasses the 'front door'. I mean, if it's a published API that just sucks, that's one thing (ethics wise) and I'd agree with you. But in this case, I don't think it is :)
Do you have any project suggestions for me?
&gt; how did it know to but the "st" after the 1 to make it first, and the "nd" after the 2 to make it second? I'm amazed it did. Are the three lines above the only ones you're running? There are libraries for this but I'd be surprised if it was automatic.
What have you done so far?
Thanks for this! This blog is great!
Yeah that'll take a while.. I was thinking maybe you could solve this by creating a lookup table as you wander through, but it's just too much data. I'm leaning towards this being a math problem.
I've been using qgis to make maps, and it's a pain in the ass to use programmatically. You can't install it within a conda environment, so I have to spin up a vm. Then, there's a ton of setup you have to do to properly instantiate environment objects if you dont want to have to click through the GUI, and the docs are not very good. This looks much easier - definitely going to try it out.
Made a prime number finder, some hello world programs, simple calculator... not that much. I'm coming from C++ and Java, but I know the Python syntax ok. I don't know the use of ``::`` or ``[ ]``

Have you bought the book "Automate the Boring stuff with Python?" The teaching projects are really good
Nah, I don't have any money (being 15) :( I'll try and find a PDF
Hi, I have recently switched from mac to linux. Now im using lenovo t560 with fedora 26. While mac is really great, i did a switch for couple of reasons, main among them is the ability to upgrade hardware (RAM, disk, cpu).. AND, if it gets broken, components are not soldered to MB, so in theory its easier and cheaper to replace. For example i have put additional 8GB of ram for total 16.. in year or so i may even put 32GB (i extensively use kvm to spin many VM). Second thing is the software, somehow with linux i have the feeling im just 'safer'. In most cases i _know_ what every app or service that's started is doing and working.. cant say same for mac, but this is my opinion, most of the 'pros' out there are using macs, so it should not be big concern for you i guess. For python, i think both OS are good enough, im not sure you will 'feel' any difference really.. if you use pycharm thats going to be same experience on both platforms. Hope this helps ;) 
It's out there for free
Not everyone uses OSX, I'm running Ubuntu. Ideally I would be running Ubuntu on Dell XPS 13 developer edition. (assuming a laptop). Why people gets macs is beyond me. This is for my day job and personal machine.
You didn't specify what you are going to program, but in my experience Windows is also adequate for python programming. You can also install VirtualBox and have Linux VMs there, of course. I installed python 3.6 from windows binaries, and use Visual Studio Code + Python for VSCode extension, and so far everything works fine, I install python modules via pip as usual, also pylint and debugging works. So if you want to save money, you can as well buy cheaper laptop and install windows or linux there.
I gave an example not an exhaustive list. What are you trying to say?
I do my dev work on a Mac, running through my KVM setup. It’s great. Turn on, open PyCharm/whatever, start working. The end. I have other boxes for other tasks, but for banging out code (or research), Mac works for me. 
I get that you're just messing around but this isn't that useful. My play history is already stored on Spotify. If you could do something useful like use machine learning to suggest genres based on the way weather that would be kind of cool.

Awesome, looking forward to it!
Your implementation should check whether the current number is prime before running the inner loop. This implementation pointlessly eliminates multiples of non-primes like 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 etc. Also, since python booleans are a subclass of integers, you might as well use a list of integers instead of booleans to avoid the call to enumerate. Here's an implementation that does just that: def prime_sieve(upto): # Start by making a list of candidate primes, which is all numbers upto # the given maximum. Next, this function is going to zero out all numbers # in the list that have been determined as not prime. Finally, we will # return those numbers that have not been zeroed out. candidates = list(range(upto+1)) # First off, 1 is not prime, by definition candidates[1] = 0 # Now, we will walk through the list. Every time we encounter an item # that is not zero, we know it is a prime and we will then zero out all # its multiples, starting from its square. These are not primes because # they are divisible by the current number. # The first number we will encounter is 2, so then we will zero out # 4,6,8,10,etc. Next up we will encounter 3, so we zero out 9,12,15,etc. # Note that we do not need to zero out 6 here, as that is a multiple of # 2 and has therefore been zeroed already. That is why we're starting at # 3x3, as any smaller multiple of 3 also has a smaller divisor. # Next, the entry at 4 has been zeroed, so the next non-zero we will # encounter is 5, and then 7, then 11, then 13, etc. for candidate in candidates: # if this is zero, it has been zeroed out as the multiple of an # earlier number and is not prime, so continue to the next candidate if candidate == 0: continue # Because the zeroing starts at the square of the candidate, we're # done when we've passed the square root of the maximum. # We can stop the loop immediately now. if candidate**2 &gt; upto: break # walk through all the multiples of this candidate, starting at its # square and ending at the maximum of the list for multiple in range(candidate**2, upto+1, candidate): candidates[multiple] = 0 # when the loop is done, return all numbers that have not been zeroed by # using a list comprehension that filters out the zeroes. return [num for num in candidates if num &gt; 0] 
You have a proprietary way to represent coordinates? Why don't you just read the theory document on your coordinates and figure out how to convert to something standard? For the precision that you require, you're probably not going to get it with a polynomial. You're representing a series of sines and cosines, which is not easy.

IF you provide proper attribution. The file is CC BY-SA 3.0. I can find absolutely no hint to its source on the article linked here. And even if the license didn't strictly require it that's just common courtesy.
It was in the Python Weekly newsletter. Though it did a good job explaining a tricky concept. 
Looks cool. Commenting so I can find this later.
This is a co op position. Plus I learned a lot of networking in my previous co op. So it's just learning a lot of automation tools, SQL, and Python. 
Single line version: primes = [2] + sorted(set(xrange(3,max,2)) - { x for step in xrange(3, int(max**0.5) + 1, 2) if step %3 or step==3 for x in xrange(step * 3, max, step * 2)} ) Explanation here: http://www.technobabelfish.com/2014/06/single-line-prime-numbers-in-python.html I've also implemented the sieve on a c64: https://www.reddit.com/r/c64/comments/3iozpg/c64_prime_sieve_optimized/ 
This needs an answer. 
&gt; I've seen a few examples on github but I have no way to know how good they are. And Backblaze has their b2 client, but no examples on using it as a library. If you take a look at their command line program, they use their b2 library. It's really an example on how to use b2. When I was looking into it, it was the only source I could find that was useful.
No offense but a co op and a developer position aren't the same, at all. Usually a developer has programmed for years and years and knows the ins and outs of the entire language. 
/r/learnpython is the right sub for this. 
Discovering about working, complexities and difference between Python's coroutines and Golang's goroutine. I think I will write a blog on that too.

Yea I understand. Why can't you be a network automation developer student? 
It really doesn't matter, except if you have a toolset (editor) or workflow preference, that isn't available on the others. I personally would say stick with what is comfortable, because you don't want to eat up an evening troubleshooting an operating system problem when you have deadlines. Just my 2 cents though!
Cool, thanks for sharing
Thanks! I didn't realize they had "published" it as well
&gt; Edit: Holy shit how did it know to but the "st" after the 1 to make it first, and the "nd" after the 2 to make it second? This just cut the code I had down by 80% There is no way that the code shown can do that. What did you actually run? 
That's a bummer. It's a typesafe pattern matching function for a particular union. For simplicity we'll say it is: def match(operand: Union[V, L], variable_case: Callable[[V], T], literal_case: Callable[[L], T]) -&gt; T: if isinstance(operand, V): return variable_case(operand) if isinstance(operand, L): return literal_case(operand) V and L need to be consistent for a system of operands, but it seems surprisingly hard to do this with Python's type system. In particular, it looks like the Python developers went out of their way to preclude switching on type cars, but it's not clear to me why.
That speed increase is impressive. However it could be noted, that if you do complex number formatting, you get: &gt;&gt;&gt; a = 1/6 &gt;&gt;&gt; b = 2.1 &gt;&gt;&gt; %timeit f'{a:+.2f} + {b} = {a + b:+.2f}' 1.63 µs ± 14.2 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each) &gt;&gt;&gt; %timeit '{:+.2f} + {} = {:+.2f}'.format(a, b, a+b) 1.48 µs ± 18 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each) That is, f-strings are slightly worse here though the string processing part is dwarfed by the number formatting part.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrapie
**Scrapie** Scrapie is a fatal, degenerative disease that affects the nervous systems of sheep and goats. It is one of several transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), which are related to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or "mad cow disease") and chronic wasting disease of deer. Like other spongiform encephalopathies, scrapie is caused by a prion. Scrapie has been known since 1732, and does not appear to be transmissible to humans. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.24

One quick solution is to make a .bat file with your favorite text editor, and just put this in there: python your_script.py
Python modules are packaged and distributed with dependency info that pip can use to pull in dependencies. I would start with using a virtualenv and a subprocess that securely downloads a wheel or egg file and uses a subprocess to run pip. If that all runs ok, try importing the module. Wheel files can do what you want but including dependencies doesn't sound manageable; how will you ever incrementally upgrade?

That is an idea but I am afraid of using a undocumented API of sorts. I may end up just using their library from subprocess depending on whether that would work (since you need to authorize, etc).

Yep. The stack I use is a mix of python and javascript. I use numpy/pandas, plotly, flask, socketio, vuejs, and cesiumjs. Lately though I've been using plotly dash for quick throwaway things. 
Good article. I like that it actually does some behind the scenes analysis. Too often have I been disappointed by similar titles followed by a mundane tutorial barely covering the basic uses. The performance difference is impressive.
Sure, but who cares, since pytest is most used testing framework? Or i didn't get your question.
I've made some updates. How about now?

Please, learn the proper terms before attempting to teach Python. What you call "array" or "list" is a tuple. Tuples are immutable containers; lists are mutable containers. Arrays are not builtin containers, and are highly specialized. https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html
That's a data standard called JSON. Python has a built-in `json` module that can transform it into a dictionary. --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using.

Thank you for your quick answer and for letting me know this other subreddit, seems like a goldmine of information for beginners.
Have you looked at any provenance management tools? They sort of do this stuff and more.
I know to run script with terminal but want alternative run script whitout terminal 👍🏾
OSX is basically FreeBSD/Unix with a nice friendly GUI on top, it's POSIX compliant so many tools written for Linux/Unix can be compiled to run on OSX. It comes with a terminal and performs a large set of Linux commands out of the box. You can also install HomeBrew which is basically APT/DNF for OSX. So basically it's recommended as it has most of the power and tools Linux has for developing, but comes in a very easy to use package so that the user doesn't have to tinker with the OS itself all the time and can get right to programming. OSX also offers the user much longer time on battery power and the hardware itself is powerful enough for development so the user doesn't have to worry about buying something under powered or a piece of junk with a shitty keyboard etc.... The user knows they are getting quality parts. Myself when it's time to upgrade I just buy a used Macbook and install Linux on it so I get the best of both options, usually the amount I pay still nets me better then the cheap Acer at the store can offer at that price. My used Macbook nets me 9 hours on battery and it's 6 years old! Another option is building a Hackintosh, in that case you basically buy standard PC parts that are compatible with OSX and install it on that to save money. And yes I heavily recommend OSX and a Macbook Pro or Hackintosh for developing, stay far far far away from Windows 10...
i am hoping they improve when they get to python 3 the osgeo version has pip which allows ou to install local packages.
Yes. I did that. Also used "manage.py check" command and that too didn't find any problems. 
That feels like a bug. I wonder what the difference is? Under the hood both should be calling `__format__` it's just when it gets called.
I hadn't heard the term. Thanks! These seem interesting. Sumatra seems the best for my workflow so far, but I've only scratched the surface, and it might be too constraining. https://pythonhosted.org/Sumatra/

If by database you mean an SQL database, then sure, you can use SQL workbench or something but you'll need access to the database server itself. Otherwise, you'll probably have to build something called a crawler or a scraper. You should be able to manipulate what page you go to using the URL (ie look for something like ?page=7 or something in the URL) so you can get the plain HTML of each page using python, and manipulate the string to get the information you need and feed it into a spreadsheet or something. For me, having done it before, it would probably take like an hour or so, but if you don't have a coding background, it's not going to be a quick fix. Sorry bud.
This is awesome! IDEs often have this capability, but with only timeit in notebooks, I find myself having to drop back to an IDE more than I'd like for speed optimizations.
I've been throwing together some programs using csv files and selenium to gather and sort some data for work. I want to try to move those over to a quicker webdriver &amp; scraper and xls writing along with a good GUI interface if possible. Tkinter has worked great, but damn is it ugly.
Maybe an artifact of running it in the repl. 
There is no documentation whatsoever. I'm stuck using raw data to try and find the best fitting function, unfortunately...
That's highly unlikely. You may need to request it, but it's there if you're using a proprietary format.
I'm an econ major going into my third year. Currently, I am creating an agent based model for examining stock trading strategies on a very simple scale(literally take the derivative over x days to decide whether to buy or sell) to find the optimum number of days in order to maximize profit(depending on the market type). I don't think it's going to yield any significant information because of how simple the strategies are but it's just something to help me learn more about the object oriented side of programming

Someone at work gave a demo of [vistrails](https://www.vistrails.org/index.php/Main_Page). The way they described is what you said in the motivation section of your README on github.
Descartes Labs has a clean, pythonic API for various satellites.
I saw a talk about [Sacred from SciPy 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqg7RO0o1OE). It's not as fully featured as Sumatra, but it might work better for your purposes if your experiments are in Python? If not, there were a few other alternatives mentioned at the end, including Sumatra.
Fair enough. I'm really just answering the OPs question - the process to get your package on PyPi is very simple and anyone can do it in five minutes, so if these sorts of things bother oneself then it might pay to understand that you could be running bad code, so take some care appropriate to your appetite for risk.
yeah, will check this
Please add a more static picture, it's hard to make out what the heat map does in the gif.
It's a shame they cost more when used with logging. The logging API has support for conditionally calling `format()` based on current log level but as far as I can tell there's nothing similar to avoid f-string interpolation.
Personally, I think the demo gif is slow enough but the snapshot will only add to the understanding as you pointed out. Hence added the same as a link underneath the demo gif. Here is the snapshot link http://i.imgur.com/isxRNV0.png Enjoy!
Nice article, I will try to replicate it using an ESP8266, thanks!
Upvoted. I commented on the [x-post](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/6un9e7/ipython_magic_command_to_profile_and_view_your/) in /r/programming.
Glad to be of help. Use it to the full extent and let me know how can I make it can be made better.
Thanks, I have couple of them home and I made a fatal mistake powering them with 5V :) It took me three times to notice that I am an idiot :)))))) Maybe you could post the code in the comment if you want to.
There is YAML support now.
For anyone reading this in the future, here's the follow up Github issue: https://github.com/takluyver/pynsist/issues/124 Spoiler alert: we found out how to make it work. :-)
Wait a minute! so f-Strings behave just like eval? &gt;&gt;&gt;some_variable = 'I exist' &gt;&gt;&gt;def security_breach(something): &gt;&gt;&gt; global some_variable &gt;&gt;&gt; del some_variable &gt;&gt;&gt; return something &gt;&gt;&gt;f'{security_breach('Hey')}' 'Hey' &gt;&gt;&gt;some_variable Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; NameError: name 'some_variable' is not defined ....mmmmh that does not seems good.
Maybe you should not put to much pressure on you for choosing a laptop for programming. You don't need a high performance laptop for programming, even if you work with VM/Docker/LXC/others. You can be pretty fine with 4Gb of RAM and an average CPU. If you are going to use your computer a lot, you might want to focus your attention on: - Screen quality (to reduce eye fatigue) - Laptop weight (your back will thank you) - Battery life - Repairable (to avoid replacing the entire computer every 2/3 years) 
This is arguably since no data is provided. From the github search results, python code only, pytest ~990k, for "unittest.TestCase" 3M. Of course these results are flawed. But the discussion - "I'm using pytest, so everybody does", - "I am using standard TestCase implementation, so everybody should" - "I use both and they work like charm together", - "aiounitest work great with pytest as well", - "but pytest is a standard, only its extensions matter" - "the SO answers about asyncio test mention both pytest-async and the same as implementation of aiounitest" is highly flameable. I'm out, eot
For python development it mostly doesn't matter. Windows 10 now includes an adequate Linux subsystem. It works pretty well, so just use whatever runs best on your laptop.
Well, you are writing code are you not? Would be a shame if the code you wrote wouldn't be evaluated. It's not like a user can ever create an f-string. 
If I may ask what does this line do? b &gt;&gt;= 1
It shifts the bits of b by 1 position to the right 
This is super cool. Congrats!! I hope you post links of those entries on this sub. 
Making the last frame of the gif stay static for a couple of seconds longer than it takes to read the heatmap would be good. The first time I saw it, it disappeared just as my eyes were being drawn to it. GIMP can edit gifs as layers, the duration is in the layer name.
That's right, like already said, it's not possible for untrusted user input to be evaluated using the f-syntax. There are no "f-variables". The f-prefix is only applicable on *string literals*. Something like `f'{' + userinput + '}'` won't work either, because the f-prefix only applies to the string literal `'{'` where its used (and would in fact raise a syntax error in this case, bescause of the unclosed curly bracket).
Link? 😀
Which, for an integer, is equivalent to dividing it by two and rounding down - `b //= 2` in Python. The bit-shift operation may be more efficient, though I'd guess that it doesn't make much difference for Python code.
Methods that are absolutely needed: `get`, `set`, `remove`, iteration over keys and iteration over (key, value) pairs (depending on the back-end, iteration over keys can be much cheaper than iteration over (key, value) pairs, but iteration over (key, value) pairs can be much cheaper than iterating over keys and `get`ting each value separately). `BaseStorage` can then define `clear` as def clear(self): for key in self.keys(): self.remove(key) For storage implementations where there is a native `clear` that is much faster than removing each key separately, they can override `clear`, other implementations can keep the default `clear`. As for point 1), my point was moot, since users of your liberary can call `BaseStorage.register(MyStorage)`, even if it does not inherit from `BaseStorage`.
https://github.com/felix314159/website_update_check This is my code, read through the readme, I am currently implementing a feature where the script will log you in (I also need this for my uni results haha)
It wouldn't be seamless, because Python doesn't support macros. There would be solutions, for example: log(LOG_THIS and f'....') LOG_THIS and log(f'....') log(lambda: f'...') But nothing that would look like log(f'...') 
That is completely wrong. F-strings are code. They are not eval'd strings, they are _expressions_. Look at this code: `value = input()`. You can't get an f-string out of that. Sure, you can _use_ it in an f-string, but the contents of `value` are never evaluated. Try it.
&gt; When we use str.format(), the format function first needs to be looked up in the global scope. That is not true. If we use `format()`, _that_ has to be looked up in the global scope (actually the builtins, but Python checks the global scope first). But `str.format()` uses attribute lookup, as indicated by the LOAD_ATTR instruction.
This would have made my Bachelor thesis project so much less frustrating...

The real question is it can be used as a progress bar 😆
I'd love to see it, but you forgot the link?
Actually this project was inspired by that talk on sacred. I really like the idea of sacred, but I wanted something a little lighter. Also, sacred still feels pretty new, and I'm hesitant to trust new software with my experiments just yet (which is in no way a critique on sacred, I'm just paranoid and haven't done enough research on it yet).
sorry! included repo link
There isn't any publicly available. The people who wrote the function I'm interested in did not reply to my earlier request.
What I ended up doing was the following: 1. Obtain huge data sets for both latitude and longitude. 2. Compute a bunch of polynomials to the highest degree possible with `numpy.polyfit` and save them 3. Apply all polynomials to the source dataset, and compare the output to the output from the closed API 4. Select the best fitting polynomial based on the deviation This is still a rough approximation, but it's the best I can manage. Thank you all for your help ! =)
I think that you are putting the cart before the horse. As the previous comment pointed out, you will probably need scrape it and step through the pages. While this is a common task, it is non-trivial, and you'll need to understand some kind of programming/scripting language in order to get it to work. Otherwise, your best bet is to do it manually. You can get what you want by programming, or by doing it manually. If you want to do it by programming, you'll have to learn to program--at least a little bit. 
There's also the lprun magic, but OP's too looks prettier.
If only we had a profiler to find out.
I prefer using subplots to plot graphs, even when there is only one. That way you automatically have access to the axes and figure objects, and it makes setting titles and axis labels much neater in my opinion. fig, ax = plt.subplots() randnumbers = np.random.randn(1000) ax.hist(randnumbers) ax.set(title="My Histogram", xlabel="Value", ylabel="Frequency") http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.subplots
Yes, but it's a little bit more difficult to work with satellite data directly which is usually supplied in a raster format (like GeoTIFF) or in HDF-EOS. There is rather poor tooling for HDF-EOS in Python, but you can use [rasterio](https://mapbox.github.io/rasterio/) (which now has an xarray backend) for many things.
What would the bitshift do on python's big integers?
Same thing. They're encoded in the same way, just in 64 bits instead of 32. It should only stop working on floats. 
Thanks for comming again a month after initial post. At the moment i dont have a lot of spare time to work on the library, but when i have some extra time on my hands, i'll make sure to use the advice you've given. The original idea was to create a thin wrapper that would help to link any backend for the code to use as cache mechanism, so my plan was to not define an actual storage, but rather a part of it that is minimal and would do the job of linking it to the code. However im open to reconsideration. At the moment, base storage has `get`, `set`, and `remove`. Iteration over elements also sounds reasonable; `clear` method is not hard to implement as well (*thanks for code snippet btw*). I still, however, fail to understand your point `1)`. If you try to use some storage and you forgot to implement `remove`, you'll get a runtime error some time (and possibly **long** after) you start up your code. The current way does not cost you anything more than a stroke of code (`class MyStorage(Basestorage)`), but it will give you a error immediately when you try to start your program. At the moment, `BaseStorage` consists of nothing but 3 abstract methods, so it doesnt add anything you wouldnt want in your storage class. Can you, please, clear up the reasoning behind your original point? Thanks again. I'll work on an update when i get a chance. :)
I didn't mean a regular int, rather what python denotes by L. It's arbitrary-sized integer, big int I think they call it. I just wonder how it works internally.
Yeah, I know what you mean. A regular python int is 32 bits. A long int is 64 bits, using the same encoding, two's complement signed integers. So the shift operations work just the same As opposed to floating point numbers, which are a bit complicated and depend on the interpreter, but are IEEE single or double precision floating point numbers (sign bit, 8/16 exponent bits, 23/47 numeric bits). You can't use shift operations on a float. 
@stuaxo : There is a link right below the demo which has the snapshot link. Here it is if you missed it http://i.imgur.com/isxRNV0.png
&gt; Yeah, I know what you mean. A regular python int is 32 bits. A long int is 64 bits, using the same encoding, two's complement signed integers. I don't think you do. For example foo = 34494846812312438467612454354668434566231212345543359498321343215438547847895543814889640867 is a valid statement in python, foo being of type long. It supports all (I believe) operations that proper integer does. And is nowhere near 64-bits long.
Ooooohhhh I dun goofed. I didn't know python supported arbitrary precision without importing libraries for it. After a little reading, it seems they are implemented as arrays of ints, so I would guess that the same operations are supported. 
The only distribution that ships `python` as Python 3 is Arch Linux AFAIK. That does not make Python 2 preferred in others, but just avoids breaking scripts that are not specific about their Python version.
Don't quote me on it, but this may due to how f-strings are evaluated. Im not a C programmer, but I can usually figure out what code is doing. I was really interested in how they implemented it because I wanted to see if there was a way to extend it, but it basically uses several loops to first find the start and end of brackets and then goes back tk decide if it can be evaluated or should toss an error, then goes back and starts evaluation, and then goes back and applies formatting , though I THINK I missed a loop in there. At the time I at least had figured out how you could use f-strings and str.format within a string.

This isn't really the right sub-reddit you'd probably be better over at /r/AskElectronics. You'd need to describe your setup a bit more but half stepping means you'll require twice the number of steps for your sequence. So your sequence should be 8 different steps instead of 4. You can control steppers much more easily with only two outputs with a stepper driver like the DRV8825.
Taking a very basic approach and just using the Python library you could use `difflib.SequenceMatcher` between the files. There's a simple code example here: https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-develop-a-plagiarism-detector-in-the-Python-platform

That defeats the purpose of an infix operator - `a + b / c` vs `(a + (b / c)(ctx))(ctx)`, that's far too convoluted. You might as well do `b.div(ctx, c).add(ctx, a)` - except now it's in the wrong order.

If you're at (1, 1, 0, 0) and then go to (0, 1, 1, 0), you're doing a full step that jumps over (0, 1, 0, 0). Anyways, this is not a Python problem. You should also note that stepper motors lose most of their torque when doing half steps. Like 80%+ if I remember correctly. Connecting an actual load to the stepper might cause problems.
small projects, maybe a text adventure it a basic web page
Find a problem/something to improve, solve it with python. Easiest way to learn something is working out solutions yourself, that way YOU understand how to use python to solve a given problem. Try and solve some problems at https://projecteuler.net/ with python. If you get stuck you can look at how other people have solved the problems.
Sometimes you want your program to run quicker. You could buy a faster computer to do it, but that's expensive, and it might not make much difference. Maybe we can change the code instead so that it goes faster! How will we do that? First, we need to work out which bits of the code are slow. We call this 'profiling'. We run the code in another program which measures how long each part takes. The bits that take longest are the bits we should try to change.
Try python challenges like making a small game with pygame and work your way up to harder stuff 
I often write these kind of scripts. I would like to help you. But I need to see your code to tell you exactly where to fix it. Basically you need to use something like this inside a loop: my_csv_writer.writerow([value1, value2, valueN]) 
A beginner what? Are you able to program in another language and just want to learn this one? Or are you also leaning to program?
great minds think alike :) yep! will replace it with a merkle tree implementation so root hash can be calculated with N transactions. 
Find an itch to scratch and then tackle it in pieces. I like prime numbers and that was the initial motivation. Then I learned how to apply it to GIS at work. Not sure what I will do next. 
Also as a tip, get a good text editor/IDE. I used to use Sublime Text, switched over to Atom, and now use Spyder. (I still use Atom for other things, though. It's really nice) Spyder is an IDE, meaning you can easily test/run your code and whatever little snippets you want. It comes in Anaconda, which is also really nice to have/use. Sorry, no links, on mobile. Google should give you everything. 
I love Spyder. Though I wonder if one is not working on scientific stuff perhaps something simpler as the ones you mentioned before, would make more sense. Personally I switch between spyder, brackets and gedit depending on what I am doing.
Work on something related to why you want to learn python in the first place. If your only reason is something vague and empty like learning python just for the sake of learning python, you're going to really struggle to get beyond doing some basic tutorials. Python (and any programming language) is just a tool, no one learns how to use a screwdriver just to randomly put screws into random pieces of wood. Figure out what you want to build and go from there.
Feels bad man guess you can still check stuff with him or maybe in the future work on a project together.
git rekt /u/tsorn 
think of a fun personal project and work towards that drudging through tutorials will prepare you for an interview, but will kill your motivation
Very nice. But for the record, people should know that [line_profiler](https://github.com/rkern/line_profiler) is a much more in-depth solution and works from the terminal for people who don't use any IDE's. That's what most everyone uses to profile and optimize their code. I really like how the colors give an immediate at-a-glance idea of things, though. Great work!
You are absolutely right. This is not advertised as a replacement to any profiler. Profilers are quintessential tools which help us dig deep with respect to performance of the code. But not everyone knows how to use a profiler and make the best use out of it. Even people who do know how to use them sometime wish there was a way with quicker turn around time. This tool makes it simple for people to get a good idea of areas of contention in their code without the need of digging through profiler output. One can and should always use profilers like the one you pointed out to dig deep when in need but for most cases this tool helps in giving a good idea of code performance without much fuss.
I don't think they got it
I'd be interested in seeing what Numba's performance were.
or MItx at edx, free and very good
I'm missing many details here, but I will try to guess. 1. if your file name is `my_car` you must wirte `from my_car import car` or `import my_car`, since the file name is the module name. 2. you may called the class in the module `Car` (with capital "c"). what must be reflected in the import statement `from my_car import Car`. python is case sensitive language. 3. python will add current working directory to your `sys.path` by default. changing it manually is a sign for doing things in non-pythonic way. Hopes that I helped.
I started with Spyder because I first started programming in MATLAB and Spyder is very similar to the MATLAB interface, which made the jump less painful. However, since I started using Linux more and working on projects involving multiple languages, I've actually switched to using Sublime most of the time (even for MATLAB in some cases). I think it's all a matter of preference. I've heard good things about Atom though, I've just never tried it. What do you/did you like about it?
Fails to mention that an excessively high recursion limit will result in segfaults instead of RuntimeErrors.
Unfortunately numba doesn't work with all parts of Scipy, and that appears to include this subset. Using this code: @numba.jit(nopython=True) def fn(): for i in range(N): a = beta.logpdf(i, 1, 2) @numba.jit(nopython=True) def fn_array(): a = beta.logpdf(list(range(N)), 1, 2) start = time.time() fn() end = time.time() print(end - start) start = time.time() fn_array() end = time.time() print(end - start) results in a range of compilation errors mostly centered around being unable to resolve the underlying types. This seems to be caused by the way in which scipy wraps a mix of fortran and c code in non-standard ways. edit: If you'd like to see all the code, check out the github repo here https://github.com/tmarkovich/cffi_examples/tree/master/beta_logpdf
I recently read through [Learn Python the Hard Way](learnpythonthehardway.com) and found it very helpful for learning Python. I do have some programming experience already (Java, PHP, JavaScript), but I think it’s a good resource even if you’re completely new to programming.
Grandfather lives on his own, building a simple device that counts down over an 18hour period, if it doesn't detect movement if sends the family an email. Using passive infrared to detect movement. Using raspberry pi as micro controller. Pi will also function as web server, will use php to update the page to give the time since last seen. He'd like the device in his hands in 12 hours...
You roll three dice six times and take what you get. 
1. Open text editor or IDE 2. Try to write some code in Python 3. Get confused or forget 4. Open web browser --&gt; Google --&gt; Look up syntax and use cases on Stack Overflow 5. Minimize browser 6. Attempt fixes and correct syntax 7. Go back to step 2
https://learnpythonthehardway.org/ I'm a Python beginner. I tried code academy and data camp...but didn't feel like either were doing the trick. So I sucked it up and started working through Zed Shaw's book. (Learn Python the Hard Way). I know people have some strong opinions about Zed being a jerk or whatever... but when you're starting from scratch I think he presents the best approach to learning a language. Once you start feeling comfortable with the basics try working on some Project Euler problems (https://projecteuler.net/). I found having projects to work on was the best way to sharpen my coding skills. 
Find a project around something you're passionate about. Home automation, cataloging games or tv shows, music, sports, social media, whatever will keep you interested. Then just dive in with the python documentation and tutorials as reference. Break stuff. Have fun. Don't be too hard on yourself when you can't get things to work. Programming can be really fun or it can be really stressful, try to turn your confusion into the former and you'll go far.

I like that screwdriver analogy, I'm gonna steal that.
Ehhh.... it's a scripting language we are talking about. Security in general is a pretty weak concept. You write a script, for me to be able to execute it I have to be able to read it, so I could just copy it and make my own f-string in that copy that does what I want it to. Now yes this also could be done with binaries (I just have to know how to read and write machine code/assembly), but for those files the OS does respect things like the setuid bit. It's really only web servers or other consumers of remote input that might benefit, but it's only covering one attack path. I would rather we had some way to actually tag data as trusted or untrusted, and then whitelist the operations we might apply to untrusted data than add a redundant string formatting method.
&gt; no one learns how to use a screwdriver just to randomly put screws into random pieces of wood [Relevant xkcd.](https://xkcd.com/905/)
Never heard of project Euler before. That's awesome. Totally signing up, thanks.
"Automate the Boring Stuff With Python" by Al Sweigart. Really helpful as a beginner. Also nice to have a physical "thing" instead of website is digital file. 
any folder with a module needs __init__.py
Pretty nice text... Already knew it actually haha Thing is, there's no sidebar haha, I am on mobile, I don't use a computer for like 6 months haha, and I had no idea of where to find them... Also, I don't know how reddit works, so many sub reddits, one for this, one for that... Things that belong to the same thing are separate (is it really necessary to create another subreddict for "learning python"? Reddit just seems a bloated website, seems like if someone says " we have freaking 1 million needles, but you gotta find them buried on the sand. Happy 1 million hole digging!"... Maybe that's why I don't use reddit that much...

I really enjoy PyCharm.
I am very open to programming languages... What I mean is I learn them quick with little effort, actually I learn everything that has to do with computers effortless... Actually the teacher that gave me the course of Microsoft access he said I could go straight to web developing (java, JavaScript and CSS) without going through easier Langs, he said I have capabilities to do it, he just recommended learning at least python first (he is a 42year old Sargent from the army (I am at the army myself too). He is a webmaster, he makes and sells his projects online as a hobby. So I don't think I need both courses, actually, I think I only need like a list of the keys or strings and a description and I will be already ready to go create something... That's what I did with HTML... I forgot it already though, HTML sucks on the modern day honestly...
I actually took the other one, seems to have more content. Thanks for your reply!
What's this cache.set function?
Pycharm pro version has a duplciate code detector that can work across all files in a project
Fyi it's not actually removed.

Wow, something weird is going on with my mod toolbox... Thanks for the heads up!
Start coding. Ask when you have problems. Maybe in /r/learnpython
The author is just using it as an example, and says "Let cache be something like Django cache". Django's cache framework exposes `get()` and `set()` functions to, well, get and set things in the cache.

I have.. I'm just wondering what track to go towards, if I use the YouTube API, or some other type of web scrapping library.
Thanks! Really great ELI5
Does pycharm do anything similar to this??
Not sure. But udemy is only like 10-15 dollars a course anyway. You could try haggling down for your group if it's like at least 10 people or so.
Thank you, great stuff.
And I guess it's worth noting that the Professional Edition for Individual Customers is currently -30% (which happens very rarily, to be honest). And it's got a 30-day trial, if you just wish to check it out.
Sadly I have always remained in the realm of IPython, BPython and Python interactive shell. So, I am not much help in answering this question.

The fact that the HMAC example doesn't use `compare_digest()` makes me wary of all the other examples. There are many, many hidden dangers in this stuff, and a basic thing like that indicates the rest of them probably have issues too.
Can you provide a link here? Suggestions and ideas are always welcome. In the end, the community as a whole should benefit that's the goal.
Cool definition!
lprun is part of the [line_profiler](https://github.com/rkern/line_profiler) package.
Using any form of hash for cache keys is a bad idea in the first place. Most cacheable data has some unique identifier. Use that as a key. Problem solved.
Use the YouTube api. See for example this topic on stackoverflow get the videos. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15512239/python-get-all-youtube-video-urls-of-a-channel/44871104#44871104
This stuff like this once again makes the fatal flaw of reasoning by Legos in Cryptography. People will just copy these code blocks into their codebase and then make dangerously broken crypto. &gt; Reasoning by Lego happens when a designer or developer understands cryptography as Lego blocks stacked together. The blue block (the MAC) is sitting on top of the red block (the encryption), therefore the blue block won’t fall down. Textbooks put cryptography algorithms on display as circuit diagrams with primitives like ciphers and hashes wired up to data like keys and plaintexts. This leads to the view that crypto algorithms should be thought of as simple components wired together. [source article](http://www.cryptofails.com/post/121201011592/reasoning-by-lego-the-wrong-way-to-think-about) Mere mortals simply should not be messing around with cryptographic primitives like RSA or AES, but use established systems designed and implemented by experts — for example, PyNaCl. If you don't, you are bound to make some tiny mistake (like the author of this repo likely has) somewhere along the lines and compromise the security of your whole system.
But isn't that what's fun about security? Fucking it up?
1) Why so much whitespace? 2) Look at datetime.strftime 
Which is exactly why the cryptography package's documentation advocates to use the high level APIs and not the low level stuff in the `cryptography.hazmat` package.
Unless "perfonal" is a word I spotted at least 1 typo in there. Just a mere mortal here though. 
looks good!
Welcome to r/iamverysmart 
I finished writing Password Generator code. Now I need a GUI to create a full app with this. EDIT: I used pygames to develop my Password Generator app. So far, it's 99.99% finished!
Until you have to tell a few hundreds of thousands of people that their social security numbers have been looted from your servers.
Oh yes, they do. The AES examples use CBC with PKCS7 and no MAC, which is the classic example of a scheme open to padding oracle attacks. Nowadays I’d recommend GCM (or EAX) as your block mode if it’s available, and otherwise CTR or CBC with a MAC on the IV &amp; ciphertext using a separate key. And I wouldn’t consider myself within even spitting distance of a crypto expert. What’s weird is that `cryptography` has _all_ of those primitives, so it’s concerning that the author didn’t use them. The key stretching is also using a custom function as opposed to one of the KDFs in `cryptography` as well (it looks like the function is basically HKDF, but the first rule of crypto is “don’t roll your own crypto,” so at the very least we could use the _primitives_). There’s also no guarding against nonce/IV reuse (which is a bad idea in general, but thankfully not catastrophic for CBC) in the symmetric crypto. Worse, the key &amp; IV are derived _from the initial key_, guaranteeing that any given key will always have the same IV, which opens you up to all sorts of attacks based around inference of plaintexts from a corpus of ciphertexts (With CBC if (Key₁, IV₁) == (Key₂, IV₂) then if C₁ == C₂, P₁ == P₂. Additionally the first block is now effectively in ECB mode. With CTR/GCM/EAX/etc. the results are [way worse](https://twitter.com/angealbertini/status/425561082841690112/photo/1)). There’s probably more stuff wrong, too (like the stuff around certificates seemingly ignoring any trust model, and the implication of a lack of understanding as to the maximum message length given a key size), but that’s what I found from a quick glance. The one bit of good news is that if you just use TLS with strong cipher suites (and a trusted cert with pinning) almost all of this will be done properly for you. I get the intent behind this, and I think that intent is genuinely good, but crypto is really not a place where you want to be giving any advice unless you’re either an expert or willing to couch your advice in a _bunch_ of caveats. (Also, and somewhat tangential: if we’re going to put together a “this is how you do things” cheatsheet, it wouldn’t hurt to espouse the most modern stuff we’ve got: ECDSA, AES-GCM, ECDHE, ECC and AEAD in general, scrypt, etc.)
Maybe you could set up an authenticated API endpoint in your web layer to write the data. Generally you don't want your raw database exposed to the internet, it's very unsafe.
If you are using cPanel, you want to go to Remote MySQL. I think that's the icon name. There you can whitelist a remote ip. You can also whitelist all ips, or blocks of ips. The only annoying thing is you have to update it of your ip changes or you work from somewhere else. 
Yeah, i read the same advice on another forum I posted this question. They recommended me to use AWS but not sure how to proceed from that
Are there any risks involved to whitelist 1 ip?
Started learning python a week ago. I am going to try and take a look at matplotlib!
I didn't even look at the rest of the stuff; I just skimmed headings for something that would be easy to check at a glance, saw the HMAC example and noped right back out of there.
Only if a hacker shares your ip.
I love the `cryptography` package, but when their only two recipes are Fernet and x509 they’re kinda asking for people to drop down into `hazmat`.
If you’re lucky enough to even realize it.
Maybe if you created a pull request with improvements he'd merge them.
I agree with you that HMAC is a bad example. :( I just want to give a simple glance about HMAC, but it seems a bad idea. I remove it and I will survey another better solution. Thanks!
Consider django-hotsauce tutorial and let me know if you have any troubles: http://www.isotopesoftware.ca/documentation/django-hotsauce/handbook/getting-started.html
I’m not totally comfortable with doing that as it’d be from a position of authority that I don’t feel I can lay claim to. Of course the alternative is to open some issue saying “you really shouldn’t have this crypto stuff here at all unless you can get an expert,” which feels pretty douchey. I _have_ been considering putting together a “this is how TLS works” type thing on GitHub (starting from a raw socket and finally ending up with something that almost mirrors the TLS handshake and data format) that’d go through a lot of this stuff alongside _why_ you do these things, which if I can ever sum up the courage to make public (with a host of caveats as to my expertise) would maybe be a better resource. It at least attempts to teach the _why_ over the _how_ so that people can get a better understanding of how hard security is and how paranoid you need to be when working on it, as opposed to saying “this is how you do this” which lacks nuance.
Lots of projects can get by with publishing a rough first draft and then gradually improving. A project designed to give advice on cryptography and general security... cannot afford to do that. People will get breached if they rely on the advice in this document, which is why this kind of thing needs to be carefully reviewed by qualified people *before it gets published*.
Yeah, I can definitely understand the hesitation to contribute to this. But, if it's going to be out there and available, if you know that you can improve it in any way then you probably should.
I admire that Quixotic spirit (and I mean that non-pejoratively), but then my name is getting attached to this work, and that’s taking on a lot of responsibility for something I wouldn’t have enough control over.
Well, yeah, no shit. Ideally, the project wouldn't be out there at all. But, the fact of the matter is that it is. So, improving it is better than simply leaving it as is. 
Yeah, I can appreciate that.
sounds like paranoia to me.
I have the same question that why ``cryptography`` just gives some simple examples and those examples seems not practical in the real world. For example, some key files already exist in our system, but the example only gives ``generate_key `` without other recommendations. In this case, I just want to give a glance how to use it. However, it made some security mistake. Hope all guys can give suggestions. Thanks
The main argument I give to people when they are deciding R vs Python is that, regardless of which you think is better for data analysis, Python is better/capable everywhere else. ... so the answer of what you could learn is... everything else. As you already acknowledged, Python's main weakness is in gaming and mobile. I do not think we'll see any AAA titles in Python any time soon :P While you can dev for mobile in Python, what you're really doing at the end is converting it Right now, Python's fastest growing field (totally based anecdotally on what I've personally been seeing both in what other people are doing and where my tutorials traffic is) is [deep learning](https://pythonprogramming.net/neural-networks-machine-learning-tutorial/). I think you can do deep learning basics in R, but the cutting edge is possible and happening in Python (of course thanks to wrappers around C). Deep learning might still be too close to what you want, so then probably the next largest field that you haven't mentioned would be [web development](https://pythonprogramming.net/web-development-tutorials/) in either Django or Flask... or any of the many other web dev frameworks for Python. Beyond that, you can do things like [robotics and IoT](https://pythonprogramming.net/robotics-tutorials/) with Python, GUIs as you already mentioned...and a bunch more. Basically anything is possible with Python, but it's really good at data analysis, machine learning, and web development. 
Thank for your recommendations. :) 
There's also the author's `EVP_ByteToKey` KDF which I assume is based on OpenSSL's `EVP_BytesToKey`, a very old KDF which the author made *less* secure by removing the `count` parameter leaving a KDF with zero key-stretching. Also, there was no attempt at Unicode-normalizing the password. Another one: in some versions of Python, using `ssl.wrap_socket` without `create_default_context` first can end in an SSL socket which permits SSLv2 (and other version default with SSLv3, broken cipher suites, compression permitted, etc.). 
Here's a step by step video and text tutorial for Django web dev, specifically linking to the step-by-step part where we deploy our **[Django App to a Digital Ocean VPS](https://pythonprogramming.net/django-web-server-publish-tutorial/)**. While it is on a full VPS, part of the work was done for us with an image that DO offers. Still might be enough for you if your goal is VPS, but maybe you don't want Digital Ocean.
ha!! thanks. I will fix it
... are you sure the provider is blocking it? By default, remote access to MySQL is disabled for security reasons. You need to enable it in mysql console by adding the allowance for a username on a specific IP address AAAAAAAAAAND you need to edit my.cnf to accept outside connections too. If you google for "remote access mysql," you will find your answer. Someone else's cPanel suggestion could work too, might be easier to try that first if you're not as comfortable with the console.
Hi, I’m trying to do something similar (I started learning Python today...) as I’ve done it currently in an Excel spreadsheet using macros. I download a table from a website, then scan that data for a certain phrase, then email recipients if that phrase is found. Any pointers you could give would be hugely appreciated, I’ve got a Raspberry Pi 3 which is what I’m hoping to do this on by running the check script every minute. If you have any spare time to give pointers that would be amazing as my experience is in VBA and SQL only
Ty, I searched around all night and couldn't find this lol although, would it be possible to just get the first element of the list, instead of the whole list? (the latest video) 
The KDF is really weird because it seems a mix of OpenSSL’s KDF _and_ HKDF, but the latter is explicitly not for key stretching non-random inputs. So while having no iteration count is not a problem per se in HKDF (since your possible inputs should cover the entire key space), it _is_ a problem in this KDF, which is taking in a user supplied password. PBKDF2 would be my choice here (it’s even got password in the name!), which is also a primitive exposed by `cryptography`. The unicode normalizing bit is not necessarily bad: normalizing your input reduces the key space, so you’re trading better UX for “worse” security. That trade shouldn’t _really_ be a problem, though, if you’re doing everything else correctly. If my git log is correct, `wrap_socket` passed `PROTOCOL_SSLv23` as the default `ssl_version` up until around a year ago when it was changed to `PROTOCOL_TLS`. Using `create_default_context` should be enough to get a context with the best practices _known at the time of your Python release_, and I’m not sure if that’s better or worse than having developers hardcode a context.
If i remember correctly that's the first element. Just modify the code to your need.
Quick question about creating a server in python, in the example code they created an http server but how would you create an https server?
You can take a look at my code to download the table. Then you use something like if 'blabla' in open('example.txt').read(): # email the file to some people Python is really simple, but if you only started learning it today you should read through the book Dive into Python, it’s really well written 
Awesome, thanks for the help
What goes into this and what helped you create bots? This is super interesting. I am just starting on learning about python and coding in general and what you can do with it continues to amaze me every day. Did you just think all of this through your head on how to create a bot, or did you read things that gave you guidelines or helped in making this?
I _still_ have no clue why I would use this library. What does it offer over standard Django?
The “S” in “HTTPS” is really a wrapper _around_ HTTP. In Python you’d handle TLS/SSL at the socket level (since TLS/SSL is agnostic as to what data it’s transporting), which is what is being done with `ssl.wrap_socket`.
&gt; In my example I define the class inside of a function Why? &gt; Is this the proper way to use such a visitor class if I want to return some data (i.e. class nested in function)? Well technically `visit` will return the value of the visitor method it invokes, however `visit_generic` will not (since it may be getting an unbounded number of return values from sub-visits and has no way to collect, filter and fold, you could define your own `visit_generic` which does so though), so depending on your needs you'd either set an attribute on your visitor which it'd ultimately return, or pass in a mutable object which the visitor can fill somehow. &gt; I am aware the two use a different tree traversal (depth vs breadth first). Walk's traversal order is actually *undefined*, hence the note about using it when you don't need *context*, basically with "walk" you can only assume what you get directly from an AST node. Furthermore `ast.walk` does not allow "skipping" subtrees, it just walks the entire tree period. &gt; I get the sensation though that the visitor pattern is overkill here Well you say absolutely nothing of your use case so it's impossible to know whether it's overkill. But if ast.walk is not constraining to you then it's just fine, ast.walk has much lower semantic overhead than a full-blown visitor. &gt; What is the benefit of the visitor() method over the walk() method? First, as noted above `ast.Visitor` does depth-first traversal, whereas `ast.walk` does undefined-order traversal. Second `ast.Visitor` lets you "skip" subtrees (if you define a custom visit method and don't call `generic_visit`, the visitor will not recurse into the current node) which is often convenient when visiting a tree: you look for a "base" node then you "fork off" a new visitor to process the subtree rather than do so from the main visitor and thus end up with a "tree" of visitors calling one another rather than just a big visitor, this provides better separation of concerns and makes state easier to track, especially when it's transient and only valid for some subtrees.
"cryptography" and "security" are quite different things. Title is quite misleading.

Try YouTube-dl as a module
Eh, I kinda dispute that. Don't get me wrong, I love Jupyter and its notebooks, and I wrote all the Python code during my undergraduate dissertation using them. But once you start creating multi-module projects and start importing functions and classes from one module into another, Jupyter notebooks start to get in the way and you will want to code using .py text files instead.
The paid version has a profiler.
Python has "arbitrary precision" so it won't overflow. It will just allocate more memory for the integer.
Check out this guide for deploying Django to Digital Ocean. It's from December 2016, so it's relatively up-to-date. https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-django-with-postgres-nginx-and-gunicorn-on-debian-8
I guess you forgot to point to a specific line?
It was pretty easy! There was a bot tutorial with a lot of upvotes in /r/learnpython Im on mobile so I cant link it
Thanks for your reply. &gt; Why? I put the class in the function because it is the only way I found to return data from the visitor class. I noticed in the examples I could find that some global variable was being mutated and I would like to encapsulate that. Just for a lack of knowing a better way. &gt; Walk's traversal order is actually undefined, hence the note about using it when you don't need context, basically with "walk" you can only assume what you get directly from an AST node. Furthermore ast.walk does not allow "skipping" subtrees, it just walks the entire tree period. All clear on the traversal being undefined rather than breadth first. Also, I figured having the context could be of good use. Just couldn't make it work for my case. &gt; if ast.walk is not constraining to you then it's just fine, ast.walk has much lower semantic overhead than a full-blown visitor This is good to know but of course I am too curious, and as I am beginning to see that the `visit` method can be beneficial in slightly more complex tasks, or much bigger trees. &gt; technically visit will return the value of the visitor method it invokes, however visit_generic will not (since it may be getting an unbounded number of return values from sub-visits and has no way to collect, filter and fold, you could define your own visit_generic which does so though), so depending on your needs you'd either set an attribute on your visitor which it'd ultimately return, or pass in a mutable object which the visitor can fill somehow. This I still can't figure that out, so please bear with me.. The visitor method (in this case `visit_FunctionDef`) is also called an arbitrary number of times right? Whatever I try to get a return value directly from the `visit(tree)` method, I end up with `None`. I am failing to see how "`visit` will return the value of the visitor method it invokes" because the underlying method can be called an arbitrary amount of times. Since I don't like the idea of passing in a mutable object I am interested in setting an attribute and return that at the end. After some fidgeting I found this works.. class MyVisitor(ast.NodeVisitor): functions = [] def visit_FunctionDef(self, node): MyVisitor.functions.append(node.name) self.generic_visit(node) MyVisitor().visit(tree) print(len(MyVisitor.functions)) And now it suddenly seems to click! Thanks!! Looks better to me.. am I doing this right? (still curious return value from the `visit_FunctionDef` method, and how to gather / fold) 
Thanks
Perhaps better with an instance attribute.. like so: class MyVisitor(ast.NodeVisitor): def __init__(self): self.functions = [] def visit_FunctionDef(self, node): self.functions.append(node.name) self.generic_visit(node) v = MyVisitor() v.visit(tree) print(len(v.functions)) Another point of confusion is the part about the context. I think I understand quite well the benefits of passing of arbitrary sub-trees, and using `iter_children()` you could traverse the tree at certain levels quite efficiently in stead of running through the entire thing like `walk()` does. I don't see an easy way to reference parent elements though. Is this something I am overlooking? Should this be done with some nested visitor-classes?
&gt; I still have no clue why I would use this library. What does it offer over standard Django? One of the objective of django-hotsauce is to provide a scalable framework for accessing Django using Cython. 
&gt; Learning another language is a waste of time since every language basically has the same things in different shells and after a while those slide down really easy. If you only have written python and nothing else there's some things you haven't been exposed to. You could spend some time and learn c and get exposed to memory management, pointers and remove a layer of abstraction. It's also not a oo language. You can also learn a functional language like haskell or one that lets you do it like scala. There's a lot of features those languages have like pattern matching that python doesn't have. I think learning a functional language will make you a better programmer in general. It forces you to write in a way that I think is more manageable and maintainable.

What advantages does that have over Django? Better question: what problem does this library solve for you that Django and other libraries don't solve?
Side note: I personally find the Python AST lib not very good. It can't roundtrip because it throws away formatting and the API is rather wonky (as you've discovered). I use baron to implement my mutation testing system but that has incomplete Python 3 support :( Otherwise much nicer to work with imo. And it roundtrips!
You can learn a lot from other languages! Just not from a c-like language such as Python. It seems like you know what to do, but are just being lazy. Can I ask where you're from, since you can't legally work?
If you do not want to start a project yet, but you still want to learn I would invest some time in learning C. In addition to what tayo42 said, it can extend your knowledge of Python, since the Python interpreter is written in C (CPython). Otherwise, you could try learning core topics in CS, such as Algorithms and Data Structure or Operating Systems 
Your first statement is a clear indicator that learning another language is exactly what you should do to become a better programmer. Programming in a statically typed or functional language is a big difference compared to python and is far from just the same thing in another shell. Especially since compiled languages such as C arent executed in a shell at all. Learning another language will help you improve both your understanding of programming in general and add another tool to your toolbox and would probably be a very good way to spend your time. 
Erlang. It has a wonderful tendency to wrap itself around your head and when you finally think you've come to terms with it, you realize that it's your brain that's wrapped around... something.
I used the [astunparse](https://github.com/simonpercivall/astunparse) package with its `unparse()` method for transforming a tree back into code. Haven't tested extensively, only use it to extract a `dict` from the AST and hand it back to my running code as a value. I know there are some other libraries out there, I will look at them if necessary. Thanks! -edit- baron seems to do quite a bit more, and aimed at full syntax rather than just abstract. Nice!
Yea, astunparse won't give you comments back for example. Which can be a deal breaker for some situations. 
&gt; what problem does this library solve for you that Django and other libraries don't solve? Django-hotsauce plays very nicely with Non-SQL databases, including Durus and ZODB. :) 
There are other libraries that solve that problem. Regardless, your selling points all seem to involve microframework, Cython, and various buzzwords. I legitimately want to know why anyone should use he library. You seem quite passionate about the project. I see your various posts about new versions. I ignore them because you have yet to offer a good use case for the project.

I guess you forgot this was a free service? 😁 But "cmd+f right shift" is a thing. I am sure someone of your ability can sort it out.
Isn't security all about compromises as perfect security is impossible? Without looking at the the total system, it's hard to say anything beyond---okay you're using cryptography. What's bad though is making undocumented compromises, or worse flawed systems that don't do what you think they're doing. But not using `compare_digest`? Well that leaves your system more open to timing attacks than if you were not---granted lossy networks, cache jitters, and retry limits may make this a moot point---but it's a *known* and [documented issue](https://docs.python.org/2/library/hmac.html), not an example of black magic.

I will learn C then, I've heard C and python go together like jelly and butter so why not
1. I was told in school (programming high school) all high-level languages are c-like languages. Now you're telling me there are other ones? 2. Bulgaria. Afaik I can't work while I'm 15 (at least not for any money - I am allowed to do job shadowing though)
