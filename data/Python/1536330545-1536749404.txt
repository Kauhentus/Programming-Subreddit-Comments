Fair enough - I'll accept that.
You can gladly follow. I'm a bit if a beginner though. I don't have a github yet because I wasn't sure it'd be a good idea to share my scraping technique and the site I'm scraping public. I don't believe it'll be massively popular though, so I'll set one up tonight or tomorrow night and let you know. I've never used Discord so I'll check that out. The project started a couple of years ago as a simple spreadsheet. That grew to it pulling data from websites (slowly) and then to some very complicated formulas and vba (which I learned especially for the project). It was pretty powerful, but I think it outgrew what excel was designed for. It's really fascinating if that's what you're into (I love it). There are some books you might be able to pick up from your local library, a local charity shop or ebay. Soccernomics is one, I'll check the others later. I'd better start commenting my code... 😂 
That was the problem that motivated my first TI Basic program, too, I think. Good old quadratic equation. I also am now a software developer. That experience is one of two that I credit with having put me on that path. The other was having to configure startup.bat to put the RAM in EMS vs. XMS depending on which game I was playing on my 486. 
I solved it by installing 3.6. Pretty strange, I think something is wrong with my python 3.7 install or the installer is busted.
Turn on the -v flag for verbose so it prints out everything. pip install -v -r requirements.txt Then read all the words. You will see a message about your library not being installed and the reason for it.

Also, once I managed to scrape the prem, it's been fairly easy to create a menu so that any league can be scraped. It scrapes 19 leagues at the moment, but easy to add more 😉
why are you on 2.7
Codecademy needs to get their shit together 
Get it all together and put it in a backpack, all your shit, so it’s together. And if you gotta take it somewhere, take it somewhere, you know. Take it to the shit store and sell it, or put it in the shit museum. I don’t care what you do, you just gotta get it together. Get your shit together.
Famous mit professor Gerald Jay sussman agrees with you strongly. If you can write a computer program to do it for to you, you probably understand it well enough. He also said you're wasting time doing it manually if you're not doing it for the sake of learning.
Also its input() instead of raw_input in python3
I've started working on some kind of an extension for the Python worker pool. My idea is to create a worker pool, where master process can easily communicate with slaves via pipes, get execution time of currently processing tasks, stop slaves from getting new tasks from the queue. Next step after finishing this pool would be implementing progress bar, where every slave's state is showing separately. I think using this pool, running unittest in parallel may be easier than ever before, as it would all be about inserting testcases into task queue and bam! your tests are running in parallel.
Someone actually made a quaternion dtype for numpy, but I'm not sure it still works. I just write my own functions to operate on 4xN arrays.
3.4 isn't well supported, you want to be on at least 3.5. Use pipenv to set up a 3.6 interpreter. Of you have enough access to install pip packages on deployment then you can do this
You aren’t specifying the two files for the conversion, only the folder which contains them. The first line of the doc says specify the file or a folder which contains a batch of the files. Your directory contains one of each...
What is Git and why it is important? 
Google the ultimate flask tutorial, there is a 20 something part written tutorial covering a lot of stuff you need to do.
Why not just provide your own separate Python environment then? You don't need `sudo`, you just need `source`.
His teacher was probably jealous because he didn't know how to make the program!
Yup. That was me as a middle-schooler with an old RadioShack book my uncle gave me and a copy of qbasic. My math teacher actually had me just print him the very short source code for my homework sets.
In a nutshell, Git is version control software. It lets you create 'snapshots' of your project directory (aka working directory) and have complete history of changes. Git also has very strong and fast branching system. Now, what are branches you ask? It is an independed copy of the working directory. Usualy you have one branch for the currently stable version of the software. Then you have a feature branch where you develop new features and later 'merge' (join) them into the main branch. That way you always have a stable version somewhere. And if, for example, you recieve a report of a critical bug in your software, you can 'commit' (store) your work on the feature branch and create a new branch from 'main', which has no extra work done. There you can fix the bug and merge it back into 'main', and then continue your work on 'feature' exactly where you left off. I can imagine that this is kind of a mess, so if you didn't understand anything, let me know, I'll try to explain it better. Also, if you want to get some resources (especially books), hit me up.
A statement. Like return.
`pip install -r requirements.txt` generally installs the *requirements* for the package, not the package itself. You'd normally run it when you're working on the package itself, not incorporating it into your project. `zenpy` is [on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/zenpy/), so the typical way to install it would be to run: pip install zenpy If you're interested, what happens behind the scenes is `pip` downloads the tarball from PyPI, extracts it, then runs `python setup.py install` on it. `setup.py` specifies the packages that are required to install this one, which may be different from the packages in `requirements.txt`. Here's [`zenpy`'s `setup.py`](https://github.com/facetoe/zenpy/blob/master/setup.py).

In the long term though, you'll forget the algorithm unless you mentally recalling it with enough frequency. If you just code it from the book and forget it, then you have not learned.
That's fair. I realize in the long run that would most likely be easier, but this is still a very early version of my project, so I was mostly concerned with getting it running properly. Thanks for your advice!
Hey, this seems really cool and want to check it out but I’m getting a 404.
If you look at pysqlite or the sqlite support in the standard library, you'll probably find that it's not as bad as you think. Learning a bit of sql will push you out of your comfort zone, but if you can do this type of chemistry you're plenty smart enough. The big advantage to sql is that with a few words in the query you can get the data out any way you want it, which simplifies the rest of your code. You probably want to minimize whole system complexity so you can get back to the interesting bits. Sql helps that and a few hours invested there will really help later. 
misspell* :) Funnily it's one of the most commonly misspelled words.
I'd like to thank 640k of memory, without which none of my life would be possible. 
I smell pycharm! i love jetbrains!
That's a good way to learn.
Well easily hackable by attacking the stream but besides a nice idea💡. Keep on coding 
Also a bit picky but spaces in file names aren't a great practice :)
Python 2 reeeeeeee. &amp;#x200B; You won't have too hard of a time learning Python 3, don't worry!
Are you using python 2.7 If yes, then why? You could have made it without using strings
I think the python devs did a blog post about how they wouldn't make the same mistakes on 3 to 4 that they did with 2 to 3
One year Grandma bought us Marble Madness for Christmas. We had to upgrade the RAM to play it. Bought a 128k stick. Probably cost Dad a couple hundred bucks. 
If it's used less and less every year then it increases the coders worth to know about it, as they can work with legacy code. Same thing as the current landscape if you know even an ounce of FORTRAN. 
Hm... https://github.com/StabiloSGU/Excel-sheet-list-splitter/blob/master/splitter%201.1.py 
Thanks!!! 
I had a class that taught python to engineering students last year and we used python 2.7. 
IIRC it decays too.
Yep, Looking at it now!
And in 30 years, those engineers will still be using python 2.7. It is going to be like Fortran 77 all over again.
I started programming with a TI82 in 2011 and now pursuing my dreams to become a full time programer, so I can relate definitely!
TBH I think most already forgot most of it.
Program firsts asks you which xlsx file you want to split, then asks the column its going to split the file and then asks if you want to split it by sheet (0) or create new file for each set (1), if everything goes ok it will as you if you wish to split another file (1 or 0)
I have that last part done if you want it lol
Damn, I just cheated by writing the programs and using them on my exams. My trusty TI 84.
Depends where you are working, my company would not find any of those skills desirable...
Awesome, dude! Implementing something like this and having it match the API of a built-in type is really good practice.
Because some libraries I'm trying to work with aren't yet compatible with 3.7.
check out sentdex on youtube and https://pythonprogramming.net/
I agree with what u/apreche said. It really depends on how much searching your doing. For future reference, this kind of question is generally better suited for subs like r/learnprogramming or r/learnpython
Along this line, if you’re going to search multiple times consider loading the data into a set. 
Good thing there's a few more than one company.
Tip: Have your midpoint function take the points as parameters. That was it's *actually* a function in the mathematical sense. def midpoint(x1, y1, x2, y2): return (x1 + x2) / 2, (y1 + y2) / 2 xmid, ymid = midpoint(0, 0, 2, 2) assert xmid == 1 &amp;&amp; ymid == 1
Complexity of linear search is O(n). That means in the worst case it takes one iteration over all items to say sth is not present. Complexity for sorting is roughly (depending on the implementation) O(n*logn) and binary search is O(logn). Meaning worst case you will need (n+1)*logn operations. Second is certainly more expensive than the first one, if you are about to apply the logic once. The more often you do it though, the smaller the gap. Because in the later case the sorting cost is only paid once. And for k number of searches k*logn is much smaller than k*n, that means that if you want to make the operations many times, then sorting and using binary search is going to be much faster in the long run. Example with numbers. Having a list with 128 items will cost 128*7=896 operations to sort. Searching 1 item will cost 128 operations for linear and 896+7=903 operations. If you search 16 items, linear has a total cost of 16*128=2048 operations while the sorting +binary will have a total cost of 896+4*7=924 operations. 
Thanks! I will definitely go over the refactored version.
Yes but most companies unless ancient monoliths share similar views, only people with the views you have I encounter are those old software devs who are also salty about the youths quickly surpassing them in the field. Embrace the future, you can always pick up skills needed for legacy code as needed, that’s part of being a engineer....
Python follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) (at least as far as I can tell) Basically an upgrade from 2.x.x-&gt;3.x.x will break code, but a jump from 3.x.x -&gt; 3.7.x wouldn't because it doesn't change any core functionality, just adds features when the 2nd number increments
Thanks for the information. What exactly are globals and function arguements?
The pylons team didn't give up. They merged with the repoze.bfg project and turned into Pyramid: [https://web.archive.org/web/20101113024153/http://plope.com/bfg-becomes-pyramid](https://web.archive.org/web/20101113024153/http://plope.com/bfg-becomes-pyramid) There are a lot of good arguments on both sides, and if there's a reason to use 2.7 due to a needed library, prior code bases, or because it's an educational or work requirement, there is no harm in using it. Ultimately, Python 3 has a lot of breaking changes because it *is* a major change. Libraries/projects using a versioning like semantic versioning will indicate breaking changes on a major release. Like you have stated, the company can take the responsibility to patch the code. When Python 2.7 becomes deprecated[^(1)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/#id2), a company can manage it internally and patch it accordingly as they need. If they are running in a contained environment, they will be fine for however long they need their code to run.
Am I missing something? How does a web-camera have enough entropy to generate true random number? What if something's blocking my camera and it's all black?
What exactly is numpy and virtualnev? 
I don't understand this...
Because there is no linebreak and indentation after your frist print ?
Yup.
Thanks for taking the time to explain this.
Yup, I agree. We actually aren't allowed to use calc.s for tests. Just did this to check over after I had finished.
hentai.txt &amp;#x200B; oh no... 
PyCharm
I specifically took a picture of the screen so people wouldn't nitpick my code, but obviously that didn't work...
I agree for the most part but here is an example where I feel unit tests are next to useless: def save_model(foo): db.add(foo) db.commit() # foo now has an id set return foo If I was unit testing this I would have to mock out db but if I mocked out db I'm not really testing anything any more. These type of situations happen quite often and when developers go out of their way to write unit tests for every-single-function it ends up being a lot of code for very little value (or next to no value). In this situation I would hook a test db (usually via docker) and run it as an "integration" test. It touches the db, but I would still classify it as somewhat of a unit test. If the function has little or no dependencies, unit tests are perfect. But when functions talk to other dependencies and you mock out those dependencies, what you end up testing is very little. Especially if the contract to those dependencies change, your code will break but your tests will pass because it was mocked out. In that situation, you end up having to write an integration test anyway...
PyCharm
What did the error message say?
Invalid syntax
Yes, thanks, that makes sense. And I guess I did know what function arguements are.
Well, make sure to have a dynamic video input if you actually want to have random numbers :) I was testing it on a web camera pointing to a highway view from the window of my apartment and during 3.5 hours testing there were no duplicated numbers. However, I agree that in some cases (especially with a static video input) numbers might repeat.
It doesn’t want to be written this way
This is just cruel. There's actually a lot of merit in advocating use of classes to put in OOPs structuring to a program. If the kid wants to release it as a library, the classes will help a lot. Plus it helps better to have some grip on any form of design pattern rather than bashing out basic wild scripts. Because this is what I see even 4+ yr experienced programmers write in interviews when they already know a lot of design patterns and OOPs concepts and know the value of reusability. You guys are bashing me straight-up like as if I bullied the kid, which I didn't. It just shows how much butt hurt and fragile the members of this subreddit have become. Jesus. Can't even take criticism for someone else's code without having to bash the unpopular opinion guy's head in. Good luck with that attitude.
That's more of an "pull your code out of the notebook after EDA/testing/for your final program" argument than an argument for totally avoiding it. Although If you're not doing data stuff or testing a new library it might be a bit useless.
The best part was making a program to fake cleaning up your programs.
That's giving up. They completely altered the Pylons model and infrastructure in pyramid. Pylons 1.1 was supposed to come out with Py3 support but they gave up on that and decided to work on Pyramid instead. But other than that, yeah, I agree. But this subreddit just likes to shit on Py2 and anyone using it. They don't understand that there are valid reasons for not switching.
Take a look at [Pyrr](https://github.com/adamlwgriffiths/Pyrr).
Where u programming?(I mean program name) 
Hey kid, some random John "having your back" on the internet isn't going to make you a better programmer. Learn to ask others why they have the opinion they present, and try to reason out the logic behind it rather than ganging up on someone along with other two bit hacks. You can go a long way or stay as the fish jn the pond.
r/learnpython and read their sidebar before posting.
Virtualenv is an environment manager for python. Often in python, you install packages (modules) via pip (python's package manager). Some projects require different versions of packages. Trying to install packages without environment management can lead to bloat and dependency hell. Virtualenv makes a local copy of your "system" python and lets you install packages just to that copy. Every time you start working on a project, you can create an environment for just that project. Numpy is a package that makes working with arrays (numpy arrays) much more intuitive... and a lot more. Again, get familure with the core features, then start looking at these things as you feel more and more comfortable. https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/ https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/ http://www.numpy.org/

Just starting out in python, how can you tell he's using 2.x?
Pypperoni should work with all forms of Python 2.7 code, including lambdas. If you ever discover a bug running it, feel free to open an issue on GitHub! :)
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
\&gt; just started python \&gt; python2.7 This isn't just any line segment length calculator, its a enterprise-ready^tm line segment length calculator! /s Nice work!
I'm working on a tool that uses static analysis data to determine readiness of a code base for platform/language/cloud migration.
There are [Firmata compatible hats](https://github.com/firmata/arduino/wiki/WiFi-compatible-boards-and-shields) that use WiFi to "tether" the device, instead of the USB cable. But, this still requires a "master" PC up and running, sending commands to the Arduino. I also can't vouch for the latency of any of the products. 
I'm struggling with a good way to package my python package for red hat. I can install it with pip but not all of those packages carry over with system available rpms. I like being able to call the scripts directly without a virtalenv but seems impossible to get it right with reasonable tooling without pip by itself. Does anybody have suggestions?
A good practise for you could also be doing running time analysis on the procedures you wrote. Most will be blatantly obvious, but it gives you an easy overview on what can be improved further on.
There's a project called video_entropyd which pretty much does just that. As for ensuring the input really is random, two suggested ways are to point the camera at a lava lamp and to modify the camera to put a small radioactive element up to the sensor.
Isn't there some company that does something similar with lava lamps? 
Lenght
It was just that about 40 other people had already pointed out the same error, but had done it in a much nicer way and had explained how to resolve it. Also being reffered to as "kid" didn't really help. Gosh I sound entitled....
PyCharm
Exactly what happened to me! I wrote a simple program to solve the quadratic formula and my teacher let me use it. He then told the rest of the class if they could do it then they would be allowed too. 
No, services like Integral ad science and moat and others work hard to prevent this. Further, sites which have too much NHT (non human traffic) can be removed from as services.
So how would you suggest I work around this?
When you create a new project in pycharm it will create a new virtualenv for that project for you by default. Basically it allows you to isolate libraries between projects. 
Unfortunately not, that would be much prettier. __pragma__ is not a proper function, but a directive to the Transcrypt compiler, and so must be invoked directly.
I do this all the time for repetitive code. I write a script with the framework and let python fill in the blanks. Makes life so easy to build a database CRUD.
I really got into it while taking electronics in the early 2000s, I had prior experience as early as 1996, but I wrote a bunch of calculators for the the useful equations. My teacher thought it was awesome.
Haha, good stuff! I've also found that doing this ends up being a good way to gain a deep understanding of the work itself - since programming it requires you to know it inside out and back-to-front - AND you get experience programming! 
I had the same scenario. I learned to program my TI-83 while in Saturday school. My FST (Functions, Statistics, and Trigonometry) teacher made me erase the memory for the final just to teach the other kids that programs could be used, but not traded. Anything I wrote after that I could use. I was done with the final in time for more shenanigans. 😁
That's just bad teaching. 
It says so under "external libraries" in his IDE, up in the top left.
every ad blocker already has whitelist functionality for this exact reason
Just do it as you normally would and fix all the errors as they come. Very few, if any, of the porting issues are actually difficult. But many cover subtle bugs in the py2 version.
Is Docker an option? Just run in a container.
Don't forget that python 3.4 will reach its end-of-life in March 2019! The LTS OS you're using may provide longer support, but open source packages probably won't...

I am trying to write a program that when I type in the weight I want to load my barbell up to in the gym it'll spit out what plates to use. I'm completely new to this so if there is a dumb/newb questions thread it would be much appreciated if you could point me there
For beginners it good to not use scrapyard and stuff and do it on your own which is what you did so+1 for that . But since your code is on GitHub it should have a README.md file explaining what the project is, how to use it, how can someone setup on their environment also add requirements.txt or pipenv(which ever you like) files if you have external dependencies. Even if your project is big and just a small thing it's really nice to have all those things on GitHub. Optionally you can add gifs/screenshots to make it more attractive
Good work! Just one small thing, I find the divider comments #=========# unnecessary. The “structure” of your logic is already apparent in your code itself, so it’s safe to remove them
Python
(somebody correct me if I'm wrong, but) In helpers.py instead of: ``` requests.Session.__init__(self) ``` use ``` super().__init__() ```. Also, if you just add `self.headers = {urheaders}` in your `__ini__()` method, then all your requests will have those headers (there may be a similar prop you can set for timeout, you'll have to read the docs). Personally, I would have parsed the HTML with `lxml.html.fromstring()` method. You can feed the result of requests.get(whatever).content straight into that without any processing. (Not sure if you can use cssselect on etree but), the cssselect addon for lxml (pip install cssselect) is a life saver if you hate XML like me. Last but not least, I personally wouldn't inherit from `requests.Session`. But I'm not an expert by any stretch, and this is just a completely different way of approaching it that I never considered before.
The Node class looks like a perfect candidate for python's new dataclasses!
I don’t think it really matters, to be honest. I find the two languages to be similar in many respects and learning one once you know the other shouldn’t be too difficult.
Python is a better choice if you are learning the language to get a job. The experience of working with python will be a lot closer to the patterns you will see working with C# and Java which are the standard languages in most of the larger organizations where there are a lot of jobs. At the same time, if you want to do front-end web development work then JavaScript would be the better choice. Both can teach you object oriented concepts (as long as you're using Typescript or Babel with JavaScript) in addition to some light functional concepts. Another option might be to learn both by building a web application where you use Python for the server and JavaScript single page application.
120% Python. JavaScript has a lot of stupid quirks that are going to throw you for a loop as a beginner. That’s not to say that Python doesn’t have quirks, but it’s more manageable and it will do more for you as a language. It can do nearly everything JavaScript can and it can do about a billion and a half things that JavaScript can’t. 
I mean a function like that I wouldn't bother writing a unit test for, and wouldn't bother writing a function that simple in the first place, but if I did want to for some reason I'd just patch out add and commit. def test_save_model(): db = MagicMock() f = save_model('stuff') db.add.assert_called_once_with('stuff') db.commit.assert_called_once() assert f == 'stuff' Pretty useless since you're just duplicating the function inside the unit test line by line, but if it was a bit more complex and did something to foo and `db.add`ed something else based on foo, then you could assert it was called with what you expect and assert commit is called, if there was some condition where it might or might not be. But yeah, I don't write unit tests if it's just going to be a line by line test that I implemented it that exact way. Something a little more complex where you might want a good unit test of something that hits the db would be where it takes the params from an http request, converts it into a db query like a django `Foo.objects.filter(...)`, and then returns results. The bulk of your logic could be transforming the http params into the proper filter, and then you could test that it made the right query you expect. Like if an http request came in to `http://api.example.org/motorcycle?model=yamaha&amp;make=vstar|yzf` you could unit test like Motorcycle.objects.filter.assert_called_once_with( model__icontains='yamaha', make__in={'vstar', 'yzf'}, ) Your unit test could test a dict input of the params and make sure the kwargs of the filter match some expected output. I'm not saying it's the end of the world to use integration tests to test stuff that does DB work because I do myself. It's the standard thing with django tests. It creates a test db and all that each run. But, you really don't have to and you could pretty easily mock out the ORM calls and write unit tests that are still helpful.
Nice code. Ditch all the "==" dividers, they're unnecessary. Good job though with the ample comments. That is a good habit to get into early on.
Hah, same, started coding exactly around 1994 with a TI-89. I wrote functions that would show the work as well, super helpful. And I was able to use it on tests and just copy it down. But your teacher is completely right... by the time you finish the program, you've memorized what you need anyway so it's more like studying than cheating. At first it was automating homework, then I made dopewars on it with a whole menu and everything.
Vector is almost always better - why's linked list still taught in CS?
$150 for 8MB stick for me. Had to install it myself because I couldn't afford it and installation. 
This will be pretty hard. You will have to make your script look like a human using a browser. Most likely you will need javascript engine to run the various scripts. Your script need to behave like a human, scrolling, readings slowly, opening multiple tabs, clicking links and ads, etc. &amp;#x200B; I think the best tool for this would be to hack your add blocker so it will generate ad revenue on certain sites - while you are browsing them, without showing any of the ads. This will cost you more traffic and may risk your privacy since you need to actually download the javascript crap from the ads network which good ad blockers avoid.
It's not end of life in 2019, in fact, they're going to release 3.4.10 3/2019, the final release. It's in "security fix only" mode. It's still going to be usable and supported for a long time.
It's funny, I just wrote the reverse- it takes an image and imposes a CGA color palette on the image.
Thanks for the reply! I was hoping for a simpler solution but this is the best one I've heard of. This is a good starting point. Quick question - do you know of any resources on setting up an environment like this?
Front end is definitely my end goal. I’m currently in IT and automation tools and UI are my passions. I like taking something complicated and making it as easy as possible. 
Python is simpler and more consistent. Modern JS is cool, but you have to understand all these weird syntax quirks to get there (`this` is inscrutable), so it’s a harder slog. 
&gt; The TI-86 is a programmable graphing calculator introduced in 1997 and produced by Texas Instruments. I'm pretty sure you mean ti-85 I did the same. I programmed my physics lessons to solve for gravity problems, given an arbitrary input. My physics teacher said the same: If you can program it, you already understand it sufficiently.
`this` is just fired anytime a function is invoked and is passed implicitly to the constructor anytime it is called with `new`, right? So instead of a `def __init__(self, *args):` method to use as the constructor for a class, it’s instantiated and `this` is available for assignment anytime for arts in the call.
With all the responses I really appreciate them. I know I should post this in Java, but I have an Android APK that I need help with making some changes to. Not sure if anyone can assist?
There's nothing getting overridden so there doesn't even need to be an __init__ redefined (though you've given a good case for using one)
Oh, that totally makes sense to. I've always had to override __init__ so I always had to make a super() call. Well, you learn something new every day.
thanks - in my own testing, i was unable to run even the example code via Python 3.6 on MacOSX! :( Love the idea but I was unable to make much sense out of how this library works.
Python is easier but JS pays waaaaaaaaay more and has way more jobs. Learn js and you're ready to tackle all the different frameworks and npm modules that are the rage right now. Python not so much. Eventually both,start with js.
Link lists are a really easy way for new programmers to learn to think about pointers (or references for a language like Python that doesn't directly expose the real pointers). Without that knowledge, it is impossible to understand more complicated data structures like search trees or graphs.
What do you want to do? I would say Python first then JavaScript. I use both and enjoy using both but with Python I think you can build things quicker in the beginning and keep the momentum going. If you want to internalize language agnostic concepts start with python.
What are some quirks in Python? FYI I'm like 1/3 way through Learn Python the Hard Way for context
Python. Search is an important part of coding. Especially when you start. When you search for JS topics, you often get solutions that are client-side, browser-based, and mixed with HTML. The intermingling of browser issues makes it harder to get a clear coding answer. When you search for Python topics, you get pure Python. 
Quirks? Local/global variable naming shadow is unintuitive for beginners and bites everyone at some point. There are dark, neglected corners of the standard library that don't work as advertised or are embarrassing difficult and clunky compared to alternatives. (I'm thinking `requests` vs `urllib`, `arrow` vs `datetime.datetime.date`.) Python still has perhaps 1/10 as many quirks as most other languages. C++ and Javascript are extreme where quirks are the norm and consistency is an unexpected serendipity. 
This is more likely to hurt the site, who's ad network are running a lot more than an r-pi to analyse data and won't take kindly to fraud if you do anything that moves the needle for the site owner. It's a nice thought of course but I'd recommend against this one!
Cython does the same and is more popular, thus has better support (up to Python 3.7). Cython can compile both Python and Cython code to C.
Thx bro 
Thx bro
 tup = (1, 2, 3, []) tup[3].append(4) # Works fine tup[3].extend([5, 6, 7]) Works fine tup[3] += [8, 9, 10] # Raises TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment print(tup[3]) # [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] - it still worked, even though it raised an error Applying an augmented assignment operator is a three-step process: 1. Evaluate the left-hand argument. 2. Call the augmented-assignment magic method (`__iadd__` for in-place add in this case), which returns the result of the operation. 3. Re-assign the new result to what the left-hand side was. Augmented assignment operators are supposed to try to apply the left-hand side, and return the modified left-hand side if possible, or else return a new object with the operation done on it. This is += on a list modifies it in-place, but += also works on immutable types like tuples and strings. my_list = [1, 2, 3] same_list = my_list # Another reference to the same list to verify it's modified in-place my_list += [4, 5, 6] print(my_list) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] print(same_list) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] print(my_list is same_list) # True my_tuple = (1, 2, 3) same_tuple = my_tuple # By the end these will point to different objects my_tuple += (4, 5, 6) print(my_tuple) # (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) print(same_tuple) # (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) print(my_tuple is same_tuple) # False Because of this, the code for the original example looks more like this. temp_var = foo[bar] temp_var = temp_var.__iadd__(baz) foo[bar] = temp_var And now our TypeError, and why it still modified the list, is more clear. `list.__iadd__` modifies the list in-place and returns itself, but the last assignment happens anyway, raising the error. This just one of a few examples where Python, the language of "explicit is better than implicit" and "no special case is worth breaking the rule," implicitly does surprising things to account for special cases. A better way to handle this (imo) would be to have `__iadd__` return NotImplemented if the left side can't modify itself, in which case Python calls `__add__` and assigns the result. A tuple containing a list would work as expected, and if you replace the list with something immutable like another tuple, you get the TypeError. Another special-case that can catch people is handling of multiple arguments in `__getitem__`/`__setitem`/`__delitem__`. `foo[bar, baz]` is not `foo.__getitem__(bar, baz)` but `foo.__getitem__((bar, baz))` - if more than one argument is passed, they're packed into a tuple and passed as one parameter. Now one-argument subscripting is a special case where the argument isn't a 1-tuple, but just the value, meaning it's impossible to tell whether your method was passed two arguments, or one argument that happened to be a 2-tuple. Yet another case: `__setattr__`/`__delattr__` handle every attribute, but `__getattr__` only handles missing attributes. `__getattribute__` handles all attributes, but `__setattribute__` and `__delattribute__` don't exist. For descriptors, `__get__` is called when you access the class attribute, and the passed the owning class, but `__set__` and `__delete__` aren't. That seems to have been put in place specifically for classmethod and staticmethod. Python has a few warts like that that seem to be put in for specific features in the standard library. JavaScript's entire type system is a wart made of warts, so I'd definitely recommend Python over JS, but neither is perfect.

I would learn Python first. As a language it’s very focused on there being a ‘right’ (pythonic) way to do things. You will learn far better habits if you start with Python than if with a language like JavaScript that is more than happy to let you mangle it. 
This was actually my favorite talk of the conference! He lists some really good resources. One I've been trying out lately is cosmic-ray, which everyone should use for testing!
Fucking string encoding...
I would say yes. I had a basic level of python from self learning than took a course about data science in python. I didn't become a data scientist but the course enhanced my python level and allowed me to learn data science stuff that I use everyday at my job (automotive engineer doing simulations so I have to deal my lots of data)
As other have said, Python is a saner and broadly more useful language. To add to that, the JS *community* is also known for practices the rest of the world considers nuts. In particular, they really seem to hate writing actual JavaScript, and a lot of the code is written in other, similar but different languages that they then compile into JavaScript. So, join almost any other community first before the JS one. You really don’t want to internalise the way they go about stuff. All that said, there’s no way around learning JS simply because of its monopoly of the web brower.
Very cool trivia, thanks for sharing. I wonder if one could also override `__import__()` to selectively reject certain imports, to accomplish the same result. I'm sure you can override the definition in a single module, but I wonder if you can override it globally... Is there a way to override builtins globally?
Question A: ObjectOriented means that you represent with classes the "things" you are working with, instead of writing functions that handle non-organized data. In your case you have 2 variables for each point, so you can make a Point object that store the coordinates and make the code a little bit more organized. Also, you have 2 functions that do calculations, it would be good to organize them inside a "Calculator" class. OOP is not always needed, but the more your programs become big, the more you'll need it.

[Realpython on oop](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/) [datacamp on OOP](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/python-oop-tutorial) &amp;#x200B; Question B: No, you don't have to change language, there are a few libraries that let you build GUIs around your features. Just like you `import math` you can `import tkinter` and start to build a GUI. Another way is to expose your features into a small local webserver, so you use your calculation functions from a browser. This is a little more to learn to get things done I think, but it's fun.

so a few tasks for you: \- make a small robot that understands homework and solves it \- go back in time and send that robot to the young myself back in school :P
I'd say for absolute beginners, www.codecademy.com. 
Being able to shadow built-ins is the quirk that I wish would not exist. It's so easy as a beginner to give a list the variable name of `list` and then find out that you can't use the built-in `list()` function any more.
Hey, that's a good first project. Maybe you can improve on in by using a database to store the state of websites you crawled. For example you download a page. Extract the thing you want and store it in a database. Looking through a database can be way faster then looking through a file. Learning about database is really helpfull for other project too. Like storing user data from a website or a list of available items in a shop.
By vector I'm assuming you mean a [dynamic array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array) like C++ and Java's vectors? Pretty sure most Python programmers are comfortable with dynamic arrays already, given that lists are dynamic arrays. Anyways, there are *many* instances where you might want structures more similar to a linked list than an array. I use `deque` from `collections` all the time, which is a doubly-linked list (hence the name, double-ended queue: deque). Simply put, queues are an immediately obvious example of where linked-lists are a no-brainer and arrays are just not the right tool. A lot of useful SW constructs use queues: logging, message busses, debouncing, multithreaded task management, and so on. Why would you want CS students to not learn queues? Seems silly IMO. 
**Dynamic array** In computer science, a dynamic array, growable array, resizable array, dynamic table, mutable array, or array list is a random access, variable-size list data structure that allows elements to be added or removed. It is supplied with standard libraries in many modern mainstream programming languages. Dynamic arrays overcome a limit of static arrays, which have a fixed capacity that needs to be specified at allocation. A dynamic array is not the same thing as a dynamically allocated array, which is an array whose size is fixed when the array is allocated, although a dynamic array may use such a fixed-size array as a back end. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
That is totally useless piece of a knowledge
But it is still cool imo. :D
Can you make it import something else instead?
Sure - [import hooks](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#import-hooks) are probably the better way, but you could override `builtins.__import__`: import builtins builtins.__import__ = lambda name, globals={}, locals={}, fromlist=[], level=-1: 'Hello, this is ' + name &gt;&gt;&gt; import sys &gt;&gt;&gt; sys 'Hello, this is sys' 
Perhaps, but it serves to illustrate the degree to which pythons runtime is flexible and adjustable. If you are trying to write a game or a program to calculate interest rates then this trick is of no use. But if you are trying to build an import manager library for python or a security system that tries to make it safe to run untrusted code then this is just the sort of thing you might want to know about.
I agree it is all about adjusting expectations, both on the side of the open source maintainers and on the occasional contributors. I would add a few personal thoughts: why I do open source, why it is fun, and why it is so scary. I admit I love contributing to open source for the wider impact it has. It is an honor to contribute even a typo fix in the docs to a project used by millions of people. Even more so fixing bugs or doing support work so that the project can make timely releases. It is usually fun to solve an intellectual challenge, and pitch my solution to the best mind in the field. There are few things as satisfying as seeing my code merged. Better than a over 30 bonus in Words with Friends, or breaking a deadlock in Suduko. Sorry, I don’t play Fortnite so I can’t make a more hip reference. On of the things I find scary is staring into the face of infinity. There is always more to do. Just take a look at the number of open issues in any well-used package. Each of those will take hours to solve, including writing a proper test, isolating the failure, proposing a solution, thinking about possible side effects, where else the same issue might occur, refactoring old code, discovering new issues the fix uncovers, and getting other maintainers to agree the solution is appropriate. Rinse and repeat. Just like reading reddit, I need to know how to set borders, how to limit the satisfaction I get from it to find a life balance. Especially when I know there is a user somewhere frustrated by the issue they raised, and how just a little more of my time could possibly help them. I think this is true of any addictive activity. I really stand in awe of the people who dedicate so much of their free time to contributing to open source. Especially since many of them are obviously top tier programmers who are in such great demand. So thanks Brett and all the others who are part of what you do. More kindness would go a long way to making it even more satisfying, and is a good thing to promote in general. (Disclosure - I too am hooked on the drug, I’m not sure my family would agree that I get the balance right)
Sure. Just assign it.
Thanks ! I'll check it out. 
What can it do that JS can't? That doesn't sound right given the fact that JS is the language of the web and we have Node..
Nice work! I think there's definitely some room for improvement in terms of readability and scalability, but overall, it's not a bad implementation :). Someone else mentioned dataclasses, which would be nice for the nodes. Just so you're aware, the reason why this is nice is because you wouldn't have to write out all the comparator methods, you get it for free. Another way to do this prior to 3.7 is to wrap the class with `functools.total_ordering()`; this requires you only to specify an `__eq__()` and *one* of the others, and it will provide the rest. See the docs [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.total_ordering) (but since 3.7 is out, no reason not to use dataclasses). --- You define an `__iter__()` method so that you can walk the list---but rarely use this in your methods! Seems like an easy win to make your code shorter and easier to read. For e.g., in `__iter__()` you do: while current is not self.__tail: yield current.data but then in `__len__()` you do while current is not self.__tail: # walk the list count += 1 # count the nodes current = current.next and similar with some of the other methods. Your `__len__()` method could simply be: def __len__(self): return sum(1 for _ in self) Atually, len is maybe a bad example, as you could really just keep track of that in an attribute and just increment/decrement whenever you append/insert/delete. I would suggest doing that, as it's a trivial add, but makes `len` a constant time operation. You do use this to your advantage in your `__repr__()`: return f"[{', '.join([str(item) for item in self])}]" Although here I would make a couple comments; first, it's the `repr()` method, so it makes more sense to call `repr()` on the subitems and not `str()`. But more importantly, your object is iterable, you're already iterating through it, you're displaying it to look like a list. You could just `return repr(list(self))`. --- Along the same lines, you now see why you might keep a separate iterator class. When you iterate through your linked list, you just want to yield the `data`, not the actual `Node` object. At least, for end users. But maybe for your own use, you might want to actually yield the `Node` objects themselves. This can be done pretty trivially in your case by defining `__next__()` on your `Node` class, or creating a `LinkedListIterator` class or similar to traverse, just for your own ease of maintainability. --- In terms of readability, improvements could be made on the docstrings for your functions. Currently you define a `help()` method, which IMO is a little pointless. In python, `help()` is a built-in function which will show you the docstrings of your implemented methods from a class. For e.g.: &gt;&gt;&gt; class A: ... def __init__(self, a): ... """Negates the input a and stores it""" ... self.a = -a ... def another_method(self, whatever): ... """Does things.""" ... return self.a * 5 ... &gt;&gt;&gt; help(A) shows: Help on class A in module __main__: class A(builtins.object) | Methods defined here: | | __init__(self, a) | Negates the input a and stores it | | another_method(self, whatever) | Does things. | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | Data descriptors defined here: | | __dict__ | dictionary for instance variables (if defined) | | __weakref__ | list of weak references to the object (if defined) So, you don't need to define a help method which describes the actions. Just use docstring conventions, and you get what you want automatically. Also, your comment spacing is kind of all over the place and hard to read. I'd suggest sticking to a style that is clear, easy to read, and doesn't distract from the code. IMO that means aligning comments when there's multiple comments near each other, or just placing them in-line with your code, less at the end of lines. --- Someone else mentioned being unsure of using `index` in the `Node`, and I agree. These indices should be managed only when actually being used. If you think about OOP principles, it doesn't make sense for a `Node` to keep track of it's index, it really should be agnostic of where it is in the chain aside from its neighbors. All of your methods that look at an index ask a node for it's index, instead of by comparing how far down the chain it was; this is introducing possibilities of weird bugs that are probably just not necessary. --- You use dunders for head and tail, with a link to PEP 8, but actually you are not following PEP 8's recommendations here. PEP 8 says to use single underscores for "private" attributes in Python, not double underscores. PEP 8 suggests dunders *only* when you're worried about subclassed attribute names getting accidentally overwritten. This isn't the case for your implementation, so you should be using single underscores here. And this is super minor but 8 spaces is pretty uncommon in Python; PEP 8 suggests 4 spaces per indent level which you'll see in the standard lib and most Python projects/libs, Google's style guides suggest 2 spaces. --- Lastly, I'm not sure how exact you wanted to get with copying `list`s behavior, but you're missing a few of the implemented magic methods for lists (you can view them all in an interpreter with `help(list)`), some of them would be nice to see on a linked list (`__reversed__()` for e.g.). Otherwise I hope the feedback above is helpful and constructive, and I hope I was able to communicate the suggestions positively. As it stands, it's a solid class with all the right methods!
I came to this post because I'm searching for anaconda in linux, I'm coming from windows. so anaconda is a big no in linux?
Regarding python, with only courses you will just get a proof that you followed the lessons. I don't know if there is a python test to evaluate one's ability to code in python. &amp;#x200B; It is better to have something to show, in my case it is an application to make my job better
I disagree with having this many comments. It hinders code readability.
For a language that promotes "explicit is better than implicit" and "no special l case is worth breaking the rule," Python has many instances of implicitly handling special cases. Here's a quick preview you can run line-by-line in a REPL: # Function default arguments are evaluated once (aka "mutable default argument" problem) def append(value, to_list=[]): to_list.append(value) return to_list l1 = append(1) print(l1) # [1] l2 = append(2) print(l2) # [1, 2] print(l1) # [1, 2] - it changed! # error: it succeeded (aka "augmented assignment operators are weird") my_list = [1, 2, 3] my_list += [4, 5, 6] print(my_list) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] my_tuple = ([1, 2, 3],) # Tuple of just one item, a list my_tuple[0] += [4, 5, 6] # TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment print(my_tuple[0]) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] - so even though it raised an error, it worked... There are three more that are difficult to explain succinctly, as well as full explanations for why these two do what they do and sample code for them all, [here](https://repl.it/@cynthesized/PythonQuirks).
Impossible? You learn references the first time you use a mutable object in python. For example you put a thing into a list, change the thing and it's magically different everywhere.
Hello everyone. This is the first time I've used this subreddit before. Basically, I need to create a program that checks the age that a user enters, and gives a discount based on whether or not the user is a child. For this first step, I need to check that the age is valid. As long as I enter an integer, the code works just fine. However, if I enter a string, the problem runs into an error - &gt; ValueError: could not convert string to float: Is there something here that I am doing incorrectly? If so, what do I do to fix this problem?
You probably want to look into try and except to handle the error more elegantly

Selenium is usually used as a scrapping or testing tool. It allows you to drive a real Web browser. While this seems like an odd plan, that would be where I would start.
This is a good course to learn programming with Python: https://www.coursera.org/learn/python Edx and Coursera offer courses by university, that means there's usually a minimum of quality assurance. My experience with Udacity has also been good. All of the these let you audit the course for free, with access to all course material, so the investment here need only be your time. Courses from Udemy vary more in quality. Some can be pretty good. There's no free option.
Python has an interface (although it leaves a lot to be desired) to its parsing mechanism through `ast` module. You could hook into this module (for example, by supplying custom grammar), and if the transformation is easy (i.e. you can accomplish something like `from past import useless_but_fancy_36_feature`), then your rewriting becomes not so difficult. Still, that'd be a lot of work. (The only real worthwhile update between 3.4 and 3.7 was the security update of TLS implementation, and that is also questionable, but this is what you get for trying to be in vogue).
I was in the same boat myself for a while but discovering "automate the boring stuff" (book on practical python applications, provided online on author's site for free) and messing around on code wars periodically helped me set a pace for myself. Would highly recommend at least the book, I find practical solutions a lot more motivating than abstract concepts alone.

Yeah, I think the debate of desktop vs web development is decidedly leaning towards web development as a more prudent choice especially for newbies. Good for the resume, ton of tutorials, great overall skills to develop in a flexible environment, so on and so on. I would start small, with the minimal set of pieces. You can always “upgrade” to other technologies and frameworks. This is kind of old school, but install Apache2 and run python scripts out of the cgi-bin. You may have to do some configuration, and I’ve found all this stuff is way easier on Linux, so if you are on windows, get virtualbox and launch a Linux VM. Ubuntu is popular. Actually if you are looking for a learning environment, you could just buy a raspberry pi and said and done $70 ($35 for pi, other for casing and power cord). Check out etcher for creating the raspbian image. You can’t beat the “power on to internet browsing” time. I think it beats my phone time. All in all, once you know how to do this stuff, it’s easy. But there are a lot of gotchas along the way that they don’t tell you about. Welcome to computers. It gets easier and you learn over time not to get so frustrated. Everyone talks about how easy things are, but there it doesn’t work for you, you get mad and blame them, and then yourself for being dumb, then you start to lose hope, and then one day you realize that it’s just the way it is. There are too many OS and environments variables within those OSs, and too many dependencies for there to be one answer. Containers tried to solve this, but now you dealing with complexities arising from dealing with containers. You can’t win when the digital world grows in complexity faster than how fast you can hear about and learn new skills/technologies/languages/frameworks. So stay the course. Recognize when you are spiking your own blood pressure and take a walk. Sometimes stepping away is more productive than grinding away. I need to remind myself if this almost everyday, but at least I am partially aware of it. That sure beats my younger days of endlessly beating myself up. It so much easier when you offer yourself some compassion and patience. Sorry for the inspirational speech, but it’s something I wish I were told when I first started out. 
We're all consenting adults here... Except when we're not.
This was great, some of the stuff here is actually well known now and the metaprogramming comments are now more mainstream! Couldn't see the count on the website, but was #34 the rot13 one, because that was hilarious

Hello! I'm a bot! It looks to me like your post might be better suited for r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. That said, I am a bot and it is hard to tell. I highly recommend posting your question there. Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster. Show /r/learnpython the code you have tried and describe where you are stuck. **[Be sure to format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F)** and include which version of python and what OS you are using. *** ^(this bot is written and managed by /u/IAmKindOfCreative) ^(This bot is currently under development and experiencing changes to improve its usefulness)
Sounds very interesting! Would you share it when you done? :)
Can this be used to create multiple instances of a module via `del sys.modules["re"]`?
Not if they block sys.
Shaking my head. This website... while it technically loads, needs a shit ton of work. The interface is t setup right for my iPhone so it’s all wonky side scrolling to see. The Chuck Norris jokes are done horribly wrong! Do you even know how to tell jokes and why is your name in the joke? So yes, it technically works but I would post it as “under heavy construction” and really, really rework the aesthetic look and flow. Congrats and please rework the UX, ui. I will say it’s kinda cool you did this with Django. Source code?
Looks like you need a Windows update.
&gt; That is totally useless piece of a knowledge Not really. It's great it you want to backdoor a python project
 --python=`which python2.3` --python=`which python3.7` 
Yea, that sounds like a terrible start to a tutorial. It’s also completely unnecessary, pip can install to your home space just fine. Also, greetings from another Maryland grad!
Anaconda certainly works in Linux. But there's also no real upside to it IMHO (i.e. anaconda only kinda made sense on windows prior to binary wheels), but plenty of cons[1] to using it on Linux/OSX where it's always been easy to install from source or a package manager. As an aside, I also haven't used anaconda on windows since binary wheels were allowed on pypi. [1] compiled using an old version of GCC for maximum compatibility which sometimes causes trouble with things like scipy, doesn't link system-level shared libraries, conda envs superfluous with venv, etc.
I was thinking of mock.patch. It does this sort of thing all the time.

Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
The platform is not that good I agree, but there are still lots of good content there. You just have to find the good ones from lots of bad ones
 &gt;&gt;&gt; sys.modules['re'] = "R{}".format("E"*30) &gt;&gt;&gt; import re &gt;&gt;&gt; re REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE FTFTFYFY 
I've seen that format before, but it seemed longer to type than the `%s` method since the `.format` was always required. At least with `%s`, if I only have one variable I don't need the parenthesis.
Python's `deque` isn't a conventional linked list with a node object for every value. It does *use* a linked list, but it's a list of larger blocks of data. There's a comment at the start of [the implementation](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/d700f97b627989d41cd4629dc02969f9a6b56d2f/Modules/_collectionsmodule.c#L24): /* Data for deque objects is stored in a doubly-linked list of fixed * length blocks. This assures that appends or pops never move any * other data elements besides the one being appended or popped. That means that it's not as easy or efficient to handle an addition or deletion in the middle of a deque as in a linked list, as you likely need to move a bunch of other values around, just like in an array (i.e. a Python `list`). For a `deque`'s normal operations though (adding or deleting from either end), it is great.
Thanks for your feedback! Working on a README atm.
Thanks for the feedback! That's on my ToDo!
There should be a subreddit for such Evil Code 😁
Start with JS. Python is so much nicer that it'll ruin you for other languages 😋
I've no knowledge about OOP but the bare minimum! :D (no idea what \`super() actually is) I wanted to inherit the \`requests.Session\` to have persistent cookies when requesting data. I also think you're right about the \`self.headers\` and \`self.timeout\` regrading requests. good catch! Regrading \`lxml\`, I used to import both \`html\` to work with HTML and \`etree\` to work with XML but that was redundant since it \`html\` depends on \`etree\` anyway. One last thing, I prefer XPath over CSSSelect. I think it's more natural for writing queries :D
Nice.
You don't need to do that yourself. Look at the combine command and the `[paths]` section of the configuration file.
...can you do this with builtin? If you change the value of builtin, then import it, do you lose builtin?
As does this one: https://xkcd.com/1987/
I graduated in 2011 during the labor crisis. I spent years, doing hundreds of interviews, for a wide range of jobs. I've spent the last four years pivoting into dev/data science. It took 1.5 years to get my foot in the door in a researchy oriented roll. After two years there it took me a year of self study and application to get my foot in the door in a dev oriented roll. I've spent 2.5 years in this job doing nights and weekends of self study so I can measure up to my peers in programming ability. Overall I've received like 3 big breaks out of maybe 300 attempts, and I've only been given those breaks because i could credibly signal the thousands of hours I've spent learning. Coding is fucking hard, everything worth doing is hard. We over index on the rare prodigies, but for most of us it's just thousands of hours of slow frustrating incremental progress. Then when you fail try again harder.

hi
Personally I'd implement this as a web app - the browser can do everything you need graphics-wise and you get portability and online multiplayer (almost) automatically, plus no installation needed. You could write the server in Flask or Django (I'd recommend Flask if you're unfamiliar with either) though the real game code would have to be javascript (or something that transpiles to javascript). As an added bonus, you'd be learning some really useful/marketable skills (if that's a goal). If you're set on Python-only (or want a local app), then I'd recommend looking into doing it in PyQT with Cairo for the graphics - that will let you develop a natural feeling GUI app with reasonable performance. PyGame is the other major option. Personally I'd shy away from that for this project, but you should probably look into it to see if it resonates with you.
The thing is, this is not a regular expression.
There's a stdlib module that upgrades itself behind the scenes if it can. For the life of me can't recall which one though, I think it's related to xml. 
[https://www.fastcompany.com/90137157/the-hardest-working-office-design-in-america-encrypts-your-data-with-lava-lamps](https://www.fastcompany.com/90137157/the-hardest-working-office-design-in-america-encrypts-your-data-with-lava-lamps)
`python -m SimpleHttpServer` start a local http server
do a `print(os.listdir())` just before you fetch the resource to see if it's really there.
I was originally thinking that it would be better suited as a web application as well. I have some prior experience with web development (small tribute page and a web app that shows you the benefits of not smoking, including how much money you could save per/year). I'm definitely not opposed to it, as JavaScript would allow me to 'flip' the cards and whatnot pretty easily. I will hold your recommendations in high regard, but I am still curious as to what input anyone else out there has to bring to the table. Thank you so much, NoLemurs!
This isn't an issue in 3, is it?
There probably isn't one, but if there was, I'd post my libraries, https://github.com/t184256/mutants and https://github.com/t184256/hacks there. Maybe you'd like them!
How could it not be?
Yeah, unfortunately video does not really allow for that in most codecs like you guessed. A lot of videos encode in the time domain as well and require some reconstruction. A common case in a lot of codecs is storing frame differences instead of frames. There is a lot of nuance and not greatly enforced standards in most of these containers. It sucks. A common format to use when editing video (on like Premiere or whatever) is Prores, which is basically uncompressed and fast to read, at the expense of way larger file sizes. I imagine similar filetypes might actually allow for nice reading into a program, but the standard for people working with video if you need speed is to split the video into frames before you process them.
Well then.
There might not be a use case for assigning a module to None, but messing around with sys.modules is useful in certain scenarios. For example, in [AREPL](https://github.com/almenon/arepl-vscode) I unload user modules by deleting them from sys.modules after each run. See https://github.com/Almenon/AREPL-backend/blob/3b949d340dda52b7cbd7f2fd7857e88e3344ae22/python/pythonEvaluator.py#L253
I updated [arepl-vscode](https://github.com/Almenon/AREPL-vscode) to support python 3.7 and stderr. Arepl is a real-time python scratchpad for vscode. See it in action [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Almenon/AREPL-vscode/master/areplDemoGif2.gif). 
I switch between JS and Python frequently for my open source projects and man the lack of index slicing in JS is infuriating. Using slice or splice is so cumbersome in comparison.
In fact, a common trick (sanctioned by the core dev team!) is to define a single class within a file, then at the end of the file write `sys.modules[__name__] = MyClass()`. This makes the class object *replace* the module, which allows you to define things like `__str__` or `__getattr__` or `__call__` on it 
I think one the main causes of this are tutorials that don't teach the user to name their lists to describe the items in the lists rather than the list themselves. I've seen a lot of people use `myList`, `list`, `list1` when they should have names like `urls`, `customer_names` or simply `numbers`.
I would highly recommend [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) for games. GDScript has syntax heavily influenced by python. Its FOSS software.
You’re doing it wrong, it’s “Hello, world!”
What about inplace replacing? nums = list(range(10)) start_id = id(nums) nums[:] = (i * 2 for i in nums) nums[::-1] = nums nums[:2] = 100,100 end_id = id(nums) assert start_id == end_id 
Negative rounding is very cool and quite unknown: &gt;&gt;&gt; round(1499, -2) 1500

Since your end goal is front-end learn JavaScript, then get the basics of OOP and slowly switch to TypeScript. TS will be very popular. React is also switching to TS. Angular already uses TS anyway. You can also use TS for very large backend project. I'm doing it. If you have math/stat background and have interests ML/DS field, Python knowledge is essential today. However, JS is also making inroads into ML/AI field slowly. You can use Python for API development, scraping, microservices, software testing, etc. I have been using Python for all these tasks for several years, but I found JS is at least 10x faster and TS code is very clean &amp; readable. 
Then, just use debian :p
Thank you for your input! I've been looking at Godot on Steam for awhile now.
inertia/recognition. pyramid seems like an objectively better framework than both Django and flask to me at this point. We use flask at my work because I wanted sqlalchemy (which nixed Django) and flask was the other framework I knew. Now we're probably going to use it indefinitely because that's where all the experience is, despite my being reasonably negative about flask nowadays. these days, I feel like there are better (yet less mature) frameworks like hug, apistar, and molton which better fit my mold of an ideal library.
I have less experience with 3 (unfortunately) and so can not comment.
I updated the post and added a `if __name__` block. But for the `Queue`, I don't *expect* it to work across processes. I don't want it to be reflected in subprocesses at all! Configuration should not leak from parents to child processes, but it does in Python's default setup.
Troubleshooting a program to dig through a self-contained database for data arrays- I can't get it to output any array but there first one, though. I'm pretty new to the language and programming in general so it's probably user error- just a matter of having my if loops take precedence over one another
thank you I'll try over there
Eviler Python: ```python (lambda fc=(lambda n: [c for c in object.__subclasses__() if c.__name__ == n][0]): (lambda func=fc('function'), code=fc('code'), bc=b'\x01': (lambda pre=() if isinstance(b'', str) else (0,): func(code(*(pre + (0, 0, 0, 0, bc, (), (), (), '', '', 0, b''))), {})() )() )() )() ```

Slow down and explain what you are trying to do. Do you actually have a module that will compile? Also I reccomend using an IDE like spyder or vbcode, I favor those. 
Great! Read the sidebar!
As someone completely on the outside of this. What is supreme and why does it need a bot?

thanks lol
It was a goto (via an external module)...
Ask user to obtain that privilege? It is very dangerous to make Python a `setuid` program (but you can check if you are given admin permissions via `os.getuid()`), so, realistically, your options are to either ask user to run your program as admin, or to outsource file operations to another program (eg. use `subprocess` to call `sudo`). All of the above assumes Linux as OS.
Thank you, helps alot &lt;3
To be honest, I don't know. I only have the scraper at the moment. In the past I've compared home team home stats with away team away stats and that's been useful. I still have a lot to learn though. Some of the examples listed on the page below look interesting though! https://nealcaren.github.io/python-tutorials/ 
python -m http.server
&gt; I wanted sqlalchemy (which nixed Django) You can [integrate SQLAlchemy with Django](https://github.com/shosca/django-sorcery) :-)
what's this and where can I RTFM ?
https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
[Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/lavarand-in-production-the-nitty-gritty-technical-details/)
The bulk of our production code is pyramid. Only places we’ve moved away from it is for asyncio based frameworks 
The thing with Django is that you can do everything with it which makes it harder to learn. But once you learn it you realize that nearly every time someone says to use Pyramid or Flask or whatever...Django can do it at least as well if not better.
LOL don't care much about documentation eh ? I was wondering why this was downvoted then I saw your project page. README.md can use some more info. and docstrings please.
Should be `python3 -m http.server` so it works not just for those people running Arch.
I think that when a better tool/technique pops up in the js world, the entire community tends to move and abandon the predecessor. Maybe because of the relative single purposefulness of the language, which is web stuff. It seems to not happen in the python community, that may explain this problem. Python 3 is about 10 years and people still use V2.x
https://xkcd.com/1171/
Function annotations were introduced in Python 3.0 so you can leave your annotations in. 
Python for sure. After becoming proficient in Python, JavaScript has been a breeze to pick up. 
That's not terribly difficult to get around, though. import sys as old_sys def get_builtin_module(name): object = (0).__class__.__base__ BuiltinImporter, = [t for t in object.__subclasses__() if (t.__module__, t.__name__) == ('_frozen_importlib', 'BuiltinImporter')] return BuiltinImporter().load_module('sys') assert get_builtin_module('sys') is old_sys 
Why does it have to be svg? Why not just a gif or jpeg?
An alternative, using cheap DVB-T dongle instead of webcam: https://github.com/pwarren/rtl-entropy
This was less about doing something useful anyway, and only to understand a little bit more about python. What exactly do you mean with "injecting `__path__`" though? I've searched the documentation entry of the import system of python 3.7.0 for `__path__` and found nothing that could achieve the same, unless you are dealing with packages. And i don't even know if it would work for them. 
Something like this. Very useful for plugins, but also can be abused for multiple loading: import os import re import sys from types import ModuleType def split_paths(files): # because there's still no OrderedSet path = []; path_set = set() mods = []; mods_set = set() for f in files: d = os.path.dirname(f) m, _ = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(f)) if d not in path_set: path.append(d); path_set.add(d) if m not in mods_set: mods.append(m); mods_set.add(m) return path, mods def create_package(name, *files): assert name not in sys.modules pkg = sys.modules[name] = ModuleType(name, 'synthetic package') pkg.__path__, modules = split_paths(files) # or you could do this lazily for m in modules: __import__(pkg.__name__+'.'+m) del pkg.__path__ return pkg foo = create_package(__name__ + '.foo', re.__file__) assert foo.re is not re assert dir(foo.re) == dir(re) 
Go for stats, if you are programing you should pick it fast enough. Also some linear algebra should help
Thanks for your comment. Congrats on the job!
Part of me really wants to know what this does by running it but I also don’t want to run it
I see a lot of resources I currently using on here but quick a few I haven't heard of. Thanks! 
Your story doesn't seem to be so uncommon. 
Yes, I have hear similar stories. Gives me hope. 
know anyone? :)
Some advice to make it more pythonic: - while True - don't run the paste function twice per loop. Run it once and store it in a variable. - for writing to a file there's no need to redirect stdout. Instead of your print just call f.write(some_string)

So simple, yet so elegant. Give us a walkthrough, through the step by step logic you used to get the code!

ok
Copying text with line breaks might become annoying to deal with and distinguish in the text file. The simplest thing would be to use something that you likely wouldn't be copying as a separator (such as a line of $ signs). Personally, I'd probably import some libraries to help escape all potentially problem-causing chars in the string, and then store it in a plaintext JSON object/array/list - this has the benefit of distinguishing clearly between each clipboard item, but also allows the data to be easily used by another program potentially in the future.
I use numpy. It's a mistake to throw out numpy because it's missing one thing. Quaternions can be implemented using a class and can look like numpy arrays.
SVG are much better in this context. They can be re-sized to any size and still have great quality, much unlike gif or jpeg. SVG works like any other image in an img tag so what is so wrong with it being svg?
Worked for me. Here's a direct link to the page's [video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=H4SS9yVWJYA)

I showed my reasoning for why I wrote the code in the demonstration video that I linked. Let me know if my reasoning is sound.
That sucks ! C++ will move up soon and python a toy language will just move down

Try/except's else clause. In general the pattern is somewhat discouraged (as you can usually design around it and it seems weird to a lot), but it can simplify some of those weird corner cases that you don't have control over. Everything is a tool in the right hands, after all. Example: try: x = maybe_raises_some_error() except SomeError: # handle error case else: # invoked when an exception wasn't raised. It's simple, but I've found a lot of people don't know it.
&gt; You have to be a little careful since and will only execute until a False is returned. Indeed. A number of coding standards discourage this kind of chaining. see [Here](http://www.codingstandard.com/rule/5-1-6-do-not-code-side-effects-into-the-right-hand-operands-of-sizeof-typeid-or-a-function-passed-to-condition_variablewait/) for an example. The reasons cited as applicable beyond C++ for a number of cases (maintainability, testing).
Created a pull request with a few changes to make it more Pythonic.
&gt;I just recently started to learn Python on CodeAcademy and wanted to know if any of y’all found any merit in the course? It would be helpful if you provided details on why you think this way
Which way? The title of the post? (I used that for clickbait tbh)
Title
I don’t think that way. It’s clickbait; hopefully ppl have answers to the Q’s in the post.
This is awesome! Thank you. I’ll give it a look
I'm looking at it now. I'm still very new to Github and have no idea how to navigate the website, but i'm trying to comment on your code. Take a look at the comment when you can.
Thanks for taking a look, some others are helping modify the code to make it more Pythonic, so check back on github.
I am new to Python and am finding that a course on Udemy has been very helpful so far. Don’t know how it stacks up against some of the ones on CodeAcademy, but I find structured courses in general really help me with a baseline knowledge that I can expand on further with books and online resources. For me, it’s easier than trying to piece it together first 
Thank you for the advice, some redditors are helping me to make the code more pythonic. Check back in on github when you get the chance.
Thanks for the advice about using $ signs for the line separators, the code will be updated soon enough. Some redditors are helping make the code more pythonic so look at the repository again when you have the chance.
From one noob to another, what is you idea?
A few of these examples have some issues. count_zeroes() will never count any zeroes because he's comparing a string type to an integer. &gt;&gt;&gt; def count_zeros(string): ... total = 0 ... for c in string: ... if c == 0: ... total += 1 ... return total ... &gt;&gt;&gt; print(count_zeros('00102')) # Will return 3 0 It should be compared to the actual type: def count_zeros(string): total = 0 for c in string: if c == '0': total += 1 return total Or converted into the correct type: def count_zeros(string): total = 0 for c in string: if int(c) == 0: total += 1 return total Also there's never really a reason to use os.system to call other python code. Bash doesn't need to be involved. I've seen command injection on web servers through similar mechanisms, when they could have easily just imported the python code and called it directly.
&gt; pythonic is this an actual industry term? what does it mean.
You already seem to have a good start on coding in Python, but I would just make sure you have a grasp on core concepts before diving further into Machine Learning and AI (mainly stuff like list comprehension). For the data-science side of things, I would suggest looking into the Pandas package; it provides some nice data structures which can streamline your code while also making it much easier to understand. It also supports matplotlib, so you won;t have to relearn to much from that I also see you seem to have an interest in genetic analysis. If I may shamelessly plug my career, have you consider looking into Bioinformatics as a possible job? We're basically data scientists that interpret biological data (usually genetic, though their are a lot of protein and RNA focused bioinformaticians as well, and even some who work on data visualisation and education). You could look into common methods we use (mainly stuff like sequence alignment, read assembly, and cluster analysis) if you want to expand your horizons in that direction.
Learn about tensorflow, it used pretty heavily in machine learning.
People like me that don't like clickbaits because we feel cheated won't help you ;)
Which country?
Wow...thanks for such a great advise and the other stuff.... :D and yeah! I also want to learn new libraries and stuff like Scikit learn and especially pandas as well...Well! actually this project like it was more like a self-improvement project tho' it took 40+ hours to finish in the deadline of 3 days...But I appreciate your advise and will follow it :D. 
Yeah! indeed it's still on my list...I'm learning it now a days...and thanks for your advice.
Change the file extension to .pyw and run it again by double-clicking on the file. This will stop the command line prompt from appearing. The program will then appear to run in the background.
Working on that too! Instead of sqlite3 (which I don't know), I'm using JSON.

There are easier ways to achieve performance in python than to mangle the language. Try PyPy for instance www.pypy.org.
As PEP8 says, "A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds". Every feature is a tool, in the right hands. It's all about being mindful. I don't consider short-circuiting universally bad, just something to approach with caution.
Immutable.js may have a large number of downloads but I don’t see it used often in day to day code. It can actually be not just annoying to use (for example, Set and Map behave differently from the language’s own Set and Map) but also rather slow. I would much rather remove instances of Immutable.js than add to them.
In my country compared to java and .net jobs, python jobs are really rare but we use it as primary language at university that means something. I wonder how did Python become so popular, is it because python is really easy to understand? 
And it ignores PEP 484.
What happens if you copy binary data to the clipboard (like an image)?
Not the r/Python you're looking for
I think the op knows what Python they are on. If they're looking for a blue python, it's a reference to the Python logo. 
That's incredibly beautiful. 
I have some security concerns. I would be worried about passwords or something like that hanging out in a plain text file...
I think the popularity of Python lies in both it's low barrier to entry, ease of use, wide community, and it's utility as both a scripting language and a fully fledged application-level language. You get something like Bash, it's widely available, terse, some concepts are a little difficult to appreciate at first, but it's a great base-level scripting language, however you'd never develop a web application using it (*I hope!*). You get something like C, it's low overhead makes it great for bare-metal development, things like embedded systems. It's got quite a high-barrier of entry if you're looking to create full applications, and it's no good as a scripting language, you'd need to recompile per-target for it to be of any shareable use. Python fills those boxes whilst maintaining a really strong semantic tie to English. The typical paradigms of development (data structures, loops, inheritance) they're all easily taught/learnt in Python. Makes it a great springboard for new devs, even if they don't wish to pursue Python as a career, it's a good starting point to understand the wider development landscape. I believe Python popularity waned slightly during the 2-to-3 snafu, where older documentation/tutorials/posts didn't specify it was for 2, thus leaving some newcomers confused between 2 and 3. Although that haze seems to be lifting now. We use Python here for a lot of our automation, a lot of our Ansible work, and general day-to-day maintenance. Lot of community support out there, any of our team can go in, quickly understand what a Python script is up to. 
Evil? That's just mildly inconvenient. How about monkey-patching(technical term for what you're doing) a standard module so it launches reverse shell in a new process when it is imported or something?
To my knowledge, JavaScript has no composite, immutable types (I believe strings, ints, and floats are immutable, but I don't know of any others). So if you need a composite, immutable object in JavaScript... you *need* a library that provides them. Python has a few of them, and the ones Python includes cover a huge swath of use cases. So if you need a composite, immutable object in Python... er, you just use one.
Quality shitpost or quality joke...? Ah, whatever, have my upvote you sneaky karma snake
Might be a regional block
Why is VB.NET above C#? Is there more demand for VB.NET?
Delete this. It's stupid and contributes nothing to the sub.
I agree.
It means what the other person said it means, but it gets used generically a lot as saying something is or isn't good python code IMO. Most I hear it is when someone's looking at novice python code that's in all camel case and doing `for i in range(len(array))` and stuff like that. "This isn't very pythonic". Gentle way of saying shit python.

No, I said that about Bash. I hope no one is writing web applications in Bash.
Because nobody wants to work with VB.NET, so they can't fill those jobs, so they keep having them up. 
missing ":" ?
Oh, I completely misread that one! If someone's writing web apps in bash, he/she should be abolished from any programming circles lol
Absolutely no problem whatsoever. Sorry you're being downvoted for having misread. It'd be a sight to behold I'm sure. Just... Kindly behold it far away from any of my systems!
You can hook into code that is currently to modify objects in real time. Let's say you have `A.py`, that is always running. If you create a new thread in `A.py` that creates a socket connection to another computer that runs a script `B.py`, you can use `code.InteractiveConsole` in `A.py` to execute python code sent from `B.py`. The python code sent by `B.py` can actually make persisting changes to objects that exist in `A.py`. You could patch a program while it ran depending on what you needed to do. You can also write python scripts that have the ability to update/restart themselves while running using sockets and a few built in python modules.
Shitpost
Are they not on the list of protected Spezies? What is your motivation to post this?
Python already struggles with performance as it is. Using more immutable types would mean a lot more copying, which is slow. I'm not sure why Javascript programmers have suddenly decided they want to be more functional, but perhaps it's because their mutable types are so error-prone that immutability seems like a good way out.
This was posted other day apparently it's rankings based on search results. So all excel warriors pushing up the vb results. 
I wonder does anyone in the sub studies pythons with Python?

Ahh, thanks!
Neat idea! I've sometimes ended up with a makefile that's just copying things with scp so this looks pretty cool! One thought, I haven't looked into your implementation but you said you're doing an infinite loop watching the directory, it might be more efficient to use a library that reads the OS events when things change instead of constantly looping - something like https://github.com/gorakhargosh/watchdog
I try to continue my freshed started website I made with Django about programming, but trying to promote is so annoying. I just want to create content and fun stuff and don't spend my life trying to click bait on social network... &amp;#x200B; So it's kinda stuck, as I don't want to write stuff for nobody...
fuckin lol
&gt;You get something like C, it's low overhead makes it great for bare-metal development, things like embedded systems. It's got quite a high-barrier of entry if you're looking to create full applications, and it's no good as a scripting language, you'd need to recompile per-target for it to be of any shareable use. Python has a lot going for it, but it is far from the [speed and efficiency of C (or C++)](https://jaxenter.com/energy-efficient-programming-languages-137264.html). For a lot of tasks that is irrelevant of course, but the above sentence could be interpreted as if python is efficient/fast, but compared to a lot of other languages it is rather slow. It makes it easy to use libraries in C though - but that is another (albeit related) discussion IMO.
JavaScript's design is a trainwreck for a number of reasons so there are a lot more attempts to bolt on things that will stabilize software written in it. The relative popularity of things like immutable.js and typescript reflect the greater demand for tools to stabilize JavaScript code bases which are just not as much in demand in python.
TIOBE index is next to worthless. It's based on search results, and that's far from accurate. C/C++ is pretty hard to properly search for on Google. Languages with more unique names will rank higher on TIOBE even if they're less popular, as will ones with higher amounts of web-activity per person using them. Extending that logical example to the extreme: imagine a language that no one actually uses for anything, but it's EVERYWHERE on the internet. Even your grandma is posting stuff all over about it. It'll rank high on TIOBE even tho it's not used at all. This is why VB.NET ranks so high - an unusually active group of programmers who post a ton more on the 'net per person than users of other languages. &amp;#x200B; Additionally any language taught in schools will get artificially inflated by a ton of students constantly churning out web-results while not actually using the language (in a production-sense). This is why Stack Overflow's rankings are similarly worthless. It just shows which languages have the most questions asked, which is higher in languages taught to 'newbies' to the programming world.
Ah, I see how I was misleading there suggesting Python was perhaps suitable for embedded systems. You're quite right, the majority of code written in C or C++, sans anything particularly boneheaded, will always outperform Python. Simply doesn't have the overhead of the interpreter, the hand-holding in Python lends to speedy development and greater semantic faith in the code satisfying a spec. Then you've the overhead of garbage collection and the such. You're right to have pulled me up on the sloppy way I worded that comparison. I was aiming for two extremes of Scripting versus Application Development, and tying it back to the fact Python is popular because it *can* do both. I'd no sooner see C eschewed for Python in embedded systems than I would see Bash eschewed for Python when it came to generic server scripts (simply put, I can rely on a shell being there, not so much on Python - Nor the state of that Python instance). Merely pointing out, if you were a beginner, Python is able to offer you great insight and achievement in both of those worlds. Thanks for the clarification. Excellent link too! Power consumption is often an afterthought, especially when people think embedded systems without having been immersed in that scene. "Oh but memory is cheap and ARM is fast, we can run Python, might even compile it!" but power consumption soon shoots beyond reasonable means. If your solution to a language chosen over another involves discussing power densities of batteries, if you've not chosen C, you might have backed the wrong horse!
This is a green tree python and you can buy them from captive bred breeders quite easily. 
Green tree pythons are my favorite python. I own two boas, though. I’ve had two bosses try to introduce me to a crowd as the python person who owns snakes, but both fell flat because it’s kind of just a bad joke. 
There's so many libraries that run c underneath though, for scientific purposes it's what researchers want, they don't want to make rock solid maintainable code, they want to get things running as quick as possible. All the mathematical operations in things like tensorflow and scikit are going to be just as fast whether you write them in Python or c
A lot of people don't see the performance to be an issue. It really depends on your usage but modern computers have become so fast that performance is moot. Now, if you're processing records for a bank or insurance company speed might be a higher priority.

Can you give some high level examples of what would make your project end up needing to move to Django? Maybe some examples of what each framework is good at, but then why you'd want to move to the next, and then the next, etc? Thanks!
Fantastic! It's great to see the kids really grok the power they have when they code. From the triumph of creation, through to the triumph and frustration of debugging. You can instantly tell when they've grasped the creative realm they've just stumbled into. When we were learning BASIC with the frustrations and creativity that came out of that... Man, I can only imagine what kids these days are going to be dreaming up with the resource they have! It's exciting. I gave up on my career as a Dev many years ago after burning out in a rather spectacular fashion. I've since entered the wonderful realm of the SysAdmin (affords me plenty of time to code - Without client specs, gorgeous infrastructure, and ultimately solvable problems). Started out (career-wise) with Perl, later what is now Classic ASP (VBS), on to .NET (C#). Had my hand in PHP, Python, Ruby, and NodeJS projects but never really considered the latter 4 to be a core competency, or more, never what I was actually hired to do, just happened to be willing to do it. Nowadays I get to automate with Python. Enjoy tinkering with internal PHP applications. Write a lot of PoSH for Windows-specific automation (Gives me a chance to flex the .NET skills). I'd like to have done more with Python in a web context professionally. That being said, I've done plenty of personal projects using Django and the such. I'm sure if the itch becomes persistent there'll be an open-source project I could dive into. Lot of languages out there, each with their own favoured domain.

If it's homework that you're automating, then you're a kid. Get over it.
Rsync might be another option
It's not totally fine. It is literally the cause of the OP's problem. I know some people do it to keep the version easier to manage, but it will break as soon as the package depends on anything outside the standard library.
I made a similar tool a while ago to let me copy things quickly and save them somewhere. I decided to print to stdout instead of saving to a file because that is more flexible with gnu utils such as `tee`. https://github.com/FichteFoll/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/bin/follow_clip

I've dabbled a bit in a several different sysadmin/helpdesk/software development positions. I succeed at them all and usually end up moving into management. Currently I'm doing .NET development in [VB.NET](https://VB.NET) and C#. I do a lot of VB.NET for legacy applications and it's become my specialty though I really don't like [VB.NET](https://VB.NET). Starting the beginning of the year I will likely be in the management position that I've resisted taking for around 2 years now. I'd rather be coding but my manager is persistent. 
Ack, I've never been a fan of VB.NET, too verbose for my liking, and I genuinely like the statement terminators in C-like languages. I've been a Senior for the past 2 gigs, previously at a FinTech gig, adored that. Now at a large development house, pretty green here still, but ultimately finding it equally as enjoyable as the last place. Not sure I'm cut out for a full-time management position, Senior is about as far as I'm happy climbing. That being said, if I were using VB.NET daily, my opinion on that management position might swiftly change! All the best to you. Does your manager know you've a penchant for coding? I would suggest mentioning it, but I guess the risk there is taking a management title and piling a second workload atop. That'd likely end in tears all round. Thanks for the particularly wholesome thread! A fine Sunday it's been. Didn't expect to be chatting on the topic of getting younger folk into the joys of coding, I'm very glad we did though.
Yes, I've discussed my desired with my manager and my experiences in past management positions. She is already working towards dumping my current workload so I won't be doubling up. She says it's a big problem in our company and it leads to many of the people that have been promoted to leave the company which is lost talent. She's determined not to let that happen, though I will still have some coding to do.

ok,well I'd heard rumor Pyscripter was also availale as an 'online' or web IDE, also, but couldn't find it when I did a web search. Hope I just missed it when I searched, and that it is available somehwere. Thanks anyway
In industrial mathematics python is basically everything you need. MATLAB is very expensive, and python can do whatever matlab could. For everything else you can use NumPy, SciPy and SymPy. Plots with Matplotlib. The only reason to prefer MATLAB over python are their toolboxes measurements in embedded systems, in my opinion. Add to that all data science packages. Pandas, scikit learn, tensorflow and everything depending on it. It's all in python. There is an upcoming group of people using Julia, and I think that's going to be the main competitor against python in the next years. Industrial mathematicians do not want to think too much about efficiency, data structures and data types. NumPy just allows you to think in terms of tensors and matrix/vector operations. An implementation in any other language would require you to work with multi-dimensional arrays, which is a hell of a job. Python just does the job.
Even if there was a web version, I think you’d find it novel but not useful for actual development.
You can run a Linux desktop pretty easily with crouton. 
You mean run Wine on crouton ? (pyscripter is a Windows program)

I worked for a previous employer for most of a decade. I replaced their VB6 and Visual FoxPro code (and database!) with Python, PostgreSQL, and Linux/FreeBSD. After I left, they listened to an idiot CTO who scrapped the whole thing and re-wrote it again in VB.Net (in 2013!!!) and SQL Server because “it’s easier to hire for”. On one hand, it kind of stung to see something I’d tried to make nice be replaced with a pre-deprecated crapfest. On the other, LOL, have fun with that!
Here’s your lollipop! *pat pat*
Not only all the things you said, but list comprehensions!! :-)
Very true! A hugely important skill in almost all sects of development. My mentor way back when in my first job used to say "LISP dev, now that's *real* development!" and lament upon the fact he didn't pursue LISP. This was a C/C++ dev who knew more Asm than most had forgotten... So, safe to say, I was inducted into the world of coding firmly believing List comprehension is a big deal. 
Wow. That was the dumbest thing I've heard today. That CTO must really like VB. If they were to rewrite it they could at least have chosen C#. 
How can I be an industrial mathematician? My undergrad is in math, but I can’t really find relevant work.
You've always been able to use sqlalchemy with Django. You can just not use Django's ORM.
immutable.js is widely used in all sorts of JS projects. I'm most familiar with its usage in React projects. It seems a weird argument to make that it's getting downloaded but not used because of your anecdotal experience. I agree that it's annoying to use. 
You mean to say that i don't have to use math.ceil?
sure, you just lose Django admin, etc e.g. much of the reason you might want Django in the first place. (at least afaik)
Are you suggesting professional software engineers don't seek help in search engines and Stack Overflow, and it is just children posting in there? Yeah right.
Well, ``round`` rounds down also, so it's not quite the same: &gt;&gt;&gt; round(1499, -3) 1000
Neural networks are mostly linear algebra. If you're implementing neural nets, matlab would be a great tool for that.
If you need an immutable hashmap with arbitrary keys, you: pip install frozendict # or similar As you noted, these libraries *exist* in Python, they just see less use compared to Immutable.js. Of course, if you just need to be able to use a string to access the attribute, you can do this with a namedtuple: from collections import namedtuple from random import choice Coord = namedtuple("Coord", "x y z") point = Coord(2, 13, 5) axis = choice(["x", "y", "z"]) value = getattr(point, axis) print "axis %s: %s" % (axis, value) Or with a little more dynamism: def get_keys(nt): for key in dir(nt): if key[:1] != "_" and key not in ["count", "index"]: yield key for key in get_keys(point): value = getattr(point, key) print "%s: %s" % (key, value)
That exactly. &amp;#x200B; For instance, Microsoft does an absolutely TON of C++ and C# dev work, and I can absolutely promise they're, at most, 5% as likely to post on StackOverflow per hour of coding than some college kids learning for the first time. Not to mention that large enterprises have internal resources, nearby coworkers to simply ask instead, etc. Using something like SO or Google/Bing results to gauge how widely used a language is doesn't really work. It just shows what is most popular ON THE INTERNET and nothing more. A few vocal minorities can severely skew results.
Due to it's killer application Spark, Scala has also picked up a lot of steam. But since Spark has pyspark apis, learning scala is not that relevant.
I know, I just have to make sure I don't copy any passwords.

That is true, which is why you shouldn't do that. You can do just about anything wrong, but the import itself isn't an issue.
This post is better suited for r/learnpython 
Got tired of losing what i had copied. So i run it in the background most of the time. 
I agree that TIOBE is worthless, but for the opposite reason - it overstates **by far** the relevance of C and C++. No other ranking has these languages so high, and no job market I have ever seen (and I have researched quite a few, including on other continents) had more job openings in C/C++ than in JavaScript, let alone 7x times more.

But if that hypothesis is true, why is Java up there? I don't think Java is taught at school or even at University level - as far as I know.
It's effectively the language of choice in devops.
Agreed. The number of Django developers are dwindling and many lesser known libraries are unmaintained, when a few years ago Django was one of the most popular web frameworks. Now every job I can find that requires Python are DS jobs like you said.
I think that this list has to be correlated with academic questions. I'm neither a hater of VB.Net, nor a huge fan of it or OOP. To me, it's the same language as C#. My guess is that the search engine queries that were used to compile this list trends towards college students where VB.Net will be encountered more often than in the wild. Python is even going to be encountered more in college than in the wild. 
I'm currently comparing values from csv (lets call it x) to another csv(lets call it y) and it checks for updated values in x, and if there are new rows then it updates y. I'm simply going to add that while loop you used to make it a continuous process instead of running every night :)

Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
Those rankings have issues too, since it's based on job postings, not actual jobs. So stuff with high turnover (because it sucks) or hard to fill (because it sucks) will be disproportionately high (precisely why SQL is on top there). Doubly so if you're posting and reposting and reposting the same job trying to get it filled. Conversely, positions that are quick and easy to fill, because there's more programmers than positions, won't get posted as much as ones that are harder to fill. Even tho they're basically the same language, Java is a lot easier to fill than C# due to everyone and their uncle's dog getting taught it in college, so even if there's a lot mroe Java positions, if there's an excess of programmers in that language, there's not going to be a lot of postings. But really, the bottom line is just learn whatever language they use at the company you want to work for. At this point, after I don't know how many languages I know, learning a new one is 3 weeks, tops, to be proficient, and a few months to master. If I found out that Julia was the hot language at the place I'm wanting to work, then I'd spend a few weeks getting proficient in it before interviewing, and most interviewers realize that good programmers can switch to a new language without much trouble, since the language isn't the hard part, it's the concepts and paradigms and whatnot. Master those and the language is just a tool.
VS Code is better than Sublime. You should use PyCharm.
I suspect SQL's position is more due to it being required as a secondary skill in a lot of jobs that are primarily based on some other language, rather than job filling issues. Javascript's result is likely also inflated by the same effect, although to a lesser degree. Any ranking will obviously have issues, but no other ranking I have ever seen has such obvious ones as TIOBE. The one I linked to is the closest to the reality I have seen on the job market, hence my posting it. It's not perfect but hopefully it can save me from having to sigh at the sight of yet another poor young guy starting his "so I decided to learn programming" thread with something like "so I decided to start by learning C because TIOBE said it is sooo popular, it was also the fastest in the benchmarks I have seen, which is *of course* the most important thing, and some random neckbeards on the internet said I would *really* understand what true programming means thanks to learning it. But now that I'm actually looking for a job it turns out nobody is actually hiring C devs, especially not junior ones, while every recruiter in my area asks me if I know something called 'React'. Plz help, what am I doing wrong?" And sure, once you know a modern programming language, learning another one is quick, you don't have to teach me that.
&gt; At this point, after I don't know how many languages I know, learning a new one is 3 weeks, tops, to be proficient, and a few months to master Not C++ :)
What a great post. The PyPy developers have always amazed me with the level of commitment and dedication they have with taking on such a huge project. Good luck to them for another 15 years and consider donating [time or money](http://pypy.org/) to this great effort. They have a proven track record of delivering big results.
Just a heads up in case someone else wants to use it.
Well... not C++... but pretty much anything else that does't have the "let's add every possible feature" mantra that C++ has, sure.

&gt; I don't think Java is taught at school or even at University level Java is generally the language of choice to teach OOP, at least in the US. &gt;If you don't believe me, look at Github's report from last year based on Pull requests. Obviously python is going to have a ton of PR on github. The entire community revolves around open source. Anyway, we're talking about the credibility of using searches as a gauge of popularity. No one is arguing that python isn't a popular language. No one is even arguing that the TIOBE index is wrong. The other guy is saying that measuring by searches is misleading, because there are many other factors. For instance, Google probably has incredible internal resources for Go, so the largest user of the language is probably googling it the least often.
Immutability isn't about performance. Obviously modifying an object is faster than creating a whole new one. Often times, a language implements immutability for the user and uses mutable objects behind the scenes for performance (ie, react's virtual dom). Immutability is about making code easier to reason about.
Hmm, I'll definitely have to look into watchdog, I just hate adding dependencies (believe it or not this is my first time using PyPi to upload a package). I feel like it isn't that much work for the script since all it is doing is walking a directory and getting the last modified time. Before, I had a version that was hashing each file so it wasn't as efficient at all. Right now there is an `ignore` list that you can append to to ignore directories or files. That way it only walks the directories/files that are not ignored and moves really quick (it's virtually instant when it picks up the change and starts the upload). I'm willing to bet with larger projects (more files/folders that are not ignored) it might not be as instant, however I have not run into that issue yet. 
And then again, Sublime launches in &lt;1 sec, is always responsive, doesn’t use a ton of RAM, and with the right plugins can be every bit as good as VS Code. I’ve been using both for over a year, (sublime for many years) and yes VS Code has pros, but it certainly also has cons.
I looked into `rsync` before writing this script and I cannot remember why I decided to continue with my script tbh. Oh well, it's not like this project took very long to write. It's under 150 LOC. 
The speed can be enhanced without much fuss; there's the PyPy compiler, Nuitka, Numba, Cython + more
Node.js is probably the reason for less active Django development, not shifts in Python usage. I actually had to scroll down six or seven results before seeing the first DS description on Google Job Search, but overall, Python is +++ on growth in all areas as compared to a decade ago. The DS stuff is just additional expansion.
Facebook uses it as part of their projects which can contribute to increased download size without increasing direct usage by others. Similarly, left-pad was one of the most downloaded packages but many people had never even heard of it until its associated fiasco and so raw download count isn’t necessarily an accurate measurement of usage.
Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.... &gt; and you may not use any lists Fuck.
yeah that was my thoughts as well. If I could use strings then I would only need a little help but... I have no idea how to do this without strings
The huge boom in popularity (and capability) of machine learning has definitely played a significant role in Python's recent rise in popularity. How Python came to be used so widely for Machine Learning is something I don't know the answer to. Certainly it's ease of integration with C/native libraries for performance optimisation played a big part, as no doubt the ease with which it can be embedded into other applications (I personally first used Python as part of Blender). You could also look at the syntax, in-particular the way Python elegantly handles lists of data - something which many academics deal with all the time, could appeal. It would be interesting to read an account of how it came to be so popular in that field!
Just started using PyCharm. Any tips?
This is probably more appropriate to /r/learnpython As a hint, however, look at the built-in functions ord and chr.
Check out some tutorials - there are some pretty great code assist and debugging features in it.
Not hot dog.
Fun :-) Also, have a look at : - Colorising Black &amp; White Photos using Deep Learning - Super Resolution using Deep Learning I think you would like these ideas ;)
I think this is the root cause; see also aggressive lint configs that ship with tools like CreateReactApp.
Hi there, thank your for your reply and my apologies for replying so late. I'm going repeat some lessons on Code Academy, so I hopefully will be able to solve problems quicker then which is the case right now. Once again, truly sorry for the late reply but it is very appreciated!
Given the "no lists" constraint, you could create a dictionary `{'a': 1, 'b': 2, ...}` and then loop through the list storing the information you need. Alternatively you can convert characters to their [ASII value](http://www.asciitable.com/) so you don't need to write a dictionary by hand. In both solutions, be careful with case as `A` and `a` have different ASCII values For better performance, use a [sorted dictionary](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict) and start at character after the one provided. This is just a quick-glance solution so sorry if this doesn't help. Good luck!
That gives some hope! Your posts are very interesting and I loved reading through them. I'll try to not get so worked up about it but at the same time get frustated enough that I want to learn about it. Thank you for taking the time to reply, it really helped me out!
Hi there! Thank you for linking me to that subreddit. I didn't know of its existence before now. I'll be sure to check it out! Sorry for posting it in the wrong subreddit in this case :(
Apparently it already has the information stored with ASCII so "a" &gt; "b" is True so I dont need to convert to numbers since its already known. I just dont know how to write the code that checks all this
Ignoring it is pythonic? What? I'm as meh on 484 as the next guy but adding them doesn't make code unpythonic. Don't be Dr J Evans Python.

SQL is also a requirement for loads of jobs that aren't primarily programming based. You'll need it as a BI analyst, for example, but often won't require any particular scripting language. In big companies with expensive, enterprise level, BI and ETL tools, that require a lot of skill to properly configure and use, there are loads of jobs like this.

Compared to PyCharm, VS Code feels faster and easier to configure. Also, the Vim plugin had more functionality that I use regularly. It was so UCB easier to just start coding.

I don't think the stats you're listing mean the things you're inferring. 
im so sorry i cheated you! PlzZZ FOrgiVE MEEeeee
Yeah, I'm aware of that. My point is that you not seeing it that often is just an anecdote. A plausible explanation for high number of downloads while you seeing it rarely is just that, a plausible explanation. Plausibility is only very weakly correlated with accurate explanations.
This. The immediate reward I got from seeing my creation come to life in a browser allowed me to stick with programming. The things I create in python usually run on the command line, which just doesn't seem as cool in the beginning.
I doubt it, mostly because it isn't an upgrade. It's an implementation of the specification, just like CPython is an implementation. There are drawbacks and wins on both sides
Right?? In the beginning, it’s all about doing low-barrier stuff that gets you excited about programming and starts the feedback loop of successes that build on each other, and keeps you motivated and coming back for more.

I use pyrsistent all the time - I can't imagine programming without it. I wish there was equivalent of clojure's specter that worked on pyrsistent data structures. I've thought about writing it, but I simply don't have the time :(
I can’t wait for the day that we can get accurate type inference so that I don’t have to statically type before compiling
Sadly, no 8-bit microcontroller can handle python. If you want to be able to use full python, you'll have to upgrade to a full SOC like raspberry Pi or beaglebone. If you want to stick to something relatively low-power like Arduino, you're best bet would be one of the adafruit circuitpython boards https://www.adafruit.com/circuitpython Keep in mind though: circuitpython / micropython is a subset of python. It only supports some of the syntax you're used to. What this means is that although you will probably be able to write micropython programs with ease, you probably can't expect almost any python packages to work out of the box on the micropython / circuitpython platform
That’s fair.
Interesting, can you expand a bit?
I am creating a script that downloads a YouTube video's captions, extracts topics/entities from them, and then outputs a list of timed-stamped topics, so that you can go to the part of the video where they are mentioned.

I'm going to take a swing here. A wild swing. Let me know if anything about my thought process is totally out of whack. I *suspect* that at some point in your code, you are trying to index into a list. I further suspect that that index is greater than or equal to the length of the list. This is, after all, *exactly what the error message says*. The way to resolve this is to look at where you're creating lists, and where you're indexing those lists. Make sure the lists are longer than the indexes. Print a bunch of values if you need to. Write assert statements if you need to. Just please, demonstrate that you've made *some* effort to debug this yourself. Also, /r/learnpython, and don't share code with images because it prevents other people copying and pasting to test it themselves.
When you index a string, you get a single character. `n, m = int(line[0]), int(line[1])` sets n to 8 and m to 5. Is that what you're trying to do, or are you trying to extract the whole 85?
I honestly believe it's web. The path will also force you to learn some javascript which is always a good thing but take it easily, don't try to chug both languages at the same time. Focus on your python and do just enough js as you need, if you need it. I'm on the same journey you're embarking on and I've always looked at it this way: To get a job as a dev I need: 1. A portfolio 2. Open source contributions 1) A portfolio is your proof of work. You show you are capable of building a functional website that is capable of running some logic in the background, interact with users, display information, whatever. 2) Open source contributions demonstrate that you can dive into a codebase. You have read a bunch of code written by other people, understood the logic behind it, then helped by adding your own logic. You also engage in activities like discussing issues, code, ideas, what not and will become familiar with git or version control in general, which is also a massive plus
[Pybind11 likely saved the Python core devs from releasing Python 3.6 with a showstopper bug](https://bugs.python.org/issue28147#msg283246) (severe dict performance regression) that they hadn't noticed but that pybind11's test suite triggered. Given how important 3.6 was for solidifying the transition to 3.x it's hard to overstate how important this was for the health of the Python ecosystem. 
There is a tool called rsync (available in GitHub). It listens to changed files in a directory, scps them, and if there are too many - calls rsync. It works quite well. My one problem with it is that it's mostly written in perl (the listening logic is in IIRC).
Cool, how do you send the email in Python? If you use an email service (like gmail), could you link a code snippet to do this? I would like to write some scripts that send me an email too...
I believe that the reason for this is that JS is moving towards functional styled frameworks, such as React and Vue. I have personally used React in a functional way (basically almost never using state) and it is gorgeous. Python is stateful by nature and by idiom. It is intrinsically object oriented. It would be very messy to mix immutable data structures when everything, from everyone else is based on internal state change and side effects. So I can't see many benefits.
You might consider https://www.pythonanywhere.com, they have a decent free tier.
Well, with 3.7 you can use the `dataclass` annotation for most use cases. In my opinion, it’s actually more convenient compared to the `attrs` method.
Are you talking about basic the programming language ? Or you mean the basics of python ? No body needs to learn basic in this day and age. For the basics of python, it depends on what is your goal of learning, some tasks are simple, other are difficult so it depends on a lot of things including your own commitment. There is another subreddit r/learnpython dedicated to beginners, you will find friendlier crowd there

Just a probably stupid question: Does comparing 3D points make any sense? How do you determine if a point "has a higher value" than other? You can probably have multiple methods for ordering them. For example, if you have (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), what's their order and what does it mean? Even though that's not the point of the post, I think the author could have picked a better example.
lol no thread parallelism
dataclass is just subset of what attr does. Additionally attr works with older Python versions too. I sometimes use attr, and doubt I will use dataclass except in far future where all machines I care about have Python 3.7 provided by the OS :)
The big problem is still that there is no specification of Python, only a canonical implementation.
It's also the fact that companies like Instagram, Dropbox and YouTube built their whole (almost) infrastructure on it. Also, read this excerpt from a book https://books.google.com/books?id=eulODwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA136&amp;dq=google%20video%20vs%20youtube%20python%20story&amp;pg=PA136#v=onepage&amp;q=google%20video%20vs%20youtube%20python%20story&amp;f=false 
Well there's a [grammer spec](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/grammar.html) and [lang ref](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/), which more or less if followed completely is a spec
It makes sense in terms of magnitude, as in, distance of point from origin. But thr author isn't comparing that way, so yeah horrible example.
My fail now. 🤣🤣

Even namedtuples are a nice simple transformation for rows -&gt; data holders (or vice versa) and there's no libs that use that AFAIK. Of course, writing basic ones yourself isn't too bad, e.g. something like `[MyTuple(*row) for row in c.execute(select_stmt)]` in the case of namedtuples. Of course, if you have some good ideas...no one is stopping you from working on a nice lib for it :). I'd probably use it.
&gt;And this doesn’t even mention the fact that science has proven that [you shouldn’t use inheritance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MNVP9-hglc). Ah, two people gave a talk somewhere and now science knows inheritance is bad. I can see the benefit of attrs, but jesus, that talk is hardly a reason not to just inherit from a namedtuple, and it really isn't that hard to just write a `__repr__`. 
Our App can connect Woocommerce
AFAICT there’s nothing more convenient about DCs except that you don’t have to install them. It seems like attrs’ use of type annotations still isn’t widely known so I’m gonna use this opportunity to advertize for it: http://www.attrs.org/en/stable/types.html
In respect to Django, maybe you could write some magic dataclass class decorator that takes a dataclass and turns it into a django model. As long as it returns the right model, I believe it should just work and django wouldn't be any wiser.
I'm using `attrs` with Python 3.7 (for that class variable type annotation goodness). I highly recommend it. It enables a style of programming where data and behaviour is decoupled - similar to how it might be done in old-school imperative code - that in my opinion avoids most of the pitfalls of traditional object-oriented programming.
I don't think there is direct support for this; I would suggest plotting the markers as individual "images" (see [https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/gallery/lines\_bars\_and\_markers/gradient\_bar.html](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/gradient_bar.html#sphx-glr-gallery-lines-bars-and-markers-gradient-bar-py) for an example).
That's true of many interpreted languages though - Perl would be the obvious well-established candidate that was very strong until just after the turn of the millennium where it started to lose ground. The obvious modern competitor language is JavaScript, but I hadn't realised that Python predates it by some 5 years, which is a very significant period of time in Computer Science. Python wasn't on my radar until some 9-10 years after its release. I wonder if Python's meaningful whitespace played a part? I was a professional Perl developer for a couple of years and I really didn't like it (I even said so in my interview!). Not because of how I used it, but because of just how messy you could be with it.. which invariably idiots thinking they were being clever would do. If I'd known about Python at that time, it would have been a breath of fresh air!
I'm thinking about implementing a data pipeline that backed my Instagram bot. I'm make some experiments with Luigi and Airflow, but they are a bit too complexes for my goals. Any suggestions?
I made somethign similar for my soccer stats scraper, but it's not so mature. Is it compatible with BS? It will be a good plus :)

I recently heard about pybind11 and it looks like just what I need :) I want to create python bindings for a small part of the [VCG library](https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/vcglib/). I have two questions: * How does pybind11 behave with a header-only library? It shouldn't be a problem, because pybind11 is itself a header-only lib right? * How would pybind11 handle the heavy use of templates in vcg?

Incidentally I do "for i in range(len(myArray))" a lot, what is the most pythonic alternative?
You will probably get more help in r/learnpython. Just a friendly suggestion 
&gt; it seems its performance when it comes to C/C++ bindings is also better: https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/issues/1227 Not undermining Cython perfomances, neither PyBind11, but a Micro-benchmark on a adding function is not really a meaningful use case :/ 
Ok thanks!
if you're only using i to access the current item: for item in my_array: do_stuff(item) If you for some reason you need the numeric value of i use enumerate: for i, item in enumerate(my_array): is_odd = i % 2 == 1 do_stuff(item, odd=is_odd)
The problem with the `[paths]` section is that the tests get run on random gitlab CI runners (different OSes) and each runner executes them in a random directory and I somehow have to merge them in the end.
Check ipv4 vs ipv6. [docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org) offers connectivity on both, while most other sites you test with probably don't. docs.python.org is an alias for dualstack.python.map.fastly.net. dualstack.python.map.fastly.net has address 151.101.16.223 dualstack.python.map.fastly.net has IPv6 address 2a04:4e42:4::223 You can test with `curl` by forcing it to use ipv4: `curl -4 -v https://docs.python.org`.
Why are you relying on the OS version of Python? I can’t think of when you’d ever do that, eg in web dev or data processing, you should install your own copy of Python. 
 def get_name(output): for item in output: If ‘NAME’ in item: return item[‘NAME’] 
If you want both/all values into a list: [x['Value'] for x in output if x['Key'].upper() == 'NAME'] *output* being your list. If you want the value for a single key use: if x['Key'] == 'NAME' # or if x['Key'] == 'Name'
Attrs does really nasty tricks in __init__ that break all kinds of reflection techniques. Mypy has a lot of trouble with attrs, so do linters and other things. I mean, I still use it, but there are definitely things dataclasses are better about.
Thank you.
Thanks.
How do you represent foreign keys, int/float sizes, primary keys, multi-column check constraints, uniqueness constraints, indices, etc with just data classes? I suspect the reason no ORMs use namedtuples and won't use data classes is that they need more information than those mechanisms provide.
PyBind11 is excellent! I have had lots of success with it in speeding some calculations.

As far as I know you'll have to do configure that in OS X, either by disabling ipv6 or by making the name resolution prefer ipv4 if available. 
Hi! I'm 25 and completely self taught! I starting coding because I was fascinated by fractals and Python gave me a way to explore them. Over time, my abilities grew and now I code in Python for a living. My recommendation to a new programer is to first find something interesting you can use Python to learn more about, and second to choose to challenge yourself with projects that are perhaps "too difficult" right now. As long as you stay passionate and keep pushing, you'll improve. Also, read stackoverflow when in doubt. My only regret in my programming past is staying too niche too long. You being on here means you're already off to a stronger start than I. Good luck! 
I generally think `attrs` usage should be almost always used. It has some annoying things, like making it frozen means you can't do a post init initialisation, and it's syntax takes a little getting used to, but it's definitely very full featured and really results in much nicer classes (when you do write them). FWIW, I've stopped using namedtuples and just use frozen attrs since the syntax is so much nicer. dataclasses have nicer syntax but are significantly more limited and being able to run python3.7 is not a luxury I have at work. 
Looks like I'm going to have to use VSCode. 
If you are used to Linux go for the Linux subsystem. Works well for me when I'm occasionally need to code on my gaming rig. You can embed bash directly into terminal in vscode as well
The thing is that vscode can't read the environment from WSL and this breaks code navigation and Intellisense.
ah, true, I'll try that, thanks :)
I like [this guy](https://pythonprogramming.net)
Hi, Good luck getting started. Please check out /r/learnpython where you will find a place to post questions on learning python.
Is this a free platform?
I think there's a way to pay for extra, but the free stuff is more than enough to get started with.
If, say, one in two classes were like the Point3D example this would make some sort of sense. In practice I can't even remember the last time I wrote a class like that. The amount of boilerplate it would save me from writing would not be worth the headache of the added magic.
You can also install Python 2 along side Python 3 in Windows is minimal hassle - you'll have to set paths and such. Also, Pyenv works with the command prompt (cmd.exe) or Powershell. Just remember when you're installing Python on Windows, on the installer, check the ["Add Python to Path"](https://docs.python.org/3/_images/win_installer.png) check box. &amp;#x200B;
 hank you for your help and encouragement!! You always know how to make life brighter for everyone you know! 
Having a project to work on is a tip I can back. If you have a goal to work towards you can get a real practical idea of how well you are progressing. And nothing feels better than knocking a hard snippet of code that you have been struggling on for days out of the park. &amp;#x200B; My first project has been an ASCII version of Conways Game of life in python. Just today I got the last of the base functionality completed. Feels good.
Hello and thank you!! 
Comparing doesn't have to have any semantics. It is useful in and of itself for containers which have properties based on ability to establish order of their elements. In other words, things you can compare, you can put into priority queue, heap etc.
If you use vs code you can access the terminal directly with vscode and operate as you would a Unix machine
I know about the terminal. My main question is there is a way to integrate the virtualenv created into WSL with VSCode for intellisense and code navigation. This is what stops me from using Windows now. Or maybe there is another code editor/IDE that can do this, read virtualenvs from WSL?
I would question what use ordering is in these instances. If order is important then it is important for a reason, and how that order manifests itself is intrinsically tied to that reason. Having an arbitrary comparison just so things can be put into arbitrary order is just as useful as iterating through them randomly.
Some devs coming from c/c++ background would prefer writing it in c/c++ rather than learning a new paradigm. yes cython looks easy and pythonic but some still want it to look like the old ways.
Have you tried to use a docker container? I did it to developer in a windows machine. 
Regarding the post init initialization, you can define a method called__attrs_post_init__ to do this. From the documentation “If a __attrs_post_init__ method exists on the class, it will be called after the class is fully initialized.” 
But not if it's frozen. You have to do all the post init in the validators of the class attributes. If one value depends on two inputs, you're out of luck.
I have build a large corporate website using windows 10, python and Django. Went very well. I used virtualenv and pycharm &amp;#x200B;
Game of Life is a project that I'd recommend to all new Python coders who think Game of Life is even vaguely cool. It teaches a lot. You can do it many different ways (printing the board, using OpenGL to render the board, etc). Plus playing with the rules of life after the whole thing is working is always fun. Excellent choice! But OP, I would recommend a smaller starting project first. Maybe something like random password generation or experimenting with sorting algorithms. Getting to know some data types now will help you a lot in the short term. 
Plenty of reasons. Main one is having it be automatically upgraded if and when there are security issues makes life easier. 
Agreed. While the definition of equality can be implicit (the objects are equal if all their fields are equal), comparison should be explicit. At the very least, the fields should be annotated to define the order of comparison...
For sure it was a challenge to get game of life to run as is. I still need to add a lot of features to it yet too. The core function of replication and death of cells and a way to convey that information is present now though. And moving into a gui based system is definitely on my to-do list with it. &amp;#x200B; But I had a blast learning new parts of python that I hadn't encountered before while doing it, and using objects and classes. &amp;#x200B;

In my recent experience of trying to get a new job, web + cloud (Flask/Django + AWS) are all the rage. I interviewed a couple of data science related positions, the bar is really freaking high (all my interviewers are PhDs). Data engineering is somewhat in the middle, most companies want Hadoop/Kafka. Web/Cloud path is probably easiest to get in assuming you don't have high TC (200K-300K) requirement.
Djalchemy eases the integration. You should check it. 
I think the point is not move to django, but start with django. You can write a simple [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) project with user registrations, sending mail, profile, sitemaps, an staff admin to perform tasks (moderation, load data,...),... in the time you evaluate which add-ons to use with pyramid. Then is possible to move to Pyramid because you want avoid monolithic architecture and separate things to hand-crafted microservices.
I am using and working on an ODM - not a relational but a document mapper. Currently it is using mongodb - as i need strong GIS capabilities, i might possibly add support for postgres (via hstore) in the future as well. It might very well benefit from adding dataclass support. I'm investigating into that. One thing that is required, though, is jsonschema compatibility (which i use for frontend and backend validation schemes and form generation) Check it out, if you're interested: https://github.com/hackerfleet/warmongo
I do a lot of python development in Windows. Virtual environments definitely work on Windows, it comes installed by default with the msi installers. As others have mentioned, when installing be sure the "Add Python to PATH" is checked (I believe that's default now, but double check). VSCode, PyCharm, Wingware? and a few other Python IDE's have built in support to manage envs, and you can manqge them from the command line as well. I usually use Git BASH when messing with venvs directly, but CMD/powershell works as well.

&gt; Creating python bindings to C/C++ code is one of Cython's many features. So I'm wondering why would I want to use pybind11 when Cython can do it all and a lot more. I switched from Cython to pybind11 because Cython simply couldn't handle my use-case. But I quickly realized that pybind11 is also *a lot* easier to use than Cython, for making bindings. I think Cython is great because it allows you to move your slow python code almost as-is to Cython, and have it compiled to something faster. But for bindings, it simply can't compete with pybind11 (or at least couldn't a year ago). 
Awesome. Thanks 
&gt;Python already struggles with performance as it is. AFAIK performance is not the primary target of CPython otherwise you would not use it (and use chez scheme or GNU Guile instead). &gt; Using more immutable types would mean a lot more copying, which is slow. Immutable datastructre don't rely on deep copy. It's Copy-On-Write with structural sharing. &gt; it's because their mutable types are so error-prone That's true; but it's not **only** a problem with error-prone datastructures (like misleading method names) but more generally error handling aka. exception support is poor compared to Python. See the backtrace of async/await compare that with asyncio... Like other have said; immutability is something that helps readability and build algorithm that rely less on global states to be mutated. Again like other have said, it is much easier to reason about your program doesn't mutate all-the-things and are pure.
In fact, most likely immutability will slow down your code. But you can sleep well at night knowing the dictionaries passed five functions down the call stack is going to remain untouched :)
Here is an example of code I coded yesterday that rely on \[immutables\]([https://github.com/MagicStack/immutables](https://github.com/MagicStack/immutables)). In this case, the use of an immutable datastructure avoids a deep copy. &amp;#x200B; r/https://github.com/amirouche/socialite/blob/fd1f62fd35b9828734e9ee8a12fc6e3d4633a9bd/src/socialite/sparky.py#L89
Also consider \`binder\`, which autogenerates pybind11 bindings for your project.
Saltstack can do this, among many other things. 
&gt;AFAIK performance is not the primary target of CPython But that doesn't make it irrelevant. Python is in a middle ground of being multi-paradigm, relatively user-friendly, but still usable for tasks that require some degree of performance, especially if you can throw numpy and friends into the mix. &amp;#x200B; &gt; otherwise you would not use it (and use chez scheme or GNU Guile instead) No, most people would use C++, Java, or C# instead. I think you're comparing to a hypothetical world where people are somehow using Python instead of functional languages, which is not one I recognise. &amp;#x200B; &gt; Immutable datastructre don't rely on deep copy. It's Copy-On-Write with structural sharing. Of course, but using that effectively usually requires language support, which Python doesn't easily offer. You can code custom containers that work the way you want but any interop with existing code or structures is going to do a lot of copying. &amp;#x200B; &gt; it is much easier to reason about your program doesn't mutate all-the-things and are pure The problem is that "reasoning about" and "understanding" are 2 different things. For simpler applications, nobody is interested in reasoning about it, they just want it to make sense, and for that, an imperative approach is much clearer. Not everyone leaves school understanding what a function is, but pretty much everyone leaves school knowing how to perform a list of instructions or to follow a recipe. &amp;#x200B;

If your stack has to be certified, or meet a strict uptime guarantee so has contracted support, you might not want to install your own version - assuming you even can. Then there's platforms like Google App Engine.
Certification can include the organisation, and your stack, as well as the software itself. If you pay an org like redhat, use their stuff verbatim, and call their techs, they can make much of that hassle go away.
CRA's lint config is actually _not_ aggressive - it's only focused on common mistakes that cause bugs, like using undefined variables. The Airbnb config, on the other hand, _is_ very aggressive, as it flags many common usage patterns as errors.

&gt; Creating python bindings to C/C++ code is one of Cython's many features. Creating C++ bindings with Cython is certainly doable, but can require a whole lot of boilerplate. That's not to say there's no boilerplate with pybind11, but it is (to me) much more straightforward. &gt; Cython has better tools support (supports even VS2008) I'm assuming by "tools support" here you mean compilers since you specifically call out VS 2008. In my experience, other tools such as linters, syntax highlighting, etc. are surprisingly lacking for Cython in a lot of editors/IDEs.
What is this mybridge.co thing? I've seen it in a few places now. Are they effectively trying to cut-out the middle-man and have articles automatically generated and posted on social media? It looks to be based on repo analysis, is that right? Not saying it's bad.. but I'm not sure it fits here.
That's not a good approach to equality. The problem with it: it may not terminate. So, sometimes you cannot have equality, but you can have ordering. And that's OK.
Yeah, it's basically just a crappy spam script that spits out lists of upvoted medium articles every month and people always upvote it for some reason. And I'm saying this as someone who has had many of my articles included in their lists.
The sidebar.
Anyone can put anything they want into python functions - it's not necessarily just valid or None. We're all consenting adults, you need some trust that people will use it properly. *However*, that means that you need to make it as easy as possible for people to know how to use it properly. For example, adding type annotations, giving comprehensive docstrings, and raising explicit errors for any edge cases you can think of where a user might expect something to work but it won't.
Thank you all for your responses, this was really helpful.
https://github.com/Deepwalker/aldjemy is another good choice
I mean, the articles it links to are generally good.. which is why this seems to sit in a weird place for me. I think I just don't like aggregate content being posted here, as you can't really have a discussion about 10 different articles (or projects, or whatever). Just seems weird. It's not like a f'Top {n} best {media_type} ever!' type post, which I think is 'OK' on reddit as we can unite in disagreement over the contents of the list. Maybe I'll write a bot that parses their site and submits the articles individually directly to the sub before it posts these! :P
Not a good approach for the general case, but it is a good approach for data classes. Also - ordering could also not terminate...
It depends a lot on your design style. I strongly prefer the style where I mostly have passive data with few nontrivial accessors (for which I need dataclasses/attr), functions that process it, and very few places that actually have an opinion on what should be done and glue everything together. This produces code that's much easier to understand, debug, extend, modify, and reuse. This is opposed to the OOP approach where lots of objects talk to other objects that they don't own and use increasingly convoluted methods to discover objects to talk to, getting parametrised with them, receiving them from base classes, from derived classes, receiving them as callbacks, receiving them _from_ callbacks, using IoC frameworks, and whatnot. Perversely, things get even worse than that, with more incomprehensible spaghetti as a result of people trying to make such code more customisable and reusable, which of course means _more_ indirection. Note that the approach I advocate is not the same as functional programming, because while I prefer immutable data where it makes sense I'm not religious about it, while many if not most FP people looove their higher order functions which create exactly the same mess. 
Nice slides. Definitely going to look at pybind. We use swig currently but mainly to wrap auto-generated code e.g protobuf or ASN 1. Quick question on a minor detail in the slide deck... Slide 42 on rolling stats, when function is run, first calculation with I==0, doesn't s(0) try to evaluate 0/0? What happens? Untrapped exception? Stdev = nan or 0/0 ==1 if my memory of university from 30 years ago.
Yeah, for instance dataclasses don't allow automatic `__slots__` and apparently no plans to add that. 
Great!
Yeah, sorry I meant aldjemy :) 
So is it worth learning django nowadays for web development? I heared that its really a strong framework and i have started learning python for about 2 weeks ago and planning to learn django as well. But after reading comments here, i actually doubt it. Should i learn it or instead focus on DS?

thank you fiskfisk ! ... I used SUDO NANO as indicated by [https://www.imore.com/how-edit-your-macs-hosts-file-and-why-you-would-want](https://www.imore.com/how-edit-your-macs-hosts-file-and-why-you-would-want) ... and it worked like a beauty. You saved me!
Just learn it. IMO Django is far superior to Nodejs/expressjs because 1. Django works at a higher level, so you can avoid a lot of boilerplate and be more productive, 2. writing Python code is so much easier than JS code.
Hahaha maybe it is ;) *dun dun dunnn* (it's not)
5 upvotes and 0 replies.. hmm..
Thanks. I'll check those out.
But we are given that ordering is *already defined*, it is not your imaginary ordering (which many not be defined). The problem isn't with equality in general, it is with your imaginary one: it doesn't necessary terminate, and the cases when it doesn't are really common: `defaultdict` is a practical and a common example.
You may want to rephrase the first statement / question. I don't really know what you are trying to ask / state.
Pybind11 doesn’t require you restate the types you want to use, just write register the functions or methods themselves. 
1. I want an offline "get similar-sounding tracks" python package, not an API proxy to your hidden machinery behind the curtain, are you planning to release that under a free license someday? 2. I understand this is rather my problem, but I find the "Why would you like an API key?" question humiliating and this is enough to shun me away from requesting one.
Alright, thank you for sharing your opinion! Ill start learning django after learning basic rules and syntax of python. Thanks again!
But if the order doesn't have extrinsic meaning, then you could use a set or a counter to do all of those things faster.

Set requires hashing, which may not be defined / will be defined equally arbitrary for these items. Sets don't always provide fastest access time. Sets cannot have repeated elements. Sets don't support indexed access (so you can only test containment, but you cannot extract elements in constant time). --- Bottom line: sets are non-solution, non-starter actually.

And yet - `defaultdict` has `__eq__` defined. So you are saying this should be defined: defaultdict(lambda: 1, a=1) == defaultdict(lambda: 2, a=1) But this shouldn't: @attr.s class Foo(object): d = attr.ib() Foo(d=defaultdict(lambda: 1, a=1)) == Foo(d=defaultdict(lambda: 2, a=1))

&gt; Using more immutable types would mean a lot more copying, No. You just reference it and overwrite the setter method. Immutable just means you can't change it, not that you need a unique copy for each. Now if you wrote it in C++, you could speed up your code because you don't need to do handle every case. That's one reason why numpy is fast. A disadvantage is you have to preallocate your arrays (or just just a list until the point you cast the data, which is slow).

I maintain a virtualenv in both WSL (venv) and Windows (venv_win). I run everything from WSL, and just maintain Windows virtualenv for intellisense/etc. Get everything setup from WSL virtualenv, pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt, then pip install -r requirements.txt from Windows virtualenv. It's a couple extra steps but makes working out of VScode on Windows much better.
Honestly, I haven't used Hugo so I can only say so much. They're both static site generators, so you will largely be able to do similar things with both. In deciding, you'll want to compare things like, available post languages (similar in both cases), templating languages (Nikola: Mako / Jinja2; Hugo: Go templates), engine language (Nikola: Python; Hugo: Go); base template (Nikola: extensive; Hugo: ?); community templates (Nikola: good; Hugo: extensive). For me, I wanted something written in Python so that I could hack on the engine if it gave me trouble. I wanted Mako templates because I like Mako. I wanted to write my own template so it was more important to have a strong base template to build on instead of community templates to adapt. Personally, I've contributed some code back to Nikola; it has a great, Python-esque community with a helpful email list. Writing templates is easy and the system is quite flexible for blog non-blog sites.
Good question. There are like 5 competing versions of Toontown.
No problem. Reddi'ts code formatting is f'ed up somehow. Beware of the extra `\` .
`print(round(1/7, int(input("How many digits of precision?"))))` You get use input from the input() function, cast it into an int, and then use that in the round() function to round to that many digits. Then the result of round() is printed.
Ok fair enough then
making the job easier, there's no need of using string notation

That sounds like a cool project; kudos for adding tech to the classroom. KhanAcademy's API docs look super old, but they might still work. I found this [Python wrapper](https://github.com/learningequality/khan-api-python) which might help you make requests. Last update was 2015, but the API routes seem to be the same. You'll need to request an [API key](https://www.khanacademy.org/api-apps/register) and use that in your secrets.py file. (See the README in the wrapper). I don't have time to confirm that this works right now, but let me know if it works. 
You can use bs to process the returned response
PyCharm is and IDE with alot of good plugins from JetBrains Pip is a packagemanager in Python Virtualenv is an isolated environment containing files, packages and runtime files for your project
There's a blast from the past, I remember beta testing that game.
&gt;Immutable just means you can't change it, not that you need a unique copy for each. You're thinking of call by value. No, I'm not. I'm thinking about when other mutable structures need the underlying data, and will therefore need to copy it out. You can see this in many languages where strings are immutable but when you actually want to do some work with them, there's copying everywhere and things slow down a lot.
It's not pyscripter but maybe you were thinking of https://www.pythonanywhere.com/ Anyway take a deep breath and use PyCharm on linux. Once you get used to it you won't look back.

You misuse the word "defined" here. When I say "defined", I mean that for every input we know what the output will be, I don't mean there's some code written to attempt to do something with the input (code may not define all outputs for all inputs). On top of that, I was reflecting on *your attempt at defining equality*, not on what exists in `defaultdict`. You can trivially define equality for any object without regard to its internal structure, to, for example, always be true (that's in logic known as "trivial system"). But, this is not how you defined it. *Your definition* had an obvious problem, viz. it assumed that objects must have finite number of fields, whereas there is no such requirement in reality.
Is anyone creating multiple executables? They don't end up in the same directory and they all have the same name. I have created a GitHub issue https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/3663

I wanted to work on something where as I can directly scrape all the data from either of the one. Can it happen?
Why did you decide to convince the owner otherwise if you don't even have data to support that position? Ultimately, the only thing that matters here is your existing and potential user base. If your clients are people who are locked into legacy systems then that's one thing. If you don't have that data, then consider how the large packages like numpy are handling the transition. Because they have a much more difficult time breaking backwards compatibility, their road plans for moving to Python 3 can inform you of when the broader python community thinks that supporting python 2 to is no longer worth the hassle.

Lemme know if you learn more or get it to work. I'm interested in what you end up using it for or if you used any of the demos. 
I’m practicing log parsing! (Prepping for interviews—wish me luck!)
PyCharm is the best option for static analysis (i.e. highlighting potential errors), and has a solid integrated debugger. Also, /r/learnpython will help you with your code if you post it there.
quality post. /s
If I understand you correctly, I just had to solve a similar problem to this myself. I ended up doing this with for loops, but then found out later that pandas does have a better way of dealing with this. This stack overflow question explains it, with additional information on cleaning the data that may or may not be relevant for you: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41457322/pandas-rearranging-a-data-frame
I know right
Unfortunately not. The multi-indexing needs constant levels of hierarchy and doesn't lend itself to disk-tree like hierarchies. (From what I have read in its docs and examples). 
I released the first public version of the Catalogue of Lepidoptera of Belgium: [http://projects.biodiversity.be/lepidoptera/](http://projects.biodiversity.be/lepidoptera/) Django's amazing for such projects where there are a few trusted editors and very little time/money for implementation, because Django's admin site make wonders.
Do you always leave your Visa sitting on your desk when you take photos of your monitor?
If you need hierarchy, consider using the ZODB. How big is your data set?
I took a look, but can't see how it would help. I will update my question to make things clearer. Thanks.
I am NOT clicking on that url, especially while at work. ^^Hint: ^^What ^^can ^^CP ^^stand ^^for?
A DB? how can it help display and calculate the data? I can see how it could be hacked - maybe store all possible paths as strings and do calculations on a regexp match on the strings; but I was hoping for info on a hierarchy aware tool. Thanks.
I second this. If you have a .edu email(which you can buy I think on the internet) you can get all of the other IDE’s for free from the website. I believe you can get the professional one with it. Not sure. 
Check out their documentation. Specifically [What PyInstaller Does and How It Does It](https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operating-mode.html). A quick summary that you should take with a grain of salt since I'm not a pro in this area: In single-file mode, which is what I use, it grabs all of your project's Python files, dependencies, and the current Python interpreter then packs that into a single executable whose entry point is their bootstraper. When executed their bootstrapper unpacks all of the bundled files into a temporary directory that it creates at run-time, then spins up the Python interpreter to execute your script.
PyInstaller has been a godsend for some of my projects at work. All of the Linux servers are stuck with Python 3.5, which isn't terrible but it causes some complications, and sometimes that's not even available. It also makes distribution of the project much easier as I can simply `rsync` a single file. **And** it makes all of this transparent to the end user. Due to some inconsistencies in some of our server environments I would've had to write a shell script wrapper to track down the user's local Python 3.5 interpreter and act as a simple single file entry point.
PyCharm has excellent debugger. It is without any doubts the best python IDE. If you want something more light-weight I suppose vs-code with python plugins installed is a good choice. There is a nice debugger out-of-box as well.
We Instagram now
Your second question, to me, suggests you’re ready to write unit tests and have smaller functions. 
Nice, a brand new Django tutorial, make Flask next please, I'm still deciding which one to learn but I think I prefer Flask more because of the simplicity
Thanks for your interest. What I have is equivalent to a list of data at various nodes in the hierarchy (mainly leaf nodes), and want to know if there are easy ways yo extract hierarchical stats (and maybe graphs). Pandas does a lot for arrays and series; I was wondering if there was similar for my kind of varying hierarchical data. 
Lakad Matataaag! Normalin, Normalin.
PyCharm all the way. Both its static analysis and its debugger are by far the best
EASIEST MONEY OF MY LIFE!
Really nice! I had done something similar using an old php CMS and have been procrastinating converting to Django but your site has renewed my enthusiasm! Is there any chance you could share the source? Really no worries if you cannot but thought I would ask.
My point was that CP also stands for Child Pornography ;)
I'm guessing your compiled binary isn't linking against `libpython.so` dynamically as it should. The `ldd` command on your resulting binary (`ldd pytest`) would be able to tell you as much. Instead of including `libpython3.5m-pic.a` as a compilation unit, try compiling with `-lpython3.5` instead.
It seems PyCharm is the favorite, however its not free right. I installed it, and it gave me a popup saying i have 30 days free trial.
Thanks for sharing this. 
I believe there is a community and a professional version. The first is free, but without all the features. I had the community for a whole and I never felt like it was lacking. 
Thanks for this answer. I hadn't considered that maybe a recursive solution would be both simpler to express and slower to run than an iterative solution. In that case, it's like Python itself, definitely a tool worth knowing.
Have you had a look at wxPython? [https://wiki.wxpython.org/wxPython](https://wiki.wxpython.org/wxPython)
Yes. Read my comments below 
Sublime-jedi or LSP
I love VS Code and it's integrated debugger and terminal. Check it out. 
Pycharm community is free! 
I have a couple more series of Django planned. But after that maybe but can't promise you anything.
:)

This is not strictly an IDE, but I tend to use jupyter notebook and find that it really helps with debugging. You can isolate different parts of your code to see which parts are working, and which parts aren't. Also it's free. 
Unforunately ZODB doesn't do those calculations on trees. It is too general purpose. I wanted to know if there was something that new about hierarchical statistics creation and maybe graphing out of the box - Just like Pandas does for array data. I am not interested in DB storage of the data; more in hierarchical data exploration. but thank you for your answer nonetheless :-)
Assignment due in 1.5 weeks to select two real-world datasets, apply * decision tree (with pruning?) * Neural Net * Boosted Decision Tree * SVM * KNN to them, and then write about why they're interesting. GA Tech ML class hello For work I'm running a frankly kind of shitty scraper against a frankly kind of shitty site to identify pages which are: * missing a head.title * missing a meta[name='description'] * contain any //img[not@alt] or //img[@alt=''] spoiler alert - many pages are timing out because dev is shitty, some pages are crashing, and nearly every page is only missing a meta description, which is not my responsibility to write, really. Otherwise I'm trying to set up a presentation at work to talk about how I applied some unsupervised learning algorithms to watson-provided NLP data (in format keyword: probability) in order to cluster some pages on the site. Doesn't really yield much but it's a little interesting. I need to think about how to use ML to add value to the business, but my best guess/approach is upsell the clients on simple ai features they don't really need by sounding smart. Which... is probably not smart.
Hey great m8
Hi, I will upload the test code from my laptop when i get home, as the work related code has sensitive info involved in there. Essentially, the issue revolves around using windows for multiprocessing code, what I have read so far is that it causes another python process to spawn with an exact copy of everything from the calling process. This is the issue, because on windows, all multiprocess code requires \_\_main\_\_ func which again gets called when the new process is spawned. This makes the multiprocessing really tough to do with PySimpleGUI, I used your non-blocking template as i wanted to introduce the illusion that its doing multiple things at once. &amp;#x200B; I found a fix though, it seem that I can just use concurrent.future's threadpoolexecutor, since I am not doing computations but just IO bound ops. This makes it much easier to manage as well. &amp;#x200B; Another thing i tried was using subprocess calls, however with PyInstaller it is a pain to reference the interpreter with the modules that are note standard libs. I was able to package a copy of the interpreter however, the PySimpleGUI module was not part of the libs. However, I think this has to do with how PyInstaller freezes modules and references them at runtime. I have been playing around with the bootloader as well as some run-time hooks to no avail. Although i will probably try to modify your module a bit to see if I can get it to freeze correctly. &amp;#x200B; All in all, LOVE your project, you have no idea how much this helps me deal with the actual business logic. To be honest making apps for internal use is not that glamorous, so often times people just go with CLI. I think it helps doing it using your module to make things standout more. Thanks so much for your help, stay tuned for later tonight, i will post the sample code with screenshots.
Use `setuptools.Extension` and make a module. You can then compile it in-place with `pip install -e .`. 
`pip install pyautogui` from the command line. Many packages do not provide Conda repos. 
&gt; Your definition had an obvious problem, viz. it assumed that objects must have finite number of fields, whereas there is no such requirement in reality. If you are using using `@attr.s` your object **will** have a finite number of fields. You get even get a finite list of these fields by calling `attr.fields()` on the class object.
You don't need Code runner, just press Ctrl+F5 to run the code without debugging. There's also the command *Run Python file in terminal* that you can run through the command palette, or bind to a shortcut in the preferences, I'm not sure what the difference is.
Vscode lacks in put/output for python
BTQ just tried PyCharm - its amazing. Night and day compared to other IDE's I tried. 
Genetic algorithm for an aspect of my phd! Simple, yet powerful.
Thanks
Anyone know how to get your tests to run automatically after a file is saved?
&gt;Searching Howto for crypto trader or Neural Network thx
If you're using code runner, add this line to settings.json and the code will execute in the terminal and accept input. "code-runner.runInTerminal": true,
Personally I found that whilst ctrl+f5 worked, it felt slower and used to stall on VSCode sometimes this was on 3 different PCs I had this issue. I haven't had an issue yet with coderunner since I've discovered it a few weeks ago.
In settings, you can also install different linters. I use flake8, and additionally, formatter to format code on autosave so you can get rid of some of linting violations(autopep8). I also recommend that you learn how to use debugger. Lastly, learn how to configure virtual envs. Linters and formatters get installed in current working python env
add the conda-forge channel to your installation of anaconda, either using the Navigator, or: conda config --add channels conda-forge then: conda install -c conda-forge pyautogui
Yeah... might wanna cut down on the sexual innuendo jokes - not a portfolio many will be interested in
You can run all test from command pallete. Press F1 and type and execute "Python: Run all unit tests". You don't need to type it all. There are different unit test libraries in settings (unittest,Nose,pytest) and they all recive some arguments on execution if you configure them so maybe there is something to invoke them automatically. 
Flask + pubsub + bigquery + data studio
Thanks!
I am working on the new version of my scheduled YouTube downloader which will download all new videos from channels I follow using my night time data https://github.com/mrsupiri/downbit Old version - https://github.com/mrsupiri/downbit_legacy
Pubsub ? Does it have to do something with real time ?
You can setup visual studio code. I know pycharm is great, but it costs. On the other hand, visual studio code most installed plugin is python and they work on it full time. It has excellent debuger, linters to install, formatters. And also, you can run any part of code with code runner plugin. Its amazing, trust me.
For my final project at university, i have to make real time auction. I thought using flask and socketio or something like realtime database, firebase or rethinkdb. Do you have any advice for real time with flask ?
[r/Python Official Job Board](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/8bx6md/rpython_official_job_board/)
 Here is how to do a hierarchical calculation in the ZODB. You can see the code here: [https://pythonlinks.info//presentations/zodbtalk.pdf#page=10](https://pythonlinks.info//presentations/zodbtalk.pdf#page=10) Page 10. Leaf nodes respond to the countLeaves method by returning 1. Branches with multiple leaves respond to the countLeaves method by returning the sum of their children’s videos. It is just what you would expect from Python, but these are persistent objects. You can see the numbers of videos in any branch of the tree over at [PythonLinks.info](https://PythonLinks.info) I run the calculation every time the tree changes. 
Ha ha ha... Just leave! Any idiot who falls for this shit deserves to get screwed by OP. Ideas are worth very little in reality; the implementation is worth everything. There is nothing in it for the person helping this person except a promise of potential massive profits. Profits that will never happen and if they do, a portion of which you will never see. Don't be a naïve fool and buy into this guy's bullshit. You could develop your own meme website and keep all the profits to yourself assuming you could even make it profitable at all! The fact that they thought they could use a website cloning script alone tells you how sceptical you should be. Also, they came into this with only $1300... Let that sink in a hit. A decent dev at the bargain price of only $25/hr would be expected to have built everything in at most 52 hours for the site alone nevermind the hosting costs, CDN costs and so on and so forth... 
&gt;Why did you decide to convince the owner otherwise if you don't even have data to support that position? Hey man, don't be too assuming. We haven't taken any decision yet, we are still in the midst of discussing our thing.
But will that still run within vscode 
Thank you very much! This is probably the genre of thing I was looking for! Gotta peruse some more.
Just google for "flask realtime app"... maybe something like https://github.com/kcarnold/flask-gevent-socketio-chat
Hi, I don't doubt that such hierarchical calculations can be coded in zodb - its just that there isn't much saved. I might as well code from scratch as I don't need a DB.
It really depends on your market. I do open source as well. My industry is still using Python 2. Then again, I code for Python 2 and 3 at the same time. I see no reason to continue Python 2 support other than my company uses it. At some point, your open source project has to decide. EOL is at the end of next year and other libraries are done at the end of this year. If you want a final year of Python 2 development, go ahead. Do you instead want 5 years of Python 2 development? How do you plan to support new and old versions of your dependencies? In the last month, numpy downloads passed 50% python 3 usage (according to their mailing list). Numpy's last release is later this year. They're confident enough... What I've started doing is removing six hacks. So no more iteritems, iterkeys, itervalues, PY2/PY3 if blocks. You get the python 3 version that's compatible with Python 2, but you get not quite as good performance as you used to. That's not true for the standard case, but for all the B-list functions, that's what you get. Python 3 is 30% faster on my library and uses less RAM. You should probably upgrade.
Hey, I'm just going off &gt;I and some other members tried to give a reason or two on why it is better to extend the support to 2.7. I'd like to do this by showing some factual, reliable data
I concur. Using selenium to navigate and then BeautifulSoup would be so slow! Use requests, your life will be so much better. 
Great stuff! Thanks for working on this. I'm glad you're finding uses for the package in your work. I understand the non-glamorous parts of toolsmithing, but it doesn't have to be dull and mundane if you add a nice looking front-end. I find that I like interacting with my own code a LOT more if I've got a decent interface to it. I'm having fun writing tools now rather than dreading them. You've got something else you can focus on than just command line. As you said, you can stress thing to your user. You're likely to pick up more users when they see how easy it is to interact with your code. :-) I hope that it's as easy for you to code as I'm finding it. It's easy for me to pop out applications in a few lines of code. If you run into any limitations let me know and those tend to be the areas I need to do more work in and it's a great motivator to get them done. A couple of people have been asking for ways to disable elements so I added a disable parameter to all of the element Update calls today. It'll be uploaded to PyPI later when I finish the documentation. Thanks for giving PySimpleGUI a try! -mike 
Awesome! You can now upload every copy to gist and sync with other devices 
asyncio support?
Also, checkout my official project that works to recreate the 2008 revision of the game! [https://www.piratesclassic.com/](https://www.piratesclassic.com/)
I'm not sure we're on the same page... It will run in the terminal but that terminal can be whatever terminal you've configured it to be - Most commonly on Windows this would be the Command Prompt or Powershell terminal. It's not really any different to opening Command prompt, navigating to the file and typing "python.exe filename.py"
Thank you so much! Good catch! Unfortunately the .exe files still end up in different folders, but at least they don't have the same name!

Pycharm is far superior to vs code for python development.
VS Community is full VS though, its a much bulkier IDE to VSCode’s more lightweight editor approach. If you were doing specifically Python development, and wanted a full IDE, i’d go for PyCharm, seems to be more aimed at this language and works great for me.
Maybe vscode has changed but in my own past experience with vscode this tutorial misses one vital issue. Auto formatting. Because with only linting installed I noticed that vscode was leaving a lot of blank lines in my code that the linter obviously didn't like due to pep8 and such. I could never figure this out and I didn't explore further what formatting options I had with python so after a month or so I went back to good old vim. While I was trying out vscode I ended up having to go into Vim to perform certain search and replace operations I was used to and couldn't figure out how to do in vscode. So eventually it felt futile to continue using vscode.
Vscode is a text editor not a fully featured IDE
Sorry to be a downer, but I think this is a step in the wrong direction. Golang style concurrency is bad, as Nathaniel Smith definitively demonstrates on his blog. https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/ The channels idea is not very pythonic either. We just got [async generators in python 3.6](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0525/). They do everything channels does better, and if you need even more you should look libraries like [aiostream](https://github.com/vxgmichel/aiostream).
I also noticed that a virtual env wasn't used and have read that they are recommended. That's why I like that Pycharm has virtual env management features. I'll probably end up making aliases if I ever have to stop using Pycharm
Definitely PyCharm, but for debugging also check out [birdseye](https://github.com/alexmojaki/birdseye).

True, although VS Code is meant to be light weight and the full featured VS Community is very heavy. For Django, VS Code is perfect
There is if you don't always code in Python. I do a ton of LaTeX and other odd jobs here and there, so having a single text editor that can help do all the things is quite nice.

&gt; "For diversity reasons, it would be nice to try to avoid 'master' and 'slave' terminology which can be associated to slavery," he explained in his bug report, noting that there have been complaints but they've been filed privately – presumably to avoid being dragged into a fractious flame war.

I just tried to repeat the process. Had to fix three uncaught parser exceptions in twitter_scraper just to get it to run all the way through. Twitter bounces me with error 429 "too many requests" after I process about three accounts (out of 32). Fortunately, adding a short (5-10 s) delay after each account takes care of that. And plotting commands (sns.barplot, etc.) seem to do nothing at all. Either I don't have things set up correctly or some initialization code is missing. Python 3.7, Windows 10, all modules freshly pip'd today. That said, I've managed to rerun the results and add a few articles/speeches to the mix. Elaine Chao and John Kelly are outliers, because only they have 6 and 5 tweets respectively in their accounts and that skews the results (especially after you cut their feeds into 4 chunks each). Your code does not remove all links and it leaves all # and @'s untouched, which is a problem because one of the metrics in the analysis package is 'symbols per sentence'. Taking care of that changes the ordering somewhat. I also took out "uppercase words per sentence" and "exclamation marks per sentence" metrics (both are a lot less likely to occur in an essay than in a tweet). After these changes, the results are as follows: Tweets: PressSec (Sarah Sanders): 97.4% SecNielsen: 97.1% SecPompeo: 96.9% SecretaryCarson: 96.8% SecretarySonny (Sonny Perdue): 96.7% SecretaryZinke: 96.7% VP: 96.6% nikkihaley: 96.3% BetsyDeVosED: 96.2% SecAzar: 96.2% Articles/books: Fiona Hill: 95.5% Paul Krugman: 95.3% John J Sullivan: 93.9% Alexandre Dumas ("The Three Musketeers"): 89.8% Richard Bach ("Jonathan Livingston Seagull"): 86.9% Mark Twain ("The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"): 75.6%
Yes, but if someone does (rightfully) have an edu address, they should use it to their power. Without going into detail a lot of my work is in the education center, and schools are poorly funded (don't get good software, for programming or just for general workflow) at every level, from K-12 and beyond. Of course, there are always free alternatives, but they are always worse. Sometimes because of course, less work is done on them, because people aren't getting paid, or simply because a different tool has become a defacto standard before the free tool caught up (ex MS Office &amp; &lt;Libre/Open&gt;Office). So if you do have access to an edu email (rightfully) or a service simply requires proof of being a student or educator, then it should be used. Jetbrains even has education versions of their software as a step before moving on to the pro editions.
I can set the `name='main'` to the same thing in `COLLECT` but then it wants to overwrite when there is already files in that directory. I can't seem to find the docs for `COLLECT`. There should be "Yes it is okay to merge" option.

Does it not work if you put every call through asyncio? If there's something I need to do to add compatibility, please let me know.
Looks like it performs blocking io with requests
Have you looked into PyTables?
and read the sidebar.
Maybe I'm missing something because I'm not the most experienced with asyncio, but it appears to be working for me: Input: import asyncio import odota async def test(): x = odota.Load() print(x.health()['steamApi']['timestamp']) async def test2(): y = odota.Load() print(y.status()['user_players']) async def main(): tasks = [test(), test2()] await asyncio.gather(*tasks) asyncio.run(main()) Output: 1536706835 695403
To test if this approach actually detects what it is intended to detect, I've added Krugman to the list of feeds and tried to find the feed that best matches one of his recent columns. It actually does work: his feed is by far the best match to his column. Numbers vary depending on the set of input feeds (e.g. removing the two outliers Kelly and Chao narrows the range of metrics and therefore lowers the match scores for everyone), but, in my last run, I got 92.2% for Krugman vs. 88.0% for the second closest match (Carson) and 75-85% for most others. 
It won't be able to download both results at the same time. The test and test2 coroutines never `await`, and all the network calls block the event loop
If I'm doing a quick script I go for vscode. If it's a full web app or project then yeah pycharm. 
Ah, well I'm sorry about that. You're welcome to make a fork and have it use AIOHTTP instead. Apparently that package can make asynchronous HTTP calls. Although if there's a way I can modify this package in order to make it work with asyncio, please let me know.
I was in the same position 6 years ago, and now have a fully automated syncing system to move progress from Khan Academy to our LMS gradebook. I would be happy to help you with any questions you may have. I made a [python 3 wrapper](https://github.com/jb-1980/KhanAPI) for the API that should not be too hard to set up. You will still probably come up against some implementation details. Such as what exercises are you using and trying to find the scores? Our LMS stores the slug with the page, so I now get the list from the database. But when I began I had a separate json file with all the exercise slugs. If you have any questions as you are developing this, I would be happy to help you find the answers.
argparse is too complex for simple use case. Use [Clize or alternatives](https://clize.readthedocs.io/en/stable/alternatives.html).

It's not that - I have no module of my own to compile, this is to do with unresolved symbols when using the high-level Python API to call a script that imports libraries that are present in shared object (.so) / shared library form.
As I stated, I tried compiling everything with dynamic loads as well and get the same result. I have all libraries specified and ldd / strace reports they're all dynamically loaded at runtime. I found a comment on another post somewhere where the Python library was pre-loaded via LD\_PRELOAD as a workaround, although that just causes the binary to crash in my case.

From now on I will capitalize the terms MASTER and SLAVE and emphasize them everywhere I can.
I can understand how the term "slave" could be considered offensive, and hence "master" and "slave" together, but is anyone offended by the word "master" in isolation? Most of these changes don't involve the word "slave" at all.

Penetration testing is triggering for rape victims. Hell even homebrew is triggering for people who have had negative experiences with alcoholics. Doesn't mean anything has to change. Because people getting hurt by these words are refusing to examine the CONTEXT. This is a meaningless gesture for the vocal minority of sjws who think this shit is important.
I'm on board with this one. Regardless of whether or not you think it's offensive, every time I've used it in a professional setting I've had to explain to someone what it means in this context.
I apologize, never used windows or mac. What is a .exe? Is it like a .sh file or a specific coding language script? 
Parent and worker is two mismatched halves. Parent and child would be fine, manager and worker would be fine.
BTW, curses lives on in this form: &gt; Urwid is a console user interface library for Python. Urwid offers an alternative to using Python’s curses module directly and handles many of the difficult and tedious tasks for you. http://urwid.org/tutorial/index.html Also; this type of question is better suuted to /r/learnpython 
&gt; Is anyone offended by the word "master" in isolation? I assume from the downvotes that the answer to this question is "yes".
Looks like the link is broken.
\ E D G Y /
On the contrary, I've never had to explain master/slave, to anybody, regardless of whether or not english is their first language, but I've seen coworkers having to do so for these new politically correct phrases.
&gt;Manager and child would be... not fine. Pretend child labor is acceptable and it sounds fine.
Yes, I do have to think hard about the master slave one, because that's literally *one* country with history of slavery that is over 100 years past. Yes slavery is wrong. Yes what happened was horrible. But no, we shouldn't be changing our vocabulary because of it. Will the word "terror" be removed from our vocabulary in any sense except for terror attacks in the year 2101? I hope not.
Master slave is also only offensive in this context with neck twisting. The point is that master/slave in the context of computers has nothing to do with slavery in the world. 
Yeah, I don't expect anyone to use a text editor like VSCode to manage a full blown Python project. It's fine for making edits to a few scripts here and there, but I personally use Pycharm for bigger projects and course work.
It's Urwid now?
Wait...do you consider 100 years to be a long time?
I like the proposition to change them to "pimp" and "ho" Seriously speaking, there are certain words in a language that are offensive. The words themselves exist for the sole purpose of being grotesque and offensive. We avoid these words in professional settings because their intended use is offense. A programming language isn't going to adopt these words (except brainfuck, which is kind of the point of it anyway), and if it had we should try to remove them. However, this is a set of words that have a specific meaning that is perfectly applicable in context. But they want to remove them using vague nonsense such as "could be interpreted as discriminatory or offensive" to justify changing decade-old norms for no reason than toe appease the offended. If you want to remove a term like "bonerforest" from a language we can probably all agree that it doesn't belong. But master and slave are perfect adjectives to describe certain relationships in an environment and are not offensive at all in this context. The onus is on the offended to educate themselves on the language rather than the language for protecting those who are offended by something rather benign. But most importantly this isn't about changing two words. Its about settings a precedent and creating a culture where being offended means you get what you want with no consideration for how valid your offended-ness is. Following this we must now remove any reference to blacklist or whitelist. We must remove the term 'inheritance' because it "could be interpreted as discriminatory or offensive" to those who don't know their parents. We must do away with the term 'class' so people don't feel bad about being in a lower social or economic class. We have to rename the interpreter if enough people are offended that they only speak one language. The slippery slope analogy can be thin, but where do we draw the line? We know that master and slave are on the bad side of the line despite being perfectly applicable words, so now we have to go through and apply the same process to any words that anyone at any point that "could be interpreted as discriminatory or offensive". This is ridiculous.
...do you not? It's an entire lifetime now, and 1-1.5 lifetimes 100 years ago. You wouldn't be typing your question on whatever device you had a hundred years ago. You'd be meeting in person discussing with everyone on this thread.
Why would anyone side with the pro slave side? I’m pretty sure slavery is bad. 
Wrote a simple but effective script with PyEphem for calculating all satellite transits of the sun or moon for a given observer position over a specified time span. [https://github.com/AstronomyLiveYt/TransitSearch/blob/master/transitsearch.py](https://github.com/AstronomyLiveYt/TransitSearch/blob/master/transitsearch.py) Next project is to incorporate PyEphem into my sat tracking program for my telescope.
What would be the point of checking the type hints at runtime? Checking them before running the code is the point why they exist - if you find out there's a type discrepancy at runtime in production, it's already too late to do anything about it.
What about using a vim extension in vscode for the best of both worlds?
To quote another comment from a thread about redis: &gt; “Master/slave” isn’t even a good metaphor, unless I’m missing the historical example where slaves lived a life identical to their master’s with sub-second delays just in case one of them suddenly needed to step in and replace the master if he died...
The master-slave terminology either matters or it doesn't. If it matters, then we should change it. If it doesn't matter, then why make a fuss over it being changed?
The linked article is good but I'm not sure I agree with the statement that "golang style concurrency is bad". I remember a time when I considered everything not purely functional to be bad though, and that time has passed. I am aware of async generator and aiostream (by the way, in aiochan channels are async generators) and for our use cases they are definitely not powerful enough. Specifically, it is not clear how to have fine control of back pressure when using aiostream, and --- this is a big and --- there is no \`select\`, so if you ever want any sort of non-trivial branching in your dataflow you are left on your own.
If it doesn't matter, why does changing it take priority over the other 6,788 open issues in Python?
Because it applies perfectly to the situation. One is in control of the other. How about when you are "Killing processes", I am pretty sure "killing is bad", it fits. You are ending the life of the process. 
Yes, but the article and original point, as well as most of occurences of these changes, seem to stem specifically from US slavery. US specific or not, context matters.
You guys are all wrong. This is not about humans at all. People are realizing AI is coming and they want to be nicer to our soon to be overlord. Nobody knows which process is going to become sentient first so better not mistakenly call it slave. :) 
Yes. Qt is easier and better documented at a price.
But do you not then have to explain what parent and worker means in context? If you say the problem is people not understanding the context do you not have to explain it when using parent/worker? It seems to be *less* descriptive because parents and workers have no natural relationship. Masters and slaves make it immediately clear that one object is in charge of the other. So how do your clients react to parent/worker?
I'd much rather see (and log) an exception at runtime at the earliest possible moment over having unexpected/undefined behavior propagate leading to a harder to debug error further down the line, or worse, silent incorrect behavior that I might not notice for a long time. This is true for a testing/staging environment, and doubly true for a production environment. There are legitimate reasons why runtime typechecks are a questionable idea. But "there's no point to failing at run time" isn't one of them.
Context matters in the sense that this is a programming language and it isn't referring to subjugating a race or culture.
I recently tried to do something similar and came upon this simple solution. Here is the start of my script: import sys inFile = sys.argv[1] outFile = sys.argv[2] I've never used argparse, but most likely either \`COORD1\` and \`COORD2\` require their own flags or a single flag but separated with say a comma. Something like this: &amp;#x200B; pyton3 console.py -i FILENAME -c1 COORD1 -c2 COORD2 pyton3 console.py -i FILENAME -c COORD1,COORD2 &amp;#x200B;
petition to rename them to "Master" and "Nigger"
Tbh the first time I read master/slave the first image that popped into my mind was (and still is) a BDSM related one. I'm pretty neutral on the subject: if people are bothered by it, change it, otherwise don't waste time.
That's exactly what I'm saying, in case you thought the opposite...
Voice control light switch
Nobody is offended by master in isolation. One can be called a master of their art, and in some contexts is can be used as an honorific, like in a martial arts context. The word that makes people uncomfortable here is slave, not master. Besides, worker/manager is just as accurate a phrase in most contexts, and doesn't make me feel uncomfortable to explain the terms.
I don't know what to think any more.
Also, worker/manager is one that's nearly identical, and already an established term.
This is fucking stupid. 
Those are actually good terms, I think. Maybe 'replica' instead of 'standby' or something, but those are obviously technical and not related to any human relationships and also clear on what they are.
Are you implying that managerial employees are necessarily childless? How offensive!
Rename sudo to would-you-kindly please
Banning words just give them power. Words are just sounds. We define their meaning. If we are offended by the word or ban it we just give it power. Like kids who were told not to swear, swore with their friends. And even relished in using those “bad” words. It’s better to use the words so the memory is not forgotten. Let the words have a history But also language is living. Let them develop into connected but slightly different meaning. This seems to be driven by a PC warrior looking for a fight. 
When will python join movement to dump shit interpreter performance? We want a php7 moment for CPython, not some dumb ass sjw moment.
Are you looking for algorithmic tips? If you’re trying to write a program to solve the differential equations on your own, the Runge-Kutta method is a good place to start. If correctness (speaking in terms of preserving the total energy of the system) is especially important, investment symplectic integrators (aka Hamiltonian integrators). The semi-implicit Euler step is a great place to start here. If, instead, you don’t care about the details of solving the system of differential equations, use scipy’s `odeint` function. It uses advanced integration techniques hidden behind a really easy-to-use API. Again, if energetic correctness is important, I’m sure scipy has a symplectic integrator hidden away somewhere. Sooner or later, you will have to formulate a system of ordinary differential equations. The scipy `odeint` documentation has some great examples. In terms of how to formulate the forces on the objects, my advice would be to ignore inter-planet forces and just stick with Sun-planet forces. Otherwise things get a little more complicated. 
name it whatever you want, the concept of master and slave will still exist and it will still offend someone in the world. Lets stop killing processes and let then live forever happy flowers. Lets stop having slaves and give all processes/machines equal privileges! Root user has more privileges than other users, this could offend someone so give equal permissions to everyone please. My cousin died by a python bite and I am offended everytime I have to type "python" in the terminal, please everyone understand and rename the language to "happyness" I am offended because all these people who defend others (which could be offended by something) are culturally appropiating their feelings.
The bullies win again.
Looks cool. Source?
parent/worker is... a thousand times less descriptive.
Noob to python just learning basic things. How do I do something like this?
parent/child is only a good alternative if you, like most python developers, know literally nothing about linux.
It's hilarious though, so at least it has that.
At this rate it will soon be dumped from dictionaries too!
Next we cannot "mount" devices, set up "raid" servers, "fire" a signal, "kill" a child process, nor use red-black tree structures.
Very true, I don’t know why I didn’t think of that
I made it myself, so I guess I’m the source. It’s for a school art project
It’s not hard, it’s just a lot of recursion. If you want to learn how to make something similar, look up “python turtle art” and you’ll find tons of things similar to this
Intro to computer science. I’m new in the neighborhood.
I think you took a woodworking course.
Great! I'm sick of the phrase. I'm not involved in CPython development of course, but I really can't see how minor changes like this would impact other development that greatly. A few PRs to change variable names and documentation. One of the shittiest phrases in engineering removed from a programming language.
Also I’m a freshman about 3 weeks into college and this is my first year using python, so if I can do this, you can too
&gt; Following this we must now remove any reference to blacklist or whitelist. We must remove the term 'inheritance' because Wait a minute... What *is* the history on how those words came to be?
I think they mean the source code, if you are comfortable sharing it that is (you might not be able to since it's a school project, be careful here). 
Sorry, but you’ve got it back to front. Anyone can claim to be offended by anything, and some may even actually be. So the question then is what to do about it, with one of the possible choices being _Absolutely nothing at all, because in this case the offended are out of touch with reality_.
I find it sad that SJW bullshit as entered tech.
Stupid
I would just like to point out that it probably depends on who is doing the neck twisting to determine how offensive something is. It is totally possible that there are people, *ahem* people who are black, that may not have to twist their neck as much as you.
Obviously not ayyy lmao

Alright thank you! Ideally i will try both methods, and compare the results
English is a living language. It changes every day a tiny bit. If you were to travel 100 years back in time, people would have a hard time understanding what you say. So what's wrong with changing the language in a way that keeps the meaning but removes offense? Unlike people on this thread suggest, there are not an infinite number of such potential changes, but a rather limited set.
A video about the debugger will follow, this was just a getting started
I dont like the idea that people bring different value to conversations based on skin color, bit racist. I think we all neck twist equally :) which is why this change is useless
You're either full of shit or out of your depth but either way people shouldn't buy into your bullshit. If you pay somebody for a website all you get is raw code... What did you think you were going to get? You'd still have to pay somebody to deploy it for you, then there is hosting costs and so on and so forth... Whilst I do a lot of web dev it isn't my core business and I always make people understand that they're paying me for a site and that deployment costs more. A meme website that can handle a couple hundred simultaneous users 24hrs/365days is going to cost a decent sum to host alone because of how media rich the site is... We're talking an easy $500+ a month whilst I believe we're looking more in the $1000+ range. Always what about managing the server? What about managing the site and maintaining it? I can guarantee that the reports alone will keep a single person busy full time... Do you have the money to pay them a salary? The fact that you haven't even considered hosting costs alone is worrying... 
That looks great! I love it, and want one!

&gt;If it doesn't matter, then why make a fuss over it being changed? Because arbitrarily thrashing the language for no reason invalidates historical documentation, including documentation that cannot be easily updated, like books and stack overflow questions. It also brings the terminology *out* of consistency with a significant body of computer science knowledge. It also gives me a headache.

We generally have to policy to put on GitHub anything that's easily reusable or especially useful for others. This one was put on our private GitLab instance instead because it was considered too specific (tied to a specific data model, to the provinces of Belgium, ...) to be easily reusable. To be honest, there are also a few lines of code and design decisions I'm not proud of. I'll talk to my manager and to the people we developed this website for to see if there's any objections, and if no I'll push a copy to GitHub. I guess it'll be fine :) &amp;#x200B;

The actual changesets were all improvements in clarity though. I'm guessing that's why the thread was merged and killed. It seems less slaying dragons and more exterminating vermin. I don't think the headline is an appropriate reflection of the thread.
My first question is whether the 'worker' process is a child process of the 'parent' process? Or are they 2 separate processes one of which is controlled by the parent process?
Master slave relationships has existed for as long as humanity. If you think otherwise you need to brush up on history. It is not a question about color.
Just wait until machines has taken all our jobs and see where that manager worker metaphor will bring you. I will be offende I tell you! /s

You are ranting. Language evolves with our choices, we all make little corrections to fit the times. Bowdlerization can be a problem, but so too is having little fights over nothing with people who misinterpret one's intent. However, you need not be concerned. From your sense of humor and the use of the term SJW, I can know your intent without any leaps of logic. You are in a position of power which is supplemented by your external, unearned characteristics, and you find it funny to refer to objects with terms which when used to refer to people that you yourself see as below you are dehumanizing. I find it funny that your joke has exposed you as one of life's little monsters, thus invalidating any validity to your raving argument in my eyes.

Yes, people have tried this. - The general concept is basically that you're implementing static typing via "design by contract". `dpcontracts` is a good library for more general pre- and postcondition checking, if you're interested. - I remember seeing a comparison of four libraries for type enforcement somewhere on a PEP-related github discussion. In short, all had known bugs (some just bugs, one marked "incomplete") but more importantly a **~300x** performance gap (that is, thirty thousand percent) when dealing with generic types like `List[int]`. The usual result is to decide that an offline type checker (usually `mypy`) works well, and contorting your code for runtime type-checking usually adds more bugs than it prevents - to say nothing of the human labor and performance cost. So use type annotations, statically check them, and then move on and add `dpcontracts` or `hypothesis` [or both](https://www.hillelwayne.com/talks/beyond-unit-tests/) instead.

This is the literal definition of an ad hominem. Attack the argument, not the speaker. You're right, language does change and evolve, just as it can have different uses. As someone points out on the bugs.python.org issue, "master" and "slave" can also have positive definitions. The Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary lists "slave" as also meaning "a device that is directly controlled by another one" - a definition that no doubt has evolved from use in computing, so in this case, language has evolved from a "dehumanising" definition to a technical one. I don't mind "leader" and "follower" as a replacement, as the same technical meanings can be derived but I'll probably end up using Master/Slave accidentally in everyday use as that's what I'm used to. I hope this kind of change won't lead to the demonisation of people that aren't aware of the change, forgetful or set in their ways.
Snek
When the speaker has revealed his bigotries, I will attack without qualm. I'm not trying to win debate club. The hatred of the bigot is the issue, front and center, and I am not obligated to play nice when those I respect and care for are casually degraded.

I'm offended by word "happyness"! I'm not happy and this makes me mad. Come up with a different name, and be prepared that it is going to offend someone else. &amp;#x200B; On a serious note, how the developers can be so irrational? Why should "master"/"slave" be pushed into a human context? Those are concepts and are happen to have same names. If we are so pedantic, when why not change the language entirely? Make a single world language without ambiguities, where every word has only single meaning? And why not just force people to do what we want, if wee feel offended, not very much unlike what slave masters did? &amp;#x200B; On the last note, isn't humanity is better off with remembering what the slavery is, not forgetting it? You know that saying about history and repeating mistakes...
It reminds me how communists and nazis forced scientists and engineers to use 'correct' terms in accordance with official ideology. It's absolutely same.
I personally use mypy as a ‘very picky linter’, to ensure that I’m conceptually understanding and implementing types logically. If I wanted stricter types than that, I’d use Haskell (which I greatly prefer!). I also use a lot of Haskell design patterns in Python when working with types (although don’t go as far as using any specific libraries for Haskell’s category theory elements).
This is why Guido left. 
Where did you do that? 
Yeah but many people would rather pretend black people don't exist 
Hi everyone, I'm presenting this at Pycon UK in a few days, but wanted to post it here first. Aletheia is a little project I've been hacking on that's designed to help people and institutions attach their names &amp; reputation to the files they create, so that the rest of us can better determine whether we should trust the image/audio/video we're looking at on the internet. Importantly, **this isn't DRM**: the metadata attached to the file can be scrubbed or ignored without modifying the actual data. This is just a way to guarantee the authenticity and origin of a thing on the internet -- [something I think we're going to need in the coming years](http://futureoffakenews.com/videos.html). Right now, Aletheia supports `jpeg`, `mp3`, `mkv`, `mp4`, `webm`, and `html` files, but the list of supported formats is growing. If you'd like to contribute to that list, or help with things like porting or packaging, hit me up. I'm happy to answer any questions, but please be nice. This project represents a great deal of my free time over the last year. * Python code is [here](https://github.com/danielquinn/pyletheia) * The project code (proof of concept, presentation, whitepaper) is [here](https://github.com/danielquinn/aletheia) * The slides for my Pycon UK talk are [here](https://danielquinn.github.io/aletheia/presentation/) * The RadioLab story that started me down this path is [here](http://futureoffakenews.com/videos.html)

Not sure what benchmarks you're looking at, but comparing memory usage between languages that have different runtimes is generally a bad idea.
Psychological attacks like this one are purposed to make you feel unreal. In reality, those groups are similar to windows evangelists their purpose is to subvert destroy or take power.
