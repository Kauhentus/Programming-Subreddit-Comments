&gt; Would there be interest in a library with classes and tools to support various NLP/Geoprocessing tasks? Yes, I think that u/smarmyducky would love such tools, apparently (s)he needs something like that. *wink* But seriously... the beauty of open source is that you don't need to ask anyone's permission. If *you* have a need, start scratching your own itch. Use open source tools and so long as you obey the licence conditions you can copy them, fork them, merge them, whatever it takes to solve your problem. And by releasing it as open source, you can encourage other people in the Geo field to (1) use it and (2) contribute back. (You'll probably have more interest in geospacial circles than NLP circles, and generic Python programmer circles tend to be pretty cool about anything which they personally aren't using.) Good luck!
Well to begin with, the qt framework was quite difficult to get used to, especially if you are using multiple windows and a lot of events/signals. At the start I couldn’t get the second UI window to keep open. Another thing is, that some of the qt commands work on windows but not on the pi, and your Programm will simply crash without a error message. And i bought the wrong relays first (12V (secondary power circuit) voltage instead of 5V (Pi power circuit) ones)
To install libraries for python 3.7 use pip3 instead of pip You can also check which ones are installed by doing pip freeze or pip3 freeze If you still are having trouble try working in virtualenv

Oh you mean mean real forensics labs aren't just run by a single goth polymath babe who does literally everything? Holy suspension of disbelief! The rank and file writers for these high volume shows are mostly in their early 20s. Trust me, they know exactly what they are doing when they try to slip hilariously over the top bullshit lines onscreen. Shit like this absolutely becomes a competition in the writers room.
And even then it's not true, you can code in other languages than Java for Android.

Does anyone have the clip?
You can make Windows, Linux, OSX, iOS and Android apps with PyQt with essentially the same codebase.
20 years of Java here and that is my experience as well. Too much work to convince the compiler I know what I am doing and then all that extra code hides the real errors that takes forever to track down. Using not Java every opportunity I get.
I’d say the main differences are the typing (Java’s static vs JavaScript’s dynamic), the runtime environment (JVM vs browser/nodejs), the execution style (compiled vs interpreted), common patterns (OOP vs ...not), and typical frameworks (mature vs fresh). But hey they’re both Turing complete, so that’s one thing in common!
I've recently built my first mobile apps using kivy. The "Buildozer" tool used to create Android APKs is using the "Python for Android" module, which is using some kind of Java functionality at some point because a Java JDK is required to use it. However, once you get the compiler to run properly, the entire development and build process is pretty easy. Some people argue that kivy apps are too slow, but most of the time that is the result of bad code or using the wrong kivy elements for the job.

Python ints are "Big Nums" and they can be as big as you have memory, up to tens of thousands or millions of digits or more, and they will be exact. Be warned that huge numbers may take a while to generate, and even longer to print. On my old slow PC, it took about three minutes to do this: py&gt; a = 10**1000000 + 1 py&gt; s = str(a) py&gt; print(len(s), s[:10] + '...' + s[-10:]) 1000001 1000000000...0000000001 (most of the time was in the second line, converting the int into a string), which is not surprising when you realise just how *big* such bignums can get: py&gt; sys.getsizeof(a) # Size in bytes of the big num. 442936 Python floats are C longs, so 64 bits of precision, not 16. You can get more info about the float implementation by inspecting [`sys.float_info`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.float_info). Also available in [Python 2](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.float_info). The `decimal.Decimal` data type is separate from both, and has variable precision which the user can set. The default precision is 28 decimal digits: py&gt; import decimal py&gt; decimal.getcontext().prec 28 and I don't know the maximum off the top of my head. (Possibly limited by memory.) Calculations with `Decimal` (like `float`) are not always exact, some calculations will be rounded.
You mean the collective “we”. *We are the Borg… resistance is futile.*

You could use Qt framework for crossplatform development to make the interface with QML and glue everything with Python.

Really nice !
Javascript, and Typescript moreso, is a fantastic language. Maybe grow up and don’t get tribal over tools.
&gt; JavaScript is not for apps React native would like a word.
Appreciate the content / baseline to jumpstart my R&amp;D for Drone Tech 👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
To be fair Python sucks a lot more then Javascript.
Ok I'll give it a try
Already had the first detection notification! Very nice :)
All of these have been made using a 3D renderer I made in Python from scratch. I recently released an update that lets you make animations using this small, custom programming language I made for it. If you want to make your own animations and renders, here's the github page: [https://github.com/Forfunckle/rendeer](https://github.com/Forfunckle/rendeer) And here's the docs for animations: [https://github.com/Forfunckle/rendeer/wiki/Using-ALAN](https://github.com/Forfunckle/rendeer/wiki/Using-ALAN)
How does it make more sense? How is Python more "standard" than Java?
Java and Javascript are two entirely different languages. They're only named similarly because the creators of Javascript wanted a popularity boost by being associated with Java!
Surprising! Didn't think Hollywood knew about Python.👍👍
It does! More Python the merrier!
Uh nope, you can build phone apps with a variety of things but not exclusively JavaScript.
If you use nodejs to run JS, then it’s run single threaded. There isn’t any parallelism. Pythons multithreading (still there’s the GIL) and multiprocessing libraries are very usable. The new async syntax in python and libraries using them are, to me, still a bit confusing, that’s true.
Same here, new to programming in python but like my other projects, I just have to start, I prefer to force myself first thing when I get up, or late late at night so my mind isn’t boggled with other shit. But once I get going I usually get on a role.
Step 1. Give up Step 2. Watch netflix Step 3. ??? Step 4. Life falls apart
Just tell yourself to code for one minute. One minute is better than nothing and most of the time I find myself coding for way longer than that. The hardest part is getting started. For what it’s worth, I use this technique for a lot of things (working out, reading, etc).
I actually took a crack at making a python-&gt;wasm assembler using type annotations. Got it to successfully assemble a Fibonacci program. It's not difficult, just time consuming.
OP DELIVERED HERE: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/c9wetp/simulating_a_source_of_light_and_a_lens_using/et5ajxj
Just tell yourself you're going to do 5 minutes. Then watch 5 turn into 10, 15, 30, etc.
Yes, dear friends, back in my day, Java was the language used by cool kids!

Don't forget using threads with globals and expecting it to work
It is with the library kivvy
It depends on the industry
“Look, you come to us and say you want an app that can put a GeoFence around a specific target so you can blockchain into their mobile device using IP load balancers and GUI routers. That’s cool, I totally get it. But what if I told you that you could also install a firewall around the devices CPU allowing you full access to its heat-sink partition and tokenized interweb chambers? Python my friend. Python can do all that and more.”
Bloated in what way?

Hey! I tried this on a windows pc. I couldn’t find the text files that were being saved, any work arounds?
JavaScript is actually the most effective for simple apps using something like NativeScript or Ionic. 1 codebase for Android and iOS.
r/woosh
The point of this program is to add up all numbers from 0 to num. So while num is still greather than 0, add num to the sum, and then subtract 1 from the num. So for num = 3, sum = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6. For num = 4, sum = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10
In this example, since the shape is pretty complex n = 30, which means that there are 30 circles rotating clockwise, 30 anticlockwise and one that doesn't rotate
I used pygame because i already knew how to use it a bit, all i'm doing is drawing each pixel in the path every frame update, which is crazy inefficient, but was easy to write
Looks like you're not specifying the sheet correctly? You have sheet1 and sheet2 but you're saying sheet.
I tend to have the opposite issue. I have an idea in my head for days or weeks (having kids, the spare time I do get, is spread fairly thin) and can't wait to start. So usually I have a good idea of what I want to do before I sit down - although occasionally I will get writers block. My problem is finishing the job, sometimes I have done the interesting bit or proved the concept but can't build the enthusiasm to complete the project - most of the time this is due to the length of time I have thought about it, or that I have had another idea I want to try.
Yeah, once I start, I can't stop thinking about it until I finish.
The indentation is wrong. while num&gt;0: sum = sum+num num -= 1 print("The sum is", sum)
I think you can make mobile apps with Kivy, don’t know how good it is though
"like everything except they're both programming languages"
What path did you enter when you started the program?
&gt;https://github.com/Forfunckle/rendeer/wiki/Using-ALAN Looks great! I'll try to play with it soon.
What bugs have you faced? I've faced one that if you declare an arg as accepting multiple values then referencing an arg will make it a list, regardless of it accepts multiple or not for that command. It was easy to workaround tho, just renane the arg
Just like getting rite and right confused 😉
This looks amazing, going to try out as soon as I am home from vacation!
To answer the question more directly... * Find a project that is interesting or excites you. * In your spare time away from the computer, think how you are going to go about it. How will you split it up in parts/functions/classes? How will the data be structured and processed? What part will you work on next? * Maybe have a template python file to start from. * Set little goals to achieve in your next coding session. * Perhaps give yourself a deadline (I'm not a fan of this).
JavaScript can absolutely do OOP, it's just not enforced like Java. And the compilation vs interpretation is a bit complex : Java is compiled to bytecode that is then interpreted, and all modern JavaScript engines do some pretty complex JIT compilation.
This is a really cool accomplishment. I could never figure something like this out. Nice job.
Thanks!

Motivation is bullshit. Discipline is forever.
Starting is the easy part, it's finishing that's hard :)

No guarantee that it'll help, but at least you'll understand what's happening.
The UI probably wouldn't be in python, but the core backens could totes be in python or JavaScript. Most apps these days are just UI that make API calls. That way you can spread your services across devices and platforms.
Lol go on, brave one...
Python actually is VFX standard. &amp;#x200B; Python 2.7 &amp;#x200B; Though should be updated to Py3 around Py2 EOL - which is actually quite soon now. 2020-01-01
Yeah this seems like the best practice for my issue. Thanks for taking the time to go over it either way!
And here I am trying to light up an LED. hahaha jokes Nice job, dude!
might want to look at https://brython.info/
&gt; Some people argue that kivy apps are too slow, but most of the time that is the result of bad code or using the wrong kivy elements for the job. I feel like that could be applied to a *lot* of software. After all, languages and frameworks and such are all just tools. Granted, some are built more for certain domains (like JavaScript for web frontends), but what matters most is *always* the brain behind the keyboard. In the hands of a neophyte, even the best tools are rendered worthless.
Yes, haven't used 2 7 in a while using 3.7 some 3 6 now.
Checklist of very small tasks you can knock out one at a timep
Instead, why don't you create a github repository with the code. Looks like too much effort for me.
I know this might not be a popular response but... drugs. I had the exact same problem as you OP, then I went to a psychiatrist. Was prescribed lexapro and adderall. I'm blown away by how much it's changed my behavior and my life. Don't know if it will work for you, but it doesn't hurt to talk to someone.
Set short-term goals that make progress towards your long-term goal. Set a routine with well-defined times and limits to work duration. Simple but not easy.
A few safe places to start would be looking into Microsoft certs on Windows Server or AWS certs on xyz. Not required, but good knowledge to have for anyone working in tech in general. The cost is relatively low, but having certs on the environment you'll be working in is always good to have.
Created the course for people who want to learn how to do it. Trust me, creating a course was way bigger task for me. 🙄
I know that. It is definitely not easy. But way too much effort. Just wondering if you have a business case. But let me know what you think

absolutely same here, cant start but once i do i really enjoy it and get lost in working on it. wtf brain? stupid shit &amp;#x200B; its rooted in convincing ourselves things are too big/too difficult/not worth doing i think
To me, it is absolutely legitimate. Why it shoudn't be?
Exactly. And next thing you see is 5pm and time to go home. :)
Yep, py3 is better. I think py3 would have gotten much faster adoption if the print statement had not been killed (replacing with print function) IMO, sensible solution there would be to keep print statement, and have it wrap print function.
Deadlines.
My common ones are debugging a broken message is a pain. Args that start with the same letter have issues, even if you don’t have short options. Negative numbers don’t work. There are workarounds that you can do (change your flags), but I shouldn’t have to. I do some screen long docopt messages as well as ones that chain for multiple levels. I shouldn’t have to fight with my language.

Yeah, aggravating when they do stuff like that, if it's not broke don't fix it.
Legitimate? Not sure, can't find the source code anywhere. Up to date? Hell no, last update was 2016-10-06 Why not use [some more up-to-date decompiler](https://github.com/rocky/python-uncompyle6/), source is right there on github, so everyone can see if it's "legitimate".
Python good javascript bad
For now I am just going to hardcode. I cannot figure out how to have it display as a table.
My motivation is my disgust for inefficiency. Doing x. Takes forever. Fuck, a lot of this can be automated. But who cares, too much work. Doing x again. Fuck. Doing x again. FAAAKKK. Doing x again. Okay, fuck this. No work will be done until I automate this piece of shit.
Luckily my github is really robust imo [you can see here](https://github.com/M4cs) Ive already got a job so I think my resume is starting to build out. I know there are a lot of certs for security so i was interested in like python proficiency certifications. thanks for the info tho! great for anybody whod want to go into IT or SysAdmin work
It would help greatly if you posted the output of the error/screenshot.
Yup, you’re right on both. For OOP, that’s why I said common patterns, not availability. I don’t think JS projects use true OOP often, but I may be wrong. And ah, I didn’t know about JS’s JIT compilation! Thanks for the info.

But when you have to use Android Studio, Visual Studio Code or Eclipse, it is quite hard to start as it often takes more than a minute to open the project. Give me something I can do with vim and it'll be open before I've thought about where to start.
Or C#, given the amount of Xamarin and Unity apps.
Open Python documentation and read about `multiprocessing`

Looks good! Definitely shows an interesting duality between recursive and iterative algorithms. Although I guess in this case, it shows a BFS algorithm used instead of a recursive algorithm? Out of curiosity, have you benchmarked a recursive solution vs your solution?
Still working on that one
I listen to certain albums that get me in the zone. One of my favorites since college is In Rainbows by Radiohead. That first track never fails to get me down to work.
This hurts
Step 5. Profit???
Keep working mate.good luck
They are very different semantically. A dataclass has a certain number of well defined, typed fields, and represents a single entity. A dictionary is a mapping of keys to values.
You use them differently. Dataclasses are like \`Structs\` in other languages. You can also think of them as more flexible, mutable \`NamedTuples\`, or classes set up with builtin constructors, formatters etc.
Not totally following, what do you mean by "well defined"
I mean that you know in advance what the field names and types are.
Thank you
I'm exactly the same. Once you have "solved" it then executing the rest of it seems a bit boring, doesn't it?
Why is it slower to start with VSCode? `cd myProject &amp;&amp; . code` &gt; start coding.
Have you thought about making a python library to do the same as your custom scripting language? Also good work dude!
The way its written, `points` should be a list.
Thanks! I haven't thought about this, it might be a good idea.
You can imagine the keys as non-continuous, or as "A", "B", "C" etc.

I'm sure it would make a nice little addition. You could possibly make bindings for your renderer if you haven't already, who knows what people could use it for.

Its a way to compartmentalize data and logic so that the code is more modular and less monolithic compared to just having a bunch of subroutines. that operate on globals.

Having built and maintained Java to c++ bindings through the ndk, I can say that... No... No one should ever be required to touch that awful, awful library. I feel that they implemented it in few hours, said that's good enough, and then quit.
He will build it last Thursday.
I can imagine indeed.
You wrote your own functions to convert from radians to degrees and vice versa but still imported the math module. You can jus use math.radians and math.degrees.
I don't have much experience with python on windows, but you could look for the file libvlc.dll and put it in the same folder as exe. Perhaps the libvlc file will be in vlc install folder.
Very epic, I could have never thought of doing something like that
For me, the daunting part of embarking on a project is the scope: realizing that anything of consequence requires a lot of moving parts. The compounding factor is the need to feel proficient, that my time is well-spent on projects that *generally* succeed. And my solution is to not look at it like that. Not at all. (1) Choose a task. Make it simple - *really* simple - the simplest thing that might be useful in a bigger project later. Could be: "How do I talk to a webserver?", or: "How do I make scripts running on two computers talk to each other?", or: "How do I display a screen or window of graphics?" (2) Set aside some time with zero expectations. All you're going to do is sit in front of a computer, and read, and type. The End. The goal is to learn and experiment, not to accomplish anything of substance. (3) During your block of time, focus on that one little thing. Read the "Hello, World" examples of that task. Understand how they work. Play around with some minor variations; see where it takes you. Identify what you *don't* understand - which parts of the platform seem like magic, or seem superfluous and unnecessary - and just file it away for later. (4) Keep a journal of your experience. This step is **very** important. Use your favorite text editor and describe what you've learned, what works, what doesn't, what you don't understand, what you find interesting. Anything. About 20% of the purpose of this step is to commemorate stuff for future reference (for example: "what was the problem with this platform, again?") The other 80% is structuring your thought process. I've frequently had the experience of trying to write up what I didn't understand, and then realizing the solution *in the course of writing it up*. (5) Extend. You could write wrappers around the code you've written to provide general-purpose stuff that works for you. You could tack on another piece of the project that makes use of your work this session. You could use your new appreciation (and confidence) for this technical field as the basis for further study. Etc. That's really it. The goal here is to get moving in a way that *may* be useful later, even if you have no idea of what to do with it now.
Right okay, that makes sense.
Why? What advantages does the ``src`` give you for bigger projects vs smaller ones?
Use Python virtual environments?

You've implemented a [backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking) solution. Backtracking in general is basically recursive, however you have implemented the recursion in the form of a stack or LIFO queue of candidates (`todo`). In a conventional recursive solution, the same data items would be preserved in the same order, but as local variables of pending functions on the function-call-stack. I agree this is somewhat clearer. It would be easier to debug also, because if there is a problem you can display the `todo` contents, where in a recursive-call solution it is hard to display the pending results since they are on the execution stack mixed in with return addresses and stuff.
Looks pretty cool 😄
I'm a beginner. Just finished a Coursera course which introduces basic python commands, which can be found in this [link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-programming-introduction). After that, with the basic information that I know. I managed to create my own Hangman game. This week, I'm working on my version of a CLI-based TicTacToe.
Or just using multithreading and expecting it to work.
Cool. Thanks! Yeah I guess you could prepend it but it's nice to finish candidates you've already started, so if you have a much more complex solution you get some answers written to file, say, while the function is running, rather than wait for everything to hit the penultimate step before producing your first solution.
Yeah I mean a lot of abstract data-structure problems that people seem to ask in interviews are kind of pointless. See: The knight dialer problem, the recursive staircase problem, etc.
This looks awesome! But what software are you using to open the animations? My computer open the default gnome image viewer and shows me a still of the last frame created.
Whut?
True
Thanks for the info! I'm just dabbling in Python and writing scripts only occasionally. 8\] But soon I will take some time to learn the language more properly!! Thanks again!
This may not seem like much, but this it is a big deal to me. It is the first big project that I have ever done outside simple print statements and calculators. You can get it on my github if you want: [https://github.com/keystroke3/redpaper](https://github.com/keystroke3/redpaper)
Strategy 1. Watch woodworkers, mechanics, makers build stuff on youtube. Get pumped, wanting to build something too. Get to work. Strategy 2. Make a to do list of all the stuff that's lingering and waiting to be done. Pick the item that is least unpleasant, even if it's not top priority. Getting *something* done is better than not getting anything done.
You just need a requirements.txt. You can list a full url to a package instead of just a package name to install those prebuilt wheels or a package from github. You don't seem to know the difference between pip and pypi. Pip installs packages from pypi by default. Nothing comes "from pip". You can also mirror a copy of every package you have installed into a local directory and tell pip to install only from there.
Write code to handle small problems when you’re bored. Earlier I noticed I had 10 irrelevant screenshots on my desktop. I proceeded to spend 10 mins writing a script that deleted them rather than spending 3 secs doing it manually.
Thrse should not take a minute to open. If you don't have a SSD, get one ASAP. If you have less than 16GB RAM, upgrade RAM.
LMAO repo didn't last long before it got shut down. What makes me laugh about it is the app doesn't even really show the real tits, you kids should try it on your own wife or girlfriend before you start getting your virgin dicks all hard. &amp;#x200B; Saddens me that the repo was shut down because I had made a similar comment about this as well. Open Source and apparently none of the people who are using it have no idea how it works other then going by what others have said. &amp;#x200B; Get off /b/ for a for years focus on getting a girlfriend and then try to use this app on your own girlfriend. Because I did and the tits that where put on my girlfriend are not even remotely close, the nipples aren't even anywhere near close. &amp;#x200B; Also the repo said it generates a fake nude in replacement. &amp;#x200B; Moral of the story is this app only helps aid you virgins into your fantasy of women you will never be with.
&gt;I'm curious what word you'd use for assignment. `whichis`

Or let the Point be the dictionary key, and the value be some metadata about that point (Presumably monsters and loot and trap doors). Really good for sparse dataset.

I don't need to change hardware to edit text files.
Because vscode/eclipse/androidstudio requires GB of RAM. vim doesn't. vim only has to load at most 4MB into memory, which is often cached between loads. IDE should not mean that it integrates EVERYTHING, it should only integrate what is required to assist.

I think youretalijg about the difference between 1 second and 3 or 4. Harlmdly going to hinder someone from coding.
Depends on how badly you need an excuse to procrastinate.
That's a great idea! Let's be retarded on purpose! Let's make shitty shows on purpose because that's so much better!
Certainly. Was just trying to help.
what did you use for the scraping, downloading, and accessing your wallpaper settings?
First off all, awesome stuff! Second, which distro is that?
Interested in a little collaboration? This would be useful on other platforms as well
I used PRAW to get post attributes, and requests to download. For settings I used configparser.
What OS are you using? Congrats on finishing your tool and sharing it with us as well :)
Very impressive! I was wondering how much experience you have had in programming?
multiline comments on python sometimes work: ''' LEL LEL2 ''' &amp;#x200B; but blablabla sometimes not. Anyway, "multiline comments" are done by selecting a block of text and doing ctrl+shift+/ in vscode. I think most editors have this option... I agree with you in principle though. Trying to jam one language as the fix-all for all problems will only cause you pain... more pain than just learning the other language, something often lost on people starting out.
This is a project I had been working on for about 3 or 4 months now. I used to commit at least one thing a day to git and finally got it ready got the world. In that time, I have learned so much about python. It is still a bit buggy, but now that it is out in the wild, I will now have motivation to make it better.
That would be awesome!! I don't have a good grip on other platforms especially MacOS. My one major rule is that you adhere to PEP8.
Thanks! When I started making this (like, a month ago), I had about one other month of making discord bots in Python. Before that, I had little knowledge of C#. That was basically the beginning for me in programming in general.
Thanks. I am running Manjaro Gnome.

cool man. I think it's a legit cool project and I might try to make something similar. Not necessarily with wallpapers, but I like the idea of searching something, having some script scrape the internet for that thing, and then downloading it onto your computer.
[**f.read**](https://f.read)**()** will read text starting from the reading pointer, which is initially zero(Points to the beginning of the file). After you read the file, the reading pointer will be set to the end of the file, so you will have to reset it with **f.seek(0)** in order to read file content again. Or you can read file content into a variable, which is more efficient.
Hello everyone! For my project, I am attempting to fill in the patches of the all-sky map based on a defined color mapping. However, I am unable to pass upper and lower latitude and longitude limits to define each patch...or at least unable to pass limits that are of the same dimensions as my color mapping. Does anyone have any ideas on how I may remedy this?
/r/learnpython, read the sidebar, and format your code so we can read it: add 4 spaces in front of each line of code.
Gotta compile the GUI
this wouldn't work windows tho. minor suggestion have a condition the check system platform and does correct methods for that system
sorry, my bad, on it
Hey guys! For my project, I need to fill in patches based on a defined color map. I thought I could pass upper and lower latitude and longitude limits with the argument of the color map, but dimensions are incorrect. For example, I collected 6 patches and their color map values for l=0:180 (30 degree increments) and b=0:45 (constant) However, since each x and y (l and b) have the two limits associated with them, my color map has half the elements as my x and y arguments. Does anyone have any ideas on a remedy?
Hmm that's a good question. I went ahead and implemented both algorithm strategies for the 'knight dialer' problem, and got actually comparable results, but I am running some ML stuff I didn't want to pause though. Here's the two algorithms I used. I don't know about RAM usage though and in particular how it scales with different types of recursive problems (in particular for high-branching problems where RAM may become more important than CPU). ``` knight_moves = [[4,6],[6,8],[9,7],[4,8],[3,9,0],[],[1,7,0],[2,6],[1,3],[2,4]] trec = [] tbac = [] for j in range(2,14): t = time.time() todo=[[1],[2],[3],[4],[6],[7],[8],[9]] done=[] def dial(the_list): ret_list = [] for i in knight_moves[the_list[-1]]: if len(the_list) == j: done.append(''.join([str(i) for i in the_list + [i]])) else: ret_list.append(dial(the_list + [i])) return ret_list [dial(i) for i in todo] t = time.time()-t trec.append(t) del todo, done, t t = time.time() todo=[[1],[2],[3],[4],[6],[7],[8],[9]] done=[] while len(todo)&gt;0: workon = todo.pop() for move in knight_moves[workon[-1]]: full_list = [*workon,move] if len(workon)==j: done.append(''.join([str(i) for i in full_list])) else: todo.append(full_list) t = time.time()-t tbac.append(t) del todo, done, workon, full_list, t plt.figure() plt.plot(np.log(trec[2:]),label='recursive') plt.plot(np.log(tbac[2:]),label='backtrack') plt.legend() plt.show() ```
Using vs code? Install the autopep8 addon. Just discovered it today
and bugs will get noticed a lot faster... nothing like releasing to drive them all out into the light!
How do you set the wallpaper? I'm currently using KDE but i3 as my window manager, so I need to use feh to set the bg.

how do i read cfile content onto a variable??
Ignoring efficiency. Can this be done with just regex? `[H|He|Li|Be...]*`
It does not work on any non Linux platform at the moment. I just wanted to get it up and running and add more features later.
I use it, but it is not that reliable. I just rely on the syntactic highlighting by the pep8 linter. By nowI have grown accustomed to it.
Let's say you have a class and an instance: class Dog(): def __init__(self): self.x = 5; self.y = 10 dog = Dog() You can access the members of the class in an object-oriented manner: dog.x # 5 But you can also access them as a dictionary, via the builtin `__dict__` object member: dog.__dict__ # {'x': 5, 'y': 10} You can use the dictionary to access members by name: dog.__dict__['x'] # 5 dog.__dict__['z'] = 8 # dog.z is now 8 But you don't have to go through `__dict__` every time, because Python has some builtin functions to work with classes with nicer syntax: getattr(dog, 'x') # 5 setattr(dog, 'q', 7) # dog.q is now 7 hasattr(dog, 'q') # true So what's the point of classes instead of just dictionaries? Because in addition to the syntactic niceties, you get all of the other stuff you'd ordinarily get from object-oriented programming. For example: (1) You can import all of the functionality of the `Dog` class in another script: from DogCodeFile import Dog (2) You can perform type inference: type(dog) is Dog # true dog2 = globals()['Dog']() # calls dog2.__init__() You can't do that with a generic dictionary. You'd have to hack in some kind of typing system, which requires more effort and results in clumsier code. (3) You can subclass `Dog` to add special kinds of behaviors for individual breeds of `Dog`. (4) You can use `Dog` as an abstract interface with a set of implementations. (5) You can create class instances of `Dog` to permit a property to be shared among every instance of `Dog`. ...etc. In other words - classes in Python offer many of the same functionality and possibilities of classes in strongly typed languages: encapsulation, abstraction, hierarchical type organization, etc. (However, Python's duck-typing system is not as robust as strongly typed languages. Syntax checking is not possible, nor is security: Python does not have a `private` keyword. YMMV. Personally, I love the rapid prototyping advantages of Python's weak type system.)

I don't know what feh is, but if you loom at the Wiki on the github repo, you will see there is a command `redpaper -c` to change the wallpaper. You could create a keyboard shortcut for it.
This is for anyone who wants a fresh look on their desktop every so often. They may not have time to search for and download new wallpapers. Whith this tool, you can just type one command and it does that for you.

You should work on your coding style. There is a lot of repeated lines in your program.

Reddit r/wallpapers and r/wallpaper
Multiline strings are not multiline comments and reverting to tools as workarounds for a construct which would be a 30 minutes job on the language implementors simply is wrong. This is as idiotic as javas decades long absolute ignorance regarding class properties and javascripts 3 null like values (null, undefined and NaN). But I guess every language has its idiotic features where the language implementors simply stubbornly ignore the requests for it to to clean it up.
For users on Mac there is also an app which I find cool. It uses different subreddits for the sources and I like the ones from r/earthporn a lot. Link: Wallpaperer for Reddit https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/wallpaperer-for-reddit/id1102248738?l=en&amp;mt=12

If you are on windows you can use ctypes: ctypes.windll.user32.SystemParametersInfoW(20, 0, save\_path , 0) If you are in Linux you can use os.system("/usr/bin/gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri "+ save\_path) &amp;#x200B; with save\_path being the path to the figure.
You might want to look into making a pip package out of it so installation is simply one line :)

+3. 1 isn't good enough for how sweet Black is. It also has a pytest plugin as well as cell magic for `.ipynb`.
That all makes sense, and I'm sure most of it applies, but I was sepcifically asking about "dataclasses" , even if you can inherit from a dataclass , I'm not sure it's that useful. Built in functions though, that I get.

Okay, but your post started: &gt; I read/heard python classes are built on top of a dictionary ...which suggests a generic question about Python classes. the answer to your more specific question is [here](https://realpython.com/python-data-classes/).
Tested on sites like Amazon, Ebay, AriaPC, Facebook Marketplace etc. So long as you provide the tag/class for each element, it will usually grab those without much effort. TBH, could be re-purposed to grab anything you want lol.
That's fair. Oh, that covers it. Thanks :)

Hey, nice project! I did something pretty similar a while back: [https://github.com/TGlide/Reddit-WallLoad](https://github.com/TGlide/Reddit-WallLoad) if you want to take a look! I started implementing a interface for it, where you could visualize the wallpapers, but never got to properly finish it. Anyways, that's an awesome first project, guarantee you the first of many.
Hack == Guessing urls?
The os.walk function visits every subdirectory which makes your recursive call redundant.
So no, my friend, the lines you identified as wrong weren't wrong. The attempt to make it recursive was wrong, as os.walk() covers all subfolders already. The extra call resulted in the duplicate list entry. But I must say, knowing what os.walk() does now doesn't really help me understand it.
What’re you specifically looking for? If it’s layouts and stuff you can “pip install pyqt5-tools” and open qtdesigner to make layouts. The use the qt conversion to turn it all into code. If it’s other than layouts like using elements and whatnot then google searching will be the best way. Most tutorials just cover basics, stack overflow will have the more advanced questions.

Two small tips: You could ditch out PRAW if you use the reddit API directly i.e. `https://www.reddit.com/r/earthporn+spaceporn/top.json?t=day&amp;limit=10` Also don't forget to add `__pycache__` to your `.gitignore` (you can remove it afterwords via `git rm -r __pycache__`)
How long have you known python for?
Wow! So mate what functionality did you use like library. Could you link me your GitHub?
My workflow is reverse of that, I think of something I need and then learn how to code it!
Nice! I made a reddit crawler a few months back. It runs daily. I should make it so my wallpaper folder only contains images from like the last week.
&gt;right out of the box and with a few easily installed plugins Pick one.
A few more details * uses my [libxmplite](https://pypi.org/project/libxmplite/) library to decode the modules (it wraps libxmp-lite c-library) * uses my [miniaudio](https://pypi.org/project/miniaudio/) library for playback and streaming (it wraps the miniaudio c-library) * just a Tkinter GUI It was an interesting journey; while making this I learned a lot about how Python CFFI works and how it can simplify making C extension modules. Also the miniaudio and libxmp-lite APIs are great to work with only the callbacks into Python code gave me some troubles.
thank you so much
thank you so much
hmmm ok thank so much.
What icons are those, and what's the theme??? Super nice
I'm mostly having trouble on interacting with the python file created from qtdesigner. I'm confused on how to edit what's in qtdesigner on another file where I actually write the code. Sorry if this doesn't make any sense. Basically, if I create something in qtdesigner and then convert that to a .py file I'm not sure how I would edit it in another file.
[Here's the github repository](https://github.com/BarneyKB/PCPartPicker-Ebay-Price-Checker) &amp;#x200B; I made this mostly for fun but it is actually pretty useful and somewhat reliable (storage isn't that reliable, but it's ok). The github repository has the source as well as the EXE which I made using pyinstaller, so you don't need python to run it.
Don't learn libraries. Learn how to program and learn your problem domain.

Nice, do you guess the word in the hangman game or does it guess yours?
Cool idea! Would you enter the files manually into the program or like point it to a directory and it finds all connections?
wow that looks awesome! does it just float above all applications or is it on the desktop?
I think our hearts are in the same place... you learn best by practicing on something practical you need.
I mean, the xkcd algorithm is a good way to generate a password, but I use about 100 different services that I have to log into regularly, and I straight up could not remember 100 different "easy" passwords. At which point, my options are either: 1. tie the password generation algorithm to the name of the service, which greatly reduces entropy 2. reuse passwords, which is a total non-starter 3. admit that I'm bad at remembering passwords and use as password manager.

Chiming in here a bit late, but just wanted to relate my experience with this... A few weeks ago my 6yo daughter came home from school and showed me a computer game she'd designed - drawn on paper complete with keyboard and monitor, the main character was a bird which flew around dodging clouds that drifted past. I asked if she would be interested in making this game on a real computer and she was excited by the prospect. Coincidentally this blog post came up in my feed about the same time. The idea of teaching programming by actually writing real code, as opposed to gamified graphical environments like scratch jr really resonated with me. So this last weekend I set her up with my old laptop installed with pygame zero and mu editor, and off we went. Have to say the experience has been really great, echoing pretty much everything you have related in your blog post. We've gone through small iterations of the game learning and reinforcing concepts at every step. She's been genuinely excited by being able to see and interact with the changes she makes in the code, and the thrill of being able to make her idea a real thing is very motivating for her. As bonus she's learning good general computing skills like files, folders, opening, saving etc. Pygame zero with mu editor is a perfect level of abstraction. There's no unnecessary boilerplate, and we were able to go from zero to moving a bird around the screen with the keyboard with surprising ease, learning heaps along the way. So great job /u/lordmauve \- pygame zero is a great learning tool!
The library is old, and a little rough around the edges. I don't know why it never took off or got better supported. It has new maintainers now, and development seems to be picking up a bit. Rpyc lets you create a python object and access it from another python program.
YouTube. Not being a dick, serious.
If it's kept as a linked list the only thing you need to keep track of (relative to this) is the first pointer.
Be sure to read https://www.chess.com/robots.txt first
Thanks a lot for fixing it. Your project is an inspiration for people like myself who are stepping into the world of programming :)
&gt; i'm getting the feeling that a Python list use the [source](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/5c22476c01622f11b7745ee693f8b296a9d6a761/Include/listobject.h#L22), luke.
Sure couldn’t hurt, especially with supporting documentation.
a and b are *names* for the same object. In other languages (like C) a variable is the *address* of some memory. The Python list object contains pointers or references to the objects stored in the list. As the list expands, the names a and b continue to reference the same list object.
Is it accurate?
Yup, pretty much.
Uh I'm not actually sure i have spent the past few days building it i haven't had time to buy some stock but I am planning to, so i can test it out this coming monday. it says it is using an sklearn module but im not sure.
/r/ImaginaryLandscapes /r/ImaginaryMindscapes Thank me later
Probably don't have to buy shares to test it.
If I could ask, what Linux distro are you using. The theme looks great.
eh ive always wanted to buy stock and this is better than just randomly buying and selling so whatever.
Cool. Let me know how it goes. Good luck!
Thanks!
Can you also make a tutorial on how to make one like this.
Nice Project Dude, I just noticed something maybe i am wrong. But in the procedure it says git clone https://github.com/keystroke3/redpaper.git &amp;&amp; cd redpaper &amp;&amp; sudo sh install.sh But there is no install.sh script, there is one for installer.sh, are they different?
I had been using this for months to solve a corner case issue with a remote server, and then the latest update broke it. "New maintainers" is not always a good thing.
There will be an adjustment period for sure, but at least people can actually improve it now.

What operating system is this? Looks like linux, but i don't know what flavor..
Yep
Same. Good luck to you, friend!
The proper way to do this would be to use `heapq`. However as a beginner it's probably better just to add a `sort()` call after every append. self._graph_dict[start].append(end) self._graph_dict[start].sort() Ask in /r/learnpython next time.
This is awesome! A couple of days ago, I was looking for a tool to do just this. Would you be open to collaboration? I would love to help make this awesome project even better!
Which OS is this?
Yulp
I'll look into that, thanks!
Hey, Let's throttle the FPS with multi thread and CUDA next. If you do that, I don't think you will ever feel the need to go to college! Let me know how this goes!
&gt; Python list is always allocated on a contiguous region in memory -- is this correct ? From python's point of view, yes. However it requests that memory from the OS, which may or may not map to a contiguous region in hardware. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_address_space &gt; then sometime this list needs to be moved, and variable B needs to point to the new location. No, the b points to the location of the list object. That object keeps an internal pointer to the data array. When it's time to upsize / downsize the array the list object handles the memory allocation, copying, memory release and of course updating the internal pointer.
I guess the word
Yup

No, its not guessing urls. I just looked at how the urls are build and created the script to make all the other urls
That's a neat idea... Thank you!
I am! Just kind of asking around hoping for some help. Biology/chemistry is more my thing then computer science but I know enough to be dangerous.
Actually, learning bad patterns can be worse than randomness. For example, depending how your model learns it might predict to buy at the top of a bubble because the slope suggests price will increase another 10x. i.e. A poor model might buy high and sell low.
&gt; Too much work to convince the compiler I know what I am doing Thanks, this has been my experience recently as well jumping back into Java. We're migrating our small code base to Kotlin and that seems slightly better, but definitely missing Python.
really? my mistake then. was my model good do you think?
Ibam open for collabs.

Why not use a built in solution? Using sort() will solve this in one line
sorry, let me correct that. I changed the name of the file to installer.sh. You can replace the name in the command. I will set it up now.
This function will sort the array. a.sort(reverse=True)
Just checked, it is called Github Student Developer Pack, [link](https://education.github.com/pack)
I was learning how to code in python. This thing took me ages anI was nit taking notes, so that may be hard. Plus, some of the processes I used are not as efficient as I would like.
Manjaro Gnome
what do you mean "had it"? What problems are you having?
In C++ terms, a Python list is basically just a `vector&lt;PyObject_t*&gt;`, which is how everyone, even Lisp implementations, implement their "list" or "growable array" or whatever types. No one uses linked lists for anything, ever, because of their horrifying cache locality.
a.sort(reverse) for i in a: print (i)
Single day pet project. It is not perfect, I have to manually execute it after every four rows - since the scrolling part is a bit sketchy. My estimate is that I am not saving much time due to this, because I had to invest time to learn how to do this and to come up with an approach.

About a year now. But I seriously started learning it at the beginning of this year.
thanks a lot for the quick answers. I just want to learn algorithms, so I cannot use built in function 'sort'. Who can explain whats the problem with using 'if'? I will appreciate it very much
Dude, that was beautiful! I've always loved mod files, and this took my back to the good old octamed days! Thankyou for sharing!
And since you don't need to compile or anything, please don't forget to leave it in production working copy without a commit so the next deploy will flush away the beautiful workaround and nobody knows what happened!
Try printing out at each step and see what hapoens
Well, iv'e never needed multiline comments myself(always used ctrl+alt+/) so that's why i haven't found it so important. They could add something like: c''' long comment''' i guess... however i don't see that as a huge reason not to use a programming language/scripting language xD
 if not len(args) == 0: you can just write this as if args:
One small suggestion — you can probably find a better way to initialize the year selector that doesn’t require you to manually enumerate them.
The problem with 'if' is nothing but the amount of code. You will have to use a for loop here and write a conditional that takes each list item, compares it to every other list item and aligns it accordingly in a newly made list. Which is okay. But why would you do that in Python?
The opposite is generally true due to a fixed cache size. 64-bit offers more RAM. That said, there is not really a good reason to use 32-bit Python. Python isn't a fast language anyways, so it's not a huge deal. You'll fight memory issues that can just go away.
Yes, you are right.
Weil i hear the same argument on the java side regarding class properties and setters and getters. It is always a matter of not being used to it and rely on tool and language hacks to simulate it to get it back in.
No we didn't. He took a break for a while and he's back. He was the #1 vote getter on the steering council. He's just not the BDFL anymore.
You need to wrap the byte stream with a character stream object that specifies the source character encoding. That said, I’d advise just sending everything as binary. Mutating data in transmission is weird, character encoding can be tricky, and there are few benefits.
For an entry level like me it would mean a lot
Sorry this will get long: Well I have been doing java from version 0.8 way up to the latest versions. But my work revolves around in many other languages. Is java inelegant, to some degree yes, if you count inelegance by the LOCs it produces. Part of this is caused by the lack of class properties, which causes java to plaster your code with pointless setters and getters which should not have been there in the first place. Is it inelegant from a maintainability POV definitely no, but probably yes/no in its latest incarnations. Part of the beauty of java was tightness in the language which caused that the code instantly was readable by others. This however made the programs more verbose than necessary because in its original form there were no code shortcuts. Scala for instance which claims to have a small language core offloaded many language constructs into library constructs which seem like core language constructs and its myriads of language extensions and shortcuts causes a problem programmed by 10 different people to look entirely different at least 8 times and probably is unmaintainable by 4 people. A java program programmed usually has the maintainability of 9.9 people out of 10 (I am not counting python in here because I would not touch it for a bigger project although I like it for small to medium sized one man projects) Java now added a lot of functional constructs. This made the code more concise especially in the loop and collections area, but with the downgrade of post program maintainability (to some degree in other areas it actually improves the code like event handling and removal of inner classes). Whoever had to debug out a huge functional chain which processes a collection of elements and even worse maybe parallely knows what I am saying. What makes java compelling for really big projects is its wealth of really hardened enterprise libraries and face it its type safety (I know this is a python forum and I probably will get a lot of disagreement on this) and the inherent advantages of its vm in many domains. Type safety is cumbersome and makes small programs way bigger than in untyped languages (a domain where I am atm 90% of my time nopwadays) but it adds a huge safety net on top of unit tests you should not underestimate. Especially in exposed interfaces/methods enforcing type safety is almost a must to avoid unwanted sideffects. In my experience once a program becomes bigger there is a certain threshold where a typesafe language scales almost linearily while a non typed language then suddenly reduces productivity exponentially. Before that the untyped language is faster to develop for. Unit tests only shift that barrier but do not avoid it. In my personal experience the best is to have a combination of type safety and untyped language features to get the best of both world, where untyped should only be allowed if possible on intra function/method level and must be explicitely declared while typesafety should be enforced on api level. To sum everything up, at least we do not have to deal with C/C++ anymore for normal applications, thank god.
Don't have an answer, but TIL about LSPs. Thank you
This is really great but would you mind sharing the theme name with us it's really good. icons are papirus btw.
PRAW is more intuitive to use. I have since removed __pycache__

That is still in the pipe line

Oh, I thought it was a program. I just look for a problem that can be solved with software and start creating a program. I then look for study materials on particular topics I am having trouble with. https://realpython.com has been of great help to me.
Applications is Layan-dark, icons is Nebula. The dock is Plank with transparency theme.
I will see if I can, but I can't promise you anything
Thanks.
Well, there were issues with the print statement, that were solved by making it a function... I just think they should have kept the statement too, called it depreciated, have pylint complain about it, etc - then perhaps fully remove in py4 (or never :) )

Well every extension is two clicks away and having it preinstalled would needlessly bloat the main software for anyone not developing in python.
LSP is amazing, I can't believe I'm just getting to know it this week! The thing that excites me most is that I could potentially make Emacs / vim as powerful modern IDEs/editors like VSCode (not that there's something wrong with them)!
simple as that. Thank you. Heapq means heap and queue?
I am a learner but what are your tips on making the GUI, I am good with background but without a GUI everything is on the command line, I don't like it but when I try to make a GUI I struggle for hours. I tried to learn but what videos talk about is limited. Also I used kivy but it is a bit complicated
At the moment it is just running in the Terminal like htop, but it would be possible to make it a desktop widget with the Python GI library. Could possibly work on that and is a nice idea to implement!
Good idea
Oh cool. Is the picture you attached a transparent terminal then or something?
Hi, this is great. I have been able to download msft, but how to load the file to make the predictions? Can you advise?
That wallpaper is really nice. Could you post the link for download?
Yes, it's just my ZSH terminal with pretty high transparency. Maybe I can use the screenlets library to make it like a desktop widget. I think that would be the easiest way to have it always working I nthe background
Yes, it's just my ZSH terminal with pretty high transparency. Maybe I can use the screenlets library to make it like a desktop widget. I think that would be the easiest way to have it always working I nthe background.
I usually handle stuff like this by putting it into a seperate .key file and putting that into git ignore - prevents you from ever making data like that public
The problem isn't the `if`. The first time around, `i` is 0. So when you compare `a[i]` to `a[i-1]`, you're comparing `a[0]` (the first item) to `a[-1]` (the last item).
I seriously don't have tips. I wanted a gui, but did not feel like learning a GUI framework. I also did not want to start working on gui because it would have taken me more months to release the project. So I settled on TUI which is close enough. I used many if statements and f-strings to create the TUI. The only advice I can give, is to envision the user using the program without programming knowledge. Think of how they would interact with the program and slowly build up a picture of what the GUI should look like. Draw of you have to. After that, it is intergrating the front with the back.

Tried your script. If image size is greater than maxsize it becomes smaller in file size, but when image size is smaller it becomes a few KB larger in file size. And what was your resuts?
I had that when I was still learning PRAW and OAuth2. It soon became redundant and I removed it when it was mentioned here.
Great work. Haven't tested the app yet, looking forward to have it on my system - thought about that it would be so cool if my distro has some feature like this just yesterday!
Source code...please
A dataclass is a class specifically designed to store a related set of data, i.e., a record, like a namedtuple but it can be mutable. Its main advantage is that you don't have to define a \_\_init\_\_ method to initialize all the fields, instead the field names, types, and possible initial values are defined as though they were class attributes. Instead of: class Point: def \_\_init\_\_(x: float = 0, y: float = 0) -&gt; None: self.x: float = x self.y: float = y &amp;#x200B; you can define a dataclass: @dataclass class Point: x: float = 0 y: float = 0 &amp;#x200B; pointa = Point(1.0, 2.0) &amp;#x200B; Just like ordinary class, dataclasses can have methods defined on them. And you may want to define \_\_slots\_\_ in the dataclass definition since your fields will probably never change. &amp;#x200B; Also, you can still have class attributes defined if needed, just use the annotation typing.ClassVar.
Neato
Looks cool as always. Keep up the good work.
All the client ID's you have ever put will be in the git history BTW. So if you want to remove it better change and get a new one too. :)
fastAPI along with asyncpg. fastAPI has awesome documentation.
This is cool good work. What did you use to colour stuff in terminal? ANSI or some library? How did you create the ascii art redpaper?
Motivation rarely appears out of nowhere. If you just start, the motivation usually follows. Having a daily routine to code even 10 minutes helps. Often you go way longer than that too. One thing that may decrease motivation is simply not knowing what to do. Every time you get an idea for a program, write it down and write a step-by-step guideline for it. When you start coding, just pick a project and one small task to work on. The more you code, the better you can plan these projects and tasks. It's all about habits really and having interesting projects to work on.
Must admit I only used Java since version 1.1, so you beat me there. Regarding "the beauty of java was tightness in the language which caused that the code instantly was readable by others" this was kind of true around the time I first used it. You could learn the entire language and standard library in a short time, and it was a small simple language without any tricky syntax to confuse a reader. I can see how many (including me) flocked to it from languages like C++ that were so much more complex. I even knew most things there was to know about how the JVM worked. If Java had been in 1998 what it is now I am not sure if it would ever have been successful being introduced in schools as an introductory language? And the main selling point for Java these days really is that it is easy to find cheap programmers that can use it (to some degree). I have definitely gone back to use C++ more. Recent versions have some very nice features (smart pointers and type deduction in particular) and Java is not that small, simple alternative anymore. If I want something high-level there is Python. If I want something high-level running on a JVM there is Clojure. If I want low-level there is C or C++. I used to use Java all the time, but now I only use it for work when someone else decided I should use it, never because I personally would choose it. Disagree about unit tests though. Static types means almost nothing. They never catch any real errors. Seeing that I add two integers together will not detect that I was supposed to subtract them. If a line of code is not covered by tests there is no way of telling if it does what it is supposed to do, no matter what static type fans claim. The problem is not just that the static checks can not find anything useful, other than trivial things that the tests will find for you in an instant, or you can find manually in an instant as soon as you run the code. The problem is that in every real-world Java application I worked on the static typing means there is a huge amount of code written to make the compiler happy, and in all that code is where you will find bugs. Entire huge sub-systems full of factories and patterns and useless interfaces exists only to make the compiler happy, for shuffling trivial pieces of data from one place to another. If I could just have said "move this data from here to there" in a line or two there would be no place for bugs to hide. Instead there can be literally thousands of useless lines to do trivial things. And then the particular type of static class types used in Java often means that you get zero opportunities to re-use code, since there are no useful abstractions other than explicit interfaces. Code grows exponentially beyond what it would have to be because every interaction requires layers of very specific code. AND, to add insult to injury, I see more and more developers just rely on their IDE to auto-complete to whatever method happens to match the type signature of what they want to do. Looking at the documentation to understand what you do is a lost art, as long as whatever method you call takes the correct input parameters and have the correct return type. Never mind that there might be a difference calling x.add(y) instead of x.remove(y). Bugs, bugs, more bugs, and the static type checker says nothing, again. Yes, I am so tired of Java's static type checkers. :) Clojure also runs on the JVM, has much more concise syntax, optional static types (that is usually not needed because the built-in higher-level abstractions are just what is usually needed), can interop with any Java library, and is just better in every way.
What OS (I'm guessing it's a Linux distro) is that?
Okey
This should be in the standard library !
Nice going really like the idea
&gt; redpaper I recommend changing your shebangs. not everyone has the same path as you. its recommended to use `#!/usr/bin/env python3` over `#!/usr/bin/python3`
&gt;Yes, I am so tired of Java's static type checkers. :) Clojure also runs on the JVM, has much more concise syntax, optional static types (that is usually not needed because the built-in higher-level abstractions are just what is usually needed), can interop with any Java library, and is just better in every way. I cannot see myself to write any industrial grade project in a lisp derivate. Sorry but lisp derivates have a syntax which stands against them being used in really big projects ((((you)know)what)Imean) add on top of that enforced recursions etc... not sure if closure has loops as more readable looping constructs. &amp;#x200B; The only times I have encountered Lisp was in purely academical situations and where functional programming was taught. Well there is emacs, but thats about it and it has mostly stalled in its development progress. &amp;#x200B; Also I am not alone in my opinion regarding typed and untyped, I have talked to several developers coming to java from smalltalk and they were glad that they finally had enforced types on their interfaces, because with untyped inputs your last safetey net is the documentation -&gt; feed shit in get shit out and in the end you write the typechecks yourself. Thats the typical situation where suffenly a weird bug crawls up and is hard to track down because a corner condition of an expected parameter was not met and that happens in bigger projects with teams of programmers of varying experience way more often than it should, especially if you work on tight schedules (like always) having to meat deadlines on a byweekly base. &amp;#x200B; But I agree strong typing enforces a load of boilerplate code which is often not needed. Extreme patternities is a code sickness in itself and really is caused often by strong typing, but also often simply by programmers who want to push too many patterns on a micro scale. &amp;#x200B; Hence I personally think that the ideal combination is to give the user the option to go untyped like languages like typescript have and then strictly enforce types on api boundaries like methods functions etc...
Short and easy learning curve Quick and simple code implementation No need to complie In short easier to learn less code and easier execution all of which make one of the most popular for quick and dirty coding like scripts for example
This error usually happens because you are declaring a global variable and trying to use it inside your function without explicitly telling the variable is global. Your script is trying to create another local variable with three same name and assigning a value. To correct this, you can pass the "global" variable as parameter in your function def foo(extProc): # code here or explicitly say global extProc when declaring outside and will be treated as global variable. If my explanation is a bit confusing, here is a link to a question similar to yours with probably a better explanation https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10851906/python-3-unboundlocalerror-local-variable-referenced-before-assignment

Well maybe you can suggest it to them. With the addition of u'lel', f'lel' and so forth, why can't there be a c''' ''' or maybe just c' '? You seem far more knowledgable about languages than me and more passionate about this than me so maybe youll make some headway. You are right in that it could be useful. Guido seems reasonable to me(except not making python-compile [code.py](https://code.py)!!!111FD¤#%#%) if you make a good case, maybe he will listen or maybe there's other people at the wheel now.
The main argument for Python is its relatively quick uptake... you can go from zero to productive quicker in Python than either C# or Java, and you can do so across a wider spectrum of domains. Python has a very large standard library that makes it instantly applicable to a lot of different tasks, and it’s got _very_ large ecosystem of external modules that basically means “there’s a library for **that**” for almost any given value of **that**. But that’s not actually an argument from the language, so much as it’s an argument for the ecosystem around it. As would be arguing the merits of .net for C# or the JVM for Java. Purely considered as a language there’s not really that much that sets it apart from modern C# or Java... they’re all high level languages with a fairly heavy bent towards imperative, Object Oriented Programming, and so they share a lot of broadly similar ideas. Which makes sense; they serve similar spaces in a similar fashion, so they tend to cross-pollinate. I’d say, personally, that Python is much more readable than Java, especially, which has anObsessionToThePointOfLunacyForLongCamelCaseNames, but I know a lot of people that don’t like Python’s “simpler” grammar, so you’ll have to try reading and reasoning through some code examples to find your preference. For a first language any of them is a decent choice, with C# being the one I’d tend to go for if I leaning towards work in games, Java if I wanted to do mainly desktop application development, and Python for everything else.
Glad you liked it. Yeah, I like mods as well, and while making this I discovered I lost my collection of mods I thought I had kept from my Amiga days... :-(
Interessant artikel!
Good start, BUT, what if I want to backtrack? What if you want to add 100 rooms? I one started making a text based rpg/dungeon crawler. You should improve on this project further and further. That’s the best way of learning. I started with a 3 line program that put the first letter of a word at the end and added “pyg” after that. Now the program is a couple hundred lines long and does tons of stuff. If you keep working on this it could probably get great
How are you finding the book?
Well i have only dabbled in Python a little bit [https://github.com/werpu/input\_pipe](https://github.com/werpu/input_pipe) this is the project I did with it and basically I did it in Python because it had the best bindings outside of C to the Linux EVDEV api. Btw. I was quite amazed how well asyncio performed for my case. I will look it up if someone already suggested it, but I am sure someone did. Guido must have a good reason not to implement it. The implementation of multiline comments are normally straight forward and rather easy in an interpreter (you simply skip the parsing until the end of the comment when you build up your AST) My personal guess is a multiline comment breaks the block indentation patterns to some degree because you suddenly have something without an indentation which can go over multiple lines. But so do multiline strings. The usecase would be day to day editing. Single line comments are cumberson if you deal with already written comments you want to break apart into multiple lines.
If you really, really had to, you could drop [this one file into your project](https://github.com/erikrose/more-itertools/blob/master/more_itertools/recipes.py) and get about half of the tools... The marginal cost of depending on one little pure Python library with three .py files in it is pretty small. I wouldn't worry about it.
No need to worry about Clojure parenthesis, it tends to have fewer parenthesis than Java thanks to the various ways you can combine functions without nesting. Also the whole parenthesis scare is a bit silly as the main difference is to type **(f x y)** instead of **f(x, y)**. Plus, unlike many LISPs, Clojure use some other things like Python-like syntax for dicts and arrays, instead of using only parenthesis everywhere, so it looks a lot less strange. And it definitely has constructs to avoid looping. The entire thing with higher level functions is that you never have to explicitly use recursion the way you did back in school. Explicit loops are rare since most of the time you plug some function into some other function instead (the old map/filter/reduce, plus many more). But the loop constructs are also way superior to what you find in a language like Java, when you need them (much more like python list comprehensions). The thing about Clojure that I wish more other languages had is of course the immutable data types, that you know once you have some data it will remain exactly that and you can pass it around to other functions and other threads without worrying about anything changing behind your back. Much more useful to avoid bugs than to have the compiler try to check the types of things. Can really recommend trying Clojure and of course watching some of Rich Hickey's classic presentations, even if you end up not using the language much. Trying different languages is often useful just to get some new perspectives on how to do things. When I go back to do something in Java or Python now you can definitely see signs of Clojure in how I code (but I wish immutability could become the default in more high-level languages). I do agree about most of the other things you say though, except for the static typing.

[Exactly.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html)
Good point. 🤔
I keep running into this library and wanting to use it, but I never quite get the opportunity. What typically happens is that I have a few bits of my code that would be shorter if I used it - but they would be less clear to the reader and it doesn't quite fit. From a few days ago, I wanted to split a list, something that `more_itertools` does well. But here's my code: dash = argv.index('-') if '-' in argv else len(argv) argv, command = argv[:dash], argv[dash + 1 :] If I introduced `more_itertools`, I am introducing more work for the reader, because they have to then go and learn a bit of a library and read someone's documentation (and worry that it might not quite do what it says...) and I have to introduce a lambda into the mix: argv, command = more_itertools.split_at(argv, lambda x: x == '-') But wait, there's more. I'm slightly deceiving you:-D because in fact, the second code sample doesn't do exactly what the first does - if there is more than one `-`. Because the logic is hidden behind `split_at`, it blinds the eye to the fact there can be more than one split. (And I want only the first split, it's important!) So how to rectify it? Sadly, there doesn't seem a good way. `split_at` doesn't have a `maxsplit` parameter, so you have to do: argv, *rest = more_itertools.split_at(argv, lambda x: x == '-') command = list(itertools.chain.from_iterable(rest)) Or perhaps there's another function I missed. Either way, it's less work just to do it yourself. :-)
Unfortunately even after correcting those two lines it still gives me the unbound error. Not sure what I've missed
Thanks for the effort tho, cheers m8.

You’re using backslashes instead of forward slashes. Either preface the your file location with r (ie r’file\path\here’) or use double back slashes (‘file\\path\\here’)
Oh. I just copied the file address without changing the slashes. Got that. Thanks
I'm still learning. Currently I'm putting together a program that reads the APIs of explorers for different blockchains, as a way of practicing working with APIs. You tell it the addresses where you store your funds for different cryptos and how much monero you have, and it retrieves how much of each crypto you have, current market value, and maths out your portfolio for you. I think it's a great idea because Delta and blockfolio only work with exchange APIs and keeping all your crypto on exchanges isn't wise. This is something I'll actually use myself when it's done (part 2 is translating into Java for a mobile app).
Yes, that's the proper way to learn programming. Come up with a nice tool you could use, and then implement it.
This. Is. Awesome!
Good one
There was definitely a lot more I wanted to add to it, but didn't quite know how. Returning to this and improving it as I learn more features is a great idea. Thank you
I'm glad you like it.
Nice! Another option is esp8266 nodemcu boards and micropython, or even esphome :)
Let me also give a quick shoutout to Python’s data science libraries in particular. Pandas, Numpy and SciKitLearn are all incredible tools for data analysis.
They might as well be, as much as I care for them in 2019 :D
If I remember correctly all files became larger, but I might misremember and it only affected images smaller than max size yes.
That's far away of the best choice ! But I already had the sensor and the raspberry at home ;) So, an effective 0€ DIY !
Eh, they suck orthogonally to each other, I don't think there's a well-defined ordering for them.
You can. Probably some framework out there
Or ya know...actually just use http
Im interested. Note that im in Singapore so timings may be weird
There's a shorter way to do that by the way: import .db
Hey man he got pissed for a good reason thats for sure
The dot tells Python to search current directory first. You can also use two dots (..) to refer to the parent directory.
I've just finished adding user-requested features to my [wallpaper manager](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/azote) and I'm out of ideas. Could anyone submit an issue? ;)
You can test it using historical data. See if the predicted prices for any given day match the actual prices from later.
Yes, it's Pythonic and it's awesome!
Why you use a NoSQL database for structured data?
I can’t believe I’ve never seen it in 6+ years. Is it the same as saying: `form app import thing` if you are in a directory called app?
Check out the statsmodels library (https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/imputation.html)
right. i got that bit. it just seemed so “hacky” versus the usually explicit beauty of python.
Maybe I start with the idea which is growing in my mind for a while. A new python reverse shell working through the Telegram API.
Thanks for getting us rid of avbin! By the way: will it still work or do I have to update my current code?
The error message is being returned from the GL driver itself, so it's definitely not supporting GLSL 3.3. Perhaps the VMware GL support is not compete. That ised to be the case, so not sure if that has changed.
The structure of the data is so simple that it does not matter at all. MongoDB is easier to install and config than most SQL competitor.
I hope you meant algorithm book written using python. If so check this https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html
Thanks for the reply. I would love to only send binary, or not send using FTP at all. My job would be much easier, but in my situation I don't have a choice. I did get it working finally without having to save to the filesystem first. `if mode == 'ascii':` `ftp.storlines('STOR ' + file_name, src_file)` `else:` `file_stream = src_file.read()` `bytes_obj = BytesIO(file_stream)` `ftp.storbinary('STOR' + file_name, bytes_obj)`
It's mainly an alternative of doing: from.some.deep.level import foo It's useful in particular with packages. The modules in the package can find each other locally, and if you refactor and move the package somewhere else you don't need to change a bunch of imports.
Ty
The ffmpeg support is still new and untested, but AVbin was unmaintained and completely broken on some platforms. You should be able to update smoothly to 1.4, but may have to make some small changes if you're using any of the deprecated code paths. They are mostly just API changes, so nothing major.
If you are looking for text book quality, then this [one](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/p/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python-michael-t-goodrich/1109717801/2661888465053?st=PLA&amp;sid=BNB_ADL+Marketplace+Good+New+Textbooks+-+Desktop+Low&amp;sourceId=PLAGoNA&amp;dpid=tdtve346c&amp;2sid=Google_c&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw04vpBRB3EiwA0IieajIylKvvDhf4KHI5soPrwxYAWe3bz-vk5l1iHb1_a7iufspFnqUJqRoCU8MQAvD_BwE) is one of the best. Unfortunately, the book is priced at college text book $$$. Runstone has a free one, but it's written by a Java programmer who is learning Python.
Thanks. I'll take a closer look as soon as the new version is packaged for Arch Linux.
Bump
Yeah I was able to get it.. Thx
While poop is less than doop, read lines. When find line, poop equals doop minus one. Poop plus equals one.
This is where enumerate() comes in handy.
Same for windowed, I prefer reading : l = [(a, b, c) for a, b, c in zip(l, l[1:], l[2:])] (with better names than a, b, c and l)
It is quiet useful when you are packing your program and your program has different modules as dependencies. I guess whatever makes writing program easier in Python's terminology.
maybe this [https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/index.html](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/index.html) I think there's some stuff buried in the Qt Wiki [https://wiki.qt.io/Main](https://wiki.qt.io/Main) or here [https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python) I'm not sure what your question means. I think designer files should only be manipulated in qtDesigner. I create my deigner file in qtDesigner and import it into my python code like so: from PySide2.QtUiTools import QUiLoader loader = QUiLoader() fn = QFile('path/to/designer/file.ui') fn.open(QFile.ReadOnly) self.frame = loader.load(fn) fn.close()
Thats what ive ben doing, so far its pretty accuarte but ive just been using apple stock and fake data so far.
Right. But assuming you are in /from/some/deep/level (that may be obvious, I suppose)

What did it do?
I've only recently finished working on a desktop application which is essentially an image optimisation tool called [MiniPics](https://minipics.io/). I created with Tkinter but if I am honest with myself, I am not too pleased with the GUI. I am thinking of redoing in a different GUI, perhaps PyQT.

Good old [archive.org](https://archive.org) will help you out. [https://web.archive.org/web/20190706231235/https://codeload.github.com/deepinstruction/deepnude\_official/zip/master](https://web.archive.org/web/20190706231235/https://codeload.github.com/deepinstruction/deepnude_official/zip/master)
I believe this is a general attack against disinformation tools. [9 days ago clone](https://github.com/Hengle/DeepNewdsForAndroid/blob/master/readme.txt) Looks like people were starting to clone it up. I don't really care about stuff like this but I think you got a lot of diehards who believe any action like this pushes us further from a "open internet". I myself do not know how to reconcile disinformation and hate speech in the modern world with people general unintelligent. Since a deep nude can give an average person the means to create semi-realistic but fake and incriminating "evidence" there are a number of places this could be abused, for instance if you use the app on a photo of a colleague. As the ability to know a genuine nude from a fake is somewhat non-trivial we basically can conclude it's *easier to cause harm with this app then it is to gain anything educationally*. Consider this last statement and the general point of OSS. Do you think most people using deep nude care about OSS and finally what do you think their objective is in using the software? Ethics is a complex issue but I personally would lean on the side that the technologically elite need try to keep things like this out of the hands of the average individual (just as much as facebook is a form of cancer). This of course is simply because I do not believe in technolgoical literacy in any great volume which seemed perhaps to become most clear in terms of "accerlating changes" when I watched the documentary, Plug &amp; Pray (which is to say most people treat software like an oracle).
This post should not be redirected to learnpython.
My first thought is - what version of Python are you using? This syntax was introduced in (I think) 3.7.
Https://www.ebay.com/robots.txt
No need to use incognito when fapping now!
I'm not a big fan of this: it breaks the pattern of absolute imports. ```python import a.b a.b() from c import d d() from . import e e() import .e e() # ?? ```
SQL is the most tedious and dry aspect of putting together an application. Avoid whenever possible.
That was very helpful ! Thank you so much.
Fun! Why must user input be str(1) and not int(1)? Easy enough to put an “or” and include both. I kept getting routed down the same path because int(1) wasn’t working. Finally I checked the code and saw the problem.
Saving for research purposes
&gt; there are a number of places this could be abused... I hate to be one of those "think of the kids" people but when I first heard about DeepNude my first thought was that this could end up being used to manufacture child porn with relative ease. &gt; it's *easier to cause harm with this app then it is to gain anything educationally*. IMO this should be the test on whether or not you release something into the world - will it do more harm than good?

&gt; self-censorship Can we stop using this word? Self-censorship is a self-invalidating phrase- the entire point of censorship is that an external force decides what is and is not allowed to be said. It is the very absence of self-determination. If I publish something and then unpublish it because I realize what I published does not represent my intent or has consequences beyond what I want, that's not self-censorship. It's self-direction and self-actualization.
If you can do a hello world program, you can do web scrapping
A better question is why not use a time series data store for time series data? InfluxDB as an example.
ah yes i forgot about robots.txt!
Same issues many, many people have written about having with it that basically all go under the rubric of not ready for prime time.
I completely agree with your statement. I will try to improve my clarity of this language in the future and I like both your alternatives. I think this is self-actualization. I am not completely convinced that you cannot encourage "self-censorship" in some fashion when there is legitimate censorship (e.g. China's media) but I completely agree in this case, the language is off.
&gt; will it do more harm than good? Right. I think traditionally engineers had a level of standards that asked questions like this. However, software development lacked the development of such an ethos. Move fast, break things, make enough to "gentrify". I don't know if I have ever read any literature on any type of ethos for software development except "A Hacker Manifesto" and it doesn't outline a philosophy of ethics as much as a philosophy of systematic issues within our vectoralized world.

I'm a huge supporter of free speech, and I'd like to do what I can to help prevent censorship, but then I found out it was written in Java.

&gt;IMO this should be the test on whether or not you release something into the world - will it do more harm than good? Based on whose entirely subjective definition of what constitutes "harm" and "good"?

I'm interested and have experience with Django and Machine Learning, but I'm a software developer at IBM so not sure how much time I could contribute. Could you clarify a bit more on what you're wanting/needing help with?
Probably ok here, but even better would be /r/learnpython. This is more a sub for news about Python (e.g., new releases of x, y, z). So if you are seeking feedback, as a new programmer, I'd definitely recommend that sub.
While this is censorship, some things (DeepFake, DeepNude) are something the bigger public is not ready for. Plus easy spread will give the censors the excuse to censor stuff they deem worthy of their attention by jist claiming that it is fake news created by a technique like df/dn
Could you provide yours?

There is no set amount of time needed to contribute. It all depends on how fast u can get things done. I need help on the Machine learning part of the project. I want to create an AI algorithm that, given a set of keywords, it tells the user what keywords are best for the to use. By best, I mean that they give the user the most chance on ranking at the top of that keyword. The AI algorithm would look at the user’s channel data, such as engagement rate and click through. I think a way this AI software could be trained is by looking at top channels in certain keywords and channels that don’t rank that high, and look at their engagement rate and click throughs. However, a problem is that this data is not available to the public and only when the user logs in to their account.

Can you point to any write-ups that give specifics about the problems? I just switched to using pipenv last week so I'm still new with it and have no idea what problems you are referring to.
From a technological point of view I wonder about that. I mean, the nets were trained with mature women and I doubt that there's enough data from children to accurately train models (or at least I hope so). But yeah, as much as I'm fascinated by the fact that all of this is possible, it is a tool that can only be used to deprive women from their body image and that's not ok children or not.
What was it for? Nothing there now...
Nevermind, reddit had not loaded the comments...
placing boobies on images that didnt have boobies
Self-censorship is when you remove content from your message to be in line with censored publishing spaces. It has nothing to do with self-actualization.
That's not self-censorship, that's just regular censorship. If you know ahead of time what the censor is likely to allow you to publish, you are not self-censoring, you are being censored.

Automate the Boring Stuff is the go-to starting book to learn Python. If you're doing data analytics you then want to look for tutorials to Pandas and Numpy, I recommend Codecademy or Udemy.
Well, boobies are nice and all but it can get a bit... wrong!
It's a kind of "deep fake" software that given a picture of a person can automatically edit in very realistic nude images of that person. Very believable nude images can be easily generated for any female (or male with further development). Being that things like "mail nude images of your ex to their boss and parents" is a common form of relationship revenge, this really breaks down the barn doors. The common wisdom "Don't let someone take nude pictures of you if you don't want them on the internet" doesn't much apply now that they can be easily and realistically faked. While yes, the cat's out of the bag, GitHub still wants to have no part in it.
Bokeh maybe? You’d need something else to serve the result. Plus loads of other stuff. If it’s just a interactive plot you can actually host those and serve them for GitHub for free using git pages. The requirement to be able to update every 5 minutes complicates things but you could do that separately. Maybe add websockets in bokeh to check for updates from your server.
Atleast throw the code in pastebin and link to that. Impossible to read.
ohh yes, lets ban it because we are too stupid to use it... /s
Buf i dont use chrome. 😑
It's a private platform. They can host whatever content they wish.
Finally I got the solution , as you said I included the required dll (all) files from vlc install folder , however I have to also include the pugins .
I mean, that's what we're doing with nuclear weapons, even though I'm sure someone could come up with practical applications for them
It can't be sensored. It's too easy to distribute and use this software. Trying to limit its spread will just create a false sense of security which would be even worse IMO.
How about using plain grep? grep -v '.' inputfile.csv &gt; outputfile.csv
But we don't really ban nucks. We all do it but pretend we don't. Like porns
I use the first one you mentioned, works great for me

hmm, I have mixed feelings about this
Would that allow me to remove the rows? This is just a test set I’m using to test the code. The real file I have is over 10GB that needs to be parsed so it has to be memory efficient.
Yeah, I'm using 3.7. Nice. Thanks for the discussion link. (What did you search for when looking for it btw?)
Oh I see. I'll check it out and hopefully it helps me. Thanks!

DeepDeNude could be useful... toss some clothes or something on photos of disturbing contents that have to be reviewed, change bodily fluids to laser beams or something not joking here either. The technology has real human value.

That's really good. I actually done the same thing just last week but more for humidity in my house (turned out it was at 70%). I've got mine getting the temperature/humidity every 5 minutes using a DHT22 and stores it in a mysql database. Also created a php page to display the data.
Faith in his family values, you mean ;) ?
You could use requests + beautifulSoup &amp; and a DB, parse the page and compare it with your stored version
`grep` is a unix utility that allows filtering input by search terms. Unix utilities are built to do one thing and do it very well. That means they are fast and memory efficient. In particular if you have a file that is 10GB, you don't want to parse the entire thing and keep it in memory and grep won't do that. This will work fine with a 10GB file even if you have (way) less memory than 10GB on your system.
That’s what Im talking about, this is pure crap
Pandas by default will try to load the whole thing into memory, so stock pandas isn’t probably the right solution in this case.
You make some good points. Counterpoint: If it's OSS, then somebody could hypothetically design a program that determines whether a nude is deepfaked or not by reverse-engineering the algorithm that creates the fakes. I'm not sure if that's actually possible, but if only some "tech elite" has the source, then they exclusively get to decide whether this will be done.
easiest if you don't treat it as a csv, but as just a text file with lines - see Mr Notimpressed16's answer. But I'm guessing you are using Pandas or something since you mentioned Series and want to stay in that mode so the brute force method it to loop over the rows, and loop over the columns, and build up a new list of rows if they pass your test - then make a new DataFrame out of that. No shame in that super-basic method if it gets your problem solved fast - and 50k rows is small enough that you probably don't care about speed. If you need this to be efficient then it's going to depend on just what your data is like and find some suitable vectorized method or some upstream place in your code to do the filtering. OH, found your problem. contains(“.”) is treating the "." as a regex. so either escape it or add regex=False. see the docs: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.str.contains.html
These apps certainly appear better suited for the purpose - but I was curious mostly from the angle of network system limitations - I would not be able to install any of these apps without a lengthy IT approval process. Everyone has python installed however.
I saw when that went up. The deepnude team argued that immediately after they announced it it was reverse engineered and available elsewhere so they felt compelled to release everything. I can't remember exactly what the readme said but something to that effect.

Frankly. Doing this just makes me want to see it (the source code) more. I saw the repo while on reddit yesterday, I didn’t care so I brushed past it. Now they’ve removed it, I have a vested desire to see it. That’s kind of how human nature works, removing it has just made people want to see it more.

Looks promising - whats the general concept behind the hosting/server aspect of Bokeh (again, never used python for hosting web interface - this is new to me). Is there just a file output that anyone with the path can open in web browser - essentially some kind of HTML wrapped dashboard - or is it more complex than that.
Probably copied from yt and it did this nonsense redirection.
This is one of those projects that you should tackle with one and only one mindset: How can I get this done as conveniently as possible for me personally? Pretty sure OP asked themselves this question and the answer was to go with MongoDB. Since I, on the other hand, am more comfortable with various SQLs, I probably would've gone with SQLite. But it doesn't matter -- it doesn't matter at all. A CSV file wouldn't been just fine, too.
But when the anticipated consequences are unreasonable – when people are deterred from saying things that it would be better for all parties concerned to have out in the open – that's not a good thing, and it's appropriate to call it something that has a negative connotation. Now, to be clear, I'm not arguing that DeepNude is one of those things that it's better to have out in the open. Just that there are other times when "being deterred from saying something" ends up being at odds with "self-actualization".
Very cool!

&gt; when people are deterred from saying things that it would be better for all parties concerned to have out in the open – that's not a good thing, and it's appropriate to call it something that has a negative connotation. Let's stop "self-censoring" this thread. Self-censorship is used to describe situations where someone doesn't say a thing because they fear social consequences for saying that thing. It's used in situations where there is no actual censor, just an understanding that the reaction to the speech will be negative. That is *not* censorship, as there is no one to tell them they can't say that thing. It's recognition that the thing they're about to say is wildly unpopular for whatever reason, justified or not. Choosing not to say the unpopular thing is not "self-censorship". It's a choice that you don't want to deal with the consequences of what you want to say, and it's rooted in the idea that "freedom" includes "freedom from consequences", which is just a stupid position to take. Also, it's worth noting that, while you *might* be the secret genius who sees the world in a way that others can't appreciate but should, it's way more likely that if you think you're going to suffer social retribution for what you want to say, you're just an asshole.
Python's [built-in csv module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) won't load the whole file into the memory, but you'll be able to read the csv line by line and do your thing.
The PSF. Anyone can make changes, but there is a proposal, code, and review process that you have to follow in order to get a change accepted. It somewhat depends on the change though. For bug and documentation fixes, the process is far shorter. For large changes to the language, a PEP or python enhancement proposal must be submitted. The steering council then votes or delegates a person to decide.
I frequently end up consulting the Qt docs, even though they're for c++.
Bad example. Nothing about how nukes are made is censored, although the actual yields and number of resulting weapons is usually classified by whatever government is running the program. The issue is that the enrichment process is technical, complicated, expensive, and requires precision engineering, all on a large enough scale to make it difficult to hide (which then brings the attention of the international community). In this case I think there's an argument about what purpose the software serves, and GitHub being a private platform can ban whatever they want.
I would use the python inbuilt csv module to read the file line by line and check if there is a . and then output the lines that don't too another file by appending. Only one line at a time in memory at any time.

I don't think it's possible. Like a cryptographic hash, it's a one-way transformation and all the state used to create it is discarded and not available in the output. It's possible it could be "broken" but being open source hasn't automatically caused any hashes to be broken or necessarily even made it much easier. The only way to match an end result to any original images would be brute force, and the search space would be astronomical.
You'll want to escape that dot.
The phrase "self-censorship" is traditionally used to describe when one does not publish (or removes) content from fear of reprisal or because of an outside force. You can argue the semantics if you want, but it's a pretty accepted meaning.
grep '.' &lt;file&gt; says "find every row with a . in it and print that". &amp;#x200B; grep -v '.' says "find every row WITHOUT a . and print that". &amp;#x200B; The only way you're going to get it any faster than that is writting a \*really\* tight C program. &amp;#x200B; I really do like python, but sometimes other tools work better. &amp;#x200B; If you REALLY want to use python, or if you wanted to remove the lines with a . prior to processing you could: 3 with open('dotfile.csv', 'r') as f: 4 for line in f: 5 if not '.' in line: 6 print(line.strip()) This would print every line without a . If you do this and and compare it to grep I think you'll find that grep is a brazillion times faster. &amp;#x200B; However, if you wanted to process the 10 gig file without loading those lines you could do something like: 3 def processor_function(): 4 """ Here is where I do stuff """- 5 6 pass 7 8 9 with open('dotfile.csv', 'r') as f: 10 for line in f: 11 if not '.' in line: 12 processor_function(line) &amp;#x200B; If you build up processor function properly you can avoid keeping irrelevant data and objects in memory.
So two things I would say are 1) I see you're using a csv file here with links in it? An improvement would be to use a database like sqlite for holding data. 2) you have a function called wall_dl which has a loop through the csv, and it often goes if condition: do this continue else: do something else and you end up quite deeply nested, but the continue statement actually means that you skip all the remaining stuff anyway, so you don't need 'else' so you can do if condition: do this continue do something else so that will neaten that function up a lot because it tabs in about 4 levels. This is why I like the continue statement.
May be against the grain here, but the technology of deepfakes etc is here, happening, and being progressed, regardless of any particular repository. Given that fact, we can either 1. allow it to be worked on in the open, where everyone can see how it works, how easy it is to do, and exactly what it's capable of, with good reporting at regular intervals 2. hide the fact that it's being developed by banning it from publicly-visible spaces, and allow the world to be surprised when videos of a nude Kamala Harris whipping Native American toddlers show up, and *then* have to try to explain that the technology to fake this is *probably* not that hard but we can't prove it because we can't see the code, at which point it sounds like excuses. I'll pick the first one.
wow that must be the worst thing they could have possibly done, now everyone will hunt this down and keep sharing it, fucking geniuses.
This can never be stopped. You can easily make fake nudes in photoshop. This just makes it a little bit easier. It's the distribution of fake nudes that are unethical not the tools.
As a traditional solution, Cron comes in my mind on VM (virtual machine). Cron gives you ability to schedule periodical tasks. On the other hand, as I recall, you can use scrapy (python crawling lib) scraper hosting service which will allow to do the job you've described.

Thank you. I'll look into this.
A word documente
it would be worth billions if it was
&gt; From a technological point of view I wonder about that. I mean, the nets were trained with mature women and I doubt that there's enough data from children to accurately train models (or at least I hope so). Unfortunately wrong. I know the UK Home Office is working on a model that can rate the seriousness of indecent images of children, which saves humans having to do it. I imagine the deep net would have a similar sized dataset.
"Since a deep nude can give an average person the means to create semi-realistic but fake and incriminating "evidence" there are a number of places this could be abused, for instance if you use the app on a photo of a colleague." A counterpoint to this: if artifically making explicit content based on non-explicit media becomes accessible/ubiquitous, then such things in general will not be taken to be evidence. At the very least, people will view their evidentiary value with some caution, being aware that videos and pictures do not prove with certainty that the event depicted in the video/picture took place. In fact, I may take a step further: even people who were victims of "revenge porn" could credibly argue that the "revenge porn" is not in fact them, but an artificial creation. So, not only would the "value" of revenge porn decrease in general (it's not necessary real), actual victims could use "deep nude" as a shield (against something they really shouldn't have to be harmed by). A counterpoint to "people who use deep nude don't actually care about OSS": what if intention is not the most important thing? For example, a lot of wealthy people and companies engage in "social activism." Some people might genuinely care. Some people might not genuinely care - their real objective may be positive publicity plus tax deduction. However, at the end of the day what you have is more money/help/resources for people in disadvantaged situations. Maybe we should not say the world should be "perfect and more perfect"; maybe it is enough to say "imperfect but a little less imperfect." Another point: we can look at this in different ways. One is "some activity that's unproductive and morally reproachable is shut down." Another is "a person has interest in some project (which s/he has right to work on), started working on it, published his current progress so others who are interested can take a look, a lot of people were also interested, and now a big company whose business model is to host projects is shutting it down to prevent negative publicity." A concrete example: what do you think if Mcdonald's started saying: "if you're over 250lbs, then we will not sell you any food because it is immoral for us to encourage people at risk of obesity to consume more fast food." Consider that Mcdonald's saying "we won't provide (food) service to certain people" is not that different from github saying "we won't provide (hosting) service to certain projects." Of course, someone metnioned that the hoster herself/himself pulled it down, which would make this inapplicable. But until that was discovered the discussion was about whether it is better to remove "unproductive" FOSS projects from the public.

They are a private organisation. How on earth is it censorship?
The next "easy" step is to use bokeh with bottle to display the data in real time! Bokeh come with a nice AjaxDatasource that can update the plot every n seconds with a http request.
Check out google cloud, AWS, and azure 'free tier' offerings. This way you can get a machine running in the cloud, and use the 'bucket' storage (called S3 for AWS) as a good store for data you want to persist outside of the running machine. You generally connect to the machines by ssh-ing into a terminal session - depending on your familiarity with terminal this can be a big learning curve but worth it for learning how to automate!

Yes there is, this isn't one of them. This is a brand new think with serious ethical implications. The debate is far from over and this is a legitimate case of suppressing technology. I don't have a dog in this fight so I don't care either way but shutting down debate is bad for everyone. Personally I'll be waiting for people who actually know wtf they're talking about to release their thoughts before I form an opinion.
Thanks for pointing that out, I updated my post.
As is a lot of stuff that runs the internet. So what?
IIRC the process to make a hydrogen bomb has been censored by the government. Someone spent forever interviewing people and came up with a working theory of how to do it, and when they went to publish it they were sued by the government.
Didn't know influxdb, I keep that for the next one ;) Yet, my response apply : not that much data, very simple structure. I used whatever I found easier to use. Sqlite would have been an other good choice. First trial was very lazy with csv written each day, but resulted in tedious processing of the data. Second attempt was more careful with clean separation between the acquisition, the storage and the exposure of the data, an resulted in way more robust tool.
They should take down GIMP, too, then.
My issue with that is that a word document will always try to “correct” the code whether that be changing words or changing the indents, so that can be pretty annoying.
Censorship does not have to be by a government, GH is a public authority when it comes to open source code, how is it not!?
It’s their site. They can do what they like. That’s not censoring
Accuracy of time series like stock price is extremely tricky to establish as most of the models give persistence prediction i.e. today's predicted price is yesterday's actual closing price which minimizes loss function.

Every project I do is mostly doing stuff I don't already know how to do! The fun part is learning and discovering, isn't it?
&gt; my first thought was that this could end up being used to manufacture child porn with relative ease. So whilst i understand why this thought might sit uncomfortably, let's just play this out. You'd be talking about generating images that caused **no** children to be harmed in their generation. The harm in CP is in the abuse of the child, not the image, the revulsion felt by the normal viewer, or the jollys of the sick person using it. A tech removing the "need" to abuse children doesn't seem like a bad thing to me. (Nobody should take this as a defence of CP in the slightest)
walking around and using ai to make people look naked in real time is basically the high tech equivalent of peeping in someones window while they change.

Include a license file, a requirements.txt and/or a setup.py file so people can actually install it, and for the love of all that is holy put the tiniest bit of effort to clean up things like: self.endyear2.addItem('1979', 1979) self.endyear2.addItem('1980', 1990) self.endyear2.addItem('1981', 1991) self.endyear2.addItem('1982', 1992) self.endyear2.addItem('1983', 1993) self.endyear2.addItem('1984', 1994) self.endyear2.addItem('1985', 1995) self.endyear2.addItem('1986', 1996) self.endyear2.addItem('1987', 1997) self.endyear2.addItem('1988', 1998) self.endyear2.addItem('1989', 1999) self.endyear2.addItem('1990', 1990) self.endyear2.addItem('1991', 1991) self.endyear2.addItem('1992', 1992) self.endyear2.addItem('1993', 1993) self.endyear2.addItem('1994', 1994) self.endyear2.addItem('1995', 1995) self.endyear2.addItem('1996', 1996) self.endyear2.addItem('1997', 1997) self.endyear2.addItem('1998', 1998)
There are several libraries in Python that create things for the web using JavaScript. https://www.flowerofdesign.com/DataExploration/ShortstownData/EPC14-9Paths.html This example uses the folium library to create leaflet.js maps. It is particularly pertinent because the map tiles are loaded via api call to open street map.

Why would anyone support that kind of code? It's disgusting and doesn't have any functional or educational way to use it.
I searched for dict unpacking comprehension. The SO post is good but leaves your question unanswered, I think. Maybe the grammar you have quoted is the grammar that would have been in place if the PEP had been fully implemented, as opposed to the partial implementation without the unpacking, which one commenter mentions was removed during the PEP process.
I agree it would be better if we all pretend bad things don't exist and not analyze them.
I dont see how. You would still need actual footage of kids to splice in.
&gt; GitHub gonna start policing my code now too? This wasn't github. The dev pulled removed the code
No idea why people have the idea that “censorship is only done by the government.” Simply not true. Of course github has the right to dictate what is on their website, but that is still objectively the textbook definition of censorship.
That is true, geace you tryed the note block in windows?
Valid point and I’m sure you’ll get some backlash. How can a fake picture be justified as a crime? Isn’t sick? Yes, but there is no victim and it’s not real period, so can it be justified as actual CP? Interesting questions coming about because of this technology.
Something something the emperor has no clothes.
With that test we have to remove Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc. They are causing ton more harm than good, exacerbating loneliness, contributing to rise I suicides, allowing bullying to follow someone forever, and empowering terrorists to recruit and nation states to more effectively interfere with each other's elections. Oh wait, you disagree? You think that all the good social networks do outweighs the bad? Now you see the slippery slope. You might think this is a slam dunk easy one to nix, but the slippery slope argument comes from understanding that the next one might look harmful and of no value to you but I might find it essential. Or you might find it reprehensible and I might find it wonderful. What I don't want is a bunch of billionaires deciding what we can and can't publish.
Most people have a vested interest in that anyways. And your equating ② different things, which I can only surmise you’re doing in this very specific case because of what the ② things are. This technology is inevitable, censoring it, making it harder to find etc. Isn’t gonna change that. People who want it, will find it. We’ve opened the box, now the only thing we can do is research the technology and devise ways to detect and remove deep fakes on a large scale, not make the means to their creation harder as if that’s gonna stop anyone. Will deep fakes still exist. Yes. But that’s a far better solution than this.
Why would you try to make this about gun control?
&gt; Quick edit, looks like it was pulled by the user (source). Only the commercial tool was pulled by the user, but they reuploaded it a few days later GitHub and changed the license to GPLv3. That Open Source release is what got taken down now.
I just started today, more-or-less as a beginner with experience in networking. I copied a wee code for a simple "Number Guess game". Looked through learning stuff a little bit and ended up improving the game a bit by adding text that says "Value must be between 1-20" if you were to guess a value less than zero or greater than 20.
Sorry, I am a beginner. I know that is existing and maybe cover your needs. I wish i could help you more.
There’s one part you forgot though. This software needs an image to start with. It effectively removes clothing from an image. That means this is still not a victimless crime as the person who’s photo they used still has to deal with there being an (altered) nude of them on the internet.
Tip to save like 100 lines of code: Use loops when calling the addItem function so you don’t have to hardcode it over and over again
Clothing has utilitarian function, as anyone who fell for the cooking bacon topless meme quickly found out.
Traditional engineering gave us the atom bomb, then one upped its "ethics" by building the "super", aka the fusion or hydrogen bomb. Yeah traditionally engineering is full of ethics, just ask Boeing.

I’m totally OK with pedophiles comissioning CP art. But the problem with DeepNude CP would be that you’d have to give it training data, which probably can’t be art but has to be actual photographs. So…
The video one is called DeepFake and that one doesn't create nudes, it is just a sophisticated face-swap application that can be used to put peoples faces into porn, but it is also used for all kinds of comedic videos like putting Stallone into Terminator 2 or Nic Cage into literally everything.

There is a victim---someone still has a faked nude pic of them. It's not equivalent to loli.

Ok, but that's a lot further down the scale of harm caused.
Hahahahahahaha!
Same as always. A healthy mix of society, platform owners, and legislative bodies.
Except that would cause a syntax error. (?)
This is BS. I get that ”it could be used for bad things” but what would stop a willing and capable person from photoshopping the same image? I recon the photoshop one would be a lot more realistic. Banning code this way is simply not a longterm solution for github. Who knows what they will ban next? Its quite common knowledge that github employs sjw´s (see opal gate). Banning this kind of repos is just one step ahead of banning repos the gh team ”just dont like” or ”is not accepted in gh”
Maybe even r/suspiciouslyspecific

That is right. Always do an explicit import. Not knowing where the classes or functions used are comming from is bad form.
We know there are algorithms that can easily generate hundreds of thousands of unique faces that don’t actually exist. This is hypothetical of course, but then would it be victimless?
what about sourceforge and bitbucket???
I'm not unsympathetic to the argument, but I'm not convinced either. 1. DeepNude doesn't generate new images of the subject--it unclothes an existing subject. That's a real harm to anyone, especially children. 2. From what I understand, child pornography usage tends to correlate with anti-social personality traits. To me that suggests that the people who view it don't necessarily have a different sexuality than the public at large, they're just terrible people who either don't care about the abuse, or find it the abuse itself a turn on. I worry that normalizing even "synthetic child pornography" could work as a gateway---eroding individuals' disgust with the concept and ultimately increasing demand for the real thing.
Nice! This worked perfectly!
I'd wager that it would be best for the fake credit card generator to also remain available, since that would make it easier for banks to develop countermeasures.
Is the same thing as letting the people inside a development team to handle their own packages or forcing them to use only a master repository handleded by a system administrator. I think we are big enough to learn from our mistakes, but ofc some other people think the other way.
What's your question?
I don’t understand why “this code is bad and should not exist” is such a hot take.
Not sure how it’s working for the question.
[removed]
Well said.
you're welcome [https://github.com/ossu/computer-science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) [https://github.com/ossu/data-science](https://github.com/ossu/data-science)
&gt; There are plenty of non-malicious use cases for this software. Citation needed.
So it's like Wikipedia (ish)? Does the same thing is true for other languages or the process varies and depends on who own the particular language?
Is anyone else hosting it?
I don't know if it is the same code or not but a YouTube channel recently used something like that to make a video of fake real looking Tom Cruise.
&gt; and in both options we can see Kamala Harris nude. win-win Bruh... no. Just... no. Like seeing your hairy uncle in a Speedo. Please... just no.
I don't know much about ML stuff. what are they for? where to they go?
The function is taking the array and adding each item to see if there are any matches, if there is a match, it then adds 1 to solution, after adding to the solution it then adds the single item to the set.
I guess someone could argue that the people in the images used for training are victims but that's too abstract and diffused IMO. In that example, it's more like loli.
Fuck MS.
Porn for Mormons
I don't see 1) on the same scale of harm as actually sexually, physically and mentally abusing children. Nowhere near, so a tech which swaps one for the other is not doing harm IMHO, but then I've said that in another comment and I'm getting down votes, so maybe others don't share that opinion. As far as 2) goes, currently distribution and possession of CP is a crime. I'm not saying that that should change. I'm saying enabling the generation of fake images probably reduces the total level of harm to children in society, and certainly doesn't increase it.
Elon Musk has warned AI is an underrated threat many times. And he knows a lot more about AI then all of us on Reddit. The banning of code on github is a canary in a coal mine about what the future holds; a complete distortion of reality and a world with chaotic interpretations on what is true.
Anton Levay calls this the Law of the Forbidden
well, to get something objective you need it to be from an external source i.e god. but don't forget that good and bad are synonymous to moral and immoral-at least in the context. so, there is a whole debate about this and i don't think this is the place for it.
It looks like the code has been removed from github. Any chance you’re willing to share what you have?
&gt;as anyone who fell for the cooking bacon topless meme quickly found out. Are you attacking me!?
Read the readme file on the GitHub repo
Yeah someone already mentioned that to me I am incorporating it into stockpredictedv0.1.1. Thank you!
Excellent--those links are very helpful. Thanks for providing them!
Ok thank you i will post it there as well for feedback. Happy coding!
I dont get the purpose behind array = set() and not sure where the elements are being added to verify if they exist.
&gt; so if you create web scrapers to collect data from the internet... do web servers generally pick up on this and perhaps start blocking your connections? &amp;#x200B; What they pick up on is the frequency and number of connections from a single IP or IP block(s). &amp;#x200B; If you "scrape" a half dozen URLS every say hour or two you're not going to get dinged. If you're scraping \*EVERYTHING\* frequently you will. &amp;#x200B; Back in the day I worked for an auction management company that would scrape Ebay, Yahoo Auctions and the other one (AOL? Can't remember) constantly. We paid a contractor to maintain a fleet of servers that would make the actual connection, changing IP addresses and etc. where necessary. They knew we were doing it, and would try to shut us down. Eventually they developed the API, and we retired the scrapers. Oh, and when the page changed we had to re-write the scrapers (note that I wasn't invovled on that side of things, I was an SA). &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &gt; would it be viable to make a web scraper that performed this functionality with something like ebay or amazon? &amp;#x200B; Probably not. Ebay and Amazon are a LOT bigger product space than WoW, so you're going to be dealing with brazillians of objects. Also I don't know WoW all that well, so I don't know if they degraded the utility of "used" items, but in the real world you have objects with a MASSIVE dis-similarity in quality--between "new in package" to "for parts only", as well as location, shipping, etc. etc. There probably IS some room for arbitrage there, but it's going to be tiny. &amp;#x200B; Also you'd be better off using their API and focusing on your arbitrage algorithm than building a scrapper.
thats commie talk
Oh is that the correct format? My bad. I will put that into the updated version and I will do your other suggestions. Thanks!

How about openly talking about it *while* not giving these projects publicity and a platform to flourish?
I think these are fair critiques. Often more than ethics, I mean standards and regulation. Since most of our representatives do not even know the fundamental nature of modern technology and applications, this seems frankly unachievable without some new division within our governance. I do not even know who would take such a mission, doesn't quite seem consistent with the nature of the FCC. However, I am in completely agreement that there is no "business ethics". When the business drives, ethics disappear and I think your statement about Boeing is this kind of downward trend. I once had a mentor describe this as "business vs busyness" that in effort most business is just busy work and not focused on the crux of issues.
I don't think that's how information works.
Thank you for these clarifications. Please feel free to let me know if you would like me to edit that into my comment.
&gt; Nothing about how nukes are made is censored that's not true at all. the specific mechanisms for even the Trinity device and Little Man and Fatboy are *still* classified. the general principles for how they operate is well understood because that's relatively simple conceptually, but the actual engineering and electrical and mechanical parts within warheads is definitely classified
You can't run excel formulas with reference cells through python like you're asking but what you could do is something like this: Open up your excel file and parse the data to where you modify the value of all the cells containing the formulas that you'd like to keep to be `value = '=FORMULATEXT(' + value + ')'` This converts the original formula to text which can then be opened as normal through pandas and saved into a dataframe as a string. The harder part would now be writing something that goes through those formulas and determines which row:series that excel reference now reflects. I'm not sure if its the best way to go about it though.
That depends a lot on what you mean by "censored", and "how nukes are made." The basic idea of how nuclear weapons work isn't a secret, and a motivated person with the right kind of expertise can design a nuclear weapon. But a lot more than just yield is classified information. In fact, in the US, NW information is "born classified", which means it is considered classified until a determination is made that it doesn't need to be. There are components of Fat Man and Little Boy that remain classified nearly 75 years later.
I think the counterpoint is that offering a viral pathway to spread propaganda is a bad idea. Disinformation and harassment campaigns are already demonstrating how functionally illiterate people are being weaponized to spread disinformation. No one cares _how_ these programs work. The most you can say is _it's nice to know that people are aware of how information is faked_. At the end of the day, knowing _how_ isn't the same as determining _if_. They are incongruous. Like P = NP, they are not apriori connections. Knowing _how_ this works isn't the same as knowing _if_. If you want this in a clinical location, the put it up on researchgate.net or some other educational forum that lets the people who need to derive _if_ from _how_. Github has demonstrated itself as a social platform, not a research one.
anything in the finance space?
Ah, I see, I missed your point initially. Yes engineers have produced organizations such as the SAE and others that provide standards. I'm not familiar with all of them but to my understanding there are standards organizations for every major branch of engineering EXCEPT software. Mainly because, to be nice, software was popularized and monetized by those unfamiliar with engineering practices and the needs for standards. Silicone valleys ethos is antithetical to good engineering.
I mean it sounds like you are describing the general idea of an "arms race". Yes, this could exist but what is the value? In fact the time it takes to come up with the solution is probably non-trivial and ultimately will have some errors again. When we sum these errors, the total output of the system is more error prone (which returns to the issue of disinformation). So even if you had a good program, it's not perfect, and then people would have faith in the program that checks if a picture may be a deep fake, but since it's flawed, they conclude it's not a deep fake when it's the 0.1% that still is a deep fake. There can be no perfect solution to this and the race never ends... Likewise the issue you outline is a generalized issue of any elite system. To be more clear, I believe in consensus, I believe what is being developed with block-chain technology is profound in many regards, but when I look at computer literacy, I don't know if there is any point in my life where I have felt the average individual has much competency. I just saw a person in restaurant not able to use a drink machine with a touch screen and a single button... I don't know how to reconcile that when I tutored people they concluded the machine just knows the solution to being a chess grand master... there is no oracle... but there are lots superstitious people using technology and your grandparents who poked the computer like it was going to explode aren't even the worst cases... So I agree. The arms race could be fruitful for experts in signature science and image artifacts but generally it's just a waste of bits, energy, etc. More so, I don't think technological elite solve the issue of bad actors, it just reduces the number of people you have to check are "good" (and I don't believe many people even understand what "good computing" looks like which is itself a great debate to have but is probably a kin to "no true scotsman").
I don't think this is true. Let's take a more basic app, consider the app that puts cat faces on people. Do you think we could write an app to find with decent accuracy pictures that have had cat faces added? If nothing else, contrast and edge detection should blow up with anomalies, of which you can build the necessary artifacts from the algorithms process, to likewise with a high probability say the image is a deep fake. Is this trivial? No, it's signature science, like the people who design bomb detectors and facial recognition. At the end of the day, I think it's doable but it's not profitable (not yet at least -- problem would have to get worse)
That’s the whole purpose of set. It contains only unique elements
Django Rest Framework is probably the most popular option for building REST API's with python.
this program don't work cause of array = set() and then if i + k in array: if i - k in array: this makes no sense cause of array is empty set and program skip half of answers [correct example](http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#code=def%20pairs%28k,%20arr%29%3A%0A%20%20%20%20array%20%3D%20set%28%29%0A%20%20%20%20solution%20%3D%200%0A%20%20%20%20for%20i%20in%20arr%3A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20if%20i%20%2B%20k%20in%20arr%3A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20solution%20%2B%3D%201%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20if%20i%20-%20k%20in%20arr%3A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20solution%20%2B%3D%201%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20array.add%28i%29%0A%20%20%20%20return%20solution%0Apairs%282,%20%5B1,5,3,4,2%5D%29&amp;cumulative=false&amp;curInstr=33&amp;heapPrimitives=nevernest&amp;mode=display&amp;origin=opt-frontend.js&amp;py=3&amp;rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&amp;textReferences=false)
It's simply creating an empty set that can be used if there were multiple if clauses or loops. &amp;#x200B; The function is above is being called as `pairs(2, 1 5 3 4 2)` &amp;#x200B; # this line is creating an empty set array = set() # this line is taking the item found in the for loop and adding it to the array array.add(i)
Uh sorry lol, can you clarify?
This is incorrect. Here's a counterexample: $ ls foo.py test.py $ cat foo.py def fn(): print('foo.fn') $ cat test.py from . import foo foo.fn() $ python test.py Traceback (most recent call last): File "test.py", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; from . import foo ImportError: cannot import name 'foo' from '__main__' (test.py) As a few people in the thread have pointed out, the dot refers to the current module. It's not a hack at all, it's necessary when you're building modules instead of standalone scripts. I believe [PEP328](https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0328/) is the thing to look at if you want some background on why/how relative imports work.
Either you believe in the free proliferation of ideas and technology or you don't, and I think society already chose its path despite any individual's wishes a long time ago. This stuff is already common-place enough to argue that all photos of anybody ever are not susceptible to extra doubt. It's actually a nice counter-point to the trend of *everybody having a camera*. Privacy returns in the form of permanent skepticism. I don't know why GitHub is banning it. Just accept it.
Flask. If you do want concurrency go Elixir/Phoenix.
It doesn't, but the related https://github.com/open-deepnude repository disappeared around the same time, which is suspicious. Other deepnude stuff is however still online: https://github.com/topics/deepnude https://github.com/deep-man-yy/easydeepnude
I think you are confusing censorship with first amendment violations. Anyone can censor, only the government can violate the first amendment... Not sure about other countries.
Please provide some text here explaining what kind of news this is, and why someone should watch it.
Professor at my University is building a adversarial AIs one that makes better deep fakes and the other that gets better at detecting them.... Interesting stuff for sure. Her work requires that she get better at doing the bad thing so she can be better at doing the good thing. Interesting moral shit going on in there.
Yes. We are in complete agreement now. I need to be more mindful to use better language here other than "ethics" because I have been called out for this before (i.e. calling software developers unethical). **Silicone valleys ethos is antithetical to good engineering.** Right. So I thought I was following in an engineers footsteps when I became a software developer (e.g. being a 2nd/3rd generational engineer) but man did I get a rude ass awakening in my early career. In fact, the greatest time I had in software develop was actually working with scientists (where I used a lot of Python) who have to be more careful by nature of the complexity and cost of their work. Now, I am just a burnout who wants to explore the world and see if one of these developing economies bets us to the next big scientific break through because it seems our tech boom has create a mental handicap in much of the western world.
Educating folks on the specific algorithms used to create these in order to better spot the fakes.
Different floats for different folks.
&gt; So, not only would the "value" of revenge porn decrease in general (it's not necessary real), actual victims could use "deep nude" as a shield (against something they really shouldn't have to be harmed by). Nude photos aren't a free market, this won't suddenly tank the values and potential damage done by real ones. It's going to take a long time before a nude photo (real or fake) means nothing, which isn't much comfort for people who get fakes used against them in the meantime.
If k=2 and arr = 1 5 3 4 2. And array = set() then in the first loop i = 1 and i + k = 3 and the condition is if i + k in array then solution += 1. What is i +k is being compared to? What values?
But this program is actually working. Thats the whole purpose of this discussion. Why is it working?
Publicity is the thing we absolutely need. Tech people being aware of the possibility is meaningless when the majority of the voting, jury-serving public are not tech people: it'll be dismissed as a far-future conspiracy theory, just like the depth of today's surveillance by governments and corporations was (and even is, to a great extent). It needs to be talked about, and if the topic of that discussion is the New York Post saying "look at what these sick nerds have been doing!", that's still better than the cutting edge of video faking being developed in a secret underground lab somewhere. The media, and the public in general, needs to understand that videos found on the internet are no longer a source of truth. The media and technology need to adapt to this by adopting traceable cryptographic signing as standard, and consumers need to recognise that without that proof of providence, what they're seeing is probably not truthful.
&gt; It effectively removes clothing from an image. That means this is still not a victimless crime as the person who’s photo they used still has to deal with there being an (altered) nude of them on the internet. Nope. Can use this now to get "photos of children": https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com/
Yes, I don't think it's going away either. It begun with the DeepFakes (AI assisted fake videos) and now there's the same for pictures. One might say videos were more advanced, but I actually think this later one was an evolution because this DeepNude thing worked with far higher resolutions than video frames and had to produce even more convincing results. Now that this one is shut down it's only a matter of time before something even better happens.
Besides the arguing going on here I have to ask: why is this in the python subreddit?
&gt; we can **all** agree on some basic good and bad No we literally cannot. There is an island tribe by Ternate that thinks (what we consider to be child torture) to be a good thing. Jews think its a good thing to mutilate their children's penises. Muslims think its a good thing to slaughter animals alive. Hindus think its a good thing to sell your daughter for political or financial power. Africans think its a good thing to mutilate their daughter's genitalia.
The threat of negative consequence amounts to censorship. If the consequence was "the police will put you in jail" would you call it censorship? Many people prefer to only call it censorship if the government is doing it, but if that's what you're getting at it's a different point. "self-censorship" just means the mechanism of censorship is punishment after the fact, rather than removal of the material or a requirement to get permission. That's all. The result is still that you can't say something you want to say, which is why it is censorship. You might distinguish between social vs legal consequences and see one as censorship and one not, but again that applies to censorship in general and has nothing to do with the "self-" prefix, which is just a statement about the *method* of preventing you from saying what you want, not what the consequences are, whether they are legal or social, and whether they are imposed by a government or by private individuals.
*strokes
This is why we can't have nice things
"Oh, no! There are fake nude photos of me on the internet!" Yeah, well, it's going to be you along with everyone else now. Who's going to care at that point? Things like this are inevitable and unstoppable. You can either run from it or accept it. You can't fight it. You cannot close the box that has been opened.
Thanks for a thorough reply. &gt; A counterpoint to this: if artifically making explicit content based on non-explicit media becomes accessible/ubiquitous, then such things in general will not be taken to be evidence. At the very least, people will view their evidentiary value with some caution, being aware that videos and pictures do not prove with certainty that the event depicted in the video/picture took place. Right once you have ubiquity you have no diversity. You still have to get to this state and that's costly and wasteful or do we disagree about the nature of human time expenditure? &gt; In fact, I may take a step further: even people who were victims of "revenge porn" could credibly argue that the "revenge porn" is not in fact them, but an artificial creation. So, not only would the "value" of revenge porn decrease in general (it's not necessary real), actual victims could use "deep nude" as a shield (against something they really shouldn't have to be harmed by). It's hard to explain the issue with this. However, if you follow this to it's logical conclusion, the conclusion is no image can be personally identifiable because if all it takes is an app to remove any ability for someone to gain reasonable certainity, then I can just make an app that makes everyone look like dogs... and now tell me when you have sex with your girlfriend, is that bestiality? We need common ground and we need to understand what that is and how it has been built by the people before us. More important, if there isn't a rhythm or a reason, then we probably don't "need" it -- i.e. it's humbug. &gt; A counterpoint to "people who use deep nude don't actually care about OSS": what if intention is not the most important thing? Fair enough. Here we have to define common ground. Intention is a big deal to me. It is the basis by which we decide what actions are "reasonable" and likewise judge our fellow citizens when we are called to such as being a juror. &gt; However, at the end of the day what you have is more money/help/resources for people in disadvantaged situations. Right. The most help here is to stop the arms race before it starts and avoid people the humbug of "deep fakes" but more importantly we should totally not be so silly as to believe one mistake here will fix the mistake that developed into "revenge porn" (which is to say since you raise the issue, clearly society has generated this issue somehow, sometime). On your final point. I was corrected. It sounds like the commercial product was taken down, then a GPL version was added and cloned a few times. These clones were taken down by Github. So I think we agree here this is censorship... I think we agree here to some regard but I think your still caught up on intentionality? You are saying if the intention was not to get bad press, is that still a good thing to do? That somehow anonymity here could of resolved the issue of wanting to censors oneself? I think this is a difficult line to walk. It's hard to judge someones intentions and you have to take them at face value. The person who does good to get into Heaven does not gain as much in Heaven as the person who does good not carrying where they shall find their eternal body -- in this way, it is finality that is the Judge. I do not wish to judge people's intentions but it seems inarguable that peoples intentions have an impact, "a soul", with respect to what they are making.
They already do. There was a signal processing library who had the phrase "retard the signal strength" in the readme and github asked them to change it. There is literally an employee at github who goes around and harasses developers based on their vocabulary. That is something they pay for. The author removed the library from Github and canceled his account.
That wasn't really the point though.
It's like many other large, open source software project. If you're not familiar with the concepts of open source, I recommend reading up. Some languages are open, some are closed. There are different governance models, but broadly speaking, open-source languages have the same workflow: a well-defined way of making and discussing proposals for the language, a repository anyone can submit changes to, and some quality control/ gating procedure which makes sure the changes are based on a mature proposal, work as intended, and keep the quality of the codebase high.

To be pedantic there is a HUGE difference between "sensored" and "censored", it's not just a misspelling.
&gt; The threat of negative consequence amounts to censorship. No it doesn't. An authority prohibiting or punishing the publishing of certain content is censorship. &gt; If the consequence was "the police will put you in jail" would you call it censorship? Yes, because there is an *authority* who is making the decision. That's what makes something censorship. It doesn't have to be the government. YouTube certainly censors the content on their platform. More practically, most censorship takes the form of preventing publishing, not punishing after the fact (because you're a pretty bad censor if you let things get published you don't want published). But **authority**- that's the key difference. You can't say, "But people will be mean to me if I act like an asshole," and call that "censorship". It makes you look like, well, an *asshole*. &gt; The result is still that you can't say something you want to say, which is why it is censorship. But you *can say it*! Literally no one is going to stop you. But then they're going to use *their own* free speech to respond. Like, literally, you're arguing **for** censorship, by suggesting that people shouldn't be allowed to say mean things if they don't like what you said. *That's actual* censorship. People are free to react to what you say. And if you don't like their reactions, then you should a) find a receptive audience, or b) re-evaluate what you're saying, or c) double down because you are so committed to the truth of your statement. Like, shit, I run a blog. Sometimes the commenters insult my articles. By your logic, those negative consequences are "censorship". That is a dumbfuck thing to say.
&gt; So it's like Wikipedia (ish)? Wikipedia doesn't really have a review process or an enhancement process for articles, so I wouldn't say it's like that at all. It's a fairly standard large open source software project process. Documentation has the least stringent review process; in general if it's overall better, even if it's not quite right, it gets approved. Regarding a bug fix, you'd better conform to the style and write a good patch. Regarding enhancements, if you just push a new feature without approval/discussion, it won't be accepted. &gt; Does the same thing is true for other languages or the process varies and depends on who own the particular language? Depends on the language. The steering council concept is new to python (Python used to have a BDFL or benevolent dictator for life), but other languages have it.
How can you 3D print a gun without code, duh!
Github has been policing things for morality for a while now. Not just "this is malware" but "this contains mean words". In fact I don't even know about the malware, I've only heard of them policing things for cultural reasons.
&gt; good reporting at regular intervals Haha... what utopia do you live in? I completely agree with you. For fixing the ecology of the planet there are these same choices: eco-socalism and eco-facism... Between the two, which do you think is more likely to take root in the world? Education and knowledge dissemination is perhaps in some of the worst states possible in the western world when you consider people are getting their news and voting preferences from Facebook.

Most valid point in this discussion of fake CP. The only way the algorithm would get better is by seeing real CP... My first thought is this would drive pedos to improve the program and likewise commit such acts.
Like lots of machine learning code it's written in Python.
I suppose I think that there are legitimate authorities and self-appointed ones, and the latter can be a disorganised group of people and still affect censorship. Also, if negative consequences are "organic" so to speak, that is, how the person would have responded naturally if they were not thinking (subconsciously or otherwise) about the signals they are sending, then I wouldn't call it censorship either. But when responses are *engineered* to discourage behaviour, I'd like to call them censorship regardless of whether the authority is legitimate. If someone has the power to make me shut up because the consequences they can create for me are enough to change my behaviour, and they choose to use it, then they have made themselves an authority, even if it is illegitimate (i.e. without my consent).
Yes. Facebook should die. Twitter should die. Reddit should be rebuilt. First suggestion, limit downvotes to be equivalent to a person upvotes or likewise add rules to try to encourage less lurking in some subs. There are all kinds of social rules we could add to fix issues but it would require us to actually be thinking about fixing the issues... and then you know doing it. &gt; What I don't want is a bunch of billionaires deciding what we can and can't publish. Right. That's why democracy should work via us debating it... but I tell you who isn't having a good thorough discussion on this... our representatives. I mean at the end of the day the solution to the modern problems are either we consensually build back up a democratic framework or we let authoritarian approaches take root. However, if we want change instead of stagnicity, then one of these has to start moving forward...
Maybe directory is the wrong word for it. But if you read the section towards the end, Guido has Pronounced [1] that relative imports will use leading dots. A single leading dot indicates a relative import, starting with the current package. Two or more leading dots give a relative import to the parent(s) of the current package, one level per dot after the first. Here's a sample package layout: package/ __init__.py subpackage1/ __init__.py moduleX.py moduleY.py subpackage2/ __init__.py moduleZ.py moduleA.py Assuming that the current file is either moduleX.py or subpackage1/__init__.py, following are correct usages of the new syntax: from .moduleY import spam from .moduleY import spam as ham from . import moduleY from ..subpackage1 import moduleY from ..subpackage2.moduleZ import eggs from ..moduleA import foo from ...package import bar from ...sys import path Note that while that last case is legal, it is certainly discouraged ("insane" was the word Guido used).
I think you have to be a lot more specific in order to have a comment that is meaningful
Yeah, I wasn't trying to describe an arms race but ultimately that's what it is. I guess the point I'm really trying to make is that if you have something that's dangerous, you would rather have a danger that you have more information about than one that you have less information about.
Our society is descending down a rabbit hole. Where it goes, nobody knows. . .
We live in a world where people still fall for Nigerian prince scams. Making a "Nigerian prince kit" widely available probably wouldn't change that fact. And even when we do know an image is fake, it can still hurt. We are not dispassionate creatures of perfect logic.
Questions 1. Will this revert to a older version of chrome or leave it alone and ONLY delete the history and nothing else? 2. Will this allow me to delete the history from "Beginning of time" If so I will use this at work ASAP!
I think I agree at a personal level but it's kind of like the difference between theory and practice, "in theory they are the same". The information has to utilized. Information like mathematics is kind of valueless. It's cool mathematicians are just making up cool maths but generally speaking we don't need to teach everyone the mathematics of manifolds even though this is one of the most accurate explanation of space-time relative to our scales. When all things are equal, I agree with you but the reality is the world is not equal, there are actors that have more desire to do harm and actors that have little desire to mitigate risk. I am not sure we have statistics on these ecosystems and any good statement about the nature of these groups to come to an conclusive statement that freedom of information is paramount in the sense of a healthy society. It seems to me there needs to be a balance but I am not sure on any such "solution", just that the arms race can be wasteful. To tie this into to a great problem (because I don't believe anything is mutually exclusive), this is the same issue of "hate speech". At what point in a debate, does a speakers lack of candor and offensiveness become disruptive of debate, discourse, understanding, and learning? We have no good answer for this and man is it really starting to rip our culture up. This being just another example of the manifestation of a lack of having any kind of substantial "ethos" be it within America or modern Software Development.

This isn't true of GANs (The technology behind this). I doubt there's a way to 100% tell using a computer program if a GAN is real or not since the way they are trained is by fooling a program which determines if it's real or not.

Sory, mis traslated, i'm a brasilian. Noteped i think
This is an oddly written function,. Your confusion is reasonable. Let’s start with array. This is a set of integers, and the pairs function puts each integer into array after checking it. What’s the point? To ensure that each pair of numbers is only counted once. Note that with the given example (k=2), the pair of numbers (5, 3) could be satisfied twice: once upon encountering 5 (as i) and finding that i-k (5-2 = 3) is an integer in arr, and once upon encountering 3 (as i) and finding that i+k (3+2 = 5) is also an integer in arr. The use of array is intended to prevent double counting by transferring integers from arr to array, one at a time, and only counting each of them once. And yet, this is a fix to a problem *based on a logical error in the code*: the insistence on checking both i+k and i-k. If it only had one of those (either one!), and checked only against the contents of arr, then the whole function succeeds. No need to mess with array at all. Now, you might think that array is used to prevent double-counting in case arr contains duplicates of integers. For instance: if arr = [3, 3, 5], iterating twice might have caused it to return 2 instead of 1. That example is prevented by the use of array, since 3 only goes into array (as a set) once. And yet - the use of array doesn’t actually succeed in preventing that problem. If arr = [5, 3, 3], then the code returns 2 anyway. By eliminating this problem in only half of the cases, the “fix” has not only made the code more complex but inconsistent: the result varies based on the *order* of elements, which should not happen. Bottom line: This is not good code to solve this problem. There are dozens of other ways of doing it more succinctly, readably, and correctly. For instance: return sum(list([1 for x in arr if x + k in arr else 0])) I can’t test it, I think that this one line of code will probably return the right answer.

I'm surprised no one use Jupyter. For Python programming video, I use Jupyter notebook. Use markdown for notes, use code cell to follow the actual coding.
It only contains unique elements from arr that have been tested by the function. It is intended to provide backward-only testing as it iterates over arr. It actually sucks at that task for various reasons, but the idea is clear, at least.
Consider that running it with k=2, arr=[3, 3, 5] returns 1, but running it with k=2, arr=[5, 3, 3] returns 2. That should never occur.
O no! Thanks for bringing this to my attention and sorry for the inconvenience. I'm going to try and solve this right away. &amp;#x200B; Until I solve that, check out the github ([https://github.com/great-expectations/great\_expectations](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations)) and our docs ([http://docs.greatexpectations.io/en/latest/](http://docs.greatexpectations.io/en/latest/)) which seems to not be blocked.
Probably not within seconds but a good start would be scrape the page, e.g. with beautifulsoup (python), extract the data (either with beautifulsoup or regex) and export to excel (with pandas). It it is a large online shop they probably have some mechanism against scraping, like captchas or ip blocks, which you need to handle. This can be done with rotating proxies, timers in your script and proper browser headers while scraping. Note that scraping a website may violate their terms of use.
read the `tweepy` and `praw` modules' docs and look up tutorials, then write some code. people will help you if you get stuck, but they won't start it for you.

I tackled this same problem before using the Selenium package. It has a bit of a learning curve but is well worth it if you are trying to script interactions in a web browser. For example, once the basic set-up code is in place this is all it takes to find and click the Remove button on each ad sponsor: test = driver.find_elements_by_xpath('//*[@data-tooltip- content="Hide all ads from this advertiser"]') for x in test: x.click() The full code with some barebones comments: # Selenium Imports from selenium import webdriver from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By # Set the location of the Firefox/Chrome executable downloaded [from here](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html#drivers) driverPath = r'C:\Users\[username]\Documents\Selenium\geckodriver.exe' # I used Firefox ("geckodriver"), so calling the associated web driver # This launches the remote-controlled browser session driver = webdriver.Firefox(executable_path=driverPath) # Maximize the window, go to the Facebook ad page driver.maximize_window() driver.get('https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=ad_settings_screen') # Find all the elements on the page with the HTML attribute "data-tooltip-content" where the value equals "Hide all ads from this advertiser" test = driver.find_elements_by_xpath('//*[@data-tooltip-content="Hide all ads from this advertiser"]') # For each element found click the button for x in test: x.click() # Close the session and browser driver.quit() driver.close() https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/ In this example you would log-in manually once you tell the browser to load the Facebook page, and then it can go through and click all the buttons for you. You could script the login as well but I didn't bother since I run this ad-hoc. You may also run into an issue of another page element being "on top" of a Remove button you want to click. In my case the page footer was getting in the way sometimes, so I used the Selenium "execute_script" command to insert Javascript that would remove the offending element before I start. I don't have the code for that but you can insert Javascript with: driver.execute_script("alert('Hey! It works!');")
Why would you care anyway if it's your personal machine anyway lol.
reading the documentation and following tutorials is the best way to get some! head over the the /r/learnpython/wiki for some great beginner resources
Interesting questions. Not sure why you are being downvoted lol.
thanks
Some considerations: 1. **How many domains?** Websites will differ in their HTML. You would have to make a parser for each website you want to scrape. 2. **Do any of your websites have an API you can use?** If a website has an API, it is best to use it. Check what fields are you able to extract. It will make you life easier than scraping. Plus, websites don't like being scraped. 3. **Are any of the websites rendered by javascript?** If so, you will need to use a tool like `selenium` or `scrapy-splash` to render the javascript and then get the HTML code. A library like `requests` will not be able to interact with the javascript. 4. **Does the website state that they do not want to be scraped?** Look into the websites **robots.txt.** This will show you the locations in the website that should not be touched by a crawler. Anything that is not specified there is mostly fair game. Fair game though doesn't mean send 100k requests per second, you don't want to DoS them. 5. **Spoof you user-agent**: The user-agent identifies how you are accessing the website. Safari, Mozilla, Chrome? Mobile? Computer? Google around and list a list of user-agents. 6. **Go to Inspect** **click on Network:** Look at the **Request Header**. This is what your browser is sending the websites server, basically specifying what info it wants. Replicate the header. Here is where you would also add a random user-agent per request. Hopefully that was helpful.
this doesnt have a money purpose. My friend get this info to check the prices and compare with the prices of his company. I think the shop in question doesnt have this protection. Because i try scrapping all page and i can get all info and display in my command line.

Well this would be a money purpose :). If you can scrape it easily it should be straightforward to export the info in an excel sheet. However, if you plan to scrape multiple pages from that shop it's better to implement an timer of a few seconds before scraping the next page. It would be pretty easy for a shop to detect if someone generates multiple requests per second, since it would be more than a human could generate

I started with Atom and really liked it so I can vouch for that! Lots of helpful add-ons (which are free) and easy colour schemes to help you learn what's going on a little easier. I switched to Sublime though after a while which for me runs a lot quicker once you've got a few folders of projects you're working on. I highly rate this, although perhaps not as user friendly initially as atom. Good luck and hope you enjoy the courses!

Is that so? This is the only incident I've found regarding github and the word "retard" https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9966118 The code actually used retard as an insult, and not to mean "delay" "WebM for Retards" https://github.com/nixxquality/WebMConverter/commit/c1ac0baac06fa7175677a4a1bf65860a84708d67 Maybe there is another incident you are referring to.
I appreciate that! I've heard about sublime as well. Heard it's faster and runs easier, less memory consumption. Only issue is I'm looking for the one stop shop. I've heard a lot of people say memory is why they jumped ship from one or the other to sublime but I should be able to run either without an issue. So then I come back to which one of these is going to have everything I need and which one will be best for me to learn now and forever.

&gt; I don't see 1) on the same scale of harm as actually sexually, physically and mentally abusing children. Nowhere near, so a tech which swaps one for the other is not doing harm IMHO, but then I've said that in another comment and I'm getting down votes, so maybe others don't share that opinion. I agree it's not the same as physically abusing a child. However, snapping a photo of naked children is also not necessarily physically or mentally abusive, but sharing it can still be sexual abuse in many contexts. So can fake images of them naked. We've already seen people traumatized by fake nudes made with their face. Now it's that, only they are 6 years old in the photo instead of an adult. So yes, it's not rape, but it can still be quite harmful. I mean imagine when these output images are more convincing. Of course the subject of said fake photos can be legitimately victimized by their use.
Generating a fake CP image as a "lesser of two evils" is frankly abhorrent. Completely the wrong mentality with which to go about addressing CP. Technology and its advances should be welcome in addressing the problem: in so far as *catching* *out* and *shutting down* pedophile rings, the use of big data to identify potential pedophile, etc. Additionally, advances in our understanding of the psychology of the pedophile, and our criminal justice system, would be further steps forward in attacking CP head on. 1) Should DN software be used to create a CP image from an existing image of a child, it is still a horrific assault to that child, and indeed human being's dignity, an infringement of their human rights. 2) Even if the software is used on a potential fake image of a non-existent child, it increases circulation of CP further, could create further demand for this perversity, normalises it etc etc. I mean seriously, how can we expect to live in a society in which producing fake CP is okay? The argument that it is somehow lesser than two evils, because it doesn't directly traumatise a child, is superficial - who knows what the consequences of the ability to generate fake CP could be? I would hate to live in a world where this is okayed.
This is a tool that is literally only for making fake nudes of people. That's the only thing it does. This isn't like banning hammers because one was used in a murder. This is like banning nerve gas because there's literally no use for it other than causing harm. Its true that once something is out there it can't be gotten rid of but Github doesn't have to be a part of that.
1) Although it is fake, it almost definitely would act as a gateway onto further crimes and people with this interest would most certainly be treated with high levels of suspicion. For crying out loud, the imagery could act as a perverse form of inspiration. 2) Consider the instance of the pedophile who views images but did not make them themselves, and hasn't physically harmed a child themselves. Did the person make the image/ cause harm to an actual child? No, that was someone else's doing, but we know that viewing and circulating such imagery is inherently disgusting.
I'm not exactly sure what you mean but maybe use `str.splitlines()` and then `str.split()`. Maybe not the prettiest way but definitely gets the job done.
Right, and aren't they trained off sets of existing faces?... This would imply you'd need real CP to train it initially.
I have been learning Python for 3 days and I'm pretty new to programming overall. I made a liquid volume convertor which uses basic stuff like if, input, float and stuff like that. It converts almost every metric system volume unit to any unit you choose. And it works in cmd... Also what I did is not probably the most elegant solution cuz there is about 30 lines of "if" statements and number of those increases exponentially as you add more units of volume to convert (because those lines of "if" statements contain every combination of units user can choose XD )... But it works! &amp;#x200B; Any ideas or pro tips that could help me? I would truly appreciate it since I am a complete beginner.
1. this belongs to r/learnpython, 2. storing usernames and passwords in this format: &amp;#8203; username: user123 password: password123 doesn't seem like that good idea, but sure it might work, it would be better idea to store them as JSON or CSV. use .read() to read file, .split("\\n") to split tect into lines, read first 2 lines for both of them split on space, which is char separating useless text with actual value, and you are done
Not really what I meant :\ The idea is to first type in your username and password, the login information is stored in the txt file. I want to use the information in the txt file to make a log in system, Example: If username (what you input later to log in) == username: (what is stored in the txt file) Print (”welcome!”)
what is output the realistic level from 0 to 10?
Not exactly. You could train it off images of adults, but then input images of children at inference time. It obviously isn't going to generalize and understand what a child's body looks like, so it is never going to generate realistic images w/o realistic training data.
pretty basic
As soon as this tool is banned others will come. There will come tools that are not specific to nudes but you can use them in that way. Then it becomes a grayscale and where do you draw the line? If I want to make fake nudes privately I think I should be able to do so. If i distribute them then I should be prosecuted. P.s. I dont personally to make fake nudes because I'm happy with the real nudes available online. A fake celeb nude will not do anything for me because I will know it is fake. As a matter of fact fake nudes might actually make real nudes of celebrities less interesting because no one can know if they are fake or not or that the internet will be flooded with so many fake nudes that there will be no interest for real or fake nudes anymore.
why do you think this code is usefull and shouldn't be banned from github?
Great post except the McDonald's analogy falls flat to me. It's more like an Indian restaurant not serving beef - according to their values to serve beef to their customers is immoral. They don't buy beef from beef suppliers and they wouldn't take it if they were paid for it. They are not obligated to sell or not sell beef just because some people think it's okay to eat. They aren't making a judgement about people's choices, but about a specific product and their own relation to it. GitHub is in some degree responsible, legally and morally, for the content it allows on its platform. Free speech is one thing, but you can't force others to be a platform for speech they don't believe in or want to support. If someone hosts a git server and posts a link around the web that people can clone this code from them, GitHub and anyone else won't even try to do anything about it. Only of the content is deemed illegal will last enforcement step in.
I'm not really sure why you want to do this for 100 tables. Are they all the same structure? This is common practice in ETL, checking for differences in the source and destination table. In SQL, we typically write an update or insert statement on the destination table, by joining the two tables on the primary key, and finding differences in data with a checksum or hash. Checksum and hash are functions that wrap around a combination of columns and apply a value to that combination. So whenever you have an equality between the primary keys and an inequality in the hash value, you know there is a difference in the two tables.

What I think is the best is to give yourself a goal. Not too big one but a goal you don't know exactly how to achieve. Once a problem comes up just google it and try to solve it. It will be probably hard and time consuming, maybe frustrating to achieve a goal you don't know how to achieve but you will learn a lot. That's my way. That's what I did today after watching few basics tutorials. I programmed a basic convertor of volume units (with a bunch of very inelegant lines of code ) a whole day which works in cmd... But I learned so much! (I started 2 days ago). Even though it was sometimes very frustrating it feels good and I'm honestly having fun. Good luck in learning Python and have fun too!

Once he gets that done it can be encoded with py-Enigma, I really like cryptography and it's pretty easy to get going or something more basic like base64
I'm new to all this. Could you go into further detail?
Seems like you didn't try very hard: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12232250
You never know how it will be used and what for. Maybe somebody will take a look at the code and discover how to detect breastcancer just looking at some pictures. What if people where saying it's an art work? Do you forbidden Photoshop for doing the exact same thing?
I watch. Then rewatch and attempt to do the same thing, only changing small parts to make sure I actually understood it. I like to comment my code excessively when learning something new. Follow up with pen and paper for some very high level notes, like "python - flask is good for simple websites". Or, "dont forget to start counting at 0, not 1". With this approach, I spend more time doing, with a little bit of a summary at the end to make sure I wasn't moving so fast I forget everything.
The user pulled it - not MS
Passwords should not be encrpyed using symetric keys, they should be hashed (and salted). Also base64 is a encoding scheme, not a encryption method.
Yeah I know..... I'm passing on some ideas the guy is learning python...
I don’t. I think it’s bad and shouldn’t exist. I don’t know why that’s an unpopular opinion.
[https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/developer-utilities/twitter-libraries.html](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/developer-utilities/twitter-libraries.html) &amp;#x200B; there are some twitter APIs wrote with python in this link, you can pick one, read its documentation and search for some tutorials. You can call me on chat if you have any doubts or need help
so do I
Seems like it would just be easier to stop caring about nudes.
If you want to get every word with a length of 5, just use the `len` function on the string and check if the output equals 5. ``` words_length_five = [] for word in words: # ... ``` You can do this in a list comprehension. If the list is massive, you could look into something called generators as well. To get the number of words with length 5, use the `len` function again on the `length_five` variable.
Okay I really don't see the difficulty here other than stringing a few basics together. Is the txt file supposed to be some kind of database?
Sorry for formatting, I am on my phone.
Yes
the simplest solution is to use a for loop along with an if statment, like this ``` newlist = [] for word in largelist: if len(word) &gt;= 5: newlist.append(word) ``` now you have the `newlist` list populated with words 5 characters long or more Another way or archieve this is using list comprehensions `newlist = [w for w in largelist if len(w) &gt;= 5]`
AHH, I see. I've been experimenting with some opengl packages like pyqtgraph which has been quite good and vispy which looks awesome because soon they will add higher level functions so I don't really need to learn opengl lol. But yeah good to know pygame has such capabilities.
Imho, you should try Heroku. It has a great tutorial for beginners. Since you want to run your script at a specific time - you can use a task scheduler in Heroku. And it's all free!
Knowing how to use profilers, numpy,pandas, scipy and builtin functions would be a good start.
People were making fake versions with malware. I'm a little concerned that with this source removed, the risk of that has increased again.
I would fake a nude photo of Rex Tillerson.
Android = java
GIMP is hosted on GNOME's GitLab
Not going to lie. I had no interest in this project beforehand. Now I really want to find this source code. Streisand 1 - My Free Time - 0.
can someone please help me, i am a beginner,sorry about this but i dont lnw where to post this, im having a problem with openpyxl on pycharm,this is my code : import openpyxl as xl wb = xl.load\_workbook('transactions.xlsx') sheet = wb\['Sheet1'\] cell = sheet.cell(1, 1) print(cell.value) simple,right ? yet i get this error : ("Worksheet {0} does not exist.".format(key)) and i dont know what to do.

Before deep nudes: a school student finds a video on porn hub of their teacher from before she started teaching. The school and parents find out. She gets fired. After deep nudes: student finds video. School assumes it was faked by a student. The teacher keeps her job. Just last month someone claimed to have used facial recognition tools to match amateur porn hub videos to public Facebook profiles, for hundreds of thousands of women. Videos people thought would remain anonymous are just starting to come back and haunt people. But this technology is a get-out-of-jail-free card.
&gt;No one uses linked lists for anything, ever, because of their horrifying cache locality. All the implementations of CL I use actually *do* use linked lists because rest/cdr/tail-ing a list is O(1).
Jupyter Notebook is an interactive environment that allows you to execute code and use markdown for document. It's sort of living &amp; breathing document tool. I use it for most of my note taking when it comes to programming videos.

The social downside is really no different to Photoshop. This tool doesn't do anything you can't do with Photoshop. (As a student a decade ago, I saw an image of a female peer doing something *very* explicit. But I knew it was a photoshopped image, so her reputation was unharmed.) We as a society have learned to question the authenticity of images before. We'll do it again. Life will go on.
So, basically Java is dying?
Thank you
Thank you
&gt; I've heard about PyCharm, even went as far as to download it because of the autocomplete, active debugging, etc. The list goes on. However, Udacity recommends Atom and a lot of people say Atom is beginner friendly. For python you'd be hard-pressed to find a better out of the box IDE than PyCharm. &gt; As a brand new programmer, I am just trying to make the most well-informed decision possible. If you understand the material and know what you're doing, it won't matter what you use to write the code. A guy I graduated with spent all four years of CS writing all his code in nano. Conversely, when I was TA'ing I had students that only ever used an IDE and come test time they didn't know what to do because pen and paper don't autocomplete or tell them the number and order of arguments. If you can't do it on paper for a test, you won't be able to do it on a whiteboard for a job interview. Though I'd really like those kind of interviews to go the way of the dodo. So my advice is that it won't really matter what you use as long as you make sure you understand what you're doing and don't let any tool become a crutch. For pure python projects PyCharm is great, but I've heard a lot of people praising Atom, too.
 only 3 days ago. [https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/c9kneu/deepnude\_is\_opensource\_now/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/c9kneu/deepnude_is_opensource_now/)
Kotlin these days
You're right though, we should stop wearing clothes (when not welding or cooking bacon). I've been saying this my whole life but no one agrees
So you make a good point. I love the argument about if you can't do it on a whiteboard then the ide is more of a crutch than a help... Honestly torn. I half believe I'd take the step to understand why my code isn't working but at the same time I can see myself getting lazy, letting PyCharm autocomplete, and moving on without a second thought... As far as the platforms go though, are they different? Is there any reason why I would or wouldn't use one over the other?
trying to register for a university class on algorithms. As a self-taught programmer who has built software suites for restaurants (well just one... my girlfriend's), I am still terribly inept when it comes to anything theoretical. But apparently they test for that stuff on job interviews.
But it was Python using pytorch and open-cv
What next GIMP, Blender?
i'm unsurprised github would make such a move, though i can say with certainty that if i was the author, my life's goal would now be to disseminate it as far and wide as possible.
Not really. I was trying python again since I haven't used it in a long time and I found asking myself this question.
Thank you for the answers and directions.
Cheers mate, I really appreciate it!
the grep approach is way simpler. If you wanted the pandas way to do it you can use apply: &amp;#x200B; import pandas as pd # create df with 1 dummy column a = ['.', 'xz', 'sdf.3'] df = pd.DataFrame(a, columns=['test']) print('before replacing . with ""') print(df.head()) # replace . using apply df.test = df.test.apply(lambda x: x.replace('.', '')) print('after replacement') print(df.head())
I posted &amp; re-read and noticed I didn't reply...rather than a phantom edit here is what you want - use regex=False for contains &amp; \~ to get not contain... import pandas as pd # create df with 1 dummy column a = ['.', 'xz', 'sdf.3'] df = pd.DataFrame(a, columns=['test']) filtered_df = df[~df.test.str.contains('.',regex=False)]
Just a quick thought: it would be cool to have complete chemical names in there too for those that are a little chemical knowledge challanged ;)
I've always thought the official docs were fantastic, and that others generally agreed. What are you looking for?
Knowledge bomb
another option: newlist = list(filter(lambda x: len(x) &gt;= 5, oldlist)) &amp;#x200B; The link below explains Filter, if you're not familiar. [https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/filter](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/filter)
Thank you so much for sharing the detailed advice!
I keep getting the following exception if I replace example.png with any other png. Anyone else? Is that not the right way to use it on a different file? I'm not wanting to use it for evil, I just wanna see what all the fuss is about - the example isn't even very convincing. ``` Traceback (most recent call last): File "main.py", line 58, in &lt;module&gt; main() File "main.py", line 48, in main result = process(image, gpu_id) File "&lt;redacted&gt;/easydeepnude/src/cli/run.py", line 165, in process maskref = create_maskref(mask, correct) File "&lt;redacted&gt;/easydeepnude/src/cli/opencv_transform/mask_to_maskref.py", line 37, in create_maskref res1 = cv2.bitwise_and(cv_correct, cv_correct, mask = green_mask_inv) cv2.error: OpenCV(4.1.0) /build/opencv/src/opencv-4.1.0/modules/core/src/arithm.cpp:245: error: (-215:Assertion failed) (mtype == CV_8U || mtype == CV_8S) &amp;&amp; _mask.sameSize(*psrc1) in function 'binary_op' ``` Same thing occurs in both the official and 'easydeepnude' versions of the code.
Github cares this much about content on their site, but won't give me back my account with my own projects on it because I used an old work email address that i no longer have access to and can't use the 2fa.. Even though my profile has my actual photo on it and I sent them a picture of my driver's license and offered up other identifying information/evidence. Fuck github
Maybe just a nit pick.....Just looks old and not up to todays presentation standards lol. Maybe they just don't have the money I don't know ;) While it looks ok substance wise It's just an eye sore to look at for me. ymmv of curse.
Yes, it's an upvoted [syntax error](https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0328/): &gt; Relative imports must always use `from &lt;&gt; import`; `import &lt;&gt;` is always absolute.
While searching around for DeepNude and more information behind it I came across https://grabthenudes.com it seems like they have improved the application and releasing updates for it. Curious what that will turn out to
I’ve always thought Python had excellent documentation. If you want some examples of bad documentation, you should check out Oracle.
&gt;so it is never going to generate realistic images w/o realistic training data. That's exactly what I'm saying. Maybe you could get a half-decent model trained off legal jailbait models, but I dont think it'd be good enough to seriously put a dent in CP circulation. They'd just take the same network and train it on the actual thing.
And this is posted here why?
Don't even open the code. Open watermark.png in GIMP and cut the alpha
The watermark always has to be composited in afterwards, so anyone who has the code can just turn it off. You could maybe train the network to integrate the watermark into the output, but it will make the result look worse and there isn't much point. Like DRM, it's just sort of an unsolvable problem. Certain black boxes can't exist if they have to run on hardware that your attacker owns.
Flask, usually with none of the "rest" extensions because they really tend to just make your database model your API contract which is bad juju. Every once in a while, aiohttp. Though I started using this only for when I need to act as a gateway for multiple services (eg given an input, fetch two sources).

This is what I use at the moment. Plain old flask without any random bloat. The only "extension" I use is the Flask-SQLAlchemy which I think is alright (read through the source code, literally a 1 .py file wrapper) &amp;#x200B; I will check out aiohttp and starlette soon. Do you notice anything incrementally different in performance when using aiohttp vs flask?
I did not know about this, definitely will check this out. Thanks
Thanks, will check this out when evaluating starlette
Great to hear flask is still a contender. Do you notice anything substantial in Elixir/Phoenix vs Flask? I've read that due to the Global Interpreter Lock true concurrency isn't really achieved. Thoughts?
I like both, they are really different philosophies and coding styles though so pick whichever you like. If it's just a simple REST API I'd probably use Flask if speed wasn't a worry.
hmm, when I was learning about Django there was too much included. I wanted something very very minimal. Thanks for the suggestion though, I'm looking for more minimal frameworks that's why have been using Flask till now.
I wish my project gets big enough that speed becomes a worry :) :)
Not sure while you're getting downvoted, as the [their Acceptable Use Policy](https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-acceptable-use-policies) does prohibit things that contain "sexually obscene content". However, pretty much all the major git hosting solutions in some way are against sexual content; Github's just more enforced.
lol
So, you do have to pare down a bit of the boiler plate to do it, but I’d take that bet that I can write less Python using Django REST than it takes you to write the equivalent in Flask. Normally, Flask is the minimal choice, but truly not in this case. Unless by minimal, you mean something other than lines of code written.
......like Photoshop but automated?
Looks like a problem that can be solved with linear/integer programming. [PuLP](https://pythonhosted.org/PuLP/#) is a python library for that. If you are not fimiliar with linear programming it is probably to much to learn for a single project, but it is really useful for a lot of optimization problems, so you might be interested anyways

Right before 3.7.4 came out I got 3.7.3 :(
I'm curious to know what kind of updates will be available in the future. I hope they mean they will figure out how to successfully undress a broader range of photos. Like photos where women are not directly facing the camera, and photos shot from high and low angles (as many selfies are), and of course photos where women are wearing more clothing.
I tried signing up for their email notifications so I know when they make updates but every time I try to enter it it says an error occurred.
My program work! Thank you This program will run one time per week and scrap um subcategory of a website in this case "smartphones". You think he will have a problem for doing this scrap?
So now every 2 to 3 minutes, an image will be created on your computer, right?

If you know how it’s done you know that A) it’s possible and B) you can figure out how to create tools that will show when its been used. Those campaigns can be slowed or stopped by the spread of the truth and having the tools and knowledge available to make informed decisions is an important part of a free society. Large groups of people are going to believe stupid shit regardless of if you ban this, or promote this on every billboard on the face of the earth, so instead of leaving everyone else in the dark why don’t we work on finding ways to make this tool obsolete. (It’ll help if you can see how the thing works) Also, banning this from Github has done exactly nothing to prevent this from being developed. I haven’t tried, but I bet that within an hour I can find a place that is now hosting it/working on it. All this is done is make it harder for the people who want to work on beating it.
