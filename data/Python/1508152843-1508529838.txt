Thanks, noted. 
I actually use this pretty extensively as I like sticking to jsonapi. It's a great piece of work! I guess the only criticism is the doco but that seems to be the authors second language. 
I have found the problem. Its the user. Mine is set to root. Celery does not permit to be activated via root unless it is forced. I only had to change the user.
In my spare time, I like working with electricity data, particularly with an eye toward quantifying emissions from electricity generation. Electricity independent system operators (ISOs) and balancing authorities (BAs) often publish electricity generation data publicly. There are two groups working on these problems: * WattTime has an open source library, [pyiso](https://github.com/WattTime/pyiso) which produces electricity generation, load, import/export trade timeseries for a variety of ISOs/BAs. It power their [Impact API](http://explorer.watttime.org/) and is used in a variety of other projects. * Tomorrow Co. has an open source project, [Electricity Map](https://github.com/tmrowco/electricitymap) which is primarily an informational/educational outreach visualization available at https://www.electricitymap.org The Electricity Map codebase uses pyiso as its parser library for the United States, but has many additional parsers of their own. In my mind, both groups are helping people by trying to tackle the problem of emissions from electricity generation. Understanding the emissions in real-time can help connected devices response to emissions in real-time. WattTime's parent organization, The Rocky Mountain Institute, is calling this concept [Automated Emissions Reduction](https://www.rmi.org/news/catalyzing-market-automated-emissions-reduction/). That's what I work on in my spare time to help people and to keep my python skills sharp (as my day job is in C#).
I like the site design, what tech did you use to build the site? Also, the tutorial is super slick, how/ what did you make that with?
/u/sbt's a slacker. He needs to graduate already! ;-) (We went to grad school together. I wrote the forward for his book.)
I can't say much...I'm a returning student. I graduate this semester but it took ~6-7years to get here.
I would recommend that you start with Introduction to Statistical Learning with R (usually shortened as ISLR). A lot of people have adapted the examples to Python if you google a bit and it's an excellent book that hides just enough complexity to not be overwhelming. Plus, once you have a good understanding of all of it, you can either graduate to the more extensive version (Elements of Statistical Learning, usually shortened as ESL) for a more rigorous treatment of the same thing, or choose to go for something different like Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning. ISLR is free as a pdf and has a corresponding MOOC. ESL doesn't, but is also free on the author's website. Andrew Ng's coursera course is also good, but you should only consider it as a tasting session and use it to guide your independent research towards what you find interesting or to try to get some intuitive understanding of the algorithms as they are not really rigorous enough to be a complete course in themselves imho. However if you like them, Andrew also has his Stanford classes on Youtube (IIRC) and they are much tougher.
I think ISLR (Introduction to Statistical Learning with R) would be perfectly suited for you. You can find the pdf on the author's website. You can safely ignore the R part and try to do it with Python.
I’m working on a Crunchyroll queue scraper that integrates with an anime generator so you no longer have to agonize over what anime to watch. ^^
Just writing that function is playing with fire. Putting a decorator on it isn't the dangerous part.
I work in a job that requires no programming but lots of computer use. I write scripts to automate my workflow. People think I work really fast.. it's fun.
If you are interested in machine learning something that uses governmental open data to improve life at a local level. The Data Science for Social Good conference has [a list of existing projects](https://dssg.uchicago.edu/projects/) that you can draw inspiration from. 
Reading a large file and marshaling it into Python objects isn't free either. Bit of experimentation reveals no appreciable difference between loading the CSV to build the dict, and hard-coding the dict. And as the maintainer of [a different color-utility library](https://github.com/ubernostrum/webcolors/), I honestly just go for hard-coding the dict. Though I guess in this case since it's a bit larger there might be concerns about overloading syntax highlighters (a couple editors on my machine struggled with it when tweaking the files for the benchmark).

Any specific libraries or just keyboard/mouse? 
I do video editing so I use the OS and subprocess modules alot to batch encode files with ffmpeg. Recently I used a simple csv module to create subtitle files from spreadsheets. That in particular sped up my workflow enormously. Just for fun I've been playing with openCV and pyscenedetect which seem to have a lot of potential for what I do. 
P_P
&gt; By the mystical "guys that know this stuff". This is in line with "don't write your own crypto" or "the authors of framework X are better at Y than you". They authors of crypto libraries or popular frameworks obviously seceded by not following such silly baseless advice. uWSGI is probably a more experimental option than Gevent/FastCGI under nginx. 
Were you aware of `networkx`? It is quite well-used, and does [clique detection](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.9.1/reference/algorithms.clique.html).
But my question in about when there's a json file in your cwd and one in the directory where the script is located. What is used then?
Controlling a frontend from python backend code :D
This is more appropriate for /r/learnpython. Where exactly are you trying to put credentials into? A web site/app? A desktop app? What have you tried already?
Starting price $250. No thanks :)
If the json file is a viper configuration file, then it will take precedence over the one in the root folder. Simple :)
Do people actually pay $250 for this?
PyTorch
Try your hand at the [Blender Game Engine](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/game_engine/introduction.html)
Cheap for a corporate environment. I spent a few hours setting up the xlwings add-in. If this software does it in a few minutes and has comparable functionality, the $250 is worth it.
Direct link to the "getting started" article, with code and more info: [Python on ESP32 - Getting Started](https://www.zerynth.com/blog/python-on-esp32-getting-started/)
It certainly shouldn't take hours to set up PyXLL, and there's a lot more depth to it so depending on exactly what you need you might find you get to a point where if you're struggling to get done what you need to then pyxll might be worth a look. There is some overlap with xlwings, but for calling Python from Excel PyXLL has a lot more features and works very differently - it actually embeds Python in Excel, whereas xlwings runs an external process and relies on auto-generating VBA code. PyXLL doesn't provide a wrapper around the Excel COM API though, so there's a case for using them together (pyxll's xl_app function can return an xlwings Application object for the instance of Excel it's running in, as well as win32com and comtypes objects). This blog lists a few of the differences in features: https://www.pyxll.com/blog/tools-for-working-with-excel-and-python/
I havent tried anything. I have just finished the course and it does not have any reference to any libraries or things you can do with python. only basic understanding of the syntax. I would say i want to do both in the end. but for starters I want to do it on the web. For example I would like it to be able to comment this comment automatically. 
I don't see the value in this with pywin32 being able to access the Excel object model easily.
Why do you need to run pip install so much? I don't see your point... I think the main problem here is `Scripters` vs `OtherDevs` For scripters they only want a script that works globally in your OS For otherdevs they only want code that works well within the project 
You can get a long way with pywin32 to automate Excel tasks, and depending on the use case that can be a really good way to go. The difference is that PyXLL actually runs Python in Excel and allows you to write Excel worksheet functions, macros and menu items in Python, which you can't do with pywin32. You can create ribbons and do real time data using pywin32, but its far from straightforward - pyxll makes it pretty easy to do those too. You can use them both together (and there are examples showing how to do that) to do things like give a user a menu item, keyboard shortcut or macro to run a Python function that automates some task using pywin32, which wouldn't be possible with pywin32 on its own.
&gt; some way that doesn't take a lot of time Does that include dev time? The core questions are: - what means "similar", in this context? - is the result gradual ("A is more similar to B than A to C") or binary - is it a binary input operation (the similarity of A and B is solely determined by A and B)? Or does the corpus variation affect, how similar A and B are? - is it transitive? (if A is similar to B and B to C, does that say anything about A and C)? - How often new words are added to the corpus? Even calculating a cross correlation for 30 million words isn't that expensive if it doesn't have to be done in real time - Does the similarity change over time? - ... or when new words are added? If similarity is binary, transitive, and independent of the corpus, a reductive function like [SoundEx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex) can be calculated for each word independently, and similarity determined by comparing the results. A specific algorithm like SoundEx is locale sensitive, it works on English and similar languages, but is probably a disaster for many Asian languages. However, the principle remains. 
This is awesome. Thanks! 
Ok, I'm not going to crap on somebody's work and I wish you all the best with your business.
Introductory levels haha. I’d still like to watch what you all have going on to learn :)
I learned basics from CA and never use lambda since I havnt properly learned it. I should do some more learning.
&gt; corporate environment. Something I've given up arguing about on Reddit: Corporate Environments. Few to none of the comments seem to understand how they work. "Lol, just install Linux!" yeah. On my encrypted corporate laptop with a locked down bootloader. $250 is nothing. It's a rounding error. That's saving ~2 hours of engineering time over having to do something in VBA. Not to mention a product sold by a company so if something breaks we go "Your product broke, we paid for it. You fix it". I think we have some MATLAB toolboxes that are $25k, each. And they're still cheap for the tools they provide.
Half of this benifits police. 
Sure mate. Pm me your email in private
What can this do that pandas can't? 
natively integrate to excel
I need more beginner exercises like this since I'm new to programming in general. I'm doing codecadamy right now but really love when people give links to places like this. I've done some of codefights' arcade exercises but some exercises are beyond my level still. Is there any other resources like a ftp site that would contain a teacher's homework assignments for a intro to python/programming course? Cause that would be great. 
&gt; Recently I used a simple csv module to create subtitle files from spreadsheets. How so?
This is great! I will bookmark it. I really like two things: first, the progression from simple to more complex figures. Matplotlib's documentation has the tendency to give very complicated examples. Second I think it's great it spans several libraries.
Or use [Hug](http://hug.rest)
I think it is better to have the colors read from a csv. It keeps the .py file shorter increasing readability and also one would not have to scroll down alot to reach the main code.
Also check out [exercism.io](http://exercism.io). I used it to get my new developers up to speed in basic Python quickly.
Lol I started there too. Then went to codacademy.
xlwings should not take more than a few minutes to set up fully
we should be able to help: https://www.pythonanywhere.com/
I counted 5 related to policing, out of 50+ projects. That's hardly half.
What makes you think I run pip install more often than you do? Do you mean, why do I use pip install -e? Because I am developing modules that need to be installed. How do you even run your unit tests without getting a "relative import not allowed" if you don't have your module installed? You might want to add to your list developers who are working on an ecosystem of tools that a number of products rely on. This is a scale between "just in the folder of that project alone" and "globally". 
I'd give a go to practicepython.org. I learned so much thanks to that website
Check out some of the [best Python Machine Learning tutorials &amp; books](https://reactdom.com/blog/python-books). You might find something there useful and most of them are very new.
I lol'd at this. Gj
There's a lot to learn from [Jake Vanderplas](https://twitter.com/jakevdp/status/906901174728536066). He recently said: "Don't set out to "learn Python". Choose a problem you're interested in and learn to solve it with Python."
Reportlab is for generating PDFs. It has no ability to edit existing ones - filling forms is a pro (commercial license) feature. 
There looks to be some sort of strange compatibility issue going on, or so I think. I'm pretty sure that 'Union' is part of the core Python libraries. My best advice is to simply make sure you're on the latest version of PRAW to confirm compatibility with Python 3.6.
Good resource! Thanks!
You could always put it in a separate Python file and import. Same performance, and doesn't clutter things up. My webcolors library periodically regenerates its color mappings by automated extraction from the HTML/CSS specs, and I've thought about putting them in a separate file just to make that process easier.
r/dailyprogrammer for those who are looking for more challenges.
I don't really know if I'd recommend any Python static blog generators but I've been using `hugo` for my own personal blog and it's worked out great. http://gohugo.io/
So if I happen to sit in another projects root folder this will possibly load the wrong config file, is that what you're implying?
It's not mine, it's from a guy named Richard Jarvis. [Here] (https://github.com/jarvisteach/jarvisteach.github.io) is the source of his webpage.
I don't think you understand how this works. This is not some complicated system. If you sit at another project's root folder, it will load it's correct configuration. Can you explain in more detail what specially are you confused about ?
I also work in a job that doesn't require programming knowledge. It is pretty fun to appear as if you are crazy fast or almost magic by scripting some repetitive task. I recently needed to create list of all calendar events from the previous day and needed to do it for several days in a row. I thought, I could do this the boring way or the fun DRY way. I [scripted it](http://scriptingwithpython.com/pull-a-list-of-yesterdays-google-calendar-events/) using the [Google API client](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/quickstart/python) and the built-in [csv module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html).
Python 2.7 is a decent language. It was perfectly suitable for beginners when it first appeared. It still isn't the worst possible choice. However, I agree with you. Today, learning Python 2.7 without knowing 3.x will be a very confusing experience for a beginner, even more confusing if it is Jython and he doesn't know Java.
I have 2 completely separate projects, A and B. I sit in root folder of A and try to run project B, what happens?
It will run the configuration of project B :)
&gt; That's saving ~2 hours of engineering time over having to do something in VBA I hate VBA. We've got systems that are screwed up royally because someone wrote a shit ton of VBA that relied on some sort of Sharepoint interface to a "database" that is is now broken because recent versions of Office don't work with our sharepoint version, and nobody budgeted for upgrading sharepoint. (because you can't just 'upgrade' sharepoint, it's an entire new server buildout) 
Why bother? There are too many courses available where you can try-before-you-buy; where you can see the open-source contributions of the trainers rather than this ad. I already know Python, I know that some teach Python when their main language is not Python. Some teach a course that starts leading you astray by not being *pythonic* from the outset. I am not saying that this is such a course, It is just that those in the Python community who know the language, can't give their opinion on it, or a part of it. 
I'm a big fan of this approach. For me, this method of learning is what really fosters a deep understanding.
You might be missing the point - that allows you to build embedded toolsets right into excel. For the corporate environment this means you can have analytic 'buttons' right in your excel ribbon for people that aren't tech savvy, and it doesn't require them to alter their workflow. One stop for everything they're doing. It's not all that different than how the finance teams at my company interact with the DB backends through excel plugins.
I once maintained a machine that had VBA running a production line. It had hooks into Matlab, Oracle, etc. But the PhD that knew the math only knew VBA and it went from R&amp;D Prototype to Production largely unchanged. It was the one time in my ~11 years in industry that when I dialed the IT help system I got to press the "Press One if this issue is impacting production." My 6mo project was migrating from VBA to Oracle stored procedures. If Python was back then where it is now it would have been 4 weeks at most. Also, Fuck Sharepoint. Seriously. Let me not count the number of times I've accidentally not checked in the right document, checked out a document for too long not knowing it. GitLab with Markdown is so much faster for any stuff I create. All my peers are like "How do you update those documents so fast". BECAUSE I'M NOT DEALING WITH SHAREPOINT.
I'll use [lektor](getlektor.com) for my blog. Github seems to promote Jekyll as static generator but that one isnt Python. 
Try /r/learnpython. Be sure to show them any code you have ([formatted for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin) and describe where you are stuck. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using.

ok, thanks 
My way to develop with python is quite unusual... I have a docker container and I install all the dependencies in a vendor folder inside of the project, everything is lock to a X.X.* version and I usually run the pip install when I start the project and probably never again... my CI is responsible to tell me when a test fails or something breaks or if a minor update breaks the compatibility so I don't care what is outside of my project On my raspberry pi i use it globally and as long as work I don't care about anything at all... I don't expect Python supports this way to develop but I think is the most agnostic way and is very isolated so I can find the issues straight away...
He's not importing `Union`, ctypes is. What's odd is that `import union` looks like it worked.
Google is still mostly Python 2.7, so without even looking at the link, I'll downvote and report as spam. 
Pelican https://github.com/getpelican/pelican
I went for Hugo as well. I tried Lektor for a while but didn't get on with it.
Yeah, I think quilt only supports tabular data at this point. Another idea: have you seen Frictionless Data? http://frictionlessdata.io/data-packages/ It's an interesting spec for doing the kind of thing you have in mind. I have a feeling there's going to be a lot of development in this space in the next year or two.
ty bro!
I think you are assuming that I am missing the point. I was laughing at how correct the statement above was. Nice job looking like a moron. Nothing was missed by me.
&gt; Nice job looking like a moron. I don't think that's the case, but you certainly made yourself look like a douchebag!
Why do this when you can write everything in Visual Basic? ^^/s 
Seems like a bad clone of https://plot.ly/python/
That honestly sounds like a design issue to me, at least for most cases. 
I don't think you'll find a boilerplate solution; the best way to solve this will depend on the specific circumstances. Without any further information I'd vote for your option 1: the object/namespace that gets passed to all functions. This is known as a class in python. 
/r/learnpython
Ahh, I see now. You're right that `union` doesn't make a whole lot of sense as a valid import. I'm still learning towards something in his environment being borked. 
As easy as a `from mocket.plugins.httpretty import HTTPretty, httprettified`.
Pelican is awesome! I've been using it daily for over 6 years (to generate [fullstackpython.com](https://www.fullstackpython.com/) and [the Full Stack Python blog](https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog.html)) and highly recommend it for creating a blog static site. At the very least it should be on your short list of static site generators to try out.
Good point. 
My first truly-useful Python program was a netmiko script I wrote to pull down the IP address of the configured Netflow collector IP from a router so I could access the right collector to view data. Automating the more tedious parts of my job has motivated me to learn more.
Pelican is great, been running on kinds of websites on that little guy - from blogs to data listings etc. 
&gt;I'm not sure how to programatically turn those phrases into the function. I don't want to have to store 1 to 1 readings. I'm not looking for anyone to program me any examples or anything. I'm more or less just looking for a flow of logic to explain how this is done. A classic approach would be to categorise the words and use those to determine the context of the sentence. For example, "Are" is a question word, you can pick apart nouns/verbs etc. and you can remove stop words to leave only "useful" words. Then use these to make a guess at the meaning of sentence. So for example if it was a system set up per room you can have a list of words containing words such as "basement", "loft", "living room", "master bedroom" which, when found in the inputted speech, can be used to determine the where in checkLights(where). You would just layer it up from there. If "Are" (a question) exists in a sentence with "basement", you can checkLights(basement) and return whether they are on/off. The other words in the input (the, lights, on) don't add anything to the query and aren't important to parse. The key here would be getting as much info as possible from as few words, you aren't building something that truly understands English 
A Google search led me here and I've to say that's a great example! Thanks!
I would love to do work with tensorflow; if only I could get it to install properly. 
Since others have mentioned some good existing options, I'll add that writing one of these yourself is a really good exercise especially for someone new to Python. I wrote my own using [mako](http://www.makotemplates.org/) and [PyYAML](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml).
python is kinda poor in this area. If you know nodejs, there are a good number of feature complete modules that you could use to do this. Do a quick google search and you'll find quite a few. I'm a big fan of this one https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdf-fill-form
I downloaded Jupiter for a recent assignment. 
Thank you for the feedback. I like best the idea of finding a good book and then supplementing it with tutorials via YouTube and other sites. -Ven
You might find www.pythonsandladders.com useful. Tons of exercises.
Look into loops. while (count &lt; 5): # get random number count += 1
https://github.com/wuub/SublimeREPL
If you want a list of 5 random numbers, you can write: from random import randint numbers = [randint(0,100) for i in range(5)]
Essentially what I want it to do is have it display Set 1: and generate 5 random numbers , then have it display the words Set 2: and have it generate 5 random numbers and so on. 
I exported the spreadsheet as can and used that to make an xml that I could import into Adobe premiere. I just used the .format() on an xml template for the in/out time and contents of each subtitle based on the csv file.
You just want a function that prints out 5 random numbers between 0 and 100? You can write this: def five_randoms(): from random import randint return [randint(0,100) for i in range(5)] Then use it like this: print(five_randoms())
I've gotten it to print out 5 random numbers now I need it say another statement and display another set of 5 numbers and I need to do that x amount of times I ask it to do that
You can `print(five_randoms())` as many time as you want. If you want to do it 40 times you could use a loop like this: for i in range(40): print(five_randoms())
What is your concrete scenario? What are these functions doing and what is the data?
Bravo 
Could always try programming puzzle games. [Untrusted](https://alexnisnevich.github.io/untrusted/) is pretty much the ur-example, and there's also [INJECTION](schilcote.itch.io/injection) which is a Python-based imitator (which I made, incidentally.) People cite Zach Barth\Zachtronics' games, but honestly I think they're way more puzzle than programming...
This sub is NOT a homework service! 
1: /r/learnpython 2: we will not do your homework for you.
I dont want you to do my homework i need help on the code i have the part where it prints the ticks and the tocks but i do not know how to make it repeat the amount of times the disks are chosen 
There is no way for us to know that unless you post your code. This is still the wrong sub.
Using this answer, and incorporating what you mentioned earlier, try this: for i in range(1, 41): print("Set {0}: {1}".format(str(i), ", ".join(map(str, five_randoms()))))
As a moderator over there yes indeed. Python is a popular language in responses. 
&gt; function like SoundEx very cool!
Add tests! Especially if this is meant to be a teaching tool. Tests will allow newbies to make sure their code is working as intended instead of just assuming they got it right.
StreamListener is used to house methods to process incoming tweets (on_data etc); it does not contribute to the rate limit in any way. The filter method of the Stream class is what will end up connecting you to the Twitter endpoint (Stream.filter -&gt; Stream._start -&gt; Stream._run). Each connection counts as 1 request. You will be rate limited if you reconnect too often in too short of a time period. Tweepy has a backoff strategy implemented (in Stream._run) to prevent this from happening.
Thanks so much for this. It's a great way to refresh my rusty skills. Thank you for taking the time.
The blend of theory and practical is just right, tastes good in your hands and head.
You mean *index* with booleans. And it's a terrible idea from a readability point of view. 
Glad you found it helpful!
Yes, (will edit), and... Yes, but can be useful.
It's a double edged sword :/ I wrote a ton of Python mixed with Ansible roles to automate a ton of stuff in my job. I'm probably productive from about 9AM-Noon..then sit doing nothing most of the day :(
I wrote a long blog post on using fuzzy matching and the strengths and weaknesses of the different techniques. https://findwatt.com/blog/confused-people-dont-buy-how-fuzzy-matching-helps You can skip the intro explaining why fuzzy matching is important. To summarize, you need a phonetic type algorithm that can create a hash between remotely similar names, and use that to break them down into clusters to analyze more closely using damerau-levenshtein and n-gram/jaccard. For a list of that scale, you might consider using multiple levels of abstraction (maybe first do phonetic, then do ngram-jaccard, then do levenshtein on the ones that pass through those). To make things more complex, for names you also have to deal with name synonyms (Mike == Michael, Dave == David, etc). For names, I don't think numbers are important to deal with at the phonetic level. For some unicode characters, you can clean them back to standard ascii. I have no idea what to suggest on pictographic type characters.
I will be focusing on these specific libraries, probably in this order: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, SciKit-Learn, Matplotlib.
Thanks for sharing this, it was interesting to read. Also may be somewhat relevant to a project I'm working on with computational image processing. Our results are similar to yours where smaller datasets are better done on a CPU.
&gt; Yes, but can be useful. In what way? 
I've said it before - I think the sub should just block medium.com. There may be some occasional useful posts there but most of the links are just spam bullshit for courses.
Ha, that was probably me!
Are you Bob???
Beau, right there in the username, but just remember bob probably didn't like it either. I'm in the gov and our tool sets are limited by IT, it's rough. Vba and such are good for building things for the lay person, roll out an Excel macro and your 65 yr old boss can utilize it, python is great when only you have to run things. End user tends to dictate the platform

That's a terrible idea from a readability point of view. Readable is better than short.
In small doses: `print (['off', 'on'][flag])` is tolerable. Personally I would use `print('yes' if flag else 'no')` but I'm fine with either.
On Windows, you generally want to check if the library is available here[here](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) first, before compiling it yourself.
virustotal gave me a 22/65 for v1.0.3 and 12/64 for the 1.0.54 (windows versions)
I don't see SDL on there. What is the process for installing libraries not on the site you linked?
It actually supports other kinds of data as well, just not as nicely. :) I went ahead and rewrote the code examples using it a couple of days ago. It's quite nice so far! Thanks for the recommendation.
I like to use projecteuler.net. It’s kinda heavy on math, but you can flex your research and math skills in addition to practicing more advanced language features (sometimes)
Will this release includes django-channels?
Great to hear! Do you have links to examples of other kinds of data?
I've been enjoying the Algorithms section on HackerRank lately. 
You can use itemA if x else item B which is much cleaner.
still worse than print("on" if flag else "off")
Core is working on it, for coroutines and generators at least: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0550/
If I understand this correctly, the message was sent as the APP instead of our username, right ?
The data package is up [here](https://quiltdata.com/package/ResidentMario/geoplot_data). Their README, which is nice and simple, states that other forms of data are supported, but don't get the same fancy feature surface that frames get, just a basic packaging and archiving. The biggest qualm I have is with their retrieval API, which gives a *pandas DataFrame* if you ask for frame data, and a *filesystem path* to your data if you ask for non-frame data. I imagine they wrote the first part first, then the second part later, and as a result couldn't get a unified API. So it looks like this for frame and non-frame data respectively: ` from quilt.data.ResidentMario import geoplot_data ` ` frame = geoplot_data.frame_data() # df ` ` nonframe = gpd.read_file(geoplot_data.nonframe_data()) # ~df `

Hi! I'm, uh, kinda desperate for work. I come from a poor family and they've run out of money to put me through college, and since I was just going there for a rubber stamp anyway I figure I can get away with just going straight on to work. I've been working with Python for around eight years or so; don't even remember when I started learning to program. I've successfully delivered products to people a couple of times and I'm pretty comfortable with whatever technology you want me to use. I *generally* prefer doing native application\backend stuff, and most of my experience is in tools, glue-code, and scripting. I'll do whatever you need me to do though, I'm happy as long as I can code. :P Here's my GitLab: https://gitlab.com/toastengineer Here's the most polished project I have going at the moment, although, uh, maybe don't look at the code for it *first*, I wrote most of it in three days for a game jam: http://schilcote.itch.io/injection I'm based in the U.S. and would *prefer* not to emigrate but I'd consider it. I have absolutely no attachments, I could get on a plane to wherever tomorrow morning. Feel free to PM or E-Mail me with questions, my E-Mail address is just my username at gmail.com.
no, django-channels is separate project. see https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2016/sep/09/channels-adopted-official-django-project/
Wow thanks that's exactly my problem! I know the basics but it's so hard to move on any further and actually gain any proficiency. 
There are much better places to learn Python, CodeAcademy is fine for supplemental practise. I suggest picking a more comprehensive approach like the official tutorial, Byte of Python, or the Coders Apprentice 
nice :) for me https://www.codewars.com/ helped in lot (even the initial two questions to get in were nice) - especially seeing smart solutions and discussions after solving a kata.. I made a [list](https://github.com/learnbyexample/scripting_course/blob/master/Python_curated_resources.md#code-practice) - there are some that use gamification.. and then [creating my own bunch of exercises](https://github.com/learnbyexample/Python_Basics/blob/master/Exercises.md) (with tests and solutions added) was a good experience as well

How about using a dictionary instead? myDict = { False: 'foo', True: 'bar', } print(myDict[False])
Drawing like that on modern PC hardware, especially with python, would be terribly slow. That said, with a little boilerplate to open a window and allocate/lock the buffer for drawing, it's very easy to do with pygame or allegro. 
In other words, python's ternary operator which is actually made for this situation. &gt;There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
See below for the ternary operator which is how to do this.

I `useradd` for every app I run under supervisord.
Just open the command line window and enter `py -3.6 -m pip install pygame` to install pygame. It still relies on the outdated SDL 1.2 version and is not very fast. If you want to use SDL 2 you can check out [PySDL2](https://pysdl2.readthedocs.io/en/rel_0_9_6/), but the learning resources are rather scarce. You could also check out Cocos-2d or pyglet (Cocos uses pyglet under the hood). In the near future (maybe some months?) you'll also be able to use Python as a scripting language in the excellent [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/). Also, questions should be posted in /r/learnpython or /r/pygame.
Lookup selenium and chromedriver 
Put the import on line 1 of your main script. Don't make pyInstaller do the trace. It can get it wrong.
np.argsort()
Questions go to /r/learnpython, not here. And format your code properly. `str.join()` expects an iterable of strings. You're passing a list that contains a dict. You can't use that with `str.join()`. I don't know what you're actually trying to accomplish here, so I can't suggest what you need to change. 
&gt; Every system so far is based on wrappers around virtualenv which makes the architecture of the package managers very different from what we use in ours. No, none of them are. Pip is entirely independent of virtualenv. Conda does not use virtualenv at all. Have you read https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0405/, specifically how the prefix and site-packages are computed?
Based on their install docs here[here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation), they already provide pre-compiled binaries for both 32-bit &amp; 64-bit Windows. You should be able to use that already with Pygame.
maybe not "scanner.q", maybe self.q?
Thank you for pointing that out. I suppose I should delve into conda code. But we'd already decided wrap `pip` according to a recommendation from #pypa on freenode.
I use DEAP with neural networks and since then didn't have to bother using anything else. It's production ready and it always amazes management. I recommend that, a whole lot of research went into making that framework. In the end you can program your own methods for doing that, it's not complicated. Where it shines is when you want to have a more advanced grid search but also for models that are deployed in changing environments (iot etc..) Let me know if you have questions i'm knees deep in the topic.

Leg extensions.
first off, this isn't the right place to ask this kind of question, you'd be better served by /r/learnpython or StackOverflow now, onto the question a correct way to filter `timeline` for tweets that contain `#NMD` would be: ``` timeline = api.user_timeline(...) for tweet in timeline: if '#nmd' in tweet.text.lower(): api.update_status("Testing", tweet.id) ``` now, twitter's advanced search can do that for you, and [a twitter search for `from:adidasoriginals #nmd`](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Aadidasoriginals%20%23nmd) will give you just those tweets you want: ``` tweets = api.search(q = "from:adidasoriginals #nmd") for tweet in tweets: api.update_status("Testing", tweet.id) ``` 
I'm having a hard time understanding what you're asking, but I think you want something like this: &gt;&gt;&gt; for (row, letter), (col, number) in itertools.product(enumerate('abc'), enumerate((1, 2, 3))): ... print(f'[{row}, {col}] = {letter}{number}') ... [0, 0] = a1 [0, 1] = a2 [0, 2] = a3 [1, 0] = b1 [1, 1] = b2 [1, 2] = b3 [2, 0] = c1 [2, 1] = c2 [2, 2] = c3 That is, the tuples returned by `enumerate()` can be used as the inputs to `itertools.product()`, you just need to unpack them. 
&gt; this property outweighs their [initially large time discrepancy](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46584544) Not totally on topic, but isn't part of this discrepancy just because the two functions as written are not functionally equivalent? It seems a little disingenuous to compare them directly. from itertools import product def nested_for(first_iter, second_iter): result = [] for i in first_iter: for j in second_iter: result.append((i, j)) return result def using_product(first_iter, second_iter): result = [] for i, j in product(first_iter, second_iter): result.append((i, j)) return result a, b = [1,2,3], 'abc' print(nested_for(iter(a), iter(b))) print(using_product(iter(a), iter(b))) 
&gt; assuming a and b are the lists we want to iterate over You have a difference because your **a** and **b** are not lists but iterators. 
I think the same. I'll add tests soon :)
Yeah I was talking about the linked SO post, there doesn't seem to be anything there about they needing to be lists, or any other form of non-consumable iterable.
Why do you even need these local variables? Also, `jsonify` seems like a Flask function and I think it will be better to stick to bundled `json` module.
I'm not an expert on these kind of interview questions, but I think the problem is too general to make specific technology recommendations (like hadoop). They didnt give you any details that would suggest any specific piece of technology would solve their issues. I think they're looking for a more general, business-minded answer. You need to put on your salesman hat. You are trying to sell a consulting services to a business; techology/data just happens to be the domain. Can you make a business case for the bank to invest in data consulting? Make that case first. 
Talk about how a robust data infrastructure would help fep5orting, provide real-time feedback to inform business decisions, and if designed well, could be scaled to grow/adapt with the organization. Show how it would pay them dividends in the long run.
I think pioneering the 3-hour work day is a virtuous activity in itself.
product is an iterator, iterators cannot have indices. If you have iterator with indices then most likely it stores the list inside. So then what is the gain from that? You don't save any memory but create one more level of abstraction.
&gt;Why do you even need these local variables? I like to use them if I'm building schemas, it's just a personal preference. &gt;Also, jsonify seems like a Flask function Been knee deep in flask.
I'm glad you like it. I created these out of some of my answers at Stack Overflow :)
I'm glad you like it :)
You're welcome.
That is exactly what I needed. Thanks a lot. The returned tuples messed with me.
import re
Seeing this on mobile but based on how you pasted the string, could you not just split on new lines and then on the semicolon? Something like: lines = yourString.split('\n') # or \r\n? fields = map(lambda x: x.split(':')) That should leave you a list of tuples where first is the key and second is the value. I think you can feed that right to dict() to make the dictionary and then to json.load (using built in json lib). Probably need to strip whitespace and colons from the values with another map/lambda but I think that would get you started
Well this is my approach also. However, when are you sure that you actually know Python? I mean I am full time using Python to solve and create, however I also find my self looking and searching for tutorials, because I feel the need to learn. Or to phrase it properly, I feel like I don't know much. Maybe it's my imposter syndrome talking, but that's how I feel.
If you like puzzles I highly recommend http://www.pythonchallenge.com/
Thanks. I'll dive into it.

This way of learning is great for beginners. You'll be forced to learn exactly as much as you need to solve a problem. However, how do you know you solved it in the best way? My recommendation is to pick up the book _Fluent Python_. You don't need to read it front to back but, whenever you get a chance, just pick a chapter or section that you don't know about and read it. This will help you move from a beginner level to an intermediate level pretty quickly.

systems engineer... life gets easier when your automate everything....and I mean everything. 
Yeah, that's right.
thanks. I'm starting to get some ideas of how to work through this. lol they still need some fine tuning, but this does help give me a bit of direction.
That book has been on my list for quite some time now. I guess casual reading is better than no reading at all. One chapter every few days should be a great skill booster. Thanks for the tip. Cheers
Absolutely, that's what I have been doing. It's also a great reference book. You will learn a lot by just digging in and solving problems with Python but this book is an excellent supplement.
Sweet!!!!! Love this!
This looks great! Here is the link that Gryd included in their blogpost as an example of a published Jupyter Notebook - https://beta.gryd.us/notebook/published/5sNPGxBZUfxTGMykY54HRm/Getting%20Started.ipynb
Thanks. I'll check it out today.
Great stuff man. You have inspired me to expand my knowledge of Python. I mean, working on projects provides depth, but books provide the desirable width, in order to take on projects that you have never touched before. Python ftw!
I was once given code that did this. It was a nightmare. It may have seemed obvious to the one writing it when he wrote it, but after the code had evolved the parts of this operation had gotten separated from each other by dozens of lines so it wasn't at all clear what was going on. The first thing I did was go through and turn all of these into ternary operations.
Exactly! I have an open source Python package that I have published. Originally, when I wrote the package, I was using decorators but I wasn't aware of callable objects. After learning about callable objects from the book, I refactored my decorator function into a callable object and then used that callable object as a decorator. The resulting API was a little bit neater and easier to test.
I am one of the founders of Gryd. Happy to answer any questions you all might have...
Thanks. I'll check it out.
Awesome stuff. Shoot me a link of the package and I will give it a star.

The pseudocode of this is: 1. Separate out the Information line 2. Split your information into key, value pairs 3. Pack that information into a JSON The complicating factor is the CAMERA NAME(NUM) value, so rather than use some complex regex, we can just treat that as a single key and split it later. emailtext = """Network Video Recorder: Motion Detected On Channel D4 This is an automatically generated e-mail from your NVR. EVENT TYPE: Motion Detected EVENT TIME: 2017-10-17,21:47:52 NVR NAME: Network Video Recorder NVR S/N: redacted CAMERA NAME(NUM): Path(D4)""" #Separate out the Information line emailtext = emailtext.split("\n")[-1:][0] #Find key indicies key_indicies = [emailtext.find(key) for key in ['EVENT TYPE','EVENT TIME','NVR NAME','NVR S/N','CAMERA NAME(NUM)']] JSON = {} #This line does all the heavy lifting, looking at a subsection between key indicies and splitting that subsection by the ':' delimiter. for key, value in [keyvaluepair.strip().split(':',1) for keyvaluepair in [emailtext[i:j] for i,j in zip(key_indicies, key_indicies[1:]+[None])]]: #The 'CAMERA NAME(NUM)' entry has some special handling to split path and num if key == 'CAMERA NAME(NUM)': JSON['CAMERA NAME'] = value.split('(')[0] JSON['NUM'] = value.split('(')[1][:-1] else: JSON[key] = value print(JSON) Let me know if you have any questions!
I write code on a daily basis but as a researcher or a scientist, not as a developer. Over the last few years, I have found great value in using Jupyter as a tool to process and visualize data but I have also had to spend a *lot* of time getting Jupyter correctly setup so that I am able to access it remotely and securely. I believe that one of the best things about Jupyter is that it is browser based and, to me, browser based &gt;&gt; remotely accessible &gt;&gt; cloud based. I spoke to some of my colleagues and found that the setup (and sometimes package management) involved with Jupyter was a pain point for them too. Hence, Gryd.

Out of curiosity, what was the impetus to write this?
This problem seems pretty fundamental to me... have to localise information / make the flow of information explicit / make it easy to do things. I guess language features can make bits easier. 
Teaching computers how to look at photographs and determine how "creepy" they look. "Subjective ML" at its finest.
A lot of people don't understand that a micro-service should be modeled after the business logic, not resources. This tutorial doesn't differ.
Not Python-related. I spent the weekend working on an iOS app (using Swift) to pull data from Fitbit and push it to Apple Health. For reasons unknown, Fitbit refuses to add this functionality into their own app. Intraday (down to 1 second granularity) heart rate data is only available for “personal” apps, so existing third-party apps cannot retrieve this data. 
You should really apply for a mid-managerial position in an enterprise software corporation. I see a bright future for you in that role.
Awesome. There's a /r/learnpython subreddit where you can learn python so you can write code that does exactly this! 
Okay, thanks!
I agree, I want to mutter a little about what this means. I would note that deciding where information goes, how it moves around, and what gets hidden is a *fundamental and non-soluble part of computer programming*, at least in my opinion. So saying a design issue doesn't necessarily mean in my opinion that something is particularly wrong, just this sort of thing is par for the course of certain types of programs above a certain size. In my head I kind of think of modules / classes / whatever as similar to organs in living creatures to convince myself that these concepts are kind of fundamental. Sorry... that sounds a bit didactic, I'm mostly talking to myself here. Methods on objects (and partially applied functions) allow a way of packaging information up so you don't repeatedly have to refer to it, while hiding the information from intermediaries (or at least limiting how they can interact with data to method calls). In this case it looks like perhaps `z` should me a method on something that keeps the information. I'm going to mention "dependency injection frameworks" (e.g. pinject) as a way of automating some of the processes of "spreading information around". But note that people will curse you for using them.

Do you have any good resources on micro-services and business logic?
I recommend the Python Documentation tutorial if you have any previous programming experience. If not then Automate the boring stuff is a great way to learn basic software design. Then after that move onto the py documentation. From there it really depends on what you want. Data processing, games, networking, web development etc. Pick one and just make projects, read other individuals' code etc. But throughout your journey I recommend learning more software design principles. Algorithms, OOP, MVC, etc. and MIT OCW is a great way to learn all of this stuff as their catalogue is large and extensive.
Wow, this project are in github?
This is a good point. I have recently been going back and doing online courses because many of the concepts I learned were as a result of necessity, so best practices sort of went out the window. So I do spend a decent amount of time unlearning bad habits. I do feel like I do actually know Python, though maybe with less rigor than someone who is classically trained.
You put the path in the pathex variable in the Analysis step in the SPEC file.
pytest is a pretty defacto standard. I'm not sure what you'd get more from a spec style framework to the pytest one. Your example could be pretty simply. def test_foo(): assert foo(x) == 5 There's very little boilerplate, and it seems just as clear? Can you say what you're missing (sorry I haven't really used spec outside of very brief interactions of copy/paste when adding functionality). 
you can either use the datetime or time modules or use something like cron.

If it's only gonna run once, use at. 
The command "at" would be used too? 
Another approach: you can parse the DSL into a python AST and execute it in the python VM. Example: http://greentreesnakes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tofrom.html

Others have mentioned DEAP, so I’ll also mention PyGMO, which is made by the European Space Agency. I found DEAP and PyGMO while I was looking for genetic algorithms, and didn’t even try PyGMO because there’s not a package installable via pip, although it does seem to have lots of documentation.

It looks like you cut that function out of a class. You can't just cut out a function and expect it the work. The "self" that it's referring to is the class instance that's missing.

There's a lot of approaches. I remember I had an approach of non-turing complete DSL for spam scanning which did enough work using simple yaml like structure.

Thanks. I was in doubts from what to start, but chose this option because it seemed to be a good balance between classic calendar and hex one.
Yes, they have. But it the worse API I just saw. Is not complete too. You only have access a few infos. You can look at: [MAL API](https://myanimelist.net/modules.php?go=api)
yes, as i explained, i wanted to find a balance between classic calendar and hex one.
I'm not okay with it. I don't like that aspect of npm. Also is this really a "package manager"? I wouldn't say so--that implies a much broader scope. In fairness I'm not sure what *to* call this. An environment manager?

You can't install a python2 package on python3. python3 is simply not compatible with python2 code. Pythone provides a [`2to3`](https://docs.python.org/3.1/library/2to3.html) program that attempts to convert python2 code into python3 code, but it's kinda hit-and-miss. Your best option is to use the proper version. IOW find a python3 module or use python2. --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython.

No, you cannot "solve this problem". You simply cannot run python2 code in python3. You also cannot run C++ or javascript or grandma's cookie recipe in python3 either. You have to convert the python2 code to python3 code. As I said, python provides a tool to help with that. 
It converts just about any type to a string and back. This is useful for e.g. saving to/loading from a file or sending stuff across the internet.

I dislike all DSLs. Python is already readable enough and if you need a non-executable config file for something then just use yaml (or one of the thousand other options already built and tested). I've been scarred by many 1 off company specific DSLs. The cost way outpaces the gain in the long run. This is directed less at the OP and more at the community

It would be called a package manager becuase "it manages packages". It's not creating an environment in any sense at all. You can install local and global packages. Seems to me you're trying to find reasons and failing. Saying you don't like something doesn't make it valid.

1. No. The most recent version of Python 3 is installed as well as the most recent version of Python 2 (because some old packages still depend on it). 2. Yes, system-wide. 3. Depends. If I need libs for projects I am working on they all go into a project-specific virtualenv. Otherwise I just install them through the system's package manager. 4. no

There's one crucial point you're missing: python is a core component of most Linux desktop environments. As such, it *must* be installed system-wide, and a lot of components depend on the versions (2.x &amp; 3.x) provided by the distro to be installed via the package manager.
Imo the best way to learn is to pick a small project and do it (the language itself is remarkably easy). Since your want to get into freelance why don't you go log into some freelance sites like upwork and look at some of the jobs posted and think about how you could do those. Maybe take a simple one and skin it down into something bitesized and make a project out of it. You won't make money for a long time obviously so don't get over your head

Late to the party but I'll chime in, I did quite a lot of R (in academia) before switching to python. If you start from scratch, my advice is to go full python. It's a general purpose langage which will help you make anything you can think of, including stats and graphs. A few years ago R advantages were mostly statistics and graphics (ggplot2 graph package), but now the gap is smaller in these domains as python also has great graphics (including ggplot2 which is NEAT), and numpy/pandas are pretty nice. It is also obviously more powerful and has a better syntax. R syntax is weird and quite different from most langages, so python will be better if at some point you want to learn another langage. The only thing which could favor you go for R is 1) lots and lots of specific stats and 2) working with a team which uses mostly R. If you do so, be sure to work with Rstudio it's a great IDE for R helps a lot.
If you are a Java or C (C++ C#) programmer and are used to build large applications which require lots of computing power, you will find it slow and suboptimal. But for quick prototyping this langage is awesome. In 1 hour you can code anything. It's the best "glue" langage IMO, just download a bunch of libraries and link them together in a few lines of codes (very short syntax). If the project gets bigger and / or performance is an issue, you translate it in Java or whatever.
You could certainly have the script handle it's own scheduling, but it adds the extra layer of having to keep that script alive (execute on boot / daemon / service), far simpler to just use the native OS scheduler - either CRON or Task Scheduler (Windows). This way you just set your script to do something when executed and have the OS scheduler handle the scheduling issues (e.g. what to do when missed, how often, etc.). 
Hello Poogles :-) Specs allow easier documentation, and fine nesting into states. For example - I can do the following: describe User context 'When authorized' it 'can log into the system' # Test end it 'can view the user panel' # Test end end context 'When no authorized' it 'can't log into the system' # Test end end end The object in test here is `User`, and it has two states - authorized and not authorized. Each state got his own tests in it, and in the future I can easily add more state or perhaps more tests under specific state. This of-course is still possible by separated the two states into lets say different test suites - but the above feels (at least for someone with RSpec background) more easier to understand and read. Not to mention - the easy string format `It can do something that I want it to do` it easier to read and document if you compare it to `def can_do_something_that_i_want_it_to_do():`. I agree both run tests at the end, but spec frameworks act more then just tests, they act as documentation for the next programmer who modify the code, and are easier to get a 'top down view' for TDD compared to just methods that are not in specific order :) Thanks!
Well, it's that or die. Django 2.0, out around December, doesn't support Python 2 at all.
You can use django or if you know R you can use Shiny
This looks really neat. I'm gonna have to give it a go. I'm still really new to programming, but I can whack out some basic scripts. Might be fun to see if I can get around the puzzles.
Agreed. For the very basics OP could try the SoloLearn app (free on Android/iOS). It'll give a general understanding of the language. Helps set the foundation.
I mainly use R so I definitely thought of Shiny, though I only did the Coursera course with the basics. I know how to do row selection with filtering though I'm unaware of allowing user input while keeping the data and moving on to the following rows. Also, when deploying a shiny app online, do the shiny files already include the CSV from my desktop or do I need to make it available to the app (i.e. onlines). I ask this since I used R's mtcars for the Coursera course.
Agreed about "Automate the Boring Stuff" mentioned above. For the very basics you could try the SoloLearn app (free on Android/iOS). It'll give a general understanding of the language. Helps set the foundation. Can complete the course in a few hours. After that, you'll want to start finding projects to do. Think of stuff you could automate and do it in Python, work through the issues. As you get better / more comfortable, your projects will grow in scope. Doing tutorials is good, but doing your own project is way better as you have to think your way through the design. 
That's a key, don't let the company know you're automating it. Gives them an excuse to cut your hours or get rid of you entirely. You're essentially programming yourself out of a job.
Whatever I can! My last project was automating the creation of jersey files (these hockey jerseys are printed to fabric and sewn up). The normal scenario was manually creating a set of jersey files (different sizes, different files for chest, back, Larm, Rarm) for each player and design. It took awhile, even with a sophisticated Photoshop data variable setup. Now, I just save the design file templates and a script loads a CSV w/player name, #, size, design style, font, and some other settings. Outputs the files for the manufacturer. I usually just send the CSV to the client to fill in.
Yes. That what I meant with "You only have access a few infos". :/

If it is outside of your area of expertise, why have you seemingly decided to use Dash?
The only needed switch is regulated with the executable name, for example in Ubuntu those are python and python3, representing two major Python versions. You could also have other versions installed system wide, for example python3.6 in Ubuntu 16.04 (python3 from official repository is Python 3.5.2). You may install Python packages through official OS repositories (apt-get in Ubuntu; names often start with `python-`) or through pip. After you installed python-pip or/and python3-pip invoke them with `pip`, respectively `pip3`. You are installing packages either for that user or system wide. That's about Python in your OS. In development you pick a python version from OS (2 or 3) together with respective pip and use it to install your virtual environment for particular project. Use virtualenv, virtualenvwrapper, pipenv, ... or whatever tool you want.
Thank you
It would depend on how you build the shiny app. Some contain the csv already others have a function to read the csv file. 
This is why you should use safe_load(), not load()
Great work, they look really nice and it's a really cool idea. Thanks for sharing!
This helps a lot thanks! I am an IT generalist with the goal of learning programming. The first part of that is to learn the basics. -Ven
I started using Dash these 2 weeks, and I feel it is easy to learn and use. It requires some knowledge of react programming, which I have no knowledge before, but didn't feel hard to understand the basic concept. I would say, if possible, hire someone who has experience developing react webpage before. But even one don't have this kind of knowledge, it should not be difficult to understand Dash. 
Because it looks like the end product I need for clients, done in a pretty, yet simple enough way.
Thank you.

My gut reaction is that Python isn't natively very useful in creating interfaces and an SSIS package could help you in dealing with data, however I use Python with SQL all the time so I'll bite. The Python module that you want is pypyodbc, and its documentation should be enough to get you off the ground. In the long run, I'm not sure how your interface should be written (I'm a CLI guy myself) but Python can be great as a back end (giggity).
Feel free to PM me with questions.
If you run Windows, use Windows Task Scheduler. Native to all recent Windows versions... You have your job's task "run a program" pointing to the Python executable and enter the script name as an argument.
Awesome thank you! I will do that!
I thought newer Pythons were going to start throwing errors on invalid escapes in string literals, i.e. `'C:\Documents'` (yes, I know you can use forward slashes for paths, but students used to Windows may take a while) which is silently turned into `'C:\\Documents'`. The notes just say stuff about `re.sub` refusing borked escapes.
That's pretty harsh, isn't it? HTML, SQL, and regular expressions are all DSLs...
For user local versions, virtualenv controls both python version and packages. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45293436/how-to-specify-python-version-used-to-create-virtual-environment You just have to specify the path to the python executable. It doesn't have to be installed.
How about SQLAchemy? Is it a great choice?
I think it's pretty different. It's a little murky but I'd say that the ones your listed are all well established enough to be fine. For example if you were running a business would you let your devs write an app you needed in some brand new language that had about ten users and no traction? Definitely not, but that's basically what happens when a person makes their own DSL only instead of ten users it has one

Ah, I think I understand now — it seems virtualenv is more like Ruby's Bundler, in that it: 1. is project-specific, 2. manages dependencies, and 3. is a library of the target language itself. In that sense, pyenv looks more like a direct analog to rvm/rbenv/chruby. The fact that virtualenv can also manage the current python version is still curious to me, though.
Okay, that's interesting. So does that mean that for virtualenv to work, it needs to be installed system-wide alongside a system-wide python, while its job is to place a separate, user-local python executable on the `$PATH`? Does that mean that when virtualenv runs, it's always running off of the system-wide python? How does it ensure that when it's placed another python on the `$PATH`?
u ok
Isn't this the Python subreddit? I think you meant Dec 25 `is` Oct 31. 
Those are false positives - I got them too (Avast). If in doubt, exe can be built from source (using pyinstaller).
You need to run the virtualenv executable. Actually installing it is the easiest way to do so. `source env/bin/activate` just runs a bash script that changes your path. Virtualenv executable only creates that script and creates the necessary paths, essentially. It probably does that with python code run by whatever version of python is your path when you run it. That has no effect on what version of python gets put into the env.
how difficult would it be to implement a plug-in system like qBitTorrent’s search tab? I believe it’s based on Python as one has to install it to have access to the feature. if torrench could load the search plug-ins that are already available for qBT - and there are lots! -, and you shipped torrench with no plugins at all you’d be doing two good things at once: 1) you’d be covering your back. the user chooses the plugins. therefore it’s their sole responsibility (pretty much what Kodi does) what they download and where from. 2) you’d be giving the user the chance to choose their sources. i really like your idea, but I think that distributing the software with the ability to scan sites such as kat and tpb out of the box you’re taking a massive, unnecessary risk. implement a plugin system and dump the burden on the user.

Jam-py perhaps.
This is really cool! Would love to contribute. Any particular area where I can help?
What? Why is 257 not 256 + 1 in python? 
What do you mean that 'virtualenv can also manage the current python version'? Activating virtualenv just sets system paths so you're using python from created virtualenv version. The `-p` option for virtualenv is used just for point which system python version (if you have more than one in system) use to create target virtualenv.
Never used any of these, but here you go: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/3cstcq/cython_numba_pypy_latest_comparison_2015/

Well, if that language is a means to get client vendor-lockedin, I'd say stay out of the game if you dont like it, Morty. On a serious note, I completely agree: Py already has libs and frameworks that abstract thing so much theres no space left for DSL anyway - and thats the way to go.
Works! I'll PM you.
Thanks for the reply. I want to ask somethings... Sorry for the newbie questions, I am working on this to learn Python. Modules are loaded only once in the memory, i.e., when imported on other modules we will be importing the same reference in the memory? How will it behave against the GC? My cache will be cleaned or does it remain static?
My understanding is that virtualenv can change which version of python is in your `$PATH`, not only for system pythons but user-local pythons as well (per [the link shared by /u/elbiot below](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45293556/4865822)). I'm saying it's strange that virtualenv itself depends on python to run, but in the process of doing its job, may change which version of python it's running against. (That is, unless virtualenv ensures that it always runs against the same system version of python.)
I decided to go with Pelican. Thanks!

Yea I guess but I just want a simple interface that I can use kinda likens command line for one off addresses.
I am a little curious. the other day i saw a awesome video about machine learning and now I am hooked on it and want to learn about it myself. At the moment I have no experience in python this far, but I wanted to learn it nevertheless for a long time. What came to my mind was: Why is python used for machine learning? Why not a more performant language like C or even Java (Python should be slower because it is interpreted and Java is at least compiled to bytecode). Also I am very excited for GO and was curious if there are any machine learning libraries for it. Maybe someone can shef a little light onto a newbe :) Kind regards
[Obligatory StackExchange topic link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/306313/is-operator-behaves-unexpectedly-with-integers).
Well, I'll give you the simplest reason why not a more performant language (C++ or Java which you pointed out). If I'm a scientist, a researcher, I wouldn't really want to learn C++ or Java, because I have to dedicate a lot of time doing that. I want to express my ideas fast and continue with my research. I don't want to deal with pointers and micro optimizations, VM's and makefiles. That's one of the things that's really appealing in Python.
Nice format, good idea. Also, throw something harder at us! :-)
I still have your whole set of cards as my background. This is really cool. 
thank you for your answer. i wondered if the performance point would weigh a lot more when the learning process takes a longer time frame over weeks or even months (scientific stuff an what not)
Yeah. You could use Kubernetes or Swarm on Digital Ocean.
What would be the best option for this scenario (small csv in my personal computer only)? How could I integrate the csv directly?
[dnslib.intercept](https://bitbucket.org/paulc/dnslib/src/d2c17b8b154de94deabd981dda84f65c1e084565/dnslib/intercept.py?at=default&amp;fileviewer=file-view-default) looks promising.
I believe you do have to install Python on every computer, the install is only 32mb but there are alternatives. You can run python on sites like repl.it and trinket.io, but those online interpreters can't access your local files. 
You can use Py2exe to bundle the interpreter and your code as a Windows executable: http://www.py2exe.org/index.cgi/Tutorial
If you're looking to match names in a fuzzy way then you probably want something like [Metaphone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphone), a more modern [Soundex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex). [This Python module](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Metaphone/0.6) implements Metaphone 
&gt; I dislike all DSLs. So maybe not all... Also, what is YAML then? ;)
Django + bokeh would be the perfect combination for this sort of task. 
Thanks for your reply! That was what I was afraid of.I don't really need python to interact with Excel though, I want to use python to skip the Excel part entirely. I use excel mainly for the VBA part and easy to produce visuals. Is it maybe possible to run a server with python and turn my projects in webapps instead? I think I can install python (no admin rights, but we have a kind of appstore), but I would really rather not. It is too many computers and I seem to be the only person willing and or understanding of installing stuff.
I can't really say in your case but you can check the shiny documentation.
Learning how to use sqlalchemy and alembic.
Cool! Thank for kind words.
Hmm, that sounds promising! I will definitively look in to that. Thanks!
* pynsist * pyinstaller * nuitka * py2exe * py2app probably many more but those are the ones I remember off the top of my head. pynsist I remember being pretty good, nuitka I've used for a few projects distributed to win/mac/linux endpoints.
You have a typo -- replaced o with 0...
Data is based on projects hosted on semaphore's CI service. There is another similar breakdown based on projects on github, which was released much earlier this year. IIRC, Py3 had a lot more weight to it.
/r/learnpython 
My apologies. Fixing typo still adds the +1 or +2 to the result. Using pycharm. I am assuming you can't do math with .count () result.
Want some general advice? Start learning SQL, stop with the excel crap. You need a central database and not hundreds of excel files linked to each other. Osisoft PI uses SQL (Microsoft SQL Server to be precise). So start with SQL, set up a database, learn about data normalization, start converting your most important excel documents and go on from there.
The virtualenv command only creates virtualenv, and you don't use it to switch between envs. So the env is created with selected python version and when activated by f.i. `source ./path/to/env/dir/bin/activate` is always pointing to python version used during creation.
IMHO that doesn't even scrape the surface of "Python used in commercial projects".
It's not clear to me what you want to do. The code I see above will count the number of 'a' in the string, 'b' and add 1, 'c' and add two, and then add those 3 numbers together? 
Also, I presume it's sumtotal=numtotalone+numtotaltwo+numtotalthree instead of sumtotal=numtotalone+sumtotaltwo+sumtotalthree
So x_sp and y_sp are some kind of constant, and xx and yy are each element in the mesh grid one at a time? 
Did you vectorize your code or it in multiple for loops?
Lol sorry. I typed it instead of copy paste . The reddit copy paste formatted weird. 
Oh god, so helpful!!! Nope.
Cython is great, but if you have well written numpy, cython is not better.
Thanks for your advice. I think SQL might not be my best option in this case though. My excel files are more shaped like applications than hundreds of workbooks overflowing with data. Like the part where I need to use PI for; Get current values, do a (predetermined) polynomial equation based on thousands of datapoints to predit what the current value will be tomorrow. So it is very very light on data, but it relies on PI add-ins. And I have a lot of trouble keeping the add-ins installed properly on each computer. And the other excel files also are mostly light on data, but calculate or perform other tasks to make work life a bit easier. 
Thanks! I will look in to those. Py2exe was already mentioned in another reply too. I think I'll start with that one.
sorry, this monitor sucks and wont scale correctly. if I add a char as (name) it says the total is 2 (i am entering only 'm') should be zero. its a simple cipher, if you will. I assign a value to each character the person enters like a=1 b=2 etc. So I was going to count() each character and assign (like a +1, b +2) etc to each character then add them up and give a total number count. The word entered is worth X many number/value.
If OP is using numpy.meshgrid then it's possible to do a one line statement like they provided. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.meshgrid.html I imagine the x_sp and y_sp are what's changed in the "10,000 loops". Regardless, I'm assuming OP means that the line of code they provided is called tens of thousands of times over the course of the execution and thus, being 13 seconds on each call, is their problem. I'm gonna have to agree with billsil on the multithreading. Numpy is quite optimized and I would imagine there isn't a much faster way or working with meshgrids than by using the numpy meshgrids. I would look into thread pools and or something similar and if that's not enough, maybe look into doing operations on your graphics card. Graphics card are made to do grid/vector calculations. However I wouldn't be able to point you in a direction to do this using Python as I've never done it. 
I'm thinking you want to assign a value of 2 to B, 3 to C, etc. In your script, if the user enters the word 'ABCABBBCCCCC', it will count two A's, four B's, and six C's. numtotalone = 2 numtotaltwo = 4 + 1 = 5 numtotalthree = 6 + 2 = 8 You probably want the second variable to be 8, and the third one to be 18. Multiply the "count" values by 2 and 3 and you'll get the answer you expect.
The way I understand it.. What you're trying to do: Assign a number to each letter. Calculate the total "score" of whatever user inputs. Example: If the score of 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, 'c' is 2, then the input "Blue", converted to lower case ('blue') would be worth 1 point (d-z are worth 0) Your code: # https://www.ideone.com/lt9ltj name=input("What name or word?") print('you entered ' + name) name = name.lower() aCount = name.count('a') bCount = (name.count('b') + 1) cCount = name.count('c') + 2 # this works too sumtotal = aCount + bCount + cCount print('{} + {} + {} = {}'.format(aCount, bCount, cCount, sumtotal)) What it does: It adds nothing (0) to the count of 'a', 1 to the count of 'b', and 2 to the count of 'c'. If there are no 'b' in the input, the 1 gets added anyway! Here's how you can fix it.. # https://www.ideone.com/cJSjA6 name=input("What name or word?") print('you entered ' + name) name = name.lower() aScore = 0 * name.count('a') bScore = 1 * name.count('b') cScore = 2 * name.count('c') sumtotal = aScore + bScore + cScore print('{} + {} + {} = {}'.format(aScore, bScore, cScore, sumtotal)) Do we have to type out each score like that? Not really. Lists/Dictionaries to rescue! # https://www.ideone.com/MusIBY from string import ascii_lowercase name=input("What name or word?") print('\nYou entered:', name) # Make a scoring table where 'a' has score 0, 'b' has score 1 ... 'y' has score 24, 'z' has score 25 letterScores = {char: score for score, char in enumerate(ascii_lowercase)} # Calculate the score of user's input name = name.lower() totalScore = 0 for char in name: score = letterScores[char] print('{}: {}'.format(char, score)) totalScore += score print('Total score:', totalScore) 
The last thing that I want is off-by-one errors in my date calculations!
Yay
Could you share the code? Or atleast the part that does the printing and your process of mutli threading?? 
Multiprocessing, not multithreading, but yes. My rule of thumb is I get 2/3 processor utilization on physical cores. I haven't checked if hyperthreading matters with numpy, but it's worthless on AWS for a CFD problem which takes a week to run with 1000 cores. The `r_i` variable name is incredibly suspicious. All the statements can be interpreted either way. The graphics card idea is good (pycuda), but that's like a bulldozer when you need a hammer and you probably still gotta vectorize it. Python is amazingly fast when you do it right. It's a factor of 500x.
What about this kind of loop: for number in range(26): totalScore += number * name.count(chr(number + 97))
thanks, this explains it much better. Tutorials don't cover the intricacies of what to do with a .count() after receiving results. ( I assumed because "python" was simple you could mess with the results after receiving the count on the same line.)
by the way we *do* allow internet access for free users. it's just restricted to a whitelist. most popular SMS platforms (like twilio) are included on our whitelist already, and if you're using a different one, we'd be happy to add it: https://www.pythonanywhere.com/whitelist/
Works perfectly fine, but not something you would want to present in front of someone who is learning to program. If you wanna make it a one liner, you could always do print('Score:', sum(ord(c)-97 for c in input('Enter a name/word: ').lower()))
Do you actually run those cfd experiments? Are there good cfd software with Python interfaces?
I'm not quite sure what you mean by vectorizing. What do you mean by that?
Great! Just a small tip: Online tutorials really do not cover the material properly. I would suggest you to get a high school level programming book and start with that. Unlike most subjects, when you're beginning to learn programming, the best way is to be spoon-fed the knowledge!
Many thanks. I figured there was a much much better way but I have a habit of testing different things as I come across them to see what happens and why
Yes, I agree with that. At least in the beginning. As in most courses that I saw sooner or later chr() and ord() is thaught.

It would be interesting to see the difference of use of python 3 vs python 2 on GitHub.
long have we waited!
Let's say I have a 2d array of x locations and I want to add 1 to each. I could make a double for loop of I can just add 1. Vectorization gets rid of if and for loops and speeds up numpy. Oh, but I need to do something fancy like find the N unit vectors from an Nx3 array.. Numpy.linalg.norm has an axis parameter that let's you get an length N array out. Then you need to broadcast divide out the length to get the unit vector. Oh, but some of those initial vectors lengths are 0, so the value I want is 0 not nan, so I need an if loop inside my for loop. Alternatively, find the nans afterwards by using where and set them. There are functions in numpy that are very useful when vectorizing code (where, searchsorted, arange, tile, h/vstack). That are not so useful outside of heavily vectorized code 
DSLs are one of the best way of narrowing the solution space within which you are allowed to model your problem. Managing complexity is one of the key tasks that programmers engage in, and when the solution space is narrow, the complexity decreases. I wish there were more pythonic solutions to implement DSLs in Python because of how useful they are. Besides what space_president mentioned, Matlab is a DSL that has essentially supported the scientific/engineering community for decades. 
I do run CFD. There is an unsanctioned python openfoam library (pyfoam I think) out there, but my proprietary scripts are generally more useful. Paraview has a python API, but never really used it. Mostly I use Fun3d and extract a few pressure tap locations (a csv file) and plot them in matplotlib or time slices and post them in the open-source gui I wrote (aptly named pyNastran). It's no Paraview, but I don't need to do a file conversion step.
&gt; Like the part where I need to use PI for; Get current values, do a (predetermined) polynomial equation based on thousands of datapoints to predit what the current value will be tomorrow. Pandas and dataframes are the "data science" way to do this. O'Reilly has a "Python for Data Science" book that might be worth looking into.
"Python 2.7 was released 7 years ago in July 2010, and the end date for long-term support (LTS) maintenance period has not yet been decided, since the majority of projects are still using it." Article writer gives the wrong impression, the date for the EOL will be the last binary release for 2.7 which isn't known yet at which date specifically in 2020 it will happen, but it will happen in 2020. Not because " the majority of projects are still using it". https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2017-March/147664.html, http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/
+1 this book is awesome, both for reading through and referencing back later on.
What's changed to where this is finally a v1 after so long?

Step 1: Get the data structured and normalized into simple, consistent SQL tables. Step 2: Build an interface to the data. This could be an intranet web app (Flask/Javascript), desktop app in C# or Java, Access app, whatever. It's easy to get started with a web app. Access might be easier for this job, if you have that kind of shop and people like working with that sort of tool. It's up to you. Step 2.a: Start with simple forms for simple, no-frills, direct data entry. Get that working. Proof of concept. Step 2.b: Start building the business logic that transforms data on entry (form validation, calculations, etc.). Duplicate all existing essential functionality. Step 2.c: Need user validation, credentialing, role-based access, etc.? Start working on that now. Step 2.d: Clean up your UI. Make it clean, simple, consistent, and attractive (but not fancy). Just use Bootstrap. Step 2.e: Test, test, test. Step 3: Release a "beta" to select users. Step 4: Let them destroy your work, offer feedback and bugfixes. Remove your ego from the process, they'll be ruthless. Step 5: Fix users' concerns. Step 6: Release a QA version. Invite more users to use. Step 7. Repeat step 5. Step 8. Release product, slowly replace current solution. This may require a little double-entry while kinks are worked out.
In the case of pyglet, you can also just extract it right into your project folder. No installation retired.
Anyone privy to the situation: &gt;63.7% of people use Python 2.7., which is 8.2% less than last year. Is that an 8.2 *percent* decrease (i.e. down from 69.4%) or less 8.2 *percentage points* (i.e. down from 71.7%)
EDIT: It works ONLY if you write script on time. When I used this, the AMA started early and I hadn't finished the script in time :(
Off the wall question here: I'm a self taught programmer, but I like learning real software engineering theory. How do you come across concepts like domain deconstruction, i.e. traditional classroom education, on the job exposure, etc.
&gt;It’s not only about reassuring ourselves that the project fulfills business requirements. It also provides us with feedback on whether our system is not convoluted or coupled in some way. That kind of software tends to be hard to test. I don't need a test to tell me that the system is convoluted or overly coupled.
Why did you write the month numbers with a leading zero? It's not necessary in hex.

Fantastic write up man! I had no clue sympy would be this dope!
If - you have access to a server on which you can install python (and other dependencies/libraries you need) and run a webserver - user interaction is minimal, and 'simple' such as a user selecting a specific type of data (e.g. 'temperature of engine') and then clicking a 'refresh' button to see a predicted value based on historical data - you have no very super stringent non-functional requirements on e.g. security, speed, ... - have some time available to experiment and learn a bit Then personally I would not bother with py2exe and the likes but take the web-based app route... Using a so-called micro framework (e.g. flask, but there are others) it is relatively straightforward to quickly develop a such a simple web-based app and keep it under your control Given your desktop usage environment (80 people using 20 desktops, desktops being reset regularly) going for a 'desktop based' application will only lead to similar issues as you are now having (ensuring the right libraries are there after every reset etc...). **In short, you'll still be in support hell**
Maybe I should have worded it differently. I dislike any language (DSLs included) with less than 100 users in terms of business, and think that using it at a business is irresponsible. Languages are super cool and I'm fascinated by the beginnings of python in particular, but that's waaaay different than me having to debug some random parsing error when trying to set up some settings for some client because my old company is "too special for yaml"
Quick question: is there a specific reason why you implemented e.g. the proxy check with `if not self.proxy:` followed by `if self.proxy: ` instead of doing `if self.proxy: ... else:`? I couldn't spot any bugs when overlooking the code right now, but I can have a closer look later and maybe do a pull request. As for the if/else syntax, I'm mainly asking because if that is your coding preference, I wouldn't want to change it just in order to 'contribute' :)
Sorry, I misrepresented what I meant. I dislike any language that has less than 100 users (DSLs included) and think it's irresponsible to use them in business. When I see a post about how to make DSLs I imagine all the new programmers that are going to go to their jobs and pitch management on how much easier things would be if they had "a special config format for client X instead of old yaml", which will then break and cause me pain
Hi, thx! About if / else with proxy case: if answer in short way - no reason, your construction is better, obviously. I wrote this things (if proxy situation and in not proxy situation) in different times, and forgot united it in one if / else block.
We have servers. My ideal situation would be to have the webapps available on our local intranet. Not sure if IT likes stuff developed inhouse. But at the very least I could let it function as a proof of concept and get it developed more professionaly. I already have one (excel) application of mine being recreated by SAP. In SAP itself. User interaction is minimal enough I think. Most interaction I need is some lines of data being inserted by the user. I think that would be possible? Security is a very high priority, but having it hosted on a local intranet might be okay. I have lots of time. Granted, most of my work would have to be done in my free time, but I want to do this for my own development and satisfaction. Just like how I knew barely anything about excel and now am the goto excel *guru in the company.
Thanks! I will look into those! Python seems more attractive the more I learn about it.
This high usage of 2.7 is a disgrace. Especially since it explicitly states "new commercial projects".
That is a really good step by step basis to roll out my first project! Thanks. I will keep this bookmarked for sure.
I think we may have sample bias in this community.
Given your feedback, I would definitely go for the web-app route... Your biggest challenge will probably be getting the IT guys on-board or at least sufficiently supportive to provide you with a (non-production at first) server to play around with... And yes, you can have users provide input on webpages, that is not an issue in itself. One question though, does that provided input need to be stored for later use or is it just to drive the calculation and can it be discarded? If the former, you'll also need, next to the micro framework, some kind of (preferably simple) database / storage possibility, 
Thank you very much. I messaged the API to the customer service and they responded positively.
Alright! Very nice to have a sense of direction :) Thanks! IT will be a challenge for sure. I do 'know' them from other projects, so that door is at least a little bit opened up already :) The provided input is (for the projects I currently want to convert) indeed one-time use and used for calculations. Let's say it needs to calculate with 30 lines of data, pick/filter out x amount of lines of data, and present them back to the user. But that's variable storage I guess. No need for a database I would think. Thanks for your help :) Really appreciate it!
You might even think about setting up a php server and using mysql. You can write up simple forums that can be accessed through any web browser on your network. 
I feel that we are missing some information here. Why aren't you just pressing the \ or [] keys? What device and OS is this?
Well, good luck and above all have fun doing it And oh yeah, become a regular at /r/learnpython
I brought my towel. It's OK.
Just look at the amount of work and number of contributors. This is why Python will be the go-to for scientific computing for a long time, simply replicating the effort in a new language would take years - years during which Python will continue to improve! And years during which this great community will continue to grow :)
Nvm, I don't know why but ALT GR works. Dunno why its the only program I have to use ALT GR to write \ or [] though since in every other program ctrl and alt works totally fine.
Sounds like google foobar
Also, any programs doing non-astronomical computations (literally or figuratively) can always be improved with better hardware, and luckily academics usually have decent budgets/access to that sort of thing.
That's great news! Up until recently, there were just too many important CPython extensions to make PyPy actually worth the effort. But this is steadily changing. I think I'll have to take PyPy for a spin!
CreateMessage is not part of the standard library, it's either your own code or from a third-party library. If it's your own code, fix it: `as_string()` (or `str(message)`) returns text, while `as_bytes()` (or `bytes(message)`) returns bytes, and in Python 3 `base64` is a bytes-&gt;bytes encoding, so it needs to be fed bytes.
So what happens if more than one person uses the script?
Think about high frequency stock trading. The server closest to reddit wins. Haha.
I posted about my 'familiar face' project last time, i am new to python and have never actually deployed a flask project so I took this opportunity to try using pythonanywhere for the first time. I also had never used bootstrap before so I tried using it to spruce up how my project looks. Check it out here: http://fredfries.pythonanywhere.com/ The only thing I would say I have to do is to make the end results sorted by the air year of the movie/show. Now I am working on another project using Google's QPX Express API to track airplane ticket prices since I am planning on going on vacation soon. I want to also use mailgun api to shoot myself an email if the prices reach a certain price. So far my project searches for flights given origin city and destination city. Then it creates a folder with this template 'origin-destination' and it then puts all the relevant data into a csv file with the date as a name like so : 'MM-DD-YYYY'.csv. I have it set up on Windows 10 with task scheduler so it runs every day at 7AM taking args that are passed with sys.argv to create a new file every day. Next, I plan on implemented my csv datas into panda and maybe using bokeh to visualize the data and maybe email myself a line graph of the prices every week. I do wish I could make this into a flask app and put it on pythonanywhere as well but I am sort of new to this stuff and am currently trying to learn how to use databases.
It has been some years since I ran cfd simulations, I wasn't even aware of open foam. Thanks!
aesthetics
Thanks again for your help! I will sub right away. 
As always, let me know if something is confusing or that you think is wrong so I can edit and or clarify. Want to make sure this post can help and explain.
Use mode w+ to write+append to the file handle.
I can do my best to help some per my school schedule, just pm me
Oh very cool, thank you for that explanation. I'll have to make sure I vectorize my code more. I use numpy and pandas on large data sets at work on a regular basis
Super cool! Did you just pull them from the Zillow API?
I don't like it, if you are going to go hex, I'd say go all the way. Other than that, the design is really cool.
/r/learnpython will help.
From another source actually.
I can almost guarantee you it is a concurrency issue. sys.out and print are not thread safe. You can either implement a mutex lock around your prints or make a thread exclusively for printing with a asynchronous print queue. 
Continuous incremental progress... I love this package. scipy.signal in particular. My favourite object, however, is scipy.spatial.cKDTree. So very nice for querying nonuniform data sets... 
Does that means that now pypy is at least as fast as cpython when interfaced with c libraries ?
For a newbie, is there a straightforward way to update my existing scipy install?
in case you do not want to reinvent that wheel: https://www.fullstackpython.com/object-relational-mappers-orms.html
Do an AMA so we can test it.
Painful
yes you can install via `pip install scipy --pre` for prereleases BUT! If you can wait another week or so, it's going to be released officially and for the first time windows users can also directly install `pip install scipy. There is ridiculous amount of time and effort went into this issue. 
 pip install scipy --upgrade 
 INSTALL.rst.txt painful
as I mentioned above, wait for a week and the pain will (hopefully) go away. 
I would suggest looking at the pony library. It offers a way to interact with databases with syntax similar to sql queries in the form if python generators. 
Can windows users not install normally? I only upload source to pypi!
second solution seems good, thanks, will try it
&gt; simply replicating the effort in a new language would take years - years during which Python will continue to improve While I am very, very happy to see python gaining traction in scientific computing and analysis, this is the same argument against python and for matlab. With that said, I would take python over matlab 95% of the time!
this won't get the prereleases or development versions until version 1.0.0 comes out.
They can't since official builds require proprietary software for the build chain. In version 1.0.0, we finally found a way out with open source tools thanks to OpenBLAS.

Yeah, for its smaller footprint alone. If that's not enough of a reason try using Matlab on Linux! 
I'm on OSX, or whatever they call it now, so could i use the method JayTurnr described?
But 0.2 is not the same as 0.20. from distutils import version a=version.StrictVersion('0.2') b=version.StrictVersion('0.20') assert not (a == b) assert (b &gt; a)
Matlab on linux works great?
Just yesterday at work we were talking about compiling our own wheels for windows. This saves us a lot of time and effort.
I definitely don't want to reinvent _this_ wheel. I was actually expecting this project to be nothing more than a syntactic sugar over those ORMs. Thanks though, the link actually contained some ORMs I didn't know about so I'll have to see which one meets my needs best.
it was a joke :) 
Aside from the fact that libraries already exists for building sql queries, I would say that I find method chaining to be quite nice in certain circumstances. Pandas in a library that really runs with the style, and I've used it plenty so I don't mind it myself. Typically, though I'll wrap it in parens, so your example would be something like data = (sql .SELECT(col_names) .FROM(table_name) .WHERE(func) ) This, to me, makes it easier to modify (don't need to remember trailing slashes), prettier (don't need trailing slashes at all), and makes the block collapse nicely in pretty much every editor.
I consider myself whooshed then.
At the bottom of the page, you can find the wheels for windows. Could you please test them? We appreciate all kinds of feedback.
Hahah I love this 
I have never used SQLAlchemy and it looks to be a bit more full-featured than I would typically reach for in my toolkit, but that's most likely my lack of experience with the library. I'm sure any SQL module would work as long as you are able to get your INSERTs, UPDATEs, and DELETEs through.
Can you give a little more information, like maybe an example of an example of the resp that you get for your example request? &gt;When using parameters since or end, the order parameter automatically assumes the value ASC. When using the since parameter the maximum time that can displayed is 1 week. This note in their API documentation kind of leads me to believe using "since" means "order" is ignored. It also means you can only see one week into the past (so results for a "since" value over one week of time will return results capped at maximum one week old). 
Sure there are improvements, I'm just wondering why (or which of) these improvements was the motivation behind finally hitting v1.
I suspect semaphoreCI doesn't know the difference between a "new 2.7 project", and a 2.7 project newly using semaphoreCI. But I agree. No reason in 2017 to be starting new projects with 2.7. Or 3.3 for that matter, that's a pretty weird bit of data.
Write a program that calculates the total of the following series of numbers: Note: Using nested loop structure is mandatory for the complete mark! 1 20! + 2 19! + 3 18! + ⋯ + 20 1! i need help with that. i know ! is the factorial but do i have to break it down into decimal form and then calculate the factorial for each and then add it all together? pretty sure i am wrong. help would be appreciated .
There's no kill like overkill, they say. 
not yet: the branch mentioned in the blog post is not merged yet; moreover, there are still lots of improvements to do. But yes, we are confident that the path we have taken is promising, so we should be able to reach this goal with a reasonable amount of effort.

Why do you have the word devops? But yeah, if you're light on development, I wouldn't quite call that devops anyways. And it sounds like that's the direction you'd like to take, so you could embrace it. The devops engineers I've worked with all have strong backend development skills, and it will overall make you more valuable. You could look up on e.g. Glassdoor specific pay rates. As for how long it takes, it needn't take any longer than you've already been working, if for example you're applying at a new company for a development role, you could show your development experience. But if you don't feel you have enough yet, focus on writing tests, and making small projects that demonstrate specific skills.
&gt;The following functions in scipy.misc are deprecated: bytescale, fromimage, imfilter, imread, imresize, imrotate, imsave, imshow and toimage. Most of those functions have unexpected behavior (like rescaling and type casting image data without the user asking for that). Other functions simply have better alternatives. There's an alternate way to save/read images in SciPy?
It's only concerned with breakdown of Python *versions* used, not a full treatment of "Python used in commercial products".
Any chance of a PyCharm plugin? Or does PyCharm already do this?
If you're going to write applications in Python which store data, then you're going to be using some sort of database. At my job, for example, I write internal Django apps to replace workflows which previously used spreadsheets. (And to replace other outmoded software for lab testing.) SQL isn't often used by itself. Normally you write a client which interacts with it. Look into Django -- it's about as fast as you'll be able to get moving with the sort of things you'll want to do. If you're not ready to invest that much time (with 80 employees, I don't know how you couldn't), then maybe you should consider Microsoft Access/LibreOffice Base. That, at least, is a step up from Excel. (It stores things in databases, but allows you to make custom forms and queries/etc.) That, at least impose some order and consistency on your data, and could help prepare you for a day when you're ready to invest in a more permanent solution.
"big-ish data", article aside, that's a great name. 
Then I suggest https://pro.whitepages.com
I hate the word devops because it seems to get spammed so much these days, we don't advertise our roles with the word devops anymore because devops seems to be heavily misrepresented.
That would be a game-changer for PyPy! Very glad to hear of your progress! 
Ah, didn't think about parentheses! I think I'll make it on top of other ORM libraries, so I won't have to reinvent the wheel :)
&gt; from IPython import display
Misrepresented how, though? And what then do your roles entail? Perhaps it's not really devops then?

If you only need to know whether two points in a graph are connected you can use a simple DFS or BFS algorithm starting at either point and looking for the other. Just mark the nodes visited when you visit them and don't visit them again.

Working on a implementation of C#'s Linq in python just for the fun of it. Have all the most used Linq methods added and working already. It's also very loosely based on another implementation I found called "pylinq". Here is the source for mine : https://github.com/sharkbound/Python-Projects/blob/master/Linq/Linq.py Still working on some of the more complicated Linq methods
[Permanent](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-permanent-links-to-files/#press-y-to-permalink-to-a-file-in-a-specific-commit) GitHub links: * [sharkbound/Python-Projects/.../**Linq.py** (master → a7ac6d0)](https://github.com/sharkbound/Python-Projects/blob/a7ac6d056a09000e6e9262298c2135f208ec5b5b/Linq/Linq.py) ---- ^(Shoot me a PM if you think I'm doing something wrong.)
Sounds very interesting. Would love to see it in action
There's a good brief explanation in the article, under "tl;dr".
It's like a Git repository, but without any branches.
This might not be a valid approach for your problem, but I figure it's worth mentioning. It looks like your code is computing a Euclidean distance (or norm of an error vector, or something mathematically equivalent). Would your problem permit the use of the distance squared? In other words, can you simply omit the square root? For example, if you're looking for the nearest object, the minimum distance is the same as the minimum distance-squared. Certainly doesn't apply to all uses, but it's a helpful simplification when it does.
This is similar in form to a "fluent API", in which mutators return `self`, so that several mutations can be invoked on an object in a single chained statement (like `label.set_text("foo").set_color('red').set_font(12)`). This is not necessarily *un*Pythonic, but it is not typical for Python libs. Most use constructors with keyword arguments, so that an object can be created with a single method call, and only the relevant properties would be defined based on the keywords provided. Personally I like the fluent API, my earliest exposure to it was with Smalltalk in the early 90's. I wrote a data table library called `littletable` a few years ago using a fluent API - you can download it from pypi using pip, and see if you find it helpful. (It does not construct SQL, instead it works on a semi-structured list of objects.)
There is a separate pip like program for pypy and it has a reduced offering compared to normal python.
This is a really good analogy
You can add it as a Python command in the `Run` menu, and then run it from there when needed.
Python is SUPER hot in the SF Bay Area right now. Including remote jobs.
SQL isn't the best option to build forms or an application (I'd say it's one of the worst for that) that's what you use Python for. But you'll need SQL for the database that Python will access and read/write to. "I need a database for Python?" Yes, if you want concurrent access to your data. Right now you must have some "master" Excel file(s) that only one person can access at the same time right? Well that goes out the window when you start using a real application with a database. Just follow /u/be_bo_i_am_robot step-by-step list to get going and we'll see you in /r/SQL in a bit.
"not really devops" isn't really meaningful because "devops" has a million definitions. A lot of devs take devops to mean sysadmin/ops + CI/CD, which is... A really small subset.
* Web apps in Flask (I do this professionally) * Automation (e.g. pull articles from your favorite news sources automatically everyday, automate stuff with IFTTT, write an Amazon price tracker for your wish list to alert you when things go on sale) * System management (e.g. organize your photo library, resize or move files based on certain criteria, fix tags in your mp3 files, create an automated backup script for your documents) (I do this occasionally) * Download your bank statements and automatically parse them into Excel sheets for convenience during tax prep (I do this every year)
I love this style but it's not pythonic. I've tried to introduce it into python code bases because it was something I liked about Ruby, and it was always roundly rejected by experienced python devs.
These are in my `~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py` c.InteractiveShellApp.extensions = ['autoreload'] c.InteractiveShellApp.exec_lines = ['%autoreload 2'] Yeah, sometimes there are conflicts, but nothing a restart doesn't fix. Beats restarting all the time. Beyond `ipython`, pretty much just a repl and a whole bunch of tests.
You go from "guy who writes code" to dev as soon as you convince someone to pay you for being a dev. You're overthinking it. If you see a job you want and think you could do, apply for it.
If you don't want to automate it. If you don't like right-clicks (macOS/2017b). If you don't have a HiDPI display (linux). If you don't want to use it on the command line (windows). If you don't like multi-threading. If you have a blessed GPU stack (linux). If you don't like scrolling Live Scripts (macOS).
This is really dope!
This is a question I'm also struggling with. What I usually end up doing is, let's say we use class A from module a. While also working on class B. But we need to reload A. I'd go to the file a.py and evaluate A manually, even though it was imported before. This allows me in this instance to make changes to code in A and B (reevaluating the code that changes in those files). It's also a bit of a hack, but I find myself then making more and more changes to A anyway.
I don't know any right now but you could always try subprocessing the gpg2 executable and interface with the stdin/stdout pipes
How can I get scipy to build successfully? This may be a new issue with OSX Yosemite since I just upgraded and haven't had issues installing scipy before. I was doing this after [google docs change margins](http://codinglio.com/forum/topic/how-to-change-top-and-bottom-margins-in-google-docs/) 
GREAT job. I'm going to give it a try. A few things: - I'll probably want to control wether or not an empty docstring raises a warning on a per project basis. - Most tools (pytest, mypyt, etc) accept also to put configuration in setup.cfg and tox.ini to centralize conf. - you'll need a CLI output mode in a machine friendly format and a pure python documented API so that IDE can integrate that. - suggestion of a valid docstring to fix the invalid one would be welcome. 
I run a script that does: 1) virtualenv pip uninstall module -y 2) virtualenv pip install /path/to/source 3) run through test 4) reach IPython ; IPython.embed() -&gt; open REPL It's not the fastest thing in the world but if I get from start to REPL in under 5 seconds I'm pretty happy.
I've anticipated some of these concerns, and designed accordingly. I'm the to-do list on the Readme, I've included that I want to add a toml file of some kind. I suppose that setup.cfg or tox.ini would be good places, thanks for that suggestion. That will take care of all of the per project settings. I'll have to add an error code for empty docstrings -- that's a great idea. To be honest, while working on it, I intended for it to be used with pydocstyle. But if someone ignores the empty docstrings there, then darglint certainly shouldn't have to fail. I'll add this to the list. As far as types, darglint never requires them. Writes aren't only displayed if you have type annotations in the function *and* in the docstrings. I realize it isn't dry (and I made a note of that in the git commits and changelog.). However, I can see someone converting a project over to use type annotations. In such a case, warnings might be useful to check if the type descriptions (and probably, then, the argument descriptions) are out of sync with the code. I honestly considered not adding it, but it was relatively easy to add. As far as machine friendly cli output, it has that to some degree. When it displays an error it shows the file name, function name, line number, error code, and message all separated by colons. (I was trying to match pycodestyle as much as possible.) But some of the details about specific errors (like, which argument was out of sync) could be a little more standardized to make them easy to parse. You're suggestion made me realize that. Thank you for the input. I'll be sure to take all of these points into consideration.
From what I've seen, going the other way is probably a bit more lucrative. It's also pretty hard and takes a long, long time (a decade at least) to go from coding beginner to actually being good.
pip works on pypy. Some packages may not run on pypy (e.g. those using c-extensions), but that is not related to pip.
`pypy -m pip install pillow` will work if you have pip installed for pypy. If you don't have pip installed for pypy, see https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#installing-with-get-pip-py
/r/learnpython
Oh cool, thanks for correcting me. Last I remember using pypy (some years admittedly) I was using a different version of pip for whatever reason.
It could be said that the branches keep getting created and merged into one in real time (as new transactions keep coming, and miners process them), right?
Great project, I need to get serious and look into this.
/r/learnpython Also, you're trying to read from a closed file.
Would you mind correctly formatting the code above, ' if line == username:'? =]
SciPy decided to deprecate these functions as there are much better alternatives and there is not much point maintaining low-perfoming code. Hence `imageio.imread` and related imageio functions are recommended. See the first line [in develeopment docs](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/misc.html) in each function.
1 - def number_of_x(string): return len([letter for letter in string if letter == 'x'])
No need. SQLAlchemy has exactly that. You wouldn't not add any value
Good idea tho
Can you link us to the code? It's hard to see from that image.
&gt;What am I doing wrong? You're posting a thumbnail.
Alright, I've made a pull request with some modifications: - Instagram URL matching with regex - only parse XML config once - the if logic at some places Please test it if it's still providing the functionality, but it should :)
&gt;What is wrong with this code It looks like something that logs users in and it's a text file in plain text. Also you close the files on the first loop. Try to use with syntax.
Nice. Btw, if you're going to use /tmp as cache dir, you'll still lose when your battery runs empty?
Important to note, if you try to merge conflicts, the longest chain wins.
I just updated my midi file parser to python 3. Complete rewrite. https://github.com/maxmcorp/mxm.midifile
k, so what happens if my bitcoin transaction belonged to the chain that lost? Will it keep showing as pending and be later added in a next block after miners take it again?
Wow, that's a bigger task then a couple of paragraphs in /r/python would probably do much to help you. What have you done to break this down into smaller tasks? I'd suggest working on a piece of this at a time. Search for the different pieces and I'm sure you'll find some good info on similar projects that have already been done.
Interesting, thanks for sharing! &gt; Doing the pip install/uninstall also means that MANIFEST.in gets tested implicitly, which is good if you've got jinja2 templates in the module or something. Is that why you don't just pip install --editable path/to/source?
Nice! How did you find the process of doing the rewrite, any tools or tricks you found particularly helpful? 
It was pretty painless. Biggest difference was using bytes instead of python 2 strings, as there is a lot of binary io and bit manipulation in the code. But bytes actually made the code a lot clearer. The only pain point was parsing a byte as an 8 bit integer with values from -128-128 using twos complement. That works poorly with Pythons integer type. I used Visual Studio Code and doctests. I really like doctests :-)
import random while True: lvl=1 Health = 10 +(lvl*0.5) strength = 5 Weapon = 0 X= 0 done = 99 Warrior = 0 Archer = 1 Sorcerer = 2 while True: if X==1: print ("hej") break elif input (done): print ("selected") X== X+1 elif input (Warrior): Health== Health +5 Weapon== Weapon +5 strength== strength +15 elif input (Archer): Health== Health+5 strength== strength+10 Weapon== Weapon+10 elif input (Sorcerer): Health== Health+1 strength== strength+5 Weapon== Weapon+15 else: print("welcome, choose charracter", "Warrior, Archer, Sorcerer") while True: exp = 0 expnd = lvl*100 if exp&gt; expnd: lvl== lvl+1 if input (exp): print ("exp",exp) if input (lvl): print("level",lvl) if input (Health): print(Health,Health) if input (lvl): print("level",lvl) if input== Weapon: print(Weapon,Weapon) if input== strength: print(strength,strength) 
I'm quite new to python
/r/learnpython is for questions, not here. 
I work in a Jupyter notebook with the following in the first cell: %load_ext autoreload %autoreload 2 
&gt; label.set_text("foo").set_color('red').set_font(12) I agree with your point. I much prefer to specify those parameters in constructor either in form of keywords arguments, or a dict. Using chained methods in OP example is somewhat justifiable, and also SQL Alchemy uses it, but I certainly don't want this technique to creep into more python libs.
Writing a script that will walk through my companies 30+ AWS accounts to check each user's access key age. If they are past a certain age, use SNS to alert our security team to contact the user to change out their access keys. Special considerations are being taken for application users and whether or not we should message the user directly and then automatically disable the account after an even longer amount of time.
Well thanks for nothing
Are you running your cmd as administrator?
Hmm. I'm going to sit with this metaphor. (Truth be told, git appears to be mysteriously magical to me at times. Git, not Linux, was the product of Linus Torvald's true genius, IMO.)
ETL work mostly, saw a weird pattern and that was more recently I've been using isinstance like a crutch, I counted for the small parsers I have been writing I have been filtering by type then paring it down after that a lot. I honestly don't know if it's the best approach but it seems logical. If it's nan, it's a float, if it's string a lot of the time it imported as unicode, int is usually just regular numbers...etc. 
Try using a break statement after you close the files. You won’t want the loop to continue after the files are closed.
Sure, here is an example call: {'32818000': {'amount': 3.4523848, 'is_your_order': False, 'order_id': 91668346, 'pair': 'taas_btc', 'rate': 0.0010195, 'timestamp': 1508414955, 'trade_id': 32818000, 'type': 'sell'}, '32818010': {'amount': 0.70536582, 'is_your_order': False, 'order_id': 91668346, 'pair': 'taas_btc', 'rate': 0.0010195, 'timestamp': 1508414962, 'trade_id': 32818010, 'type': 'sell'}, '32818019': {'amount': 1.56732619, 'is_your_order': False, 'order_id': 91668346, 'pair': 'taas_btc', 'rate': 0.0010195, 'timestamp': 1508414963, 'trade_id': 32818019, 'type': 'sell'}, '32818026': {'amount': 1.16745202, 'is_your_order': False, 'order_id': 91668346, 'pair': 'taas_btc', 'rate': 0.0010195, 'timestamp': 1508414965, 'trade_id': 32818026, 'type': 'sell'}} I actually did make some progress but in a roundabout way. I have been using 'from trade ID' and using sort, and it turns out that gives me a time sorted list after all! So now I am going to include a calibration function to find a trade ID that is within my 24-48hours ago let's say and use that as the reference when I pull new trades.

There's an idea in python that functions and methods should either mutate an argument or return a value, but not both. Compare `sorted` and `list.sort`. `sorted` takes a list and returns a new list that is a sorted version of the one it received. `list.sort` takes a list and sorts it in-place, returning `None`. The reason for this is that it makes it easier to know what is happening just by looking at the call site. There is a large difference in semantics between mutation and making a copy, and so it's useful to be sure which is which. That means that your api can only be pythonic if you're constructing new values to return every method call, and not just mutating and returning `self`. That's a necessary (though perhaps not sufficient) condition.

Ugh. A surprisingly useful article posted on a reader-hostile site. Why did Medium start to suck???
It's alright :) Turns out the author of the book PM'd me and helped me figure it out! He's a really nice guy :)
What did you do wrong? 1) you posted unreadable code 2) you didnt read the sidebar
Yeah, Eric is solid gold! I'm glad you got an answer, and I hope you subscribe over to /r/learnpython as well - it's a great resource, and a lot of people like Eric are over there helping out.
2 : ``` def sum(): retval = 0 num = input('Enter a number: ') while (num != -1): retval += num return num ``` Should work, I'm on mobile right now
Tip for 2: input can be read to a variable using `var = input('readable prompt')` - as for the loop, using a while() loop is the way to go here.
Are you sure that you want to assert `line == password` and not `line1 == password`, given that `line` seems to be the username?
It comes from (or at least I know it from) a [capture-the-flag](https://github.com/ctfs/write-ups-2014/tree/master/stripe-ctf3/level1) that Stripe put on a couple years back. In it you had to create git commits with the hash right to a certain level of difficulty to move 'gitcoins' around.

This is brilliant. Be sure to check out the animated screenshot demos.
It may. I usually pick other dir, often on external drive.
Why you think it's reader-hositle?
Adorable name.
This is where python really, really shines. Making quick prototypes of low-level stuff. Personally I use it for prototyping network protocols much more than I actually need.
Hello fellow biologist! I'm currently working on my Master's thesis which I'm mainly doing in python, and extra practice is always good. If you'd like I can also try to help, just pm me and I'll have a look when there's spare time!
Yep. A transaction doesn't care about the block or anything, it's literally just a note that "bob sent all the money he had from x y and z addresses to cindy" which is signed by Bob's private key. So as long as someone has that note they can add it to a block and get that sweet fee
Out of curiousity, is there a market for low skill python work? Unpaid of course. For example, when I wanted to improve myself as a voice actor, I did a ton of unpaid work on CastingCall. Is there any sort of demand for that? Just so I, and other learners, have practical applications to practice with. 
That or `ctypes` and the `gpgme` C library.
Awesome project! I'm fascinated by bitcoin and the technology behind it. 
What's the code meant to achieve? There's a few logic flaws which I'm trying to wrap my head around.
Sorry, I'm a bit of a noob when it comes to python, could you explain how I could implement the 'with' statement?
The with statement opens and closes when it's done. So instead of writing: file = open("welcome.txt") data = file.read() doStuff(data) file.close() write it like this: with open("welcome.txt") as file: data = file.read() doStuff(data) 
To be frank, you are asking for a complete solution and nobody here wants to do your work for you. I actually wrote something very similar to this. Only it didn't move a mouse cursor but a robot arm. It is open source, you should be able to find it.
The animated screen shots were awesome. Seems that wallaroo labs has some competition.
Thanks, I appreciate it :)
Since you're interested in security, have a look at the Electrum wallet, which was coded in Python.
Last I checked, SQLAlchemy does not have a nice ORM API like those on the linked page. What exactly are you referring to?
It's probably got to do with what `python` command Sublime is using. Make sure your build commands are correct. 
Interesting. I never noticed that distinction before. I'll keep that in mind -- thanks!
Is anyone doing anything interesting with Nuitka? It's been on my radar for years, but has always seemed more esoteric than broadly useful.
[Because](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/1.x/examples/notebooks/Part%205%20-%20Rich%20Display%20System.ipynb)
Cool little project. Thanks man!
What are you actually asking here? I don't understand what your question is... 
By way of sources, [here's guido talking about the concept](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2003-October/038855.html).
We used it to pack software on various platforms for delivery of cryptography app alongside our app
Sqlla doc copy / paste : select([users, addresses]).where(users.c.id == addresses.c.user_id)
Cool, glad you have made progress!
 When parallelisation with Dask is finished, this package is going to be a godsend for me.
Tabs master race. 
how about user's input, it'll require a user to type in their email and passphrase? whereas I want to use pgp with having user's email and passphrase stored in a config file.
This bit is basically a character selection for a D&amp;D style game. I'm very new to this so it'll definitely be odd
Jupyter Notebooks to hash out some functions. Then when it hits 'critical mass' make a module folder and dump everything into __init__.py and then clean up and refactor from there.
Our studio convention is tabs (3 spaces). 
Thanks for all the work you have been putting on this.. Love everything about it from the data streaming to the actual presentation on your blog. I do have a question and do feel free to ignore it if it's way beyond the use case(or dumb).. Will you also try and support statistical functionality.. for instance, things like (binomial, multinomial) regressions and algorithms of those kind? Also i am looking forward to contributing to your project.
Yeah, I stopped reading the article after the first point. They didn't even try to defend their stance.
Is it to generate stats based on the character class entered? Are you looking to use the script throughout the game or only at the start?
PEP 8. Spaces are the standard, like it or not. You're not missing out on much by not reading further though, it's basically just "this is how scoping works" and going over the edge cases.
This bit for only the start 
Hey there - I use Airflow for this, and I honestly think it's been the easiest thing for all skill levels to get running with. It runs reliably, is easy to modify myself, and is very reliable. The community is SUPER active. It also has connections to easily store passwords, and load data to typical destinations from typical sources. Check it out - https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow If you want, I'd be happy to answer any questions you have to help get you running.
PEP8 doesn't take a particularly strong stance on this. It states that spaces are "preferred" but strongly states that you should be consistent. (You have to be consistent in Python 3).
Thanks for the reply! So most people at my work are not experienced with scripting. This means that having a graphic interface to schedule jobs would be ideal. If this isn't possible, it will be up to me to manage all the scheduling. This would be acceptable but not ideal. I looked into airflow when I was first learning python but quickly gave up. If I set up a digital ocean linux server could I potentially schedule any scripts I write to run on that server? Is there any compatibility with Jupyter notebook if myself or other coworkers want to use that as a place to group our scripts? 
Opening the stream is a request -- not each tweet downloaded. However, typically, you would never open more than one stream, so the request limit is not important. When you use the REST API, for those requests there is a limit that you need to be aware of. For example, there is a limit to how many search requests you can make in a 15 minute window.
used it to distribute a toolset across linux/mac/windows. it was very easy to get going with and Kay was very responsive in helping and fixing. It was Python 3.5 compatible quickly.
Sounds like a recent request I saw on UpWork.
I'll help you via PM.
Oh man, sounds like something I need. I'm just unrolling a project at work that requires SFTP to servers within our data center. We weren't sure about using different accounts and changing passwords or trying out some 3rd party key manager. That's all new to me, but sounds close to what you've done. Guess I have to check out Boto3.
Here's the part of the documentation I used for the Access keys: https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/iam.html 
Have you taken a look at PySpark yet? It does many of these same functions.
&gt; All steps please No thank you
I also tried and failed at this. I now just export the unformated Excel export and deal with formating some other way. You could maybe use the exported Excel as a datasource for another properly formated file, of write a macro of some sort. If you find a way please post your solution!
Awesome! I've been toying with the idea of creating a modular "personal digest" api to aggregate news, weather, sports, blogs, personal goals, etc (hence the modularity). This might be the impetus I needed to get started, since the "ingest" part (what you've done here) is daunting! I'll let you know if I use this!
Yes. Most linux VM's should come pre-installed with Python. You can also code in the browser with the links below. LearnPython.org Codecademy.com https://repl.it/languages/python3 https://www.pythonanywhere.com/
I've used PySpark; the ergonomics from a python viewpoint are quite poor for anything sufficiently complex despite the relative maturity difference between Dask and Spark.
Working on remembering loops and iterations from memory instead of having to take a peak at code to remember. (It's my 3rd day learning python =) )
You don't. This code doesn't handle logging in to LinkedIn, it just scrapes a bit of data off of a company page. It doesn't provide any session cookies to LinkedIn and it doesn't fill any forms.
Did for a client but not through UpWork :)
Poorly written, no numbering or bullets 😐
Try the XlsxWriter Module for Python, i used it a few times and never had any problems, even with very large Data Sets. Hope it will work
"80 characters" is PEP8 too
&gt;Using a Mutable Value as a Default Value &gt;def foo(numbers=[]): &gt; numbers.append(9) &gt; return numbers This kind of problem is not acceptable. They will need to fix this.
Thanks @Dreieck,glad u liked it
Sure buddy,Thanks for appreciating the project /u/Konchshell
I inject python into a running process and then use Nuitka to transfer the state at python runtime into the process (before injecting / instrumentation).
Do you like Airflow more than Luigi?
Cron and pyinvoke would be a simple solution.
You have to be consistent in Python 2 too. If you mix up spaces and tabs, your code may not work properly. It's just Python 2 won't raise the indentation error, it'll raise a totally different error and if you are beginner you will have hell of a time trying to debug it.
I will have to take your word on that as I don't program in Python 2.
That's the one everybody ignores. People who religiously stick to PEP 8 will make an exception for the 79 character rule. Even Raymond Hettinger, Python core developer, says to ignore that one. 
Sadly I do, I program in Python 2.6 ;_;
Alright, my friend. I've been trying to scrape LinkedIn for AGES, and I just couldn't do it. I tried EVERYTHING I could find, and I just couldn't do it. I tried selenium webdrivers with beautifulsoup. I tried Scrapy with selenium. My question is very simple. When I try to scrape pages using the code above, I get null results because when I request the pages, all I get is a sign-in request. I want to sign in using Python before gathering specific items from the page. I'd have to login using http://www.linkedin.com/uas/login before I extract any kind of data. Maybe I could import Requests or something like that. I really don't know!
I know it doesn't, but is there a way to incorporate a session email and password using this code? I'd have sign-in using http://www.linkedin.com/uas/login. I can do it using selenium, but I don't know how to incorporate selenium into this code. Will it even work when import selenium or any kind of login keys or whatever???
I think I tried that once and it didn't work for some reason. *shrug* Maybe I should try it again. It only saves &lt; 1 second though.
There was a little work begun on this here: https://github.com/dask/dask-glm/ Not sure what the future state of that is though.
The floating bar above and below the text. That is bad enough on the desktop but on mobile, it's especially bad because there is also the "Open in app" blocking even more text, and on a smaller screen. 
I'm not sure how much experience you have with using motors with an RPi. What you'll need to do to get the motors working is to create a circuit like the ones mentioned [here](https://business.tutsplus.com/tutorials/controlling-dc-motors-using-python-with-a-raspberry-pi--cms-20051). After that, you can use the GPIO library to power the GPIO pins on the RPi. This solves your motor issue. Your next issue is the remote control part. You need to design a way of sending signals to the RPi remotely. I don't have much experience here, but you might be able to either buy a RF receiver, or do something simpler like controlling the PI directly through SSH. 
We have no experience. We have no experience with any of this kind of thing, we just thought it would be a fun thing to do.
&gt; They who? Python or the article? I was taken aback when I had this problem too. It seems like it is against the "obvious way to do it"
it's kind of a tangent, but have you ever looked at the [source code](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/6f0eb93183519024cb360162bdd81b9faec97ba6/Lib/this.py) for `import this`? It is obviously a joke, but it makes me laugh.
Spaam
Have have your tabs insert equivalent spaces. Blah. Also... 4-space-master-race!
I guess I don't get why you'd go to the trouble of getting a board like this and all the intricacies of setting up the development environment, etc., instead of just using a Raspberry Pi and a distro that has all that stuff internally all ready to go...
Yeah, I love it. I use this pattern everywhere I can. e.g. [here](https://github.com/crdoconnor/commandlib) and [here](https://github.com/crdoconnor/pathquery). It's got a number of advantages: * Avoids the telescoping constructor antipattern. * It's easier to maintain backwards compatibility. * You can make the objects pseudo-immutable (each method returns a copy with one thing changed) which makes the code a lot cleaner as you don't have to worry about state.
&gt; I certainly don't want this technique to creep into more python libs. Why not? It lends itself to very clean code.
Seeing as you are opening two files and checking values why not: username = input("What is your username? ") password = input("What is your password? ") with open('username.txt') as userfile, open('password.txt') as passfile: for user, passw in zip(userfile, passfile): if username == user and password == passw: print("You're logged in!") else: print("Incorrect") Some info as to what is going on here: `with` as others have mentioned allows you to use `open()`'s context manager which automatically handles opening and closing of files. The reason a `mode` ('r' etc) is excluded from the usage here is that `'r'` is the default mode anyway. As you can see it is possible to `with open()` multiple files at once, quite handy. Now on the next line I use the `zip()` function (which is built-in) to take multiple iterables (in this case the text files) and return an iterable which is composed of tuples of the values in each iterable: list1 = [1, 2] list2 = [3, 4] combined = zip(list1, list2) for pair in combined: print(pair) &gt;&gt;&gt; (1, 3) &gt;&gt;&gt; (2, 4) From their you just compare them, its fine to use just one `if` as on the first comparison (username) it will "short-circuit" if its wrong and jump right to the `else` but if both are correct print the login message.
I didn’t quite understand the article on this point. Is the issue that lists are mutable and that they don’t need to return it?
I see. The way I would approach this is to accomplish the task in steps. The first step is being able to get the motors to simply turn on and off. Your motors should have 2 wires, one being ground and the other being the power. You'll need to wire the ground to a ground pin on the RPi and the power pin to any GPIO pin on the board. I personally use [this site](https://pinout.xyz/) for pinout information. Once you do that, you can power up the board and look at something like [this](https://sourceforge.net/p/raspberry-gpio-python/wiki/BasicUsage/) to write up a quick script to toggle the pin. This should allow you to turn the motors on and off. The trouble is that your motors are not too controlled in this state. This is where some simple circuitry may help you out. Once that's in place, you need a way to talk to the RPi remotely, (the RC part of your RC car). There are a few ways I can think of doing this, but simplest would be to just ssh into the RPi and run the commands remotely. The gaming receiver might work, but you'll need a way of interpreting what is being sent to the Pi into motor commands. If you wanted to get really fancy, you might be able to use servos to turn the front wheels, allowing you to get turning functionality. I understand that I probably didn't explain this very well, so let me know if you have any questions. 
What's your OS? You have options for running Python without needing admin privileges. Check [winpython](https://winpython.github.io/). 
The idea was to only have one motor run on one side, simply to allow it to turn. It would be like paddling a kayak with two oars; if you paddle one, you turn that way (if that makes sense). You have explained it amazingly, that is a wonderful thing for you to do. Any question I have is, I believe this counts as; what if the motors don't have wires installed? Do we solder the wires or is there another way to wire them?
The issue is that the default is created when the function is defined, not when it’s called. So every time you call the function without a value, you are getting the same array again. Since you are modifying the array in the function, that default array floating around keeps growing, which is rather unexpected at first glance
Exactly what I needed! Thank you.
you are resetting correct_letters every loop. also please use r/learnpython.
Each iteration you are doing correct_letters = [] !
I think I understand. In that case, you may not have to worry about synchronising the motors. As far as the wiring is concerned, you might be able to get away with stripping one end and wrapping it around the motor connectors, but soldering will be a more secure solution. So long as there is a nice contact, you'll be fine. Make sure you know which side is ground.
Okay, that shouldn't be too hard. I think we dived into this without thinking too much about the consequences or the actual work that would be involved in this. 
Oh man, that used to be different. Used to be compressed with zlib.
I'm sorry.. didn't realize I was in the wrong sub should've double checked
So should I put the list outside the loop?
The truth is a lot of “Python” ML libraries use C or C++ under the hood and really just the API layer is Python. So Python is for the user friendly part while C++ does the dirty performance part. 
That's part of the fun!
If you could bypass it, so can the ddos'ers.
Hi H4xrk1m, Sorry for being vague. I am still new to the forums. Basically, I have been teaching myself to program to help at work. I understand some aspects of "push" and "pull", and to be very honest, I LOVE how simple Python is for me to learn, use and understand, but I want to make sure that I can use it for my intended purpose. We do a lot of 10-key and Data entry which gets VERY boring and I want to explore ways to automate the process and I wanted to make sure that Python was the best language for automation. I am still learning so am looking for experts or more seasoned professionals to help me shorten my knowledge gap to achieve my goal.
Praying to God that our pieces of wood and wire will hopefully work and that my shoddy wire-job won't kill us both? :P haha
At these voltages there's no risk of getting hurt. You guys can even touch the pins and be fine. Good luck!
Thanks. I'll hopefully be able to get a hold of my partner and gets his opinion haha.
Thanks, I will check this out
Spaces are preferred not standard, like it or not.
Right. I use spaces anyway and I was immediately turned off by the "Do it this way because I say so" attitude.
PEP 8 sucks though...
What if I like wide indentation? 7 spaces worth? The tab character was designed for indentation, customizable by each user. Use it.
You out the `-e` flag for [installing a package in "editable" mode](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs) It doesn't help with the REPL piece (see another comment about that), but it saves you having to pip uninstall/reinstall. 
Full Disclosure: I work at Google on the Cloud Platform. Yes, absolutely. You could use GCE to spin up a linux or Windows instance and use that; you could use Cloud Shell for short-term practice that doesn't need to be constantly on; or you could go the Platform-as-a-service route and use App Engine. Note that App Engine Standard has sandbox security measures that limit the use of some modules, so it may not work well for your intended purpose. Be sure to check out the Always Free docs so you can try things out without charge: https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/frequently-asked-questions#always-free
I put one of my most used gists into a library and I'm looking for feedback. The old version has been used in several of my personal projects and works really well. Let me know what you think!
I usually use requests to save the HTML locally. That way I minimize unnecessary requests to the web site when I'm working out the bugs. You should also be sending a user agent string. See this [stack exchange](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10606133/sending-user-agent-using-requests-library-in-python). Also, add a delay between each request. That will help disguise your requests as not being a bot. If a website has banned you, it is probably because they don't want you to scrape their site. Do they have an API that you can use?
Honestly - Haven't tried Luigi. It had a really solid set of connectors a while ago, but I think I just preferred the UI of airflow, and the method of organizing dags made better sense to me. 
So, I created an R shiny app with the table and filtering and though not written, I think I can even write something for the table to update. My problem is, when I publish the shiny app online, do you have any idea how can I retrieve this new saved data?
Interesting. good points.
Those are great points, and would be challenges with airflow. I'll try to answer your questions * **Graphical Interface to schedule**: I'm less familiar with tools like this, but maybe something like Talend or others would work. Here's a decent thread on those: https://www.reddit.com/r/ETL/comments/7615az/whats_a_good_modern_free_etl_tool_for_a_fresh/ * **Can you run on digital ocean** Definitely. It's very easy to get running. After installing the python program, you then write each job as it's own Python file, and drop it into a certain folder on the server to get picked up. * **Compatibility with Jupyter** Not that I'm aware of. That's been a challenge I've seen for some guys I work with.. There's no interactive IDE. Happy to answer any other questions. I've worked with Airflow for about 3 years in big/small orgs.
Sounds like Django Admin to be honest.
&gt;I guess I don't get why you'd go to the trouble of getting a board like this ... instead of just using a Raspberry Pi Mostly because a raspberry pi isn't deterministic like a microcontroller is, and because microcontrollers are better suited for dedicated tasks. You'd never do advanced motor control with a raspberry pi, only trivial stuff that isn't very time critical.
The iterative function works like this, it sets up a result placeholder and sets it to 1. Then it multiples that placeholder by 2 and stores it in result. Then with 3, 4, 5,etc until you hit the number you are trying to get the factorial of. Then the result is returned For the recursion, it makes a base case of 0 to handle the end of the recursion, then at the end of the function it returns the number given to it times the factorial of the number - 1, which will keep going until it hits zero, then you get a full answer returned 
Yup - otherwise, for every turn, your list will be set to [], meaning the loop will always exit with max turns even though the list will be empty
Yeah, thanks for your productive feedback. https://github.com/Anorov/cloudflare-scrape
Okay, so how exactly do you want this data returned? We have a list: [10,11,12] we'll say. Did you just want a list [10, 'Jack', 'Queen'] back? If I could recommend something, it would be to store the hand like this: [10, '10', 11, 'Jack', 13, 'King'] The reason I say this is because if you store the values as a list and remove the numbers, you'll have to go through a bit to get those values again. This would store the value of the card AND it's name, which makes it easy to return. There's a few ways you can go with this, but those if statements won't work since card is a list. 
Your recommendation sounds better and yes I just need it to say that 11 is a jack and so on. When it displays the max value it needs to say if it’s a jack or a queen etc. Although I have no idea how I would do that. 
Thank you, very handy :)

Tabs converted to spaces. 🤗🤗🤗🤗
There might be, but you shouldn't get involved with it if they're not paying. Even CS interns get like $30 an hour in DC. If you work as a programmer for free, you're becoming part of an exploitative practice that drives wages down for everyone and could potentially damage an industry that I assume you one day want to become a part of.
Would it be possible to run selenium on iOS? I installed StaSh and ran `pip install selenium` in it, then `from selenium import webdriver` and `webdriver.Safari()` but I got an error saying `SafariDriver requires Safari 10 on OSX El Capitan or greater`. Do you know any driver that would work on iOS?
ty :)
Totally. I'll post it on /r/Python when it's done (successful or not...ha!)
Consider the following... # Build an ordered list of card names. names = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 , 9, 10, 'Jack', 'Queen', 'King', 'Ace'] # Use dictionary comprehension syntax. # It uses a generator expression to populate a dict(). deck = {counter : name for counter, name in enumerate(names, 2)} # Creates a dict() as follows: # {2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4, 5: 5, 6: 6, 7: 7, 8: 8, 9: 9, 10: 10, 11: 'Jack', 12: 'Queen', 13: 'King', 14: 'Ace'} # Note the enumerate() function is a built-in function which adds a counter to an iterable. # In python, lists (such as your list of card names) are iterables, meaning you can loop # through them using for statements. # The enumerate() function takes two arguments here: the iterable (names), # and the starting number for the counter #Create a list of three random card values using list comprension syntax. random_three_cards = [deck[random.randint(2,14)] for number in range(3)] # Note that it is lke the dictionary comprehension syntax. # It is virtually identical, but it yields only one value from # each cycle over the the iterable (range(3), that is), rather than two. 
Can you go into more detail about how you do this?
How is it pronounced? Does it have or allude to some meaning? Sounds like a cute Russian name maybe? Nu-eet-Ka? 
This is named after his wife Russian Anuitka. Source: I listened to his interview on a podcast.
I really don't like spaces.
So one of the downsides of micropython is actually that it is not well suited for time critical applications either, like 100x slower than c code performing the same applications . It's a Python interpreter on a micro controller which has some advantages like the possibility of over the air updates to the file system, but how is this implementation better suited for "time critical applications"? 
For anyone who's found this looking for a solution to a similar problem- I'm sorry, but I ended up giving up on the problem for now in favor of just setting up the dependencies on our production machine manually. OpenCV was a problem even in that process and I'm sure it's causing the problems here. I suggest building OpenCV from source (as well as FFMPEG, perhaps), as this is what solved my dependency problems on the production machine. If I get back to this problem and solve it, I'll be sure to update this comment with the solution.
The difference is using hard tabs with user defined preference for display size let's everybody view code as they prefer. Which is obviously horrible. I'm with you, man. This is one of those things where one option is clearly better as it allows for everyone's preference, and the other option is basically, "fuck those people."
This is going to come in handy! Thank you very much. 
Holy. This is exactly what I need. Have been trying to use Plotly to stream my tank data, but it crashed, every damn time. Am using Thingspeak now, but would be nice to not rely on a 3rd party and do this on my on website.
You're assuming everyone is fine customizing their text editor just to work on code with you. I would see your convention and then not contribute to your project, or complain to the project lead if you were my coworker.
&gt; Is that a good tool to prevent this sort of banning in the future? The best tool is to RTFM. Follow the API if they have one, make sure you understand any rate limiting they may do on that front. If you can't find info, try to contact the admin. If none of that gets you an answer, and you go ahead and do it anyway, you've got what's coming to you.
Thanks for the comments so far. The screen that popped up for me after running the initial stages of my scraper showed distil as the bot blocker. I've done a little research and it appears that distil is breakable but I haven't seen any code out there to display it. I guess it's a trade secret for the programmers who can bypass it.
I think you're are going to find all you need here:[openpyxl and pandas](http://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/default/pandas.html). TL;DR Instead of writing from pandas, use openpyxl to open the workbook and append the rows of the dataframe using openpyxl. 
I'm already using the openpyxl engine. Not sure if using openpyxl directly will help.
This is so frustrating. There has to be a solution to this - 
Would you mind elaborating on DFS/BFS? 
If there were any functions that mutate integers, they would also be problematic, but there aren't, so they aren't. 
Basically, I need to login from multiple ids(19 to be precise).
honestly nevermind, its a piece of shit language hardly compatible with windows. Uninstalling and cutting my losses, fuck python.
I think I would use a DICT of DICT: an identifier of any website you go to, with value of a DICT, containing the username and password for this site.
One argument I have against tabs: they're less versatile and don't allow all styles of hanging indents. For example: ```python def f(long_long_long_var_name, another_var): pass ``` Personally I don't like this indentation style, but it's valid PEP8.
array of 2-tuples?
I would create a class that has username and password properties. Then create an array of those. 
Mych lower power consumption?
Thanks man =)
As far as I remember, Python only enforces the same level in the same block of indentation to be consistent. Examples: Valid: def f(x): &lt;tb&gt;x +=1 &lt;tb&gt;return x Valid: def f(x): &lt;tb&gt;x +=1 Valid: def f(x): &lt;tb&gt;x +=1 &lt;tb&gt;if x == 5 &lt;tb&gt;&lt;sp&gt;return x Invalid: def f(x): &lt;tb&gt;x +=1 &lt;sp&gt;return x
A list of tuples or a list of dicts should be fine. To make the code better to use I'd recommend namedtuples: In [1]: from collections import namedtuple In [2]: Person = namedtuple('Person', 'name age city') In [3]: names = 'Alice Bob Charlie'.split() In [4]: ages = 23, 43, 32 In [5]: cities = 'New York,Boston,Philadelphia'.split(',') In [6]: people = [Person(name, age, city) for name, age, city in zip(names, ages, cities)] In [7]: for person in people: ...: print('{p.name} is {p.age} years old and lives in {p.city}.'.format(p=person)) ...: Alice is 23 years old and lives in New York. Bob is 43 years old and lives in Boston. Charlie is 32 years old and lives in Philadelphia. In [8]: p = people[0] In [9]: p Out[9]: Person(name='Alice', age=23, city='New York') In [10]: p.name Out[10]: 'Alice' In [11]: p.age Out[11]: 23 In [12]: p.city Out[12]: 'New York' In [13]: p[0] Out[13]: 'Alice' In [14]: p[1] Out[14]: 23 In [15]: p[2] Out[15]: 'New York' 
'boss, he uses tabs instead of spaces. Pls stop him'
I believe it's more like "80 characters or 100 characters if you can agree on it".
Don't give up so easily - you finally (after 4 hours) decide to make a post here and then give up completely 5 minutes later... Secondly, if you actually want someone to be able to help you get it working then you need to include a lot more information in your post. For example: the outputs of the pip install commands, the full error message that comes up when the module is not found, and a copy of the code that causes this error. Thirdly, I have never had any significant trouble with Python3 on Windows when I install all dependencies into project-specific virtual environments. Python is a great cross-platform language! Finally, https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython - pretty sure they have some good links in the sidebar related to getting Python to work on Windows without issue. 
Thanks for the reply man. What I realised just now is that I can use the dict itself where the user can be key and pass can be value. But thanks for your input. 
I'd go with celery. Here's why: celery looks complicated, but really isn't that much. Our of the box it works, it integrates pretty well with most DB code and tends to just work. There's a learning curve, but basically, here's the success recipe: use Redis as result backend, use RabbitMQ as broker. More queues is better. 
Okay, I didn't know, cheers 
I spent 5 hours on it which is more than most would attempt. I have gone through every stack overflow link in existence related to my question. Don't jump to conclusions, my frustration is understandable seeing as plenty of others have troubles installing using pip with Windows systems.
Could you elaborate at all? I've found it to be a smooth transition.
Working on a API security testing assignment. Complicated part is that all the requests need the payload signed with the private key. The signature is sent as a http header. This made the testing very complicated as using BurpSuite out of the box couldn't work. There wasn't any extension available either and I didnt have "time" to write an extension either. So wrote the entire thing in Python. Basically before a request is sent, the payload is signed and then the request is sent. The request is sent via the burp proxy so I can look at the requests afterwards. Improvised it by generating malicious payloads for the json payload and signing those as well. Took me a while but this is probably only the second time that I have used Python in my work related assignments. 
Hi, Zerynth offers the benefits of microprocessor-based boards like Raspberry Pi: - Python language (or hybrid C/Python if necessary) - Multithreading support (Zerynth is based on a RTOS) - easy to use along with the great advantages of microcontroller-based boards: - lower power consumption - lower hardware costs in the prototyping phase - extremely lower hardware costs in the industrialization phase 
Contact the site owner or use the official API.
Hi, Zerynth is a based on a Python Virtual Machine that runs on top of a real-time OS (RTOS), allowing development in Python but also in C if real-time is needed. In particular: * Zerynth has a small footprint, only 60k-80k of flash, 3-5k RAM. Such footprint is achieved by writing the VM from scratch and choosing to remove the compiler and the REPL from the microcontroller. * Zerynth features a RTOS for multithreading. In Zerynth each Python thread is a RTOS thread managed by a priority aware realtime scheduler. Moreover, in Zerynth, RTOS threads written in C can live along the VM allowing for a mixed C/Python real-time environment. * Zerynth supports C-Python programming. Existing C code (or C object code) can be easily mixed with Python scripts without VM recompilation. Note that Zerynth and Micropython are two completely separate projects. Besides the technical differences mentioned above, Zerynth and Micropython have also a different target audience: * MicroPython is a very good and orthodox implementation of Python for microcontrollers, ideal for education and prototyping. * Zerynth offers a complete ecosystem that allows developing commercial embedded and IoT applications using Python. Ideal for prototyping and also for production. For a more detailed comparison take a look here: [Micropython vs Zerynth](https://community.zerynth.com/discussion/382/zerynth-vs-micropython) 
This is the standard object oriented solution, and is what you would learn to do in the majority of Computer Science courses. * easily extensible * it's a simple list, which means there are no mental hurdles that must be overcome by others working on the code (or yourself after a few months) * the class can be re-used throughout your code base vs. passing around generic dict or tuples * can colsolidate your unit tests by separating your data logic (class) from your storage mechanism (list) * If you later decide that you need faster looking then a list, you can still easily switch to a dict of classes The fact that this is the lowest voted answer in this thread worries me about the state or r/python . Using classes instead of a generic dict or tuple for everything is just good practice and has many benefits.
Oh, in that case, this book is a really good resource. Skim through the chapter and see if it doesn't solve your problem.
Sure. I realise calling it injection is a bit of a misnomer. What I actually do is instrument the program by adding a simple loader that executes before the program itself, this loader then loads python into the process using `dlopen` and loads a shared library containing all your python code, this shared library also contains a static dump of program state that you want to load into the python interpreter. It's an instrumentation framework similar to [Frida](https://www.frida.re/) but mine is static and it uses Python at runtime.
Using plain old data structures to hold plain old data is just good practice and has many benefits. Classes without methods are an anti-pattern. 
&gt; Sorry if this is noob question Asking about the right tool for the job is never a noob question, don't be ashamed!
Can you open the same projects between PyCharm and WebStorm with no issues? I'm using a lot of Python and Javascript and was considering just downloading IntelliJ, but I don't really use Java. I'm guessing I should just roll with PyCharm and WebStorm instead of just IntelliJ?
You are trying to set up a correspondence between card value and card name and translate back and forth. There is nothing wrong with that, but I would suggest an alternative: create a list of cards, each of which has a value and name, and use random.choice or random.sample to pick your hand: from collections import namedtuple from random import sample Card = namedtuple("Card", ("value", "name")) deck = ( Card(2, "2"), Card(3, "3"), # ... Card(11, "Jack"), Card(12, "Queen"), Card(13, "King"), Card(14, "Ace") ) hand = sample(deck, 3) # pick three cards without replacement high_card = max(hand, key = lambda card: card.value) print("Your highest card is a", high_card.name, "which has a value of", high_card.value)
If I were given a `user` object that simply had `username` and `password` as members, I wouldn't actually know about those members without exploring the class definition. On the other hand, if I were given a tuple called `username_password`, I am already familiar with how to access the first and second values of a tuple, and I know from the name that username is the first value, and password is the second value. Why make me go look at the API of a brand new class when you can use an existing API that I am already familiar with and serves the exact same purpose?
&gt; Basically it has to loop with a timer. That's correct... or you use the tools of your OS to do so, like a cron job.
I've been watching an youtuber named Corey Shafer, he teaches python there. Maybe you could check out the topics he covers (he has a lot of videos, too much to write here). Or maybe try the order that the python tutorial at python.org used.
I'd go with cron, but you might want to look at the [https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html](sched module).
 I think A byte of python is suitable for beginners.
Is it possible to put import time time.sleep(30) %30 seconds And then put a loop around the whole code? Loop it like 10 times if I want it send 10 times for example. 
Is it possible to put import time time.sleep(30) %30 seconds And then put a loop around the whole code? Loop it like 10 times if I want it send 10 times for example. 
Why don't you just give it a try?
Instead of using `random.randint` to generate a list index, you should use `random.choice` to directly take a sample from it.
Yes.
Is it in a loop? If it is put a sleep time on it so you don't sent hundreds of requests a minute.

Strange, in my original code I would get the following error after running line ftp.storlines('STOR '+ filename, myfile) =&gt;ftplib.error_perm: 552 Exceeded storage allocation (for current directory or dataset). My understanding is that this error occurs when I exceed the data transfer cap. However the file did get placed. I thought it worked but the code stops after this error, so the loop just breaks. Any ideas?

Should just follow /r/rust's example and set up /r/pythonjerk.
You could wrap it in a try / except block, so that it would continue anyway, or increase the time interval.
It's for concurrent operations, not exactly what OP wanted.
Did you close all files and connections?

I was also disappointed by their unwillingness to integrate my patches about virtualenv/conda. Things would be much more easier for pythonists if we can, for instance, put everything in a warehouse and deploy it in the cluster
Supposedly you dont need to write the full path to pip. If it doesn't worl otherwise, there's probably something wrong with your environment variables. Usually you'd just need to type "pip install package". Maybe you have python2.7 installed as well and you're invoking it by mistake You can also try to use Anaconda. It comes with a lot of packages pre included and usually works straight out of the box. 
I like the show but the community is aweful. I was fearing that this shit was gonna spread on programming subs...
What's your end goal with this? This sounds extremely inefficient.
Again, Id like to operate on this array the fastest way possible :)
That's not your end goal. I feel like you have an [XY problem](http://xyproblem.info/).
Most big sites rate limit and often there is a robots.txt endpoint on their top URL which tells you their rules/expectations for scraping. You can often put a sleep of a few seconds into your code between requests and your scraper will be fine. But your mileage may vary depending upon what you are scraping.
Yes.
I'm polish, but I tried to pronounce it just as you said so I guess it would be similar in Russian :)
Ack, incremental backoff should be used in this situation anyway.
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3717715 A discussion about a post titled "stop using classes"
No, the code isn't clean, and if there are more parameters, you are ending up with a lot of function calls, while you could instead just pass a dict, which could have been loaded from a config file, for example. In this technique you need to slice the config and make a function call for each parameter separately. Another thing I don't like is that this syntax somehow suggest that the order of calls matters, which is often not so.
A poor craftsman always blames his tools.
Why would you copy paste the same comment and post it to two different people? What's the point?
So that they get a notification as well.
I downloaded anaconda to download scrappy and now all of my pip installs will not work. Why do you think this is the case? 
I would use Cron. Otherwise you need to make sure your program can't ever die, or you would have to have it running under some sort of service monitor. Cron is the easiest and is very reliable. You just need to put something in the script to make sure you don't have multiple instances running at once (for example if the network makes the transfer hang). For that you can use flock(2) or write a short wrapper script in bash and use flock(1)
&gt;how is this implementation better suited for "time critical applications"? I already answered this question. When I say "time critical" I don't necessarily mean "as fast as possible". Microcontrollers/RTOS's can have deterministic timing, and almost all of what people are running on a raspberry pi isn't an RTOS. If you need a sensor read every X.X microseconds, or a motor feedback loop recalculated every X.X microseconds, you need deterministic timing. It's that simple. It's true that C/C++ is usually better suited to these embedded kinds of tasks, but that doesn't mean that a higher-level language doesn't have its niche. IMO, Python's strength lies in it's ability to rapidly prototype so, if you're working on an embedded application and you want to try/iterate something fast, Python could very well be the best way to do that. That being said, I've never taken that route because I've never programmed something embedded that benefited from a higher-level language much. But if I ever embed an online machine learning algorithm in an embedded device, I can see where Python might be useful.
Excuse me, just stared programming 2 days ago. With try/except can I program IF Error 552 occurs execute something else? 
Except I use java and R just fine, Python is the only one who doesnt understand how to provide their language to windows users effectively.
 s = select([users, addresses]).where(users.c.id == addresses.c.user_id) for row in conn.execute(s): print(row) (1, u'jack', u'Jack Jones', 1, 1, u'jack@yahoo.com') (1, u'jack', u'Jack Jones', 2, 1, u'jack@msn.com') (2, u'wendy', u'Wendy Williams', 3, 2, u'www@www.org') (2, u'wendy', u'Wendy Williams', 4, 2, u'wendy@aol.com' From: http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/tutorial.html#selecting
For every element in a sequence, do something. "For every prime number between 1 and 5, calculate the sum of its digits and print it.", etc. Also, this is a question for /r/learnpython.
let try this, but keep in mind r/learnpython would be a better place for this question. basket = ['apple', 'orange', 'banana'] print("here is the list of my fruits") for fruit in basket: print(fruit) mean in english print the name of each fruit in my basket, or for each fruit in basket print the fruit. keep in mind that is the way for works for python as it is not true for every language. (it is always some kind of loop, but not in this exact same way).
Basically you take a piece of a list of items and then do something with that piece. # I have a jar of cookies. jar_of_cookies = ["chocolate chip", "toffee crunch", "oatmeal raisins"] # 'For every cookie in the cookie jar' for cookie in jar_of_cookies: print(cookie) # All of the cookies in the cookie jar will be printed. The line `for cookie in jar_of_cookies` should be pretty readable for anyone. Just be aware that having a good name for the iterated element (in this case `cookie`) is crucial so that you and other readers of your code wouldn't be confused on what your loop does. Hope this helps! Sidenote: I can personally attest to the fact that `for` loops in Python doesn't come intuitive when you came from other languages. If that is the case, then its better to think that there are no `for` loops in Python, only `for each` loops. 
I understand now. Thank you!

/r/learnpython may be of more help (and *is* the appropriate place for these questions)
Good suggestions. Also try Cloud9: [c9.io](https://c9.io/)
One way to do it: get rid of your for loops. - Select all elements i,t where certainarray[i] != certainarray[t] - Calculate cos(certainarray[t]) for those elements - Accumulate them into certainresult (einsum or numexpr will be fastest) - If that's not fast enough, port it to the GPU Another way to do it: keep your for loops - Try numba.jit, or run with PyPy - If that's not fast enough, port to Cython. Julia is an option, too A third way to do it: find a math framework that can do it for you. Probably Theano, maybe SymPy. I haven't used them myself, so I can't tell. By the way. an array 50000 is *small*. Once you optimize, it's easy to go another order of magnitude larger (or two). 
It's not a brute force search - it has an index.
What text editor have you used doesn’t have a default value for tab with? It asks you each time you open it “how wide should a tab be!?” No. 
Given your constraints, yes you can figure out the angle between the central axis of the camera and either of the two points, because you can trivially draw a right angle linking the two and solve for A. Absent further constraints, the simple answer to the second question is no. For a single, non-moving camera (aka no parallax information), any point visible within its frustrum can be at any depth along a ray drawn through the nodal point of the lens to that point. Now, assuming you know the focal length of the lens, if you also know the size of the object, or its spatial relationship to the other two points, then you've got more to go off of, but strictly from what you've described, if I've read it all correctly, no.
&gt; I can't find an example in English. This is an especially *mathy* way to talk about the idea of "perform an operation on each element of a set", i.e. "for each element e in set S and function F, give back F(e)." You're more likely to read or hear this syntax in a logic class, or if you've taken discrete math, or other kinds of advanced algebra. Also programmers will just, you know, talk like this. In some other languages the "for" loop is called "for-each", further clarifying that it's about applying some kind of operation to each element of a set or structure that you can traverse over (an *iterable.*) But the "each" is really kind of redundant, so it doesn't appear in languages that are strongly C-flavored or are built on C (like Python is.)
With gyro and accelerometer and ML should be possible, albeit imperfect 
just wing it. do you know your shit? and actually no, don't waste your time compiling resources and shit. just tell them a website or tut to go to.
I can agree with that, and considering the specific context of the question, I would agree that a tuple is sufficient too. I come from a .NET background, so taking a more OO approach is natural. But yeah, maybe and over kill if it’s not reused or extended - it was just a suggestion. 
It's an inverted index. [This](http://www.solrtutorial.com/basic-solr-concepts.html) might help you, it's for solr, but Lucene the search technology behind it is the same.
&gt; And I want to store username and password in a data structure and loop from it. What should I use? If your usernames are unique, use a dict. You can iterate over the keys and values easily in Python using tuple expansion and the ```.items()``` method on dict: for username, password in userpass.items(): browser.find_element_by_id("txtlogin").send_keys(username) browser.find_element_by_id("txtPassword").send_keys(password) 
&gt; (You have to be consistent in Python 3) You have to be consistent within a block, but block by block you can mix tabs and spaces freely, although don't do that on code anyone else has to deal with, because their editor will probably eat it.
That's exactly what I did. Now my program runs perfectly ;)
GitHub repo: https://github.com/pyscripter/pyscripter
I thought you meant using the standard "tab inserts spaces" text editor option you'd insert 7 spaces. As long as you didn't mean that then I won't try to convince you spaces are superior unless you're applying to be my coworker. 
It can be either convex or concave
Two (unhelpful) things: 1. This really belongs in /r/learnpython 2. If you indent with four spaces, your code will format: Your code: Certainresult=np.zeros(len(certainarray)) for i in range(len(certainarray)): for t in range(len(certainarray)): if certainarray[i]!=certainarray[t]: Certainresult[i]+=cos(certainarray[t]) 
Hi, I like this week’s episode! Now that JOSS was mentioned during the conversation, I think it would be nice to have an episode with one of the JOSS/JORS editors. I think that a lot of submissions in this journal are Python projects :D 
Check out how golang does it. Imo it’s the best. Tabs for initial indent, spaces for sub alignment
Comprehensive walk of python async programming (long but worth it): http://pgbovine.net/python-async-io-walkthrough.htm
Could not install it on mac due pynotify. Collecting pyinotify (from brightml) Using cached pyinotify-0.9.6.tar.gz Complete output from command python setup.py egg_info: inotify is not available on macosx-10.12-x86_64 
I rewrote that part so inotify is not neccessary anymore, but still it won't work on OSX unfortunately. That'll be a big release though!
I am looking for something long, so no worries there. Thanks. :D
Naive question maybe, but why do you want to scrape LinkedIn?
It looks to me that you're trying to do a convolution? As in `numpy.conv`? Probably spend some more time on the math side of things before you try and optimize your program. 
Not sure why you got a downvote, it's the correct answer.
What kind of tasks do you solve with Python? Front end work, back end? When I'm stuck searching for milestones to cross, it sometimes helps for me to define some clear, measurable goals (and maybe a couple of nebulous ones thrown in) - then start to line them up and work through them. 
Ya can't son. Ya stuck foreva. Or: Time and practice. 
Also, do it in order: for i in range(1,5): print(i) &gt; 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 &gt; 4 &gt; 5

Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython. We **highly encourage** you to re-submit your post over on there. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community is actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers. If you have a question to do with homework or an assignment of any kind, please make sure to read their sidebar rules **before** submitting your post. If you have any questions or doubts, feel free to reply or send a modmail to us with your concerns. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
Build an async Web backend that performs some sort of machine learning using tensorflow, store results in some database, and have it serve jinja 2 Web content to users for input and output. Then rewrite it after you get feedback, and add a qt5 desktop client. Now you pro bro.
Working on predict solver on steroids. 
The dumb approach would be to store the value, apply the transform to the whole array, then replace the unchanged value. Certainly faster than looping.
I would advise watching raymond hettinger's talks, he has a thing about explaining python concepts and practices. http://pyvideo.org/speaker/raymond-hettinger.html
Experience helps, but ability is also necessary. You'll get much more of a kick from ancillary programmer skills (software design, testing, project management, etc.), supporting knowledge (whether crypto, statistics, your favourite field of application), or background knowledge of the software ecosystem so as to not end up reinventing the wheel or a poor solution. There are programmers who can grind out code, and there are some who can actually write relevant, well-thought code. Just being familiar with Pandas or library X doesn't mean you're a good programmer.
Whilst I suspect you're joking, anybody who spits out something like that competently done would be, at least in my mind, expert enough. Just instead of tensorflow, use mxnet so that you don't have super easy examples to copy paste and have to dig into the documentation properly. 
Scrapy is not the tool for this kind of thing… or at least not directly. Sure, it can change the user agent string, or you can deploy it on some remote server with a different IP or other identifying characteristics, but that's not the purpose of scrapy *per se*. Also, use `requests` directly.
SRSLY man. Don't do this. First off, wrong level of abstraction. Two, not flexible. Three, there are easier ways of doing this… with a proper DBAPI library. Either use the MySQL libraries for Python directly, or an ORM like SQLAlchemy. Four, you're the classic example of SQL injection potential. Finally, for heaven's sake, please stop using Python 2 format strings. They've been deprecated ages ago. There are better ways of formatting things from Python 3 to 3.6.
- [Wiki article on database programming](https://wiki.python.org/moin/DatabaseProgramming) - [SQLAlchemy page listing supported MySQL libraries](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/dialects/mysql.html)
Sounds like solid noob-targeted advice.
Please use /r/learnpython next time.
Thx. Will do!
Trying to start an website, but always scared away by the way to deploy it to shared host server. Hopes one day it can be as easy as to deploy a PHP site. 
Also, rule of thumb, never shell out. Call a process using the proper `execve`-based functions, or use the higher level `subprocess` API. I'll let you look into that yourself… or read an operating systems textbook for the whole shebang. That's another security nightmare, reviewing peoples' shelling out code, because most people don't really know how to write proper and safe shell code. Ask yourself if you actually understand what you're outputting, and how the shell will parse it. &gt; What happens if… oh! I just broke it.
Probably vote fuzzing
Interesting!
Are there any good books on generators and asynchronous functions in general in python particularly Asyncio and the entire event loop concept?
I first read that as "bright html", then as "brig html"...
The algorithm you have written down is quadratic in N = len(certainarray). However this problem is much easier if the array is sorted since equal values have to be adjacent. Hence there is an N lg(N) version that works by sorting the array first, doing the calculations and then mapping the results back into the original order. Something like: import numpy as np from itertools import groupby sortedarray = sorted(certainarray) indices = np.argsort(np.argsort(certainarray)) # sortedarray[indices[i]] == certainarray[i] so we can map back at the end. sum_cos = sum(cos(item) for item in sortedarray) blocks = [(k, len(list(g))) for k, g in groupby(sortedarray)] repetitions = [(k, m) for k, m in blocks for _ in range(m)] sortedresults = [sum_cos - m * cos(k) for k, m in repetitions] certainresults = [sortedresults[index] for index in indices] 
I mostly know what I'm doing (not really, but I've gotten decent at Google). But I really like this idea and would have loved to have something like this as a kid. So I got it anyway, and will give it to someone at work, or someone from work's kid. Wish I'd have seen it when it was still a kickstarter, but glad you made it!
if someone's built an app on Flask and knows about design patterns then I'm sure they can figure out Dash.
Agreed, I think I'm going to give this one a shot. It's got a little bit of everything.
Thanks for the positive feedback, and we appreciate you sharing it :-)

Stupid question but are you activating your virtual environment before the pip install? Can you print out sys.path aka your PYTHONPATh from inside your virtual env?
Exception based and 'ask for forgiveness' code design! Pretty boring, but a lot of peeps get this wrong.
I am 100% sourcing the virtualenv beforehand. I can print the path inside, and... it looks right to me. In [2]: sys.path Out[2]: ['/root/eddietest/someenv/lib/python2.7/site-packages', '', '/opt/company/bin', '/opt/company/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pip-8.1.2-py2.7.egg', '/opt/company', '/opt/company/lib/python27.zip', '/opt/company/lib/python2.7', ...]
&gt; What knowledge should I seek next after all the basic stuff? My own experience sort of went along these milestones, on two axes: In terms of Python *programming*: 1) I know how to write *functions* to solve problems reusably. 2) I know how to write *modules* to solve problems reusably. 3) I know how to write *classes* to solve problems reusably. 4) I know how to write *frameworks* to solve problems reusably. and then in terms of Python *distribution*: 1) I know how to release *a single Python file* for users to run. 2) I know how to release *a git repository* for users to run. 3) I know how to release a git repository for users to *install with pip.* 4) I know how to release a *pip package* for users to install from PyPI. I don't actually know how to do that last one, yet, which is why I wouldn't call myself an expert. But I would suggest trying to locate yourself on these axes, and then that should point you at some broad categories of study to work on.
Hi i am trying to learn python myself have u come by any guides or tips and tricks or are u following a program about it. Out of intrest:D
Snakes and ladders, as a school project. I have a post on this, I've completed the code I just need to create the UI. 
This is trivial learn to use Google. Take the size of one photo. Multiply by number of total photos. Done. Convert to unit of choice. Without knowing the size or datatype of the images it is impossible to answer this for you. 
Contribute to open source projects, this worked for me very well, by doing you will gain: 1) Experience, since your PRs will be review by expert programmers 2) During interview you will have something to show and impress HR and other engineers 3) Karma, for your contributions 4) Study algorithms they teach how to think 5) write code almost every day This worked for me, I started as not very experienced, but willing to do any work for open source projects. Open source people taught me good engineering practices, how to write clean maintainable code, importance of simple things like linter, tests, coverage etc.
Can you give examples of some of the functions you're expected to write 
Thanks, is there a way to place 2 different images with a transparent background over another image based on a set if conditions, e.G. put a red dot over, say, square 14 and a blue dot over 21? 
Haha, yea, tbh I saw it one time like that and was afraid people might see it like that. Since then I'm really only reading bright ml , but this is a downside of the naming for sure :/
Fuzzing doesn't go to 0 or -1 I think
It seems Darth Vader is proficient in Python as well as the ways of the Sith. You just know Vader codes his own suit.
Yes, of course. 
This entire blog is inspiring and beautiful. 
Or possibly misclick. I sometimes accidentally vote when I try to scroll on my phone.
1: read the sidebar 2: post to the right subreddit 3: read the sidebar in *that* sub If you can't so much as read a sidebar, I don't see life as a coder working out for you.
I've been working with Python for a few years but I haven't done much in the way of game design so this still looks pretty interesting to me. I might just give it a go.
Sure thing I followed the jetbrains tutorial for python it's built into the ide they have. They have a free student edition the last time I checked it's pretty nice, you could also try https://learnpythonthehardway.org It's pretty cool, I had a hard time with it but others have said they like it. https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python Is also a good start. Uhm you could check Coursera but I haven't been there in a while but they should have something for free. As for tips Don't be afraid to ask questions r/pythonhelp is pretty nice, haven't had any jerks there. Make sure after you complete the tutorial keep doing projects to keep it fresh and to challenge yourself. http://www.practicepython.org It's what I use so far, let me know if you need any help with it :)

Fluent Python covers this very well. It talks about generators and builds on that to explain all the new async syntax and asyncio. It's very in depth and easy to follow ;)
The fluent python book?
