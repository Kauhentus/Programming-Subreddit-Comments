There are a lot of beginner projects at [Kharagpur Winter of Code](https://kwoc.kossiitkgp.in/projects). Open Source is probably a better way to do projects than doing alone (although both helps very much).
Like this? https://github.com/skywind3000/terminal Also 5 secs on google turns up some alternatives on pypi.
Put the script in a filesystem location that is not accessible to the user. If the script needs to run as the same user who must be prevented from running it interactively, I'm not sure what to tell you. But if it just needs to be non-root, create a service user that does have permission to read that filesystem location.
Feels ironic that I was just thinking a tool almost exactly like this. Only question the github readme doesn't address is the need for windows support. 80% of my work is in linux but lately that 20% has been on Windows and it is consuming 80% of my dev time.
Of course! The service already runs as it’s own service user. I’ll just have to adjust the file permissions on the script and I’m all set (except for when running as root). Thanks!
Then find a better locking strategy, like opening and holding on to a file descriptor (instead of just existence of the lock file) or a named socket as those are released by the OS when the process terminates. There are a whole bunch of those on pypi.
&gt;ctrl+P and ctrl+N autocomplete work great for me. Also require additional setup/configuration. Which takes more time an effort than a solid IDE to setup/maintain. &gt;With Python I have very little trouble remembering the names of all the functions/methods that I need to use, and if I do need a reminder then I just google "python &lt;module&gt; thing that I need to do but maybe can't remember". So which is it? You don't need google or you do? I am saying than most people need some help some of the time because we have human level memory. You clearly agree. Also what about modules that are not core python? 3rd party libs and functions I write myself do make up a significant amount of my function calls. Plus isn't going to google breaking the flow of development, especially compared to code completion? &gt; Or use help(&lt;thing&gt;) In the ideal world where every thing I wish to call help on, has a properly defined help section. Again 3rd party functions and internal methods don't always have the same level of docs as core packages. Thankfully debuggers exist =D &gt;I'll grant that both of those are a bit slower than PyCharm (et. al) autocomplete, but as I think has already been established this thread - typing speed is not the hard problem when it comes to software development. Less featureful, and more effort to setup than pycharm is the point. vim doesn't handle things like django templates very well which can require syntax highlighting for at least 4 languages in a single template file. Pycharm not only does highlighting correctly, it does code completion correctly. &gt;Navigating and interacting with the codebase is vastly more time consuming, and understanding how the pieces fit together is much more important. While PyCharm is often better at navigation than Vim, because it parses the code and can use some context at figuring things out, it usually gets in my way more than it gets out of my way. Sounds like a PEBKAC issue to me. &gt;I probably know and use more PyCharm (and other) shortcuts than the average user of those tools, and yet I still find more friction in the process with PyCharm (and others) than I do with Vim. So stop fighting it? &gt;As a complete aside, when I was coding in .NET I found VS to be much more helpful - but that's largely because the .NET apis didn't really fit my head, and documentation is garbage compared to Python. But I also had CTRL+\, CTRL+V bound to launch Vim at the current line and column of the current file, because when I was refactoring code I'm much faster with Vim. Sounds like a mental block. &gt;Here are some of the things that my OS is responsible for: - running programs (like git, for instance, or testing applications) - launching programs (like a webserver, for instance) - launching shells So everything vim and emacs do with plugins or sometimes with just built in features? &gt;Those are all things that IDEs re-build on top of the OS. Huh? you need to explain that, not just claim it. Stringing a few common functions used in software development together in a gui does not make an OS. &gt;The argument I've always thought of for doing that is that it's great and if you learn your IDE then you know how to do it everywhere you can install your IDE. So vim is only as good on the platforms you can install it also, that's a non argument. Especially given how many platforms the JVM operates on, that Python also operates on. &gt;But then I asked myself how is that different, better, and an improvement than simply learning how to do it at the OS level? You mean using syscalls to open a file? I shouldn't have to explain why that's inferior for average use case. The abstractions exist for this reason. Start from the position of "these abstractions exist, so they must provide value for _some reason_ so what are the reasons?" You might gain new insight on a subject. &gt;And I've never been able to give myself a satisfactory answer. Do you have one? You ever try to write your own shell? It sucks. That's why we stand on the shoulders of giants and work with abstractions until they fail and we need new/better tools. IDE is the new better tool over a plain text editor or even a text editor with 100+ plugins. the "integrated" part of IDE is what is so important, that isn't replicated in previous generation text editors. 
No, definitely not. You can also use `@property` if you do need a getter/setter.
Writing some function caching decorator is an early Python rite of passage. Understanding why you probably shouldn't comes a lot later.
Ya that’s what I meant. Sorry should’ve been more concise. Using @property and @x.setter
&gt; Only question the github readme doesn't address is the need for windows support. There are some comments in the repo that some interpreter versions won't work on Windows, maybe that means there is a windows version? Maybe installable via pypi? &gt; 80% of my work is in linux but lately that 20% has been on Windows and it is consuming 80% of my dev time. Feel your pain. But you can also use docker on windows ;)
So your colleague writes `@property` getters/setters that just update a private value somewhere? There's absolutely no reason to do that.
does it come with the IO monad?
I worked as a LAMP developer. One day my manager came to me and asked me to write some automation scripts that would take NACHA bank files and tally the credits/debits, then generate a new NACHA file with the processed charges. He told me that I had to use Python because our PHP setup couldn't download the files using the FTP settings that our bank required (or something). I wound up using Python for 3 or 4 automation projects at that company, and use it for all my little programming projects. I've moved on to a network admin role at a new company, but my goal is to get a full-time Python dev position in the near future. 
QED
Brilliant, thank you. Now I will attempt to understand the code and learn from it!
I think port 9999 is not open.. I try configuring that port for network Comm. And hopefully that should fix the issue.. I was able to curl get the URL from another putty session to the same server.. So flask app works as expected only the port needs to be opened... 
Tell your coworker to stop using Java coding patterns in Python. 
Fortunately nothing to do with Haskell)
&gt; Unfortunately nothing to do with Haskell FTFY ;) 
Ya I thought I was crazy....
You are doing the right thing by reaching out but don't blame your prof. Nothing comes from it. Just push yourself to learn outside of class. 
I manage a Bungie.net Clan for Destiny/Destiny 2, and we use Discord to keep in touch/plan in-game activities and disseminate information related to the game. About a year ago, I decided I would try my hand at building a bot to pull JSON data from Bungie’s API, decode it using a local SQLite Manifest, and then have the bot post the results to our Discord. Since there were a fair number of items/activities that changed on a weekly basis, this experiment turned out to be well-loved convenience. Sadly, right as I was feeling confident about the bot’s capabilities, I realized the time I spent perfecting my code would be useless going into Destiny 2 since Bungie re-vamped their API structure for the sequel. So I figured, if I am going to have to re-create my project for Destiny 2, why not go bigger than before? Fast forward 2 months to the current day, and now my Weekly Reset bot has morphed into a stat collector for every clan member. I use SQLalchemy to write stats on every activity a clan member engages in into an SQLite database. At this point I’ve created 5 custom Discord commands - one to display information on a player’s last 5 PvP matches, one to use as an experience verification tool, one that gives a high-level overview of a player’s in-game progress, one to generate and post an infographic on any piece of armor or weaponry in the game, and lastly, one that analyzes someone’s entire PvP history to show their performance on every map, separated out by the different game modes in PvP. As an aside, that last command is getting re-worked to use Plotly and generate a Bar Graph for that information instead of reading text from a seemingly endless post. After a year+ of using Python, I discovered how much I love coding and will probably pursue a career in development once I’m a little more confident in my abilities.
Just curious, how is this different from selenium-requests? 
You can create a new script, then open it by executing "open": import sys import subprocess import tempfile def run_py_in_terminal(py_file): f = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False) f.write('#!/bin/bash\n') f.write(sys.executable + ' ' + py_file + '\n') f.close() return subprocess.Popen(['open', '-a', 'Terminal.app', f.name]) 
&gt; Feel your pain. But you can also use docker on windows ;) God I wish I could but there are MS environment specific requirements, it was a small miracle to use Python over C# (nothing wrong with that, I do like the language but not its ecosystem). If pyenv doesn't work with MS, there maybe a similar tool and now that I know what to look for it will be much easier to find. Barring that I can already see a way to write a brutal hack to accomplish similar behavior.
Java bleed over for sure, tell him you're gonna spend the next week writing a custom sorting function, he'll probably buy it.
that's nice but unless otherwise specified i assume people are using cython
I automated couple tasks and then created a blog using python where i post those projects. Helps me a lot to build a portfolio.
&gt; Does anyone know how to do this with ipv6 addresses. for ipv4 im using socket.getfqdn(address) which works fine. It works fine for me. Maybe there is no PTR record for the IPv6 address you are trying to look up.
My first experience with Python was an intro to computer programming course that touched on the basics before we really dove into learning programming with C. It really helped me learn the basics, but I didn't appreciate what Python was about at the time. Fast forward two years to an internship I had in industry that required Python development. Previously, I had considered myself a Java developer. When I learned about the intricacies of Python, I began to appreciate how powerful the language is.
&gt; Is it a common practice/requirement to write setter and getter using @property and @x.setter for every class public attributes? Absolutely not. A big point of these features is that you can transparently swap them in *if you ever need to*, so you don't have to "defensively" have a ton of trivial getters/setters just in case.
filter out the outliers (noise) if you know that it is way out of your signal range. maybe use the iqr and filter out values outside of that range. [how-do-you-find-the-iqr-in-numpy](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23228244/how-do-you-find-the-iqr-in-numpy) 
In 2002 I worked for a hospital and they needed a website to display doctor credentials. Well, they didn't need one, more like their process could be improved by one. So, I looked at frameworks at the time and Zope was pretty popular. I had a basic understanding of python, but Zope got me well acquainted with it. Now I'm working in devops and writing Python scripts 90% of the time. 
I'm working on a project that downloads *movies/TV series* from [fmovies/bmovies!](https://bmovies.is/). I have figured out most of the things, the only thing that I could not is how are the tokens being generated and a parameter that fetches the video url. Here is the project: [github!](https://github.com/vaulstein/fmovies). I would be grateful if anyone could help. 
I saw this comment: &gt; pyenv works excellent under windows subsystem for linux, but You need windows10anniversary edition or newer.^[1](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer/issues/47) Maybe a small silver lining for you. But win10 anniversery subsystem sounds way too specific :(
This is awesome. Great work! I would love to be a contributor.
You need to learn the difference between a class and a function.
Getting modules on PyPI isn’t very easy. There are a lot of gotchas and edge cases. As such, I find it amazing that a developer could figure that all out but not how to use git. If you do not use version control, even for single-developer situations, you are doing yourself a huge disservice. It can seem a bit daunting at first, but it gets (much) easier. 
It’s been a one man show for me so far. Feel free to browse the repo and docs and look for anything you’d like to contribute. If you shoot me with a dm of an email I can invite you to my slack channel as well. 
A dictionary! Being an ass aside (sorry, it was too easy), there are tons of tutorials. What type of coding are you doing? Scientific? Check out scipy lectures. Otherwise, Python 101 is pretty good and available online (the author is. Redditor)
I would like to have classes with various functions within them. Whether that is the correct way to accomplish what I want to accomplish, I don't know. I would guess not given the down vote and your response.
Good luck with that. Clearly congress doesn't listen to voters, so maybe you will have better luck with bots.
I mean I figured if they can use robocalls and spam people with email and snail mail, why can't I do something similar?
The only reason you need these is if youre doing computation, like a dynamic value. Static attributes dont need getters/setters
Personally I made a chatbot for slack as my intro to python project. I learned so much from doing that project
I started when I was bored and 8 years old and found some blog post about it. I got serious about it when I was a sysadmin in an understaffed, underfunded section of the IT department at a Fortune 100. I am now a C#/.NET developer writing ERP software at a large, privately owned company. 
I'm not saying you should not be using classes or functions, I'm saying you need to learn the difference between them as you currently do not. You need to learn the difference between a class and a function before writing another line of code.
I don't know what you mean. Before I read what you wrote I would have responded with "I do know the difference" so the response essentially reads as "you need to know the difference between classes and functions that you don't currently know". I'm sure there are many differences and probably a lot wouldn't apply to what I'm trying to accomplish. Classes are things and functions do things but classes can have functions within them that do things, no? I want classes because I want each .exe to be a class. I want it to be a class because the function will change depending on what .exe is selected. I don't know if I'm going about it the right way but I'm just saying that I don't know what do to with the statement "You need to learn the difference between a class and a function".
I don't even know what that is but I can get it if necessary, after development everything just gets packed into a executable anyway. Thank you very much, I appreciate bringing this to my attention!
Whenever you learn a concept, try and find something fun you can do with that knowledge. Let's say you just learned MySQL,.and you know GUI, and webscraping. With your knowledge of them you can come up with a project that scraps data on the web, stores it in a database and displays it to a user. Start small, you can develop a calculator without a GUI interface and when you learn GUI, you could then develop a calculator with a GUI interface. 
thanks for the pointers! This is similar to what we're currently doing, but I had hopes the library would be able to help abstract some of the synchronization complexity for this use case. Do you know of any projects that had to solve a similar issue? It looks like a pretty basic pattern for a messaging system. Thanks!
Because that limitation seems arbitrary and extraneous without any context. Limiting users unnecessarily is difficult, not foolproof, and it's their system. So if that constraint is real, it probably needs to be accounted for by your program and behavior shouldn't be relied upon from the OS/init system. But the need for the constraint is not understood, hence many questions (still unanswered). 
Depends on what's reading the file, you can't make it inherently red. There are control sequences you can include that will make most *nix terminal emulators to switch to red when you dump the file to stdout (with `cat`, for example).
Relative beginner here, I use Python for engineering, data analysis, plotting, etc very similarly to projects that Matlab is suitable for. I wrote a fairly sophisticated (for me) engineering analytical application that reads from files, does some calculations, makes plots, and writes files. Currently, I just run this from the PyCharm debugger but would like to wrap it in a command line application. All of the tutorials that I can find on google are garbage and not sufficiently detailed for me to make sense of. Any recommendations? Note: All of my programming experience over the past ten years have been around algorithm writing for engineering applications but have no experience wrapping it into a standalone application. 
I started off in VB.Net in school but started getting pulled over to python cause of the libraries. Currently still a die hard python user even though there are speed benefits to other languages... I just love the simplicity and the libraries for it like all the machine learning ones.
I opted for this option (although all were very compelling options): subprocess.Popen(['open', '-a', 'Terminal.app', py_file]) Thanks!
To expand on /u/masklinn 's correct point: The @property toolkit is for "upgrading" normal attributes into getters and setters transparently. For example, you've got a class with a field Age ( let's say it's for checking expiration times on data ). You initially write the application such that Age is an arbitrary timedelta value. Later on, you realize that people are somehow setting an Age value that's negative. You can use @property to replace the "raw" Age datetime value with a setter function that validates the delta and makes sure it isn't pointing to a point in the future.
That is an abomination. Look up .split 
A simple text app like notepad 
Then no.
What text apps would allow for this? 
Just a warning though to never use homebrew encyption for any form of identifying material in a prod setting. You may think it's un-hackable or un-decryptable, but be humble and realize that there are much more intelligent and well staffed teams both building boxed solutions, and attacking your code. 
Note, I count the modules that *link to* their GitHub repo. All the others might as well use GitHub just have not included the link. Then again, I know a few developers who either don't use VCS or use a private VCS.
Definitely. Also https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/18197/why-shouldnt-we-roll-our-own
 class whateverclass(employee_information): os.startfile("C:\whatever.exe") time.sleep(2) pyautogui.typewrite(username) pyautogui.press('tab') pyautogui.typewrite(password) pyautogui.press('enter') This is not a class. Sure, you've marked it as a class but really it's just a block of code that will be run at import time.
r/learnpython is the place for you. There are plenty of guides and tutorials out there. Good luck!
If you're willing to check out another website, I always thought that DataQuest.io had a very good, easy-to-digest intro to Python, which should help you get up to speed quickly. The lessons are delivered as simple exercises (completed right in your browser), and I thought it did an excellent job breaking things down into very digestible bits and helping you get up to speed quickly. If you're absolutely set on getting a book, Al Sweigert's Automate the Boring Stuff is pretty good -- text is free online (https://automatetheboringstuff.com), but you can buy a physical book for a pretty reasonable price.
Webbrowsers that know html. Terminals which understands ascii escapes, PDF readers, or rich text editors like word or libreoffice
Do you mind me asking what it's like working in this area? I'm currently doing CS as a subject but doing machine learning courses and similar outside of classes, something I'm really interested in. Cheers :)
Not sure about books, I find it easier to learn from doing, hence why I found [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) so fantastic, free for almost all of the content aswell asides from a couple of assessed projects
MS kind of gave up and implented a [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) based on ubuntu. So you can finally go full *nix on win ;) But I don't know if you can use it for packing applications, haven't touched win in years.
I originally had it as a function but thought classes were more appropriate. I was wrong. Here is the current code which is definitely got me on the right track. https://pastebin.com/Y4gxmUJc

Hey, we actually dedicated a small section of our readme to selenium-requests cause we thought some people could find it useful. The main difference is that selenium-requests is selenium with the ability to make POSTs, GETs, PUTs, etc, using requests. And requestium is requests with an added selenium webdriver. We wanted requestium to be a drop in replacement for requests, while also having the ability to use selenium. Other than that, requestium adds some helper methods for xpath, css, re, managing cookies, waiting for elements and improving selenium clicking.
What protocol will the bot use to communicate? If it's a webAPI (slack, discord, facebook), you can always just spin up more instances/have enough power with async.
I wouldn't mind this, but you can use `for key, value in my_dict.items()` if you want that behavior now.
I know, but imo it just would make more sense to have it the other way around :)
The simplest thing you can do on Windows is probably to construct an [RTF](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=10725) file and open it with Wordpad or Word.
Cool. Could it be used with signals from wearable devices? Basically, would it make any sense or only input from medical grade equipment would yield anything useful.
Plaintext files don't have color sadly. Stdout is the only thing that can be colored because it's being interpreted by a terminal emulator like putty or xterm. You can use something like the termcolor package for python if you're wanting your print statements to be colorful. It places the correct code around a string you want to change the color of and the terminal shows that color when sent to stdout. https://pypi.python.org/pypi/termcolor
No it doesn't. You couldn't look it up. Dictionaries are one way, not two-way maps. It'd also be inconsistent with `key in dict`.
Actually, looks like there's a few ways to potentially do this requiring lexers and the pygments package. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17772255/python-write-colored-text-in-file
Before learning Python, I had been learning AngularJS; it's template interpreter has this format for iteration embedded into an attribute tag: &lt;div ng-repeat="key, value in object"&gt; {{ key }}, {{ value }} &lt;/div&gt; When I started in Python, I was sad when I couldn't do the same. At least in Python, we don't have to use the horrible `Object.keys(object).forEach((item) =&gt; { logic(item) })` like you have to do in JS.

I vaguely heard about that in passing but looking deeper, it might create more bizarre bugs in the code than I can afford because of subtle differences between POSIX and Microsoft. Going off on a quick tangent, I joked that some of cpython's maintainers must have been confused and didn't understand all the fuss about Py2.7 vs Py3 because they've been dealing with Win32 vs POSIX their entire careers. 
This is awesome! Coincidentally I have been working on exactly the same idea, but for someone like me, starting out in python, this will be an amazing learning opportunity! (Funny thing is, the prototype name of my project is TimeTracker, so quite the suprise to see it being used in the title. :D)
Do you mean packaging it into an exe? If it runs in the pycharm debugger you should be able to run it right in the command line just fine.
Great to hear! If you feel like contributing just reach out to us on the forum :)
If you have cURL: ```curl -OL "https://talkpython.fm/episodes/download/[0-138]" ```
You can do the same in python. You just do object.items() instead.
I might :)) 
I'm impressed that such a thing would exist in the open source space! Many could simply use that and create a startup out of it. Have you considered it?
"thing in dict" is equally problematic. It's ambiguous as to whether the thing is in the keys, the values or both. I'm positive this confusion has caused a lot of bugs over the years.
@kurashu89, i genuinely appreciate the thoughtful answer. i dont work with containers (or devops in general) and am trying to learn as much as possible. happy thanksgiving, friend!
"it’s entirely possible that there is no detectable pattern to changes in crypto prices; that no model (however deep) can separate the signal from the noise (similar to the merits of using deep learning to predict earthquakes)" No shit.
There's quite a few things like this I wish they'd done differently. The combination of people getting overly defensive about this kind of stuff and the near-zero chance of it changing means there's little point in bringing it up though. Warts like this stick around forever.
[Well, it doesn't stop them from trying](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/7eokux/develop_ml_for_predicting_the_price_in/?st=jacvbmg2&amp;sh=fdfd08cf)!

“How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python” by Allen B. Downey is great and I believe open source!
If you know that a `dict` is something like a hash table, then you know it obviously won't search the values as that would be an operation linear in the size of a table. i.e. you might as well use a list of 2-tuples.
Career or not, doesn't matter. You're doing what makes you happy. Python is an easy, abstract, way to program. For me, it's like digital legos. A lot of fun.
I agree that it wouldn't be bad to pass the environment as a variable to the step function, but just as an alternative, you can pass the environment as a parameter in the agent's init function and store a reference on the agent itself. This might be more appropriate than storing the agents in the environment, depending on what you're trying to model, or you can make the relationship bidirectional (that is to say, the environment will have a list of agents and each agent will store which environment it currently belongs to), with the only concern being that if you want to remove an agent you need to make sure you are doing it in both places. Without knowing more about what you are trying to model I can't give you better advice though.
This looks promising, and almost what I was looking for some weeks ago. But alas it's still useless for what I need to do.. When you're reading binary ordering and bytesize is critical. I assume ordering is in the order of field definition, but byte size is still "to do", and it seems like "something extra" instead of integrated in it. And variable text size, how are you planning that? When reading binary it's often something like this: &gt;there's a 4 byte header followed by a one byte protocol id and then four byte showing content length then 8 byte timestamp 1 byte for segments and then 4 byte id and 8 byte value for each segment, then unitid text field that's (length - (header + segments bytes + footer)) charactes in length, then 3 byte sequence number then 4 byte checksum. I'd really like to see the byte size being part of the field names, and features like being able to partially parse some data to get for example header *(for getting packet type and protocol id before processing the rest)* and ways to read variable length text more easily. 
I got pissed off at only finding proprietary or closed-source codes for the type of research I do in grad school, so I wrote a library from scratch and open-sourced it. I'm still in grad school, but at least now my data analysis is painless, and reviewers really appreciate it when you use open-source code in your articles. 
When you say ordering, if you’re talking about endianess this is most definitely a feature that I’ll be integrating. As far as size goes, using the `IntField` and passing in the `bit_len` parameter allows you to define a specific size. I believe that this is what you’re looking for. 
As far as variable text size goes, you are right that this currently is limited. But it’s just as limited as using the `ctypes.Structure` would be. If it’s something that absolutely critical for your needs feel free to create an issue on github and I’ll look further into it. This is still in a “beta” state in that there are quite a bit of features that are missing that I feel are pretty critical (endianess being one of them, implementing other fields like strings and floats being another). If this gets enough attention and certain issues become more popular than others I’ll focus my work on those first. 
Beginner here - I feel that with Python you can do a lot, and each library is specialized for their own purposes, so it really depends what direction you want to go. If you want to eventually make a game, do some simple games like tic tac toe, hang man, etc... If you want to implement it for work purposes, try writing scripts to automate emails/database... If you are looking to convenient your life, look into webscraping etc... I don't think there's a "correct" answer unless you know your direction. You can do a whole lot of training projects, but at the end of the day if they don't get you closer to your goal, you end up doing a whole lot of re-training anyways. For example I wanted to write a game, but my knowledge is limited so I take it step by step. First started with a dice roll game and a hangman with some pretty decent results, then I started looking into pygame for GUI solution, and it was kinda intimidating so I looked for other projects to get me acquainted. I started looking into [Automate the boring stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) and find it's great for learning (shoutout to /u/AlSweigart/), did some mini projects to scrape my favorite sites for updates and hooking it up with IFTTT... then for work I started experimenting email alerts for database updates, etc etc... But after all that's said and done, I was no closer to my end goal of wanting to create a game. Sure I learned a whole lot about BeautifulSoup and pyodbc, pyperclip etc... but I can't use that effectively in my goal. TL;DR: Search for projects that are relevant to your end goal for learning Python.

I'm confused by the word "packets", as that suggests to me the networking context of IP packets and Ethernet frames. It looks like you're talking about C `struct`'s (or I guess the generic CS term is [records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_(computer_science))?)
I've been told often that it's a hell of a pain to create a successful startup based on technology/algorithms (FDA approvals and such). So, in my opinion, this is the next best thing, as the public will receive the solution, as well as improve upon it tremendously in a collaborative effort. @op, thanks for this library.
I know this. I was comparing `Object.[keys|values|entries](object)` to `object.[keys|values|items]()`

When # running in production *do not* leave this option enabled. os.environ['OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT'] = '1' service = get_authenticated_service() channels_list_by_username(service, part='snippet,contentDetails,statistics', forUsername='GoogleDevelopers') For example this code works. It will print the 1st sample. When i try and use a loop it never works and I dont' know what I have to do at all. I have tried for item in results: print results ['id'] print results['items']['snippet']['title'] Doesn't work so I'm missing something
In my first code if you just printed the results then the whole json response would print. I try and say for item in results or item in results.get and a lot of other random things I see from googling but nothing is working for me.
Could it be loading the wrong version of that DLL? I just did a search on my system and I have a copy in `C:\Anaconda3\Library\bin` and also a second copy that is part of my Adobe AE installation. Is it possible that some other software on your system has installed a different version of that DLL and that one is found before the one from your Anaconda install?
Not to advertise or anything, but I am making a game in Python 3 on Github, the code is simple, you can download it and fiddle with it, see what makes it tick. It might teach you some things about opening and reading files! [Terminal Story](https://github.com/WeepierTadpole8/Terminal-Story)
I'm curious now. I have never been a power vim user, so I didn't manage to understand those buffer/window/tab things. I am using pycharm now and jumping to definitions under cursor/usages/symbols + move to previous/next cursor positions somewhat solves majority of navigation issues (not always though). I am curious about how people manage navigating large codebases in vim and having 300 tabs opened at the same time and not getting lost? Just remembering whole projects layout? Or looking at import statements and traversing every "input chain" (module level import, submodules,...) by hand? That is also quite likely that lack of quick auto navigation tools encourages having better structured projects :) 
I can print the whole response or I can print one item and nobody on reddit or stackoverflow can tell me how to use a for loop. Honestly this is just frustrating because I tried about ten different things I found from googling it and they all don't work for me so I just can't do it.
Makes sense I suppose. Thank you!
I never thought releasing docs early was a thing, but it sounds helpful. Thanks!
&gt; If it’s something that absolutely critical for your needs feel free to create an issue on github and I’ll look further into it. I'm working with a lot of GPS car devices of various types, and all of them send in binary data of various formats. Also, all of them send in a string identifier, where you have to know the length. Some post the length right before the string, some expects you to calculate the "leftover" of the total length. Anyway, for all of them we need to read strings that have variable length. And I made my own little ctypes wrapper, working on streaming bytes approach. I thought some perspective from someone that has to read a lot of binary data from various devices might be interesting, and also for me it might be a good tool in the future if it gets those features.
Sure, sorry, I might have put it too strongly. That is quite likely that I just didn't manage to understand vim well enough. I use it for remote editing and editing system configs all the time! And thankfully other pieces of software often have vim modes now, like sharelatex, which is very useful indeed! 
From what I can tell, python is never actually added to the PATH variable. [Picture:](https://i.imgur.com/QP8AB7y.png) What should I enter to add it manually here?

# *Excellent* This may help a lot with decoding CAN frames at work. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus#Data_transmission
I work in the space industry where we deal with custom or unique packets over interfaces other than tcp/ip. One example would be 1553 packets. This project was started as a way for me to be able to parse these type of packets or embedded packets within the UDP later. It’s in this context that I’m using packets. 
Yeah, initially I thought it was a way to create a simple Twitter clone or such.
Those entries assume your installation is in `C:\Anaconda` of course. There is also a user PATH variable you might check. I recommend [Rapid Environment Editor](https://www.rapidee.com/en/about) for mucking around with these things.
I modified the actual paths to match the install location of my Anaconda, still the same error.
When you say you program to make money, did you find a job in the field, or do you just do freelance work? I am currently working on learning Python and looking into trying to make the move to development as a career. Any insight as to how others have done so is always helpful.
Have you searched for the file mkl_intel_thread.dll? Maybe it isn't getting installed or if there is another copy I would try temporarily renaming it. Also, if you don't get the error when running a python program from a command prompt then maybe it's something to do with your pycharm installation/setup.
I started with freelancing to individuals and small organizations, which was all I was comfortable with at the time. There are many individuals and small organizations that need something basic developed, but don't know how to do it themselves. I started on Fiver, helping do people's programming homework, building interfaces or automating a set of task. The most complicated projects involved integration between two data apis (Discord and Facebook) or anything requiring simultaneous operations and an intricate data structure. Each project was a gig that paid a small 50-200, fixed price. I'd have a new client every other day so things would add up. Currently, I develop for a career. But it's just a side job. Technology is not actually a passion of mine, I hate all of it, but I'd rather not be dependent on a developer to do things I know I'm capable of doing for myself. 
This looks like [google's protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/).
I'll try to answer point by point, I appreciate your curiosity. &gt; I am using pycharm now and jumping to definitions under cursor/usages/symbols + move to previous/next cursor positions somewhat solves majority of navigation issues (not always though). I am curious about how people manage navigating large codebases in vim and having 300 tabs opened at the same time and not getting lost? Just to be clear, "tabs" in vim don't mean quite the same thing as IDEs, although they look similar from the outside looking in. Tabs are basically just a "view" of your open buffers, and buffers are a better analogue for tabs as they relate to IDEs, and buffers are just open in the background (you can access or open any buffer from within any tab). I usually have one tab open per "workflow", which is maybe like one per git branch I'm working on, and I'm navigating between some arbitrary number of buffers in a workflow. As for navigation, there are tons of methods for different situations, but I'll list a couple that are relatable for IDE users: You can fuzzy search files / open buffers / lines inside files in your project using a plugin like fzf or ctrlp; you can do the "jump to definition/class" thing with ctags which are arbitrarily configurable for different filetypes / symbols; you can ag/ack arbitrary strings or *text objects* (text objects are the most important reason why vim is so amazing btw, you should look these up); you can type "gf" on top of a symbol to "go to file"; and perhaps most usefully (to me at least) you can traverse your buffer history, which is basically the same as having a bunch of tabs open except you don't have to bother with that. Combining these methods you can traverse related files and jump back and forth between them with very, very few key presses, and more importantly, very little mental effort. Uh, there's also a project drawer thing in vim called netrw for navigating through project directories. Not super useful but worth mentioning. &gt;I also guess that there aren't many safe project-wise refactoring tools for vim, right? There most definitely are, and I'll describe just one of the most powerful: In vim, macros are incredibly useful. You can basically describe arbitrarily complex search/replaces with them (without even having to flex your regex muscles), and then just say "run this macro 999 times in this file" and it will go until it can't search and replace anything else. Of course, changing which file you're looking at can also be included in a macro, but we don't have to bother with that. When you ag/ack for a string or text object like I mentioned above, all the results are placed into a list called the quickfix list. Vim has a command called `:cfdo &lt;insert your command here&gt;` that runs an arbitrary command on all the files in the quickfix list. Of course, you can choose "run this macro 999 times" as your command (or literally anything else - I can't stress enough that this unlocks like arbitrarily powerful editing). So, filter out files from the quickfix list as needed, and run your command on all the files, refactor complete! If you read this whole thing that's commendable, I find it hard to not be very wordy when talking about vim. If there's one take away I would say if find yourself asking "can vim do this" the answer is almost certainly yes, and it's basically a life long learning process.

Python tutorial in a rainy afternoon at work in 1999. I needed to do something quick with data and PHP wasn't cutting, so I tried following the tutorial. Was blown away immediately. Today I use for most things, and it landed me at least 4 different positions over the years... and I could work with it for the rest of my life, really. 
I'm a computer professional. Systems engineer. I used to use Perl for most of my projects, and now I use Python. Python is quite sane and easy to read, and there are tons of libraries to help getting things done. Right now I'm on my couch. Thanks for asking.
I don't, but having done it I can see how it's a little more high level than what Celery does. If such a library existed it would be great if it supported different patterns - my thing had tasks dependent on each other, so I ran the ones with no dependencies first and worked my way through the tree. Redis was used to queue up tasks that had no dependents (so could be picked up by the next celery task), and another queue for tasks that had dependencies - so could't run yet. To make implementation easier I used an ORM for Redis: Redisco.
Nice. Some notes: - `functools.total_ordering` simplifies your `ComparableCounter` class - There's an ordering of mana within a cost, it might be useful to keep that in mind (costs are always printed in WUBRG order, with split mana also following that form). - C and 1 are not quite the same, when dealing with costs. (something that produces 1 is the same as something that produces C, but something that costs 1 is different than something that costs C).
This looks really interesting! One of the goals of my project is to make the packets as easy to read and configure as possible. A quick look at this project this looks like it’s a little more like `ctypes.Structure` which can be a little confusing at times.

You should try using it. If you have a better way of specifying protocol buffers, it might be easier to just contribute a patch or produce a higher-level library that sits on `protobuf`.
The problem with sitting on top of this is it appears the protobuf requires compiling which would make having a pure python library wrapping this a little more complex. 
Discord API is the best, so fun to learn and see what ur bot can do after awhile
Been using ubuntu forever, tried a few others, came to the conclusion that you can twist any of them to whatever you want it to be usage wise, the tools to do so just vary a bit. Ubuntu being a very popular one, it's well supported, you sometime have to fight the system if you really want something weird, but it's still very hackable, and robust (imho) for an user-friendly system. (and by hackable, i mean i use i3 and vim and neomutt and compile a few things manually, and install programs using pip to separate them from the env, i wrote a few custom systemd config files for my stuff, etc).
You don't need to compile anything. Just can just install it from pypi and import the library.
That's what I ended up doing, I store a reference of the environment in the init of each agent. It's not too important to run multiple environments at the same time so I don't *have* to make the relationship bidirectional for now. That being said, how would you achieve this exactly, out of curiosity? Thank you!
His is what I got from their [documentation](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/pythontutorial) &gt; Now that you have a .proto, the next thing you need to do is generate the classes you’ll need to read and write AddressBook (and hence Person and PhoneNumber) messages. To do this, you need to run the protocol buffer compiler protoc on your .proto:
I've been learning Python for Data Analysis, I spend most of my time learning how to convert sets of data to different types of sets of data. It's really rewarding watching a larger set get coverted in a" If this, then that" statement, and it being all neat and tidy at the end.
Oh, thanks for asking the question for me!
Right, you need to transform the proto file into a python module that you import. The transformer could have been written in Python (but it's not).
So, how does it compare to [Scapy](https://github.com/secdev/scapy), [Hachoir](http://hachoir3.readthedocs.io/), [Construct](https://github.com/construct/construct) and [Kaitai](http://kaitai.io/)?
Having classes inside another class, you would think this is easy. You will need to pass the outer class instance into the inners constructor.
Check out scapy. You should be able to use it in place of Wireshark to capture packets. Python's built in email library can handle the rest.

Oh interesting, apparently that changed in Khans. 
Subprocess is going to be your friend if all you have is standard Python and Wireshark. Suggest syslog instead of email; email is never the answer. Never.
Seconded. I loved this book and recommend it to all beginners. It gives a great introduction to the language by giving the user a lot of different projects to work on, as opposed to just listing how things work and expecting someone to memorize them. 
Yessss. I always recommend it. Using the author's suggestions for solving the problems before coding anything were so incredibly helpful to me as a novice. I mean, I'm still kinda novice. But it has pushed me along quite nicely.
I’m a machine learning engineer, and will say that this is a big project for a beginner. However, the place to start would be with the opencv library for image recognition, and scikit-learn for machine learning. 
As I understand it, if there’s any hope for getting it right, the devil lies in picking valid signals. Sentiment analysis of forums talking about cryptocurrencies, prices and volume of alternative cc’s, confidence indicators in other currencies and markets, etc. what sorts of news cause people to be inclined to buy or sell? 
These all seem pretty interesting and pretty solid projects. The goal of mine was to create a packet creating and parsing in pure python that was easy to use. But probably the most important thing was for me to learn by doing and generate a master project so I could graduate ;)

I was initially thinking of using `functools.total_ordering` but I guess it doesnt work with subclasses of dict, and there can be situations with `ManaCost` where two costs are both less than or equal (This might be wrong behavior, I admit). I'll have to update the readme regarding `{C}`, I should've double-checked that. Anyway, thanks for the advice, it's much appreciated 
You’re right. I was just frustrated by the way she gave the class. I’ll check the book out when I can!
Celery’s use of RabbitMQ for communication with workers is just an implementation detail. It works great for distributing functions but it’s not great for data pipelines. I built a messaging system with a lightweight abstraction over pika. At the time I couldn’t find a library or framework that did what I wanted. If the complexity is too much then I would question your choice of messaging queuing entirely. I found this book to be a great source of inspiration with my project: https://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Integration-Patterns-Designing-Deploying/dp/0321200683
Adding this comment to the README would be really useful!
The hope is that this tool will be useful for tcp/ip packets as well. In fact I want to have some built in packets that are already preformatted tcp/ip packets. 
Also, plenty might just not have realized that you could add that information in `setup.py`. Or maybe just didn't feel like bothering as it's rare for someone to discover modules through PyPI anyways. Not saying that anyone shouldn't link their repo (might as well), but I'm not sure if there's a real big positive benefit from doing so.

But it's not passive income
interesting... how much can you make with this? Oportunity to automate android games sounds awesome :D
There's that thing I wrote that deposits the rounding errors for floats in an offshore account. Thank God for that fire.
Question isn't just about passive income.
You wouldn't want to store references to the agents in the environment to support multiple environments, you would do it so that it's easier to write a function in the environment class that affects all of the agents in that environment. For example, and forgive me if this is way off from what you intend, but suppose the environment is harsh, you can loop through all of the agents in the environment and subtract from their health to model that. To do that, I'd make a dictionary called agents in the environment class, and have a function "register" in that class which takes an agent and adds it to the dictionary. Then, I would call that function from the agents init method. That way the environment has access to all of the agents through the dictionary, and each agent has access to the environment through the reference it keeps. I would use a dict instead of a list to make removing an agent from the environment easier, but if that's not required a list is fine. With a dict, you will need some way of uniquely identifying each agent, so that you know which agent to remove. 
Yes, I automated one aspect of testing process in company that I work at using Python.
Did you get to keep the stapler at least?
I've made 60k this year using python for automation... It's easy money for the amount of work required. I'm my own boss.
I think infrared is missing for working properly...
Do you care to elaborate a little?
It depends on how passive you are on your job!
Yes. It can be used with signals from wearable devices as well. This is actually what we are aiming at - to collect data from many devices (smartphones, watches, heart monitors, etc) to analyse a person's state online. This is especially important for ill people or high performing athletes.
i have a dead fish handshake
Did you made the GUI too?
That's one of the goals - to lower entry barriers for startups and even individual developers. Anybody can create its own ML application for home and professional use. It isn't only doctors and healthcare specialists, but also for athletes, drivers and others interested in their own health state.
https://medium.com/@carlorevelli/how-to-make-your-own-trading-bot-83b5c6e35036 I made a trading bot that arbitrages, pretty cool stuff. Also working on an updated version that uses another library. Made $1000 over two months so far. 
 It's a blackhat method. I'm not even sure if I could write about it here so I'll keep it simple. I created a bot that goes around YouTube. Making the most realistic top comment possible promoting whatever I need to promote at the time. 
Every five seconds. That was risky. 
Good point. We definetely will in the near future.
Yeah I thought they would bloke my ip after a couple days but they didnt. Every 5 sec isnt that risky after all.
No need to sugar coat it, you're a spammer..
I make around a Euro a day with automatic Ethereum trading. Maybe in a couple of years I made enough money to justify the time investment of a hundred or so hours, haha.

This is quite interesting, how much capital did you start with to earn that? Also do you host it on AWS etc to be closer to certain stock exchanges?
I thought about there must be a way to put channel IDs into a file or something as well instead of just pasting them in as a huge list. I know there is a 50 channel limit which is fine I think that using batch requests used to be a thing but maybe it doesn't exist any more and you use nextpagetoken or something. I'm a complete noob as you can tell so I don't really know anything :D
But thank you so much :D
Well it's YouTube. Spam or not the comments are cancer.
Hosting it on a cheap vps I bought with bitcoin. I had like $500 starting capital.
Indeed, you need to use `nextPageToken`, in the first response you will get a `nextpageToken` value (if more results are available) which you can then feed into another call to `list()` as `pageToken=response['nextPageToken']`. In my script I basically just created a while loop whose condition was that as long as a `nextPageToken` existed it would append the current results to a list and make the request again with the new token. Now this is only relevant if you search by a really common username and multiple results would be returned I believe.

The python documentation clearly says keys are returned when iterating a dictionary. 
Not exactly what you were asking, but I once had a job which was 90% coalescing data from multiple government reports into one spreadsheet and forwarding it to my boss. It took me about 20min to write a script that did all of the work for me. After automating the bulk of my job, it essentially became passive income.
Hahahahaha. Nice!
I mean...I have automated processes at work using Python and I get a paycheck.
&gt; made money/have a passive income But really, if you automate a bunch of processes, it'll look like you are doing more work. Then you say you are going to be "moving on to another opportunity", they see how much work they'll have to start doing themselves, you get a raise and boom: more income.
would you like to share a little more detail with us, without giving away your prize? (like, are you basically comparing 2 moving averages and ride the wave, or do you follow a more complicated strategy?)
It started out very simply by comparing trajectories. If the price is on a downward trajectory for a while and then goes into an upward trajectory, the algorithm assumes the price is in a "valley". Now there's obvios problems with that, because I'm rarely lucky enough to buy during the day's low point and I seldom sell during the day's actual peak. But it's enough not to lose money. I started the project thinking that volatility would be my friend, but it's actually quite neutral. Minute-to-minute volatility hurts and day-to-day volatility helps. 
ok, you also won the price for the easiest solution here. Incredible! hahaha
What'd you do about the transfer times? Sometimes it seems like it takes forever to transfer crypto, did that affect your trades.
Wasn't that easy. Some of the APIs are either not documented or just plain don't exist.
If you have large datasets, consider changing the backend, or reducing the number of points you actually plot. Or, maybe use something else to help with the plotting (say, holoviews and bokeh).
You can just open the directory in the command line, and say `python filename.py`. If you want to allow commands, you can use `sys.argv` for that. Better yet, look up something like Click, docopt, or fire.
I'm finding the transactions costs usually nullify any potential profits, until the fluctuations are really wild.
Automated an email system for a client that got it's data from government created CSVs. It was pretty dope. Got a few grand.
ok, I believe so, sorry. Let's say the idea looks simple from first view. And Kudos that it worked! :)
That's why I don't benefit from minute-to-minute volatility.
I made a little automated trading app using a library I found to plug into Robin Hood. That said, I actually lost money not made it so try at your own risk. (I went green for about 2 or 3 days before the system made a series of disastrous trades and pissed away a few grand)
We'd love to hear about your needs and how we might be able to help fulfill them, just create a post on the forum or throw me an email :)
Strangely enough, I think the hardest part was "appearing" to be a young female. Poor grammar is difficult for me.
It seems that are you using an EMA based on a day windowing for catching the trend. Is it right?

I just bought a bunch a cheap android phones 5-10 dollars each and a small 30 dollar pc on eBay. The pc ran Ubuntu and I connected the phones to the pc via USB and used adb to interact with the devices. Quite a few of the apps pretty much spelled out what they were doing in the logs. The scripts monitored the logs via logcat.

Tshark is the command line part to wireshark so Google around about that. Also it is essentially the same tech as tcpdump. The pcap file they both output can be read by wireshark. Email is not going to make it easy to parse any raw output from any network app.
I once worked for a company that sold insurance to realtors. In an effort to increase sales, they bought these huge ass excel sheets of everyone in the United States with a realtor's license. Then, they hired like ten 20-somethings to pick through the list and rate the size of each realtor's operation. I claimed car trouble and worked from home and then automated the whole thing. All you had to do most of the time was look at google results and street view. I set up an approval system and queue so that it wouldn't go too fast (wasn't trying to get rid of this job), and a system to submit my decisions to their online form. I did that job for about 5 months from home--essentially getting paid 6-8 hours a day for what took me like 25-40 minutes.

&gt;If you know that a dict is something like a hash table That isn't something you should have to know in order to use a dict. &gt;you know it obviously won't search the values as that would be an operation linear in the size of a table That isn't obvious in the slightest. Moreover, if the semantic meaning of a language construct depends upon you inferring its intended behavior from low level implementation details then it's *obviously* not clear enough.

Yeah. But they stole it from Superman III.
You can avoid transaction costs if you do it right. Explore trading on GDAX using sell limits.
It's called salami slicing, and it's been used in a lot of movies.

Nice try, boss.
I was working on trying to find momentum indicators. Despite my initial testing and some good picks it had made before it was connected to an account it didn’t do very well in the wild lol. You live and learn, I’m still working on it, maybe one day it’ll make a trade that doesn’t loose money haha
Why?
Congrats on helping ruin online advertising for everyone else. 
Yeah, well, that's just, like, your opinion, man
I know you're trying to automate my job and fire me.
You’re taking money and advertisers get nothing. That makes the ecosystem worse, causes them to spend more on fraud detection, and makes less money available to good apps/websites that provide content actual humans want to see. Lie to yourself however you want, but you’re making the world ever so slightly worse. 
You only lost the grand if you traded it away. But my stocks haven't rebounded yet. I hope the company rebounds with Canadians next oil rush
Again, that is your opinion. Why don't you try and contribute something meaningful to this thread like a project that generated you some passive income.
see my response to /u/westscz
This one is my favourite so far.
Advertisements deliver malware and with e.g. Apple providing a system wide ad blocker it is just a matter of time until ads are not used to earn money in the first place. Everyone who forces uncontrolled data streams (read as: malwaretisement) onto my phone deserved to get "gamed". 
Exactly. 1. Automate process. 2. Don't inform peers. 3. Appear to be a miracle worker while using reddit.
 1961 book by Harry Harrison "The Stainless Steel Rat" has a similar scheme, and I bet it wasn't his original idea either. 
Looking forward to see the results. I briefly looked into the heartrate streams from strava, but the resolution there is 1 sec. im not sure whether they downsample it or it is a typical resolution that ant+ wearables do return.

Poor advertisers how will they recover 
Had a customer who used shitty database software for all their important documents related to their work. The software was tailored for his market, and targeted to his type of company. Last IT guy knew fuckall and should be ashamed. He left the access point wide open and the file server with write access to all. Sitting ducks for losing millions in revenue. The DB software company was defunct, and the database would no longer read, but the database kept all files in the same original format, and just fucking renamed everything to hash values. User needs to be able to search files by name, and with those hash names, it was almost hopeless. I proposed an idea: 1. OCR all documents using acrobat pro trial 2. Use python and regex on text file output to determine what filename should be based on contents of the file 3. Rename all original files to the correct string It took hours of testing on test documents, and there were issues with collisions (Customer told me there wouldn't be any...) but I got past it and charged them 600 dollars for my time. 
If that is what your coworkers are doing then I would say they are incompetent. If an answer is that easy to find, they shouldn't be making those kinds of mistakes. And it makes perfect sense why a dictionary would iterate over the keys. The key is what makes the entry unique.
I automated most of what I do. Now I just go to meetings, read the news, and e-mail the results of automated processes. Every now and then, I automate something else. It's pretty passive.
Spoiler alert: this isn't possible in equity anymore. As a retail investor you're at the very least a decade too late. Please do yourself a favor and stop immediately!
&gt; Now I just go to meetings We have some unbelievably stupid PowerPoint format for all of our 'weekly standups'. Version control is ``StandupMeeting_Nov242017.ppt```. Plus we e-mail that around so we'll have ``StandupMeeting_Nov242017_version1.ppt```, ``StandupMeeting_Nov242017_version2a_PurdueME06.ppt```, ``StandupMeeting_Nov242017_FINAL2.ppt```, etc. I made a git repo and made up a pseudo standardized markup format (# starts a new slide, etc). Wrote a Python script to mash it up with our corporate powerpoint template. - "Hey PurdueME06, we're need to use this new template, how long do you think it'll take" - "Oh, give me a day" - "Awesome" - Reddit until noon. Change the template path. Run ```make```. "Hey, I had some extra time. Here's everything early" - "Woa PurdueME06, that's amazing. Great job again" - "Yeah, uh sure."
I would *never* do that! -Puts pink slip in back pocket-
How long did it take you to get the setup working?
What library?
I'm pretty sure I remember reading about Ancient Greek shopkeepers who'd line their change purses with sharkskin so that the gold coins they handled would be slowly abraded. The coins often didn't belong to them on either end of the transaction, as they'd go into debt every morning, but when they'd settle up in the evening they'd keep the lamb's share of their profit, plus a little bit of dust. It's called *sweating* and, though I loved the Rat, it's probably been around since we figured out that people with big pockets don't always notice small losses.
What do you mean by automating them?
I prototyped it in a day and worked on code over time.
Code played the games / apps.
And how does that generate income?
Yeah - I was just trying to point out that it's not a new idea, and that the idea that somehow "superman III" was the origin was... uh... not well founded.
The points could be redeemed for gift cards and PayPal.
Could you post the link of the library that works with RobinHood? I've been looking for something like that.

That is NOT a mundane detail, Michael!
I first started learning Ruby as I wanted to get into programming, web development was the low hanging fruit at the time, and I kept hearing about Ruby on Rails. Well, I went to the community college and the first programming course that you took was in Python. I immediately got hooked on how easy the language was, how much the standard library had to offer right out of the box, the helpful community as well as how much the community contributed to the language in terms of third party packages for all sorts of things. 
&gt; try to get around tyrannical IT "This will save us $50k a year in dongles by reducing the number we need" You let your boss's boss's boss do the hard work. &gt; python:( WinPython &amp; PortableApps. Our draconian scanners haven't found them yet because they're not 'installed' and don't show up in the registry. Plus no admin access.
Last week you asked how to start a script on another computer. (https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/7cd0kp/how_do_i_activate_python_code_from_another_pc) This is such a basic question you can look up on Google. I highly doubt you've made 60K
Usual ANT+ HRM can monitor only heart rate. But there are modern ones, like Quardiocore, which record a normal ECG.
I'm working on a website that will be used to give consumers info on hybrids and battery cars. The database is on MySQL, but I spend most of my time creating tools on Python that can be used to automate the process by which data (on vehicles, emissions, etc.) gets imported. 
I can't even run un-approved exes, so portable apps don't work. I should talk my boss into giving me a laptop, those are less closed off

Just write a custom parser, take the first two characters of each line. Then you can use [yattag](http://www.yattag.org/) to wrap around new tags, then save that as a file. You could create a dictionary mapping of your custom characters to html attributes, or similar.

Four 8-hour days as a contractor? ~$4k–5k
awesome, thanks for this. audio seems to be one of the big things I have problems with in python. I've been listening to Severed Heads a lot lately and they seem to be one of the few bands to do video synthesis - [although the quality is garbage, 20 years of VHS decay + youtube compression kinda ruins it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OjAnr4dsLs)
You can use the [html module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.parser.html) in the standardlib like so: from html.parser import HTMLParser test = """&lt;p&gt;Check our new website &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;at www.example.com and convert &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;more than this. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align='center'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tester &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;""" class MyHTMLParser(HTMLParser): def __init__(self): super().__init__() self.output = [] self.bold = False self.align = 'L' def get_output(self): return '/n'.join(self.output) def handle_starttag(self, tag, attrs): if tag == 'b': self.bold = True else: self.align = dict(attrs).get('align', 'left')[0].upper() def handle_endtag(self, tag): self.bold = False def handle_data(self, data): if data.strip(): self.output.append(['N', 'B'][self.bold] + self.align + data) parser = MyHTMLParser() parser.feed(test) result = parser.get_output() print(result) other options are using BeautifulSoup or lxml to parse the html, loop over the parsed html and do your conversions. I bet those are faster than python's builtin html module.
Eh, it's a friend of the family, the job was going to cost them $300, so I doubled it and said I'd get it done faster. 
in what kind of industry / career path can you do this?
Like the other guy says, somewhere in that range. I was thinking more in line with what you saved that business, and to be sure to take your rightful cut of that. I have no way of guessing that, but I would have started my bid at 10 times what you got, 6k or so.

I played the games and interacted with the apps
Not trying to be rude but the general consensus in this thread seems to be "no"
Not 100% passive, but probably 90%+. I buy and sell sports tickets on 3rd party websites. Think Stubhub, ticketmaster, craigslist. I stumbled upon this market because I have season tickets for a team so I was already watching prices for specific games. It has actually been very successful now for the past 14 months and I've made ~ half a years salary thus far. I say it's not all automated because actually buying the tickets is difficult to automate and there's a small bit of admin work so I can file taxes accurately.
Must be a quick learner
What you want to do is create a new column index and and apply it to you dataframe. In this case, you want to MultiIndex. df = pd.DataFrame({'a': [1, 2, 3], 'b': [4, 5, 6], 'c': [8, 9, 0]}) I could do, with your helper function: df = add_column_level({'X': ['a', 'b'], 'Y': ['c']}, df) Or I could do: df.columns = pd.MultiIndex(levels=[['X', 'Y'], ['a', 'b', 'c']], labels=[[0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 2]])
My going contract rate is 800-1000 a day, and that is considered low by most people who pay it. This is in the US though.

You didn't use a test trading account?
fuck those capitalist pigs, man
Yeah, I saw that in the docs, but I really wanted to just create a dict that says "associate these existing columns with this group" and use that to modify my dataframe. I've since added a way to do this using the MultiIndex exactly as you suggest. My original take on this actually has some nice flexibility in that I can subset columns off an existing dataframe, or include columns in more than one group. Here's where I am now: """ column_levels This module provides two functions for adding a level to the row index of a dataframe. add_column_level expects all columns in the dataframe to be in the design dict exactly once and allows inplace modification. new_column_level provides simple construction of a dataframe that includes a new hierarchical column index given a dict of group names associated with lists of existing columns. The columns here can be a subset of the columns in the dataframe and columns can appear more than once. """ __version__ = 0.2 from collections import OrderedDict from pandas import MultiIndex, concat def add_column_level(design, df_in, names=None, inplace=False): ''' Construct a new data frame with an added column hierarchy or add a level to the existing dataframe.

Hey, this was one of the very first things I did when I started programming in QBasic over 30 years ago -- I made [moire patterns](https://xkcd.com/1814/). Making a fan of lines with one point fixed works as well for certain line spacing values, and if you vary the color across a palette as you draw, and make very tightly spaced lines, you can make some very colorful and nice patterns, as I recall. Then I got into fractals and solar system simulation and strange attractors and a lot of other interesting stuff. 
Was this better returns than buying and holding?
Or from a place designed to host code https://github.com/schlueter/pysolar. 
I worked for a major technology company, and I basically figured out how to automate my job using a script. It worked for about a year, and during those times, I worked from home and did other stuff while my script did my job for me.
No but I once heard about a consultant that was good at automation without letting clients know. So he'd automate only to the point of him still having to start the job. And the clock started when the job did. While the job was running he could relax or do something else but the client was still billed for that time. And here I am automating the whole process away so I can take on new tasks. That shit piles up you know.
&gt; a function in the environment class that affects all of the agents in that environment Ah! Got it now. &gt; (...) function "register" (...) That's pretty nice, I will definitely implement this approach so that each agent can access the list of other agents in their environment to allow agent-agent collision avoidance. Thanks vbook !!
Maybe you should become a writer instead of programmer? Did you trashy think that anyone would read your essay? 
These people aren't experts. This article isn't worth reading.
Nice! I'm working on a similar project, but we the game camel up. Great job!
Nah, I'm a good developer. There is always a chance.
Default one is fine, but if I need many files open I use something like Geany. 
You should check r/algotrading! Automating trades and investment processes are huge! Even cryptos! You can check my blog where I try to teach how to build these systems for non professional traders
I am fairly sure your if statement is never evaluated as true. You are checking if a character in the string is equal to the list. Change '==' to 'in'.
Have you thought of porting this down to a C library?
Except the sun itself.
Read the side bar, then post in the appropriate sub
Sublime Text 3 is cool and multiplatform. You can find a few articles on how to make it work similar to IDE while keeping its memory consumption and speed reasonable
The problem begins at the ad agencies. They built a (broken) system of cheap views, hardly seen. Internet ads aren't very effective to begin with. This just advances the inevitable.
Data science. I maybe played it up a bit -- a big part of what I do is thinking through processes, trying to figure out a smooth, intelligent, accurate way to automate or approximate them. But a lot of what I automate are the kinds of things I used to automate back when I was an analyst -- stuff that's repetitive but complicated, and needs a lot of touching to be worked into a format where the math is easy to do. Make robots do that stuff.
You could learn along the process if you think you need to know Sockets to start you're an idiot and don't know Python. 
I really like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It is configurable, cross platform, free, and works great for Python. I strongly recommend the Python plugin and pylint
I call it a *job*.
Someone who actually makes 60k wouldn't say that in an attempt to convince me.
I only said it because you're annoying me. Here's your proof. https://prnt.sc/heuu2y Traffic now a days is money if you got it you can convert it to money.
what do I need to do to get into that field ?! (learn to program?) or just Excel/SQL/power query/power pivot ?! is it a stresfull career ? what kind of job are junior? and what kind of industry/cie hire junior in this? can you learn eveything on the job ?
Right mouse click, inspect element. Anyway, if that isn't the case then nice.
The only reason I keep PyCharm installed is because of the remote interpreter inside of a Docker container support. VSCode is pretty popular. I would try that or Atom.

No raspberry pi, I used some refurbished dell atom box that had a ton of USB ports. I had 10-20 phones running at one time over he years. I no longer do this for passive income.
Like I said, I do everything through third party sites, nothing to do with buying right when they go on sale (although I do occasionally try to get tickets that I know will resell). That said, no offense taken. 
Haha I was half kidding anyway. So what you have an algorithm or that averages out all the list prices of tickets, and buy the ones that are furthest under the average and resell them at the average price? Something like that?
Any reason to your stop or just didn't feel like keeping up with it anymore? I imagine it'd be pretty easy to just let it sit and collect income. 
I’ve moved on to different challenges. It was never solely about the money. I enjoyed the challenge of automating the apps especially when there was blatant attempts to prevent this from happening.
I second this. You can also run it with vim keyboard shortcuts! :)
Slicing.
Extremely unlikely.
I'm a new dev and am laid off so money is tight so I wanted something free or cheap. I looked at PyCharm, Atom, VSCode, and Sublime Text. I thought they were all good and had different pros and cons. I really wanted the PyCharm remote interpreter stuff to be easy to use but as someone who had never used PyCharm I didn't find it easy, nor did I find the documentation that helpful for a new user to get started with the feature (I was trying to use it with Vagrant) I'm sure it works OK once you figure it out but for $90/year it should be easy or better documented IMO. Just a personal preference but I don't care as much for the Eclipse style user interface experience. I'd guess for more experienced people who have used Eclipse style IDEs in the past this could be a pro, but for me it was not. Sublime Text 3 was also nice but IMO didn't offer enough for $80 over the free Alternatives of Atom and VSCode. That left Atom and VSCode. I liked both. Atom lets you split your coding windows both vertically and horizontally which I found useful and VSCode does not. I found more helpful Extensions in VSCode that covered all the various things I was doing (not just Python) so I ended up going with VSCode since the Extensions were more helpful than the horizontal windows splitting. I use VSCode on two different systems on Windows and on Linux and it works the same in both which is also nice. Electron apps aren't the leanest but I'd say try VSCode and Atom if cost is also a factor.
Perfect - thank you for this detailed answer!
Any reason behind that? Wouldn't hurt.
More or less. Also checking comparable listings, weather, prior events at the same venue, etc. Honestly it's successful without making it too complicated so I haven't tapped into this as much as it could be. The thing I made the most money on, and did over the summer until Stubhub told me I can't do anymore, is sell GA tickets weeks before the events and fulfill closer to game time with the hope that the price drops. If anyone ever wants to make money, find a site that lets you do that, or just do it on Stubhub at a smaller scale than I did. I made 5 figures a month just doing this for a few months.
I'm a completely new programmer- I started learning at the beginning of this month. I'd tried books and code academy before and didn't get far. November 1st I started using a mooc, and five courses later I'm automating work tasks and learning libraries that are relevant to me. I'm far from an expert, but moocs worked for me. 
Atom except it doesnt have an IDE for python, yet. They did just launch atom IDE though, so hopefully a python version will release soon. 
Do you mean like public/private? Here’s a good write up. http://radek.io/2011/07/21/private-protected-and-public-in-python/ Generally it’s really unnecessary and annoying to future developers (well ok maybe just to me) when you make stuff private in Python.
 def is_palindromic_parse(str): s = ''.join([c for c in str if c.isdigit()]) # remove digits s = s.lower() # convert to lowercase to ignore cases return s == s[::-1] # check whether the string is equal to it's reversed form
I'm sorry man.. i tried doing it for like hours..
Literally, google "__language__ robinhood". There's unofficial API wrappers in a bunch of languages, python being one of them.
the tinder for programmers is an interesting idea, but let's see if we can do something more practical.
Did you just switch accounts and not realize it?
Well, the field is pretty broad -- I'd say that analytics and data science are kind of rolled up together, because the field basically encompasses all data jobs, and data is huge right now, so as long as you have a basic math / business background, you'll be able to get in. But analytics is kind of separate from data science, in that for an analyst, the emphasis is on looking at data and explaining how whatever it says matters for a business; for a data scientist, the emphasis is on doing science -- I've found it to be more about formulating and testing hypotheses, and then generalizing your results so that they add to the business' industry knowledge. At all levels, Excel is a necessary skill. SQL is a bog-standard skill but not always necessary, power query / power pivot are more specialized, but can be useful, and are a good thing to have on your resume if you're looking to get into analytics. At higher levels, you'll end up learning specific tools and leaning a lot on specialized industry/domain knowledge, so it's harder to say with certainty what you need. To be a data scientist is a bit more difficult. The job tends to mean different things based on what industry/company you're looking at, but in general, data science is more about the science than the data. The common theme for data science is that you have the scientific grounding to come up with with a data-based question (and reformulate an existing business need/question so that it can be answered with data), identify what kind of data will get you to your answer, gather and wrangle/munge the data you need, then do statistical science on it to prove out your hypothesis. Right now, most data scientists will have an advanced degree in a STEM field, because you need to have a sophisticated understanding of how to answer questions using empirical science -- a skill that's typically only really taught/practiced at a higher academic level. That's not to say you NEED a PhD, but it can be challenging to get looked at seriously without one. The skills are, broadly: 1. Math, particularly statistics but also linear algebra 2. Enough coding skills to work with large data sets (Python and R are the clear leaders in this field) and to collect data in an automated way. 3. Solid understanding of scientific and research methodologies The first two skills aren't particularly hard to acquire (i.e., there's no real trick beyond just getting the education, either formally or informally), but the third is much more difficult to come by on your own. The work of a data scientist is pretty much equivalent to preparing and writing graduate-level research articles (I guess, technically, it's more like preparing a conference paper), which is a skill typically acquired in grad school by way of reading literally thousands of published, peer-reviewed research articles. Learning the basics of something like hypothesis testing isn't difficult, but it takes a lot of exposure to a lot of various and sundry research to develop a good feel for what constitutes solid quantitative analysis. That's not to discourage you if you don't have that background. It can all be learned. A lot of it CAN be learned on the job, but if you don't already have a foundation it's hard to even get a job (let alone really understand it, anyhow). I do not find it stressful, although I frequently end up presenting my findings in a kind of semi-formal presentation setting, and I'm often pressured to do things in ways that I don't think are going to generate the best results. In addition to everything I just said, you'll need to be the kind of person that's comfortable speaking to a group, defending your ideas, and saying "no" to your boss / higher-ups. My work is also often poorly defined, and I'm expected to deal with the ambiguity. I recently did a bunch of work to answer the questions "What's the difference between a good store and a bad store, and what should we do to turn a bad store into a good one?" Before I could even answer the question, I had to define the difference between "good" and "bad," decide which data would be best to measure that (detailed POS data from thousands of stores seems good, but P/L definitely matters, too, and do I care about customer attitudes towards a store, etc.), identify a bunch of possibly confounding variables (e.g., length of time the stores have been open, local population, local climate, etc.). Only after I had done all of that could I even start to think about how to go about answering the question.
Very nice! 
Their vendor has an API: https://developers.spot.im/open-api/text-only-import Probably your token expired or something. 
This is amazing, u/christophertacon! A few questions: are the locations dynamic in time, or hard-coded based on a specific time-step? I'd love to explore something similar looking at the positions of various objects across time. I also recommend uploading this to bitbucket or github... a readme would also be fantastic to help get my head around what each bit of the code does. Really interesting work!
It's so hard to be a noob these days. Everyone claims to be an expert and everyone claims to know the best path towards becoming a programmer. 
oh i don't really like the scientitif/analytic part... im more just a fan of getting data and putting them in a presentable/usefull way... si there a job for that?!| I am more looking to automate admin stuff 
Nah, it was way simpler. I culled data from a few .csv files, reformatted some of the data, and wrote it out to another .csv file. No one in the office was computer savvy enough to know that one could automate the process, so they had spent years manually searching the reports, and then copy/pasting it over a handful of records at a time. As mentioned in another comment, you should definitely pick up Automate the Boring Stuff.
Have you considered using historical data to train an [ANN]https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network)?
**Artificial neural network** Artificial neural networks (ANNs) or connectionist systems are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems learn (progressively improve performance) to do tasks by considering examples, generally without task-specific programming. For example, in image recognition, they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as "cat" or "no cat" and using the analytic results to identify cats in other images. They have found most use in applications difficult to express in a traditional computer algorithm using rule-based programming. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

Wow, clickbait much? 
Haha good eye
Finding a good editor / IDE / Dev environment is a really tough task. For me, as many here I've moved to VS Code. I used a lot of editors before that, but VS code really is nice to work with and I've moved wholesale to that one. It's relatively fast, have very good python support, and has easy to find plugins for most things. I can use it for JS, C# (core), HTML, xml.. Really recommend it :)
This is fantastic. For some reason when I looked at Aubio I couldn't fully think of a good architecture. This one is nice, I was trying to use FFTs in python and it was just too slow (especially with software based drawing).
I would suggest you take some time to learn vim or emacs. You won't have to find any other IDE for any language after than because you have the best tools already.
I haven't used TaskTiger so I can't fully endorse it but if Celery doesn't work out and you don't want to end up rolling your own solution entirely [TaskTiger](https://github.com/closeio/tasktiger) has sub-queues via `queue.subqueue` naming scheme which fits your requirement for `messages.contact.&lt;contact_id&gt;`. Clients can listen to a specific queue and will pick from a random sub-queue each time it pulls an entry.
Yeah, that sounds like a lot of analyst jobs -- pull data using SQL or some kind of BI tool, put it into Excel, wrangle it into a Pivot Table and chart it. Back when I was an analyst, I had a lot of regular reports that I did that I ended up automating (write the query, use Python to run it and pull the data into a dataframe, pivot it and do some math, and spit out an Excel file). Still a lot of ad hoc stuff, but also a lot of scripting and automation, and scripting to save myself time on simple tasks.
Porting what? Everything? We just wouldn't be able to do that. Too much work for us. 
Really you only need an IDE w/ as many features as you'll actually use - I use Jupyter for virtually everything I do out of habit, but that doesn't make it the 'best', just the best for my workflow - maybe try to work backwards from what's useful?
Normally, no. But it's technically labeled as a Microsoft Excel csv. If Iopen it with Excel instead of notepad it contains formatting info, or at least what I believe is formatting.
Many of my smaller one-offs I use git for, but do not upload to GitHub. Occasionally, for something useful but where people don't want others to see it, I upload to GitLab. Just yesterday, for example, I made a bunch of plots for the best RPM and pressure to use it you want for maximum range. Also, Notebooks are annoying to diff even with nbdime.
it wouldn't help.
It's seems to be the complete opposite.
You might try pandas. I don't know what kind of formatting you're looking for, but there is a function to export a data frame to an xlsx or xls file. It import in with some standard formatting based on the type of data. 
It should be on the Anaconda launcher
Are you Keanu Reeves?
and where is that supposed to be?
Hey, they all have some good and some bad stuff for whatever they can be used. Figure out those and make yours better for your use case! If you're really wanting to get something great out of it, maintain the project for reasonable time in github. Might get you damn good opportunities in the future! =)
I also don't feel that would really help, but I am always amazed how strongly Java and C++ developers disagree here. Same thing with getters and setters: direct modification of object attributes is mostly considered a horrible crime in Java and C++ and getters setters have to be defined for everything that should be accessible.
why not atom ?
I'm making an Arduino-based GPS logger for my racecar. Finally got it outputting nice CSV files, and I want to make some sort of GUI for it that runs on Linux. I've got a rpI in the closet, and a pocketBeagle coming in. I'm thinking once I get it running the Arduino will get ditched. Back to Python. I'm told it's the latest and greatest for what I need to do, which is parse GPS data, output it on a (sized-by-extents) map, and overlay several runs that are colored according to speed. Oh, and I need it to display the speed in realtime as well. So, after learning C++/Arduino last week (a refresher from 10 years ago in college), I'm learning Python this week. Any hints as far as parsing CSV's, designing/coding GUI's, or which IDE is the best for all this would be welcome!
I plan on keeping this one pretty up to date as best as I can. We'll see what comes of it. Luckily enough for me, I'm already working at a pretty killer job and get to write python. In fact this project was inspired from some of the stuff that I do at work. 
Was looking for a tool to visualize call graph of c functions, instead rolled my own using python and networkx library 😊
What mooc did you use?
How many times do I see Python overtaking R? 
Coursera. The concise introduction to python was an excellent place to start, but there is no specialization built after it so I had to review a lot of the material again. 
Thanks.

There are quite a few blogs and posts about specifically using LSTMs to try and model time-series data and specifically crypto-currency data. The overall TLDR of them is that it's not very effective. Mind you, most people were using 1-step ahead to train their models, which has it's own flaws for this type of analysis.
Interesting write-up. Had to make some tweaks to get it running on Ubuntu, it kept overflowing the PyAudio buffer and it didn't like the keyword art in the call to stream.read(). Fixed it by removing the keyword arg and catching IOError.
It would help if you explained what problem you're experiencing. Are you getting a syntax error? Does the method not seem to do anything at all? If you print the contents of the list, what do you see? 
These two are my favorites: * VSCode does a lot of things right, including fast, regular updates. * [ActiveState Komodo Edit](https://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit) (free, open-source) doesn't get mentioned a lot, but it's terrific If you have issues with RAM use, avoid Atom.
OP said PyCharm was using too much RAM, so Atom isn't going to help his/her situation.
I would highly recommend VSCode over Atom.
I think you need to reinstall.
If `points` is a method, you need to call it lambda player: player.points()
Yes and yes. /r/learnpython for any further questions will get you better answers.
Thank you so much.
Learning Linux would be the biggest win. What stuff are in your interviews that you haven't felt strong in? Beyond basic python topics are generators, inheritance/super, the GIL/threading/multiprocessing/async, numpy, c extensions (cffi)...
But wasn't there an old action movie (something like mission impossible or something else) where this "rounding error in an offshore account" thing was the main villain's big thing? This trick rings a bell (from a long time ago) to me too and I've never watched office space.
Let me know if you ever want to go to a game! 
Lol wtf is this? Sounds pretty sketch.
Are you incapable of writing more than a single sentence at a time actually explaining what it is the OP asked? How does Python come into play, did it require machine learning? How can automating the usage of an app make money?
Thanks for the contribution. How exactly did this make you a passive income?
I found 2 python courses in this whole list. gtfo
If you're going to share, please do. But if you can't actually describe what you've done or answer a question, you may as well have just made something up
How exactly does this make you money? Do you like farm items and sell them to other players?
Played games for chance to win points and watched ads for points. Redeemed points for GC and PayPal.
Decided to create an exploding dice rolling program for resolving character actions. 
I started out with a language called Lua, which was embedded in Minecraft using a mod called ComputerCraft - today I contribute to the mod itself (Java), and am majoring in SE. My first real project was a customizable scrolling text display. Looking back, it really wasn't too far from "Hello World". Aside from that, I've always liked writing simple games - Stacker (CC), Othello (CC &amp; Java), a clicker game (JS), Guess the Number (C++), etc.

TLDR: Automated a error processing job for a major project and spent six months getting payed to monitor the scripts remotely a few times a day between movies and long lunches with friends. This was years ago. But I had a job at a startup, simple systems admin gig for a SaaS supply chain management company. When I was hired we did maybe 1K transactions in a good month, this was our POC period and we only handled a few low volume products for a couple of clients. Transaction errors were handled by hand, and I would have to validate email or physical addresses and remediate errors to make sure an order was processed correctly. I would get two or three errors a day and spend about 10 minutes per error fixing them. Anyway, after I was there about three months we landed our first major client, a consumer electronics manufacturer that was about to launch a major product in the US. They had botched the Asia launch and called us in to handle their order processing and supply chain dispatching. I told my boss that our current process wouldn't scale and I wanted some time to work on automating it. He said no because I had other higher priority tasks on my plate. So we rush through a build for the client and their launch goes great, instead of the launch orders crashing their systems we accepted almost 100K orders in the first 12 hours to their delight. Their 12 hour mark was just about the time I rolled into work that post launch morning. Needless to say I was greeted by my boss and our CEO calling a meeting to discuss the 16K order errors we had collected overnight. They called me in, along with our customer service team, and all the department heads. My boss explained that each error took about 10 minutes to fix, and that it would take about 111 man days to clear the backlog, not even counting the errors that where still accumulating. Everyone panicked, but I asked the CEO for 4 hours to try automating some of the work before they started calling every temp agency they could find to get extra staff to fix the issue. It took me about half that time to kludge together a system to scrub email addresses for invalid characters and misspellings of common domain names, then try to find the closest match for the street address in the zipcode provided using a copy of the USPS address database that we had purchased but never implemented in production. Then I set it running and iterated through a couple of tweaks, by the time we reconvened around noon I had already successfully reprocessed about 6K failed orders with a &gt;99% success rate, leaving only a handful of really bad records to either manually work or cancel. By the next morning we had finished processing all of the backlog and where able to keep up with new errors. I was invited into the CEOs office to meet the CEO of the client to be thanked for my effort by both. After that day I was officially put in charge of error processing automation and told that I had complete freedom to come and go as I pleased as long as I maintained the scripts and monitored the process for problems. So I spent the next six months making occasional improvements, verifying that the queue wasn't growing to big, and getting paid a sr. sysadmins salary to take long lunches, and see movies with my friends. 
We are all adults. We don't need to be limited. Good programmers understand that _methods are pretty private and __methods are really private. Sure, we can call them, but then we have to accept the consequences. 
I'm fairly certain that this is outside of the scope of win32api. A bit of googling turned up this [MSDN page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn889934\(v=vs.85\).aspx), which seems to illustrate what you are trying to accomplish (N.B. some of it is specific to Windows 10).

 &gt;The thing I made the most money on, and did over the summer until Stubhub told me I can't do anymore, is sell GA tickets weeks before the events and fulfill closer to game time with the hope that the price drops. Could you go into detail a bit more? I'm not sure what GA tickets are.. but do you mean you were selling tickets before you bought them?
I went for the VS Code as almost everyone recommended it and I downloaded pylint as well, however, all of my imports are marked as errors. Any ideas what I am doing wront?
This isn't how I started, but the first non-trivial thing I did in python. I got into python around python 1.5 or so. I had some experience at that point, but I wasn't sure about python and needed to play around with it a bit. My story is [here](https://github.com/rzzzwilson/Random-Stuff/wiki/puzzle-solver). The code [is here](https://github.com/rzzzwilson/Random-Stuff/tree/master/solver). After this I was a python convert, as something that had defeated me in C went together quite quickly and was more ambitious than the C version.

more of these:)
You'd need to install PyPDF2 using pip to count pages, but this will find all the files and count size in bytes: import os from collections import Counter PATH = os.getcwd() FILETYPES = {".pdf"} def main(): totals = Counter(count=0, size=0) for root, _, files in os.walk(PATH): for f in files: if (os.path.splitext(f)[1] or "").lower() in FILETYPES: path = os.path.join(root, f) size = os.path.getsize(path) totals["count"] += 1 totals["size"] += size print(path) print(totals) if __name__ == "__main__": main() You'd need to run that from within the directory you want to search, or change PATH to the absolute path to that directory. Once you've got PyPDF2 installed you can get the page count like so: PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(path).numPages I'll leave it to you to add that to the code above.
I am working on something like that, but it's still a very primitive draft
Turns out I was wrong -- pywin32 does indeed have definitions for these COM classes. Here's some code to get it working: import pythoncom from win32com.shell import shell mgr = pythoncom.CoCreateInstance(shell.CLSID_KnownFolderManager, None, pythoncom.CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER, shell.IID_IKnownFolderManager) # Generate a GUID, e.g: FOLDERID_Example = '{3e186988-242f-4566-a87d-53cefca8244c}' FOLDERID_LocalAppData = '{F1B32785-6FBA-4FCF-9D55-7B8E7F157091}' CATEGORY_VIRTUAL = 1 CATEGORY_FIXED = 2 CATEGORY_COMMON = 3 CATEGORY_PERUSER= 4 definition = { 'Category': CATEGORY_PERUSER, 'Name': 'Example', 'Description': 'description', 'Parent': FOLDERID_LocalAppData, 'Tooltip': None, 'LocalizedName': None, 'Icon': '%SystemRoot%\\system32\\imageres.dll,-115', 'Security': None, 'Attributes': -1, 'Flags': 0, 'Type': '{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}', 'RelativePath': r'C:\Users', 'ParsingName': '' } mgr.RegisterFolder(FOLDERID_Example, definition) for id in mgr.GetFolderIds(): folder = mgr.GetFolder(id) definition = folder.GetFolderDefinition() if definition['Name'] == 'Example': print('Successfully registered folder') break # mgr.UnregisterFolder(FOLDERID_Example) That just registers the folder though. Still need to figure out how to get it to show up in the Explorer navigation pane.

You can definitely write a blockchain in Python if you want. If you want to work on an existing blockchain like Bitcoin or Ethereum, you probably want to contribute to the official clients, and thus use the language they're developed in (C++ for Bitcoin, and I believe Rust for Ethereum).
If it's quaranteed that the sublists only contain strings, and that the sublists don't contain further sublists, this works quite well: new_list = [", ".join(sublist) for sublist in lists]
Thanks. I dont know yet what i am going to do i think etherium can be really helpful for building a startup from my project.i am aiming for that.
So do you want to make your own token for Ethereum? If so, Python won't help you - Ethereum uses a custom programming language called [Solidity](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
This is not passive income, this is just working.
Great read. I’m an avid R user although I sometimes mess with Python. I wish Python had an R Studio like IDE. I use Spyder but it feels like driving a cheap car compared to R Studio and Jupyter notebooks are not as smooth to work with. Another thing that bugs me is constantly having to call the package you’re using such as .pd for example. 
PyCharm? Also for your second point : import alib alib.afunction(some_data) If you don't want to mention again just do : from alib import * #Or: from alib import afunction afunction(some_data)

Thanks buddy for this suggestion
I tried PyCharm initially but it was a bit slow to start up and run the code. Might have been my desktop although I don’t have the same issues with Spyder. There are many things that I can do in R studio that I couldn’t do in PyCharm when I tried using it. For example, in R Studio I can view imported data sets in excel like tables that can be sorted and filtered on their own window, I can generate interactive markdown documents by clicking one button, view all the plots without having new independent windows pop up every-time the code is run, run individual lines of code, and a few other things. The Spyder IDE is close but not quite there. Python has a lot of strengths and is far more diverse than R which is why I’m making an effort to learn it, but for most of the data related work that I do, I just find R + R studio to be faster at getting it done. Also, thanks for the tip about package importing. 
Interesting!
"'Merica! Love it or leave it!" 
Jupyter notebooks would be able to do anything that rmarkdown can do. 
Lists have an "extend" method that would make this simpler
If you think of a dictionary as a, well, *a dictionary* (to look up word meanings), when you say that the word *egg* is in the dictionary is because is defined there, not because it happens to be in the definition of a different word. This is, you are saying that *egg* is contained in the keys of the dict. To me, Python is highly readable and usually non ambiguous. I am sure that there are counter examples, but dicts, being so important in the language, are not one of those. 
For a one-line solution, you could use itertools.chain
I think it makes it easier for people to find the official repo of the project and contribute. If they wish.
I was working on an text based MMO using twitter, replace twitter with HTTP and the engine design is almost the same get request get contect (player data) read actin from request do steps required to fufile request send back reply fairly simple event loop, the hardest part is deciding how you want to encode things and where to store the data more than happy to answer questions, my code is at http://blitz.works/epic/epic-tweet/ keep in mind that it was somewhat an experiment in kafka and scaling out to multiple machines turns out twitter is pretty hostile to this type of application
Not Python but you could probably look at [Mozilla's BrowserQuest demo](https://github.com/mozilla/BrowserQuest) to get some ideas.
i did like 20 times before it installed correctly no idea why though. all good now
Same thing happens to me if I use the standard launch icons. If you are using python virtual environments run “code” from the terminal after you activate your virtual environment so it picks up the right paths. Like: $ cd myproject $ . venv/bin/activate $ code
Thank you, I´ll head there right away!
Thanks for contributing on what worked for you. I really appreciate it.
Thanks for your feedback. 
Probably. This subreddit is more for news and discussion about Python, that one is for how to do things.
Thanks for the feedback. I learned Python the hard way, I even almost gave up. I didn't know of where to get help where am stuck. Worse of all, the books I came across was crap. Until I joined a Whatsapp Python free training group, that's where I got my bearings in Python. I hope a noob won't learn the hard way like me. 
Thanks for the feedback. I read the rules before sharing the post. If i break any, please I would love if you could outline them.
Please next time put the link to the article. I had to take my time looking for the articles in the individuals blog.
Check out [JupyterLab](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1920/1*NLqMKEckc7U70j-5YNpk0A.png) too. It's a smoother, more integrated data science IDE that incorporates notebooks as a component.
I just came across this post and I loved it. Keep up the good work
my b, misread the title
I've written [Tale](http://tale.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) which can run in an online, multiplayer mode (like MUDs from the old days, but accessed via a web brower). It's 100% text based though and from a quick look, Kingdom of Loathing also contains some graphics... 
Actually I misread the title. You did make money. 
oh yea, damn lol. you made me misread the title after you misread the title
&gt; from alib import * Errrr, that’s really an antipattern in many, many cases
Yes of course one should be careful using it, just like using namespace std In C++. It's good that you mention it though
I also had same problem with you when I was using Pycharm. For now am using spyder.
thanks for this! Looks like this is better suited to our needs than Celery. Even if not as spread and battle tested, it looks very promising!
The attitude of "it's not the code that's unclear and/or ambiguous, it's you who is stupid" is a dangerous one. It's more or less what killed the entire perl language and community. The remaining "genuises" who understood all of the poor syntax and ambiguous perl code were left scratching their head wondering what went wrong. It's fortunate that the python community was somewhat resistant to that attitude. No, my coworkers are no idiots.
I tried it. It's like going back to the initial R Studio release and thinking that it's better than nothing. You're right it's basically R Studio, but with five years of development missing.
Django would give you lots of stuff for free: an account system, ORM over your database, the admin interface.
Few people use rmarkdown. I pretty much only use it when I need to generate a word doc.
For being the future, too often feels like a step backwards. Everything feels tacked on. Plotting is awkward. But this is what people are using, so here I am. Let's hope a better future comes along.

General admission = GA. This way, it was easy to fulfill orders since there's a larger pool of tickets than selling individual seats. But yeah, I was essentially shorting the ticket market. And since we know prices mostly drop as it gets closer to gameday(at least for sporting events. Music is different I believe), it's really a huge opportunity.
I’m a neuroscientist trying to become better at programming for future projects I will work on e.g. visualizing data, statistics, creating experiments etc. Currently im reading books and am practicing with different mathematical libraries (Pygal). So far I love python 🐍!
Yup, no worries!
Kind of true, but also kind of the reverse. Python is a general-purpose programming language: it's just as good for a bunch of different things, it just depends on the libraries available. It's unfortunate that matplotlib, which started as merely a clone of matlab's plotting library and so suffers from many of the same flaws, is the most fully-featured library available. There is a clone of ggplot2 in the works. R, on the other hand, always had plotting as a first-class objective, because it's a stats package. However, it means that a bunch of other 'core' programming features are literally tacked onto the end, and python has a much more rational way of doing them.
&gt;Another thing that bugs me is constantly having to call the package you’re using such as pd. This is a feature, not a bug. If you're only importing a couple of things from a library, you can do from pandas import DataFrame from math import sin, cos df = DataFrame(...) If you're using lots of things from a library, you want to be explicit about where you're getting them from (making the code more readable, and less likely to get naming clashes, which means you can use more generic and descriptive names in your libraries).
Thanks mate
If you are an asteroid then yes
Hi there, thanks a lot!! So that is just at one time step and I have a server running which updates it daily. Everything is calculated using actual orbital mechanics. I have put up another animation on the Python subreddit a while ago which had dynamic locations of the more major bodies in the solar system.
Did you install a Python extension? https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python
Sun is overrated 
I know I did it in a rush
No worries, I used it as an opportunity to see if I could make that on my phone. Termux is awesome.
[I made an offline one recently](https://github.com/crawsome/PyRPG_Mini) It's all commented if you want to check out the code. I want to put it in a django app, but I'm debating going the extra mile and making a real UI instead. 
Yeah, the simplest thing we've made that's saved us lots of time and energy was replacing unities networking as it cost about 99$ per 100 users. Our game we are working on uses, Python for the matchmaking service and authentication. We also saved about 2 hours of labour when publishing builds too because we have python invoke, build and upload our game to our private server, which is awesome. It even automates signing the executables. I recommend everyone get their hands on buildbot, and never make yourself stuck with a vendor library, which they try and make you use: unless it's free and tested. 
That's pretty awesome. How are (or how did) you use python to buy the tickets? Or were you just using python to scrape for prices? Also how were you sure you were able to buy the tickets at a later date? (This isn't really a thing I think I'd be good at, I'm just curious)
Ask for recommendations on a spell check package too.
I automate finding tickets and then send myself an email with links to actually buy the tickets. I haven't found any APIs that let you programmatically buy tickets. I can buy at a later date because Stubhub allows you to upload tickets at a later date, so I sell, wait some time for tickets to drop, then buy and fulfill the orders. Since GA tickets are almost always available, I'm able to fulfill 100% of orders, and 95% of them are fulfilled at a lower price
[removed]
Yeah I have had similar results in the past. Not sure why.
Those are really neat, thanks!
If you could help you'd be a life saver. What's the best way to communicate with you.
There’s a folder property to make it show up in the sidebar. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd391662(v=vs.85).aspx
Flask + sqlite is all that's required to build something like KoL.
Yeah, tried adding a `System.IsPinnedToNameSpaceTree` `DWORD` with value `1` to all of these keys: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\CLSID\{3E186988-242F-4566-A87D-53CEFCA8244C} HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{3E186988-242F-4566-A87D-53CEFCA8244C} HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FolderDescriptions\{3E186988-242F-4566-A87D-53CEFCA8244C} ... but none of those appear to have any effect.
Explorer likely needs to reload for settings to take effect. Try calling `SendMessage` with `HWND_BROADCAST` and `WM_SETTINGCHANGE` arguments. Alternatively, you could kill explorer.exe and restart it for the sake of testing. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms725497(v=vs.85).aspx
You’re getting downvoted, but when it takes teams of actual legitimate geniuses at funds like renaissance and two sigma to consistently beat the market, it’s like trying to fly a hang glider through the sun and out the other side. 
Rodeo is arguably worse than Spyder, far fewer options and aside from the layout doesn't really get you much closer to RStudio. 
&gt;...now in Python dictionaries maintain order. Meaning, dicts are now OrderedDicts (sort of). I think it's worth mentioning that's not a feature. So `OrderedDict` is still necessary because `dict`s may not always keep their order in later versions of Python. 
 Restarted Explorer and Windows, no dice. I suspect I'm missing some properties in the `CLSID\...` registry keys -- I just stubbed those out thinking it would grab the stuff from my `RegisterFolder` call. This [SuperUser answer](https://superuser.com/questions/883424/how-to-add-google-drive-to-the-windows-explorer-sidebar/971917) has a working example though, might try replicating that.
I recently dove into Python after being an R user for 3 years. My takeaways so far: * Tossing data around feels a lot more rigid than in R. "Hmmm, will this output a list, numpy array, series, or single column dataframe?" Versus just assuming I'll get some list/vector like datatype and be able to jam that where ever I need. Will probably get better with experience. * The verbosity is annoying to me. I'm used to data.table, where it's really easy to chain operations and do filter/mutate/group by in a single line of code. Boolean mask syntax like df[df['col1'] &gt; 5] gets to be too much. * I've noticed that pandas has more stuff built in, but never quite replicates 100% of the functionality of R + packages. * I much prefer row/colnames to index functionality in pandas. I've come around to see multi-indexes as useful, but only for specific use cases. Most of the time I end up tacking a ".reset_index()" to the end of functions. * Plotting is obviously awful compared to ggplot2. * Spyder is not as good as RStudio. * Conda virtual envs are a far superior way to manage package versioning than anything R has. Basically I've rediscovered the conventional wisdom that python is better for anything headed to production, but R is better for pure data manipulation or anything ad hoc. 
Are you on Linux? Which distro/version? Windows? Writing Python code in Windows isn’t my forte but I have *Learning Python* on my desk if you need me to walk you through it. &gt; I had pip install pyperclip. What command did you use to install? If on Linux, did you just do something like `pip install —user pylerclip`? What command did you use? &gt; I don't understand it that much. So basically I am kind of confused as to if I need to be able to find paths to those things ( I tried to find them and I can't though.) Are you working interactively and manually `import`ing? Are you unable to import in a file? &gt; I recently have looked into maybe getting Flask installed also but I have to do something with a virtual environment ( I think) and it seems to be similar to installing other things. People will disagree with this, but I don’t think someone just learning Python needs to worry about environments just yet. &gt; Also I have both versions of Python, should I install everything on both versions to keep them as similar to each other as far as libraries and such go in case I need to ever use both versions for something. What do you recommend? I try to stick to using `pip3` unless I need something that works (best) in 2.X but it depends on your situation. I’ve never had a problem, but your use case may be different. 
&gt; If my app were to scale up to hundreds of requests each second, will this method work or be a bottleneck? You'll want to look into connection pooling. 
Linux is awesome, definitely I don't regret learning it. I'm making mistakes, for example when I'm analyzing the complexity of an algorithm, I'm not very sure about it. I was in the graduation the last time that I did this type of exercise. But when I'm writing, I also don't feel comfortable coding in front of someone, I still have works to do over kwargs and yield, because I'm not using it at all.
I guess it depends on what you want. I haven't used Spyder but what I like about rodeo is the command+enter for running scripts line by line. It has the same feel as rstudio in that regard
True, but that assumes that they came across the project from PyPI in the first place. In my experience, that's almost never how it's done. Usually you find the documentation website or the Github (with docs) of a project first, and only then install it from PyPI. And in that case, you already have links to the source repo (either directly, or via the documentation website).
Windows version python -m pip install pyperclip is how I installed pyperclip and it went on python 2.X when I typed in py3 -m pip install pyperclip it was installed on python 3.X https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJLj6fWfw6k at about the 4 minute 30 second mark is where I got confused on this and he started doing things that I have seen before but don't quite understand completely yet like typing cd in the cmd prompt 
I don't know KoL but a text based MMORPG server software would be [PennMUSH](http://www.pennmush.org/). It has been around for decades and still sees [development](https://github.com/pennmush/pennmush) activity
If you want to thank me, don't waste anyone else's time by passing off beginners as experts.
I use VSCode for editing, debugging and git (some extensions are gold), alongside Spyder for it's interactive python shell
To address verbosity, use df.query() and because of OOP, you can do method chaining in pandas. If column names doesn't have space in them, you can reference df.column_name instead of df[column_name].

&gt; like typing cd in the cmd prompt Ah, gotcha. 'cd' is a shell command to change directories. With that [change directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cd_(command\)) command, he's essentially saying "go to Python 3.5's full installation path and then enter the Scripts directory". On the next terminal line, he's then in the Scripts directory so the command prompt can see the pip executable. His next command executes 'pip.exe'. Also, did 'python -m pip install pyperclip' actually for you? I know that's a Linux-friendly command, but unless you changed your shell's default path information, I don't think it'll work. You should change directories to the install location's Scripts directory, and *then* run `pip.exe` like he did.

I'd recommend "Learn Python the Hard Way"
Thanks for the reccomendation. I just looked it up and looks like a good book. Going to do some research for a PDF version of it. I like the name of it lol. Learn python the hard way. Makes me very interested. 
Best of luck!
I'd also recommend LPTHW, that is where I started. And "Automate the Boring Stuff With Python". There are a lot of links on the right sidebar that would help, like the Python Docs. 
Thank you for the info, Much appreciated. 
There's a number of people on `python-dev` right now trying to change it so that it's ordered until an element is removed. That in turn removes a lot of the benefits of being able to `.pop()` from `kwargs` in a decorator or a C-api call for example. Personally I think it will stay the way it is.
You can do that with Spyder or almost any editor with IDE like aspects.
"If you can get it to return kbs/gbs as well, bonus points. Either way, there will be at least the prize of my utmost gratitude and admiration!!!" Who's a good boy!? You are! You're a good boy! Yes you areeee. Bonus treats for you for solving the thing I should and could solve myself with 5 minutes of google! Yes you areeeee!
And that's why they introduced ridges on the edges of coins.

search for anaconda navigator. That is the GUI launcher.
This type of thing would also mean it would be trivial to implement sane multithreaded memory semantics on top of multiple interpreters. Kind of like what Clojure has for example. I do think this is where we’re going though, it’s just very slow going. 
Does mininet support those features?
To find the paths of local packages you can use import site site.getsitepackages() Source [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/122327/how-do-i-find-the-location-of-my-python-site-packages-directory) ^^heh I'd recommend [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) for managing virtual environments. Since you're on windows your OS doesn't depend on python, so you probably won't break anything by pip installing packages directly. However, I think you should get used to using a new virtual environment for each project early on because you'll definitely need it later. For example, say you start a project with a large number of requirements. If you use a virtual environment: 1. You can use ```pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt``` to export all your dependencies to a text file. Then if anyone wants to run your project all they need is ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` and they have all the packages they need. 2. Your project may need pyperclip v1.0, but another project you're working on needs v2.0. If you have a virtual environment for each project, you can have both versions, one in each env. Without virtual environments, you'll have to pick one.
Ad 1) how is this an issue? In my (very little tbh) experience, you can implicitly cast almost anything, e.g df[„column“]=some_list Ad 3) like what? I have almost zero experience with R Ad 5) what are you using? I personally love matplotlib. I always thought it did everything 
```return``` returns the a value from a function. e.g. def do_something(): result = 1 + 2 def return_something(): result = 1 + 2 return result a = do_something() b = return_something() - &gt;&gt; print(a) None &gt;&gt; print(b) 3 
The latest python puts "py.exe" in C:\Windows, which is already in the path. 
`g` doesn’t persist across requests so you’re going to get new connection for each one. You want to use a connection pool that’s bound to your app. How are you connecting to your database? Are you using SQLAlchemy? Flask-SQLAlchemy allows you to control the pool through its configuration. 
This is a post better suited to https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/ I'm not familiar with mysql though for postgresql I just call pg_dump / pg_restore application through system. import system cmd = ''.join(['PGPASSWORD="{password}" {pg_restore}'.format(pg_restore=PG_RESTORE, password=PASSWORD_94), ' --no-owner --host={host} --port={port} --username={username} ' '--dbname={dbname} --clean -n public {file_name} ' '--jobs=4'.format(host=SERVER_94, username=LOGIN_94, dbname=new_name, file_name=file_name, port=PORT)]) print(cmd) system(cmd)
Yeah R really needs to sort out namespaces, it's getting pretty silly when popular packages are stomping over the standard library functions (looking at you dplyr), and breaking other user's code.
1. It's not a huge issue but a good example is if I want to compare a series to a single value from another series, I have to access that value directly using .values instead of it just doing a direct comparison. It will give a type error otherwise. And like I said part of this is just unfamiliarity. 3. I can't think of a good example off the top of my head but perhaps date functionality. Dates are "built in" to base python, numpy, and pandas but in semi-overlapping ways that are somewhat confusing. When I use dates in R I just load lubridate and forget about it. 5. Some combination of matplotlib and seaborn. Its the use case in between "simple scatterplot" and "totally custom plot" where I think ggplot2 excels. Easier to piece stuff together with the grammer of graphics approach.
I think mysqldump is what you're looking for https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysqldump.html
I was under the impression using .query() had a performance hit compared to explicitly constructing masks?
can't you replace return with print(result)
2) dates are actually a pretty good example tbf. Just had an issue with numpy dates that can for whatever reason not be implicitly casted to datetime dates. This is anyway a thing i don’t understand: numpy does their own thing for many datatypes. I know, they argue about performance but why not implement it in the core? Seems annoying to me
This is the reason. There can only be one version of `python` found on the path, but you can have several different versions installed. Which one you'd get is hard to guess (for a while it used to be the most recently installed version). Using `py.exe` instead lets you configure which version gets run. You can set defaults, for if you just run `py.exe` without extra arguments, or you can do things like `py -3.5 myscript_that_requires_python35_exactly.py`. py.exe also understands Unix-style shebang lines, and will try to get you the right interpreter even though `/usr/bin/python` doesn't exist on Windows.

I'm okay with helping you with this homework assignment, but make it easier to read. 
I have a bad repetitive strain injury in my right arm. I used pygame and a mouse emulation library to take a game controller and make it into a scrolling mouse-wheel controller - which allows me to read anything online without using the mouse or scroll wheel. This takes some of the strain off my right arm and reduces my inflammation and pain level. This is recent, and I'm an experienced programmer - but it shows some of the value in learning a bit of programming. The program was, in case you're wondering, just over 100 lines - mostly copypasta from the pygame docs.
You don’t always want to print. For example, you may want to save to a file. Good software design is about separating programs into bits that do just one thing. So for example you might have a square root function that calculates a square root, then pass that to another function that saves it to disk. Using functions also means you don’t need to copy paste as much. Just call tour function multiple times. 
Yes, I'm using sqlalchemy in some apps, but use individual drivers in some others. So, I want a generic solution to the connection persistence problem, not specific to sqlalchemy. Do you know of any good example code of connection pooling in flask?
Python Crash Course
If you need a 3D engine, you could give Panda3D a shot. These days it is on the Python Package Index and can be easily installed with pip: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Panda3D/1.9.4
What if you have a function where you want to use the result in another calculation, but not display that intermediate result on screen ? Return and print aren't the same. What might be causing confusion is thatadd when you are in the python console (the one with the &gt;&gt;&gt; prompt), and call a function then the value that is returned is printed. What you are seeing here is the behavior of python console - if you call a function and it returns a value, and you don't assign the value to a variable, then the value is displayed. &gt;&gt;&gt; def add(a,b): .... return a + b &gt;&gt;&gt; add(1,2) 3 &gt;&gt;&gt; result = add(2,4) &gt;&gt;&gt; You will notice that the first call result in the returned value being displayed, but the second call doesn't display the returned value.
In this case yes.. but what if you didn't just want to print something? Functions can do a whole lot more
Print is print on screen. Return is the "answer" of a function (which can be printed or not)
Print causes text IO while return changes the control flow of a program, note that the next statement to be run after a print statement is the next one in the block while the next statement to be run after a return statement is in a different block, the one that made the call in this block.
It did work because I used the copy/paste. I just am not understanding how he did it and I would like to figure out how and why he did it the way he did what he did. Is it possible change what I did after I did it the way I did and have it like his setup?
Sorry is it a little easier now?
I would encourage you to use SQLAlchemy’s connection pool when possible. It doesn’t make sense to ignore it because unrelated applications don’t have access to it. I’d also encourage you to introduce SQLAlchemy into other projects; doing so will make interacting with the database more consistent, which sounds like a concern. Keeping the connecting during the life of a request, like in that page from the docs, is much better than making a new connection each time you need one, but still more overhead than using a pool. psycopg2 includes a [pool](http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/pool.html) that you can use. Connection pools aren’t covered by the [DB API](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/) so other drivers may not provide them. To integrate the pool into Flask, you’ll want to use something that survives requests; a module-level variable (like an extension) or an attribute of your application should be sufficient. I still say you’re better off letting SQLAlchemy manage your connections for you though. 
Looks helpful will check it out. 
Maybe something like this? def add_tables(*tables): return [[sum(col) for col in zip(*rows)] for rows in zip(*tables)] if __name__ == '__main__': assert add_tables( [[2, 3, 5], [7, 9, 11]], [[13, 17, 19], [23, 29, 31]] ) == [[15, 20, 24], [30, 38, 42]] assert add_tables( [[1, 8], [2, 7], [3, 6], [4, 5]], [[9, 16], [10, 15], [11, 14], [12, 13]] ) == [[10, 24], [12, 22], [14, 20], [16, 18]] 
&gt; site.getsitepackages() BTW; this returns a list a bit shorter than `sys.path`; it leaves out `.` and the standard library.

That might explain why I see Python2.7 in the path and Python3.6 is somewhere else. It would be cool to set Python3.6 as default and have it on the path though. Need to see how to do that. 
Check out [the docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#python-launcher-for-windows), which describe how to set up a `py.ini` file to make defaults however you want them. You may also be able to do the setup from your script, by adding an appropriate shebang line.
Not sure it works 
The place to make this case is: https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-ideas It would probably be timely because there's currently a discussion on `python-dev` about how they broke some stuff in 3.7 on embedding interpreters and how to go about fixing it. 
not pycharm (or at least not that I know). Anyways - this isn't really the point. OP asked &gt; I wish Python had an R Studio like IDE That's Rodeo
&gt; Not sure it works Could you be more specific? This code returns the expected output for each given input in your description. Do you have any other test cases that weren't in your description? 
My point is that Rodeo is only superficially similar to RStudio, it has a much smaller feature set. Is Ctrl+Enter to run highlighted really not in pycharm? In my experience that's a universal feature for any IDE supporting a scripting language.
Sorry about the downvotes but maybe you should read the text in the installer an click whatever checkbox you need instead of mindlessly hitting the "next" button. Just sayin'
Thanks for the detailed info. Regarding: &gt; use something that survives requests; a module-level variable (like an extension) or an attribute of your application should be sufficient. Are you sure that a module level extension variable or an attribute will persist the next request? Isn't it the case that each new request will create a new instance of a module/variable? If I'm using gunicorn for hosting applications, then does gunicorn provide a feature for persistence? It would make more sense since the creation of requests is more in the control of the web server.
Ah, OK! If I wanted to adapt this to look at the locations of planets/objects at specific moments in time (historical or future), what would be the minimum that would need to be changed in the code? Or does the location data get drawn/downloaded from a data source online?
You only need `deque` for queue-based algorithms. `append` and `pop` will serve you just fine as constant operations for anything stack-based.
Github has [**71 pages**](https://github.com/search?q=language%3Apython+password+generator) of results for password generators written in Python.
What program are you using to run that code in
So you are reinventing pandas? OK: with open(self.file_name) as f: reader = csv.reader(f) # get labels of each column in list format self.col_labels = next(reader) # load the remainder of the file as a list of rows data = list(reader) # transpose into a list of columns data = zip(*data) # make the dictionary self.full_data_set = dict(zip(self.col_labels, data)) --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
We are all just negligible specks on the surface of earth. 
Pretty simple integration, but the Prometheus client for python really needs to be used in multi-process mode with most production scale web applications, since (in my experience) you aren't going to get decent performance without spreading you queries across multiple instances.
1. That doesn't look any more convenient than the standard librarie's own argparse. 2. [docopt](http://docopt.org/) is *a lot* more convenient than argparse. →I'm sticking with docopt.
It actually tends to be faster when the queries can be fully translated to `numexpr` .

Automation, automation, automation. Got a task that currently takes us about 1 engineering week, give or take. At any time two or three engineers might be tied up in various stages of the task. We're building automation around most of it to cut it down to taking ~ 3 hours (by our estimate) of which about 2h:30-2h:45 of that will be completely hands-off, leave it running in the background. Plus advantages of consistency and automated validation. 
Apparently not
What's your email?
Specifically a default ordered dictionary is an implementation decision with CPython 3.6 It's not part of the specification so may change or not be consistent with other interpreters. One should still use OrderedDict to signify the order is important regardless of what the behavior of dict is till it's part of the specification.
Thanks! I'll check it out.

You could [hash it](http://www.pythoncentral.io/hashing-strings-with-python/), then compare the hashes.
So how would one store a request.get html as a hash/dictionary? Sorry i been very confused trying to solve this. 
The default random number generator used in Python is predictable. Try https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.SystemRandom instead.
Are you trying to compare the object or the html?
Save the new web page using urllib with a unique name web_page(1).html and then hash it with hashlib and every time you save it again add 1 so you don't overwrite and can compare files.
Sorry still new but isnt everything in python an object? The def will request the html then BS will parse it. 
I will look into this for sure. That was originally my first idea, however, not sure if it will be faster to a method which doesn't need any downloading as this html/xml file can be quite extensive 
I've been looking forward to [this](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0554/) for quite a while. It's been pushed back a couple of versions, but seems likely to be complete at some point. Seems to be what you're asking for? I wouldn't say stackless was killed. [greenlet](https://greenlet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) spun off the most useful bit as a library, then the rest no longer seemed to be worth pursuing.
You may be interested in a library called Gooey that automatically adds a simple GUI to command line programs, by generating a window based on the arguments passed to main. https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey
Modules are imported once and then cached in `sys.modules`. You can confirm this by calling `print` in a module and then making multiple requests to your server. $ cat module.py print('importing module') $ python app.py importing module * Running on .... No matter how many requests you make, that line won't print again. You'll see the same behavior if you use gunicorn instead. If you configure gunicorn to uses processes instead of threads (I assume this is a thing that can be done), then each process will need to import its own copy of the module. This has nothing to do with Flask or gunicorn, though. This is how Python handles imports and (where gunicorn fits in) how Python shares things between threads.
Changed, thanks for pointing that out.
subinterpreters does not seem to be the same thing. They have been [part of python C-API](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#sub-interpreter-support) since ages and this PEP simply exposes them through the stdlib to python devs. As the linked docs state: &gt; You can switch between sub-interpreters using the PyThreadState_Swap() function. Which kind of sounds like that you can only execute code for one single subinterpreter or "state" at any given time. There does not seem to be a way to execute a "SimpleString" for two different subinterpreters simultanously using e. g. threads, if that is actually what OP implied to do.
That looks so deep
So are you trying to poll a url until the response changes? In that case you could write something like: from urllib import request from time import sleep from hashlib import sha1 def get_changed_response(url): old_response_hash, response_hash = None, None while not old_response_hash or old_response_hash == response_hash: with request.urlopen(url) as r: response_bytes = r.read() old_response_hash = response_hash response_hash = response_bytes.sha1() sleep(10) # 10 second poll interval return response_bytes
Appreciate the sarcasm and agree it's not that deep, but just provides the basic foundation :). Next blog I shall cover vgg-16/19, alexnet and inception nets that will be really deep :).
Oh yeah no doubt. The down voters likely don't even have an idea what a retail investor is. There's nothing wrong with doing some modeling for fun but not only will they never find an accurate model since past performance doesn't apply to the future but as a retail investor the edge is erased with all the fees. The only way to beat equity markets is to take the other side of their trades I.e. broker, market maker, or Algo/hft. Something newer on the other hand like crypto might be a possibility like arbing/spreading exchanges but the fact that has held true for over 100 years is that when a method is publicly known I.e. When a newbie like this dude has heard about it then the strategy has long been dried up. I was doing that 10 years ago and it was about too late by then which is why I mentioned that time period.
Actually sir, that was not a sarcasm, I mean it is kinda deep to me :) But I really liked your explainations, theyre simple and clean, if my interests intersect with yours in the future, I will definitly come by your blog again, thank you for that :)

Yes. Pity they didn’t fix this in Python 3. 
Agreed. I didn't dive into that in the article, but the library does handle it: https://github.com/Bogdanp/apistar_prometheus#multiprocess-mode
We’ve built this type of thing at work. It’s a part of the package tri.declarative: RefinableObject. You could look that up but the docs aren’t there yet. 
Since you get mySQL syntax error, the query sent is somehow wrong. Try printing it out and checking what's wrong with it. My first guess would be that [LIKE does not need parentheses](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/string-comparison-functions.html)
Nice one :)
1. Agree to disagree :) Did you see it can [automatically create args](http://declarative-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest#arguments-deduction-typing-docstrings-kwargs)? 2. docopt seem to be a good idea too; can I implement "parallel" parsers with it? I mean, I have seen the [git example](https://github.com/docopt/docopt/tree/master/examples/git), but let say I need to have: test.py input --format png output --format gif How can I do it with docopt?

Wonder if his view has changed in the nearly-26 years since that post...
Pycharm is nice but I'm using Jupyter Notebook simply because I'm using the ubuntu bash for windows 10 app and I haven't figured out how to get pycharm working with it 
I'll look, thanks!
/r/learnpython Check out this library https://facebook-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
Thanks for sharing this.
The reason why is because those languages don't have properties. [To quote Raymond Hettinger](https://youtu.be/wf-BqAjZb8M?t=28m36s), core Python developer, &gt; Getters and setters are what you do when you don't have descriptors. You have to do it in those languages. If you design classes in Java and in C++, and you don't make getters and setters for your attributes, you're incompetent. You're creating code that is going to be very difficult to maintain if people start using that API and you have change access to that attribute - you won't be able to. So that is a strong rule in those languages. Does it apply in Python? ... We don't make getters and setters [...] because we can put properties in after the fact if we need to. A getter and setters is a hint that you are doing it wrong in Python.
Looks like Spyder from Anaconda.
From Anaconda prompt, run "anaconda-navigator". If that fails, run "conda install anaconda-navigator" then try again.
Would this not work? openSql("select * from Main where Title like '%{}%' ".format(the search))
Thank you so much. It seems that the zip function was the missing piece to my puzzle. Also, I looked into Pandas and it seems to meet my needs as well. Again, I appreciate the help!
&gt; *If*, and I say *if* there will ever be a mechanism whereby users can modify built-in object types, I think it will be likely a way to add new methods to built-in classes. A way to define standard operators like "+" for user-defined types (classes) is also quite feasible -- I can imagine that a class can define methods named _operator_plus, _operator_subscript, and so on. Did I just read the conceptual birth of __add__() etc.?
I like how someone downvoted you. Can't please everyone.
It's still a fun exercise to write one yourself!
 from tri.struct import Struct orig = [1,2,3] s = Struct(foo=orig) s.foo.append(4) print(orig) tri.struct also has a Cython optimized target so it’s pretty fast. 
I'm not sure exactly what this proposal does differently than the existing subinterpreters, but I don't see the "swap" limitation here. &gt; In this case, subinterpreters provide a novel concurrency model focused on isolated threads of execution. Furthermore, they present an opportunity for changes in CPython that will allow simulateous use of multiple CPU cores (currently prevented by the GIL). There is a `run` function that does what `SimpleString` does: interp = interpreters.create() def run(): interp.run('print("during")') t = threading.Thread(target=run) print('before') t.start() print('after')

If you consider it an exercise, which is completely valid, it should be posted on r/learnpython.

Yep. Although it came up later than it might not be such a great idea after all.
This message needs context. At the time “general computing language” meant something as low level as C; something that could deal with unmediated I/O and memory addresses, that could provide robust guarantees at compile time and make programs available as shared libraries to other languages, and that could provide the infrastructure and formalism necessary for the big programs of the time (operating systems, office suites, photoshop etc). Python has never been that. Even the largest Python projects today have bits in C/C++ when the going gets a bit too tough. That’s fine, and it’s consistent even with the original vision. One could argue that some of the recent additions (type hints...) go against this vision, but they are still relatively minor compared to the bulk of the language.
&gt;At the time “general computing language” meant something as low level as C This is what he said though: &gt;a GENERAL purpose high level language In 1991 high level meant more or less what it does now.
Still pretty deep for beginners! What pre-requisite reading would you recommend before being able to understand this and begin learning ML? I have an engineering background but still found it difficult to follow.
In 1991, C was high level.
I want a gold toilet and a massage. What's your point?
Modules are separate things, just use that and one repo. Will save you time and effort. 
You can’t in js. In Python you have threads. 
That’s not true at all. Js wasn’t built with async. It was bolted on after too. 
That’s what an event loop is. Same in JS. 
&gt; In 1991, C was high level. Was alive in 1991. This is not true. *Visual Basic* came out this year, for crying out loud. 
VB was very innovative for the time. And yes *very* high level, *more* high level than others.
C was the gold standard. But nobody called it a "high level language" except people who had been programming since...the 60s?
What have you tried? Looking at the docs, you should be able to use either `getdata` or `histogram` to do a quick and dirty way. Btw: it’s best to post questions in /r/learnpython
How so?
I still love it, even if it is to be used modestly. That's the kind of responsibility you have to take with high level, dynamic languages. 
I think you fundamentally don’t understand node, js and async. Node hides a lot of the plumbing from you but it’s still the same: two async functions can’t run at the same time. Because that’s just not what it is. 
This was said in the scripting era of python. Since then python 2 was introduced in 2000, this started to change drastically. You can see it with the kind of project it is commonly used for. Then python 3 confirmed even more the new direction of python as a general purpose language. 
... yeah, and what I'm using python for is definitely just prototyping. Also, no one plans on building a wall.
Just because he used it as an exercise doesn’t mean it won’t be useful to others in it’s finished form. He’s not asking for help, therefore it’s not necessary to post in learnpython 
That's just not true. @ was recently added because operator overloading *is* a great idea when used in the right circumstances.
Coursera course on machine learning by Stanford is a pretty good starting point, also edx course on learning from data.
No, in 1991 BASIC and pascal were high level.
&gt; Seems to be what you're asking for? Yes, this is it!
'$theSearch'" Maybe you have to use just one of them ' " not both 
I was getting ready to do this, but then [saw this post](https://www.reddit.com/user/cymrow). Hoping this happens soon!
See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/7fg3t1/embedded_feature_request_can_we_stop_always/dqcjnoj/). The PEP is still draft status, but I have to believe this gets approved for 3.7. Too useful.
Lots of my professors and both companies I worked at called C a high level language. It surprised me but I guess it's a thing.
Yes, but owing to the way Python presently works, just because it has its own thread doesn't mean that it can run fully-independent of other threads, hence the GIL. We have to remember (and it's hard to visualize sometimes) that even seemingly innocuous changes made by one thread can affect the way the interpreter treats other threads; I think this is due to the reliance on the dict type for providing so much of Python's functionality.
https://youtu.be/OSGv2VnC0go?t=19m16s
Yes. Ask on /r/blenderpython/
Not only are there literally thousands of alternatives but amongst those alternatives are plenty that have been properly audited and tested for their reliability and security. Passwords should be taken seriously and using a random beginner level Python script from the Internet to generate your passwords is a horrible idea. Hence this will not be useful to anyone except in the context of a learning experience. Please understand I'm not hating on the guy or his effort. Like I said, making this an exercise is completely valid. It's a great exercise. It just doesn't belong here according to the self-understanding of this sub.
Perhaps for some perspective, I graduated HS around this time and had already been through about 4 or 5 languages. Except for specific performance-critical domains and maybe device drivers/kernel dev very few people in any circles in which I ran would have considered C a "high-level" language in '91. In '91 I was pre-college so those communities would have been what I'd call "business programmers" -- meaning non-academic and non-engineering-specific; the kinds of folks for whom VB was targeted and who probably had working knowledge of Pascal/Delphi etc. Perhaps another bit of respective? The most common criticisms of scripting languages in those days (PERL, Python, etc) was that interpreted languages were just too slow to be anything but a toy. So proponents of those languages spent a lot of time defending them as not being "general purpose" but oriented toward learning, quick one-off tasks, etc. The languages with what was considered acceptable performance would sometimes be called "general purpose". So, as others have mentioned, a whole lot of that quote very much relies on the parlance of the times and things are a lot different now.
The best path is just to build useful things that you or other people need and pick up what you need to know as you go. The path is fairly straightforward, it's just really, really, really long. It's hard being a noob because it takes about 8-10 years of consistent, daily practise to actually become good. Signed: somebody who isn't trying to flog you something.
Oh yah, I'm pretty familiar with it. I've written generic plugins for a couple different popular web frameworks.
I didn't even know that existed! Thank you!
I was a working programmer in that year, and had been for years. We still did a lot in assembler. C was most certainly considered a general purpose high level language. 
You haven’t quoted the value (%s) will expand to (%web%) You can fix it by adding quotes. Or, you can do things in a safer way and let `cursor.execute` handle this for you. cursor.execute(sql, (‘%’ + theSearch + ‘%’,))
A friend of mine lent me his python crash cource book that has helped me a lot! This is the book. (Just a random link i found) https://www.bookdepository.com/Python-Crash-Course-Eric-Matthes/9781593276034?redirected=true&amp;utm_medium=Google&amp;utm_campaign=Base1&amp;utm_source=UK&amp;utm_content=Python-Crash-Course&amp;selectCurrency=GBP&amp;w=AFC7AU969SHUN0A80CXSACGU&amp;pdg=kwd-104399445939:cmp-706717199:adg-38496048898:crv-162349686180:pid-9781593276034&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA6enQBRDUARIsAGs1YQikBndk2DZ-V-ZDo928ttxcnZHvSHaNLn4O07cK6kODkHtuv4pk8xcaAsmeEALw_wcB
Python Crash Course is a fast-paced, thorough introduction to Python that will have you writing programs, solving problems, and making things that work in no time. In the first half of the book, you'll learn about basic programming concepts, such as lists, dictionaries, classes, and loops, and practice writing clean and readable code with exercises for each topic. You'll also learn how to make your programs interactive and how to test your code safely before adding it to a project. In the second half of the book, you'll put your new knowledge into practice with three substantial projects: a Space Invaders-inspired arcade game, data visualizations with Python's super-handy libraries, and a simple web app you can deploy online. As you work through Python Crash Course you'll learn how to: -Use powerful Python libraries and tools, including matplotlib, NumPy, and Pygal -Make 2D games that respond to keypresses and mouse clicks, and that grow more difficult as the game progresses -Work with data to generate interactive visualizations -Create and customize Web apps and deploy them safely online -Deal with mistakes and errors so you can solve your own programming problems If you've been thinking seriously about digging into programming, Python Crash Course will get you up to speed and have you writing real programs fast. Why wait any longer? Start your engines and code! Uses Python 2 and 3
Cool. Acceptance probably hinges on how good the implementation is. That should determine if it’s 3.7 or 3.8 material. 
Depends on your context. For the assembly guys, sure. For some others already doing highER level stuff, no.
Decided to become a monthly donor today after hearing this news. Spyder has been incredibly useful for my PhD in Physics and beyond. I hope you and the team find an alternative sponsor soon. Keep up the good work!
The python documentation is very weak. I think I'm going to need to resort to Tkinter. 
In 1991 Pascal was high level, not C.
And we Pascal users laughed at C for thinking it was high level. :-)
Neither did i. I just found it, reading the sidebar on /r/blender And if you had read the sidebar on /r/python, you would have seen that this is not the right subreddit for questions.
I don’t think so. Learning programming is much more sane with Python. JavaScript has way too many stupid quirks and gotchas. It’s much better as a second language.

A blind guess would be like that: 1) convert to grayscale. 2) get a few points near the border. 3) calculate the average value. 4) determine the action to run from the value and some thresholds.
It can lead to unexpected results if you are not aware that the objects you're dealing with have overloaded it, or you don't know what the overloading exactly does.

A fair amount. The data collection python files are still ok but the location calc and visualizer would need to be overhalled 
*&gt; a great idea when used in the right circumstances.* You can apply that statement to any programming language feature. The simple fact that you had to add that caveat is a clear symptom: "when you don't shoot yourself in the foot or the thing doesn't explode under you, it's a great weapon."
Thank you so much! I've been trying to find this post for a long time now.
I'm surprised "mid-level" was never coined and popularized.
&gt;You can apply that statement to any programming language feature Exactly. Every feature can be abused. Think of operator overloading as naming, with the added benefit of better readability in longer expressions. You can name methods misleadingly and you can use operator overloading misleadingly. Why ban operator overloading while operators are allowed to exist at all? That just gives a weird special status to built in types. I'm adding BigInt, or how about float_128? WTF, I can't make `+` work for them? Why? That's just inconsistent language design.
Interesting device, BTW you can use python in Arduino with Firmata and pyfirmata
I would write separate programs for all of those. ie one program that turns on GPIO 0 for 10 seconds. Another program that checks accuweather and switches GPIO 2. Then schedule those programs using `cron`. --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
Oh. Well, reading's not my specialty
For context, Prince of Persia came out in 1989, and was entirely written in assembly language. Lots and lots of commercial stuff was still being written in assembler well into the mid-90s.
You are welcome! I stumbled across it quite accidentally while looking for old python releases. I also think it is interesting, I think this is the first recorded instance of Guido giving the etymology of Python :)
&gt; Every feature can be abused. But some features are more easily abused than others. I personally believe this is one of them, and I know I'm not alone. &gt; That just gives a weird special status to built in types. The "weird special status" is *the fact that they are builtins*. The language makes explicit guarantees about their behaviour. Custom classes make no guarantees. &gt; WTF, I can't make + work for them? Why? Because nobody should assume your types are builtins and will behave like builtins. 
Thanks for your comment! I agree with Robert here, on which I think that once a nice feature like this one was added, it seems unlikely that it will be rolled back. That's when I think the quote from Raymond about OrderedDicts comes to play.
Lots of stuff is written in assembler now, too. That doesn't make C a high-level language. "High" is relative to the "center of mass", not the lowest level. With Pascal/Modula-2, ADA, LISP/Scheme, FORTRAN, TCL, Perl, etc all being around at the time, C was *absolutely not* a high level language. Only people who were used to working in assembler (e.g. people programming since the 60s, like I said) thought so.

Thank you, ill take a look at those ebooks. I appreciate the help. 
I don't know, one of the things that I love about Python is that the builtins don't behave magically. They can be reimplemented in library code without too much difficulty. That means that there's nothing magical or mysterious about how one part of the interpreter works - Python's internal model is actually really surprisingly simple. If I write my types to look like builtins, I expect people to be able to use them like built-in, primitive objects. Sure, there are complexities here (if the performance/complexity of a particular builtin operation is too far the normal builtin values, that's going to get confusing, and I either need to change my library to be more explicit, or provide plenty of documentation), but generally, a user can use BigInts in the same way that they use any other type of number. I'd also argue that custom classes do have explicit guarantees. The Python language doesn't make them or enforce them, but any library developer that attempts to mimic a builtin type should absolutely ensure that their code has the same guarantees that the Python stdlib does - addition is a pure operation, `len()` returns a number, etc. The user can expect this, because the user must evaluate every library in the same way that they have evaluated Python to ensure that the library lives up to their required standards.
First, I don't know of anything that does this, but I wouldn't be surprised if something like it already exists. The general idea seems pretty good to me, but I wouldn't make it part of the program - instead make a separate program that records this information as it runs the program under test. This ensures separation of concerns and minimizes the potential impact of the data collection on the results.
How does debugging work? How does it link a line of JS to the equivalent line of Python?
In the two sentences following he said the lack of static typing and declarations made it suitable for small scripts only so I would say he still meant what it means today. However we've worked out how to use Python for that so his comment is now dated.
 from __future__ import keyboard ?
You can write a small class that keeps track of the pins' settings. One simple little while loop and you can check time so you can set each pin high or low. You can use the requests library to grab URLs. Just run the program in the background. I also agree this might be more visible in r/learnpython. Maybe we can get a gist started that might solve your problem.

So you're saying the app shuts down periodically and you need to persist an object? If so, why not serialize it?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection Please read before making anything. 
**SQL injection** SQL injection is a code injection technique, used to attack data-driven applications, in which nefarious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution (e.g. to dump the database contents to the attacker). SQL injection must exploit a security vulnerability in an application's software, for example, when user input is either incorrectly filtered for string literal escape characters embedded in SQL statements or user input is not strongly typed and unexpectedly executed. SQL injection is mostly known as an attack vector for websites but can be used to attack any type of SQL database. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
After skimming it, I get the feeling he appreciates/appreciated OO programming to a point, wasn't such a fan of duck typing, and wanted operator overloading and some compiler checking. So C++.
You did well. :-) 
So what kind of guarantee do you get when you have code like: a = b + c That `a` is now the sum of `b` and `c`? Or maybe it's the concatenation of them? Or maybe it is nice that it can in fact mean the vector sum of them. Instead of meaning a runtime error. 
It's an interesting thought. I suppose I just wouldn't bother with the term "high level" any more -- people've been making high level programming languages for 40-50 years and, unless otherwise noted, it's obviously not going to be a low level language.
Nobody should assume your types act like builtins. But if you make a type that acts like a built-in, then why the hell shouldn't it act like a builtin?
You can do this sort of thing with Julia. 
It's $10. From the table of contents, it certainly provides at least $10 worth of knowledge. Looks like a great starting point to me at that price.
The readability benefits outweigh the drawbacks. If the idea of adding two custom classes together makes sense, there is no reason I should have to write class1.add(class2) or custom_add(class1, class2) instead of class1 + class2. If I have to use a function, I immediately have questions about what that function is actually doing. Is it returning the added value? Is it adding the second class to a list on the first class? Very unclear. An operator overload does not give me any of those questions. It is clear what the intent is. Like most things in Python, there is nothing *preventing* an operator overload from doing something unexpected, but in practice, an unspoken covenant forms. And that is valuable, and the fact that it is possible to *break* that covenant, does not mean it is not generally a good thing.
Whoops, I quoted a bit too much, I was referring to the second part of the paragraph. You can define the "+" operator in Python too!
ty, like I said, once you get to more advanced topics you can do that by yourself. Look into objects and inheritance.
I am quite new to python. Right now I am working on a Script which collects data from a video game and then Shows the average of some stats in a diagramm. 
&gt; "High" is relative to the "center of mass", not the lowest level. Is this defined anywhere? I always went by languages needing interpreted or compiled are high level. It's definitely become a broad category in the 60 odd years since the concept emerged but that's maybe just the problem of using 60 year old categories.
I suppose mid-level would have to be a marketing term (low-/high-level language leaves kind of a binary situation) and given you're saying that your language is actually kind of difficult for humans to understand *and* computers can't run it directly it's not the best pitch. I can see every new language that comes out wants to claim that they are the most natural high level language or the most fundamental low level language and just never wanting to settle for the middle.
[removed]
What definition of 'industrial' are they using? The *compiler* we use is dongle locked and costs thousands. We're not going to be Python in there.
I've heard usages like that as well and you are right that it was used more like that back then. However: &gt; In computer science, a high-level programming language is a programming language with strong abstraction from the details of the computer. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language) That's definitely not C.
One of the mantras of Python is that programmers are consentual adults. 
I like to start with a basic calculator that let's you do simple math. You can add harder things like trig and calc as you go, and even look at adding a user interface if you're so inclined. The best projects are ones that interest you though, so try to think of something that you'd find fun to work on. 
NO! No one is allowed to change their mind ever, and if we can sniff out the slightest semblance of hypocrisy in someone we will strip it of any nuance or context and beat it over their head. Welcome to Internet.
There is a Python library that _kind of_ does this called Sumatra. Its for organizing and tracking the inputs and outputs of scientific simulations. You should check it out. It seems like you would have to write a wrapper script around your core program that outputs all the key metrics like runtime, etc. to text files, but sumatra will track all the output files, git commits, input files, etc. for you. There is also a slick web interface for browsing simulations and their outputs.
Try taking away numpy operators from machine learning people and see what happens. You'll be lynched to death.
That's true of literally every method on an object. You will get unexpected results if you don't know what it does.
That looks really good. Do you know of any examples where Panda3D has been used to make animations based on motion-capture data?
Nonsense. High level means languages like Perl, not C, which is barely above a macro assembler.
Isn't the same true of `a = b.plus(c)`? Could result in anything. Even `a = b.concat(c)` could result in anything, it's all just convention. So why not choose the most readable alternative?
Hey wait. Did you really write "Automate the Boring Stuff?"
In Haskell you can *define your own operators*.
So did Borland C++ (1991) With a very good IDE :-) 
maybe, python still sucks with a large codebase it's basically a nightmare if things gets too serious
Ya.
Fucking awesome. Thank you! That book saved me a ton of time at work and helped me get started trying to get into CS. Thank you! Seriously the excel stuff saved me at least 100hrs of tedious data entry at work.
:D
Can confirm. This book is really good! I usually recommend it to people that can program well, but are new to Python.
You may not need to get the entire page to know if it has changed since you last accessed it. The normal way to do this is to send a HTTP HEAD request to see if the response has a previously unseen last-modified header or ETag.
What /u/marein said. Names are neither super explicit. Some context is perfectly fine for deducing what's happening. If you don't know if a less-than-trivial function is working on sets or strings or numbers, the function name or doc or parameter type annotation is at fault, not its code. The common usage of `auto` in modern C++ and the common lack of type annotations within Python function bodies indicates that you can usually reason about this level of abstraction pretty well without explicit types. a = b + c in isolation, of course means “something’s added or concatenated or something”, but if you used proper variable names or we saw the context (with e.g. `b = np.ndarray(...)`, we’d easily see what’s happening. And yeah, what /u/Marein said…
I'm about halfway through it and it's definitely been worth it. I think I paid $20. At this point I've gotten good enough that I've sort of veered off the track of the course and I'm applying what I've learned to my own projects.
Well, I’m very sure that built-ins shouldn't be special. They're just convenience or basic types you expect, but there's no reason that there’s any behavior that’s exclusive to built-ins. E.g. Java’s “primitives” and “objects” are super weird and frankly perverse. Only the language defines value types (with operators working on them)? Why, my BigInt or 128-bit float or Point class needs that too! And everything you define is automatically a nullable reference? What, I don’t even…
actually, some of them are enforced, e.g. that `len()` returns an integer: In [1]: class Test: ...: def __len__(self): ...: return '5' ...: In [2]: len(Test()) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- TypeError Traceback (most recent call last) &lt;ipython-input-3-2c67619c7a42&gt; in &lt;module&gt;() ----&gt; 1 len(Test()) TypeError: 'str' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
too bad the downvotes, I wish you good luck !
My favorite was PEEK/POKE inside BASIC or ASM instead Pascal or Reflection.Emit inside C# -- its hard to make a clean distinction.
I am not aware of any Panda3D projects that have used motion capture data, but someone on the #panda3d IRC channel on freenode might know of something.
Fortunately there are a limited set of symbols that are allowed so that people can't just redefine how comments work (as far as I know). However I've really enjoyed playing with defining operators. My favourite was been |&gt;, &lt;| as map and ||&gt; and &lt;|| mmap operators. Pretty handy sometimes as they can function just like pipe in bash.
The problem is that the winner is always the last player of the game. And I used the @property before the .points so I don't need the (). Maybe my bug is in the play game section because I don't see anything wrong. Thanks for help
been a good while since I've done anything with telnet, and not with python/telnetlib, but I think you might want to write `b'\xff\xf3'`. The first char is the telnet escape sequence and the 2nd char is hte actual break request. You might need to flush or otherwise force the write to happen immediately if things are default buffered or line-buffered, not sure how telnetlib does things.
I'll give this a shot. Thanks!
[ASV](https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Will track memory and timing for you. Also has ability to add custom tracking things, although I've never personally used that part.
Context matters. If it's a String-Luke object I expect concatenation. If it's a number or otherwise countable/addable object I expect addition. If it makes no sense for the object I pick another, more sane library. As others have said - every feature can be abused - operators are not that special in this regard. If a method called "append" removes something, then it makes no sense either.
Thanks 
No problem, I just started really working with python too. My first project was a reddit bot because they're something I've always been curious about. Now I'm working on a program to fantasy draft magic the gathering tournaments. I find it really useful to work on things that hold my interest. 
I've found a lot of value working through the sample problems here: http://www.practicepython.org/ The problems are intuitive and ranked by difficulty, with subsequent lessons building on concepts introduced in previous entries. Moreover, you can look at the instructor's solution or those submitted by other students if you run into a roadblock.
Try https://github.com/kennethreitz/background Makes it almost too easy, you just tack a `@background.task` on top of the function and now it runs in the background lol. The source code is just a few lines so you can easily modify it for your needs
I swear one day I’m actually goin to do all of these tutorials on machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning instead of just bookmarking them.
Make the countdown clock a red LED. 
Better bookmark it while we wait for that day
The wire not actually connected to anything is a nice touch. What its missing: - IP octet over 255 (e.g. 482.19.701.2) - Flashing LED with a beep on each flash - Wrong wire is cut, causing timer to speed up and LED flash faster
Oh yeah, good idea.
Writing a script that outputs lines of a CSV file based on duplicates in multiple cells. Great project for a beginner like me! 
same boat as you!
I was working on something [similar](https://github.com/Almenon/AREPL) when I found out that it had already been done (albeit with a much different approach) as a plugin. It's pretty cool to see your code being evaluated in real-time, especially with a GUI like turtle. 
Sorry off topic. But do you think a beginner to python could use your book? I have taken a udemy course and made it through the first half of "python crash course"
Partially un-related(and in no-way answers your question which I think /u/shobble got right), but telnet is transmitted across the network in plain text, i.e. not-encrypted. For your use-case it may not matter, but you may think about upgrading to SSH, which is transmitted securely, and lots of things (even routers/switches) support SSH now. In general you want things encrypted even across internal networks, to help keep bad people out. Python also has an SSH library, so you can still manage things. Around automation, there are things like expect (and the python pyexpect module) to things like ansible and salt that are built around automation. Again, not trying to say you are doing it wrong, as for your use-case it may not matter, and you may be needing to do stuff at a low level that tools like expect or ansible won't work out for you.
unfortunately, that did not work. Still trying... 
(that IP info is actual on my internal network, I suppose I could fake it , Hollywood would) Think I may add in a small piezo speaker and LED.. may not be out of my realm, the last one I may be able to implement with my spaghetti code :-)
Thanks a lot!! Glad to hear Spyder has been useful for you and that you want to support its future development.
I'm not the Author, but yes. It is often recommended as a book for people starting with Python.
Normally SSH would be the better option, but in this case it is not. This is in a lab environment doing device testing through a terminal server. Security is not of any concern in this case. 
My Borland Turbo C++ manual described itself as a high-level language. Assembly was low-level. 
Have you tried doing an online course ?
But you could make millions by training a grid to recognize pictures of cats!
so, a qiuck peek at the [telnetlib](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/2.7/Lib/telnetlib.py) source suggests that `thing.write()` will auto-escape the `IAC` sequence (`\xff`) by doubling it up, and it doesn't appear that there's any 'raw' way to write using the lib. You could probably do the same as the [`write()`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/2.7/Lib/telnetlib.py#L273) method and call `telnetobj.sock.sendall(telnetlib.IAC + telnetlib.BRK)` or something though (untested)

No, not yet. I actually like books/tutorials better, but machine learning is still a side project for me. It doesn’t quite align with my job (yet), so I haven’t put in the proper time.
Sound argument.

Using Pandas will give you the flexibility down the road to use a much richer ecosystem for handling your data.
Can you do the same thing in R?
the real mone is on training a NN to scrap the internet to find topics to bookmark, like say, tutorials on ML
Homework? You may want to post what you've got so far. 
Why tho? There's no reason to build neural networks from scratch. Even for the learning experience your better off training from well written libraries and examining results. Plus you actually get useful coding experience and code that way.
I recently had this issue. The default version for python is 2.7 on any device. What you need to type is “python 3.6 pip -m install [package name]”
 def solution(n): return [a for a in range(7, n + 1, 7) if a % 5 != 0] if __name__ == '__main__': assert solution(50) == [7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 49] assert solution(100) == [7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 49, 56, 63, 77, 84, 91, 98] 
try this: def divisibleCheck(n): return [x for x in range(1, n+1) if x%7==0 and x%5!=0]
- Cutting the red wire should speed up the countdown timer. Then after copious drips of sweat the WHITE wire stops the timer. - To complete the scenario you should use an ESP32 with a BLE-HID keyboard and four hands typing on them furiously before defusing at the 0.01 second mark.
It isn't necessary to check every number between 1 and `n`. You can start at 7 (no matches between 1-6) and just use a step of 7. 
To understand how it works better? I'm sure plenty of people have written factorial functions/fibonacci functions/primality testing before, even though there are for sure better implementations of those too.
The difference here is uniqueness. Sure `a=b.plus(c)` could mean anything. But once that anything is defined, it can only mean that thing and not any other thing (like concatenation, for example), i.e., it cannot be overloaded to mean different things in different contexts. It makes type inference and reasoning about the code a lot easier. But then again, this is `python` we are talking about - a language with dynamic types - so, the benefits aren't huge (from a denotational semantics point of view). Nonetheless, not allowing operator overloading is a plus in my opinion.
Wow, somehow I hadn't heard of that and it looks great. Thanks
I wish I was smarter. The possibilities with this stuff are awesome, but I seeing summations of logarithms, and when that happens I shutdown completely. 
Neural Networks would never improve if it were for those interested in understanding the foundation from which their built. 
Not what you asked - but - I think you could generate a lot of interest for the project with a few simple game examples that use Transcrypt with https://phaser.io , post a link to examples to http://www.html5gamedevs.com and you'll quadruple the number of users overnight. 
Maybe I'm just getting old, but how does using `scikit-learn ` to implement a neural network count as "from Scratch"?
Are there any shortcuts to understanding the 'syntax' of stuff like [this](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?zoom=2&amp;latex=%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7D++L%28y%2C%5Chat%7By%7D%29+%3D+-+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BN%7D+%5Csum_%7Bn+%5Cin+N%7D+%5Csum_%7Bi+%5Cin+C%7D+y_%7Bn%2Ci%7D+%5Clog%5Chat%7By%7D_%7Bn%2Ci%7D++%5Cend%7Baligned%7D++&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0)? I'm thinking shortcut in the sense as you would look at a python tutorial a shortcut in comparison to a 500 page book that dives into the depths - less information and thus harder to gain any expert knowledge, however the points with more practical implications are picked out and condensed together, leading to a quicker overall grasp within a chosen context. My math learning days were not taken as seriously as I would like now that I understand why I want to understand certain things better.
At the beginning, I was very intimidated by those symbols and more. After awhile, you get to understand them a bit more. Especially after you put everything into code and see what it does. Like most things, the more exposure you have to them the more normal it begins to look.
This is not possible, sorry
I don't think you can do this, with Python or any other language. I just tried it and wasn't very successful. Sorry!
This is practically nothing about python, and all about math... 
The original article is here and does not use scikit-learn for the actual neural network--see build_model function. http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/implementing-a-neural-network-from-scratch/ It only uses numpy.
I agree with the angle you're coming from. At the same time, at which point do we deduce something is "from scratch"? What if numpy was used? Would we call for the use of C, instead? Similarly, the author of the post did not necessarily dump the data and click a "deep network this data" button. 
Sorry, I should have pointed that out as well. I certainly agree :).

I'll bet if you google "[your mobile reddit app] sidebar" that problem will fix itself. Regardless, post in /r/learnpython and post your code. If your if statement always triggers, then you are always meeting the condition set forth in it...
Here's a sneak peek of /r/learnpython using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/top/?sort=top&amp;t=year) of the year! \#1: [90% Python in 90 minutes](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/661o5a/90_python_in_90_minutes/) \#2: [PSA: If you have a library card, you probably have access to Lynda.com, which has tons of Python courses](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/6rrsdu/psa_if_you_have_a_library_card_you_probably_have/) \#3: [MIT's Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python starts today.](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/6x3tjg/mits_introduction_to_computer_science_and/) ---- ^^I'm ^^a ^^bot, ^^beep ^^boop ^^| ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove ^^| [^^Contact ^^me](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sneakpeekbot) ^^| [^^Info](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/) ^^| [^^Opt-out](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/comments/6l7i0m/blacklist/)
The ones on coursea by Stanford are excellent.
Machine Learning, Andrew Ng, coursera.org
On Ubuntu 16.04, the `python3` package is Python 3.5. To upgrade to 3.6, you'll need to add PPAs (or use a different way to manually install 3.6). I myself would rather keep support for 3.5 than getting dozens of "How do I install Python 3.6" issues. Of course this depends on your user base, if they are experienced developers, this might be no issue.
debian stable (stretch) is shipping python 3.5.3; the next stable debian release (buster), which will ship python 3.6 or newer, is estimated to happen in 2019, and stretch will be supported until 2020. of course it depends on your target audience, of how many users you expect on stable platforms vs. devops who expect to ship their toolchain as they need it - but i, as someone who maintains production systems on python 3, appreciate not having to chase the very latest version on the servers.
downvoted for abundant use of caps lock and presenting in video form what could be said in 10 lines of text.
It's the ID-10T indicator.
I read the term mid-level regarding C in a magazine at that time IIRC. But only once. ;)
&gt; Please help as soon as possible. Everything you need to solve your problem can be found [here](http://sscce.org/). It is written for Java developers, but the same applies to Python too. If you think that's too much trouble, well, remember that you're asking a bunch of strangers who owe you nothing for a favour. If you can't be bothered to make it easy for us to help you, then you can pay professionals $150 an hour to help.
As people have mentioned , Andrew ng's course from Stanford on Coursera . It's free and if you do finish it within the course structure you can get a certificate for an amount. Wether you take a certificate or not the coursework the course will definitely help you get started
And C. Source: was around C programmers who described C as a high-level language.
&gt; C, which is barely above a macro assembler. C is lots of things. But calling it "barely" anything (unless it is "barely capable of writing correct, bug-free code *wink*) is ludicrous. And I'm not even a fan of C!
CS Student here, there are no shortcuts to gain understanding. Sure you can just run some libraries that let you run model XYZ in 5 lines but this won't help you get deeper knowledge about what actually happens.
Any "Top Best Python Books" list that includes *Learn Python the Hard Way* and excludes https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ can be safely ignored.
This is to be kept in mind especialy if OP's app is used on raspberries
Im an intermediate programmer (2 years experience). Just slowly finished [Python 3 Object Oriented Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Python-3-Object-Oriented-Programming-Second/dp/1784398780) over the course of 5 months. I highly recommend it. Finding books that bridge that gap between beginner and advanced can be difficult. This book does a wonderful job of that.
Would have loved to give it a try, but couldn't really figure out which modules are used. `np` seems to be `numpy`, `plt` maybe `matplotlib.pyplot`, though then I can't find a `plt.cm.Spectral`. What is `sklearn`, I couldn't find a `scikit-learn`?
Second this. Installing 3.6 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS is not trivial. I once went through it, it went ok, then I needed some python library which had to be recompiled, for that I needed some newer Ubuntu libraries which were not present on 16.04...
Note to people wondering about Ubuntu here. Ubuntu does an LTS release which is meant to replicate the patterns of enterprise software. If you want the latest versions of anything pick the most up to date release. Ubuntu won't change major versions of any software the could potentially break your product, that is the reason why they hold off on these sorts of things. 
Sorry for the late reply, but I’ll give you my two cents. University course work is almost entirely irrelevant, unless it’s very practical. Even then, unless you are doing strict research, everything is implemented and available open source, so for general data science jobs intimate knowledge of algorithm implementations or understanding that proof is not needed. The challenge is to gain practical experience and be able to decide which approach would work, and know how to do implement it. At the NVIDIA conference in Munich this year, the CEO said something along the lines of “data is the new source code”. This really resonates with me. For my deep learning project, the major bottleneck and challenge was gathering the data, defining what it is the data actually is in an ideal case, labelling and pre processing and then storing in a way which can be easily used by any framework. Then the only issues I faced were only ever with compiling libraries or solving runtime errors. This in itself is another kind of skill I’d class as being able to problem solve/research things and find obscure posts which contain a solution or point you in that direction.
The answer is usually yes, invariably, as you could do this in any language. The question is how much work will it take? Implementing this in C might be a bad idea in terms of cost-benefit. R probably a good idea.
That's why 'Implementing ... in python' is in the title. It's a first principles approach, good for teaching the underlying math. This is useful when using out-of-the-box machine learning libraries as you'll have a better understanding of what they're doing under the hood.
thanks for this, can i get the offline version or pdf
did you `import sklearn.datasets`?
In general I think the code is good for a beginners program. One small thing: print("Congratulations, you guessed my number") print("My number was", computer_choice) number_of_guesses = number_of_guesses - 1 print("You had", number_of_guesses, "guesses left") number_of_guesses = number_of_guesses + 1 break I would prefer: print("Congratulations, you guessed my number") print("My number was", computer_choice) print("You had", number_of_guesses - 1, "guesses left") break Less changes of variables make code less error prone and easier to reason about.
Ah I see, I only imported sklearn, thought giving the full path when calling the datasets should be enough.
There is a module called [Scapy],(http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/) that i have used for something similar. Basically i used it to populate a database of IP addresses, based on broadcast source IP.
Thanks man 
TIL about f-strings. Cool. Thanks. Regarding version support: In the runup to a recent release of my application a Python 3.4 user (using some Raspberry-Pi-like device) filed a number of issues that I wasn't seeing on Python 3.5 (mostly unicodedata version stuff). Which was awesome because it made me revisit some sloppily written code and because he was very diligent in his bug reports and eager to help test fixes. My point is just that I'm glad I did not limit my application's version support without a very good reason because well, maybe the best users tend to be those with limited options and on older systems? Just a theory.
well, i just started yesterday. First step is all it takes. neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com is what i started with. I'll take this opportunity to ask you to put in your first hours in next 24hrs and report back. :)
neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com is something you can start with. Not very difficult. he tries to explain how, it is not important that you understand those mathematics and get scared and instead focuses on logic behind those and how to think neural nets.
Build from source in a custom path. I have 3.6 on Ubuntu 14. Works fine. I use pip instead of apt for libraries.
If you plan to keep updating the code I strongly recommend you to use something like [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/) or [Etherpad](https://piratenpad.de/) and just post the read-only-links here.
Your program has a bug. Assume random.randint(1,10) will return 9 as the number you need to guess. Then do the following guesses in order: 5 7 9
I've been through it and it's generally a nice course that provides a variation of python applications, so hopefully by completing it, you actually have a small scale, but realistic experience in python.
It's not just Ubuntu 16.04. Ubuntu 14.04 is supported into April 2019. This has Python 3.4. 14.04 is significant because it's also the last Ubuntu LTS release to use Upstart so the cost of upgrading is disproportionately higher than other LTS jumps. That *may* not be a factor with your user demographic though. As previously detailed, upgrading is non-trivial but it may well be possible to **bundle Python 3.6 in with your app**. There's nothing stopping Pythong 3.6 *running* on older distros. Obviously a bit more of a headache for you though to compile all this and you should definitely take a or two to make sure the licensing allows this (I *think* it does but IANAL).
A lot enterprise distros are still on 3.5 for what that's worth. A year really is no time at all in the enterprise world and would easily be regarded as fresh. That said, most of the consumer distros from the last year have moved to it, though none of the long term support distros currently have it as far as I know. 
[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) might help. (Though this doesn't help with OP's original question, obviously.)
Will do man, my mistake ahaha (tutorials? sorry never used Git)
what do you mean? (sorry new to python)
It's a common thing for the very large packages to split them. That way it doesn't import the whole package (and consume related resources) unless you want it to. You'll see a lot of unusual import behaviour in the scientific community. Things like `import numpy as np` are completely standard in the numerical sciences, but outside of the numerical sciences everyone raises their eyebrows and goes 'what, why?'
No disrespect to anyone that's replied, but I'm with samsquamchh (TPB Reference? NICE). I'm pretty sure he's not asking for a shortcut to mastery, he's asking for some sort of abbreviated approach to gain understanding of the concept. Once that sinks in, he can choose to dig deeper as he can choose to expand his understanding as he wants to determine the suitability of other models, etc. (Apologies if you are not a 'he')
Working how to get into coding and using python as my first language.
Unfortunately, tri.struct do not support "full transparency": &gt;&gt;&gt; from tri.struct import Struct &gt;&gt;&gt; o = {"foo": [1, 2, {"bar": "baz"}]} &gt;&gt;&gt; s = Struct(o) &gt;&gt;&gt; s.foo[-1].bar Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;input&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; s.foo[-1].bar AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'bar' &gt;&gt;&gt; s.new = "new" &gt;&gt;&gt; o {'foo': [1, 2, {'bar': 'baz'}]} &gt;&gt;&gt; s Struct(foo=[1, 2, {'bar': 'baz'}], new='new') &gt;&gt;&gt;
When you have computer_choice = 9 # assume randint() will return 9 as the number you need to guess an you do the following guesses in order: 5 7 9 then you programm will print Congratulations, you guessed my number and You did not guess my number
&gt; t which point do we deduce something is "from scratch" Standard library only.
Am literally starting a new job today and will be focusing on that, but nice enthusiasm to get other people started! :) I had started on this a few months ago, but priorities changed. Looking forward to having more time for this stuff in a few months!
Sigh... *bookmarks*
Hmmm thats odd because it seems to work fine for me, what do you think the issue would be?
Hmm. Seems like the reddit code formatting broke your code.
Is this a bot? 
I'm not sure I agree. You seem to say that the meaning of `+` depends on the context while the meaning of `plus` does not. But the meaning of `b + c` is defined by the `__add__` method of the class of `b` whereas the meaning of `b.plus(c)` is defined by the `plus` method of the class of `b`. They are the same, no?
Yes, I know, but the OP question was if being 3.6-only might inconvenience someone. My opinion is that yes, it might.
I've been wanting to create something like this
Who needs bookmarks? I just keep them all open in Chrome tabs. 
check the sidebar mate, bunch of resources
That might be it? I can upload the file for you to test?

And adding time to the counter every time the camera is not on it.
ah i didnt think of that.. will do. thanks
sure does! thanks!!
Someone said Spaghetti Code?
TPB indeed! And yes, I didn't mean an actual shortcut which literally takes you from A to B in less work, B being a full grasp of linear algebra etc. I was imagining something like a math course covering the topics one needs to work through in order to understand the under the hood math of some basic neural nets for an example, assuming there are areas covered in school-style curriculums on the general topics which are more like noise in a signal to someone interested only in the deep learning related math. What seems to be implied though is that you can't do that as it would require you to still treat certain aspects of the math as a black box if you try to specialize, which by definition still doesn't get you to understanding how it works? Again, just to be clear, not a shortcut to actual understanding, but rather an idea of a shortcut based on the assumption that these areas of math can be as modular as say python modules - you don't need to learn all modules in order to understand the few you are interested in. Right now when I look at relevant mathematical notation, I might as well be looking at hieroglyphs. Something tells me that the concept is similar to how code looks like to someone who hasn't learned it. They don't need to master all corners of the language in order to understand the syntax. 
Not. Neccesay. With the correct indenting wit works properly,
I would argue that everyone building from scratch slows progress though. You don't start learning about commission engines by building one from scratch. You study well made models.
Delete the variable? On a serious note, if you looking in editor preferences I think you can switch this off, but it may stop highlighting other errors as well
I never ever visit a bookmark. I might sometimes write in the bar and tab myself into an older visited link but that's it.
This man lives dangerously
It uses sourcemaps. https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/ You translate with the -m switch to generate them. Then if you e.g. use Chrome and open the developer tools with F12, apart from .js files, you'll also see .py files. Takes some browsing through folder trees in Chrome's dev GUI to find them. If you click on a line in a .py file, Chrome will take you to the corresponding code in the .js file. You can also set breakpoints in the .py file and error reports will refer to the .py file as well. 
[deeplearning.ai](deeplearning.ai) By Andrew Ng is an excellent introduction with a good mix of math and code. [fast.ai](fast.ai) is also very good but it's more practical with less math. 
Thanks and no problem. Transcrypt itself got upvotes enough. Only to be invited to contribute to it doesn't please everyone, it seems.
I like to do this as I convince myself that I'm actually going to read them for real, literally any time now, any time
Nice - solid amount of views too so will defo check it!
I'm no Python kung-fu expert, but I'd suggest looking for a good walkthrough that speaks in a way you can relate, even if you don't understand the entire process from start to finish. If you can cross the finish line while having reviewed the code a bit, it may give you a chance to poke around at some code that at least *starts* to feel familiar, and then you can look at the suitability of each of the tools in the toolbox. Disclaimer: Just a suggestion. I haven't done any of this yet - but that's my plan, and for the same reason.

Not sure how it's not clear by this point but I have talking about strictly math all this time. Thanks though.
That's why paid secondary education is worth the money. Half the money goes to hire the personal trainers who yell at you and give you bad marks when you're wasting time.

Most of the computer science textbooks in University right now would describe C and C family languages as high level languages. It’s weird, because it wasn’t that way 5-15 years ago.

The other half is for books that you really need that one page of.
https://unsupervisedmethods.com/cheat-sheet-of-machine-learning-and-python-and-math-cheat-sheets-a4afe4e791b6 Maybe this will help... a bit?
Did OP say this is "beginner programmer" friendly? I don't disagree with any point you're making, but I think you're missing the point of this thread. A shitty analogy is like riding a bike. When you first start learning how to ride a bike, you don't give a shit about the mechanics of it, you just focus on pedaling and staying upright. Then after you've owned a bike a while you might start messing with the chain or trying to understand how the gears work. Same goes for Neural Networks. I mean if somebody posted a thread saying "How to implement a Web Framework from scratch with Python", are you going to be in there saying, "Wtf guys? Just use Django and be done with it." 
how does this compare performance wise vs Sanic or Japronto? (both are flask-like async libs offering the same idea)
I doubt the writer has read even a quarter of the books he is recommending. A Python list without Fluent Python and TDD with Python and a Django list without Two Scoops is just bad. It's like this particular site is deliberately publishing terrible articles just to piss me off.
