Headless Chrome and Splinter might do the trick. I've never installed headless Chrome in Lambda though so that might be tricky.
r/learnpython
Fair enough
I like your current ideas. I think that’s exactly the kind of topics they’d want to discuss. I wouldn’t crowd it too much for 90 minutes worth and be prepared for a healthy Q&amp;A session so maybe pare down the number of topics.

great but what made the designer to decide on not having any graphic /smh
Just use Python. Maturity + Networking effect. Using Julia instead of Python is even sillier than using Flask instead of Django.
Huh. I misread the timer. Yesterday I only thought there were 10 hours remaining. That would explain why I'm still (legally) seeding those torrents.
Second for Kivy! There's a lot to learn, but you can do a lot of basic things without delving too deep into it. 
1. [Official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/). 2. Stack Overflow. 3. [Harvard's CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/) (free courseware) ([alternate website](http://cs50.tv/2017/fall/)). The languages they cover vary by year. I can find answers to 99% of my questions / problems within five minutes by googling.
Thanks. Those are very good points. The threads limitation is a very good one. II mainly use this for menus creation to limit the extra startup time of host applications and in centralized modules used by different software where it is not possible to import the Software A Python module in Software B and vice-versa (Maya, Houdini, Katana for example) Other than that I try to be a good little Pep-8 developer. :) 
Haha I thought the same but I’m using it because I’m learning and that’s what the book I’m using recommended.
&gt; currently learning Python don't bother with any UI for now IMO
&gt; I don't expect to get sued for liability honestly. Your expectations have no effect on this.
Yeha, just got out of therapy for depression 2 months ago. I feel fetter now, but yeah, NOT a good time in my life for reason I wouldn't dream of sharing. So, fuck you very much , be on your way and piss off. The only friends you have are friends that put up with you. Or maybe they're just the same so you can be miserable people together. I got sick because I let how I treat people get to me too much, you have it opposite issue. And it's the one the world would never admit - but knows all the same the world would be a better, if not but marginally better of a place if your heart stopped the second I lift my finger off the comment button and before the post request hits the servers. &amp;#x200B; Fucking joking around about mental illness like it's some fucking joke you abhorrent , infectious persona? &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Pygubu is passable for tkinter, but is somewhat restrictive in what you can do in it. I like qtcreator and pyqt
https://kivy.org/ is pretty cool. I've mostly gone the browser based way myself though, modern js frameworks are too nice looking, but obviously not what you are after most likely.
It's also worth mentioning that PySide2 and PyQt5 are essentially drop-in replacements of one another. I had a fairly involved application that I migrated to PySide2 for licensing and that involved only: \- replacing PyQt5 with PySide2 in all the import statements \- replacing pyqtSignal with Signal in all of the signal declarations
For even faster turnaround time, you can use `PyQt5.uic.loadUiType()` to load the `design.ui` file directly. I haven't tested the difference in startup time, but I like it for having fewer steps needed to test changes. I just save from QT Designer, then reload the script.
I'm not joking around mate, you are making delusional statements and self destructive remarks. This isn't how an okay person responds to a one sentence comment promoting you to seek help. So again, all I wish for you is to get help, and I'm disabling inbox replies here. Have a good day and hope you get better.
That better-designed language won't have 130,000+ libraries available for it so no one will adopt it. It said that nowadays not being popular can itself be considered a language flaw.
Fake sympathy. And it gets lower. If I posted this on r/mentalhealth or r/depression You'd get murdered. I have a temper. Yeah, it's a flaw. You're are simply not a good person. Conversation muted . I'll forget this ever happened the second I find the hottest chick at the bar to hit on. And cabs almost there. peace &amp;#x200B;
Fact: Feedback. Being as asshole. Mutually exlusive. FUCKING gag me. lol. God that's just so....gah. I got nothing. Beyond words.
I'm very new to programming. At 46 going back to community college for Computer Science and learning as much as I can on my own. CS used C++ and the Spring semester will too, with Data Structures and Algorithms. First thing I did with Python after a couple small tutorials was to refactor my CS final exam from C++ to Python. I also have a Jekyll blog and one day as I was about to write another post the thought struck me, hey I bet I could write a Python script to automate this annoying task of creating a post file with the correct title formatting and YAML header information. That's been the ONLY thing about Jekyll that I didn't like. So I wrote my own script, not without significant googling for help obviously, but the script is 100% written by me, no copy and pasting any one else's code. I used Google for the concepts and then wrote it myself. Pretty proud of myself. As I'm very new, it's a work in progress and I plan to make it better but it works. Anyone that wants to use it, feel free or leave comments if you'd like too.

TUI or CLI? Built-in we have curses if you're on a Unix system (there's external downloads for windows) for a TUI and argparse, optparse+getopt (deprecated) for a CLI built in. People also like docopt and click over argparse, but they have weird issues when not running directly from a terminal sometimes (like if it's run via upstart or systemd). For a TUI blessed and cursed builds off curses. There's also asciimatics but I've never tried it. Personally argparse for CLI and curses or blessed for TUI is my goto.
Wish I consulted this subreddit sooner. I picked up this bundle the other day. 
I still might get it tbh
If the function that uses that imported module ever gets called, it’s going to fail anyway—just later (and perhaps less consistently) than it otherwise would. Ideally you’re testing code before pushing it onto the render farm. Barring that, it’s probably good to have it fail quickly and reliably, so you can fix it as soon as possible.
One benefit to wxPython is that it uses actual native widgets, whereas Qt implements its own widgets that emulate the look and feel of the target OS. That said, in practice Qt is close enough that most will not notice the difference.
Yup. This is one of the reasons I like wxPython. But Qt is pretty good too
Yeah. The new ttk module made it look a lot better. But the documentation is lacking so a lot of people don't know about it
You have to see my example as follow. Imagine a chrome extension done in python. Which do you consider better in a case of failure of the python code. 1. Only the extension failing when it is called. I.e.: when pressing the icon 2. Chrome entirely fail to launch 
&gt; As previously posted, You have been asking similar questions on /r/python, /r/learnpython and /r/codinghelp. From the sidebar: News about the dynamic, interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, extensible programming language Python. If you are about to ask a "how do I do this in python" question, please try r/learnpython, the Python discord, or the #python IRC channel on FreeNode. You might get some help on /r/codinghelp, but the best place for python **questions** is on /r/learnpython.
The big drawback to Qt Designer is that the code it outputs (at least in my experience) is messy and practically unreadable. When I was learning PyQt I quickly switched to writing all the code myself. Not as fast and more of a learning curve, but worth it imo.
It’s going to crash anyway as soon as it hits the missing import. Ideally you’d test it to make sure that won’t happen, which is going to be easier if the import is outside of the function call.
Yup, there's a few other weird things that I ran into switching to PySide but it all in all extremely easy.
There are some types of project for which Flask's better than Django. An example: If the project is not conventional. Django has a lot of standard components and when your project doesn't conform to those you have to do a lot of dirty hacking to make it work with Django. Flask by its "start with nothing and add what you need" just works better for that type of thing. Another example: You just want to spew in a folder and get web quickly.
And if you use the `qtpy` wrapper, you can switch between the two by only setting `os.environ['QT_API']` to either `'pyqt5'` or `'pyside2'`. 
Here's what I just finished: https://pastebin.com/3sTpR7Vp I know it's very amateurish, but I just started learning Python a week ago and it's my first programming language (unless you count Scratch I suppose). So I feel pretty proud of it. I'd love to hear suggestions for improvement; a lot of times I found myself copy-pasting sections of code and just changing a list name or something, which seems distinctly unpythonic to me.
Thanks. I'll check it out. Yeah, it is a bit of a big task. I'll have to see how it works out in practice before I decide if I want to do all of this.
I might skip Lambda and use SQS instead and keep a microservice running in AWS Fargate instead. Not sure what the best plan is at the moment. This project is only a minimum viable product, so if things have to get redesigned in the future, then that is OK.
damn, I started just a week ago and you're doing a lot more than I
tic-tac-toe is a good one. It's pretty simple to make a human-vs-human game, but it's an extra challenge to create a human-vs-computer game.
Tkinter and modern are at odds.
`djangoadmin startproject myproject` is all you need to launch a Django project, how much easier could you want?
I am very interested in ML and AI, I am learning it's concepts but needed a place to apply it. I understand what you said.Currently using VS code as a text editor and powershell on Windows for execution and other stuff.I have Linux on a better laptop but since I managed to destroy it's display ,I have to use a water down version of a good computer.
To install: `pip install requests` To use a proxy with requests: [http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#proxies](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#proxies)
Why reinvent the wheel when you can just use SET
Have this lib that embeds invoice metadata in PDFs. Maybe should switch from pypdf. https://github.com/invoice-x/factur-x-ng
Another option is using [wxPython](https://wxpython.org/) and [wxGlade](http://wxglade.sourceforge.net/).
I recommend PySide2. It has an open license unlike PyQt5 which you need to pay if you ever plan on using it commercially
Such an app would do nothing useful. 
Not truly Python, but powerful... I am using Javascript / CSS for this purpose, so [Mithril.js](https://mithril.js.org/) (drop-in replacement for React.js) and I can have the full power for CSS. An easy way to use CSS is [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). Javascript can connect to Python through API, maybe with [zerorpc](https://github.com/0rpc/zerorpc-python) or JSON-based API. When packaging to \*.exe, you'll have to PyInstaller-ify and put in Electron. Not exactly efficient as Chromium in Electron eats up some RAM.
I see a lot of new languages popping up and I’m hesitant to jump on the bandwagon because I see market over-saturation (too many new languages). I think I’d want to see a little history on a language before starting to use it. Julia seems like a decent enough language but where will the community be in 5 or 10 years? Then again, maybe it doesn’t matter. Personally, I like Python because of it’s maturity. If I need raw speed then I’ll use another well-established language that has it. Python can be made to be fast too. All that said, my choices and my paths aren’t good for everybody. There might be value in experimenting with something entirely new. It’s highly possible that I’m just getting old and cranky too. 
bought ... thank you
You use flask when you need a simple api with maybe just 2 endpoints. Or when you just need a intermediary microservice that just integrated a bunch of other thirdparty apis. Bringing big guns like Django for just two endpoints is plain stupid. You could even convert a Flask app to Sanic if your traffic increases, both are very similar.
TUI. I've reviewed many Python systems, including npyscreen and urwid... and never quite found the right fit. My goal is to make dbase style text database applications, and I'm surprised to find that a modern language like Python (and others) are lacking in TUI libraries that aren't fully roll your own. Saying curses is available is like telling a Windows person that a video driver is present, that's not a UI library. I have little reason to believe that open source hobbyist coders would recreate those tools, I despair that the ones we had in the past are lost.
Agreed with u/wikwikwik. Both Django and Flask have adequate amount of tools to have an app up and running in no time. If it makes any difference, from flask 1.x, you can run and do other administrative stuff with the \`flask\` command. However that does not give you any edge over, say, bottle or webpy (both are similar to flask).
do you have a discord by any chance? idk if you are into python game dev but I'd love to trade ideas. I've been working in Python for years so picking this stuff up isn't too hard.
&gt; The one (bad) argument that I know of to put imports within a function is to avoid circular imports. That's a *good* argument for imports within functions, for cases where you can't redesign your code to avoid circular imports. 
Ttk helps. 
The release notes are in the documentation: [https://pikepdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html](https://pikepdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html) I do release frequently because I don't like to leave people hanging if they have an open issue.
The strongest reason for putting imports inside a function is to delay the import until you know you will need it. For many modules, that's probably unnecessary (e.g. `sys` is a built-in module, so it's initialised early during interpreter startup) but if you have an expensive dependency that you only *sometimes* need, you might improve responsiveness if your code delays importing it until necessary. 
That would be a good candidate for implementation with pikepdf.
Ttk widgets look native in Windows, but ugly in Linux. Best choice for Linux is PyGObject with Glade.
Yeah, it does, I used ttk for most of my software applications on desktops and it gives Tkinter a better feel. 
Pycharm is slow in general and a resource hog compared to native apps on any platform. But more than that, there’s a lot of cognitive overhead setting up a project and tweaking things so that all of the features work as expected. For small/medium projects I don’t really want to put in the time to set it all up. It’s not really worth it. 
So as a disclaimer, I'm a huge GTK+ fan. It can be a bit awkward to set up initially, but once you've got the hang of it, it's pretty great. It can run a GUI specified in an XML file, and Glade is a UI designer that can write out the files (they're also surprisingly not bad to edit by hand). Also, GNOME Builder is a new, GTK+-powered IDE for GNOME that supports Python, and the nightly builds have a GUI designer powered by Glade. 
Hello mattip! Very good work on that by the way! The graphs on the post were made on matplotlib running on mac pypy which didn't work last year.
Suggestions and feedback are welcome.
I'm hoping this could be handled automatically by pygame, a higher level library, or even an option in pypy.
How would someone go by acquiring a commercial license from these guys. How much does it cost?
Cool
Companies don't fully test their code though, ever. If they did, bugs wouldn't exist. Especially in big or complex projects. Even if tested normally it could work, but then jimbo whowhatsit does something a little different and gets that one bad trigger that no one could predict. 
Well, I mean, come on.
The single most important reason to avoid imports within function is that it prevents your code from running in an environment with a stable known state. Best practice is to make sure that all of your dependencies are accounted for a load-time, not runtime. Imports can make radical changes to the runtime context, have their own dependencies, and introduce versioning issues from third party code. Modules and packaged are effectively singletons. Repeated imports only change your namespace. Imports should exist in the language execution environment before your code runs. Not in some arbitrary point in your code’s execution path. This is global state. It’s bad for the same reason global are bad. The same reason singletons are bad. That is, they are not intrinsically bad, but bad in the wrong context. There is a time and place for everything. The time for global state changes is load-time, not runtime. Break this rule at your peril. Python will let you, but I recommend that you reserve this particular bit of technical mayhem for the shittiest of your shit code that you have no intention of living with. Write-once and use never. It is completely doable. It’s not illegal. But it will add brittleness, code rot, and debugging hell to any code you write for systems you share with others or live with for longer than a one-off batch script...
Attempting to create a text based game engine so once released it will be a foundation for anyone to add their own stories to with a little amount of knowledge of Python.
no pygame for me, it doesnt do any flashy animation etc, its very static.. but.. it works :D
PyQt5
Since nobody has mentioned it yet, I'll just throw Flask out there. If you know the basics of web design, then it can be quicker to design a locally served flask-based website that does what you want, especially for more complex GUIs.
electron might also be a way to go if you are looking for a more desktop app route
Doesn't electron basically bundle most of the Chromium engine? It sounds like a lot of RAM overhead for a GUI. Whereas if you already have a browser open, serving HTML via Flask would have much less overhead.
I love Python2019GUI builder, it's built specifically for 2019. But actually the only problem is that there will be no support at the end of 2019 :(((((((
Is the goal to convince them to try Python for their next project, or that they will *definitely* use Python due to some management decision and need to learn a quick overview? For experienced developers they can almost certainly figure out language usage and syntax on their own. It sounds like you need more of an intro to the Python *community* more so than the language. What are the advantages of using Python and it's community? That I think would be the most interesting no matter which goal you were going for. I agree with other comment that Django is likely a better more full featured framework for a professional audience and illustrates one of the many communities in the greater Python community. I slightly hesitate on a focus on being "pythonic" because they could respond "what's wrong with doing it the C# way?". Python is object oriented and has most of the features they'd be used to, it's probably not immediately clear why pythonic code is best, so the dynamic nature (good and bad), cross platform execution, and community of many many libraries and professional tools seems like the better way to go to me if your goal is convincing them to use Python in their next project. Python is now well supported by Visual Studio and Microsoft. If that's their main platform might be good to give a shout out and maybe even some sort of demo or project walkthrough, debug a Django project or something.
Also a GTK guy here! My only issue with it is the Windows/macOS support. Started 10+ years ago to build some Ubuntu tools and just went with it for cross-platforms applications, but it takes some effort to get it going properly.
Are you sure you typed this into a python shell? sounds you used a windows-cmd. The Python prompt starts with "&gt;&gt;&gt;" not with "c:\\&gt;" &amp;#x200B; ps: please use /r/learnpython for this kind if questions
It is recommended to use list/generator comprehension over `filter` and `map`, more pythonic and faster as well. Rewriting your examples: numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,44] evens = [n for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0] squares = [n ** 2 for n in numbers]
If you are building full fledged graphical applications or simple tools PyQt is the way to go. I've written a number of applications for artists and the extendability of PyQt is wonderful. The Qt library is quite extensive featuring classes ranging from auto-completion to media players. There are extensive Model-View-Controller classes available for custom document editing or other tasks. You can even write your own OpenGL based widgets that behave well with the rest of the library. Even if you author your UI in Qt Designer it's not hard to extend the base classes to suite your needs (loading the .ui file at runtime via PyQt.uic is infinitely better than churning out a lengthy .py file everytime you modify your ui). &amp;#x200B; Yes, the more in depth usage takes some time to master but I feel like you can literally write any kind of graphical application used on a desktop in Qt. It's a professional solution.
Also it's not recommended to use `lambda` to define named function like `example1 = lambda a,b: a+b` then call `example1(1,2)`. Just use `def` for that. `lambda` is used to define anonymous functions , usually as an argument to pass to a high order function, e.g `sorted`, `itertools.accumulate` or `functools.reduce`
Deploying to WebGL and Android with the new setuptools commands is on my todo list for 1.11.
PyQt is awesome but recently i discovered Flask and now i replaced all of my apps with html design and dynamic insertion/updates on apps very easily. This made my app design jumped to another level. In addition i can easily update my apps and host them.. This may change for others since i'm not a professional developer
Failing as soon as possible and often as possible should make it easier to test and catch
This looks really cool. After playing around with some of the node frameworks for GraphQl I was really disappointed by graphene. This is much more explicit and with a more sensible API. Are there any plans to integrate Starlette as the ASGI server and move away from WSGI?

I would take some small to medium sized existing project and rewrite it in Python, then showcase both apps and give tours of the code. If they all know the existing app's code, so much the better.
The young lady is a bit hard to listen too. 
Do any of these choices support packaging as a single executable (per platform arch) that avoids the need to have a python interpreter, virtual environment etc already deployed on the arch. Ideally x86_64 Linux and windows to start with
thank you for your answer! The aiohttp based chat app i linked here is using already websockets. But does that mean that is also already parallel? &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; In the tornado documentation i only found this entry about it: [https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/guide/coroutines.html?highlight=parallel](https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/guide/coroutines.html?highlight=parallel) &amp;#x200B; in the aiohttp i did not found something similar. &amp;#x200B;
Use virtual environments (python -m venv &lt;project name&gt;). I came from npm mindset where global install was not the default. I assumed default for python was not system install. I assumed wrong and it was not a pleasant first experience. I would also upgrade pip with the --user flag. Again, carryover intuition from npm was to not even consider there was a --user flag. That was also not a good first experience since I was on Gentoo which heavily relies on the system python. After learning about 'venv', different ways to deploy, and some of the very practical (and stable) modules though, I'm finally enjoying python. I recommend this class. It was a ton of geeky fun: https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-3-masterclass-journey/
Search Sentdex on youtube. It's tutorials are short and simple. It will take less than 10 days to master in python basics. 
Well right at the moment Python is at the top of the language world and likely mid life span. This is fantastic for documentation as you note. Getting help can sometimes be an issue on the internet requiring you to filter out a lot of people that think they are good Python programmers. In general though you do have excellent support. Julia on the other hand just barely delivered version 1 and frankly doesn’t have the benefits any language that has been around awhile has. The only good thing here is the minor amount of bad advice to filter. That is you have more people proportionally right now that are early adopters and hopefully more knowledgeable as programmers. The real issue here is that Python is squarely stuck in the scripting world. That means there will ALWAYS be performance issues. Of course there are lots of libraries to hack around these issues but the performance is not native. The minute your own code becomes a bottle neck you will be writing C/C++. So here is my thought, pick a language that gives good performance to code you generate without a focus on highly crafted libraries. This means a language designed to be compiled from the beginning. Julia is one solution but you prbobaly should also look at Swift. Ignore the belly aching over Swift being an Apple solution and judge it on its writability. Swift is also very new and from my opinion will be version one quality with the up coming Swift 5 release. In either case there will be moments of frustration as is the case with anything new. However the benefits long term are huge. You get a modern language with modern features that are on the upward developmental slope. Either offers easy to get started code writing experience almost as good as Python yet you get the advantage of fast code generation through compiling. 
Windows OS will always suck in many ways unfortunately.

&gt; Which do you consider better in a case of failure of the python code. 1. Only the extension failing when it is called. I.e.: when pressing the icon 2. Chrome entirely fail to launch Neither. In either case, that's code you shouldn't have shipped. In case of unrecoverable bugs, you want it to fail loudly, consistently and as early as possible, because then you can find and fix the bug. You can only test a finite amount of inputs. If a bug doesn't manifest for those inputs that you test, you never discover it. Users _will_ discover it, and there will be consequences. At best, they will be annoyed and your reputation will suffer a little bit. A bug that triggers 100% of the time is easier to find than one that only triggers once in a blue moon. Even in code that reaches the customer, fail-early-fail-loudly is good, because the user can anticipate it: imagine the difference between a chrome extension that shows a tooltip on startup "hey this extension failed to load for these reasons" and one that doesn't show anything but just doesn't do anything when you try to click on its icon.
I want to see what people say about this.
`enumerate` is really useful for looping. But I would not recommend using `enumerate` in this way: &gt;&gt;&gt; list(enumerate(websites)) [(0, 'Coursera'), (1, 'EdX'), (2, 'Udacity')] Just use your original list. You can get from your index to your element really easily: &gt;&gt;&gt; websites = ['Coursera', 'EdX', 'Udacity'] &gt;&gt;&gt; websites[1] 'EdX' and if you elements are unique then you can go back the other way by using `list.index`: &gt;&gt;&gt; websites.index('Coursera') 0 
but she is beautiful
Very beautiful in fact. Public speaking isnt easy so I’m not trying to dismiss the effort here. Rather her pacing is something I find to be hard to take. It is almost as bad as a blackboard screech. She does seem to suffer from a common complaint I have with some woman which is give it a rest. A few pauses here and there makes conversation so much easier to digest. This has little todo with public speaking but rather a tendency of some to never stop talking. I see this at work with a few individuals. Of course nerves during public speaking can make this worse. In any event practice makes perfect and anything that promotes MicroPython is a good thing. 
look at the output : cs**d** != cs**v** !
Looks cool. Anyone know how much for the new board with sensor plug in? 
When Julia was created, Python had a much smaller scientific/ML community (users and modules). Since, at least at first, Julia was specifically targeted at MATLAB users, it comes with some small annoying things 1-based indexing by default. By the time Julia finally started to mature a bit, a bunch of people had moved from MATLAB to the Python ecosystem. &gt; Although Julia feels smoother, Python has waaay more documentation and support, due to it’s age and popularity. I'm waiting for the whole Julia ecosystem to mature a bit more to consider it more seriously. Many older Julia projects don't support Julia 1.0 yet.
You should definitely read more about asynchronous programming and check asyncio library. I am not familiar with tornado, but it seems to be a small confusion in wording. Parallel in 'multi' means that it runs multiple coroutines at the same time and the order of execution is not sequential. E.g., if you have functions f1 and f2, they will do it in a single thread using single CPU, f1 will calculate somehing until it gets to await/yield, than f2 starts calculations until it gets to await/yield, etc. Await (with async) was introduced in python 3.5 (yield and generators were used before). Usually, await/yields assumes that IO needs to be done. This way, both f1 and f2 do the job and alternate between each other. If you have many such coroutines and they require a lot of IO, your thread will effectively process available data while other coroutines are waiting. If you run them synchronously, one after another, you will spend much more time, obviously. Spawning separate process/thread is also less effective if it is not heavy CPU task. Alternative to 'multi' seems to be 'gather' from asyncio https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.gather. It may be good to run several indeed parallel loops of execution (in separate processes). To do this, you can bind socket, fork and pass it to web.run_app in aiohttp. 
I always figured you're not supposed to be mucking around in the code that's generated by GUI builders. You're supposed to simply just use it. Therefore it shouldn't matter if the generated code is unreadable or not. Indeed, if you're modifying the generated code won't those changes disappear when you regenerate the code? The GUI builder I use for wxWidgets, wxFormBuilder, generates a class for every form you use the GUI builder for and then you derive from that class and use overridden methods to stick your code in. This way you never have to touch the generated code. It's been a while since I've used it, but I think the workflow for Qt Designer is similiar. At least when you use it with C++ (though I cant imagine it being any different under Python). 
Why should it be?
I'm currently working on small college project which allow a client to control virtual machines (VBox) remotely using RESTful APIs. The server of REST (Flask) uses the VirtualBox commands to respond to the client. I completed like 80% of the work and that because VBox commands are harder then i thought.
Before Python had async functions, Python had generator based coroutines. \`yield from\` was used instead of \`await\`. The suggested alternative is to \`yield\` from a loop instead: async def foo(): for x in [1,2,3]: yield x 
Going through Colt Steele's Python 3 course. Almost done Lambda section, then moving onto Debugging. Really enjoying it so far!
I only use python (for the most part) is this a common thing to have?
And “c” is not a keyword in the C language either!
Not really what you asked for but here's my notes: Make a function that takes `G` as a parameter and returns `I, U` Calculate `U` with `np.arange(0, U_oc, .001)` Don't use a loop to calculate `I`, take advantage of numpy's vectorization Use `np.exp(x)` rather than `np.e ** x`
Cool! Maybe I remember to try it when I get to my computer.
Third for Kivy
Another vote for Kivy. I did some very interesting work with it on a touchscreen Raspberry Pi a while back. While there was no GUI interface for it, it integrated well with PyCharm and I was able to build things quickly.
Very awesome!
Try opening the file in gvim or notepad++ and view all characters on the line. My guess is the file is encoded wrongly. 
Planning a virtual pet simulation!!!
Why not it should be?

Wow this is very cool! Great work!
Because there's no reason for it?
I opened the file in notepad++ and it gets encoded in the same way.
You need to organize your thoughts better because your post makes no sense to me. As far as your code goes you have the same problem. When writing Math heavy code always make use of a comment block at the top of the file that either references the math you are using or actually explain what the formula is and what it is doing. This can help people greatly that are reading your code. Your variable declarations could use better commenting too. Though a suitable comment block at the top defining the formula and what it does may suffice for some of those variables. In any event your posted code is one of my pet peeves with respect to math heavy code. Such code should always have a well done comment block that dives into what the code does and the underlying formula. Or that comment block should have a reference to the material that the math is derived from. In the end nobody is going to know what you are doing here unless they are deeply involved in the same exact technology. Beyond all of that I can’t understand why you are even working on this without an understanding of arrays, lists and like. This isn’t even a Python thing per say you really need to understand data structures, in this case maybe simple ones, to organize data as it is created. If you are using Matplitlib the data structures you use need to be compatible with matplotlib. In any event a few suggestions: 1. Index into an array or list to store your values. 2. Make use of print statements during the developmental phase to make sure your complex computations are on track. This is simple old fashion debugging but lends itself to that warm fuzzy feeling that your code is making the computations it should be making. 3. Sometimes it makes sense to break up long strings of code into smaller chunks and then use temporary variables to hold the data. It can be tricky to get this real gut though as the goal is to increase readability not decrease it. 4. White space is your friend. 5. So are functions. Not only are they your friends, they can make for a clearer meaning with respect to communications with others. 
It would be a nice way to invoke an external process. 
When I've gotten desperate, delete the line and retype it in. 
That's actually really well done - especially for better control of command line applications
I don't think this is gonna work lol. 
Thanks for your time and your suggestions. Like I said, I am not a programmer, this is the first programming task I have ever attempted. I have assignments which need to be completed and this is one of them. Obviously from my post, I am confused and looking for direction on how to store all of the values of I and U from each iteration of G in a list. I didnt realize my post was so confusing. I will update it for clarification...
She was born that way, I guess. The more important question us why that would matter to you.

**I'm not gonna lie. I love it.** For a UI , you have forward progression with no undo button, which is a nightmare for the standard user. The average user uses Reddit, Instagram, Canva. Web-based GUI where you can jump around the decision making flow pretty quickly. The people that actually use command line are programmers. **If you want to continue developing this, I'd suggest gearing it towards needs that programmers had.** For example... I like the idea that you could take this UI and combine it with another program that reads through programs to get all of their potential inputs and descriptions, and also their data types, flags, etc. So if you call cURL for the first time. Instead of having to read the documentation, you could pipe cURL into your program, and it would say: * Here are the inputs it allows, which would you like: * Would you like more info about that input? (y/n): * Okay please enter \[data type\]: * Would you like to add any of these flags?: * Would you like to pipe this into any other programs?: It's a great way to add training wheels to a large amount of command line programs really quickly. **What do you want to do with it, if anything?**
Very cool! BTW, you can also use the unicode snowflake charactes: ❄ ❅ ❆.
Obviously your place is in the 1900's. Please step away from the computer, or be charged with anachronism.
We’re talking fairly structured data and a fairly well defined question, so I would stay away from noSQL databases like Mongo. Depending on the size of the data, SQLite could be a good starting point for this. To update, you can just insert new rows at the bottom of the tables. You could use pandas or PETL to standardise the data before adding to the DB. Google sheets is nice in regards to easy access and viewability, but honestly I found that the API isn’t great for this kind of stuff.
Make sure that file is saved as utf8.

The pyboard is £45 from https://store.micropython.org/ You can purchase Shenzhen knock-offs for as little as £10 from ebay. The originals are very well built - I've had one in a box for years and it still works. But the cheap ones are rubbish. I've purchased 3 and they were broken on delivery.

That guy's post history is nearly entirely women hating. What a sick person.
And programming was invented by a woman. Either way it means nothing, take your incel mysoginy elsewhere dude.
Thanks! I even though about it, but I worry about people who is using terminals with poor Unicode support (like urxvt). But I'd gladly check out related pull request
Programming was invented by a woman and so was the first compiler. What difference does it make
I absolutely agree with your point of fail early fail loudly. Unfortunately some software I code tools for are not that friendly to tell me that « hey that add on failed to load » kinda message they simply crash and never launch, which sucks a lot :)
I like the way trio can work with the stdlib and the interpreter to provide added value. Python and the stdlib can only iterate at a slow pace, which is a good thing for language stability. But Trio can move much faster. Together it seems like a good model for progress. And Trio really does hide much of the complexity of async
Scrape the gfycat page and grab the webm URL.
Once you scrape the subreddit for URL's, you can scrape the required URL you want. This can be used to get the right URL. 
I really love the arrow-able list. A nightmare for the typical command line program (which should always be driveable with `expect`) but I have an actual use-case that it would be really neat for. Is there any kind of callback or anything when choices are made/highlighted? Like, could I turn the bar green on certain options?
Very useful.
I like the way you write python. I know that google cloud's s3 equivalent cli tool can do operations in parallel just by passing an -m flag to the command. Does the aws cli not support this? 
If you have to go with a browser, Splash is nice. It has an HTTP API so it's not exactly what you're looking for, but the benefit of an HTTP API is that it becomes really easy to have multiple load balanced instances to help with performance. Additionally, you can send Splash Lua scripts to automate page interactions, which is great for things like SAML authentication or link scraping on JS heavy sites.
I'm not manually scraping if that's what you mean. I'm using praw and when I get the url for [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/aca3ee/these_kids_returning_a_wallet_they_found/), I get this link: &gt;https://gfycat.com/dangerousvictoriouscapybara Which doesn't work with my function. I'd need https://gfycat.com/DangerousVictoriousCapybara for it to work. 
Yeah, seems like this is my only option. Thanks.
Its a lie told by feminists. Men and women are different. Man is a warrior and woman should sit at home
I would love to create tools for coworkers to use through simple GUI. My work admins block executables from installing so I’m not sure if that would be an impediment.
I would suggest learning BeautifulSoup. For me it's personally the best to scrape anything on the internet.
Yeah it looks like that is my only option, was hoping for an easier way out. Guess I'll experiment with that a bit, thanks for the reply.
How many enemies have you bested in combat this month, warrior?
Would python_prompt_toolkit work for you?
Good stuff mate. Thanks for this explanation. I can think of cases of runtime imports causing this sort of mayhem. I am often torn between doing it right vs causing slowdown. Or doing something more rapidly and avoid a lot of refactoring. For example: doing a CLI tool that can run only in the shell or optionally launch a GUI version. I would tend to delay all of the GUI import only when the -gui argument is requested thus making the non GUI version faster to load. But I see how this can become a bitch to debug. 
Upload that file somewhere so that we can look at it's contents directly. Copy-and-pasting can sometimes change things.

For the advice you’re looking for, you could create a structure of lists like `[[(I, U),(I, U),...],[],[],[],...]` where the index into the outer list is your iterations over G, and the inner lists contain your I and U values as pairs (a tuple). This is the most simple way I can think of, without using a more specialized structure like a dictionary.
You can also put MicroPython on other boards, such as Wemos D1 which are available very cheaply.
What's with the NSFW tag?
pyinstaller executables can be run off a flash drive. I'm pretty sure there's no installation required. If it blocks any foreign executable it might be a problem though.
It will run on the ESP8266 and ESP32 (with some issues) boards. It can also be loaded on many of the STM32 NUCLEO boards since the official board is based on the STM32. There's also the PyCom branded boards (like the LoPy4) which are very good and have LoRa long distance wireless. Just a word of warning, if you plan to install yourself on a non-official board there's a degree of complexity involved. If you can follow instructions and do some research it's not bad. Otherwise get an official board.

I wouldn't say loading onto a ESP8266 board is particularly complex. There is a good walkthrough here: https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/tutorial/intro.html
Maybe some type of points system with appropriate flair?
Postgres handles concurrent access on its own. You can open many connections and it will ensure they are properly parallelized.
Exactly what you are describing already exists, it was posted a week or so ago.
It's a lot easier than the while loop
That's programming for you! Can you link it?
Source?
Will do once the grimoire is a bit more mature and properly cleaned up.
Wow, this is an interesting project! Have been looking for something to replace PyPDF2 for a while now. Will contribute where I can. 
Not at all.
Link?
https://github.com/isacikgoz/tldr
With, of course, one important caveat: just because concurrent access is safe for Postgres, doesn't mean they're safe for your data. Fortunately, Postgres (and many other DBMS) provide a simple and effective mechanism to protect your data in the form of transactions. Just remember to use them.
You missed `self` when referencing `message` in your `__str__()` method: ``` return str("HTTP Error: {}. {}".format(self.status_code,message)) ``` vs. ``` return str("HTTP Error: {}. {}".format(self.status_code,self.message)) ``` 
why so much? 
thx :) yes the cli supports parallel calls by default, given that can use a regex to describe the files that you want to download or when downloading a complete folder. Not sure how you can feed a list of files to the cli and not have it block at each one - also trying to use the cli that way seems way more awkward than having a python script (which in my case also creates the list of files) make a parallel boto3 call. 
I always use concurrent futures and try to make it work with tqdm. I haven't seen dask used in this way before but it looks pretty handy I'll have to play with it. 
[Here you go](https://github.com/m1233/Error/blob/master/pyinstaller-script.py)
Me I didn't know tqdm and sometimes I have been in need of a nice progress bar library, thx :) 
No. I want full screen data entry forms in text only, like old mainframe or AS400 forms. At this point it looks like the best TUI libs are in Java... Imagine my use case is for embedded systems. Not everyone wants a LAMP stack for a simple application, nor a huge GUI.
It is saved as a .py file since it is a python script
thank you guys, that is good news I guess I was still fixated on what I had to do to make it work with sqlite which required something like multiple workers to run the task and one worker to write to the DB to avoid race conditions

also you don't need to wrap the return from `format()` with `str()` it is already `str`
No, the encoding of the file, not the file extension, needs to be utf8.
Nice tip! I'll have to remember that.
Totally, and very user friendly if you can't take the time to learn the code. I like to write a lot of template classes and custom subclasses in PyQt, which I don't know if you can create through Designer or not. Having well written code also means future readers/writers can understand it and adapt it. And yes, any modifications will be lost if you bring in the ui block from Designer again. So I just avoid Designer from the start.
Interested in knowing as well. I’m learning through CodeCademy now Python 2 and it’s a decent course. 
The callback is a very interesting idea - kind of allowing instant customization. Do you mind creating an issue for that?
wow that is pretty cool 
Oh yes the encoding of the file is utf-8. When I opened it in idle it gave me a message saying that it will convert it to utf-8
for me the most important use case right now are tools where the command line interaction is not the main focus but where using such a library will make it a lot nicer for the user. E.g. asking for an output path or requesting the user to confirm a dangerous action (overwriting an existing file). &amp;#x200B; as you said, right now the goal is to add training wheels to a lot of tools with a very simple api
Nice one! I am going to check this out this weekend.
That is often the trade-off. But at times you can get around this with a design change and a bit of extra work. For example, you can make an efficient CLI tool that gets called by a separate GUI executable. You can use pipes or sockets to communicate with such a tool that runs in the background like a service. Separating UX from functional code in different executables is a very old pattern of design. It’s long history in the Unix world is owed to its tendency to produce very stable and robust systems. That is in addition to its performance benefits. This design style has the side benefit over time of building up tools that lend easily to automation processes because bypassing your GUIs is trivial. Also, depending on the import order of the modules you depend on, explicitly importing exactly what you need from a library can often be much more efficient. Avoid ‘Import &lt;module&gt;.*’ if at all possible.
&gt; I have to fight every day to survive That makes sense, if you view half of the population as your enemy, and most of the rest as their collaborators.
You don't even say WHAT you're using notebooks for. If you're just using it to prototype or do exploratory data analysis, it's a fantastic tool. If you're trying to build a library, learn python, or using it as a general project environment, then of course it has limitations: it's not designed for that use case.
I used it for what it's done : explore the data And I've been forced to do other things like actual coding. Even for the data exploration, I just don't see the benefits from using console/scripts, apart from the visual aspect.
Firstly you should share your code as it's hard to provide accurate help. Secondly the issue is you have options that are longer than one character while using the single dash prefix Anything longer than a single character should use two dashes because the default behaviour is to treat `-url` as `-u -r -l` Switch the short names to being one character and it should resolve itself
How about... wait for it... excel?
If I never coded in Cobol, I would have trolled you on that. But you're right, worst tools exists..
I code on a Chromebook and desktop. Obviously the power is at the desktop, but if I'm travelling and need to prototype a few bits the Chromebook is more than enough. Currently I'm setting up a VM server so I can have a dedicated Linux VM for programming that I can use from my Chromebook (have power of a desktop but portability of a laptop), but it's not up yet. I have two roommates at opposite ends of the spectrum, one pretty much only uses a 13" Dell to do his coding, even though he has a desktop. The other pretty much only uses his desktop even though he has a laptop. At the end of the day it isn't a matter of us making you like one thing or the other. If you've found a set up that works for you and your use case, that's all that matters.
Access comes to mind 😆
Have yet to need to generate a PDF or write super serious programs but this is cool. I will try to remember this when I need it
Thanks for your answer! I resolved the problem: I disabled "allow\_abbrev". [https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#prefix-matching](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#prefix-matching) In that example they also use single-dash-arguments that are longer than one character...
The [original version](https://github.com/m1233/Error/commit/404352f6030ecad4d21d54a77a35a6a9bd8516ab) that you uploaded would be exactly the kind of thing that would cause this error. But then you changed it for some reason, so now it's not clear to me what's going on. What is the actual content of the file?
I look at Jupyter Notebook (if that's what you're talking about) as a better Pyhon console. If I want to quickly sketch up something or transform some data etc. It's easier for me than to write a whole module. For example I scraped all the monsters' data from Pathfinder and I stored them in an sqlite database but later when I learned MongoDB I quickly converted and cleaned it in Jupyter to be able to use it.
Django comes with its own ORM (Object Relational Mapper). While you can use SQLAlchemy with Django, I'd highly recommend you stick with django's own ORM.
Never done it but I think pandas is what you want
It does not produce bad code, bad habits and unmaintainable code. *You* produce bad code, bad habits and unmaintainable code. It's a poor workman that blames his tools. Notebooks have a use case. If you're trying to fit a square peg into a round hole, then of course it would be frustrating. Really, though, it just sounds like you're being obstinate because you're being forced to use a tool you don't want to use. That's not the tool's fault. 
Django’s ORM is a dumpster fire. I would recommend SQL Alchemy, which I’ve found to be superior in almost every respect. Django ORM is seriously bad...
Can I take it that you are saying don't use SQLAlchemy now because you will use Django's ORM later ? But what do I do in the mean time ..It will be like an year till I eventually give my app a Web GUI
Dont know about the second course but the first course Python Bible I had briefly and the Ziyad guy seems like he was a good instructor and the course was outlined fairly well from what I remember to get the basics of Python. That being said I only had it briefly because at that time I had tons and tons of Python learning material and had a solid understanding of the fundamentals. I think I was looking for a specific type of infomration. So I emailed him before I bought it to ask if this was covered or would be covered. He emailed me back enthusiatically saying "you're in luck I have another supplement coming soon that will cover both what I was looking for and more!" So I bought it I didnt really watch the whole thing only a few things that I still struggled to undestand concept wise which was Classes/OOP which were the last chapter iirc. So most of my review is based on going thru that section. That being said his supplemental was a lie. It was basically a decent guide on how to get started freelance web design with Django fast, and then at the end turned into a direct upsell. So that left a bad taste in my mouth and REFUND. lol. Other than that he was quite enjoyable That being said I dont understand why people ask about Udemy course for fundamentals. Like Youtube has a BUNCH of free beginners shit. Like my favorite course I did end up buying was a bundled course of other peoples material from Udemy and i found out later that one of them was already free from Semtex at PythonProgramming.net (and that he has a bunch more courses for free that cover more than te fundamentals). There are also a ton more other similar courses for free or books thall get you basically suited
Look, when I uploaded the error message on github I talked with someone. He got a bit confused because my user name is in greek. To avoid another confusion when uploading the File here and on github I basically wrote the user name with english characters. I haven't changed anything to the original file that I have on my computer and also I have never faced a problem with the fact that my user name is written with greek characters so I thought that it wouldn't cause a problem. When adding the file to the repository the greek characters became those weird letters that you see on the first line. [Here](https://github.com/m1233/Error/blob/master/pyinstaller-script.py) is the file exactly how I have it on my computer
Pycharm community edition is free, why not stick with that?
Basically I tried to avoid a confusion and created another 
as /u/opcenter said, just download the [community edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download).
a simple text file? Excel is great as long as you can make sure the user has excel, but for some linux users or server application excel is a no go.
Tysm, no idea how I didn’t see that in the first place 😅
For you csv or a text file would be best. It's easy to read/write. And. Really basic to use. 
You could use Django's ORM for the CLI app as well. (Here's a short HowTo)[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/937742/use-django-orm-as-standalone]. That said, there's nothing stopping you from using SQLAlchemy with Django later on. It's merely a question how well everything integrates and works out of the box.
Sounds interesting. Keep us posted!
**tl;dr:** `dict.get(key, default)` only returns the default value if the key is not present. If the value is `None`, then that is returned. As documented. 
This is a strange article, presenting that snow is white as a discovery. It has nothing to do with dict.get(). If you call a member of a result of any function, but the function returns none, you get an exception. Solution? Test for none. Looks like the author is in the middle of his own first python course. &amp;#x200B;
I would just use JSON objects, because you can just dump it all into named variables in one go, no need for parsing really.
Dont learn Python2 right now. It's not gonna be supported long. Definitely switch to Python3. Luckily the languages arent too different but it will help you to get used to the changes now
RE project Euler, personally I wouldn't say that I completed it on my resume, but if you feel good about your solutions then put them in a GitHub repo and put your GitHub account on your resume. That's your portfolio, if a potential employer sees value in project Euler and algorithms then they can see it for themselves
Geany is nice and simple.
Personally use shelve.
 Of course it is not groundbreaking news. It is only a small thing to remember. I decided to write this piece after noticing that many people think that `my_dict.get('my_key', 'default_value')` is equivalent to `my_dict.get('my_key') or 'default_value'`. As stated in the beginning (I just made it clearer) of the article, if you already knew and remembered this, this article was not for you :).
I like how CodeCademy goes through the lessons. Is there a similar platform that teaches Python 3?
1: read the sidebar 2: post questions like these in /r/learnpython 3: read THAT sidebar
Look, you focus it up on a wrong point. The things to really remember are: 1) functions can return **None** 2) dict with a value of **None** is not the same as a dict without the value. **None** is in no way special, it is a value like everything else. If you keep that in mind, the get() will cause you no trouble because its behaviour when encountering the **None** value is very transparent: it returns it as is. Go for deep understanding, not learning the quirks. If get() did not return the None value from dict, replacing it with provided default, now that would be highly illogicval and worth an article about it.

Create a simple to use GUI where the user can see and modify the parameters, store them in whatever format is handy for your scripts (json, sqlite, txt, yaml, toml, ...) Don't ask your user(s) to edit directly the `very important file containing the extremely important parameters that make or break the script, so be careful and follow the rules exactly when you change something in this file` file. They will make a mistake and it will cause you headaches and frustration...
I’m pretty sure he’s talking about jupyter notebooks, not laptops
Hey! This looks like a great project! Do you know if your library plays well with [Hue](https://github.com/s0md3v/hue) ?
fyi, you don't have to unpack the values by hand. Format string can do it for you def __str__(self): return "HTTP Error: {0.status_code}. {0.message}".format(self) or def __str__(self): return "HTTP Error: {obj.status_code}. {obj.message}".format(obj=self) or in py3.6+ def __str__(self): f"HTTP Error: {self.status_code}. {self.message}" 
I dont know what CodeCademy is unfortunately. I dont really learn python at a beginners level anymore sorry. Though, when I went to a Techies Meetup/Hub for Minorities they introduced me to CodeWars.com. It may be similar. You dont actually get a lesson (as far as I am aware) but you get tested to write out code and get a certain result. It may be cool if you want to actively flex your brain. They range from easy to hard too. Other than that the way most people do it is firing up the interpreter on their own machine (or in the cloud) and following along there.
There is also [`pygubu`](https://github.com/alejandroautalan/pygubu) which would deserve more popularity in my opinion. This is basically a WYSIWYG GUI editor for `tkinter`, but this works quite very well.
Jupyter notebooks? How funny I literally just watched a video on a course that I bought 2 years ago that added a few more segments. I never understood Jupyter notebooks and that vid didnt really help. Ive used maybe once at a Python meetup at the instruction of this science chick. I think I realized then that it's probably geared for Data Scientists. That being said IPython(3). IPython is fantastic. Just for %paste% alone, but additionally I love using it for live programming testing. Its like having a really cool sensible smart IDE built into the interpreter rather than python3.exe alone. I also have benefitted greatly that history persists upon exit too. 
If you like ipython, you’ll like « jupyter qtconsole »
Hey, thanks! Next week we'll be releasing Ariadne 0.2 that includes support for async query execution and resolvers (among other improvements). That should pave the way for possible Starlette integrations.
Wait dont you hate Jupyter?
Then what’s the use case ? I’ve been using it for data science, what it has been made for I guess And, of course the user is to blame. But using notebook forces you to write all in one file, no modularity. Importing notebooks just failed a long time. And the code is unmaintainable. The only way to make it maintainable is restarting the kernel each time you want to test and execute everything , what’s the point ?
I recently learned tkinter, but got nothing else to do, being pretty new to python I cannot find any well rounded projects to work on, &amp;#x200B; Already did Discord Bot, that was fun though.
Yup. Notebooks computers are awesome !
Why not using a console then ? Jupyter’s qtconsole or ipython are really good. And they have code completion. 
I find myself using my keyboard macro as a multiple-copy paste thing alot, and deleting it after. Works nicely if you have a programmable keyboard
I just hate notebooks, not jupyter. In Notebooks there’s no code completion. Even the console does it with ipython

Make sure to use classes for a few projects! I spent soooo long not using them because I could not figure out any application.
Alright. There’s one thing I like about notebooks is code presentation. The only thing that equals notebooks is generated doc. There’s different drawbacks but both are cool. 
&gt; I'd love to hear suggestions for improvement; a lot of times I found myself copy-pasting sections of code and just changing a list name or something, which seems distinctly unpythonic to me. 10yr+ software developer here. Nothing wrong with copy paste. Just make sure you understand the code you are borrowing and you'll be fine! 
I would strongly recommend against using Splash as it relies on qtwebkit which has not been maintained in a very long time. Chrome headless or chrome/firefox via selenium are options that use actively maintained projects.
Some cool projects in there, gotta check it out!
Thanks tmbo454, very cool. A couple of ideas/suggestions: 1) Add a way to use some kind of validators for string input, e.g. must be numeric, min length, max length, permitted chars etc ? 2) For the "prompt" multi-question method: When the user has finished, add an option to show a review of all user choices, and then either accept, or restart answering questions (or even revisit a particular question only)?
Sounds fun! Viber has an API too it seems, I might setup something different (because python automatically downloads anyway)
Ahh ok gotcha. Def dont even use that then
Sounds Nice, I always wanted to use tkinter to make a text-box thing with a picture, like: [http://prntscr.com/m3i292](http://prntscr.com/m3i292)
Be careful... it might turn... feral :)

Use what most closely resembles the underlying data structure. csv for a 2D array, JSON for something heirarchial.
I have read a forum post somewhere saying it was somewhere around a couple of thousand dollars I guess... The riverbanks website has nothing but a contact form, thus pricing might be tailored to each costumer. but I'm just guessing
Yeah, I that was my first impression, then I tried to integrate a pyqt5/4 based widget (ipython qtconsole/richjupyterwidget) from PySide2 based Gui, but obviously that failed. My lesson learned: Though the API seems mostly identical, the backend is incompatible. 
&gt;level 4ricocotamOriginal Poster1 point · 31 minutes agoI just hate notebooks, not jupyter. In Notebooks there’s no code completion. Even the console does it with ipython So you don't like notebooks because of low code area usability? I want to know
You can’t reuse the code properly -&gt; unmaintainable work and bad habits No code completion -&gt; bad tool Those only two reasons are enough but I can think of more if you ask
There actually is code completion in notebooks, alongside with many other IDE features. What I really miss though are some of PyCharm’s refactoring tools but any console lacks them for good so whatever. 
There is ? I never saw it and I think I have the latest version. Of course if by installing 12 other libs you can have a lot more features. But consoles already have that and I don’t see why using notebooks over console
Yes, because i genuinely thought it is a great idea. I can't be first time learner any more, so learning your experience is important to me.
Alright. Then I suggest you to read Joel Grus’ presentation about notebooks at the Jupyter Conference ;)
Not a sec guy here but generally books are less than ideal for learning CS topics and I’d bet this is especially true in security, the information changes constantly and becomes irrelevant quickly. All the info can be found online and then some.

Sorry for slightly off-topic because I am not sure what you mean by notebooks, Do you mean using something to keep snip bits of code so you can learn it over and over in a book, because I find that very useful.
Do it man. Let me know how it goes. 
Python's a great place to start, and an excellent tool. I agree that you should get comfortable with Python for now... then learn other tools, depending on what tasks interest you. Html/CSS/JS is nice if you want to build websites or interactive apps that run without installing. Rust is nice if you want fast, low-level programming with great docs, a great community, and modern features.
Found a free version of Fluent Python on the internet. I've ordered the book by the local book store after reading the first chapter. This book is excellent for one who knows the syntax but needs a better in-depth conceptual understanding. Thanks for your post!
Thank you, if I wanted to focus on backend development would I still need css/html or would you reccomend something else?
Python alone is sufficient for backend. Ruby and Rust are also nice.
No ^^ I’m talking about jupyter notebooks
The new version that you've uploaded is different from the other two. I need to see the exact bytes of the file without any editing or anything like that. I don't care whether the contents of the file look correct to you on github, because that will depend a lot on the way that your machine is configured (which is part of what I'm trying to find out by doing this). Lets do this a different way. Run this code and tell me what it prints: import pathlib path = pathlib.Path.home() / 'AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35\Scripts\pyinstaller-script.py' print(path.read_bytes()[:30]) I suspect that what's happening here is that this file is encoded in iso8859-7, which is a reasonable encoding for greek language computers. Unfortunately the file doesn't tell python how it's encoded, so python assumes that it's utf8 and so can't read it properly. The program that created this file (probably `pip`, but possibly `setuptools`. I don't know exactly) created it incorrectly and has a bug. The best thing to do would be to try this on a later version of python and pip and see if it's been fixed. If not, report the bug to the pip maintainers.
That's a tall order. Why these requirements?
Try pressing ESC. In Sublime Text 3 and others IDE's works.
Check out Pyglet.
have you tried google? I'm willing to bet that you will find multiple videos and tutorials about game programming in python without too much trouble. 
You have only raised three concerns, which can be worked around quite easily, and are only drawbacks in certain contexts. In my opinion, it seems like you haven't spent much time actually googling these issues and came here for validation/to argue. \---You can’t reuse the code properly: [https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Importing%20Notebooks.html](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Importing%20Notebooks.html) \---Can't maintain code: not if you aren't paying attention to your environment/blindly creating cells. for many, the block structure of code cells is MUCH easier to keep track of then a complete singular code file. \---No code completion: 1. pip install jupyter\_contrib\_nbextensions 2. jupyter contrib nbextension install --user 3. jupyter notebook 4. One of the tabs should now show "Nbextensions" There, you will find "Hinterland". Check the box to enable. Not everyone working in a data science context comes from a software/CS background. Jupyter notebooks allow the flexibility to include text/widgets/visualizations inline, which is HUGE for ad-hoc data analysis, especially when this analysis needs to be shared with people of all technical skill levels. The flexibility and ease of use will outweigh the negatives that you have brought up, and those negatives are largely irrelevant for many of the people who use notebooks.

PySDL2. It also had Open GL bindings. C++ wrapper though.
thanks for the recommendations but I need some help ..could you point me to the notable differences that made you prefer one to the other? For beginner eyes they might not be fundamentally different.
I'm okay with this statement in r/python. It doesn't feel very pythonic. It's pretty decent for basic exploratory analysis. You're probably end up using something more sophisticated for production quality work. So I don't 100% disagree with OP.
I lived that life for far too long
That is what I wanted to know ..if using Alchemy now will limit my options later
You're still in college? You can get the [pro version for free](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/)
Thonny in advanced/expert mode. https://thonny.org/ 
I’m in high school lol but thanks for the advice my friend
I'm fairly new to python, so I'm working through Automate the Boring Stuff to get a feel for it before moving on to bigger projects.
Okay, thanks. Is my program well-written?
Thanks for this, why the author decided to use Medium is beyond me. The site's structure is not good for link organization.

As dafvidw pointed out, you can use PySDL2 as an OpenGL binding. I recommend starting by learning GLSL; eg how to write shaders. As an exercise, create python data structures (Classes?) for 3d essentials: nodes, vectors, meshes, higher-level 3d objects etc.
VsCode
You can try Automate The Boring Stuff
Automate the boring stuff (free book). And please ask such questions on /r/learnpython Also, check the wikis of both subs
Thanks. I’ll be sure to post there in future. Sorry about that.
Vscode or if it's really for Euler stuff Spyder is a good fit, it's good for scripting and science stuff but not the greatest for big projects, git integration being the main issue
Even as a backend developer, you're going to want to be able to produce working html and css. If you're serious about being a backend web developer, then the basic requirements would be Python plus at least one (preferably 2) of the major backend frameworks (Django, Flask, etc.), Javascript plus the major frontend frameworks (jquery, Angular, Node, Bootstrap, some combination or more appropriately all of them), and be able to replicate the drawings of a web designer into working HTML and CSS. The major distinction is that you generally won't be doing the actual front-end UI designing, but you still have to write the code that generates dynamic content, and that dynamic content is going to be delivered (by your code) as HTML and/or javascript/JSON in a format that works with the above mentioned frameworks. Unless you're going for an extremely specific job opening that only supports one web app, you're going to end up using a lot of different toolkits and you'll want to be able to show that you can do that.
&gt; Python alone is sufficient for backend I disagree. Unless you're making the backend to something that doesn't have a frontend, then your output has to be something other than Python. That's going to mean at a minimum basic knowledge of HTML and JSON just to be barely qualified, more reasonably a professional should have a professional level of knowledge of HTML/CSS and Javascript to be able to debug when the inevitable problems happen.
Might still work: &gt; accredited educational institutions: high schools, colleges, universities 
WingIDE is great
Agreed, I never found why I need it - ipython is great.

I have purchased a number of Packt books in the past and the common theme was Low Quality. My guess is that Packt is simply going for quantity and not quality. Sell as many mediocre books as possible. 
&gt; Tkinter is quite old and doesn't look very modern This is misinformation at best. See [this response on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/349409/why-are-tk-guis-considered-ugly). 1. See [Bryan Oakley's comment here](http://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2015/03/02/pydev-of-the-week-bryan-oakley/): &gt; I think Tkinter is an absolutely fantastic GUI library, especially combined with the object oriented nature of Python. Many people deride it as old, ugly, and hard to learn. After having used many GUI toolkits spanning more than a couple decades I’ve come to realize that most of that is untrue, and what is untrue doesn’t really matter. I would never use tkinter to create the next photoshop or itunes, but for the vast majority of GUIs most people write, it’s more than good enough. 2. See [Bryan Oakley's other comment](): &gt; I think part of the reason is that Tk is surprisingly powerful and easy to use but it doesn't do much hand-holding. Since it is so easy, people with little experience in UI design can get something to work in very short order. But, without a lot of experience they rely on defaults and shortest-path-to-a-solution (read: don't take time to hide scrollbars when they aren't needed, don't use common idioms for toolbars, don't properly align widgets, etc). &gt; &gt; ... &gt; &gt; With tk 8.5 (and actually for a couple years prior) there is support for themes and for native widgets, and even the X11 version gets a minor facelift. Tk is still behind the curve in eye candy though, forcing one to "roll their own" if the design calls for gradients, animations and so forth. 
You're not alone at all. Notebooks are vastly inferior to PyCharm's scientific mode.
Spyders great for project Euler. I use it for just that
Idle is a starter IDE they won't drop for political reasons. It barely works. I recommend using something more industry standard like Pycharm. You can also use an editor like Sublime, Atom, VSCode, Notepad++ if you don't need all the features of an IDE.
exactly my thought process
[Hypothesis did this too](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changes.html#v3-79-3), and discovered it's only possible in Python &gt;= 2.7.9! I honestly can't wait to drop Python 2.7 forever... less than a year to go now.
I use jupyter for working with Sympy. The console kind of sucks in comparison.
That should be a decently trivial thing to implement, good for a first project. Try it out!
It sounds like you need to spend more time learning how to properly use the notebooks. The claims you make about lack of functionality are straight up wrong. \--- *But using notebook forces you to write all in one file, no modularity*: wrong. use multiple notebooks, link them to each other directly in the code or with hyperlinks in the markdown. use a notebook that calls a notebook that calls another notebook. When I am using notebooks, I usually have a data loading notebook, and transformation and EDA notebook, a modeling notebook, etc. \--- *Importing notebooks just failed a long time*: you clearly have never spent more than 15 minutes trying to do this. It is quite easy if you actually try. \--- *And the code is unmaintainable. The only way to make it maintainable is restarting the kernel each time you want to test and execute everything*: seems like you have issues with how you are writing your code if things only work by restarting the entire kernel. &amp;#x200B; How long have you actually been developing in a notebook environment? If I had to guess, you are a CS student that is upset about having to use notebooks for an assignment. Actually try these things before you run around complaining that they don't work. 
I'm actually starting to learn django, for those who don't know it, it's a python based web framework. I really was a UI guy and I always preferred console app so web development, with all this css shit I hate, was never my strength, but now a day with bootstrap and all these available templates easy to integrate with django I think I'm finally ready to start back web development again. Last time I did web was like 4 years ago with PHP... Not the same game anymore. 
I’m not a data scientist and normally don’t work in Jupyter notebooks, but I was asked recently to perform some investigation and analysis for a fairly basic business problem, something like how many customers have access to an external service across dimensions like country, operational office, and season. I was taking the work over from someone else who had started it in a Jupyter notebook, so I figured I’d continue using the notebook. There was no reason it couldn’t have been done in ipython or with a script or some reporting platform, and no one forced me to use the notebook. I found it to be a pretty positive experience overall. Here are some of my takeaways: 1. The person who had started the work had formatted the notebook like a narrative, which made it really easy to get up to speed on (it was an area I didn’t know all that well). 2. The inline output, many of them being snippets of dataframes, just looked nice. I don’t work with pandas heavily but in a terminal they always look crazy (there’s probably some pretty print that could help). 3. I continued with the narrative approach and the final notebook looked great, like an interactive abstract. 4. When I published the notebook, I just sent the requestor the link. I asked if they needed a walkthrough, but the narrative format made it unnecessary. 5. The requestor was not a developer, but was able to interact with the notebook and play around with it, extending it to perform the same analysis across different dimensions. 6. When the requestor presented the findings to their bosses, I didn’t receive a single question about how anything was arrived at, though I did receive some feedback, both positive and constructive. It felt like receiving a code review, and opened up good discussions about related business problems. It was a very transparent and open process. 7. The original business problem seemed like a one-off, but if we were to ever make it an official report in our reporting platform, the notebook is basically the best spec I’ve ever seen in the real world. Some random takeaways: 1. There were features added to the notebook that I thought could be useful in other applications, so I moved them into a separate library and imported them into the notebook. Not sure that’s what others do, but it worked for me. 2. I wasn’t sure how to test the work in the notebook. I probably should have looked into it further, but I ended up using general asserts just for sanity checks. The stuff I moved into the library I wrote proper unit tests for. 3. When I moved items from the notebook into the library I basically cut and paste. It wasn’t horrible, but I felt like there was probably a better way. Maybe something like the %save command in ipython. Most of the negatives were because I didn’t take the time to look into actual solutions, though most of them were minor. Despite the positive experience I had in this one case, I’m not using notebooks daily for my regular work. I like my editor/IDE workflow, down to my fonts and colour schemes and custom key bindings. I did do some of the notebook work in my usual IDE (PyCharm), which gave me access to those features, but at the time PyCharm rendered notebooks a bit janky (I believe they’ve improved them recently). In a few other comments you mentioned autocomplete not working, which I found odd as they worked for me outside of PyCharm (in the normal ipython way). I think gotos even worked, though I could be misremembering that. When you say you are being forced to use notebooks, what exactly do you mean? Are you able to move helper functions and stuff into a library you can import into the notebook? If I was in that situation, I’d figure out how to get notebooks working in my editor/IDE of choice and just spit out something presentable at the end. How do you handle tests? Funnily enough, the thoughts you mentioned about notebooks leading to poor code are the same thoughts I hear from C++ devs who have to work in python! Hope you found my experience interesting at least! 
It’s not, but medium is a cool platform 
I like atom
I was all about CSV til I was in a situation where I needed to store dictionaries in a dictionary, and realized that it’s essentially JSON format. I think it’s the easiest way to import export data. 
Whoever told you that.... don't take any programming advice from that person again.
Are you going to name it Orwell

It's an exciting pep, however, I wonder when will it add to stdlib.

Already filed an [issue](https://github.com/invoice-x/factur-x-ng/issues/39). Will take care when working on it the next time.
Perhaps you are up to no good?
I just what to use a service from one site to another (just creating a interface between). Givin the correct answer to the source, so they can have the captcha answer. 
This sounds like a bad idea for many reasons, including security and cross site limitations of resource access. What is your actual overall goal? Maybe someone can suggest a better implementation than what you're trying to do.
Check the formula again. You need to divide by 4 at the end, not 3. --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
The area of a triangle is equal to : b*h/2...
Isn't the formula. /4 rather than /3?
There's a question early on about how many pull requests I make or whatever and the answer is 0. All the rest of the questions assume this is a thing that I'm doing, which is 100% false.
Thats okay 0 is a perfectly acceptable answer and no to the rest is okay too. Thanks for your input. 
Ya try this
Meh, I gave up. The questions were too foreign to the way I work. Instead of "source control" you seem to be asking about github/gitlab in particular.
Area * x**2 /4 Sry for the poor formatting but try this
Mercurial and git have the same concepts of pull/merge request and branching. Are you using something else? Maybe I’m way off base for the rest of the python community?
&gt;Is this true I mean, yes, python is what would commonly be referred to as a "scripting language", but this usually only means that it is interpreted instead of being compiled. Being "just a scripting language" doesn't validate or invalidate anything done with it. &gt;what should I be learning to supplement my python knowledge? Whatever you have a use case for. Do you want to do windows cross platform apps (windows, xbox, etc.)? Then you should probably learn C#. If you want to do android apps you should probably learn Java, Kotlin, Dart, JS, C#, or whatever you want. Essentially, my advice is to use python until you want to do something that is done easier in another language. Want to make an asynchronous backend for your sick website? Go is probably the best choice for that. Employers will hire people who are a good fit for what they do. If you try to get jobs working with Python you'll be fine, but if you learn another language you'll also show that you're capable of learning what is necessary.
Wow that video. I can't tell if this is satire or not.
Are you storing values as an int or a float?
Yeah i just noticed how bad the cuality got when it was rendered, i will post a pic rn hopefully with better quality 
The job market for Rust back-end developers is pretty much 0 compared to Java, Node, C#, or even Go if you're looking for a modern language. Rust is nice, but if the goal is to get hired, I don't think junior rust developer is a position many places are looking to fill.
Please don't. You need the /r/learnpython subreddit.
I don't mind it.
I didn’t even know that was a thing thanks lmao
Everything is stored as float except user input because it said couldn’t convert string to float idk why
You may find https://github.com/ryu577/pyray interesting.
beautiful soup is da bomb.
You could always do something like: number = int(input(“Enter a number: “))
OpenCV is free &amp; has facial recognition but it's not amazing. You can pay for a higher quality one. Try something like Kairos or Microsoft Cognitiive.
Agreed. His tutorials really helped me back then.
Thanks I’ll take a look at those. 
Use IDE's! You will thank yourself every day. I can't imagine not using one.
Thanks man that was it, my dumbass was dead set that it was input(int(“x”)) But ey thanks
You will.
It really depends what you mean with "graphics engine" here. If you hardware 2010 or later I would look into ModernGL (https://github.com/cprogrammer1994/ModernGL). It exposes a fairly simple api for using modern OpenGL 3.3+ features including geometry and compute shaders. It has an example folder with quite a few things. Alternatively you can also look at examples in the demosys-py project that is a simple framework over ModernGL https://github.com/Contraz/demosys-py Pyglet is a very stable and mature library, but it's pretty much stuck on OpenGL2.1. If you want compatibility and the extra features, use that. If you are looking for something more modern and high performance, go for ModernGL.
People love choices.
Honestly, instead of Django, I would try to learn Flask. Flask offers a little bit more flexibility in term of functionality. I use Postgres for all of my personal projects, and I have a lot of luck using sqlalchemy as an ORM. Flask does not have a database layer to its framework, so it allows you to use libraries such as these to their full potential. This is a good tutorial on how to start a basic Flask application: [https://pythonspot.com/flask-web-app-with-python/](https://pythonspot.com/flask-web-app-with-python/) This is a pretty good example of how to incorporate sqlalchemy into a flask application. it does a good job at explaining how to set up the basics, as well as how to utilize models for your tables: [https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-iv-database](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-iv-database)
Personally I use pycharm. It's good.
Actually, I don't think OpenCV does recognition (who is that?) out of the box. Just detection (is that a face?). Both paid services do.
Using [this](https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html) right now, pretty fun. Good luck you are basically gonna learn 2 languages at once. I reccomend a lite course on sqlite for some basic syntax, but it will get the job done. I reccomend figuring out how to store data from iexfinance which is a python import. ALSO YOUR EVIROMENT IS EVERYTHING! [Download this IDE, and learn how to use it](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
 Very much like Ruby's [Highline](https://github.com/JEG2/highline). *Very* cool. Thanks for bringing similar functionality over to our side!
Im convinced this is one of Trumps burner accounts.
Just so you know, you can use `clear` to clear your terminal before making a recording :-)
Whoa, that's a really neat idea... Who would've thought you could make the command line interface so user-friendly.
I support the claim that string handling was broken in python 2. The clear separation between `str` and `bytes` have made things a lot more elegant. This was one of the things most students on my class struggle with. Not to mention all the times byte data was returned as a `str`... and questions like "why does `str` have both `encode()` and `decode()`?"

Good work. I really like your project. 
At the couple jobs I've had, we generally don't use the pull request construct. Master is for the latest stable software version. Beta is the working branch, and contains code ready for the next stable version after a final qa test. Version branches, such as v1.4.0, are branched from beta and merged into master once ready. Changes can never be made directly in master. If a hotfix is made on v1.4.0, it's merged forward into master and back into beta. A version branches can only be merged forward to master if all unit tests and functional tests pass. Feature branches are pulled from beta and work completed and tested before being merged in to beta. It's the job of the developer that creates the feature branch to ensure unit tests are made for the feature, and that all unit tests pass before merging the feature branch back in to beta. We don't have a big enough team to afford the time to do code review (mainly because of management having a timeline differing from developers) so we depend on unit tests mainly. We do overlap fairly well though in our tasks, so we generally have a couple sets of eyes on most lines of code. We generally have the feature developer and another developer discuss more significant tasks to evaluate the approach, and this has worked well for us. I may try to bring in more structure though with more formal code review, more to ensure style is followed than anything 
VC Code normally. Some projects I use PyCharm because the code inspection is still superior there imho. For smaller things Atom or just plain vim is also fine.
It's not something that I use on my main computer but I just use it on my laptop since I can't be bothered to download another IDE.
Not really. I mostly see people having separate repo for compose stuff only having `Dockerfile` in the project itself. The project should only build a configurable image.
So my way of doing analysis (and to be clear, that's what I use notebooks for, not writing actual libraries or scripts which I'll do in a text editor or pycharm) is to write a cell that handles, say, reading the file. Then one that handles data cleanup of one type (e.g. some string cleanup). Then another for, say, datetime cleanup. Then do some filtering or aggregation. And so on. Now at some stage, I may realize 'oh, I missed this case when cleaning up my strings. I'll have to go fix that.' And it's very easy to update that cell and rerun the ones after it. Is there anything equivalent in ipython? Data analysis (at least the stuff I tend to do, in which every new task is a new data set and/or goal) usually means not knowing exactly what's in the data or how you're going to answer the question. So it's often rerunning a lot of code after minor tweaks. That's what is most appealing about notebooks in terms of actual programming (the output and Markdown and easy shareability etc. are all great too).
We use standardized SQL in SAS, so maybe I'd only have to learn 1.5 languages ;). 
Can I ask what kind of data you're exploring/what your typical workflow is? Because for me there is a lot of trial and error in figuring out how to properly parse, clean, and analyze the data and it's rare to get it right the first time. So if I discover an issue with a step, rerunning the code I need to is a pain. The counter to this might be write a .py file and rerun as needed. But there are often expensive steps (reading in data, notably) which I don't want to execute if I don't have to.
Perforce doesn't have pull requests. Yes in perforce you merge (integrate) branches into main but a bunch of your questions seemed to be related to the GitHub workflow and wasn't relevant to my work experience. Conflicts can still happen when two people edit the same file in the same place. I think that's a universal problem of SCM. Are you building a product to help with that ?
You have two choices. import the library in your dispatcher (usually bottle_app.py) and run it in the function connected to your route for that page. Or if you're using the template engine, just import in Python at the top of that page. The second version is probably better, as you only need that library in memory when that one page is running.
`import marauders_map`
Awesome I’ll check it out
Not for long! The next version of pyglet will have its core based on OpenGL 3.1 or 3.3. I'm working on this right now, and it's mostly done. The API will stay pretty much the same, and will include all the bells and whistles so that users don't need to know OpenGL to use it. Users will be free to access OpenGL directly, and easily experiment with shaders. 
&gt; Man is a warrior and woman should sit at home So, women should be working remotely from home while men mindlessly kill each other like savages? 
Nice. Will definitely check it out.
JSON - almost always. Computers and humans can parse it.
I have been doing this same thing for 3 years now, but from a home server. Doesn’t have to be complex. I use SQLITE3 databases, one for each symbol to store the “interesting” information that allows me to write queries and generate time histories very fast. The “interesting” information is what I find useful for the particular algorithms that I have written. I also store all the raw JSON data, just in case that I modify my definition of “interesting” in the future - which I’ve done a few times. To add new parameters to the databases, I just scan all the cache’d JSON files and add the parameters. Not only do I keep track of the fundamentals, but I keep track of option chains to identify candidate trades. Happy to share the database structure with you to give you a quick start. SQLITE3 is ubiquitous, so you can generate the databases in any language you want.
pyglet is a pure python graphics library, with no required dependencies. It uses OpenGL for rendering graphics, and contains native platform abstraction code for Linux, Mac and Windows. This includes things like windowing, mouse/keyboard/joystick input, audio etc. The ctypes module is used pretty heavily for accessing OS libraries and OpenGL. If there is a particular aspect of this that you're interested in, I'd be happy to point you towards the relevant parts of the code base. 
Not a game guy, but just some thoughts on the general idea: 1. From a purely economic perspective, do you want to be paying for compute resources simmering a cache for a player who is logged off and may never return? Assuming the worst case scenario and everyone logs off right now and never again returns, how long do you want to keep paying for all ex-players' caches? 2. Seems to me everything that's deterministic and can keep coasting while the player is offline is a thing that can be boiled down into a function that updates its state at the logoff tick to its new state at the logon tick -- basically every such thing is a point on some kind of curve that's running along the axis of time -- freezing a list of the state of those things at logoff and then foreword-winding that list at logon is going to get you to the same point as simmering the cache the entire time they were offline. A well-weighted priority queue on what of those items _needs_ to be brought up to now quickest in order to give the player the illusion of having never stopped is all that matters, right? The player's ability to experience multiple data points at once is quite limited, so for instance maybe their new position and vector and what's visible along that vector is more important than things outside their field of view while logging in. 3. If no amount of login lag is acceptable for the player you could put resources into calculating the odds of that player logging on at any given point, and then have the keep-warm loop backoff rapidly as those odds decrease, the start ticking over some buffer of time before the odds start increasing again. That would let you account for the player's sleep and work cycle, for instance.
There is code completion with no add-ons. It has some quirks but does the job. 
Ooh! Thanks!
Sure: no
Definitely pretty
Mostly correct. If this is Python 3 (haven't used Python2 so can't speak to its behavior), then print automatically terminates with a newline so you can just make the final print statement ``` print(f"{f} is the length of the arrow") # or print(f, "is the length of the arrow") ```
\&gt; it's very easy to update that cell and rerun the ones after it I usually use ipython running in console (not GUI), so no cells... when I need to rerun something there are few ways: select/paste; use shell history. History has option to use simple arrow up/down navigation - that is enough in about 80% of cases, another option is start typing and then use arrow up/down, that will reduce the navigation to only lines started from what I typed before, for example if I type `for` and press arrow-up will bring previous loop. So if I need redo `data = map(filter(....))` I type `da` arrow up and I have my line of code which I need to fix. The best things about ipython are code completion, data introspection (it is like running code in debugger), feedback on typing is instant and mostly I don't need to use mouse. Probably you can do most of those things in Notebook, I just don't why to use it, when I have ipython. &amp;#x200B;
It's much better than obscure, unmaintainable Excel macros.
TUI, all the way.
Reading this [definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_word)may help with your interest.
Given that he PMd me more of this redpill nonsense, I'm inclined to think this person actually believes what he writes. Troll accounts typically don't PM, as a 1 man audience isn't worth the effort. Given that the sentences are more or less coherent (even if the message isn't), I think this person isn't the current POTUS.
Which IMO is part of a more general statement about using SQLite for anything but the most trivial web development projects, even in development. There are so many potential pain points that it really isn't worth it in 2019 when it's pretty easy to spin up a Dockerized environment with Postgres. 
Not if you stick to the traditional definitions. Of course, if you decide to rename things any way you want, then they can be called whatever you want. But, a traditional name for this kind of structure in computer science is "vector". Think about it like this: 1. List is a data-structure with constant time insertion, deletion and derived operations, but it has linear time cost for random access. 2. Array is a data-structure with constant time random access, but linear time for insertion and deletion. 3. Vector is (typically) amortized constant time insertion deletion and random access ops (it's more like hash-table in this respect). "Lists" in Python aren't guaranteed to be allocated in a single chunk, so subscribing them isn't always a constant time op. They also have optimized insertion and deletion, which lead to this fragmentation I mentioned earlier. So, for all intents and purposes they are vectors.
Interesting, I’ve never used Perforce. Yes, I’m investing the idea of creating a developer tool to help reduce conflicts. 
No fancy data, usual CSVs, a bit of text and a bit of images. I don’t write plain .py files directly. I first play with a proper console and once I got what I was looking for I write it properly in a .py role
Why don’t you like the QtConsole ? Same as IPython but some plots inline. 
So you’re saying that apart from markdown and visual aspects, the main advantage is having the possibility to go back on what you’ve made before and just rerun the cell you edited ? I welcome you in the hell of cells. If you do that and somehow forget to run the cell. Or forget to run the following cells that modifies the data you just edited. Or you delete a variable you were printing, and the printing still works ! Because the variable is still there, just never assigned before and you don’t see it anymore. Or ... Once you edit a before, if you want to be absolutely sure there’s no side effect, you have to restart the kernel (it cleans all variables in locals and globals) and rerun it all. 
Thanks for the tip. I've been using the free version both Pycharm and IntelliJ for a year now. I'm now set up with the professional version.
You’re the first one actually providing arguments ! I kinda agree with you, using notebooks for code presentation/data presentation is almost great. I’m used to do my LaTeX but I can see why people prefer notebooks. You talked about things I don’t like in notebooks in a positive way. You said you dropped some code in .py files. That’s why I would do and that’s what I did for almost all the code, except printing/plotting. Then that’s just plain data presentation. But the problem is most of people don’t do that. And when you want to reuse their code it’s a pain in the ass. Especially if those people tried to put some code in .py files or in another notebook or whatever crazy bad workflow they had. But I got you, there’s positive experiences. And please don’t tell others I already had such a good experience. It just happened once or twice though, compared to tens of bad ones. 
You may be able to use one of the EBML libraries if Im not mistaken.
The time queue of actions is a good methodology if the game has any kind of complexity. Your table is indexed on the time when an action will have effect and you simple run a loop which consumes actions as they expire (in order), or sleeps there are no expired actions. The action should be computed as if it occurred when it actually expired. If it's a multiplayer game where actions of one player can affect an other; like mining an asteroid will deplete it so an other player can't mine it, then you simply need to run this loop at all times. If it's a single player game (or actions don't affect other players) then you can simply run the same loop but only when the player is online. If it takes more than a few seconds to consume the actions then you're probably doing something wrong. But with this queue you can always run the loop for a player every now and then so it'll be mostly consumed when the player logs on. Using a time queue of actions and calculating actions as if they occurred on the correct time allows you to deal with any kind of complexity (except time travel) and it also allows you to run the game in several different ways (and even combine them) like "always", "periodic" and "on demand" (login) depending on what suits your game.
Sorry dude but I know the link you provided and it’s just a disaster to use. You can’t code properly in .py files when importing notebooks because you have to go read the notebooks in a browser which lack of all IDE’s tools for code. The unmaintainable part, I answered somewhere, is because you’re invited to edit previous cells without checking if following cells are still working. You might delete a cell, stuff still works and when you rester, tada it doesn’t work. I can understand that people not coming from CS background need to code. But they should take some software engineering courses. When you want to use a tool you don’t know, you better ask people doing this as a job how to do. Taking shortcuts is usually not a good idea. So for a super basic thing I have to install new modules, go to options and check some boxes ? The console already do this ! 
I'd use FFMPEG to add or change metadata. You can just run it from Python with generated command line parameters. 
python is a scripting language. it's a fact

Python: There should be one obvious way to do it… …unless “it” is dependency management, in which case there should be a new way every week.
They're not free, but Team Treehouse and Dataquest.io have good python courses with similar in browser interfaces. If CodeAcademy is still teaching Python2 I would be suspicious of the quality of their course.
Thats cool. Since Medium sucks in terma of code snippets, use gists ;)
Naming the dependency file "package.json" is an atrocious idea given that that's already a well-known name in the JS dev community. Good luck with IDEs breaking…
Isn’t OpenGL a non-python library?
There is no reason to bring whole new dependency for a few lines of code. Remembers me Javascript these days...
And any project that happens to use both languages would make for exciting times
I was literally, working on a project today, thinking "man, I could use something to make command line UI's easier." This is a god send. Thank you so much! 
I recommend learning other languages. Not because Python isn't good enough, but because 1) learning is fun 2) learning other programming languages helps you become a better Python programmer. Different programming languages require different ways of thinking, of looking at problems and even at the nature of computing itself. I've been programming in Python for over a decade. During that time I've learned Lua, JavaScript, bash and a little bit of Rust, C, C++, Ruby, Lisp, Forth, Haskell, Clean and probably some others I can't think of right now. Each language has given me new insights into language design, algorithms, quality control etc. No matter you want to make, Python will remain to be a useful tool in your toolbox.
I've been meaning to create a package that when installed by \`\`pip\`\`, downloads and installs \`pipenv\`, which in turn triggers \`poetry\`, which will use a custom build step to install \`flit\`, which will download \`pip\` again. It will continue to install itself in every possible way until the situation improves.
Yes, OpenGL is part of the graphics driver stack. 
I'm using git, but I'm mostly working by myself. On the few projects where I work with someone else, we are using a hub-and-spoke `svn`-like model. No pull/merge requests. All branches are local.
You do need a return in that last one (before they try copying it).
I mean that means it's not in UTF-8 if it has to convert to it, right?
The file isn't in utf-8 but IDLE converts it to utf-8 when you open it
Here is what I got : b'#!c:\\\\users\\\\\\xec\\xdc\\xed\\xef\\xf2\\\\appdata\\\\local'
Right, but unless you save the file in UTF-8, it will stay in another encoding.
Also the first time I open the file after installing pyinstaller I [get a message](https://github.com/m1233/Error/blob/master/idle_message.png) The entry that you will see is already filled by IDLE. I didn't type anything. &amp;#x200B;

FYI, I really recommend `poetry`. Easy, clean, play nice with other tools, workflow. I'm tired of resolve dependency conflict in `pipenv`, also, the new version of `poetry` give the ability to export lock file back to `requirements.txt`, which is amazing for backward compatibility. So, IMO, I don't see why we need &lt;yet another tool for dependency management&gt;.
So that tells me that the first version of the file that you uploaded was the correct one. The suspicions that I laid out are probably accurate too. As I said; this file is encoded in iso8859-7 and python doesn't know how to read it as it is. I found these two bugs which seem to be about your issue: * https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/1246 * https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/5539 There's a workaround mentioned in the second one where you install pyinstaller indirectly by running `pip wheel pyinstaller` to create a .whl file and then install that file with `pip install path-to-the-file.whl`. I would recommend trying that. If you run into trouble please post the entire terminal output of all the commands you ran that session.
This. poetry is also waaaaaaaaaay faster than pipenv for some reason and feels overall more polished.
&gt; dependency management not to mention version management

Hi!, Thanks for the response, I am looking for the portion of code where it is rendering the objects on the screen. 
You don't have the wheel package installed. Run `pip install wheel` and try again.
It may be useful to get some historical context and learn more about where Jupiter Book is coming from and why such tools are used, i.e. [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming). If your local library carries some of Knuth's literate works I recommend that you at least browse them.
**Literate programming** Literate programming is a programming paradigm introduced by Donald Knuth in which a program is given as an explanation of the program logic in a natural language, such as English, interspersed with snippets of macros and traditional source code, from which a compilable source code can be generated.The literate programming paradigm, as conceived by Knuth, represents a move away from writing programs in the manner and order imposed by the computer, and instead enables programmers to develop programs in the order demanded by the logic and flow of their thoughts. Literate programs are written as an uninterrupted exposition of logic in an ordinary human language, much like the text of an essay, in which macros are included to hide abstractions and traditional source code. Literate programming (LP) tools are used to obtain two representations from a literate source file: one suitable for further compilation or execution by a computer, the "tangled" code, and another for viewing as formatted documentation, which is said to be "woven" from the literate source. While the first generation of literate programming tools were computer language-specific, the later ones are language-agnostic and exist above the programming languages. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

Yea, and what if you have JavaScript and Python in the same project? This idea feels very autistic.
Ok. So, I created the wheel, I installed it with no problems but when trying to create the executable I got [another](https://github.com/m1233/Error/blob/master/error) error. Sorry for all of this :c
What version of setuptools do you have? You can run `pip show setuptools` to find out.
No one seems to have recommended to learn databases/ sql. Which is essential in most backend development projects.
On top of that it's just an atrocious format to edit and read. 
Version 28.8.0
No-one writes bare metal code in Python. Pyglet allows you call OpenGL from python without additional dependency, but all it does is invoke OpenGL render command. Actual pixel drawing is done inside OpenGL. Look at pyglet/gl/gl.py and you will see how it maps python to openGL C code in gl.h (a system library).
Can poetry create a virtual environment for your project? I liked that feature in pipenv. If yes, I'll give poetry a try.
Uh, /u/mipadi is right, but I call bullshit on this. I like argparse for small scripts or anything that just does a single thing with minor options, but it is no scalable way of building anything remotely advanced as a command line app. [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/) is just far, far more superior. Good luck building something like the git CLI using argparse and not going insane in the process.
Yeah, that's pretty old. Run `pip install --upgrade setuptools`. Then you should be able to continue with your `pyinstaller george_abc.py`.
Yep, it does. 
&gt;pip install --upgrade setuptools Well, finally it worked. For some reason it can't open a .png image but the main issue was solved. Thanks for all the help! Your karma should double tbh.
Not everything that looks like a function is actually a function. ``` &gt;&gt;&gt; help(enumerate) Help on class enumerate in module builtins: class enumerate(object) | enumerate(iterable[, start]) -&gt; iterator for index, value of iterable | | Return an enumerate object. iterable must be another object that supports | iteration. The enumerate object yields pairs containing a count (from | start, which defaults to zero) and a value yielded by the iterable argument. | enumerate is useful for obtaining an indexed list: | (0, seq[0]), (1, seq[1]), (2, seq[2]), ... ``` Notice how this says `class enumerate(object)`. It's a _class_, not a function.
Isinstance is your guy. Check the link for reference https://stackoverflow.com/questions/152580/whats-the-canonical-way-to-check-for-type-in-python
I've tried that but my teacher said that we are not allowed to use any built-in functions... I know... stupid...
My project was Python CLI so no WEB there. Sqlite did the trick for most of the things I needed
Use try-except. def get_speed(): while True: try: return int(input('input speed: ')) except ValueError: print('invalid speed')
One way of checking for correct data type might be with the try statement. Hope it helps... &amp;#x200B; user_input = input("Write something &gt; ") try: #Try to convert to an integer. int_user_input = int(user_input) print(type(int_user_input)) except Exception as e: print(e, " user input is not an int")
Still better than XML.
I've just published https://github.com/gabdube/panic-panda with no dependencies The bulk of the rendering logic is in this file: https://github.com/gabdube/panic-panda/blob/master/src/engine/data_components/data_scene.py 
Will this work when input() always returns a string?
Your description of the solution in your edit sounds very intriguing, I have come to the same conclusion as a good approach, but i'm not as far along as you are. I would be very interested in how you did the interaction in your pyqt function, as I think dynamically evolving models are the way to go. Thanks for being a pioneer in this !!
just tried it. Doesn't work :) &amp;#x200B;

Hi. Python is a cool language but it is a tool (very powerful today). So what really means for a job opportunity is what you can do with python. If you can develop a web app you will be hired by company who need a web developer, if you know how to analyze data with help of python you will be hired by another company and so on. So my advice is to improve your skills in some speciality rather than in a language. About knowledge of other language: if you learn language with different paradigm (Java, Clojure) you can bring some new ideas from this languages to Python. And it definitely give you more understanding about Python language design decisions. Do my advice here is to try another language.
Don’t understand how could you miss it, just hit Tab while typing e.g. some class method or func. Important thing: using module must be imported already that’s why people usually import everything in the first cell, run it, and right after that autocomplete works fine. 
Gee helpfull
What if you do a raw string so r"path here"
&gt; So my way of doing analysis (and to be clear, that's what I use notebooks for, not writing actual libraries or scripts which I'll do in a text editor or pycharm) is to write a cell that handles, say, reading the file. Then one that handles data cleanup of one type (e.g. some string cleanup). Then another for, say, datetime cleanup. Then do some filtering or aggregation. And so on. &gt; Is there anything equivalent in ipython? Personally I do exactly this for dat analysis, except that instead of writing a cell I write a function in a file, which can be reloaded in the ipython shell when necessary. For things that need some experimentation, I may test everything first in the shell before writing up the function, since that's more convenient than reloading repeatedly after many small changes. I think this probably works out pretty similar to notebook style development, but I never got used to the notebooks and find that maintaining a module of functions works better for me.
Windows? Their filename encoding isn't unicode. I don't know how to make it work on Windows but I can tell it's probably the reason that's not working.
I have used OpenCV and I got it to a point where it would recognise me and other colleagues. It is harder to train as it required more than 30 images when training using the LBPH face recogniser but if you are willing to spend the time it can do the job. Can't comment on the others as I haven't used them.
Which OS is this? Maybe the OS locale is not utf8? &gt;&gt;&gt; os.environ['LC_ALL'] 'C.UTF-8' 
It feels autistic? 
YAML is for Python, JSON is for JavaScript. XML is for nobody.
@op did you try this? 
Im on OSX, But you led me to the answare.. I had draged the file to the terminal to get the path, then copyed it.. Wich includes backslash \ before spaces.. Didnt think of it. Thanks! 
i found the solution, see my edit in post. Thanks!
i found the solution, see my edit in post. Thanks!
It's readable if you use whitespace
Hi, looks like you may have gotten lost **again**... &amp;#x200B; try /r/learnpython &amp;#x200B;
if you want Unicode out, put Unicode in: os.listdir(u"some/unicode/path") ^ put a u before the path string. Hope it helps. 
Looks like you don't have cmake. There are some good tutorials on pyimagesearch for setting up tools for image processing / deep learning 
Autocomplete is annoying for some reason and startup time long. On other hand I use console build-in in Spyder, which is Qt. I usually do some sort of data processing and I don' need graphics - qt console doesn't provide any advantage unless I use pyplot, but for that I prefer to run program from console as pure python script.
The console you're talking about is the "Jupyter Qtconsole" which is great and is just a windowed version of IPython. You could try better IDEs like PyCharm, VSCode, Atom, SublimeText...
No need to call Java folks "nobody"!
It's the 'just' part that I have a problem with. Also, the technical differentiation is compiled, and py files are compiled to pyc before running.
Released v1.0 with some shield badges and python 3 support of RestResponse. Project aims to be a fluent python object for working with JSON apis https://github.com/tysonholub/RestResponse

Thanks for this! I wrote today a little tool (https://github.com/jabbalaci/pdfmanip) that is based on this library. With pdfmanip you can remove pages from a PDF easily.
That's a very autistic thing to say
I switched over to using LXD/LXC to manage all my python projects and got away from all the virtualenv, pipenv, poetry, etc. 
Ha ha ha

I took a similar course from edx.org which was powered by datacamp which was my first online course. It helped me a lot
The above is actually the historical context in the computer science community. For learning about Jupiter Notebook's motivations and use cases in the science community it's better to read the [historical perspective by Fernando Pérez](http://blog.fperez.org/2012/01/ipython-notebook-historical.html), the creator of IPython and Jupiter Notebook.
????? asking for advice where I am stuck is not cheating???
if you're just going to be a useless internet troll, dont bother. 
right you are :-) edited
Thanks.
&gt; now I'm trying to figure out the best way to, for lack of a better term, organize and visualize the results You may want to look into [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for the statistical analysis and matplotlib or [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) for the plotting.
This is cool! Thank you a lot, I've been using some shitty and probably unsafe websites for too long
No problem. Just so you're aware the raw string (with an r before the quotation) gives you the same result without needing to enter the backslashes. If for example I wanted to place {} in my string, python thinks this is reserved for something else so hides them when I print the string. Using the back slashes tells python that it actually IS part of the string. Making it a raw string has the same effect without all the slashes. If, for example, you decide to make your script interactive and ask the user for a path it would be better to accept the input as a raw string or they will have to type the slashes in order to get a result. 😊
The point was that argparse is bad enough to make everyone else want to make a better one (including the people who don't want to use click, either). [Here's](https://gist.github.com/supposedly/01224262b816df21b601ab0784d5f999) what they were talking about — totally "one, and only one obvious way"
Also see pdftk
You can use subprocess to call commandline tools that do it.
I have no experience with it, but heard of Kivy. That might work for you.
You probably want to look at [Kivy](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/guide/packaging-android.html) which uses [python for android](https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android)
*cries in c#*
Is there a yaml parser in the STD ? If not I'd prefer json. Currently there's only pyyaml, but as I said, it's not in the STD.
Oh this sounds like fun. If you’re ever looking for some help I’d love to add some stuff 
You still need to manage your dependencies though. Containers don't magically make this easier. They just remove the absolute necessity of a venv. You still need to be able to ensure when you build your webapp you get Flask 1.0.1 instead of maybe Flask 1.1
From a performance perspective I suspect you will want to move from `ctypes` into writing a c-extension wrapper. Also you might get a bit of traction if you support embedding in PySide2, as you would probably be one of the first to do so: https://blog.qt.io/blog/2017/06/06/vulkan-support-qt-5-10-part-1/ Are you aware that your name is close to that of the `panda3d` package?
&gt; git have the same concepts of pull/merge request Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket have the concept of pull/merge request. `git` itself doesn't. The closest you get in pure git is [`git send-email`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-send-email).
hello, the reason I don’t run this project local is that, I manage it with a friend :) The project is run in google cloud / azure cloud. are you running SQLite 3 with sql alchemy library / append?
That looks very interesting, because &lt;3 Vulkan &amp;&amp; &lt;3 Python. You might wanna crosspost this to r/gamedev :-)
Beeware or Kivy. 
You are correct. I was thinking more of repository service providers and not the tool itself. 
Why wouldn’t get exactly the same version when I deploy? I simply take a snapshot and export the container to my server that also runs LXD
This is one of those situations where Python may not be the best tool for the job. Unity is really great for learning game development, and C# isn't terrible to learn coming from Python. If you definitely want to make that app in Python, go right ahead. Be careful not to limit yourself to one language though. Things got a lot easier for me once I started considering what would be the best programming language for each project I set out on.
XML is pretty much contained to EE in the Java world, thank god.
TL;DR : JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, and Go are fast-frowning and/or too important to ignore. Good choices for languages to learn in 2019, if you don’t know them.
In fact, it’s a major part of being a smart developer. I tried to do this one project in PHP, because it allowed rapid application development for the project in question. The problem is - it felt off. It was a language learning product. I had used Django and Python previously, but many years ago and knew it would take me extra time to come to speed on them so I chose against it. When the project was near beta, I realized that I was being an idiot. Took a month, rewrote it in Python. Incredibly smart decision. Python was the right language for the project.
I want to make an app that involves audio files-sort of like a Playlist creator. Would python be able to do this, or should I use JAVA instead?
Eaxctly, you make a decision thinking it will be easier but you're just making more work for yourself. Plus, it's pretty fun seeing all the advantages and quirks of other frameworks/languages!
The Python community can borrow ideas from other languages. If someone likes functional paradigm and prefers Python, this library can be very useful.
Exactly. And I can integrate a ton of useful ML/NLP libraries directly into my project without having to create a micro service that processes it and returns it (or even worse, replicating all that functionality in PHP). It really simplifies a lot, ultimately. But for OP, I’d probably say C# and Unity are his best path forward
I’m glad you found some value in my post, I didn’t set out to write as much as I did. It sounds like your main issues are not with notebooks themselves, but working with others in notebooks. While I took over the notebook I worked on from someone else, the co-authoring basically ended there, and I could see how working with others who aren’t diligent could lead to headaches. That said, that could apply to just about everything. As I mentioned, I’ve worked with devs who were used to C++ who have hated working in Python because they felt it lead to bad habits and they missed having the safety net of a compiler, but there are great Pythonic solutions to these issues. We have a git repo dedicated to work in notebooks, which has access to our internal libraries and external libraries. We still expect to put notebooks through code review and work has to be approved before it can be merged and published. The process isn’t as tightly controlled as publishing to our reporting platform, but it’s enough to increase the quality of code to a fairly high level. If you don’t have a process like this in place, I’d recommend suggesting one to your team and management. It shouldn’t be hard, these are conventional best practices, and if you do get push back against such a suggestion, I’d feel like that is a larger issue than the notebooks themselves. Once you have a good code review process in place, you can focus on what you find as the largest pain points. Making use of PR templates and CI services can help the developers and reviewers achieve a high level of end product. If you are seeing duplicated code, ask to take some time to refactor it into a reusable, documented, and testable library. If your teammates and management are anything but ecstatic about this prospect, I’d be very surprised. I’d be happy to discuss the issues you’ve experience and potential solutions further. As I mentioned, I’m not a data scientist and do not often work in notebooks, so it’s a learning experience for me, too. I’ve just applied what I know from working on back-end applications and services to notebooks, and simply treat them as a presentation tool with the benefits of a good console/shell. If I was noodling around in my usual console and made something interesting or useful, I wouldn’t check in a dump of the console expecting it to be merged into master without a heavy refactoring, and I treated the notebook the same. Thanks for reading!
Because time. You need to update your modules.
I'm gonna have to defer to someone more experienced to answer that, I've never developed mobile apps besides a few GearVR tests. The problem I see with using Python for this is not really to do with what the app does, just that Python isn't really meant for writing native applications. If Java's the standard Android dev language, it may be worth learning! It'll be tough at first but there should be more resources and people to help because it's so widely used. Plus, Java is an incredibly widely used language so you'll be able to use it for a ton of other things. Those are just my opinions though, I'm really not very experienced on this particular topic 
Why? There is already a way to do it: https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#configuring-setup-using-setup-cfg-files Define the top dependencies in `install_requires`. When you want to generate "lock" you use `pip freeze`, when you want install use `pip install`. Or better, use `pip-compile` and `pip-sync` from `pip-tools` package. This integrates really well with SCM such as salt, chef, ansible etc. You only need the "lock" if you want to make sure that you use exact same packages between devint, qa, staging and prod deployments.
Not the OP, but that’s pretty awesome, I didn’t know that. I’ll have to look into that further; if you can mix Python and latex that would be really useful! Thanks for the tip!
 Try python 
Yeah, it makes describing models and algorithms way easier. See this link for more tips and tricks! https://link.medium.com/Pi4YXQYfgT
From my experience argparse is actually fine. I started using docopt it was actually not bad, but only could handle simple cases. I then tried Click it felt superior at first, but it stroke my nerve that author added his own Unicode bias into the tool, so I simply went back to argparse. And you know what? It was pretty much the same number of lines as in Click. It can do everything Click does (Click actually uses argparse under the hood), so why adding an extra dependency?
Check the docs where it is listed under built-in functions: [https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate) &amp;#x200B; What this function does is to return an enumerate object, this is what you refer to.
This subreddit has not video tutorials
It's never been pleasant to edit though.
Oh I see, thanks. 
That is a great little article, thank you for sharing! I'm not sure what some of the extensions do yet, but based on names like Initialization cells, ExecuteTime, and Comment/Uncomment Hotkey, I am very excited to make use of this!
That's totally fair. Depending on your needs argparse has a chance at being a headache, but if that's not you then there's no reason to add a third-party dependency. &gt; (Click actually uses argparse under the hood) It used to use optparse under the hood, not argparse, but since v2.x it's been using its own parser.
It depends.
&gt; I prefer reading on paper, so I print a lot. You can choose which pages you want to print... This seems like a pointless tool.
Godot has GDScript, a Python inspired language. There is a third party module to use Python as a scripting language, but I think it might be difficult getting that to word on Android
Python is probably able to do that, but you should use Java or Kotlin instead. Java and Kotlin are officially supported by Android. The vast majority of guides both official and unofficial will provide examples in Java and/or Kotlin.

If you are outside Israel and considering going or speaking at an event like this, please consider heeding the Palestinian call for the world to boycott Israel and support non-violent resistance to Israeli occupation: [https://bdsmovement.net/what-is-bds](https://bdsmovement.net/what-is-bds) &amp;#x200B; Going to events like these in Israel legitimizes its colonization and oppression of Palestinian peoples in West Bank, Gaza, and inside Israel proper.

When you build a new container and Flask has upgraded you'll get that new version rather than the old version. Dependency management also deals in things like Foo wants Qux 1.2 and Bar wants Qux &gt;= 1.2, how does it figure out what to do (in this case it's obvious but other cases are much more complicated)
Do you know how poetry compares to conda? Can I use it to manage anaconda environments?
Locking is a must have in a production environment. If you want your test environment to mean something about production - then you need to reproduce that locked version elsewhere in a reliable fashion. Locking is a requirement for dependency management.
No, enumerate() is the constructor for the enumerate class. It's also in the help text. The fact that you think otherwise, only based on the URL, tells me that you should probably spend am little less time trying to explain things.
Well every tool has three purposes: the fun of making something, the learning associated with making something, and the joy of something existing. I thought that perhaps this tool was useful for those who want to avoid gui ("sigh, click, sigh, click, sigh deeply, click"). However, it does look like the `lp` command accepts a page like `-P`; this might be easier to use for quite a few use cases. Although, I can't seem to work out how to get `lp` to *preview* the file before printing so that's a use - cut some pages from the command line and preview before printing. As tengerinelion points out above pdftk is an alternative. Some advantages of using the command line: composibility, repeatability ( "up enter"), shareability, less mode switching. 
&gt; fast-frowning :( 
That link have been ~~spammed~~several times already, so use the search function. 
This is cool. Might look at using this as a base to generate png’s for project planning. Most decent planning tools are paid that create visual overview... was looking at one recently that I wanted to recreate in Python: https://www.officetimeline.com/ that we use at work.
I’m a noob to python but I made a project that does multiplication
I’m not building a new container. I’m snapshotting mine that I developed on and deploying that to my server. 
What do you mean? The deploy matches my development environment because it’s literally a snapshot of it. 
Try saving it and then using glob variable search for the file and rename it. Glob is your ally
 camera.start\_recording('/home/pi/Videos/video'+str(v)'.h264')
when i do that i get a sytax error on the last ' in ...264')
how would i do that?
Does office timeline create a PNG or actual PowerPoint shapes that you can modify in the slides later? Seems like the latter may be more useful 
Install gentoo.
&gt;ESC ill give it a go
ok Ill have a look at some other studs thanks!
That's what I said, to create lock I just use `pip-compile` and to deploy use `pip-sync` those work really well with SCM. 
ruamel.yaml
Yay, these pop up like JS frameworks.
Not in the batteries
"currently there's only pyyaml"
So it depends on what you're setup is. You might want to implement a way to check to see if a filename already exists as well. But you also need a way to keep track of which variables you've already used to add on the end of the video file name. I would recommend using the current date and time as that would almost always work. from datetime import datetime camera.start_recording('/home/pi/Videos/video_' + datetime.now().strftime('%m-%d-%y_%H:%M:%S') + '.h264') This will output: /home/pi/Videos/video_01-06-18_12:30:30.h264
The page says it's Linux only. I wonder why, since Python is cross-platform.
Pointless for you, useful for me. I've wanted such a tool for a long time but I could never force myself to actually write it. If you want to keep the PDF after printing, this tool has an advantage.
I know about pdftk. If you have an 8 pages long PDF, how do you create a new PDF out of the 1st, 3rd, 7th and 8th pages? What does it look like with pdftk?
I struggled with getting into python because of this. From Ruby (bundler) and JavaScript (npm/yarn) python didn’t really “click” for me. 
That seems like a great way to inadvertently leak development-only stuff to Production.
I use some Linux-specific external calls. As I'll only use it on Linux, I didn't bother with other platforms.
Something like this `pdftk in.pdf cat 1 3 7 8 output out1.pdf`
Also see ghostscript! 
Sorry, I don't have time to do a code review right now. Although a good way of keeping your code clean yourself is to ryn pylint to make sure you are following best practices.
I don't want to be a cunt but trying to always use python for stuff is sometimes silly, on Linux, you'd be far better off using pdftk or ghostscript even if you called it from the subprocess module. Mostly because of the fact that they can do far more than select pages from pdfs. 
My problem with pdftk is that I always forget the correct usage and order of parameters. That's why I wrote an interactive tool with a built-in help. All I need to memorize is the name of the script. But fine, pdftk could also do it.
It’s an image, but to gen the image you use text inputs. To modify the graph, you must change these inputs. They don’t dynamically move around in real-time. At least, I haven’t seen it possible.
&gt; I don't want to be a cunt but It's OK. If I want to extend this program in the future and I need something that the chosen library cannot do, I'll start using pdftk too. At the moment all I needed was the ability to remove some given pages.
Starting them young. Fantastic. May we have a future programmer here!
thanks very much
And that would be amazing, pdf tools are very weak in python, good luck! 
fixed it now - was missing the 2nd +
Why is it a problem of oversaturation if things just exist? The problem /u/mipadi is talking about stems from dependency management being something *every Python developer* has a problem with, because it affects the language at its core. Is it a problem if there's many CLI frameworks developed? No, not any more than it is a problem if there's multiple web frameworks, or UI frameworks, or datetime libraries, or whatever. It's just code; ideas used for iteration. dotlock's *existence* isn't a problem, although if it gains steam it might well become one. But you don't get to just forbid people from iterating on existing concepts. As for click, I linked it because it's an example of a high quality framework which can do things argparse just cannot. Namely, it lets you build a usable multilevel CLI app without going through a ton of useless code and boilerplate. As to /u/CSI_Tech_Dept's experience, I'd say that any app where click / argparse have roughly the same amount of LOCs is probably not complex enough for Click. You can still use it for that if you prefer (or if you intend to make it more complex in the future), but there is *no world* in which it's as easy to build high quality verb-driven cli apps (like git, svn, etc) with argparse as it is with Click. I can't speak for libraries I haven't used, and I'm not saying click is *specifically* the best; it's just miles better and happens to have a solid community behind it.
you can put comments in xml, can't do that in json
A friend of mine is trying this right now via youtube that you might get some ideas from. She found most tutorials left out pieces or didn't dig in enough, so a few months ago she started to make her own. [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3GwY94HuU3MWkuUUirHCtQ/videos?flow=grid&amp;sort=p&amp;view=0](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3GwY94HuU3MWkuUUirHCtQ/videos?flow=grid&amp;sort=p&amp;view=0)
Okay
Google rename files with glob and os. Sorry for not giving something else I am on the phone
Thanks
thats ok. i've fixed the problem now
Nice object you got there
I know that ctypes is pretty much the worst possible solution if we are looking a speed, but it's easy to use and built-in. The speed is not that important in the project anyway. Embedding directly in Qt/PySide could be interesting. I'll look into it. I didn't think about `panda3d`. I think the names are different enough tough. 
Will do
Sorry, was on holiday. That's the point. With venvs, where you normally wouldn't have a registry entry, on a general install you do. But now that the binaries are links to the normal ones, you might screw yourself over if any of the registry entries end up applying to the venv which previously you wouldn't want to. For example (and this would have to be crafted by some IT admin via some policy editor), the true install could be located out of the user's workspace but because of a registry entry not allowed to be modified or deleted. When making a venv and later wanting to delete it, removing a link and deleting a file are two different things in windows, and when attempting to remove the venv you might end up trying to delete it rather than remove the link. Which you then can't do because of policy.
I'm interested! What are you doing, exactly?
its basically done now, just want to make it useable as a command line tool [https://github.com/kevin-nel/YourTube](https://github.com/kevin-nel/YourTube) &amp;#x200B;
You clearly have never used ipynb in a professional setting. Telling non-coders to take software engineering classes is completely pointless when they can accomplish everything that they need to without them. And yes, you have to run two console commands to install one module and check a box (10 seconds) in order to add this one bit of functionality. Did you read/understand the console commands? you are downloading and installing one module. Other IDE's aren't perfect out of the box either, sublime requires the package manager, VSCode needs dark mode, etc. &amp;#x200B; Again, it seems like you are just on here to argue or get validation from others on your point. Notebooks may not be perfect for your specific needs, but they are the superior tool for a lot of work that goes on in python. 
And that's how mafia works..... Ps: does anyone know any good video series for flow control statements like elif 
It's takes class to make a comment like this. 
And good orientation ofcourse
So your production runs with DEBUG=1 and shows every sensitive data when something crashes?
Have you taken a look at python-pptx module [https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart.html](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart.html) ? I wonder if creating a static image is the best way, or to use an API like above to create e.g. a Gantt chart using Power Point shapes just like office timeline does it
What if the paper I want to scan isn't square?
Yes you can make one in Python and no you shouldn't hire someone. You said this is a school project. The point is to learn something....... Put the effort in. 
Find a square paper

Usually you make it conditional on an environment variable.
It's detailed!
But then you need to have network access in production. One alternative is to generate a bundle that includes all dependencies that were tested with, e.g. [pex](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex), and send that to production.
Is there any particular reason that you use recordtype? I've never heard of it before but the pypi listing starts with &gt;I have switched active development to my namedlist project. ...It should be fully compatible with recordtype. It appears to me that since you don't use the default value functionality of recordtype, you could just use collections.namedtuple, and avoid the dependency.
Looks nice. Here is a similar project I use. Maybe if there is enough overlap you could merge them and the efforts: [https://bitbucket.org/astanin/python-tabulate/src/master/](https://bitbucket.org/astanin/python-tabulate/src/master/)
You didn't call the function 
You should try running the program through the regular windows command line with `py (filename)`. Better question: why are you using a serif font in your editor?
You are defining a function but not calling it, try to write (on the 5th line outside the scope of the function) displayIntro() and you will see the output
You define function but never call it. Put displayIntro() at the end
You should show them the Turtle module, then they can paint with Python.

the first thing wrong is that you are using a sherif font the real thing wrong, is that you havent *called* the function. When you write `def displayIntro():` and the lines below (the body of the function), you only *define* that function, to actually run the code inside you have to *call* that function. To call a function, you write `[function name]()` (in this case `displayIntro()` in the part of the code where you want the function to actually run.

Please change font ... And call the function 
`namedtuple` is immutable and I needed a mutable data type so I followed the suggestion in [this stackoverflow answer.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31253184/4057608) But I didn't see the disclaimer in the pypi page so I think I'm going to switch to `namedlist` for now. I'm not a fan of the extra dependency either but I think it's not really a big deal. Anyway thanks for the feedback!
+1 Nice and simple. I'm looking for something that visually maps my sleep monitor (ala fitbit but DIY) into time bars. This will work. I'd prefer json input vs. text, but that's a simple enough mod I can make. 
Savage!
Hey you declared the function but you didn't call it, your code says "Make this function" but theres no "use this function" So the correct code is as follows: ` import time import random def displayIntro(): print("SomeText") displayIntro() `
Today I just realized the Python symbol is a blue and yellow snake in the shape of a cross. Wtf brain

Looks good. Column options to wrap or truncate long entries at *n* characters would be great.
What was your knowledge level with Python before you read either book? Beginner?Moderately comfortable? I'm a beginner with Python but I have feeling Ill want a good reference when I get to the more difficult stuff. Where I struggle with learning a new coding language is how to implement it into real life applications. 
/r/learnpython
love pyenv, I leave a requirements.txt in my git repos and use a pyenv Dockerfile, then it installs it directly, it is then just a string var change from '2.7.15' to '3.7.2' The best with pyenv is \`pyenv update\` and \`pyenv install &lt;version&gt;\` and \`pyenv virtualenv &lt;version&gt; &lt;myname&gt;\` in 3 lines you initialized your environment and ready for requirements.txt, when you always start from scratch it is easy to solve dependencies. The pain is installing dependencies like kafka, websphere mq, mssql, oracle, db2 etc, but nothing solves this better than docker, application isolation makes it easy to know what ports need to be open and what subsystems need to be installed. I see the need of poetry if you have a complex setup which is shared among various application and one upgrade may break another. But I like to break it all down to smallest possible business units as possible, This also makes it easier to upgrade single components. like all apps use the same apache wcgi/flask rest api for authentication. This is totally isolated and can be load balanced and version-controlled. For any developer this is easily accessible swagger documented, just to add a few lines to you own rest api.
Haha... yeah. The point is, that it doesnt matter for the user if it is a class, it is implemented in a way that it feels like a function - and this is why it is named built-in function in the offical Python docs.
Thanks! I wasn't sure if I was supposed to post it here or on r/LearnPython. I just posted it here since it the r/Python subreddit has more followerd. I'll keep that in mind!
Lol yeah but this is kinda ridiculus
thanks! I'll have a deeper look. I am writing it using Python 3.6 features as I pick them up (type annotations, f-strings etc), so it might be a bit hard to contribute, but I'll have a look. From a first glance, it seems pretty rich, but its API is is structured a bit differently - all formatting options are passed during print(tabulate(existing data structure, options....)), while I prefer to have the data and formatting separated: out = NiceTable(['Layout', 'Description']) for layout in NiceTable.builtin_layouts(): out.append(layout) print(out) Anyway, thanks for the pointer! If you a few minutes to try it, will love to hear your thoughts &amp;#x200B;
Dude it's been 70 years, move on.
Am I the only one who can't even do this on paper? I suck at drawing
Glad you liked it!
If flask has been upgraded I like to test if first, then if it works I upgrade requirements.txt, not before. Or if I have legacy packages that need a specific combination on python + packages, I like to be able to build this forever on new hardware, new os etc. I do not care what versions are running, only that the app works as intended.
It’s an ongoing reality for me. I wish I can move on.
Thanks, it is hot on my backlog. Currently each column width is automatically picked by its longest value, but I I'm thinking on adding a max length (with truncated/wrap)... I'm thinking on how to let the user specify such per-column settings in a non-annoying and readable way.
Was he referring to the python approach to indentation to denote where code blocks start and stop? It tends to be something that drives people that cut their teeth on other languages a bit crazy! Or people will point to it as something that makes the language "unusable" as if every language doesn't have their own way of doing the same thing.
#UPSIDE DOWN (I love it though)
My guess what is meant: if you write a block of code to be iterated over in a for-loop statement, or conditionally execute within an if-elif-else statement, that block of code must be indented relative the other blocks by four column steps. There are common style conventions that put additional constraints on where to add whitespace, but these are conventions, and all languages have them. (Some C programmers have their [wars over the curly brackets](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/6gk0wf/there_are_two_kind_of_people_on_this_world/)... newline before or after the bracket?) If you write very nested code, with many levels of indentation, the code does become hard to read, and one may be tempted to add some comments to clarify which level a particular block is at. One might counter that with that if this is the case, you are writing bad code and should break things up into separate functions, use recursion, use list comprehensions etc. In short, this is minutia on which to have animated coffee break conversations about because hey what else is there to talk about, but it's *not* a reason to select one language over another.
I was curious about this and the practice is explicitly endorsed for lists and tuples in [Fluent Python: Clear, Concise and Effective Programming](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491946008/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1). There are sections of the chapter on lists that use the += operator using NumPy examples specifically. 
That's great to hear. Ive played around quite a bit today with pydantic (inspired by https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) and integrated that with ariadne and it worked really well. Hopefully we can pull together lots of different pieces for great GraphQl integrations in Python: orm, types, validation, schema generation and async servers. Feels like we aren't far away.
Are you learning by yourself? Or through school/college etc.
I have just graduated high school, I will be attending college next year, to hopefully go into something related to law, or tech I have been trying to learn by myself, but it has been hard. 
Appreciated, think this answers what I was looking at. This doesn't deter me from Python as I'm no power user just handy to understand. Thanks!
&gt; "A couple of months" A good analog for learning programming, is hitting your head against a wall over and over again for years. Until one day you start to understand why you're getting headaches. Give it time, embrace that you don't know anything, don't just dip your feet into something you don't understand, jump all the way in! Try stuff, Break stuff, Read stuff, most importantly... write code. just keep on keepin' on, you will get there. If you have 10 years of experience, or 10 days. You WILL feel like you don't know anything, programming is a continous learning process. Enjoy the journey
Have you tried online courses at places like Codecademy?
Build a project or two. Something simple like a game using curses/sdl/pygame to start. Do some coding problems: project euler and sphere online judge are some examples.
This is what makes me turn to something like PySimpleGUI instead of Tkinter... 30 days to make a music player... PySimpleGUI has a tutorial that uses near 30 commands.
Hmm why not look for a course related to CS or software engineering?
Thanks for this, but even after like a couple months I feel like I haven’t really even learned the basics the only thing that has really stuck into my head is print(“Hello World”) and I feel like it’s only that because everytime I try to learn every tutorial starts with that. I just want to find something that challenges me and I can keep plugging away, but in order to do that I have to find some place that teaches good. 
Yes I tried their 4 1/2 hour YouTube video a couple weeks ago, but I still don’t understand a lot of it. I have notes I kept and everything through PyCharm
That's completely natural though. A programming language is just that - a language. You have to learn all the words and punctuation and how to string sentences together, and that doesn't all happen at once. Of course you're going to forget a word occasionally, but you can always find it again. And then you know that that word is important enough to not want to forget. And by the way, that never goes away. I like to think of myself as a fairly experienced programmer, and I'm constantly having to look up how to do super simple stuff or look something up because I forgot a keyword. But that's what documentation is there for. Not as a crutch, but as an invaluable resource to supplement your own knowledge. So keep learning, and keep forgetting, and keep relearning. You'll find that the more you do, the more you'll remember in the future. Eventually you'll write a whole function or class or whatever and think to yourself "I had to look up how to do all of this before, and this time I didn't", and there's no more rewarding feeling than that. 
I would love to do that, but I would have no idea on where to even start..
Learning a language for the sake of knowing a language can be difficult. Everyone learns differently. My advice to you is to do two things: 1) Make projects for yourself. If the guide that you use to study python has you make a bit of sample code, make some similar code for yourself. Small programs - don't bite off more than you can chew. If the guide shows you how to put a button on a screen, then after that make a xylophone of buttons in a row that beeps different notes. You might retain more by making your own variations on what you learn. 2) Take notes. Long ago in high school, the most important thing I learned is... how to learn. I learned what note-taking works for me. I learned when I might need to reread something to retain it better. I learned what environment is conducive to learning. Some people learn better with videos. Some with tutoring. &amp;#x200B;
Thank you for this, may I ask where you have learned? I have paid for udemy courses but I feel like they weren’t really all that much help. Should I just keep re watching them, and retaking all the courses until it’s stuck in my head, or is that not a good strategy?
No? Why would I have debug=1 hardcoded like that?
How so? It's no different than running a "live server" locally to make sure everything works then deploying to the real one. 
Normally i don't recommend Youtube for learning, however watching the basic, and then watching them again, and again. Is really good. But it is also super important to dedicate some time for pondering. If you approach learning programming, as you would high school math or chemistry. It is just going to fly out of your brain again. Ponder about what you can do with what you just saw in the video, think about how the applications you use could be made. Iteratively make stuff! calculators are a good beginner project for this exact reason, they're easy to expand. Keep learning, watch the same basics tutorial 10 times, what all of the tutorials 5 times more (hyperbole). Its all about persistence. Use and ponder, don't study or cram. Approach it from a place of genuine curiosity. btw, i didn't feel like i knew the basics before i had been doing it for years. It is a very plateau and growth-spurt based learning curve from my experience. 
Thank you for the reply, my problem is that I am a hands on learner, and I really don’t know anyone that could help me with Python, online, and have it seem like an actual hands on experience. I always take notes, and I am in a good environment to learn it’s just so difficult for me for some reason that I can’t seem to figure out. 
Thank you, I will keep plugging away at the basics and hopefully it will eventually stick into my head. I appreciate the long informative response. 
My first introduction to Python was through Code Academy (don't do this, there are much better places these days). But I didn't really feel like I was learning anything until I started doing my own projects. It's one thing to write functions because a Python tutorial tells you to, it's a whole different thing to write a function because you think it's the best way to solve a problem. So try and find little little projects to do, even if you don't think you're quite skilled enough to tackle them. I've always found that having my own personal context for courses to be really valuable. Like, lets say I have it in my head that I want to make a simple game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Rock Paper Scissors. While I'm doing a course, I can take what they're teaching and think "Ok, I could use this for this part of my project, and that for this other part..." I feel like it helps the material stick better than just trying to learn something with no context. And when you go back to your project and get stuck, you can go back to the course and use it as a reference for what you're trying to do. As for other learning resources, the /r/learnpython sidebar is a great place to start.
Thanks!!
Okay thank you, I will try and complete some simple tasks that I may be able to tackle, and I will go take a look at that subreddit as well, appreciate your responses. Have a great day.

nothing more than python and the included sqlite3 library. The tables are quite simple, so no need to get complex. Below is the full description. Two tables, bound by one key.

It would be awsome if you could analyse the image and convert it into a text file or even Latex file. Would that be really hard? 
Hello — ADHD here. The short answer is pick the simplest case project first to solidify your skills, then pick the one you're most interested in.
You need to figure out your learning method and passion. At first I think it is best to just learn Python because you are bored ( I personally rathered sources like sololearn at the start, and later wiki pages and then videos but you could be different) And just do whatever you want to, learn variables or just learn to make a list, and eventually do what you want as you go. &amp;#x200B; Stressing yourself over becoming "good" with python is stupid, I always feel stupid because I am not doing advanced stuff in python, but what you need to think, it "print("helloworld")" is actually pretty cool.
My hot tip: pick the smallest project first. Finishing projects is really useful and helps you gain cognitive skills that help with choice paralysis. If you don't know which will end up to be the smallest in scope, you can always make a `random.choice`. ;)
What method did you use for painting this object?
I need a simple project to program to learn with, does anyone have any ideas? 
I recently started getting in to pyautogui and am working through the basic examples. Pretty exciting. It can be used to solve what seemed like intractable problems. 
The key to prioritising for me is to get stuff out of my head and onto paper/screen. I've found using a prioritisation matrix helpful for this. [https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2017/07/enter-matrix-lean-prioritisation/](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2017/07/enter-matrix-lean-prioritisation/) (Skip down to the section titled "**Two by Two, Step by Step"**.) As the article suggests, I draw a vertical “Value” axis and a horizontal “Effort” axis on a sheet of paper. Then I plot every idea in my head onto the page. The act of getting everything into one place somehow makes it clear what to work on. Usually—but not always—it's something from the low effort, high value quadrant. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;

Imagine a scenario where you need a script or lib for some development process, which then gets inadvertently deployed to prod (because you copy everything), and then it’s found vulnerable. Or a file with some secrets or comments left around for convenience, which again is left in prod, potentially to be read by an attacker. With a reproducible-but-separate build, that script or file would not have been there, since its installation process would have never made it to the prod build. Some tools try to avoid this scenario by specifying somewhere that “this is just for dev”, like npm does. However, it’s often an optional step that can be skipped, a parameter forgotten, and lo. With a separate build script, the developer is forced to make an explicit and conscious decision - which is always better, imho, from a security perspective.
Can anybody suggest me something as a medium difficulty big project? I keep looking around for programming ideas/lists but all of them are aimed to beginners and I don't have much creativity...
as someone who is a beginner and has been learning python for only about a month, i recommend learning the basic concepts first, for example if/elif/else statements, for loops, while loops, how variables work, etc. A youtuber I recommend to learn the basics is CS Dojo (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxX9wt5FWQUAAz4UrysqK9A) who has a fantastic series teaching python for absolute beginners. After learning the basics, dont be nervous to jump into making a simple project. After I learned the basics, I went straight into making a discord bot, and I have learned so much working on it. If you run into an error or you cant figure out how to do something, google is your friend! No programmer is perfect, its ok to google something or ask questions on sites like Stack Overflow or this subreddit. ( shitty self promotion: my discord bot is called Role Saver bot, https://discordbotlist.com/bots/526485456980934677 ) 
Agreed, I don't see the point of it either.
When your code has a lot of start up time, you can debug or explore way faster. Pandas has a great integration, which makes notebooks + pandas a great tool for data exploration. It is great for tutorials, you see code and results next to each other, and on github you can view them nicely. In one comment you said you prefer notebooks because of the code completion, but vscode has code completion and can run notebooks, so there is at least one solution. You are not supposed to have a notebook with &gt;1000 lines of code though.
if you do have a simple idea for a project but don't know where to start, write down in pseudo code, which is basically writing fake code in a way that makes sense to you. that makes the how the project could be written. think about what data you need to get, what you need to store, what you need to change, etc. for example, lets say i wanted to make a simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, or divide two numbers that you input through the console. This is how my thought process would go: First, ask for the first number and store it in a variable Then, ask for a second number and store it in a variable Now ask for the operation (+, -, *, /) and store that in a variable if the operation == "+", then add the 2 numbers, if operation == "-", etc i don't feel like typing more but i feel i have said enough for my point to get across. Just jump into a project that you have an idea for, figure out the basic things you need for that project, and go from there. I find personally that learning on your own by trial and error is the best way to learn. 
Basically I want to us a service from one site (creating an diferent interface between), allowing the reCaptcha to be shown on this new interface, but sending the answer to the origin.
How about this? List 10 projects here on Reddit. Have people vote which one you should do. Then do that one, and no others. Put your project here for people to see as you do it, or after. &amp;#x200B; That removes your burden of selecting a project and forces accountability. Benefit: You have one project done. If during that project you think to yourself "why didn't I do this other project" or " I feel bad, I should be working on X" then examine the reasons why and use that as criteria for selection of projects. Rinse, lather, repeat. 
Sure I sent you a message. Let me know what you think. 
Good job, I wish I was half as smart as you
You would have to modify the 4-Point transform script (mapper.py) that finds the end points before applying perspective transform and also the loop that finds square contours to whatever the shape of paper that you would be using. Rest of the parts would be the same. 
Probably something like: import rocky import pypainter def main(): pp = pypainter.LogoPainter() pp.on(rocky.SmallStone()) if __name__ == "__main__" main()
Use `_` for parts you don't care about.
I'm actually learning Python right now but started learned PowerShell first. I have tried to learn Python a few times before I got into PowerShell and ran into, what sounds like, a similar problem. I had no idea what to do with it so I had a lot of trouble putting the basics together. I couldn't see the context around the basics. I needed something real, to see real results on something for me to really get it. I got a job in IT and had to use PowerShell a ton. But, it gave me real life scenarios to understand how the if statements and loops and all that were used for it to finally click. Learning Python is definitely a lot easier now at least in concept but I know myself that if I don't have some real results in mind, I won't follow through with the learning. So, I'm going to write a game for fun but also learn to automate stuff with Python along with PowerShell. I can suggest a couple of books. 1: Learn to code with Python by Rob mills. Has some really good structure to it for learning. 2: Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes. I suggest holding off on this one until you finish the first book but its has more intricate parts of Python along with the basics and uses prac app as a teacher. To follow that up, I like learning from reading physical books. I have a really hard time focusing on videos or even ebooks for some reason. If you don't learn well from books there are other ways. And if possible, find someone to do it with. That may be tough to find someone who wants to learn it and stick with it but it helps to learn with, bounce ideas and questions off of, and get excited about what you are learning with. &amp;#x200B; I hope it helps and good luck to you!
oh wow I didn't know that. I thought that was just a stylistic thing. Thanks for the tip!
Cool, but not related to python, and therefore not applicable to this sub. Also, at least *pretend* like you're trying to start a discussion. This isn't a notice board.
I appreciate the kind words, but know that what you see as "smart" is merely just a lot of time and energy spent on learning. Anything is possible with a bit of hard work 😄
optionally *, if py3
That's not possible and is very dangerous from a security stand point even if it was
You never actually use piece_start_x, so it is correct. Use an underscore for variables you won't use. More like "Python first world problems: I don't know enough about python yet to make jokes about pylint"
No, I think you misunderstand, the "problem" was that I needed the variable in order to unpack the tuple, but never needed to use it later on. Even I'm not stupid enough to understand that much. &amp;#x200B; Of course I could have just assigned them manually (piece\_start\_y = board.history\[0\], piece\_move\_y = board.history\[2\], and so on), but I wanted to do it in less lines of code. Hence the "first world problem"
Serious? 
Hella late to this but I just used my github link 
No, you didn't need that variable. That's the point I was making and explaining. Put an underscore in place of it to ignore it. See this stack overflow post for reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3802410/is-it-possible-to-unpack-a-tuple-in-python-without-creating-unwanted-variables This is typically done to prevent an IDE or pylint from complaining about an unused variable.
If you’re not writing programs you’re not going to learn anything. You do know where to start: you can start with hello world. Expand that. Get the user’s name and greet them by name. Get them to input their friends and store a contact list. Allow them to search that contact list. Etc. Start with what you know and expand a little bit into something you don’t. If you keep doing that you’ll keep growing you knowledge.
There’s something different about the last 3 lines compared to the first two.... it’s pretty obvious that you didn’t put much effort trying to figure this out on your own...
Ok, I know, my bad. Other people already pointed it out. TIL. Thanks mate.
Lol u cock, but I agree with you
This. pyglet is using GL primitives to draw things. The basic docs to the high level interface to this is found here: [https://pyglet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/programming\_guide/graphics.html](https://pyglet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/programming_guide/graphics.html) &amp;#x200B; If you are actually looking for the code that goes into how the data becomes pixels on the screen, you might want to search youtube for videos on making a Software 3D renderer. Is that what you mean, u/rishirk?
Are you serious?
This has to be a troll lol. Even someone that's never written a line of code can recognize patterns and could determine this issue. 
It is just a stylistic thing, but its such a common one that linters care about it. It falls into the same bucket as things like naming functions `like_this` and classes `LikeThis` - the language explicitly doesn't care, but the linter does because its *good style*. And that turns out to be a fairly big bucket.
Sure, it's here [https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/blob/master/PySimpleGUI.py](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/blob/master/PySimpleGUI.py) Currently on Line 5613 &amp;#x200B;
PIL is a great library for this 
Hey, my python knowledge was close to zero however I had some experience in the web development languages. So I was a little bit of a beginner but the logic and process how each code should work was similar to Java. The only thing was the syntax, and getting used to not using variable declarations like “String var” or using “{}, ;” I first picked up the crash course then moved into “Automate the Boring stuff” after I ran through the book 2 and a half times, I dived into “Fluent”
They can actually talk. Look up pandas.read\_excel, or even better, save excel sheets as csv. This way you can process excel files without ever opening M$ Excel.
Pandas + Seaborn is my go to. I love Seaborn because of all the easy one liners you can use to make visuals that get the point across. 
Thanks. Do you stick with Seaborn for presenting final results and/or dashboards?
Hmmm haven't had to. But you can definitely make athletically pleasing visuals with it. I don't think it's really meant for Dashboards though. Another library that may be worth looking into is Bokeh. Interactive visuals that you can send to anyone. I think you can do dashboards with that

Nice man! Everyone has gotta start somewhere!

This week I am working on a chat program. I did originally want to let users make their own private chat rooms where everyone can talk simultaneously but that requires the select module. I haven't learnt the select module so I am doing something a bit different. Where you can just direct message other users that have an account on the server.
LoL!!
Great work as always, Gabe! 
Building a json string like {"input_value": input()}, dumping them with the json package can do the trick. The json package can be useful for data/object to string conversion.

I am currently working on a tough one, a friend wanted me to make him a script that logs into a website to get data, so I have been trying to make that for a hour or two now, I am having a blast, but also struggling, hopefully I can overcome and accomplish this. 
I agree! Yours actually made me start an out loud laugh that I had to catch else I'd have a bunch of Co workers staring at me like there's something wind with me lol.
Those kind of projects are always fun! Remember to take a break when things start to get too frustrating. You’ll get the most epiphanies when your mind is left to wander. Oh and if you haven’t already, dig into the network requests the website sends in your browsers dev tools. You might find a hidden API to scrape data from. Keep pushing 😁
+1 for tqdm. We use it at work for keeping progress stats and timing, even when not showing the actual bar itself. 
I never liked Python for exactly that reason. Dynamically typed, no compiling or type checking, having to indent every block or loop four spaces, etc. JavaScript is similar, although it does use standard curly braces for blocks and is whitespace insensitive, and you can run it server-side with Node. My problem with the whitespace sensitivity is how it removes freedom of formatting to write elegant code. In Java, or C++, or C#, I can, for example, put a line of code on the same line as the conditional of the if statement if I want to, saving lines and improving the look. You just can't do that with Python. Some people love it, but I prefer the more traditional, object-oriented, statically typed language with the exception of JavaScript. 
In the directory you were in when you created the ve, run `source my_venv_dir/bin/activate`. You should then see (my\_venv\_dir) in front of the prompt, and you can then run your python files.
Yeah I just had to take a break think I was making a mistake, so I deleted the script, and I’ll have to restart soon.. I wish there was some sort of video I could like follow along but implement my own data.. I am very new to all of this, so it is hard on me. 
Sorry, got a little impatient. You have throw it all in a list to have it work in Python3: evensSteven=list(filter(lambda x: x%2==0, PhillisList))
Does it handle recursive dependencies?
Check out csdojo on YouTube 
Hey that's not bad, especially if it works the way you want. However there are many things in there that you want to avoid. First of all, you are using the a1/a2/etc lists as single value containers. If you want to do that, you have to use the `global` keyword, not hack it with a list. Also, you probably want to have a list of list to represent your board, and not 9 lists/variables. For example, `board = [["O", " ", " "], [" ", "X", " "], [" ", "O", " "]]`. You can then access (and change) the contents of board using `board[row][column]`. If you do that, you will still be able to access and mutate the board from all of your functions (without having to add `global`), but they will be much cleaner. Everything that is defined as repeated code currently, you will be able to define using Python loops operating on your board "list of list". For example, to check for lines, you could use : # Find horizontal lines for row in range(3): if board[row][0] == board[row][1] == board[row][2]: print("Winner :", board[row][0]) # Find vertical lines for col in len(board[0]): if board[0][col] == board[1][col] == row[2][col] print("Winner :", board[0][col]) # Find diagonal lines if (board[0][0] == board[1][1] == board[2][2] or board[2][0] == board[1][1] == board[0][2]): print("Winner :", board[1][1]) For example, all the `o_fill_c1` functions will be rewritten as : def fill(board, row, column, player): board[row][column] = player print_map(board) That we can use as `fill(board, 1, 2, "X")` for example. Also notice that I made another change in that snippet above: I made fill take the `board` as argument, rather than supposing it is defined in the module. And I gave `board` to print_map as well. It is generally better to make your state explicit (define everything from a "main" function, then call other functions by giving them objects as arguments), so that you can see which parts of your program with each other. When things get too complex (too many state variables), it will be time to try to write classes to "group" the state into specific objects, but you can keep that for later, and just try to make your state well-defined and explicit. Hope you got what I meant, feel free to ask if not.
He was speaking of the copy paste of his own code, which can be (as he supposed well) a sign of code that's not properly written (although not always). In his case, the copy/pasting is clearly abusive, it is used in place of function arguments (example, defining o_fill() and x_fill() rather than fill(player='o'), or defining functions for each case of the board).
I just found a bunch of stuff to subscribe to ;)
`[x for x in range(1, 21) if x % 2 == 0]`
In Python 3 **range**, **map**, and **filter** are equivalent to Python 2's **xrange**, **itertools.imap**, and **itertools.ifilter**, so yeah you need to wrap them in **list** to expand them to the full result set.
Oh, I misunderstood him. I thought the discussion was about copy pasting code from other sources. Duplicated code is not good at all, and should absolutely be avoided. If the same(or very similar code) exists in more than one place, it needs to be a function.
While this comment is not directly related to issue, instead of a picture you can post a link to imgur album with needed picture. 
Parsing a JSON file takes up a _lot_ more memory than the file itself. See that bit way at the bottom where it does `data.split('\n)`? Right there if **data** is a single 2Gb string then you've doubled your RAM usage just by splitting it into lines. Now no one process can ever have exclusive access to _all_ (or even most) of your RAM, so somewhere in there the likelihood is you've got a file that's simply too big to fit into your per-process RAM limit. I don't know Dask at all, they might be handing something off to Pandas wrong, and Pandas might further be doing something wrong with JSON, but there's a decent chance your JSON file's are just too large to parse in a single go, and definitely in a tight loop with multiple threads. I'd raise an issue with the Dask project and see if you get some answers there. Otherwise consider splitting those files up.
Not sure, but I would imagine so, the algorithm is somewhat simple, but looks like it should handle that. It takes starting dependencies and evaluates them then adds computed dependencies. Then repeats the process until it gets stable.
What kinds of things are you interested in? A fun toy project I've started playing with is a sentence ordering program. I'm interested in natural language processing, and writing a program to order sentences is an interesting and ambiguous challenge. In a similar vein, there's article summarization: where you take a news article and try to create a short summary of it (usually by selecting k sentences from the article which most strongly relate to the article as a whole) But that's NLP, why do you want to program, what sorts of problems are you eager to tackle?

Build a django Webapp which is Elasticsearch backed. As a webfrontend to search files on ftp servers. Bonus: Build a ftp crawler which uses MLSD and NLST ftp commands.

This guide is misleading, and sets beginners on the way to misunderstanding how Python works. The guide says: &gt; **What are the variables in python?** Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory. That is **not** true in Python! [https://realpython.com/python-variables/](https://realpython.com/python-variables/) has a much better explanation. There's also [http://effbot.org/zone/python-objects.htm](http://effbot.org/zone/python-objects.htm) but that's not really beginner-oriented. &amp;#x200B;
Yeah, That's What I was looking for. Anyway Thanks A lot for all the help!!!
Class instances are essentially glorified tuples. The amount of memory they will take can be roughly computed by this formula: `pointer to PyTypeObject` + `pointer to PyObject` times number of instance fields. Dictionaries in order to ensure their speed properties have to meet some space requirements: 1. Typically, internally, a dictionary is either an array of linked lists, or just an array, or, sometimes a tree of some sort with leafs being lists or arrays etc. No matter the underlying structure, it needs to have at least 30% of empty memory cells, otherwise collisions become too common, and access speed decreases. 2. If your dictionaries contain very few keys, you'll be paying extra price because dictionaries will not be filled to the maximum capacity. So, halving the memory footprint doesn't seem out of ordinary, that's quite as expected.
Go away mate, this is a programming sub. 
Thank you very much for the explaination. Since its only a hobby I have no clue about RAM Usage, Assignment and all that stuff, I think I understand it now, thanks!
I was in the same boat, and started looking at different learning techniques. Spaced repetition and active recall methods really really helped me a lot. Take a watch of Ali Abdaal’s study videos, in particular https://youtu.be/Z-zNHHpXoMM. It helped me, hopefully help you as well! 
Yes.
They already aced bootstrapping: &gt; `pip install dotlock` Now I'll be waiting for `pipenv` to wrap `dotlock` with a driver they put in `vendor` or the other way around. More garbage to the god of garbage!
Y'all nerds.
Then your production isn't running on a snapshot of your development environment, but rather something similar.
There's a free book "inside the Python virtual machine" or something that I started some time ago and want to continue if I find time; iirc it was good. Also the talk "a bit about bytes - understanding Python bytecode" by one of the django devs, should be on youtube
I made my mouse bordeless for my three monitors setup with this package! Great work! Here is the gist: https://gist.github.com/albcunha/9301bcf204d3aaa5a7cf1e834d82e8c1
Thanks a lot! I'm checking it right now
Database is too slow? You sure about that?
400k entries in a database is a joke for them. Modern databases can handle millions and billions. Use sqlite, put an index on the key column and have your memory usage drop to 20mb or less.
Yes, it is. Look out on OCR technology, it's not easy to make something work reliably. You could probably use something like Tesseract pretty easily, but prepare yourself to get some meh results depending on orientation, lighting, and overall quality of the print. 
How would you go about using them? Multiinheritance for each Magic Method you implemented? I honestly never heard of them
Have you tried to write anything under your `if dice_coice == "1":`and put the right level of identation?

you are talking about accessing not updating data
yeah, sure its not that slow for that amount but still too slow for my case

Possibly no one other than me will benefit from this, but still. This tool performs hardcore reflection using regex on a .py file that has a \_main_ block. The output is a PS1 file with a function that can be used for calling the specified .py script, including the passing of parameters. I just made it because I figured it would optimize my life just a little bit, and also because I was bored. Fun fact #1: you can run this script on itself. Fun fact #2: I guess you can technically write PS code from within Python using this module, but I don't know why you would want to do that.
ahhhh, that makes a lot of sense. Thank you!
SMS or messaging client like telegram/signal/messenger? If SMS (cell phone) idk how (might be tricky) but you can probably muster up some google searches "python package for receiving SMS messages". My hunch is if you're using android and have the device rooted, you can probably install your script on your phone and access the SMS db (maybe - android works off VMs). Probably it'll have to be a python/android hybrid thing. If you're talking about a messaging client, google for api for bots. Telegram has one. You then just have to figure out how to obtain your reply messages (read api docs) and identify the sent time for each. From there just determine your specific time frame and reply with whatever you want.
Any chance you'll share the code? A 300MB tuple sounds like really bad style
This PEP is from 2002. Back then it could've been a function, but nowadays it's a _class_, so let's call a spade a spade. The reason for mentioning all of this here is to help other people _not to misunderstand_ what `enumerate` really is.
Pick the one that would be most beneficial for yourself. If you see the value in it it will help you keep pushing on and get out of the slump. Good luck!

I've never used them too much but a good 5-second sales pitch example is below this section of the documentation https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.AsyncGenerator class ListBasedSet(collections.abc.Set): ''' Alternate set implementation favoring space over speed and not requiring the set elements to be hashable. ''' def __init__(self, iterable): self.elements = lst = [] for value in iterable: if value not in lst: lst.append(value) def __iter__(self): return iter(self.elements) def __contains__(self, value): return value in self.elements def __len__(self): return len(self.elements) s1 = ListBasedSet('abcdef') s2 = ListBasedSet('defghi') overlap = s1 &amp; s2 # The __and__() method is supported automatically
Yeah i found that i should use PRAW so i'm learning about it.
The simplest thing to do is as you said to make it global, declare it `danny_old_location = None` after the import statement &amp;#x200B; Another way to do it (and helpful if you plan to have multiple clients) is to create a class that will hold all future methods you will implement and set it as `user_data` and you will receive that object as `userdata` arg in `on_message` function &amp;#x200B; class MyClass: danny_old_location = None def update_location(self, payload): # do whatever needs to be done # ... def on_message(client, userdata, msg): print(msg.topic+" "+str(msg.payload)) # Use your userdata userdata.update_location(msg.payload) #userdata object is the instance of your class # ... client = mqtt.Client() client.on_connect = on_connect client.on_message = on_message myobject = MyClass() client.user_data_set(myobject) As I said this new way to do it is more useful if you have multiple clients. Each client can be set to have a different instance of userdata (MyClass) and the correct userdata will be passed into the `userdata` argument

I just started doing it and was fairly fluent in a couple weeks. **However**. I started with a CS degree 25 years ago and have been working as a software engineer that entire time. Pretty soon you pick up languages like no big deal: "What does the call syntax look like? And the conditionals? What fundamental data structures does it use most? OK, I got it. Just give a standard library reference." You might want to take a programming course rather than trying to learn Python specifically.
Try using `subprocess.Popen` instead of `os.system` to open the application.
In this way? Subprocess.popen(Gnome-terminal).. 
Linux file systems are generally case sensitive. Try gnome-terminal instead of Gnome-terminal. 
Thank you bro..it worked

Aspie/ADHD here. Like others have suggested, pick the smallest first. But if you want to do a larger topic because you like the material better, then start "chunking" it. Break it down into smaller, more manageable subproblems and then combine results at the end. Like DP, but for your life. I mainly program in C++ and I implemented a compiler using this technique. It was always a personal goal of mine to implement such a large project on my own. Now I have a Java-like PL that I can compile to MIPS assembly. Pro-Tip: Use a planner to keep track of what you have done and what you plan to do. Don't be afraid to prioritize tasks and push other ones back. This will allow you to focus on the subproblem at hand and keep making progress towards the goal. Good luck!
Im curious how you use this. I use powershell a lot at work and have just started learning python.
 import subprocess as subProc from subprocess import STDOUT import os subProc.Popen(['open','/Applications/Terminal.app'], stdout=os.open(os.devnull, os.O_RDWR), stderr=STDOUT) 
I'm curious to know if you've ever looked at IronPython. Seems like a much cleaner way to handle this sort of thing.
A super pun!
You might want to look at setup.py entry points. The console_scripts entry point generates wrapper script, but that's built into setup tools or something. That might be good enough for you, or maybe you want a parent package that looks for a more general entry point.
ABCs provide two thing: * Clearer/cleaner protocol testing e.g. you want to see if something is a collection (an iterable with a `len()` and a `in`) you can check for `isinstance(object, collections.abc.Collection)` * Convenience for implementation via mixin methods, similar to the old `DictMixin`. For instance if you want to implement a list-like object you can extend `MutableSequence`, implement the 5 abstract (required) methods and get the rest of the list/`MutableSequence` interface for free (you may want to override others for performance reasons but you don't have to). IME it's most useful for mappings because there are 10 different methods (for an immutable mapping, more for mutable) but with ABCs you only need to implement 3 (`__getitem__`, `__iter__` and `__len__`), the rest is expressed in terms of these abstract methods.

I've unsubscribed from this spammer everywhere just to see it here again. Well, that sucks.
I've been having a ton of fun with MicroPython on the BBC micro:bit. I came from the Arduino world using their development language. With micropython I can develop my own modules, go into REPL and debug, this makes testing so much simpler. My next board will probably be the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express since it's designed for wearable. They have a reddit for their port of micropython [https://www.reddit.com/r/circuitpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/circuitpython) . There is a lot of videos on Youtube on writing effective micropython which are important to know. I don't think I would use micropython for something that is insanely timing critical. However I think that micropython is a good fit for other kinds of applications. 
I see tons of these posts every day as well. I report and downvote them. Usually when I come back later I don't see any downvoted posts so it's a way to see that the mods are addressing the reports at least. I totally agree that more advanced questions are appropriate. They usually lead to a discussion about part of the language.
Are you referring to me? Or Real Python?
but this is REALPYTHON :P
Realpython, sure. Sorry if i insulted you.
haha...I was thinking maybe OP had a ton of python scripts he wanted to use from powershell scripts and didn't want to rewrite them...maybe?
Well, that's quite nice to know!
It's probably where I'm headed in the future. But at least QT Designer can get a GUI up and running. It can always be refactored later.

If you wanted some serious iterop, you can actually use the CLR from Python - &amp;#x200B; Either download the [PowerShell 5.0 nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.PowerShell.5.ReferenceAssemblies/) and extract it for the System.Management.Automation.dll or use `[PSObject].Assembly.Location` to find the one on your system and use it as so: ```python import clr import sys sys.path.append(r"Path\to\extracted") clr.AddReference("System.Management.Automation") from System.Management.Automation import PowerShell ps = PowerShell.Create() # Create a pipeline (Bad example) ps.AddCommand("Get-Service").AddCommand("Out-String") services = ps.Invoke() for line in services: print(line) # Clear the commands ps.Commands.Clear() # Another example ps.AddCommand("Get-Process") procs = ps.Invoke() print(procs[0].BaseObject.ProcessName) ```
By your posting history, it's hard to tell the difference. In fact, I've tagged you as a realpython spambot up until now. 
No we're good. Just wanted to be clear. I'm curious why you call Real Python a spammer? In full transparency, I work for Real Python as their Community Manager. So if there are things we can do better, I'd like to know about it. Happy to take any constructive feedback, both positive and negative.

Rendering a browser on such an e-paper screen is difficult. You could run some sort of emulator with the resolution of the e-paper. Then screengrab it and export it. Convert it to B/W and then dump it into the e-paper with the Image library. Repeat every second. Another angle is looking at terminal browsers, these could be easily incorporated.
I can see that. I will admit I'm more of a lurker on Reddit as a whole than as a someone who posts often. But that's on me. Thank's for the feedback. 
nice , but if you find no "output" directory in the script path , it fails instead of asking if you want to create it. Failing to do so crash with FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'output/temp.html' Just creating the folder solves it.
&gt;why is the language being extended to force the developer to manually hint with types It isn't. It's entirely optional. As that was your only example I don't feel you put much thought into your fear. &amp;#x200B;
But you're not forced to use type hints?

As the friendly neighborhood HelperBot notes this probably isn't the best place for this question. On top of that when asking questions in any programming area do not post images of code--actual text works. On top of on top of that provide as much actual information (preferably briefly) to explain your issue. In this case actually pointing to the software you are trying to run would've been useful [Glossika-to-Anki](https://github.com/emesterhazy/glossika-to-anki) I presume. At any rate you're going to need a line like . . . 'KR': ['EN', '???', 'RR'], . . . you'd also need to add a comma after the "'ROM']" portion of the previous line. 'KR' -- that would be part of the pdf file names that specify the language. Should be something like 'glossika-enko...'. 'EN' -- I assume this is specifying that it is Korean/English cards '???' -- no idea what this would be. It is some sort of character within each flash card that specifies the start of a phrase. SEE BELOW. 'RR' -- is the romanization format for the Korean cards. This could also possibly be 'MR' or 'YALE'. I actually have no idea. For the '???' part it may be one of the two characters shown on [Page with sample korean card](https://jreidy17.wordpress.com/2014/07/18/glossika/) -- I assume one character is for South and one for North. (Again--no idea.) You may be able to get some help in r/anki or r/glossika . Your best bet to get any sort of real help may be to open an issue on the git repo and ask very nicely for assistance in getting the Korean cards to work.

For those wondering "why" --- there are some things that power shell can do that are windows specific that you largely can't get anywhere else. I did something quite similar a few months ago that this would have been really nice for that interacts with the Outlook Win32 API to help sync calendars. I could have used something perhaps mroe robust or even did it in another language like C# but powershell has a fairly simple command that allows you to loop through calendar events and output the text. So instead of learning a totally new language, I found the one liner and had Python execute it.
It can be a bit of a "can't see the forest among the trees" scenario but the unit tests can provide a lot of use case and or implementation examples https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.7.0/Lib/test/test_abc.py
Thank you for that. Not the answer I was hoping for, but sad because editing HTML for a UI is a lot more straightforward (for me anyway) I certainly know that its at least theoretically possible because the Kindle supports rendering webpages (apples and oranges obviously but it is technically epaper) this makes me curious how they accomplish it. Maybe the framebuffer would be the way since the Raspberry Pi is relatively powerful for this purpose and doesn't do anything else besides this single task.
Imo type hints are wrong, too (write them into the docstring - Google style); but since they're optional and don't actually do anything, let them have it
Thank you. I haven't done much error catching 
&gt; But you're not forced to use type hints? yes, but if you want the speed advantages of typing you must use them as opposed to the compiler itself becoming more powerful (as is the case with F#). 
File doesn't conform to the docstring PEP and there are missing PEP8 newlines, supeeeeertriggered! Ok no jk; thanks ;)
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=javascript+to+python+converter+online
Theoretically it's optional, but not everyone is a solo developer or a tech lead who can choose architecture. People start using it, and then you have because your project or your org does. Think of it like PEP 8, and 4 spaces. It's all optional, but is it really for most developers?
&gt; Although a bit narrow sometimes I surfed about looking for their ORM support. I found [a talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq5_ml0Tp8A) where the guy talked but showed no code for an ORM that cant be used apart from the web framework. And an [interface to SQLAlchemy](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/sqlalchemy-jl-resurrected/6206) that works on the expression layer but no the oRM layer.
In theory, Python has no speed advantage from type hinting. It's purpose is to pick up coding errors, and there's nothing in the interpreter at run time to accelerate code paths due to knowing the type. Maybe they've changed it since I last checked so I could be out of date.
&gt; Python &gt; is &gt; strongly typed what would be an example of a language that is not strongly typed?
I have to say, as an admin, you are on point. This leads to the kind of nightmares that lead us to drinking.
As a sysadmin, I've seen so many batch scripts chained together to initialize global variables that OP's solution sounds like nails on chalkboard
What if the final output is .doc and can be copy pasted?
This is a great project, allowing you to add a simple GUI with only a few lines of code. Another project I've seen &amp; used is Gooey, which provides a decorator that converts argparse command line arg inputs to a simple menu.
The second link looks like exactly what you are looking for: X virtual framebuffer and CutyCapt
&gt; Could someone explain me this sorcery? Not from the vague details you give. We would have to guess what you actually did, and the version of Python you are running. But in general, changing your data structures could easily half, or double, the memory used. Precisely why is impossible to say without knowing what your data structures were before, and what they are after. 700MB seems ridiculously high for a mere 400,000 items. If I create a dict with 400,000 items, it uses about 12MB: py&gt; d = dict.fromkeys(range(400000)) py&gt; sys.getsizeof(d) 12582960 plus the sizes of the keys and values of course. If each key and value is a 10 character Unicode string, that adds another 46 MB: py&gt; s = "abcπД"*2 py&gt; 400000*2*sys.getsizeof(s) 46400000 So for a dict with 400,000 entries, consisting of 400,000 10-character strings as keys, and another 400,000 10-character strings as values, that comes to about 58 MB. Let's triple it: 180 MB. What was the other 500MB? How did you measure the size of the dict? 
Not really, but in general it's not too hard, provided that the script is not for the web. javascript is just a language, but the platform it runs on can be anything. The most popular, but not the only one, is the browser, which has its own API. JavaScript (actually ECMAScript) is the only language supported by the browser, so you can't convert it in python unless you basically have a (javascript) library that runs in the browser and does it for you. If it's running in node, then just rewrite it in python if it's short. 
As a counter opinion...I've been in the Python community for 2.5 decades. I value Real Python. Loved the dataclasses deep dive and I have made lunch plans to read this type hinting deep dive. Glad you're doing what you do.
You seem to be making vague claims about what dictionaries could hypothetically be, rather than explaining what they actually are in Python. Is there any actually existing implementation of Python where dicts are "sometimes" a tree "of some sort"? In what way are instances "essentially glorified tuples"? If nothing else, class instances include a `__dict__`. or `__slots__`, or both, to map names (keys) to attributes (values). Instances are more like dicts, and typically use a dict as part of their implementation. Finally, you say "If your dictionaries contain very few keys, you'll be paying extra price because dictionaries will not be filled to the maximum capacity" -- while that's true, even if your dict contains lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of keys, they won't be filled to the maximum capacity. And precisely the same thing applies to the class instance `__dict__` so it isn't really relevant unless the class is designed to use `__slots__`. 
Bindings for Python are currently being implemented. Also the original prototype of the software was written in Python. 
PHP and Javascript are both weakly typed to some extent. In the latter you can e.g. add integers and strings and the integer will be automatically coerced to a string. 
Thanks! Greatly appreciate the help!
People who complain about these features don't really appreciate how hard is to work in large project with many teams. These features are there because if you don't have these kind of things the IDE cannot help you or linters can't spot obvious mistakes, which then bite you when the code is deployed on the customers' machines. Docstrings seem the solution, but is it? docstrings have no machine-readable structure, and there's nothing that enforces, company wide, a strict policy. Plus, humans make typos and mistakes all the time. PyCharm tries to parse docstrings to infer types on occasions, but it's unreliable and requires discipline. Type hints are interpreter-enforced machine-readable docstrings. It's a good thing. A well developed package will provide an added bonus if they are type hinted, and your linters will report weird stuff as early as possible. duck typing is a good idea, but like everything else, if you don't know when to use it, the code will become a mess. Programming is mostly about common conventions and partial restrictions. Anything that helps you, your team, and other teams to keep on track is welcome. 
Hi Do you mean to ask if you could create a .doc and has actual text in it so that it can be copy pasted? If yes,then you would have to perform OCR using pytesseract but to get proper results highly depends on the image. 
I use JS and Python, send me a link and if it's small enough I'll help you translate it?
&gt; Type hints are interpreter-enforced machine-readable docstrings. It's a good thing. Well, again, F# has managed to infer types and do quite robust type checks while you are editing your code... with no need to manually specify types. 
Guys, VSCode and Vim are not IDEs, they are fucking text editors, get that right. 
You can insert/update thousands of records per second with a database. 
I don't know anything about F# so I can't comment, but every language has constraints. Remember that python development honors a few directives that are paramount. Loosely speaking: - things must be implementable in CPython. - things implemented cannot make single threaded code slower (that's why the GIL is there and was not removed: locking at a finer level would make single threaded code slower) - things cannot make the CPython code excessively complicated so that new changes become impossible to add. So it might well be that the feature you say would disrupt CPython so much that type hints is the good enough solution that doesn't require a massive rewriting and redesign of CPython.
That is how we learn ;) Also made another modification, because i have my youtube in spanish , so your function fails to detect the no-link of the youtube list... just add from itertools add islice and then your function get_subs_from_xml gets like this only_outline_tags = SoupStrainer('outline') subscriptions = [] with codecs.open(filename, 'r', 'utf-8') as f: soup=BeautifulSoup(f, 'xml', parse_only=only_outline_tags) for outline_tag in islice(soup.find_all('outline'),1,None): link = outline_tag.get('xmlUrl') name = outline_tag.get('text') subscriptions.append({'name':name, 'link':link}) return subscriptions That should just work fine in any language.
So much anger! I think I like you :) Well, class instances are like tuples in the sense of how they are implemented in C. The idea is that they pre-allocate the necessary amount of memory for the slots they know exist. This is what tuples do. The difference is that class instances have mechanics for adding more fields, which would have to be allocated retroactively. &gt; Is there any actually existing implementation of Python where dicts are "sometimes" a tree "of some sort"? I don't know and don't care. Why should you? Are you making an atlas of how dictionaries are implemented in Python? If so, what makes you think it's of any but historical interest? The knowledge about how dictionaries can be implemented in principle is something you learn in your first year of CS college, and it generalizes very well to every programming language you see afterwards. Python is just a drop in a bucket of those languages. &gt; if your dict contains lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of keys Poor reading comprehension skill detected. Maximum capacity, as indicated in my post, for dynamically populated dictionaries is typically about 70%. For statically allocated dictionaries you may aim for 100%, but Python is light years away from doing things like that.
OS X ships with BASH and pretty much supports all the same shells as Linux
'_' is a conventional "dummy var" for these operations. It also contains the last result you get from an evaluation at the interactive prompt.
its because its more powerful
I don't remember which version I installed, but I guess yes. How can I check that? 
As soon as someone decides to make a mess of indentation so that it becomes deceiving you will appreciate that. By enforcing formatting, all python code kind of looks the same, removing one additional level of complexity in understanding someone else's code. Why overburden your already burdened mind with the whims of a prick who decided that his artistic skills deserve an IOCCC prize?
Thanks, I guess I did not clarify well. Each individual json file can be successfully processed given my ram (in fact two of them will fit). An I'm not keeping anything in memory, every thing is in the local scope, nothing return outside the function, yet, there are some stuff that do stay in memory and as a result I can't call the function more than 2 times.
Only downside of using IronPython is that it's still at 2.7. If you're using Python 3 it won't work. 
That's like saying that others should be gay because you don't like butt fucking. Your other argument is that if you work at a gay bar, you would be forced to butt fuck because others are doing the same. - type hinting is optional - it doesn't give you a speed boost in CPython - it does help your IDE generate better competitions, and adds to self-documentation and clarity. - it doesn't effect Python's dynamicity at all. &gt; Theoretically it's optional, but not everyone is a solo developer or a tech lead who can ~~choose architecture~~ set standards. if your company choses to enforce them, that's your company's doing, not Python's. If you're not comfortable with your company's tech stack, either help improve it, or change your company. &gt; instead of improving the compiler so that it inferences types - Type inferencing has its limits. Even Haskell has problems with it. For sufficiently complex type systems, type inferencing is undecidable. - Creating a powerful type inferencer takes much more time and effort that doing it in an assistive manner - by letting the programmer help out.
Why does this get posted every other week? 
I don't know, and as I said in the past, it's a good desire, but their MVC is all over the place. 
This guide is so definitive that is missing any mention of descriptor-based checks such as those implemented in django models, traits and traitlets, or pycontracts. 
That's very true, but they are working on it! https://github.com/IronLanguages/ironpython3
When you upgrade to a newer version of python or packages, there is always something that doesn’t work. An update within a month is fast. 6 months is more typical. Just don’t be on the newest version if you’re worried or just test it.
&gt; if you want the speed advantages of typing you must use them There are no speed advantages. The annotations aren't even interpreted at runtime. They're just there for static analysers. Python is typed.
Yes? what about it?
If only there was some sort of list of resources on the right side of the page ----&gt;
Yes it is. Well that was a good talk. 
Well, they offer good interactive tutorials on their website. Also check out "the coding train" youtube channel.
It's not at all the same. Not even close. Variables don't actually have types in python unlike f#
I didn't post it... it's not coming from the PySimpleGUI project in this case.
Type inferencing does not really address the problem that type hinting solves. The problem is intent. Having worked at a company that depends on python for very large systems that pass through the hands of dozens of engineers, python can become hopelessly abstract. When the code is written with a particular type in mind, there is often no practical way to make guarantees that reflect that. The reality is that not everyone is great at writing idiomatic code. Large systems can take on a collective ‘code smell’. You may not like that the language is supporting ‘unpythonic’ use cases, but the reality is that the development life-cycle matters.

Relevant PR : https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/10596 . It's blocked by next release of pip which fixes this. Major projects fixed include Flask, requests, pip, html5lib, sphinx etc. 
Im gonna guess that they havr to make this for their homework. 
Anyone got something that does the reverse? Wrap PowerShell scripts in Python? 
Why do you think so?
😅😅😅
Seems like I only get 'AttributeError: module 'PySimpleGUI' has no attribute 'Text'. 
 with open('foo.py') as f: x = f.read().replace(' ', '\t') with open('foo.py', 'w') as f: f.write(x)

Possibilities!
I've worked with Toga myself and it's not quite there yet. Fine for OSX and maybe even Linux, but the Windows support is lacking. However, if you use Windows and like the goal of Toga, they are super supportive of new contributors and love all the help they can get. Really solid maintainers over there. They also have plans of providing Win32 and Winforms backends. If you're familiar with those, your contributions will be more than welcome.

 An important goal of Python's developers is keeping it fun to use. This is reflected in the language's name—a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python[52]—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that refer to spam and eggs (from a famous Monty Python sketch) instead of the standard foo and bar.[53][54] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))
