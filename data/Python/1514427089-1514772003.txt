I'm porting someone else's project (which was very well written in python 2) to python 3.5. It's a very low level project that does lots of ords() and ascii-arithmetic. Tighest, cleanest python code I've ever seen. Trying to port it to python3 is one of the lamest projects I've ever worked on. Hundreds of breaks, forcing me to put 'b' in front of hundreds of strings to functions that used to work just fine but now require me to explicitly change the type without actually changing the value. So you can say I'm wrong (or even universally wrong), but this experience with python 3 leaves a bad taste in my mouth, and colors my opinion about it, and whether I'd recommend anyone port to it. 
I have a basic excel sheet with a bunch of stock related values. It’s easier for me to read than searching through Morningstar. But it’s still hell to initially paste all the values. I’m working on a python program to do it automatically using some stock APIs to pull the value from and pandas to write to the excel. I also just read about Microsoft considering adding Python to Excel which would be awesome
Of course! Thanks for the advice! I plan in converting this into a .exe file with PyInstaller (just like /u/itsmoppy suggested down below) so that users won't need to install Python modules or even Python itself, as it'd defeat the program's purpose of being easy to use. 
Seems like it was an unofficial matchmaking system for quake. I mean, making an unofficial matchmaking system for Dota is way beyond my pay grade, but I could take inspiration from this regardless of that. Thank you!
It's not a browser game.
"Coupling" is a measure of how the parts of your program are intertwined. It's generally bad to have tight coupling. If someone says "change the GUI from this library to that library" and you can just swap out a file and change a couple of lines in main, that's a good design.
You could maybe have a look at Thonny: http://thonny.org/
If you've setup a default python environment. You can just use run current file. Still one step at the beginning but it's not something that absolutely needs to bet set everytime you create a new project.
It's a trap! The legends of old say that whoever slays the **vb**e**a**st must surely be fated to take its place.
Modularity was one of my goals here as well. I'm afraid I crashed and burned there. Would it be advisable for there to be a "middleman" or some sort of "controller" in between the front-end (UI) and the back-end logic for the program to be coupled less tightly? I'm not entirely sure how to do this yet.
You should look to IPython for a more interactive, exploratory interface that lends itself to learning math. https://matplotlib.org/gallery.html The turtle is a fun way to do simple graphics. https://michael0x2a.com/blog/turtle-examples
Might have to look at something like d3.js if you want it to be interactive.

&gt; Right off the bat for me I see: why is OP not just making bank right now on their own? Why are they trying to get competitors.who are paying a one time fee? So my guess is that he is volume limited and think other people won't trust him with their money, so the reasoning is that you get other people to trade themselves in exchange for giving him a share - and you implement this as some sort of "trusted code". I agree with you that this probably isn't a good idea - just that the motivations behind it aren't intrinsically bad: have a trading strategy where people can trust you less with their money. There is also an incentive to make as much money as possible from a trading strategy before someone else gets there - this is an argument for getting external investors, it kind of depends on your model of how trading strategies leak. I imagine they view their competitors as only able to trade in exchange for giving them a share of the money: the code would act as a trusted black box. I am not sure how achievable this is. I agree that he probably won't get investors this way, and I wouldn't "invest" in this manner. Nevertheless... people are willing to do things that I would class as a terrible idea! In general, I think the world might be better if the trust barrier required for trading strategies was lowered (i.e. you were able to use someone else's trading strategies without having to know so much about your counterparty). Etherium offers one ways of achieving this (I think - I'm not to sure about the exact details of how this works) one can hard code contracts into the external word and have them automatically be enforced without relying on reputation, contracts and the legal system. In practice the way that this trust problem is solved in other areas is that people work for hedge funds where they develop strategies: the hedge fund provides the trust you provide the knowledge. 
I don't believe the program in its current state is complex enough to need a controller. I would define an API for the ping controller. That is you say it can have a list of servers passed in, it can be started, it can be stopped, it can have its sleep rate set, it will return to you a list/dict of servers and pings. That's likely a class with 5 public functions. Put that in a file, call it done. Now you can change anything you want in the pinger, and even add new features, but as long as those public functions don't change how they're called, the GUI won't notice and nothing will break. Put a GUI in another file. All it needs to do create its window, import the 5 functions from the pinger, then it can also whatever it the hell it wants.
Fair point. I am all for reposts after some time. And I agree that this is exciting. It’s just that this was posted a few times in the last week or so. 
I don't think matplotlib will do that out of the box; matplotlib is aimed at producing static images like png or jpgs, which obviously aren't interactive. The simplest way to get an interactive plot is to make use of web interactivity, such as a D3 app, and probably the easiest ways to get there via Python is to interface with either [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) or [Plotly](https://plot.ly). 
As an aside I'm not sure this is actually *impossible* to do. There are solutions where you have a third party run and confirm they are running known good code for doing the trading and then have one party provide it with money and the other party provide it with trading instructions. I'm not sure if you can show horn this into ec2... I mean you can have public images and ec2 can be guaranteed to not be lying about the images I'm just unclear as there is an easy way to share this. That you *can* construct such a solution does not mean that other people will trust you.
That's actually a hell of a lot more simpler than what I was doing. Looking at it now, it's as if I was trying my best to stick the two together, when I could have just done that and be done with it. Thank you very much! I'll do that and see what happens. :D 
If you aren't using a notebook then depending on the backend you have selected for matplotlib (qt and gtk should work for example) then it should "just work" out of the box. On the other hand the notebook interface with "%matplotlib inline" is just plotting static images, so there is no interactivity there. I'm not sure if "%matplotlib notebook" provides the functionality out of the box, but you can probably enable it.
Likely a `POST` with headers and cookies, url, and arguments in the body. Without knowing anything about the web service you are connecting to I can't be more specific.
&gt;It's a very low level project that does lots of ords() and ascii-arithmetic. So now you don't need to `ord` in order to convert a byte into a byte, because it's already a byte. Or maybe the problem is that you're trying to do "arithmetic" with characters, which are not numbers. Presumably the ultimate goal is to map from one character to another. Are you familiar with `str.translate` and `str.maketrans`? &gt; but now require me to explicitly change the type without actually changing the value. They were `bytes` before, and they're `bytes` now. They were sequences whose elements were bytes before, and they are sequences whose elements are bytes now. The type hasn't changed, just the syntax. `str` used to incorrectly be an alias for `bytes`; now it's the name of an actual string type which had awkwardly been called `unicode` (awkwardly because Unicode is not a special type of string, it's just the system we use to explain what characters are). &gt;So you can say I'm wrong (or even universally wrong), but this experience with python 3 leaves a bad taste in my mouth, and colors my opinion about it, and whether I'd recommend anyone port to it. How many LOC are we talking here? If I did the work for you, and you agreed that the result was elegant and reflected a superior, more proper distinction between bytes and text, would you be willing to compensate me in Reddit gold?
But I'll bet they'll only support python 2.4 with only the standard library and not allow imports of third-party packages or your own .py files. 
python has standards you know :P lol :D

I cant decide if this will make excel more usable, or if it will allow for new and more hideous forms of excel necromancy to occur in enterprise. I'm leaning toward the latter. 
Woa this looks right up my alley.
I didn't downvote anything and "dashed" describes accurately my excitement wavering when licensing came up in the show. I really like to use packages that are well thought out like this one and which are built in Python 3 exclusively. When I release code I use MIT, thats just my preference and unlike the "free loading companies" he describes in the show I do support the packages I use. Sometimes that is with a PR but most of the time i am helping others in the discuss or forums resolve their issues. It is fun most of the time and I like the challenge that their questions present. Yeah the AGPL works in some cases but to say that a network request went to a piece of software under AGPL and is now obligated to be open sourced is pretty burdensome i think. Some projects aren't the next facebook. I build small services on the side for a niche clientele which means not a lot of revenue. An additional $2000 on a service that brings in $6000 annually is a big cost to take on. Hell, after hosting costs its barely even profitable at that point. The alternative is to offer the application code to the client, who are lawyers in this case. Putting a little clause in the EULA saying they can get a copy of the code for the service I built for them doesn't really work does it? So, I am writing an APIStar celery component instead because i want async tasks and the license isn't as prescriptive. It all works out in my opinion and now the author has one less person contributing to his project and instead has me working on expanding functionality for his competitor. The result is "you" will have more options now in this space because of his choice, so no need to get upset about it.
This is a good idea.
IDLE. And then learn the command line well enough to navigate to C:\Users\Your_Username\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\Scripts to run pip from the command line. IDLE is far from the best IDE, but it is simple, has a debugger (unlike text editors), and requires zero configuration. Just press F5 to run the code. But feel free to move them to something else as soon as they want. Googling around to figure out environment setup is a pain no matter what age you are, but might as well rip that band aid off sooner than later.
Thanks for the offer but I am going to invest some time into celery for APIStar instead. When I work on a project that i can opensource I will probably revisit your package.

There's no way to make the AGPL license work for you commercially. You are supposed to choose the commercial license. If you think it's too expensive, fine, but that's quibbling about the price, not the license.
Ok so the price is too high and i am building an alternative. :P

Nice, a video that's literally just a bunch of text going by agonizingly slow. Turns out that video is the *worst* medium for sharing text. Who knew, right? 
if I was being taught python from scratch, I would have wished they explained to me how to run from command line and pass arguments. ides imo are often not needed and when used often are not utilised, they just make everything clunky. also getting some basic familiarity with a shell is good (even if it’s cmd). as for installing packages on windows, anaconda is the easiest but you can just use pip and refer to the python wheels for windows (google and it’s probably first link). 
I'm not sure I understand your point. I've also played the game...?
Sorry, on mobile atm, but more or less MTR (Mike's TraceRoute) does a traceroute and then runs ping tests to every spot along the way. Hmm. I'll have to think on it, I have some ideas but no computer in front of me right now.

It would be a wise move on their part.
Yeah, Jupyter Notebook or Spyder are probably the two most user friendly versions.
That would totally be the Old Microsoft way. But I really do think there is a New Microsoft Way at this point, They still might not do this, but, if they think it will improve their market share or street cred, they would definitely do it.
Literally the only thing you have to do in terminal for this is CD into the directory and type python &lt;filename.py&gt;

This topic has had quite a lot of coverage over the past few years. I had the same question and dug around a fair bit. You see answers ranging from "you don't need any" to "you need a phd to be competitive". You can get by with a very limited understanding of math if you just want to familiarise yourself with the relevant libraries and use what they offer. You hit a hard vertical wall of pretty advanced mathematics if you want to build your own however.

What about IDL?

IDL is generally used by the people who haven't discovered numpy yet :p I feel there's not much need for it anymore, because python is easier to use, and with numpy it's not any slower and can do just as much. Plus Python is extremely popular right now, so there's a lot of online support and a lot of students will have already learned it anyway. Also it's free and you don't need to worry about licences etc. IDL isn't horrible, but there's not much reason to choose it over Python when everybody already uses Python. Similarly with Matlab

It depends on what you mean by "demo". There's nothing preventing you from evaluating the library and, like I said elsewhere, you can get a free commercial license just by asking. 
I spoke a little bit about how it compares to Celery and RQ in the podcast. You can also find a comparison table here: https://dramatiq.io/motivation.html 
I think something like Spyder's probably good, too.
I've done quite a bit of VBA programming and find that it it gets bloated from all the wonky workarounds you have to do. The python version will be less than 1000 lines.
Malware creators cannot wait. 
that's super neat.
A couple reasons I can think of: * Better documentation: Microsoft simple has more resources to devote to documentation which will make something like this easier to use * Python becomes a standard solution: if you want to provide a workbook with advanced functionality, you have to either figure out how to do it native excel or with vba modules. To be able to send a file with a python script and have it automatically work without needing to install anything extra would be a godsend. 
&gt;I'm not sure if "%matplotlib notebook" provides the functionality out of the box, but you can probably enable it. It shows coordinates under the cursor. 
Hmmm well they were dependant on volunteers for the filming. It was a pretty amazing experience being there in person though!
But then you would have been deprived of the fun world of COM programming.
I've had success with [pyinstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/). The documentation is pretty easy to follow as well.
1: /r/learnpython 2: read the sidebar once you're there. plenty of learning resources listed.
Are you sure? Have you read VBA or seen what people do accomplish in Excel *without* VBA just using cell formulas? The worst case is that their documentation is awful again. Learning VBA was mostly a pain in the ass because the documentation was either inaccurate or plainly wrong on regular basis. So instead of trusting documentation you just declare everything as "variant" and after the fact step through your code to find the real datatype for the declaration. Also small throwaway vba code is actually still very readable but once you went in and added defensive measures, automatic scaling, error handling and so on, you end up with an unreadable mess of an alphabet soup. Debugging VBA often ends up just rewriting the routine/function the error is in. VBA breaks so easily and is hard to get right. Also no way of using VCS so you backup manually a bunch of files and rename them per hand... P.S.: Lived in Excel/VBA hell for years.
Google “python chinese ocr”, the first hit for me is a tensorflow implementation which sounds promising.
How popular were the other posts? This is the first one since the survey to actually make my front page. 
&gt; new and more hideous forms of excel necromancy to occur in enterprise The people who are going to do that are already doing that in VBA. 
One thing would be that a python user could write a bit of functionality for the excel user and the excel user could use that bit of functionality as if it were provided by excel, they wouldn't need to keep in jumping in and out of excel to use it.

At least with pyInstaller, they had a lot of issues with Python 3.6. I always use the latest master that's on github. https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller I thought most of those other projects are dead. &gt; I am running Python 3.6, and the ".exe" files these modules create only seem to work on my computer, not on anyone elses' That's a common problem that I run into with pyInstaller. Again, running with the master helps, but DLLs are often still missing. You have to manually include them. Turn on debugging so you can actually get the error message. As always, test your exe on another computer, preferably one without Python. Microsoft puts out 90 day VMs that you can test with https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/ &gt; I have tried watching dozens of YouTube tutorials, looked at 100s of examples, websites and forums and absolutely nothing works. That's way too many. Pick one and stick with it. I think I used like 3 examples to get things up and running my first time and I look at a new one each time pyInstaller breaks their format. pyInstaller is not a code where you can just try things blindly. You also need to tweak it to get working and using the spec file is really the best way to go. Read the 5000 lines of info/warning/error messages. Assume every warning is an error. Fix all the errors.
PyQt5 is so simple to take the example from and modify to whatever you want. You get the benefit of a WYSIWIG interface builder with the relatively simple python interface to interact with it.
The problem with this is that if they do, then whichever version of Python they use will be embedded in user files, and then their strict backwards-compatibility rules mean that they can never, ever, upgrade Python after that. (Because if they did, old spreadsheets would fail to work in new versions of Excel.) And then we all have to support that version of Python forever. So even if it doesn't start out as something awful like 2.4, it'll end up that way a decade from now. I hope they don't do this, or at least, I'm not going to be excited until I see what their plan is for addressing this issue.

I second PyCharm. You can hide the unnecessary things and introduce him to it one by one, or he even explores them himself.

I have been using cx_Freeze for a very long time, and it has worked reliably for me in most cases. Python 3.6 support only started with cx_Freeze 5.0.1, so you would want to make sure that you have the right version installed. I suspect that you are trying too many examples. I recommend you concentrate on one method, and dig into that. While I have been using cx_Freeze for a long time, there are occasional gotchas. I have not been able to successfully freeze a Django application. And, I had to mess around quite a bit to figure out the correct dlls to included with the frozen binary after cx_Freeze converted to new version of the Visual Studio compiler. (If you don't do that, you have to ensure that the user has the correct Microsoft Visual C++ runtimes installed.) But, it is very doable. What were the problems you were having with cx_Freeze?

Excellent, thank you its always helpful to review someone else's implementation. 
I use python 3.5 with pyinstaller and I make sure to read the entire log of the process because it will usually tell you what it includes and what it fails to include which gives a pretty good idea of how to fix any issues. One such issue was a little .json file that needed to be explicitly told to import from openpyxl.
A fairly improvement from "cherry branch". Enjoy and hack it !!! -_-
&gt; the spirit of python is that's supposed to be really loosely typed That shows that you haven't got a clue what you're talking about. &gt; If we're going that route, why not just make the whole language strongly typed? That confirms that you haven't got a clue what you're talking about. Python is, always has been, and always will be, strongly typed. When are people going to understand the difference between static and dynamic typing and weak and strong typing?
The more recent versions of Python 3 are faster than Python 2, the older versions were slower. Sorry, I'm feeling too lazy to find out when the cutover occurred :-)
It should be as easy as `pip install pytorch` from a command line prompt.
For a complete beginner, I don't imagine that they'd need to be changing the interpreter often, if indeed ever. And whilst I kind of agree with your second point (In my setup `^&amp;#x21E7;R` will run the active tab, but `^R` will run the last script you ran.) I don't think it's that much of a barrier. I'd also argue that for a beginner, PyCharm's debugger is much, much, nicer than using ipdb. Especially things like being able to set conditional breakpoints. Yeah, there's a bit of a learning curve, but I don't think it's that steep, and the pay off is definitely worth it. 
If that code works I'll eat my hat as you use `w` instead of `n` :-)
A simple tip is to give your collections plural names so you can write things like `for car in cars:` which makes things so easy to read.
altavista, bing, yahoo, duckduckgo or the other one whose name is on the tip of my tongue? :-)
Another possible cause of issues: conda. I had issues in combination with pyinstaller and python 3.5. I was successful with cx_freeze and python 2.7 (conda) on another project that included a Windows GUI using Qt. 
I entirely agree with the OP. Take for example that crap `requests` library by that idiot `Kenneth Reitz`. Why do we use such rubbish? And he has the audacity to call it `HTTP for Humans`, damned cheek!!!

In the past, I've always ended up using [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) to create a program that bundles the proper dll files as an MSI. You need to make sure you include those dlls so that all of the libraries are available and you need not have python installed on the remote machine (one of the dlls will be the python library). For recognizing and creating dlls, I believe I used py2exe in the past with _some_ success.
/r/learnpython Also, search for Miguel's mega tutorial on Flask.
May I ask what is your use-case and why do you need to build a .exe file ?
I'd highly recommend [pymysql](https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL). It's a pure python implementation and it works really well. We use it in [mycli](https://www.mycli.net) which is an alternative REPL for MySQL. So we put that library through the wringer to make sure all the MySQL functionalities are supported. It has served us well.

Confusing names I know but you should at least take a look at [pipwin](https://github.com/lepisma/pipwin) which *allows you to install compiled python libraries for windows provided by Christoph Gohlke* and [pip-win](https://sites.google.com/site/pydatalog/python/pip-for-windows) which *is a tiny Python Package manager that is super easy to install*. There is also [pip-gui](https://github.com/GDGVIT/pip-gui).
&gt; the windows command prompt suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucks Get [conemu](https://conemu.github.io/), it's excellent.
pip install MySQL-python
spyder I think is your best choice. Or Jupyter. 
I also never got it to work on Python 3.6. I have separate environment with python3.5 (32 bit) which does work for me. I'm sure that other people will tell you that other setups should work, but it wasn't my case
I have not used pyinstaller, but it does look like they support 3.6 now. Or, at least, they are advertising support.
Have you looked into plotly? [Plotly link] (https://plot.ly/products/dash/) this is a way of having interactive plotting and is becoming more widely used. 
mysqldb or sqlalchemy are both really good. 
thanks! will do :) 
Sharing .exe files is bad practice. PYthon ideology = sharing SCRIPTS not BINARIES. If your client host machine doesn't have python installed it is a flawed set up. `sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential` there are similar command for Arch also, Fedora. If your client is on Windows well it's not a good OS and i don't think it should be supported but if you are insisting on supporting Windows then your client do this. Install chocolatey (Windows package manager, think open and free, like Pacman and not a walled garden like the Windows 10 or Windows 8.1 or Windows 8 Store) I don't remember if it was in Windows 7 however last time I used Windows it was about 8 years ago my company just received the new Windows Server set ups despite my constant suggestions to move to Linux at the time, not popular. It was good though looking back didn't break so often now my nephew has a Windows 10 laptop and it often breaks and I have to repair it although it is due to the constant dismay of online insecurity (viruses, etc,). Back on topic though when you install chocolatey type `choko install python` onto the command line (might need to duckduckgo it to know how to open it as Windows is getting more locked down with each update! Never know when it's going to take away your registry key giving you access to the command prompt for end users. After that your clients will have an UP TO DATE and secure version of python able to run all your scripts it is a great workflow 
nah nobody can beat PHP in that area

Hello, was wondering you can help me out 
that looks really easy. Thanks!
Is it possible to parse the json file with json.load(fileobj)? If that is possible all nodes are unique. If not your file is probably not valid json. Keys of dictionaries can be integers and values can be lists or other dictionaries, so no worries there. It's hard to give more advice without seeing the json files.
I'm not sure I understand your case, but take a look at [marshmallow](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) library.
I love sqlalchemy
OOooooh, that could be really awesome idea. It's a public project; I'll message you the github and you can take a look at it and tell me how much gold you think the project would be worth. This might really work out. And if the final result is indeed elegant, without requiring a million hours of work, then I will publicly eat my words.
This seems neat, but I wrote this with curl and awk in about the time it took me to skim the article. This is overkill.
What's wrong with shipping binaries? Maybe OPs software is not open source. Maybe the application doesn't want to require Python to be installed. 
I enjoyed reading this article. How about a link to the full code? 
I'm also a vim user, just started learning Python. My understanding is that IDE's are really the way to go (pycharm is one I have seen recommended, and it's intellij, so you'll be able to get a vim-bindings extension, so it's not too, too far from home) 
You want /r/learnpython
This is a program I wrote using the Turtle module in Python 3.6.1 Most steps of the drawing are randomised using the Random module, such as the angle and height of each mountain, the number of trees, blades of grass, shape of lake, etc, so no execution of this program will produce quite the same picture. If you have any ideas for new parts or alterations, let me know and i'll try to implement them!
This is (IMO) the simplest and easiest way to connect the two. Having known only the basics of SQL, I was up and running in about half-an-hour. Can not recommend enough. 
Well that would be a problem in of it self because open source is the way the industry is moving forward. Not open source in our current decade is quite honestly hating freedom. Do you hate your users? It is a natural, born right for a person to have acccess to the source codes of their programs. Well not really I am exagerateing to make my point. I feel like there is a war coming between the big companies like Micorosoft and Google ready to lock down wallet garden our free speech as users while smaller ones are stepping up and open source software is growing ever more popular. Just last week I convinced someone in my friend group to install Firefox Quantum (open source) the new browser by Mozilla Firefox as opposed to using Chrome with has tons of closed source components and could be stealing our data,. We can't allow this to happen as as such I WILL look with disgust at a person who ships closed source binaries without the source code in the same .zip file and if that happened In my company it would be prompty reported, just my thoughts
There is so much wrong with your wall of text, I don't even know where to begin.
Ah, to be young again ;) You're views will change and mature once you graduate College.
It requires two manual steps (Adding Who is Hiring Story ID, and Locations to search for), and so I think it's best explored in REPL like iPython. Copy pasting blocks of code in that order, should work and is pretty easy to do. Give it a shot in iPython **pip install ipython** **ipython** Then just copy/paste 
Possibly ... What do you need help with? Note that I do not have access to Learn Python the Hard Way.
 a = json.load(file) throws AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'read' The nodes are unique i guess, its just that i have an objects "refere" and "player" and they both have identical properties "Name" and "Surname" 
I had a look at the repository and AFAICT, the actual `ord` calls are confined to a single source file. I don't really understand the details of most of what the rest of the project is supposed to do (in particular, there's a lot of file I/O and I'm uncertain of the intended format of the files being operated on). But I'll certainly go over that file, and probably apply some other refactoring as well. Respectfully, I think your standards for "tight, clean" Python code are a bit low ;)
Would you mind sharing your code?
Looks great! Would love to see the code. Well done 
what about json.load(open(filepath))?
I wouldn't mind seeing that code if at all possible
I set up my then-11-yo with a Raspberry Pi running Kano distro and got the Python for Kids book. It came with IDLE. He used it for a while but it had its quirks. I later came across Thonny which was a much nicer basic IDE. Pycharm is way overkill for beginners. I've also got a BBC Microbit board which can be programmed with python so he can pretty much run anything. He was crazy about sports stats so I showed him how to download raw data, store it, etc. that helped drive the learning. However, be forewarned that with kids their interests come and go. Shortly after all this he got interested in making videos and dropped using python. The stuff is there and he goes back to it every once in a while. There's no pressure to dive in. These things are a means to an end. If they find an interesting problem and the desire to solve it they'll use it.
The following features are available now: - You can recursively exclude all identifiers of certain modules from obfuscation. - You can exclude human readable configuration files containing Python code. - You can use getattr, setattr, exec and eval by excluding the identifiers they use. - You can even obfuscate module file names and string literals. - You can run your obfuscated code from any platform. - Possibiliy to specify input dir, output dir and config file - reasonable defaults provided for all configuration settings - Pep8_comments option added - Support for obfuscation of names starting with __ added -License changed from QQuickLicense to Apache 2.0 
I'm assuming Lst_PossibleAnswers is the same as Lst_Results. You can shorten everything in the for loop - you don't need to measure each substring and add them up, you can just measure the length of the string you've already combined: for iCombinationLength in range(1, 30): for aCombination in itertools.product(tpl_Char, repeat=iCombinationLength): str_Combination = ''.join(aCombination) if len(str_Combination) == Width_TargetText: Lst_PossibleAnswers.append(str_Combination) print("&gt; Adding " + str_Combination + " to Lst_PossibleAnswers with a value of " + str(tmp_sum) + ") else: print("&gt; Rejecting " + str_Combination + " with a non-matching value of " + str(tmp_sum)) 
no, I think I was using a list to store the combination, because I needed to keep each character separately so I could calculate the widths - for example, if AabC would be stored as: Lst_Results[0] = A Lst_Results[1] = a Lst_Results[2] = b Lst_Results[3] = C so I could then find the correct width; so if Lst_Results[x] == tpl_Char[x] therefore the width of Lst_Results[x] must be tpl_Width[x]
oh my god, wait you're right, I don't need to calculate each thing!
oh no wait, see when I was talking about the width of the target text? I meant as in, each character has it's own real-life length - so A might be 2, B might be 3, a 1, and so on and so forth
 UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xed in position 814: invalid continuation byte Im on debian linux if it matters, but i do not think this error is related to the problem im trying to tackle. 
I'm IDLE you can just hit f5 to run
Currently looking into it, thanks.
oh yea, absolutely. good call
I'm just working on a really basic program for my computational physics classwork. I am going to create a model of an ecoli cell on a surface being bombarded with UVC light. I want to eventually build on this program to simulate UVC disinfection with a variety of concentrations of bacteria. Wish me luck!
Try solving the project euler problems,it contains mathematical problems solvable only through the use of a computer.
 curl -ik https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/$CUR/ -o - 2&gt; /dev/null | grep '&lt;span id="quote_price"' | awk -F'data-usd' ' { print $2 } ' | tr -d '=' | tr -d '"' | tr -d '&gt;' a little more than just $(curl | awk) but this was quicker than trying to get fancy with the regex in awk.
I was curious this one time so I used IronPython to create a WPF app that [timed Portal 2 demos](https://bitbucket.org/nick_timkovich/portal-2-live-timer/src). Worked reasonably well and I could distribute a single-file text application to users after they did some setup gymnastics. It's fairly rare, so maybe contributed to the perception it was harder.
Pymysql has been doing me proud for years It’s also a drop in replacement for Mysqldb from python 2 It also makes your code nicely portable to non x86 operating systems like raspberry pi etc Really good, lots of people using it, and an active community to help with questions ;-) 
Do not use that library, it's been replaced by `pip install mysqlclient`.
Have you set the encoding in the file read to be utf8 ? 
Ok so I've managed to solve it! Putting it on here incase someone like me is trying to find an example of how to do it - for iCombinationLength in range(1, 30): for aCombination in itertools.product(tpl_Char, repeat=iCombinationLength): str_Combination = ''.join(aCombination) tmp_sum = 0 for k in range(0, len(aCombination), 1): for i in range(0, nCharacters, 1): if aCombination[k] == tpl_Char[i]: tmp_sum = tmp_sum + tpl_Width[i] if tmp_sum == Width_TargetText == 0: Lst_PossibleAnswers.append(str_Combination) print("&gt; Adding " + str_Combination + " to Lst_PossibleAnswers with a value of " + str(tmp_sum) + ")") elif tmp_sum != Width_TargetText: print("&gt; Rejecting " + str_Combination + " with a non-matching value of " + str(tmp_sum)) else: print("&gt; Error for string " + str_Combination + "with a non-matching value of" + str(tmp_sum))
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mysqlclient I have been playing around quite a lot with Python and MySQL databases lately, I ended up using mysqldb (on ubuntu u can download it with the apt package manager). I have not used any other solutions, since this worked perfectly for me. Mostly been creating databases and fetching data from queries.
I'd love to see the code.
Oh boy This would boost my career opportunities a lot I hope do they do move forward on this idea
When computers are better at drawing art than you are 
Or cmder, conemu with custom settings and git pre-installed 
Also super important if you're deploying your code to AWS lambda. The pure python implementation means it's no problem. Probably also an issue in other serverless situations, but definitely AWS lambda.
&gt; We can easily extend what we've done for the 2D histogram to calculate 3D histogram... Unfortunately we cannot visualize this histogram. Why not? Couldn't you just create a 3D image?
Something like Seaborn, a library that helps you present data.
https://github.com/tg12/IG-Index-Scalping-Scraping-Bot In the UK, The most popular broker is IG Index, part of the IG Group. I have been working on a scalping bot for stocks/shares or whatever instruments and it is yielding good results. 
Use `datetime.datetime.now()`. Also, /r/learnpython is a better subreddit for questions like these.
Oh this is so cool. I wish there were more projects that would use the turtle module to do more advance and programmatic things like this just for the fun of it. I did something like that where I created a 3d wireframe renderer using turtle just to see if I could do it.
Keep up the good work! Python is awesome. I have been feeling stagnant lately so I decided to learn either Powershell or Python. I have learned a heck of a lot in the last few months. 
&gt; hates libraries that appear mysterious &gt; can't spell fucking The irony, it's expontentially.
Just noticing it doesn't support my exchanges. I might have to dig in and see if I can add them myself.
&gt; We can't allow this to happen as as such I WILL look with disgust at a person who ships closed source binaries without the source code in the same .zip file and if that happened In my company it would be prompty reported, just my thoughts LOL...
Definitely put this code on Github! If you don't know how, I can help you, just PM or chat me :)
Okay, you can still improve this in a couple of ways. First, store all of the char widths in a dictionary instead of iterating through all of them each time. And secondly, there is no way to hit the 'else' part of you "tmp_sum == ..." conditional. Either the two values are equal or not. Lst_Results = [] #tpl_Char and tpl_Width are tuples, where each item is either a character "A", "B", "C",..., #or the width of the character as a numeric string. #nCharacters is the number of characters to be that can be combined # len(tpl_Char) == nCharacters #Width_TargetText is the width of the unknown text string that we're trying to to discover # charWidths is a dict mapping characters to their widths charWidths = {char: width for char, width in zip(tpl_Char and tpl_Width)} for iCombinationLength in range(1, 30): for aCombination in itertools.product(tpl_Char, repeat=iCombinationLength): str_Combination = ''.join(aCombination) tmp_sum = sum(charWidths[char] for char in aCombination) if tmp_sum == Width_TargetText: Lst_Results .append(str_Combination) print("&gt; Adding " + str_Combination + " to Lst_PossibleAnswers with a value of " + str(tmp_sum) + ")") else: print("&gt; Rejecting " + str_Combination + " with a non-matching value of " + str(tmp_sum)) I'm using comprehensions here to condense code onto a single line. The summing could be rewritten as : tmp_sum = 0 for char in aCombination: charWidth = charWidths[char] tmp_sum += charWidth Also, iterating over indices is usually not the best way to do something in Python. If you need to iterate over multiple lists at the same time, you can use the [zip](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip) function like I did initializing charWidths. I should also mention that there are definitely more efficient ways to solve this problem, this is the naive way - just generate possible strings and see if they are the same length. One way would be to set up the problem recursively: def find_permutations_of_width(char_widths, width): """Generate strings of a specific width. Args: char_widths: A mapping of valid characters to their widths width: The width of strings we want to generate. """ for char, char_width in char_widths.items(): for trailing_string in find_permutations_of_width(char_widths, width - char_width): yield char + trailing_string
Learning myself and never heard of these sites. Will be sure to check them out!
uhhh... load(open(filepath, encoding='utf-8'))?
I made a simple Finite-state machine (FSM) for the Python Arcade library, which is basically just a modernised alternative to Pygame. https://github.com/TDuffin/Arcade-State-Machine It's just a simple demoscene but you can expand upon it with your own games/whatever.
Ditto, I'd love to try adding in to this. 
Please share the code this, would be amazing to toy around with! 
That's not really the question, and if you really are comparing IDEs to Vim, you probably aren't a user of the Vim features that do matter and make it a phenomenal _editor_. Most vi/Vim-like plugins I've seen don't come close. - All the text objects? - All the motions? - _All_ the scrolling commands, not just some. - All the actions? - The macro system? - The full register system? - The input customization? - The spell checker (this isn't a joke)? - The split/tab/buffer management (not all IDEs have splits, hidden open files, etc.)? When you forget some, I can guarantee that you _really_ piss off that competent Vim user.
Not sure overall or in comparison to your other subs, but it was at or near the top of /r/python 
I usually hear of people just using YouCompleteMe (uses Jedi), or some other framework (deople, etc.), instead of generating tag files manually. It's not perfect, but that really depends on your workflow. Do you explore libraries through autocompletion? You could generate `tags` files, but what about C extension modules, `namedtuple`s (hello `eval`!), and the more-flexible-than-`ctags`-understands namespacing?
This is like the graphics in ‘The Hobbit’ adventure game on the ZX Spectrum back in the 80’s. Thanks for the nostalgic reminder!
Saaaame. I’d love to send a link to my students. 
Give Nuitka (http://nuitka.net/doc/user-manual.html) a try. It doesn't bundle .py/.pyc files, instead, it compiles Python code down to libpython native calls, and also optimizes it a bit.

Just recorded the screen as the turtle was drawing, then sped up around 8x in Vegas Pro, then rendered and converted to gif online
Aaah I like it!
I do not remember where I found this, but I make a small article for myself, maybe it will be useful for someone. http://blog.sentyaev.net/2017/05/30/install-python-in-ubuntu.html
Oh man! This is awesome! I didn't know about the turtle module. But back in the 80s and early 90s, I did a bunch of Logo programming in school. Then, for christmas one year, my dad bought me Logo for our home computer. It came with a nice manual. Thanks for sharing!
Good article. Probably, instead of just displaying the list, you could have displayed the statistics/market cap in graphs. 
That's great, you could make some unique personalised christmas cards that way! Just add snow and some random christmas decorations!
you want json.loads(your_string_here) if you are using a string
&gt; mysqldb Not if you're on Python 3.
Good point, didn't realize it wasn't supported.
God damn class-based views and their stupid context datas and crap that just make your code twice as big and more confusing than simply using function based views...
We have [a pretty long list of learning resources in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index#wiki_new_to_programming.3F). Try a few and see what resonates. For a brand new programmer I'd recommend codecademy. Also, if you don't have one already make sure you look for a project that interests you and start on it as soon as you can. Programming is a lot more fun if you have a goal. Come visit us in /r/learnpython if you get stuck.

If Flask or Pyramid came with an auth system as powerful as Django's I would be so happy.
Hey, would there be a way to get rid of watermarks? And while browsing it on mobile, I couldn't use the scrollbar in the bottom when it appears (Chrome). Also the final video goes out of the website and the half-transparent popular tags tab is blocking a part of the video.
Heh. I put about 6 hours into this (including some study of the underlying protocols) and my head hurts - there's stuff in there that seems like it *has* to be buggy, just in ways that are subtle enough that tests might easily not have noticed. That said, the only real point of confusion is in terms of expecting strings vs. bytes from the end user (the 3.x `socket` library expects numeric IPs to be strings, but usernames and passwords specified for the proxies should probably be bytes so that the user can explicitly encode them, and also it's unclear what encoding should be used when passing ) But all of these are problems fundamental to the domain, not things Python caused. To get a clearer understanding, I strongly recomment [Ned Batchelder's overview]. That said, the simplest low-hanging fruit: # many lines that superficially resemble: if authstat[0:1] != chr(0x01).encode(): # should become if authstat[0] != 1: # The .encode() call is actually wrong and potentially dangerous; # in 2.x, it implicitly decodes the result of chr(0x01) # (which was *already* a byte) into a string, which then # is encoded back into bytes - both times with a "system default" # encoding that is probably not what you want. # In 3.x, `chr` produces a real string, equivalent to 2.x `unichr`; # the easiest way to get a proper `bytes` object with that # single byte with a value of 1 is to use a literal: `b'\x01'`. # However, instead of comparing `bytes`, it's easier to # compare individual byte values. Fundamentally, the code # is interested in a single element of `authstat`, and its value # (in 3.x) is an integer. # This one is especially broken: if chosenauth[1] == chr(0xFF).encode(): # In 3.x, we are now comparing a single (integer) element # of a `bytes`, to an entire `bytes` object, so that can never match. # But more importantly, we really do want the exact byte # 0xff according to the standard, not the result of any # particular encoding. Even in 2.x this should have compared # to `'\xff'` (remembering that 2.x `str` and `bytes` are the same!); # in 3.x it should compare to `0xff`. # A few lines of the general form: self.sendall(struct.pack('BBBB', 0x05, 0x02, 0x00, 0x02)) # can just specify that data with a byte literal directly: self.sendall(b'\x05\x02\x00\x02') 
How is sqlalchemy in any way a good solution when all I want to do is write a script to run some queries?
I have limited exposure with it. Used it for a school project and that was all, just know that it has a lot of capabilities. Thought it was worth looking into.

Quick tip: Format code as code or link to pastebin, gist, etc
With [stash](https://github.com/ywangd/stash) you can attempt to pip install modules but not all of them work. Pythonista is great though. It's the only thing that's keeping me from switching back to android.
Hmm, if I understand correctly, the image you have attached will also work with your idea. This idea is based on the first Euclid axiom saying that in a 2-d space, a straight line is the shortest path between two points. (my words). So, indeed to evaluate the "straightness" of line, you simply need to verify that the distance between 2 points is equal to the sum of all the line segments. 
Appreciate the feedback. We do agree the watermark is ugly... its a placeholder at the moment. We are going to replace it with a smaller and better looking one. The watermarks are to help advertise our site, so they will likely stay. Gotta advertise somehow =) As for mobile, we dont expect it to work yet. We know it is a mess. Curious, what did you think of the site besides those issues? Did you try uploading your own clips or uploading via URL? 
Once he gets his foot in a bit, chuck Linux at them it really improves problem solving, research (SO), typing speed, etc. Python is also brilliant on Linux. Don't use Ubuntu or another windoze like distro, they'll never learn anything if its just like Win10.
I’m teaching myself the language but focusing on a project to use api to capture stock data. The trick is most stock api do not include dividend data which is where I am focused. I found an api source through iex I think will work so now I am trying to learn writing to CSV for deeper analysis in excel.
I like to work with turtle, but I often find that it takes a long time to draw complex images/layers. What you/viewers might not know about/how to use is the tracer function. (You probably do judging by your familiarity with turtle) It let's the turtle work invisibly until it is done, and the screen only refreshes when you call turtle.update() . This can make drawings that would take minutes take seconds, or seconds instantaneous. Nice work!
I was waiting for the send nudes part. Dissapointed.
Did I explain the issue properly though? if there were a *bunch* of tiny jags, they would add a lot of distance but in reality it is actually fairly straight. Picture this: you have a triangle wave generator with *really* high frequency but low amplitude. You get a *ton* of segments that add together to be a lot, even though it's actually pretty straight. Does that explain it better? 
Was on mobile where it would be of course uncomfortable to do (so actually the site doesn't need to be really mobile optimized cause nobody will really download/edit videos on mobile devices anyway ... usually). But I do think that watermarks will make people less likely to use your site especially when they are huge and with an ugly font as they are right now, so perhaps add a way to get rid of it - either by registering, adding *n* clips to the site, just politely asking to add a credit/link somewhere or even placing it behind a paywall. On a second thought though, people will probably not use it for anything 'professional' anyway and edit everything by themselves.
Two things: first, the proper place for this question would be /r/learnpython. Second, the 'or' operator doesn't do what you think it does. You're trying to use it in the sense of whether a value is one of a set of values, and there's a completely different idiom for that. For example, if I wanted to check to see if x was 1, 2 or 3, I could write: if x == 1 or x == 2 or x ==3: Of course the more Pythonic way of expressing all of this would be: if x in (1,2,3): or: if x in range(1,4): 
He also has even more syntax errors - single ='s and a semicolon
Another option is pyenv (https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv). The upside is you get version management and easy switching which can be controlled on a per directory basis for projects. There's also pyenv-virtualenv to take it one step further for venv management within pyenv. 
Yeah, Wes and the author of this article got into a little heated discussion on Twitter a few weeks ago.
Thank you for sharing the code, I love this!
Average absolute distance from the ideal straight line?
Whenever I run a completed script for the first time I always have Bob Ross tell me mentally "Here's your bravery test!"
The use of a kwargs parameter to channels_list_by_id is suspect in that kwargs delivers a dict and your code treats it as a list. The error message refers to a line in your code: tasks = results.get(['items'],['snippet'],['title'], []) Does that look familiar to you? I can't find it in the code you posted. 
I think he shares what I was also thinking: we don't think pinging the Dota 2 website gives an accurate representation of network quality in game, as they don't host the website on the game servers that the client connects to.
I was being kind. Start small and build from there.
That seems like a good idea. But can you tell me what good does pinging each hop do? For example, pinging `sgp-1.valve.net` gives me an average of `100ms`, but doing a traceroute on it (for me) won't show any hops (so no addresses show) but the latency is still `100ms`, so I doubt the results of traceroute have any significant effect on ping (but I may be entirely wrong here, so feel free to correct me.)
I would survey a number of presentations from the PyCon and PyData conferences. I would especailly recommend anything by Brandon Rhodes for data manipulation with pandas and Jupyter. see http://pyvideo.org/speakers.html 
Get the middle line from a linear regression then sum the distance between it and the points. If a line turning back on itself is bad I have no idea.

I'm not talking about the website. I literally say, right here: &gt; reliable test would be a small file transfer from their **game servers** Game Servers. Not their website. The valve-hosted page is multihosted anyway, so it wouldn't matter what it returned because it would be different for everyone. I'm talking about timing the response of a file served from the game host infrastructure. 
Assuming Windows download and install Python 3 https://www.python.org/downloads/ Then start this https://automatetheboringstuff.com/
All you need is a python interpreter and a text editor. Just go to python.org and download it.
See /r/learnpython as well
What exactly does it make it "fairly straight"? The existence of a pattern? Or that both are on the same hight? Or that the "signal" is bound tightly to a straight line? Maybe a bit more detailed explanation on what is that you want to detect could help. 
Do I need prior knowledge of computer programming to learn and master python ? ʘ‿ʘ
Could you share/explain how you implemented a dependency walker that worked for you? I've run into this a few times in the past and sort of "stumbled" my way to an answer but I'd love to hear more about a cleaner process/way
Yes depending on your signal all MAE, MAPE, RMSE between your signal and the straight line, could be used to show you how close to the straight line your signal is. 
No, Python is an excellent first language to learn.
I'm legit tearing up. This is it. Python is my life. 
Not at first but an understanding of basic data structures is going to become a necessity pretty fast. 
&gt;basic data structures Go on... What is that 😄😊 if you don't mind me asking good sir. 
Thanks!
Nah it's fine, don't worry about it. You'll learn all of it implicitly as you learn Python. 
Okay, I did some digging in my site-packages folder and found two versions of pyinstaller so I deleted both and did a fresh 'pip install pyinstaller'. It got the latest pyinstaller, I ran the pyinstaller command suggested on the github page and no errors occured. It created a folder called __pycache__ and in it the file Calculator.cpython-36.pyc (my file being Calculator.py). Is this the '.exe' file that users would run on their computers even without Python installed or is there another process I need to go through using this newly created file to create a .exe file?
Oh, yes, that's true. But you also said doing an HTTP GET request on their default website could work: that's probably what he meant by "it's not a browser game."
Great work. Very creative. But boy do you have a lot of repeated code. Make more functions. 
If you have the points of the line in in 2d space, maybe it would work to find a minimum bounding-box and use its aspect ratio? Possibly using something like the [`minAreaRect`](https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/imgproc/doc/structural_analysis_and_shape_descriptors.html?highlight=boundingrect#minarearect) function in opencv? In the end, you may need to use some composite method get what you really want, but I guess it depends on your application.
Say you are writing a program that will solve some problem (the problem isn't important in this example). You have a choice to use a tuple or a list. An understanding of mutability and which data structures are mutable would be helpful. Obviously you can learn this through trial and error but approaching your learning through a mix of practice and theory help that learning curve. 
So first of all, fun fact: You can use Dependency Walker on a .py file as well... But the gist of it is you open your exe/py file that crashes under the assumption that is is now crashing because it cannot find one of its dependencies, often a .dll file. So when opened you scroll through the neverending list of required Modules, until one has a red error saying its not found. Then you manually find it and either add that location to your system path (not very good for distributing), or you place that .Dll file in with your .exe file, or somewhere you know is already in your system path,C:/python27, (once again not very good for distributing). That's really all the usage I know of it, but by knowing what dll is missing and adding it to the package, many headaches are saved.
Blockchain development service is intended to capacitate corporate partners, clients, and developers to venture with distributed journal technology by offering them a cloud-based, single-click blockchain developer environment. It is a rising movement for public organizations, businesses, and industries to spontaneously make and authenticate transactions and thus reducing money and decreasing the potential for fraud.
We disabled the watermarks. They are too ugly at the moment.
Can you quote it? If you're referring to &gt; their default page or something I'm talking about an apache or iis default page, which has a small static page with a 404 or something that would show when you try to connect to port 80/443 on the game servers. Very commonly, developers add a web service to their hosts and set ACL's so that the world sees 404's while they can load a grafana dashboard or something. Basically, though, it would download static content and measure the jitter to know when there's a shift in connectivity to the specific game servers in question, which is a far more reliable source of connectivity information than ping.
I'd recommend RMOTR.com. They're real solid over there.
Numba is still closely tied to LLVM version though, right? Getting the right LLVM and Numba versions is 50% of the headache. Remembering to build Numba with the environment variable for the LLVM_CONFIG is the other half.
&gt; &gt; Picture this: you have a triangle wave generator with really high frequency but low amplitude. You get a ton of segments that add together to be a lot, even though it's actually pretty straight. Does that explain it better? So convert to the frequency domain first and filter the signal of the high frequency noise.
On quick review seems pretty interesting, contains lot of code samples. One suggestion I would have is to take some real world problem with mid to high complexity and give a walkthrough from both Algorithm and Implementation prespective. All in all great work 👍
Note the bit in the Misc section of the [FAQ](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/wiki/FAQ) about no packages that use `pkg_resources` being supported. You've just stepped into the least pleasant part of bundling/freezing. I'd suggest asking the PyInstaller devs directly. Basically you'll need to modify the spec file to include all your resources, and your resource access to use the bundled path, but I've never tried it with PyGame specifically.
This [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodness_of_fit#Regression_analysis) on goodness of fit might help,wher you are after a goodness of fit measurement to a line.
In general I'd love to see more real world examples of algorithms used in tools we use every day (outside of the sorting algorithms)
That would be nice, but unfortunately an nmap scans shows that valve doesn't actually put any web services in their game servers. Typing it in the browser shows nothing, and netcat as well as telnet won't connect to port 80 or port 443.
I believe that the wheels are pre-built and self-contained, i.e., they already include the right LLVM and are set up to use it automatically.
That's really what you'll be learning while you follow the tutorial. When you're _learning to program in python_, the _in python_ part is relatively easy. It's the _learning to program_ part that's difficult. A person who knows how to program can switch from one language to another in not much time at all. It will take you maybe several months to learn your first programming language, and maybe a week to learn your second.

"Why are we still here? Just to suffer? Every night, I remember print keyword… and integer division… even xrange. The hours I’ve lost… the sanity I've lost… won’t stop hurting… It’s like they’re all still there. You feel it, too, don’t you?”
I think I'll need some time to wrap my head around this.
I made a quick [RSA implementation](https://github.com/mcdallas/rsa) the other day to learn how it works and I used the secrets module to generate key pairs
That's awesome! Little tip - you'll never get notified about comments on a gist, so it might be good to make a repo and point the gist to it instead...
Try nuitka --portable. Never fails me on Linux, at least.
Regex is an incredibly powerful tool and would absolutely take care of this for you but there is a simpler method built right into Python's string object. my_string = "Hello there how are you?" my_cleaned_string = my_string.strip('"') Note I have passed a double quotation mark as an argument to `.strip()`. https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/string_strip.htm 
Wow I didn't know about that, I'd probably use that for the whole testing period then get rid of it for the satisfying reveal at the end!
Ok thanks, will do. I've never really used Github for uploading before someone suggested it on this thread!
Without knowing the exact format of the file you are trying to parse, to me it seems like a csv file with the text qualifier being " and the separator being , Use the csv module and specify the two symbols to parse properly. 
With open(filename) as f: For line in f.readlines(): Quotes=line.split('”') #quotes is now an array of stuff between "s.

I would make sure to stay far from Ubuntu and Unity - it's made to be easy to learn, Debian [imo] is more "raw" and difficult but would teach you more. Source: 15 y/o who learned python at 12 and wiped windoze at 11.
 with open('file.txt', 'r') as f: sentences = [sentence.lstrip('"') for sentence in f.read().split('",')]
Each segment can be described as a line KX+B. You can measure all K and B coefficients and compute variance of them. Variance of coefficients for the first line will be 0 and the 3rd one will have high variance. 
You can build a linear regression model for these points and measure mean square error
I will add that to my amazon wish list. Too bad its still py2 oh well should be helpful still.
Well, YouCompleteMe is indeed to auto-completion, I just want a way to read package code if I need to debug some issue for example, so I want an easy way to go to the method definition I'm using. Yes, It's a good point. A lot of the base libraries are indeed in C and just stubs in Python. I guess it's indeed not that useful in Standard Library, but is on pip packages.
I used pycharm for a while, but the vim-binding is that that good in my own opinion. Mainly, because it only work on the editor - when you open debugger window for example, you have to turn off the vim-binding or not be able to do anything.

if it's json, use the proper tool for the job: ``json.loads`` and get the correct data from the resulting list/ dictionary.
ok I tried with that but it just writes everything in the new txt file.. import sys import os import json with open('/Users/james/Downloads/dataser/train.json', 'r') as f: sentences = [sentence.lstrip('"') for sentence in f.read().split('",')] with open('/Users/james/Downloads/dataser/train.txt', 'a') as f: f.write(str(sentences) +'\n') 
oh thank you, I never used it 'cause this is the first time I need to extract data from a json file, actually this is how the json is structured: "question": "what's the weather like today?", I have lots of questions like this with other useless datas. can you at least give me a lil example on the json.loads usage? thanks :) 
Ok I managed to extract all the questions, but they are all on the same line, i need them to be every one on his line. I tried with the '\n' but it's not working (and I think I know why but I dunno how to fix that) with open('/Users/james/Downloads/dataser/train.json') as input_file: data = json.load(input_file) data = [d["question"] for d in data] with open('/Users/james/Downloads/dataser/train.txt', 'a') as f: f.write(str(data) +'\n')
Did you write this with LaTeX? I think you have to compile it again, because the references to listings are like this "Listing ??"
`sentences` is a list, that's pretty much everything what you need in Python. What you want from the outcome, those sentences? Btw, `sentence.strip().lstrip('"')` would get rid of endofline too... 
Any python only modules should work - unfortunately things like pandas do not work though. If I could use Pandas with it, I could use my iPad for so much more.
What's wrong with using a super simple mean square error score based on your line and its linear regression?
It depends on how heavy the application is. You can optimize as much as you want, both in python and C. You can py2exe to hide your source code and distribute the application, without leaking the sources. 
I don't recall a quick and dirty shortcut in Vim. In the general case though, if under `IPython`, doing `thePackage.theMethod??` will show that to you. You could try using the programmatic `get_magic` function IIRC, or use `inspect.getsourcefile` or `getsourcefiles`, and making a quick and dirty helper out of that.
There should really be a plugin/module extending pyinstaller to do those steps you mentioned above. I've wrote a few packaging scripts that automate some items -- has made pyinstaller a breeze and pleasure to work with

A work around for what exactly? The curses module is for building terminal applications. If you want to use curses you have to be running in a terminal that supports it.
I migrated from PHPStorm, back to Vim for exactly this reason. I miss the refactoring tools, but just the fact that *it's so slow* (the IDE and the vim bindings), I couldn't do it anymore. I'm still new to Python in particular, but I'm still trying to get Vim to work for me. 
fantastic job 
My favourite alteration so far
Cool. I brought my towel.
Oh sorry I tried different things to fix it and I probably put the wrong error. 
Any particular plugins that you have found so far? At this point, I've just use Ultisnips and that gets me 40% of the way, just need to take some time to get the rest configured.
I have no idea what the kwargs thing does tbh it was just there in the youtube api example so left it in. 
If it's a math-heavy program, I'd first implement it in Python, then move the math into a C library (to use with ctypes) for a huge performance boost. Then, if it is still too slow (in my opinion, at least), I rewrite it in C. For example (self-shilling ahead), recently I wrote a program which generates sound from descriptions of wave files. It involves hundreds of thousands of `math.sin()` calculations. For a sample input, with 32.5 seconds of audio on an Intel Core 2 Duo (~2 GHz), Language | Time (seconds) --------|-------------- Pure Python3 | 2.7 Python3 with math in C | 0.7 C | 0.1 Source code: [PySoundGen (Pure Python3)](https://github.com/bharadwaj-raju/PySoundGen) and [SoundGen (C)](https://github.com/bharadwaj-raju/SoundGen).

This doesn't work for me on windows because you do path manipulation using strings for Unix with "/" for directories, while windows uses "\\" . I think there are modules for proper handling of paths, haven't done anything alike though
Pastebin the full original JSON file and show us the exact output format you want. What do you mean, "it's not working"? What do you expect to be happening? What is actually happening?
I gave this a quick glance, and it looks really cool for Gmail, but does it work with Office 365? That is what my company uses and I'm restricted to that. However, I have some personal stuff I'm working on and I'll look into this for those tasks.
&gt; Any ideas? Nope, that's really weird. Make sure you're using the latest pip, I guess, and that your pip executable and pip module match (easiest way is to run `python -m pip install ...` instead of plain `pip install ...`). But it that still doesn't work I'd open an issue on pip.
Yep. Have a look at the os.path module, OP. Specifically _os.path.join()_. https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html
I even avoid os.path and strictly use the Pathlib module ....I've had the best luck with with Pathlib for having consistent behavior across platforms.
Is Pathlib in the default library?
As of Python 3.4+ https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0428/

i do use the py command tho 
Show us the full command and full error you are getting. 
Looking for Django expert in Guadalajara, Mexico to work for www.contractroom.com. 6+ years of Django. Please pm for details
The error is in spanish tho, but it means the same C:\Users\DH&gt;cd E:\cupp-master C:\Users\DH&gt;cupp3.py -i "cupp3.py" no se reconoce como un comando interno o externo, programa o archivo por lotes ejecutable.
Ok, so change it to C:\Users\DH&gt;py cupp3.py -i 
getting this tho can't open file 'cupp3.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
pretty neat, but it seems you've pretty much abandoned pep8 there
Where is that 'cupp3.py' file? If it's in another directory you need to provide the path. For instance: C:\Users\DH&gt;py E:\cupp-master\cupp3.py -i 
oh i see what i did wrong, wait a sec pls
Got it!!! Thank you so much for your help! 
Code every day and never delete this. Come back to it in a year and see how much you have progressed. `Lego_Scan_loop.py` can serve as your reference point.
Im getting this weird thing, what is it? File "C:\Users\DH\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\lib\configparser.py", line 1138, in _unify_values sectiondict = self._sections[section] KeyError: 'years' During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred: Traceback (most recent call last): File "E:\cupp-master\cupp3.py", line 723, in &lt;module&gt; main() File "E:\cupp-master\cupp3.py", line 48, in main read_config() File "E:\cupp-master\cupp3.py", line 109, in read_config 'years': config.get('years', 'years').split(','), File "C:\Users\DH\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\lib\configparser.py", line 781, in get d = self._unify_values(section, vars) File "C:\Users\DH\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\lib\configparser.py", line 1141, in _unify_values raise NoSectionError(section) configparser.NoSectionError: No section: 'years'
Does the allData var within the census2010 contain a key called AK? The error makes it sound like it doesn't. 
Just make it one dimensional and write a function that converts x, y to a 1-dimensional address, eg. 0, 0 is 0 and 8, 8 is 80. Then make another function for pretty printing, pretty inputting, etc. 
That error message says that the program tried to read a "years" value from a "years" section in the config file, but the config file has no section named "years". 
&gt; This doesn't work for me on windows because you do path manipulation using strings for Unix with "/" for directories, while windows uses "\" It shouldn't make a blind bit of difference, Python should handle this situation just fine.
Shall we crucify him now or later?
No the program writes allData = {'WY': {'Weston': {'pop': 3894, 'tracts': 1}}} to the file for some reason. The code that writes the imported information is as follows: import openpyxl,os,pprint wb = openpyxl.load_workbook('censuspopdata.xlsx') sheet = wb.get_sheet_by_name('Population by Census Tract') CountyData = {} for row in range(2,sheet.max_row + 1): state = sheet['B' + str(row)].value county= sheet['C' + str(row)].value pop = sheet['D' + str(row)].value CountyData.setdefault(state, {}) CountyData[state].setdefault(county, {'tracts': 0, 'pop': 0}) CountyData[state][county]['tracts'] += 1 CountyData[state][county]['pop'] += int(pop) print('Writing the results...') resultFile = open('census2010.py', 'w') resultFile.write('allData = ' + pprint.pformat(CountyData)) resultFile.close() print('Done') 
If I change the keys it will print the result but why does it only have one key? I want to have all the keys in the file so I can look up anything.
Also, Windows is perfectly happy to use `/` for paths.
As /u/mh3f said as of Python 3.4+; also worth noting it's not in Python 2.7
Run Python natively?
Macs need 2.7, which is why it was preinstalled. If you are using 3.5, then keep them both. They do not interfere with each other. Use the command `python` to launch python2 and the `python3` command to launch python3. --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython.

How did you manage to change the colouring of the text..?
Thanks!
I loaded a Mona Lisa image in Photoshop and then clicked Image &gt; Mode &gt; Bitmap to change it to black and white pixels only, then shrunk it down. I forget how I got the strings of "1" and "0" from that (probably using the Pillow module?). But I changed that binary number to hex to make it a bit shorter for the source code.
At a glance it looks like all the CountryData lines should be tabbed so that they are contained inside the for loop. As is, you will loop through all the items in the sheet until you get to the last one (presumably WY), then write that, which is why your data only has one value. If you tab the CountryData lines it will add all of the states.
For completeness, as others have said it's in py3: there is a backport for py2 on PyPI. The problem is that a lot of file-y functions accept Path objects in py3, but in py2 they only accept strings, which can cause problems.
That's definitely why you're getting the error. It honestly sounds like a mistake in the book. Looking at your code above, it looks like the 4 lines starting with "CountryData..." need to be within the for loop. As it is, it loops three each row of the original data, but doesn't get them into the CountyData data structure. 
What's the biggest problem with it?
Thanks for the help, I appreciate it. I’m not sure what you mean though?
windows actually understands / paths, but you just can't type them at the dos prompt I havent looked at the code but if there is a path problem it might be the home directory is in a different place

There are two things you need to do in Sudoku: to solve the puzzle and to interact with a user to get and show a puzzle. Separate those two things out. Write small, easy to understand functions that do one thing at a time.
Good stuff. I'm a novice but if you're interested in any feedback: All of your url's have this is common: https://shop.lego.com/en-IE/ You couild declare a variable called **baseurl** and assign it that value. That would allow you to shorten your other url variables to increase readability. Then you could have your **get** function be **driver.get(baseurl + url)**. I like how explicit your code is. There are a couple of variables that you could maybe tweak. **l = []** and **d = {}** doesn't tell the reader much, other than you're using a list and dictionary for something. Also, your for loop **for x in range(1,200)**, it would be nice to tell at a glance what you're looping over (other than a range). 
[Pyinstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/) is better for me (Linux/Win/Mac)
Depends. I feel it's a dice roll here. Based on my experience, one of a few things can happen: 1. You tell boss. Boss is stoked. Boss rewards you and you get more work. 2. You tell boss. Boss is stoked. You get more work with no reward. 3. You don't tell boss, you get no more work and no reward. I'm generally pessimistic, so I would say 2 is the most likely and, because of that, I would push towards 3.
Back when I did network admin type stuff as my day job, I automated everything I could. I wouldn’t tell the boss unless a: they needed to know (needed the whole team to use it) and b: it was well tested/demo ready. Many of these things were small/annoying things that I just didn’t want to do.. One of the bigger projects was automating the deployment of filters into the network because I got tired of chasing down and fixing mistakes.. In every case, the work was appreciated and was rewarded (either monetary or being granted more freedom). It definitely saved me from being laid off at one job.. It’s not a matter of rendering yourself obsolete, it’s about clearing mindless crap off your plate so you can focus on interesting problems..
Could you post it in a higher resolution? It's pretty blurry.
I took option 3, and updated my resume.
I will answer your points in their respective order. Yes, I do have more cores, unfortunately the code I have is sequential. Optimising will likely not dramatically help, given that the time complexity of the problem is O(n^3) and cannot be made any lower. Yes, I am using NumPy and SciPy, as well as specialised techniques to work with extremely large matrices.
Also, if you have I'd like you to post your stories to /r/boringthingsautomated so that other people can see what kinds of task people use programming to solve.
I added a big Edit to my comment, before writing my first one I just blindly scrolled through the code and changed the lines producing errors, without thinking about it too much, and stopped debugging quickly because I didn't want to spend too much time on it. Turns out there were more where I didn't assume any

Not op but it seems that a dependency is pygment, and I believe they left a note stating that library is how. 
The best way to avoid getting them mixed up in the first place is to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), which manages different versions of Python for you in an isolated environment.
Thanks for this !!!
Is it just me or does that subreddit not exist? Wanted to check it out but saw no posts and the sidebar just gave me an error.
Thanks, will do!
Just FTR it's now [pathlib2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pathlib2/) as pathlib is no longer supported.
Just started learning python a couple of days ago. Really enjoying it and starting to make a 2-choice text base adventure game. Hope I manage to finish!
 Why would you ever use sys.argv? I can’t think of a situation where using sys.argv is preferable over argparse. 
Sure, when it's been put on pypi and has had years of use which show it to be superior to IDLE, all the tests have been put in place, somebody wants to write the PEP...
if you want to be lazy it's quick to access cmd line args through sys.argv. im not familiar with argparse though so maybe ive been missing out on something cool
Looks horrible, I like it.
 I’m pretty damn lazy and I go for argparse as soon as I expect a script to be more than a one off (and sometimes even then). Snipit from the [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) — import argparse parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() parser.add_argument('--foo', help='foo help') args = parser.parse_args() Granted it’s a bit more complex than sys.argv[1] but then you’ve got something super extensible, usage text practically for free, and args that can be short or long (the foo argument above could also be passed with ‘-f’). I suppose the answer to my own question is if the script takes 1 positional argument then argparse is over kill. Anything more than that and the users / maintainers of your script (that includes you) will be thankful for the help / extensibility argparse provides. 
What error do you receive when you try to run it?
I mean, no, not like this. Somebody might look at it, but because you haven't typed it out so someone can just copy paste it? Don't take a photo, post the code and maybe someone will. But there are better subreddits for this. The sidebar makes this note, that /r/learnpython is a better place to ask questions like this. 
Sounds interesting. Would love the link when it's published. 
Thanks. I need a cheat sheet for every time I need to mess with datetime.
Typo in patCh separator
No idea. It closes before I have a chance to read it
Never seen a calculator need the time module before... Paste the code and I'll fix it if you want. 
Thanks for sharing this place! It'll definitely come in handy when I'm looking for a cookbook.
WHAT?!?
#COULD YOU POST IT IN A HIGHER RESOLUTION? IT'S PRETTY BLURRY.
Completely agreed. argparse is great for basic posix style arguments, and especially easy to work with. When you get into more complex nested git-style commands though it falls short quickly, even with subparsers.
Do you have a drop in solution for sub commands?
import time print("Options: ") print("Enter add to add 2 numbers.") print("Enter sub to subtract 2 numbers.") print("Enter mult to multiply 2 numbers.") print("Enter div to divide 2 numbers.") print("Enter no to end the program.") time.sleep(4) user_input = input("Choose: ") if user_input = "no": break elif user_input = "add": x = input("Enter a number: ") y = input("Enter another number: ") result = int(x + y) print("The answer is " + result) elif user_input = "sub": x = input("Enter a number: ") y = input("Enter another number: ") result = int(x - y) print("The answer is " + result) elif user_input = "mult": x = input("Enter a number: ") y = input("Enter another number: ") result = int(x * y) print("The answer is " + result) elif user_input = "div": x = input("Enter a number: ") y = input("Enter another number: ") result = int(x / y) print("The answer is " + result) else: print("Unknown Input!") time.sleep(3) time.sleep(5) break That would be much appreciated, thanks.
Try print("The current value of x is", x) Python won't let you concatenate a string and an int, but the print function will do the conversion automagically for you. --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython.

Maybe so. However, I'd say global is sensible when installing binaries. E.G.: `mackup`, `t`, `sshuttle`, `etc`.

What is this, a cheatsheet for ants? So fucking tiny.
Using or writing another command-line parser is a big use case.
[Plac](http://micheles.github.io/plac/) is an argparse wrapper that was literally designed for use cases like this. I use it on almost all of my projects.
No. It all goes on your resume though. 
*sneakily saves image * I'll keep that for later ^^
Yeah, I was using sys.argv for a while before learning about argparse. My code quality and consistency went up tenfold after the switch. It's one of those things that after you learn about it, you can't help but say to yourself "Damn, I wish I had known about this earlier"
You can also do it the same way you do in C: `print("The current value of x is %s" % x)`
Thanks
 As a plain png: https://ibb.co/hTqQxG 
That subreddit does not exist for me.
=0) sure but then you're probably not in need of a cheet sheet for beginners.
argparse gets convoluted fast
Whoops, boring "stuff", not "things". The link is fixed now.
Beginners? Beginners don't give a fuck about time methods, time formatting and dunders in classes when they have no clue how to make them. sys/os variables are randomly put in there for no reason, anyway, for real cheatsheet, go here: https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python3/ That's what actual python cheatsheet looks like, enjoy.
Nobody should ever need to access most of the things in the section "os Variables" because `os.path` exists. And "Class Special Methods" seems really useless without some sort of explanation. Do I use `__getattr__` or `__getattribute__`? What qualifies `__str__` as a "time method"? What about a list of the most used built-ins? Do `byteorder` and `exitfunc` *really* belong in a *cheat sheet*?!
This is nothing to do with print, its that you're trying to add a string and a non-string
Thanks, I had never heard of plac and I just substituted it for argv and it worked the first try. Love it!
This is pretty good. But the `os` section should probably be replaced with `pathlib` since that's the recommended thing these days. Likewise `argparse` is a more useful reference than `sys.argv`. For Python, I think it's better to teach top-down, i.e. reference the high-level interfaces rather than the low-level details. The datetime stuff seems out of place. `requests` or `numpy` might be more generally useful.
So just to clarify with a metaphor: you are trying to insert a rumblepack into a n64 emulator
this looks neat
Dude... Maybe go back on your meds... Sure, total beginners -- people who have never coded a day in their life -- might be a bit overwhelmed by this, but people coming from another language, or with a smattering of coding experience but not enough to really be proficient in any language could really benefit from this. I know because that was me -- things exactly like this helped me get up to speed quickly. I use date formatting all the time, because most of what I use Python for is to automate the stuff I used to do by hand in Excel, and I use sys path and file variables all the time because so much of what I do is intended to run as an automated task.
Did you check how much CPU and ram it uses on your laptop? What I meant is can you run two or more simulations in parallel on that machine. As far as optimizations go, have you profiled? Cubic time complexity refers to how it scales, not run time at a fixed N. Numba with nopython=True can be really fast! And they just released wheels so it's easy to install. Profiling is a good exercise even if it turns out to be already optimal, which is unlikely.
Got it. Pip wasn't upgrading though I thought it was. Works like a dream now! No LLVM install!
&gt;Maybe go back on your meds. There's no need to trivialize mental illness just to be an asshole.

Is “learn python the hard way” still a good way to learn python?
I wrote a script for automating openssl certificate renewal for my website on www.pythonanywhere.com. Typically to renew the ssl certificate, you have to generate the certificate manually and send the pythonanywhere support staff an email with the details about where your certificates are located in your pythonanywhere directories. The script I wrote does the certificate generation and automatically emails the support staff the information about where my certs are located whenever they expire. The script runs as a task every day to make sure my certs are always up to date. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/asher-scott/pythonanywhere-ssl-renewal) , not sure if this is something that many people are interested in, but its a small script that allows me to maintain SSL on my website without having to worry about certificate expiration.
I've been using python every day for half a decade and I don't think I've *ever* used half the things on this cheat sheet. If I ever do need to know... altsep (???) I will find it on stackoverflow.

That's what I love about it. It's so dead-simple to use, but it works perfectly.
That claim is ridiculous. Mental health issues are underaddressed due to lack of attention and funding, not due to comments on the internet. 
Whenever i put #(Example) thats telling you/ explaining to you what it means just ignore it when using code There are many apps to help guide you on the App Store or Windows Store ect I use 3 to help with Python, C++. I would recommend not repeating code because then that will just make it over 8 pages long for a game like Zork. If you did a while loop when you can or if loop it will help you greatly, but im guessing you dont know what these are so ill explain A if loop is a loop (A thing that goes non stop until something is changed to make it stop) so if you had a variable input at the start saying a=int(input("Write A") Then you wanted to make sure that its either a or b and make actions for either one then you would do this if a= "A": print("Correct") elif a = "C": #(Elif is a statement used to make another rule as in "else if a =c if a doesnt = a.) print("Easter Egg") else: #(Finish loop) print("Incorrect") This means that it will go down the code telling you what is right and if the first if is correct then it will choose that path rather than the others and so on A While loop is very different to a if loop because it is non stop unless something changes i.e a==a While a==a: print("Hello") a=input("Put B") In this code above it finds the Variable named a then it will see if its named a and then if so it will print Hello and then ask a question to the User and if they put A it will do the same code again but if not then it will stop These will help you a lot when writing this code When you posted i was writing at when it said Submitted at 5 minutes but now its 15 :P If you need anymore help just reply :)!
Only crucification? Surely it should be The Comfy Chair :-)
I only said part of the reason, and while you're right that those are serious substantive barriers, "lack of attention" is precisely the point I'm making - it's not taken seriously. Dismissal of mental health is extremely widespread, and it doesn't help when its what we reach for first to insult others.
This looks awesome! Quick tip about your code, its not necessary, but just a little nitpick, I would work on fixing your indentation, as there's 12 spaces instead of the expected 8.
Concatenate means join at the ends. F-strings allow you to embed python expressions into string literals.
Thanks for not being a douchebag and for standing up against unhelpful mental health stigmas.
At my past part time job during the summer, as a data entry person, I automated everything. Didn't tell anyone a thing and noone knew since I worked in my own private cubicle room. While everything was being automated, I just spent the time learning other things, like other coding languages and stuff like that. 
Has anyone made an idiom cheatsheet? I keep seeing people writing python that looks like a machine translation from Java

Learning Processing.py is a bit of a waste of time. Processing is a Java library disguised as a programming language. It has strong, static typing and lots of brackets and a compiler and it's basically just Java. Processing.py is an attempt to copy the Processing library _and all its syntax_ into Python, as much as possible. Which is _mental_, if you ask me. You can't ask someone to code in a Java style (overloaded methods, semicolons) except for sometimes when you have to code in a Python style (significant indentation, no parentheses around code blocks). But Processing is designed to be easy, so either learn Python or learn Processing properly. Don't try and do both. Or, check out [p5.py](https://github.com/p5py/p5) which, taking inspiration from [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), is another implementation of Processing's original goals, designed from the ground up as a Python library, not as a Python port of a Java library. It's in alpha right now, but looks really promising.
Next time /r/learnpython would be better suited for this sort of question! draw_ball() doesn't run first because it's within the function main(), which is called (run) at the bottom of your script.

You’re right. I am a beginner. Your cheat sheet is actually helpful. As someone trying to finish my first courses on Python, you at my level, your cheat sheet is quite a bit more helpful than non-coded examples. I think I can actually use your cheat sheet to speed up my learning. Instead of going, “I need an ifelse statement”, and then seeing that on almost any other cheat sheet as correct thing to do, but then now having to google the correct syntax, with yours i can just keep programming without the added two or three steps. Thanks.
Half this stuff is things I've used once or twice, if ever. The only actual useful part to me is the list slicing, I always forget that.
I feel like you could basically batch replace all "@asyncio.coroutine\ndef" -&gt; "async def", and "yield from" -&gt; "await", then repeatedly try running the code fixing the syntax errors from any yieldfroms you shouldn't have converted into awaits. May be some places that doesnt work but I feel like it would get you most of the way there
Techincally you can use the first line alone, but then to use stuff like `QMainWindow`, `QLabel`, etc you'll need to qualify them with the module name - `QtWidgets.QMainWindow`, which is just annoying. This is not techincally Pythonic, but Qt wasn't really designed with Python in mind, so this is a good enough compromise. 
What gets me most about this is that it doesn't show examples of what they actually do. For example, I'm forever forgetting the correct syntax for join and split, but this "cheat sheet" doesn't explain that - which for a beginner, is kind of crucial. 
I was a beginner 6 months ago and I made almost exclusively web apps and commonly used time methods as well as date formatting because I’m constantly getting dates in different date time types depending what database I pull from.
How has no one mentioned that it says "Cheet" sheet in the title? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.
&gt; dunders in classes lol wut? (Am noob. "dunders"?)
While I agree that OP's cheat sheet would go a bit over the head of absolute beginners, I think it can still be useful (especially to myself). That doesn't make it "not a cheat sheet". To be completely fair, yours is more of a fast-paced tutorial than a cheat sheet. Both are great resources, don't have to try to dump on OP to contribute to the learning. Regardless, thanks for the resource.
Agree on requests 100%, although I think it's hard to make a general cheat sheet for python when people use it in so many different ways.
You’re 100% right and I expected the top comment to be some angry “no, this is bullshit!! Mine’s so much better!” This sub is so pretentious
#You mean like this?
I don't know about that one, but I learned with Automate the Boring Stuff. If you already know how to code in another language though, this will be super boring since it's aimed at total beginners.

Well, there are a few. The main points are that there is a lot of redundancy, a lot of unnecessary code, non-idiomatic and non-conventional practices, and REALLY inefficient processes. You need functions, algorithms, and data structures. I will try to go down the script in order of what I see. I am not going to optimize this though. I just want to focus on the code quality without breaking what your script does. I'm not going to run it to test it. [Here](https://pastebin.com/iN24PgZ1) is your script with the modifications I mention below. Down from 204 lines to about 40 lines of relevant code. There will also be a text file with your URLs. On to the code. You have a lot of unused and redundant imports. `os` is not used, and you import selenium, then import specific parts of selenium. `from selenium import webdriver` is the only one you need. Both requests and selenium request the webpage from the server. Anything you can do in requests can be done in Selenium. HTTP requests are slow and duplicating that is not a good idea. What is worse, your script is requesting each URL with Selenium TWICE (line 78 and line 185) and once with requests (line 80), but only using once response from Selenium. That is a lot of wasted overhead. Every `click()` call also potentially requests data from the server. I didn't run this script or look at the webpage, so I don't know if it does. There are multiple ways that you can handle the URLs better. You don't need to assign them to variables and then put the variables into a list. You can put them all into one multi-line string and split it, you can put them in a file, you can put them directly into a list, you can do any of the above with the base url and concatenate or string format the path. Using a separate file (best option IMO): with open("urls.txt", "r") as f: urls = [url for url in f.readlines() if url.strip()] I put one blank line between each url, so I just make sure it skips the blank lines using `if url.strip()`. Or you can hard-code them into a list: base_url = "http://www.some_site.com/" paths = [ "path_for_this", "path_for_that" ] urls = [base_url + path for path in paths] You shouldn't put blank lines between each line of code. You don't need all these `time.sleep()` lines, the `print()` calls, or the comments. Comments should answer the question `Why` not `What` or `How`. The code answers `What` and `How`. You should only put `sleep()` calls when you need them to wait for the page to load or something else. If you are using them for that, don't. Selenium has built-in tools for waiting for things to appear and for the page to load. This takes 16 minutes per page and is completely unnecessary. This is also not the only place you use `sleep` in each of the 200 iterations of your loop FOR EVERY URL: for x in range(1, 200): time.sleep(5) How many days does it take for this script to run? You can probably do it faster manually. You shouldn't use single-letter variables except in idiomatic places like loops, comprehensions, etc. where they make sense. `l = []` and `d = {}` will not make sense to you when you come back to this code in 3 months. Always code and comment for your future self and for others to read. variable names should also be lower snake_case. You are abusing `try/except`. You should only handle specific exceptions that you reasonably expect to occur. All errors need to be seen or handled specifically. You should be using `if` instead of `try/except`. title_path = '//*[@id="maincontent"]/div/div/div[1]/div/div[2]/div[1]/h1' title_element = driver.find_element_by_xpath(title_path) if title_element: title_text = title_element.text.lstrip("b'") else: title_text = " " d["Title"] = title_text This code is then repeated a lot, so make it into a function. The only thing that is changing is the xpath. def get_path(xpath): element = driver.find_element_by_xpath(xpath) if element: return element.text.lstrip("b'") else: return " " You can then call it like this: title_path = '//*[@id="maincontent"]/div/div/div[1]/div/div[2]/div[1]/h1' d["Title"] = get_path(title_path) product_path = '//*[@id="maincontent"]/div/div/div[2]/div/p' d["Product Details"] = get_path(product_path ) We can make this even better using a `dict` to store our paths and the name of each path: paths = { "title": '//*[@id="maincontent"]/div/div/div[1]/div/div[2]/div[1]/h1', "product": '//*[@id="maincontent"]/div/div/div[2]/div/p' } for name, path in paths.items(): d[name] = get_path(path) We can use better names and a dictionary comprehension to make this more concise: data = {name: get_path(driver, path) for name, path in paths.items()} I believe your output CSV files are snowballing. I have removed a lot of code here to show this: l = [] for x in range(1, 200): d = {} # Add stuff to d l.append(d) df = pandas.DataFrame(l) InputFile = "Results/Results_" + str(i) + ".csv" df.to_csv(InputFile) You are adding data to the list each iteration of your loop and writing the current list to the CSV. I don't use Pandas, so I am not sure if it is rewriting the file each time or if it is appending data to it. The [docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.to_csv.html) say `write` a lot, so I will presume you are writing progressively larger files that include the previous data from each iteration. There is a lot more you can do to improve it, but that is a good start for you. This will still output progressively larger files, and I am not sure the page navigation will work. You click on elements in line 96 of your script and never return to the previous page. I recommend looking into databases. [SQLite](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) is easy to use, is a Python built-in, and makes working with data MUCH easier. Hope this helps. 
Do you have any examples of what you're talking about? I can't think of anything that matches what you're describing, but it's possible it's something I'm just so used to that I don't even notice it. 
Nice, thank you.
Thanks!
&gt;You don't tell boss, you get no more work and no reward. The reward is not having to do trivial shit that can be automated.
dunder = **d**ouble **under**score. It's shorthand to refer to methods in a class named like \_\_foo\_\_ that have a special use in Python. For example, all classes have a \_\_str\_\_ method to turn the object into a printable string.
This is definitely the best rundown of a language I've read. Is there one for Java?
There is nothing in OP's cheatsheet that is useful to a beginner, with the exception of slicing. And maybe one or two of the file IO functions.
There's one for nearly every popular language! (With varying quality.) Check the site. ;)
. 
after a long time practicing python on and off, I finally feel like I know enough to begin learning django. 
That's a great point you have there. I literally had never thought about the matter that way before.
Agreed, that's the cheat sheet I used. A picture may be worth a thousand words but a code usage example is worth hours of frustration.

By lack of attention I mean a lack of human time. Fifteen minutes of volunteering would do more good than an entire lifetime of avoiding jabs at mental illness in internet insults.
Why not both? Being a considerate person isn't a zero-sum game.
This is an awesome post.Really very informative and creative contents. These concept is a good way to enhance the knowledge.I like it and help me to development very well.Thank you for this brief explanation and very nice information.Well, got a good knowledge. https://www.besanttechnologies.com/training-courses/python-training-institute-in-bangalore 
Because you are trying to police language which causes a near zero amount of harm, it may even do good. The stigma of mental illness might be even more harmful than the trivialization of it and if you cant joke about it you won't break the stigma.
Until you can find a source for your claim that being able to make fun of mental illness is somehow better at giving it the attention and funding you yourself mentioned are the real problems, I'll err on the side of not being an asshole at others' expense, thanks. Considering we've been making fun of it all along and look where we are...i'm not holding my breath for your source.
&gt; # Convention is to use four spaces, not tabs. I stopped reading here. Jk, really nice, good cheatsheet!
First off, I never said it was better than attention and funding, I said it MIGHT be better than trying to police language on the internet. And where is your source that poking fun at something makes it worse? I say it might do harm, it might do good. The science isn't conclusive. What is conclusive is putting time and money at a problem to make it better. II don't see much value in internet virtue signaling. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4059196/ A tangentally related study.
Please ask for help in /r/learnpython, not in here. Did you mean to indent the three lines of code after `draw_ball()` so that they are all inside the main function that you call at the bottom? Because right now they're not. You define a main function which contains *only* the call to draw_ball. You ask the question, get the answer and print it, all in the main body of your program, and then afterwards you call the main function, which calls draw_ball.
That study is specific to self-disclosure humor, which means the one making the joke is cracking wise about their own experiences. The study even says that removing that element of the humor (that the comic is discussing their own experience) removes any anti-stigma benefit it brings: &gt; ...stripping out disclosures will translate the piece to humor alone, which we think will undermine any benefits. Authenticity of the comic, operationalized as perceiving a comic as knowing about what he speaks because of his lived experience, will likely be an important moderator in anti-stigma effects. So your own source would argue that the instance used above that I initially called out, "get back on your meds", is not a productive use of humor to combat the stigma of mental illness. You seem to like to rail against policing language but it's really just asking you not to be an asshole - why is that such a difficult request for you to accommodate?
Begiin your pardon?
Right, it gives evidence of humor stigmatizing mental illness. Not the other bit. "which we think will undermine any benefits." isn't exactly evidence though. &gt;You seem to like to rail against policing language but it's really just asking you not to be an asshole You are just renaming what I consider it to what you consider it and telling me it should be an easy request. You dismiss my point of view entirely. "You seem to rail against abortion but it's really just asking you to support a woman's right to choose - why is that such a difficult request for you to accommodate?" See why that is stupid? &gt; why is that such a difficult request for you to accommodate? Because everyone has a different definition of what makes you an asshole. You speak from your own perspective as if its the most obvious thing in the world what is and isn't over the line but that isn't the same for everyone. I've seen people claim so many insult words to be offensive to someone, retarded, stupid, moron, idiot, slow, brain damaged, ugly, etc. The list goes on. You could probably find people who consider you an asshole for some of the words you use if you look deep enough. Telling people where YOUR line is won't move that line for everyone.
&gt; Because everyone has a different definition of what makes you an asshole. That's literally why we should err on the side of caution, lol. Everyone having different standards doesn't mean we should say "fuck standards, everyone who doesn't like what I have to say can suck it up". It means understanding how our language can unintentionally make us sound like a dick to others, when we didn't mean to, and avoiding it. &gt; You speak from your own perspective as if its the most obvious thing in the world Lol you're sure trying to make this personal. My reasoning wasn't personal, but from the perspective of someone who lives considerately of those around them and how my words and actions affect them. It's called living mindfully, try it sometime.
Does anyone actually still argue about it? The fact that tab width depends on user settings (some python developers deliberately set it to 8 spaces to check whether tabs were used), and even worse when their text editor converts those tabs into 8 spaces and now you have to go through the entire file of code to get it back how it was...
`__dunder_method__`
"We have numbers" "2 + 2" Yeah I am sorry that it's too hard for you timmy, let's learn the alphabet! 
Actually, all "cheatsheets" are horrible, the only good cheatsheet for X language is it's own specification and documentation. Especially when python's documentation contains syntax and explanation on how to use it :)
Java? Pfft. Why just java? All of them! https://learnxinyminutes.com/
That's my point basically, especially when there's more than one time library in python and there's also things like timezone aware objects, unaware objects, different conversions, date format itself can be modified to whatever you want and all of those are in documentation and way easier to read, also it provides some examples... Also IO, lol... It doesn't even have `open()` function included, so useful. Also nobody even uses plain open anymore, but `with` instead, which is also provided in resource I linked, or well, even in python's documentation itself... &gt;["It is good practice to use the with keyword when dealing with file objects. The advantage is that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised at some point. Using with is also much shorter than writing equivalent try-finally blocks: ..."'(https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html)
Well you can convert time object to time string using `__str__`, duh, it's not like every object has one!
How about check the one I linked? I also have even better one than both original and the one I posted in my first comment: https://docs.python.org/3/ Have fun :)
Do you even know what internet is? Do you realize that you pretty much use it all the time? The only time you really aren't using it is when you're sleeping nowadays. Also it connects entire world, and you know, if everyone makes a joke out of it, it eventually becomes a joke... Just because it's in text and wasn't said like, to your face, doesn't mean it's any less wrong. I mean, you probably also think that death threat personally face to face is a horrible thing and one sent over internet is a joke, so I can't blame you really...
I don’t understand the question. And considering no one has answered yet that seems common. Try to describe the problem you’re having maybe?
Look up string formatting. 
I'm not interested in avoiding it because I see not value in it. &gt;Lol you're sure trying to make this personal. That statement wasn't intended as a jab at you. I was just describing what you are doing. Not what you are.
You are focusing way too much on the internet bit. Let me reword it for you. "That claim is ridiculous. Mental health issues are underaddressed due to lack of attention and funding, not due to comments people make." &gt;I mean, you probably also think that death threat personally face to face is a horrible thing and one sent over internet is a joke, so I can't blame you really... I don't distinguish between internet communication and other communication at all. You made that narrative up all on your own.
When I was working as network engineer I automate a lot of repetitive stuff: create VLAN, create ACL, create template for routing profiles, etc. My boss didn't never know because we was forbidden to create our own tools if he didn't approve them in advance. 
So, the problem is that nobody urges people to think about it seriously, and not people who don't take seriously? Got it. I don't know what this sheep mentality is but I don't need a herder to tell me what is a serious issue and what isn't.
Simple string based table drawing module. I'm currently trying to improve my unit testing skills, I used this project as an exercise. It's actually a bit over-tested. [https://github.com/pedrudehuere/py_draw_table](https://github.com/pedrudehuere/py_draw_table) 
Wait, how do you work with lists without slicing? I use it all the time.
&gt;think about it seriously, Not think about it serious, but put actual effort into improving it. Soapboxing a guy/girl who says "forget your meds" does NOTHING for mental health. It just makes that person feel good and virtuous. Virtue signaling. America is as far as I know the last first world country without socialized medicine where medical causes need funding and serious action to get support. I figured it was obvious that is what I was referring to. Are you saying first world countries excluding the USA have such a great grip on mental health issues via adequate funding and human resources that the lowest hanging fruit has become strangers using words you don't like? Is that your claim? &gt;I don't know what this sheep mentality is but I don't need a herder to tell me what is a serious issue and what isn't. I don't know what this is referring to. If you pulled it out of thin air to make a point, I'll be the first to admit I probably have the unpopular opinion, the exact opposite of sheep mentality.
Me too
Then explain "you're fucking retarded" nowadays meaning that someone is just fucking dumb, not that they actually have a mental illness. Go figure why it's a thing, probably because it wasn't funded amirite :)

I don't know what point you are trying to make. Can you pay money to make people use the words you want? No. Was that your point? Do you think mentally disabled would prefer more time and money from people to help them live and prosper or for people to stop using retarded as a synonym for dumb?
IMO avoid Django if you're still a beginner and if it can be avoided. You can write leaner, more Pythonic apps with Flask or Bottle, and then bringing in libraries that you need as you go. Read: https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2012/12/11/learning-python-via-django-considered-harmful/
Nah, what I meant is I can never remember if [n:] slices the first n things or the last n things or removes the first n things and gives you everything remaining etc. Done it hundreds of times, still do [1,2,3,4][2:] in a shell to check. 
And who are those people who don't get enough time or money from other people?
Oh right. I forget that stuff as well, good thing it's so easy to check.
Who are the people who say "I have plenty of support from others and money, if only people didn't use the word "retard" my terrible life would become perfect"?

zero amount of harm? You must be pretty ignorant of what it's like bringing up the fact you have a mental illness, and take medication for it, to the people around you. The basis for this insult is that the opinions of people with mental health problems are worth less and should be ignored. This kind of thinking is common in people with problems, and is exactly the kind of thing that stops them opening up about their issues. I doubt the original poster had this intention, it's just a phrase that came to mind when they were trying to invalidate what the person before them had said. That's why the response to them was useful.

It's possible that the exported .csv file is not formatted correctly from excel. As you can export a csv file for MAC or MS-DOW(windows). Are you able to open it with import CSV? This way you can determine if its a problem with your code or the file. Can you post a sample code so smarter people than me can see if there are any possible syntax issues going on? I would also suggest pathing directly to the file and see if it can be read that way. And depending on the scope of the project I wouldnt want to leave that file in with all my python scripts. I usually export/import that stuff from other locations, not sure if thats standard practice or whatever but its something I do for organization and data protection purposes.
Might be quite resource intensive to do that quickly, depending on what you're doing it may be better to read the web page's DOM and scan for CSS of a specific hex colour then have your program "click" it

CPython is the reference implementation (ie the officially supported) of the Python language, written in C. There exist other implementations for different purposes, eg Jython (targeting Java Virtual Machine), IronPython (targeting .NET CLR), or MicroPython (targeting micro controllers and embedded systems). Implementations vary in the number of supported language standards and in (3rd party) library support. 
Good. I tried a couple weeks ago to start up a django web server and I literally wanted to throw my computer out the window it was so frustrating. But I'll probably come back to it in another week or two as I need to get some apps up and running on it.
Where is it located? Where is python's working directory? That would be my suggestion to look at first.
I've used python to make a few different things and I've never encountered an explanation of what 'foo' and 'bar' mean I just treat it like 'n' or 'm' in math
Why is the official repo named that?
This is awesome, thanks for sharing. 
My side projects are generally all over the place, organized but all over the place;(VM's, Desktop and server locations can be difficult to keep track of). And because I am working on multiple different projects at once I tend to lose track of where stuff is at exactly. Thankfully, I have started to use some source/version control processes for this exact issue which has helped to create less chaos and has forced me to remain more organized which is good for everyone involved. I will say the one downside to using a public repo on github is that you have to remove any sensitive data which can make more and more files to manage. But I think the end result is a much more organized because as long as you have the latest version on Git you are ok to get lost in all the code. You can always come back to your repo and start over. :) I have no idea about professional environments as most coding I do is for my own personal stuff or automation projects for work which are not very large in scope and do not require more collaborators to work on them. Hopefully someday I'll get to experience this. Hope this helps.
What happens if you mix them, I don't develop much on Windows so have never tried.

I would recommend Numpy for this problem: import numpy as np grid = np.array([[3, 8, 2, 6, 7, 1, 4, 9, 5], [5, 6, 7, 9, 4, 8, 2, 3, 1], [1, 9, 4, 2, 3, 5, 7, 6, 8], [7, 2, 8, 5, 6, 4, 9, 1, 3], [6, 1, 3, 7, 2, 9, 5, 8, 4], [9, 4, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6, 2, 7], [4, 7, 1, 8, 9, 6, 3, 5, 2], [8, 3, 6, 4, 5, 2, 1, 7, 9], [2, 5, 9, 3, 1, 7, 8, 4, 6]]) Now it is easy to get lines, columns, or subarrays: first_line = grid[0] last_column = grid[:, -1] third_subarr = grid[0:3, 6:] # select lines zero to two, and # columns 6 to 8

It's funny, for a controlled assesment for Computer Science that would take 30 hours across multiple weeks of lessons. The thing was, they let us take in notes. There were no rules, apart from they had to be physical. So we all just took in "cheat sheets" printed off from the internet. I had about 50 pages of internet resources that they let me take into the assessment.
I'd like to import numpy once in my application and use it in every .py file. Not explicitly import everywhere I need it (I know explicit is better than implicit, but I want to do it explicit one time and no more than that).

Well that’s not how Python works. But is it really such a hassle to write “from numpy import *” in a few files? If you do write it a lot then add a text snippet/template to your IDE so you can do “num” and hit tab and it writes the full thing. 
Give the absolute path and check the spelling of everything. 
&gt; Beginners don't give a fuck about time methods, time formatting and dunders Everybody will have it their way. Why do you want to decide for everyone?
Holy shit yes. I was like "nobody actually uses stupid 'cheat sheets' like this" but the thing you linked, shit, I use Python once every six months and that sheet is the actual stuff I forget after working with other languages.

Is your question about how to use Python or about the format itself? It may be simpler to convert to CSV, then use something like the sites below. https://json-csv.com/ http://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-geojson.htm
My question is regarding how to do the exact same thing using python code.. without converting the data to csv but directly into GeoJSON. The program will take json as an input file and then produces GeoJSON as output.

As a begineer, I greatly appreciate your post. I was definitely wondering what the heck the OPs post was about--none of that seemed beginner friendly to me.
Try /r/learnpython for fast help next time. Also for reddit formating purposes put a tab before every line of code. Anyway one way to fix this is to use a for loop to print that. for i in range(rows): print(sudokusolution[i]) Anyway a tip is that thats not a very elegant way to do Sudoku. You should instead concider making a Sudoku class which has its __str__ method overloaded. Then you can store the solution as a private (well this is python so ~sorta private) sudoku object inside the sudoku object and then make a print solution method which calls print on the solution. 
There is a python geojson library: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/geojson You need to parse original json file use system json library: import json import sys import geojson data = json.load(sys.stdin) Then you need to walk through all projects and locations: projecs = [] for project_name, project_data in data['projects'].items(): locations = [] for location in project_data['locations']: locations.append((location['latitude'], location['longitude])) Create geo objects like MultiPoint: projects.append(geojson.MultiPoint(locations) And return a result like GeometryCollection: result = geojson.GeometryCollection(projects) geojson.dump(sys.stdout, result) 
&gt; It’s not a matter of rendering yourself obsolete, it’s about clearing mindless crap off your plate so you can focus on interesting problems.. This!! The code will mostly need updating at various intervals with organisational changes etc but yes this 1000 x this. 
Thank you so much..!
Happy cake day, by the way! :)
My (basic) follow-up question to this is, where can I see the working directory? 
Thanks for this - it worked. I was hoping to avoid doing this, though. I know in the past, I was able to simply write the name of the file and it would work. Not sure why it's not working now.
I double-checked - the file opens just fine if I open it in Excel. I used the full path to the file and that worked in spyder, so thank you for the suggestion. I was hoping to avoid using such a long name, though. Here is the original code that I wrote: import pandas as pd from pandas import Series, DataFrame titanic_df = pd.read_csv('train.csv') Any suggestions?

No snakes here. Only bugs.
Thank you :)
It’s extremely well documented, and even though it sometimes feels like you’re trying to fit a square peg in a round hole all you need is a little practice and patience!
looks horrible, why wouldn't you just use cython?
Honestly now in days everything is web based (If it’s feasible for your use) I would use an HTML table. You can use JSON data to populate the webpage.
Throw "python solar system simulation" into a search engine and any of the going on 1,000,000 hits should give you something to work with.
Try Pycharm, it might have a somewhat steep learning curve but at the end of the day it’s my favorite IDE
That’s awesome, github link? 
`Ctrl + F: sys` no results. I'm disappointed tbh
Yea I ended up with a couple of sed commands. Indentation was a bit tricky. Thanks
You could try import os os.getcwd() In iPython to see what the current working directory is in spyder. 
Yea sure it can! You only need to add the endpoints of your choice and generate the relevant api key. Btw, it currently displays Tech news(e.g. hackernews, tnw etc) and if you wish you can add stock exchange related news too.
This would be much better if it was in a Jupyter Notebook with a Table of Content. Example: http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pybokeh/ipython_notebooks/blob/master/pandas/PandasCheatSheet.ipynb
Web Scrappers. They teach you a lot about: async, ingesting data, cleaning data, web liraries, classes - functions - overall OOP, optimization * effiiciency. Most importantly they teach you to reverse engineer someone else's code and see how you can make yours work based on theirs. Very, very important.
Uh... so this is literally all I have right now: import cv2 import numpy image = cv2.imread('Jude.jpg') gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) edges = cv2.Canny(gray, 50, 150, apertureSize=3) lines = cv2.HoughLines(edges, 1, numpy.pi / 180, 300) cartesian_lines = [] for line in lines: for rho, theta in line: a = numpy.cos(theta) b = numpy.sin(theta) x0 = a * rho y0 = b * rho x1 = int(x0 + 1000*(-b)) y1 = int(y0 + 1000 * a) x2 = int(x0 - 1000 * -b) y2 = int(y0 - 1000 * a) cv2.line(image, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (0, 0, 255), 0) cv2.imwrite('found.png', image) And I'm trying to work out why it's splitting each line in half... &lt;.&lt; I mean.. it's easy enough to fix it afterward, but I'm annoyed that I'd have to.

Python is written in C?
Ever heard of language specification/documentation?
As I mentioned it in other post, language documentation is best cheat sheet to ever exist.
Brython is a Python interpreter written in JavaScript. It translates Python on the fly at page load time. Transcrypt is a compiler, that translates Python in advance. A detailed, practical comparison can be found at: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30155551/python-in-browser-how-to-choose-between-brython-pypy-js-skulpt-and-transcrypt#answer-38564424 A description of Transcrypt itself and the ideas behind it can be found at: https://www.infoq.com/articles/transcrypt-python-javascript-compiler

I just can't understand what prevents you from understanding that all I've really done was state my opinion about OP's post and linked noobs to something that will actually be useful to them.
Gotcha, and honestly that's one of the more common conversions, but the other day I was playing with MD/RST and saw some use cases for going from one to the other. Just figured I'd mention it.
The runtime is written in C. Something has to parse Python code into an AST and turn it into machine code.

*Speaking in generalities, of course* Really depends on your company and I suppose your boss. Any "boss" worth their salt should appreciate an employee not only recognizing an opportunity for efficiency gain, but having the initiative AND skillset to automate it successfully. Chances are that if you find automatable (syntactic genesis!!) tasks in your job they exist in other (probably many other) jobs in your company as well. Maybe your skills would be more beneficial to the company in a role finding and executing on these opportunities? So, my advice would be automate away, and proudly show your work off once it's actually providing value. If you get the cold shoulder from up above, you at least have more information and can make an informed decision from there. But, in general, an organization not willing and/or capable of embracing efficiency gains from technology is not a place I'd want to have my wagon hitched to in the long run anyway. :) Good luck to you!!

I work as sysadmin and we need to update 150+ (other offices had 400+) ubuntu laptops every two summers, sometimes every summer if the system degrades a lot. There are a single sysadmin in each office and a lot of offices so we tried a lot of different options (server cloning, broadcast cloning, massive updates with repository mirroring, clonezilla, rsync, back-hard-dy, etc...). There are a free method politics. If the work is done, they don't care about how you do it. When you finish, you go on holidays. If you don't finish, the work is waiting for you with an army of angry co-workers asking for it. The fastest method I found was a bag of automated usb pendrives. Some office make a master laptop and upload a clonezilla image to the servers. We put it in an personalized automated usb pendrive (No asking, automated backup of personalized files, etc...). And duplicate the pendrive to get 20 of them. When every is done I insert a pendrive and power on the laptop. No asking, so go for the next immediately. Repeat 150 times. With 20 pendrives, I can do 20 laptops in 12-13 minutes. I turned a week or two of work in a 90-120 minutes one. A morning at most in the bigger offices.

You assume because it wouldn’t have been useful to you, it won’t be useful to anyone. You also assume your definition of a cheatsheet is everyone’s definition of a cheatsheet. Why not just provide your beginner tutorial (oh, I’m sorry, “cheetsheet”) as an additional resource to exist alongside OP’s and just leave it at that? It’s not a zero-sum thing where one one can be correct and helpful.

Newbies will take anything you throw at them and will also get hurt by everything negative you tell them. What's your point?
How many languages you know is irrelevant. The title is clear and simple: **Python** cheatsheet **for beginners**, implies that it's about python and suitable to beginners. This image has literally nothing to do with python, the only actually useful part is date/time formatting and even that is useless as anyone who is trying already found it in pythons documentation.

Just FYI, that repo is no longer maintained, it has been migrated to [http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pybokeh/jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/pandas/PandasCheatSheet.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pybokeh/jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/pandas/PandasCheatSheet.ipynb)
For future reference, it's a bad idea to have something in your code that you have no idea about. You can do a search for 'double star Python'. In this case, searching for "kwargs" would have worked as well, since it's a common name for that parameter. In other cases, you can search for syntax using [SymbolHound](http://symbolhound.com/). Python allows keyword arguments, where you pass some arguments by name instead of order. Having a `**kwargs` parameter allows you to take arbitrary keyword arguments, instead of specifying each one. It's usually used when you plan to forward them to another function and don't need to know exactly which names to specify.

No. Now it isn't a problem. But I don't understand why I can not use 0 year and a year more than 9999. 
This is what I hoped to learn. Thank you!
Ugh, I always hate it when I see stuff like that, especially when it's a small loop that could be a trivial list comprehension. Though I will admit that I've been known to abuse list comprehensions in the other way too from time to time. There was one time where I wrote a single line that had two list comprehensions and a dictionary comprehension nested together. IIRC it did something like taking a big list of elements, turning it into a dict to count the occurrences of each value and then sorting by the number of occurrences and printing out totals. List comprehensions are so amazingly handy, I can't imagine why some people ignore them when they could be trivially used. 
There are a few major problems in your code as shown. * `flow =`: It's a syntax error not to have anything on the right-hand side. Your code won't be accepted by the interpreter as-is. * ...list(**kwargs).execute`: I can't tell if this is right without knowing what the object returned by `.channels()` is. * `tasks`: What do you think `tasks` is? What type of object? What does it contain? Write some comments around that part to show what you think the code does.
Cheat sheets are crib notes to remind you of syntax and should fit on... a *sheet*. They're not full examples. For example: Pandas Cheatsheet: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/doc/cheatsheet/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf

Sweet! I'll look into this a little further and see what else I can come up with. Thanks for the post!
&gt; why I can not use 0 year Because it does not exist in the calendar used by `datetime`. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_zero
**Year zero** Year zero does not exist in the Anno Domini system usually used to number years in the Gregorian calendar and in its predecessor, the Julian calendar. In this system, the year 1 BC is followed by AD 1. However, there is a year zero in astronomical year numbering (where it coincides with the Julian year 1 BC) and in ISO 8601:2004 (where it coincides with the Gregorian year 1 BC) as well as in all Buddhist and Hindu calendars. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

You think so? I don't really see a problem with it.
yes. no.
Homework huh...
I noticed.. you converted lat and long to float.
You should avoid star importing something like numpy, which defines over 600 things in its global namespace. The convention is overwhelmingly to do `import numpy as np`, too.
Your problem is not only CPU but also memory bound. 800MB won't fit into CPU caches. The overhead may be caused by multiple CPUs competing for the same shared memory bus.
Yes. No.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem
**Subset sum problem** In computer science, the subset sum problem is an important problem in complexity theory and cryptography. The problem is this: given a set (or multiset) of integers, is there a non-empty subset whose sum is zero? For example, given the set {−7, −3, −2, 5, 8}, the answer is yes because the subset {−3, −2, 5} sums to zero. The problem is NP-complete, meaning roughly that while it is easy to confirm whether a proposed solution is valid, it may inherently be prohibitively difficult to determine in the first place whether any solution exists. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Great stuff
Hi, I forked it. This is a work in progress, fixing the easily fixed: https://gist.github.com/jhadjar/beabe893a86459d03768c33c507e187b 
You can tighten up that first chunk using a hashmap of handler classes.
All makes sense. Honestly, I did not even realize that when I was pulling JSON tags from that message it's just a dictionary - that definitely simplifies the "Key not found" concept. The handler map is cool too. In the .NET world I come from I'd use an interface, but Python is even more flexible there so that's a nice lesson learned. Thank you!!
&gt; DRY: why are you passing json_msg2 to the Handler constructor and as an argument to the constructed object’s method? Ugh, yeah - gross. Artifact of refactoring. Used to be all these various handlers were part of one big "process_message" function. When I decided to split it apart, I inadvertently duplicated that bit.
Thanks for the reply. I never considered the CPU cache. I'll see if I can monitor CPU cache misses to verify this is the culprit.
That's really very useful, thank you! 
Check again ([here's the diff](https://gist.github.com/jhadjar/beabe893a86459d03768c33c507e187b/revisions?diff=split)):
Thanks again. I will read through the links you posted, but the changes I see all make sense. I need to go through everything in more detail though. I had read in several places (on StackOverflow) that Python code should not need any comments. I noticed you added them back which is more what I'm used to so that's nice to see.
Nice idea, I like it! Just few suggestions: 1. I would set the `output` argument to something default, because at the first glance it's not that obvious what's the intention of that argument (I was looking through code to find out). 2. You're not closing file object after opening it. Do it by using `with` [context manager](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2016/03/07/python-with-context-managers/). 3. Setup linter like [flake8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8) or [pylint](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylint/1.8.1) and run it against your code. This will help to identify potential issues. 4. Unittests ;)
Very interested in this topic. Thanks!
You're welcome. &gt; I had read in several places (on StackOverflow) that Python code should not need any comments I wonder if people who say this kind of things actually write, or more pertinent, read code for a living. The comments are addressed to you to explain what I changed and why (the rationale behind my decisions, i.e: keyword arguments vs positional arguments, etc.). They're not really to put into code (although I do write them in commit messages at work, so that others might benefit and I may remember without cluttering the code).

These feeds can, for example, allow a user to keep track of many different websites in a single news aggregator. The news aggregator will automatically check the RSS feed for new content, allowing the content to be automatically passed from website to website or from website to user.

I considered it. However, I am utter garbage at front-end/design stuff. Having a pre-built framework to start with so I can just customize it a bit instead of designing everything from scratch would make my life a whole lot easier.
&gt; I wonder if people who say this kind of things actually write, or more pertinent, read code for a living. I wondered the same. Thanks again, I will rewrite that library with your recommendations and then see if I can apply them to some other ones. Cheers and Happy New Year!
It most certainly is. CPU caches are about 2-4MB per core, not 800MB. In your last measurement (10 processes, 800MB, 2253ms) you are moving bits between memory and CPU at about 6.7GB/s on average. This is quite fast, even on modern CPUs, given that you are probably reading more than that (cache misses when re-reading data out reading of sequence) and are doing some work in between while the memory bus is idle. Not much room to optimize.
Then go bootstrap, can't miss.
Hello, it's probably the User-Agent header. Have a look at https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API (Rules section). &gt; Many default User-Agents (like "Python/urllib" or "Java") are drastically limited to encourage unique and descriptive user-agent strings. My guess is that when you run your script in the command prompt, the User-Agent says 'Python/urllib' and you're limited, but when you run it in PyCharm, it may be changed and you're not so limited. To be sure, follow the recommendations and set the "User-Agent" header to something meaningful.
Geez, that's some terrible way of asserting gcd != 1. Take a look at Euclids algorithm. 
Because .0000001 is not 1e-6, but 1e-7
&gt;Could it be that the script is running faster in command prompt, resulting in less time between requests? No, PyCharm same as command prompt just start python interpreter. Can it be that you run in command prompt without stopping in PyCharm?
Anything other explicit imports might make your code less readable, portable, or sharable on a forum like reddit. Don't do it!
oh true
But if each core has its own cache(12mb on my machine), and also it's own copy of the 800mb data in RAM, why would one cores activity slow down a different core? If it because all the cores share a common bus to RAM, and this bus gets saturated? Thanks for bottle btw
I’ll give it a try once I’ve completed this course. I unfortunately haven’t been unable to actually complete a course due to laziness and lack of motivation, so I’ll see how it goes.
Related to #2, there's an easier way to load json than creating a string from a file, json.load() can open a file descriptor. with open(os.path.join(abspath, "data.json")) as f: data = json.load(f)["data"] Python opens in read-only mode by default, and json is always UTF-8, so there's no need to specify.
The rules differ in that: - I'm much more open to making large changes on my open source project. Companies are cheap. Just make a half-hearted attempt at backwards compatibility/deprecation. - There is actually testing, so don't break things unless you plan on fixing it really soon/it was an accident. - You actually gotta follow PEP-8-ish - You gotta document your code using numpydoc - You gotta make tests; not everything, just enough. - The priority level is 1: bugs, 2: new features that I care about/you can convince me to care about; 3: features you want vs. whatever the current project needs yesterday - Be nice/courteous or I'll ignore you. The nicer and more work you put into your bug report/thought in the feature, the more I'll listen.
Yes, exactly. All cores share the same memory bus and they have to read the 800MB at least once, each. Oh, and the the 12MB cache are per CPU, not per core (for affordable Intel CPUs at least). The per-core cache is usually way smaller. And even if all your data would fit into the cache, modern CPUs would still show better single-core performance than multi-core because they can overclock a single busy core as long as the others are idle.
Do you normally create feature branches in your own projects?
Makes perfect sense, thanks
For a class in college I had to make a chat bot using a dialect of lisp ( functional programming language) if you want to look into chatbots that might be the way. If you’re interested I could pm you the code. 
I made a rudimentary stock prediction algorithm in java using the Encog libraries that was able to forecast certain stocks in the short term. I’d love to hear more about your algorithm and it’s effectiveness. Also what libraries are you using? 
Yeah I disabled the email part cause I have limited users and users are going to be added by the admin. 
Look into chain (from itertools)
... You configure your editor to insert 4 spaces when you hit tab.
Of course not, every editor will insert spaces when you press Tab when configured to use spaces.
Pycharm deals with it for me
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#tabs-or-spaces
Atom, Sublime and VS Code do it too. There might be several reasons to use PyCharm, but this isn't one of them.
Not in the scope of your question, but use only `range` in that case.
A user named chilimangos posted some code [here](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/1547) that allows you to grab an certain area of the screen (rather than the entire screen). This was much faster for me, since I was only interested in a small section of the screen. 
My text editor is configured to insert four spaces when I hit tab. 
... and literally every other code editor. 
Recursion? def f(i): try: i.do_something() except AttributeError: for j in i: f(j) f(animals)
Similar to https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic - what are the benefits of each?
Worrying over namespace pollution for a bunch of minor scripts seems a bit silly. 
I hope that you're aware that the `MessageHandler __init__` never gets called by any of the sub-classes.
I cannot say enough thanks for this. I didn't even know the {} string formatting syntax existed until this. 
Thanks!
I am using atom since start. What are py charm benefits? 
Software inevitably grows. A select few things (say, sin, cos, etc) are "very acceptable" to raise into the higher namespace. The other 590 parts of numpy should stay namespaced.
But why use such a calendar? Is there any calendar system under which year -1 is not unambiguously two years before year 1? Stranger still, why not allow years past 9999?
Because...? Again; you don’t know the context. 
Because raising something like `sin` or `cos` or `exp` will make your scientific code nicer to read. I would wager every programmer older than 13 knows those functions and understands their expected behavior. Raising `linspace` or `meshgrid` makes it more matlab-y and has some claim to that being the right thing to do. Essentially, people who do numerical simulation are very familiar with these names and how they should behave. Something like `dot` or `einsum` does not make sense; the audience who are very familiar with those terms is much smaller, and the implementation will probably differ enough between sources that there is a need to know where it comes from. Encourage good practice; don't be a stick in the mud and advocate shitty things like `from numpy import *` because it saves a total of 10 characters in a 30 line script. When the same person writes a 100 or 500 line script with the same * import, it will probably make everyone but their live's unnecessarily difficult, no matter how small the inconvenience.
Awesome visualization and cool geometry :)
PyCharm's a full IDE. Atom's an editor.
Maybe something like the following, so you can keep it general (granted I haven't tested this) def visit_nested(obj, depth=1): if not depth: yield obj for item in obj: yield from visit_nested(obj, depth - 1) # choose your iteration method for subgroup in visit_nested(animals, 2): subgroup.do_something()
The date you give is only ambiguous because it's not stated what calendar system is in use. Once we agree we're using proleptic Gregorian, there's no ambiguity about "-0289-08-01", is there?
Not enough JPEG. 
I'm sure some enterprising young soul out there can be convinced to turn the docs into an Imgur album.
Sounds like you are writing code in the IDLE Python Shell. Don't do that. Instead, go to File &gt; New File. A new window will pop up and you can write your code there. It's a normal text editor, so you can edit, save and load files. Plus there is a Run &gt; Run Module option to send all the code in the file to the Shell when you want to run it. --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython (this is not a help subreddit). Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
Thanks!
There's a disadvantage, but what are the advantages? 
Of an IDE over an editor? Inline debugging's the only one I care about. Actual developers probably care about a whole lot more than that, but that's the feature that gets me.
3,000 requests leaked 600MB!? My god what are you guys doing!?!?
I don't see any neither 
Could you support your code with some more text to clarify what you intend to do ? Some tests as well ? I usually read the tests to understand what the class is doing. I also tend to put in what the class doesn't do as well when it's important. 
An IDE manages a project were a text editor manages single files. With an IDE you can navigate through the project (find usage) and refactor safely elements. With a text editor, you must take care yourself of renaming and fixing imports in every file of the project folder. Also, even though I never use it, an IDE supports usually multiple kind of media, whether it's a source code text, image or sound. But usually those are handled by plugins and it's not really supported out of the box.
Meh. It’s no big deal. It takes a few seconds to change after the fact anyway. 
You should probably get PyCharm and learn the keyword command for quick fix come to think of it. 
A test is below those two classes. Sure, I’ll add more doc later.
Very rarely, when writing a 10 line script on ssh to a machine without my editor settings I will actually hit the space bar four or two times. The default tab (8) just looks huge. Otherwise, no. 
Cheating ruins the game for everyone mkay? That aside, I wrote a script that opens the battle net client and clicks the appear offline option in the menu, because it won't let me always start offline as a default. 
No. I'm super lazy. I just make a dev folder and put stuff in there. That's because some of the things I do takes 6+ months. At work, we use subversion, so I picked up bad habits.
Sadly ISO 8601 is not public, but [this wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Years) points out that by the standard you're only guaranteed that years between 1583 (the adoption of the Gregorian calendar) and 9999 are representable. As well, 0 is equal to 1BC, so maybe they just wanted to limit dates to AD representations for simplicity. Based on the [references](http://web.archive.org/web/20050205022329/http://zope.org:80/Members/fdrake/DateTimeWiki/SuggestedRequirements) in this [early commit of the datetime class](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/cf86e368ebd17e10f68306ebad314eea31daaa1e/Lib/datetime.py) they only explicitly call out the years 1800-3000, so absent a reply from a primary source (e.g. Guido) the most likely answer is "we didn't care about representing anything more than a few hundred years in the past". datetime doesn't support [leap seconds](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2010-June/007307.html) either. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
&gt; But why use such a calendar? Virtually every modern nation (if not all of them) has adopted the Gregorian calendar. I think it would be weird to think of using anything else for a standard datetime module. Python's was [written specifically](http://web.archive.org/web/20050205022329/http://zope.org:80/Members/fdrake/DateTimeWiki/SuggestedRequirements) to only support one calendar system, so Gregorian was the obvious choice.
python-magic is a wrapper for Linux library libmagic. It requires extra DLL to work on Windows. 
I hope this will make you aware you're wrong: class BaseClass(object): def __init__(self, arg1=None): self.arg1 = arg1 print('I am {} and I just got __init__ed'.format(self.__class__.__name__)) class Subclass(BaseClass): def method1(self): print('method1') s = Subclass() # I am Subclass and I just got __init__ed 
This is definitely more comprehensive, I already have my notes from Code Academy and other places on Notepad++ already. Might just go through this and piece what I don’t have that I could potentially use for later reference. The great thing about Notepad++ is it keeps the tabs from what you previously had even if you closed the program. It has come in handy!
I'm afraid at this point the cheat sheet is outdated. Python 3.6 (released a year ago) allows for f-strings which simplifies this syntax even more: ``` name = "Bob" print(f"My name is {name}.") &gt;&gt;&gt; My name is Bob. ```
Thanks a lot! I'll make output value equal to "extension" by default. I changed the code with your suggestion about context manager. Also, I checked the code with pylint and got 9.3 of 10. Unnittests passed good.
Yes, if you bundle it with something like PyInstaller or cx_Freeze. That said, your friend will probably be able to figure out what the program does, as the source code will be included in the .exe file.
Yea, that's a good point. It's not like actually browsing the source code (private methods and context), but it's indeed a good solution for simple method. I never heard about `get_magic()` or `getsourcefile()` - I will check what those do, thanks for the tip!
Are we speaking about PyCharm pluging? or Vim? :)
Amen to that :)
They'vre upstreamed this to be included in python3.7, which sounds awesome. It is fairly well known that pandas may need 5-10 times the memory of the underlying numpy array. Can this freeze numpy arrays as well? If so, this could give large improvements various numpy-based projects like pandas.
Thanks a lot!. I don't really mind if he figures out what it does. Just confirming though, my bundling with Cx_Freeze does that mean using cx_freeze to make it an Exe ( also, there are a lot of other files that are with the executable that are .py files, do those require python to be used because the executable can't run without them )
No, they don't require Python, the Python interpreter is bundled with the rest of the files. Also, you can use PyInstaller to make a single file executable.
Ok, tyvm once again
Why? It's a **free** online book. Just Google it. 
Just a note a single file executable will run a little slower starting up since it has to build everything in a temp folder. 
Looks great, and very comprehensive. Can you include something in the logic section about how to use 'and' and 'or' in practice? Beginners often think you can use it like in plain english: if choice = 'A' or 'B' or 'C': if x &lt; 3 and &gt; 4: ... and so on, but are surprised it doesn't work like this.
Yes, I guess you can but you need to modify the code for the news retrieval a bit. 
I really love the Instagram engineering blog. Each one is fascinating and insightful.
The author also shows how to use pybind11 which is arguably an improvement over cython for creating bindings for c++ code.
This resonates with the origin stories f Lisp or Ruby or Prolog, that the language is created to allow for expressing ideas, and only incidentally do they run on a machine. 
Neat; what are you using to sandbox execution? Docker?

I'm more into Python and C++ right now, so I probably won't start learning a new language any time soon.
Did he just show on his slides the transcript of his speech? In plain text? That he kept on reading from?
Dunno if I should make a new post about this, but might aswell ask you since you seem to know a lot about python. As you know I made an Exe to send to my friends. I can send it to my friends but when they try and run it, it opens for a split second then it closes. I can't really send my script here but any ideas on what's gone wrong. ( I don't really expect an answer because I can't send the script. But might aswell try ).
Yea markers/pens/pencils/highlighters dont work well on my monitor so I like to get the hard copy. Makes it easier.
of course, nothing ever works in this thing. output device cannot handle anything, let alone tkinter.
Fair enough! To each their own. Bonus points for supporting the author.
I'd very much like to know how we should be supposed to write it. The only pep warn i get from dowloading the .raw version on git is w292 "no newline at end of file". I wouldnt be suprised the said file has the \n ; Please check whatever you are using to read the code. It's all indented in spaces as well.
For vim by itself. I run in the Linux terminal, so I wouldn't have to worry about weird Windows incapabilities, etc.
Do you want to refer to QMainWindow and friends as just 'QMainWindow' (probably, because then your code will more closely match the C++ equivalents). If so, you don't need the first line: #from PyQt5 import QtCore, QtWidgets from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QMainWindow, QLabel, QGridLayout, QWidget from PyQt5.QtCore import QSize 
...every one worth using will, if you want.
One trick that I use to share imports between multiple .py files is the following. Put your common imports in a short module such as 'hdr.py'. In this example, suppose that I want to use the convention that modules are available by full module name (e.g. I want to type codecs.open, os.open, sys.path, etc.), certain modules are by short name (e.g. I want to type np.cos, np.sin, etc. for numpy's names and pd.read_csv etc. for pandas's names), and some utility functions that I wrote are unadorned (e.g. I just want to type isEmpty(...) and localeAwareCompare(...) in the code). Additionally, some common math functions that I use like sin, cos, tan shall be referred to unadorned as well, and when they are unadorned, I am referring to the Python Standard Library math functions, not numpy's. Finally, I am using PySide, and when I refer to PySide names, I want all of those names to be imported. For this I decided to use a * import because Qt generally already prefixes all of its names with Q anyway, making name conflicts unlikely. Finally, since this is a cross-platform project, I have introduced two helpful names MAC and X11 that quickly let me check whether I am on a Mac OS X system or a X11 (e.g. Linux) GUI system. The following hdr.py does the above: hdr.py: import codecs import functools import numpy as np import os import pandas as pd import random import re import sys from PySide.QtCore import * from PySide.QtGui import * from PySide.QtTest import QTest from PySide.QtXml import * from math import sin, cos, tan from util import isEmpty, localeAwareCompare MAC = "qt_mac_set_native_menubar" in dir() # PDF 233. def _has_X11(): import PySide.QtGui return hasattr(PySide.QtGui, "qt_x11_wait_for_window_manager") X11 = _has_X11() module1.py: from hdr import * # ... Code for module1 ... module2.py: from hdr import * # ... Code for module2 ... ... Now every module in my project uses the same convention, and all I have to do is type one line at the beginning of each module. Notice I used a temporary function in hdr.py that begins with an underscore _ to prevent that function from being imported by any of the user modules. User modules only use MAC and X11 for their logic, not the hidden function. 
Really interesting presentation honestly, and I think he hits the nail on the head. Sure, other languages may be faster, more efficient, more controllable than python, but part of why I'm using it over C# or whatever for my own stuff is that Python is possibly the best balance between functionality and expressiveness that exists in a language today. I mean we joke about python being executable pseudocode, but that's definite a big factor in its success. Python's syntax makes code clear and concise for new and experienced users alike, which is something that cannot be easily said for other languages. Though when it comes to performance, as someone who's particularly new myself I wonder if theres a reason you can't compile Python to get the performance of other lower-level langs, or close to it. *** Sidenote that I think its pretty cool that PyCon is hosted in less conventional places like Namibia, Iran, Iraq etc. Which definitely shows how global python is. Most tech conventions are plopped in the EU or US without much thought but it's nice to see Python's community trying to connect itself with places that are normally ignored.
Run the exe from the command prompt, type `cmd` in run dialog, change directory where the script is located and then type `myprogram.exe`. Copy ("mark") and paste output here.
asd 
Yup, but there are parts where he added to it. 
But with cython you just use python syntax and it gets compiled to C. All your python code lives next to your cython code using def or cdef. It's extremely simple to use and can produce very large speed ups. 
I'm coming over to python from a few years of c# and I can definitely appreciate its robustness. Not experienced with it enough with it yet to make a detailed comparison but so far it has all the basic stuff c# has. I'm a little uneasy about the weak typing though. That kind of stuff caused issues for me when I used xbase many moons ago.
Neat ; how does it compare with numeric.js in terms of performance?
Python is strongly typed. It also dynamically typed.
Can you be a little more specific, what do you want to run on it ?
Yes, containers
If you know C well, I think it's a good idea to learn how to create Python extensions/modules in C. It can teach you a lot about Python internals, plus it'll allow you create bindings for existing C libraries that don't exist yet in Python (or contribute to existing ones).
That's... Weird. Not sure if he presented it live or someone added it in post-production.
Fair enough, but I don't really believe those things should ever be integrated, since all that is already available in more focused tools, and you can always configure your text editor to use them instead. You can't make pycharm use vim/emacs/atom/whatever editor makes you the most effective, so whatever convenience it may bring doesn't beat the productivity loss of not having a good text editor. 
Gregorian is of course the obvious choice, but proleptic Gregorian permits dates before 1 AD, and beyond year 9999, so why doesn't Python?
Jesus. How does one keep up with all this?

Usually you would start with a data model, eg a class for a Cintact, another for a set of Contacts etc. Write some tests for that and then write the GUI against the data model. 
Yes, no. You should probably read about virtualenv or Conda env. 
I don't think he needs to start writing testcases while just learning to program... Note to OP: you should test your code early and often so that you get less confused, that is not what im saying.
Iv'e never tried tkinter, but qt and qt designer is great for gui programs... Watch some youtube tutorials on qt designer(it's very easy) and when you are finished with the design, save the file and run pyuic -x gui.ui -o gui.py and you can work from there. Thinking clearly is extremely important with programming, so separate your objective into smaller and smaller subtasks when you know exactly what you need to do and solve them iteratively. That said, i still think you should start with a book even though your program seems relatively simple. You can get far with a book just spending a day and youll figure out things that can take you weeks without one.
awesome ! thank you ... Ill stay away from books just because thats not my strongest preference when it comes to learning. Definitely going to look in to QT designer .. thanks again
I haven't tested, but given the fact that Numscrypt uses typed arays and simple standard algorithms (Gauss Jordan, Cooley Tukey etc.) I would expect it to be roughly the same. Neither uses GPGPU, which would really make a difference.
Will look into that and get back to you. May be a nice next step.
Yes, I realised this some hours after I posted. Moral of the story, never post in the early hours of the morning when you're dead beat :-(
Yes, no. You'll want to make sure all the packages you'll be using are available through conda. But yes, switching to Anaconda makes life alot easier on Windows.
Like with any code, there is a lot to nitpick. The two biggest points I see are the hashmap for `handle_message()` mentioned by others and the overly generic except clauses: Try to limit the except clauses to types you expect to be raised, otherwise you can easily hide bugs that lead to more problems down the line. (This is a general advice, though, not Python-specific.) Also, the `MessageHandler`class plus sub-classes look a bit "Java-esque" (or GoF patterned) to me. This could probably be handled using plain functions, like this: ``` def handle_message(...): ... action_handlers = { "send_device_status": handle_status_message, ... } handler = action_handlers[action] handler(json_msg2, queue, mconfig, json_msg2) ... def handle_status_message(...): msg_body = device_management.get_device_status_message() msg = OutboundMessage(routing_key=mconfig.OUTBOUND_QUEUE_NAME, headers='', message_lines=msg_body, message_type='devicestatus') send_message_to_cloud(mconfig, msg) queue.put("Device status requested and sent.") ``` But overall the code seems fine to me. 
If you have no background in the fundamentals of programming, a GUI is going to be a very painful undertaking as a first project. 
i have all the packages already running..but not pytorch..i need pytorch..you can install pytorch in windows using base python in linux/mac but not windows i have uninstalled the python using add/remove program windows..But it only uninstalled binary files for python 3.5..All the packages i had in Python are already there..should i delete them aswell?
You'd just use it to call the `??` you use in IPython programmatically. You'll notice them if you `jupyter nbconvert --to=python` a Jupyter notebook with, for example, `%% time` in some cell.
&gt; Can this freeze numpy arrays as well? If so, could this give large improvements various numpy-based projects like pandas as well? Yes this can freeze numpy arrays, no this won't have any effect on… anything, basically, unless you tend to fork processes after creating your base arrays. `gc.freeze()` only promotes objects to a permanent generation for purpose of the *cycle breaker* GC (not refcounting which is always active). It has an effect for Instagram because the cycle breaker walks all objects using an intrusive doubly linked list which is modified on each GC trigger for each object, which means all the pages containing these objects get written, and thus CoW-reallocated in the child process.
As a beginner, this would definitely be helpful as I have had to troubleshoot some instances of this because I didn't understand proper syntax and usage :)
Disabled the cycle-breaking garbage collector: https://engineering.instagram.com/dismissing-python-garbage-collection-at-instagram-4dca40b29172. They just have to generate 200K worth of garbage somehow rooted in a cycle per request. Considering [the size of standard Python objects](https://stackoverflow.com/a/30316760/8182118) (missing from there: instances of user-defined classes are 64 bytes in 64b Python 2, 56 in Python 3, not including their attributes-holding `__dict__`) it's pretty easy to allocate a lot of garbage, and I've never looked specifically but Django may generate cycles (and a fair amount of objects) as part of its SOP.
Start implementing your contact list just outputting it and manipulating it in your terminal. GUI is something complicated and you will write a bunch of stuff that you don't actually understand. If you really really want to have a decent user interface for your learning project, what about writing a web application and having your UI as a web page?
I wish it was staticly typed.
If this was 5-10 years ago I would agree with this idea, but today you are better off learning Flask and using that as a GUI for your program. This is a clear example of getting two birds with one stone. 
To be honest, I would say your first step would be to break down the problem that you're trying to solve into pieces first and have it work in the terminal, rather than the GUI. Let's say start with how you would enter text (using argparse) and then trying to store the value that you enter locally (as json maybe?) and then keep going until you're at the point where you have a functioning terminal app and then it won't be too difficult to port it into a GUI. However, it might be worth while asking that if you're a noob with programming and you do find that the GUI is the part that you're most interested in, you might want to look up front end development which is primarily focused on what the user sees. Good luck
`import typing` and go to town. 
I would take a step back and ask what limit you're exceeding for the API (usage? rate?) and then build your script to accommodate that restriction. Also, confirm inside your pycharm install as to what python environment you're using. In my experience, max tries exceeded with URL is not rate limiting but something breaking in an HTTP request. Good luck
Thanks for having a look and for your feedback! So, that's an interesting point regarding really classes vs plain functions. I guess I need to do some reading on that front because yes, you're right that in this case the class really doesn't do anything for me.
This is pretty neat! Question: why default to 2.7 instead of 3.6?
Ohh, I will look into that. Thanks 
Just: https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ajax_database.asp
It doesn't need to be pytho. Through your given link is it possible to do the pictures as well?
Yeah it is true it's bad to have things you don't understand in your code but I am learning so I just copied and pasted from the Youtube API example code to get something working and then tried to modify it.
Anything is possible if you put your mind to it.
starting with the gui usually leads to more problems and refactoring later. it's best to understand your data and how it should/will change before even beginning to build something interactive
Beautifully put. But as he stated "being at the right time, at the right spot". There have been many other ones. Point is, survivorship bias is at play here. Given the guy has worked at Google too and is well connected, he made the language a success. Not to say Python isn't amazing on its own. But take someone else, who probably wouldn't have been as well connected and the result is something different.
1. It's not actually that bad. There's a far amount of boiler plate, but I don't think that the learning curve is much steeper than learning the specifics of Cython, if you have prior experience as a C programmer. 2. Cython produces quite convoluted C code, which means that C code you write yourself is typically about twice as fast as Cython code. In edge cases, and whenever you're trying to write concurrent code (i.e. threads), the gap is much larger. I don't think I've ever released a Cythonized package to the open-source community, but I do use it professionally, for obfuscating code.

Summed up beautifully here [Why is Python popular, while Lisp and Scheme aren't?](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2002-November/141486.html).
Python’s most difficult times were long before Guido was at Google. Google hired Guido because they had ALREADY adopted Python. Those Google years were nothing special in terms of language growth which was already exponential before and after the Google years. Actually python has had much worse “luck” in its sponsorship and timing than e.g. C, Java, C#, JavaScript, Go, Swift, Objective C and even Ruby.

What is your programming expirence? How come you have to write a code that you are goinf to sell and don't know where to start? How long do you have ?
Interesting, thanks. What I'm thinking about here is actually using pandas dataframes and delivering the data through a web server. So, say the dataframe is 1 Gb in size and I fork the process that reads from the dataframe, I could save a gigabyte of RAM using ``gc.freeze``, right?
Yep that's what I'm talking about. It would be really nice
Fyi you should be aware of r/learnpython. It will be far easier for you, especially with no programming experience, to create a command-line contact manager. GUIs are kind of a pain in the ass, and not for your first project.
It's good for people who have trouble hearing. :-)
&gt; GUIs are kind of a pain in the ass, and not for your first project. I agree with this... one caveat might be if you really like GUIs or really want to make a particular program with a gui. I mean, things like opengl and the shader language are an utter pain but I would understanding why for some people they might the correct place to learn to program.
If you are making every group/subgroup a class you could just keep a reference to every object below
so guys is this an actual cheat sheet or not? I need to know before I order my pitchforks!
My experience is about a year of python and 4 months of java. My deadline is Thursday. And it's a very informal agreement with someone I work with currently in a restaurant 
Ok thank you , that's a good starting. Point 
This is literally in every Django tutorial. However, judging (harshly) from your post, you may want to start with figuring out how to print hello world instead. https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/tutorial01/
read the following two docs pages: * https://docs.python.org/2/library/functools.html * https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html Read them until you understand, and think about why / when they might be useful. Start using them until `map` and `zip` and `starmap` are as easy to use as `if/else`. 
Also look at mypy-lang.org for a type checker.
No particular reason, now that you bring it up, do you think there are more 3.6 users than 2.7 ?
I'd think so. Plus, every single article/blog/post out there tells people to move off of Python 2.
It was mostly an exercise in frustration for trying to develop GUI first. I learned a few things though and carried a lot of questions with me when I reset my learning to begin again. I re-started at square one with Python. There is much more content out there for learning Python from the beginning, from free to paid. Many others out learning with you with forums to support. Sometimes going with the flow can be helpful. No reasons to be strict about though. Freedom to explore has an innate motivation.
Lol sorry I didn't specify experience. I know how to do that but I'm use to having guidance and not having any resources to begin with is messing with me 
You still need to find a third party (well, not built in) type checker. By default, Python doesn't give a damn about your annotations. MyPy seems to be treated somewhat officially, in that it's hosted under the python github organisation.
First: what's wrong with using whatever version of python3 the server has already? &gt; I don't have the permissions to run gcc or g++ That would be very unusual. The problem is probably that configure is trying to save the resulting files in a directory you don't have access to. Try this: ./configure --prefix=folder/to/put/the/binary/in 
For a little more context: [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) can be used to check this typing information.
&gt; Given the guy has worked at Google too and is well connected, he made the language a success. Hmm... so my understanding this was *after* python had become successful. I think he was working in the Netherlands when he created python.
&gt; Actually python has had much worse “luck” in its sponsorship and timing than Hmm... so my personal folk story is that it caught the "scripting wave" slightly after Perl. In that sense the timing was good.
The version of Python that CentOS comes with is very old (I think 2.4?). I've already tried specifying the --prefix flag, but that has no effect if I can't even get a compiler to run in the first place. I'm sure the problem is with the permissions to run the compilers themselves. Just typing `gcc` and `g++` in the terminal will give me the `Permission denied` error.

Thank you very much and thanks for the fast reply. 
That's pretty much any IDE. Pycharm is probably the most popular, or Spyder. 
thank you, I cant stand the reddit player
PyCharm is nice but I find it quite complicated to use, as I need something beginner friendly. I wasn't able to find a visually appealing IDE for python that supported Input. 
Data science: iterable indexing and manipulation.
But I'll look into spyder
Fully commit to learning at least the basics, and it'll pay off in full. I can't calculate the amount of hours I've saved myself at work but I just using the Python basics to automate mundane tasks.
IDE's are inherently complicated. If you want something simple you will need a code editor. But you won't get those features you asked for. Some popular code editors are Notepad++ (Windows only), Geany, Atom, of Sublime Text (not free, but practically). Personally, I like Geany. Here's a long list of options: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/ide. Wikipedia also has good lists of [code editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_text_editors) and [IDEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_integrated_development_environments#Python). BTW, many (probably most) professional programmers find IDEs too bulky and slow and use advanced and hackable code editors to write code.
I suggest you spend some time on rosetta code http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Ray-casting_algorithm#Python
Sorry, but what is complicated in PyCharm?
Perl 5 marked my own move away from Perl. I loved Perl 4, but moving from 4 to 5 was like moving from C to C++, but with C no longer being supported. I moved to Java on the backend and JavaScript and Java on the front end instead (this was back when applets were all the rage). The online communities for both languages were much friendlier than that for Perl, which was an added bonus.)
Even if you have some level of background in programming, most times making a gui is still frustrating. 
&gt;BTW, many (probably most) professional programmers find IDEs too bulky and slow and use advanced and hackable code editors to write code. I dunno, man. Two things: 1) This is probably dependent somewhat on what language you are in. We are of course focused on Python here, and I'd say this is probably true of python and Javascript, but it seems a lot of people in some worlds rely heavily on IDEs almost as much as the language itself. C# for example really predominantly use an IDE like Visual Studio. Perhaps IDEs are more helpful for compiled languages in general. 2) Hackable code editors are really popular, and they are super cool and fun. They can be native desktop applications, or terminal applications, such as vim. And they can be modified to do what OP asks. However, their modular nature can sometimes be difficult to configure, and things can break frequently on update/reinstall due to compatibility issues between components. I do really enjoy working with these tools, but I often wonder if the sensation of coding in that environment is worth the **many countless hours** of configuration of the past several years. It's fun to play with all of them, but it really can be damned distracting. I think it is good for an early programmer to observe the language running in a more basic environment than an IDE for the first time. I remember learning python a few years ago and feeling overwhelmed and disconnected from what I was doing by using IDE's. However, after familiarizing myself with the experience of just working in code editors and terminals, I feel the productivity gains and focus of an IDE are quite useful indeed. Nothing feels as fun as a terminal, but work is work.
Interesting... it looks like you largely survived *without* a gluey / powerful / loose language and switched straight to Java. I imagine you may have used a bunch of bash for your glue? 
OP has zero programming ex
Learn the language first, then use an IDE. Don't try to learn both at once. 
I can imagine for someone who is unfamiliar with IDEs ( not sure if the OP is ), it will be pretty daunting. If your a seasoned developer, learning a new language, plus an IDE at the same time shouldn't be much of an issue. Depends on your experience / skill level. 
Yes: I would say that Perl, REXX, TCL and guile all had superior institutional support (O’reilly, IBM, Sun and Gnu respectively) and Python won on language quality, not institutional support. I started using it around 1994 after surveying those options. Python was late as a CGI or client-web language and that alone should have killed it as it did REXX. But it was just a very high quality language and it refused to die until it found a niche in scientific computing and now machine learning.
Fixed the issue. I added a 0.25 second pause after each call, and I don't get the error anymore when running in command prompt
That’s the right mix for me. I’ve wired static checking into Jenkins, but I’ve never wanted to enforce types at runtime.
At @7:00 &gt; Thanks to the events of this audacious woman who organized this even in a war-ridden country, students at Babylon University are now being taught introductory programming classes using Python. &gt; If it hadn't been for her [clapping...] they would be using Java.
there are alot of choice, you can use emacs or neovim as terminal base (it seem like NO RAM CONSUMTION) but need a little bit work. use Gvim or emacs GUI and get NO RAM CONSUMTION into gui use pycharm or atom with a great behavior but great RAM CONSUMTION.
single sheet filled with short tips? check! looks legit! 
&gt; not institutional support With my limited understanding I agree. I kind of think *timing* and being "good enough" is a though factor. REXX and Tcl both seem a bit too shelly (limited experience) to get big. Python not being destroyed by perl at an early stage *is* interesting. They both seem "programmatic enough to me" and in a way perl wins in terms of making common things easy (python values minimalism / consistency over convenience for some usecases, e.g. sys.stdin, subprocess and lack of magic for them etc). I don't know what I think about guile. Python was first so that may have been a factor. Guile is a lisp which may have been a hindrance. Also... I imagine the whole "embedding thing" and fact that gnu was focused on *big tools* may have been a factor. &gt; Virtually every other language lacking a niche or sponsor went away in the last 30 years I don't know what I think about `lua`... I get the impression it is really big for embedded programming (e.g. computer games, awesome window manager).
I had the same problem teaching high school students python. They needed an IDE capable of input, s code completion, and debugging but found PyCharm to be too complicated. Fortunately it turns out PyCharm had an educational version that is free and only had the basic important features. Consider checking that out if you want a simpler PyCharm. 
Possibly but probably not. I haven't looked but I would expect numpy implements its arrays as a single C object, the GC would only mutate the PyObject's header and copy a single page (4K or something?). The rest has no reason to be faulted unless you actually go and modify it. Furthermore in the case of a webserver the computation would most likely happen in the worker directly, not in the parent process.
Try with PySide/PyQt - I get 10 frames per second on my machine from PyQt4.QtGui import QPixmap, QApplication from datetime import datetime app = QApplication([]) while 1: date = datetime.now() filename = r'C:/%s.jpg' % str(date).replace(':','.') QPixmap.grabWindow(QApplication.desktop().winId()).save(filename, 'jpg')

For me it's the overall ugly and unintuitive layout 
Have you tried installing [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)?
This is more a general python cheat sheet for beginners. Please correct me if I'm wrong but hardly any of this is specifically for Data Science. 
I started with that book and found it nice but a little light. I moved to and liked Python Crash Course as a book for beginner programmers after going through 'LP3tHW'
Alternatively, look at the plotly server for enterprise. It allows hosting dash apps.
have you tried typing “pyuic5 path/to/file_to_convert.py” into your terminal? 
low res. grab your fork.
Holy crap, it worked! I can't thank you enough.
I tried that after reading your comment. This is the results I got on my terminal: Error: No such file or directory: "path/to/ModelParameter.ui" # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- # Form implementation generated from reading ui file 'path/to/ModelParameter.ui' # # Created by: PyQt5 UI code generator 5.9.2 # # WARNING! All changes made in this file will be lost!
Check out Visual Studio Code with the Microsoft Python Extension. I enjoy it's simplicity and that you don't have to create a project to work on a single Python file.
Ok, I have no prior experience but I have tried to learn through LPTHW multiple times. Most of the time I get to lesson 30ish and then get busy and never finish. So I know the very basics of python and am going back through and am in lesson 28. I think I will finish it and then do automate the boring stuff. Thanks for the input
Lol, take out the “path/to/“ and just type ModelParameter.ui. I meant Path/to/ to be the actual path of the file in the file system, but if it’s in the same folder as the executable you don’t need it.
His comment about Java got me laughing out loud. He said it beautifully.
Please tell me it's a joke
The high res is not the image on the page. There is a link there for it if you read though. 
It's a well-formatted beginner's cheat sheet, not much on data science. 
I'm working on file format identification library named "fleep" https://github.com/floyernick/fleep
That seems better, i will take a look at it.
Build a library that exposes an API first. Then a CLI version. If you're still not happy, look forward to implement a GUI frontend as well.
Those languages never had the coherence and momentum that Python has had, except maybe a few years back while community was split over Py 3
&gt; I realized that i have been writing python incorrectly since forever. Don't push this to the extreme, or you might get tempted to re-learn everything from scratch, that is loss of time. Just spot the rough edges and start fixing them one by one. Improving a legacy codebase is usually at least as productive as writing the same from scratch, especially if it's your own codebase and is a one man show.
I’d agree about GPGPU but I think it’s safe to assume you could wrap numeric and the JS VM is going to inline aggressively.
Agree about GPGPU but I’d expect a JS VM to aggressively inline any calls you make to numeric.js.
There are some inaccuracies, not much real value here I'm afraid. This may be the droid you are looking for: https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/
Actually as of this moment, i really don't have legacy code base to maintain anyway. Just research code, which is spaghetti anyway 
hottip: Get better at books. Book publishers have proof readers, multiple editions / refinements, a reputation to uphold, proper references, and are occasionally well written. The internet is full of A: Jerks, and B: People which must absolutely be correct. Sometimes the most valuable lesson is not being shown the 'right' way until you are ready. Programming is complicated. Learn enough Python to make a simple version of your program in a terminal, then build a GUI on top using tkinter. Tkinter can't be beat, simply because it is a built-in wrapper for some well matured C code. This book has an intimidating title, but the author seems like a regular dude. Had me making nice GUIs in no time. https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tkinter-GUI-Application-Development-Blueprints-ebook/dp/B018SNZNEI 
Yeah, easily the best Python reference out there in my opinion. 
Project Euler https://projecteuler.net/archives I’ve started solving the problems in python. Potential homework maybe. 
You could do it functionally... http://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/map_filter.html
I’m not exactly sure what problem would it solve
Well doing this in python is definatly possible, for dataframes you can use pandas, but python at least in my expirence is not very well known for its beautiful GUIs. If you don't care how it looks there is an module that lets you draw things on a canvas similar to paint. It also can register where you click. You could easily couple that with pandas to get something ugly but functional. I don't remember the name of the drawing module, but I will look it up tomorrow. This is far from the best solution so you might want to google phython GUIs. Happy new year.
We just use boto3's deserializer. Have not needed more than that yet.

It's probably easier to use GeoPandas.
The tutorial shows how to add different "help" elements for usage. docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html
There are some things in your code sample that show a misunderstanding of the things you're using. It made me wonder whether this is a habit that needed addressing. Make sure to read the documentation for methods that you use. For instance, [here's the documentation for `dict.get`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.get). You can access part of the documentation using the [`help` builtin function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#help). Calling `help(dict.get)` gives: Help on method_descriptor: get(...) D.get(k[,d]) -&gt; D[k] if k in D, else d. d defaults to None. Calling `help({}.get)` gives: Help on built-in function get: get(...) method of builtins.dict instance D.get(k[,d]) -&gt; D[k] if k in D, else d. d defaults to None.
Hey nice one -- this makes drawing the scenes instantaneous.
For some reason, attempting to download the image, it's blurry for me.
you can do periodic updates after each drawing step, too. drawsky() window.update() clouddraw() window.update() drawmountains() window.update() Hey, btw, it's good to explicitly refer to the `screen` in your program. Also allows it to work in PyCharm. At the beginning: import turtle window = turtle.Screen() // so I can call mainloop() window.tracer(0,0) grass = turtle.Turtle() // because I 'import turtle' instead of 'from turtle import Turtle' grass.color('#007b0c') At the end: window.update() window.mainloop() //Prevents PyCharm from puking over the external Tk window
