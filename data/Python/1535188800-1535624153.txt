I haven't looked into it yet, but I keep hearing about [anvil.works](https://anvil.works/) every time Python devs rant about JS and web frontend. 
Google it...
That transform looks so simple... Curse you UTM! ;)
http://timvieira.github.io/blog/post/2014/02/11/exp-normalize-trick/ Here is explained how to do it numerically stable. Then you only have to define your exponential function, which again can be googled or naivly implemented with a fixed value for e and the ** operator. All of this can be found on the first page of google.
one doesnt simply dislike js by saying they dislike js while entering text into a comment box which gets validated by js :)
&gt;without any in-built modules such as math module &gt;import math
Just search how to implement math.exp
Google is your friend in this situation and generally should be your first go-to when you need an answer because it's almost certain that any question you can ask, has already been answered or at least will put you on the right path. For a general case of implenting a mathematical function, you first need to understand the mathematics behind it and then build it from the basic functions already implemented in your language.
Thank you
Thank you
I am not able to understand anything in that blog Can you provide an simple explanation and implementation please?
I would stop re-inventing the wheel and just wordpress it.
No
Because OP probably doesn't know anything about period.ordinal. that's how OP found out about the missing doc.
&gt; the slowest thing in test suites is creation, setup, and teardown of a database Using a RAM disk really helps with this, and anything that is heavily database/file-system dependent. Obviously it's no good for most performance tests (though it can be useful to largely isolate disk performance).

For a good explanation of neural nets in python i would watch the first few Andrei karpathy stanford winter 2016 videos on YouTube and basically ignore this article. It covers basic essentials : * non linearity * loss functions * differentiability * gradient descent * backpropagation * actual python code This article: * sklearn.fit(x) * neural networks are like the brain * a picture of a sigmoid * an explaination of what "sum" means
Looking forward to this book and especially the hands-on excercises.
Ffs lad. Look up the formula for a sigmoid and type it out. Exp(x) is simply 2.71 ** x. Add some more decimal places for accuracy. 
&gt; Callback hell. Promises make it slightly better but it’s still pretty horrible to read. Async/await have further improved readability. Anyways, this is all necessary in JS because JS was made to handle user interaction efficiently. &gt; Also type coercion and all the prototype abuse. Agree. &gt; And then Npm Npm is one of my favorite things about node. Managing packages with npm is far better than what Python offers. In fact, pip’s install-everything-globally mindset makes virtual environments a must. It adds a level of complexity which is strictly unnecessary in node with npm. &gt; the frameworks, the compilers, everything is crap and everything gets rewritten every 5 days because there is no stdlib. Mostly agree.
I didn't know what this was, but after a (very little) digging: &gt;&gt;&gt; pd.Period('8/25/2018').ordinal 17768 &gt;&gt;&gt; pd.Period('1/1/1970').ordinal 0 &gt;&gt;&gt; pd.Period('1/2/1970').ordinal 1 As u/Kivou implies, open source projects obviously rely on people helping improve them where they can. Pointing out issues l like this is part of the process, but at some point somebody needs to actually go beyond complaining that something hasn't been done to their satisfaction.I didn't know what this was, but after a (very little) digging: &gt;&gt;&gt; pd.Period('8/25/2018').ordinal 17768 &gt;&gt;&gt; pd.Period('1/1/1970').ordinal 0 &gt;&gt;&gt; pd.Period('1/2/1970').ordinal 1 
Thank you 
Can confirm, just googled pandas period ordinal just to get the empty documentation.
You should [open an issue](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues?q=is%3Aopen) at least.
Trying to understand something and fix it is way too much to ask for. Even reporting an issue is beyond what most people are willing to do. We need to find a way to lower the barrier of entry for improving the ecosystem. &amp;#x200B; Also -1 for pandas is easy to contribute to. It is one of the most complex codebases around. Even building docs is an adventure.
&gt; Be careful with this though. Filtering is best done by the database: It's faster, and you won't have to write the filtering code yourself. Yeah, I don't like that part either. You don't have to grab all records from the DB just to do a filtering when it was a simple query. As an alternative, I would define a clear layer where DB access is performed. For example, you could use ORM query there to fetch the records and convert results to namedtuples, dataclasses or other simple value objects that you can pass around easily.
That method name doesn't give a single clue about his functionality
For a stand-alone script you’d be right, but this is going to fit into a wider system of related but not technically dependent code. The inputs will be changing in the future and it’s infeasible to allow that with VBA. 
The source code is available here, if you want to look at it. https://github.com/MaxwellSalmon/DUGA/ I don't think I'll have to say it is messy sometimes :-)

They seem to have good marketing thats for sure. I don't see why anybody who cares about Python would even mention this.
Obviously it works on dates? I mean I guess if you work with time steries, it's reasonable that that's part of the lingo. Numpy doesn't teach you how to solve for eigenvalues. You're expected to know how to do it, but it's probably more less buggy/faster than the method you know.
Isn't videodownloader the tool that started as a simple script and was initially posted in this subreddit a month ago or so? 
If you can't be bothered to write an issue/pull request/ask a question/respond to the polls I put out on the open source project I run, how am I supposed to know what's confusing? Read stackoverflow posts where people are using a version from 5 years ago on a 7 year old project, yet are posting today? I ignore whiny and accusatory tickets, especially from people that have been argumentative and unreasonable in the past.
Coincidentally enough I have been working in this exact situation. I wrote a script that connects to multiple exchanges via websocket or rest and consolidates the tickers into a dictionary which is then served using Flask. I only needed these modules requests websocket-client flask threading Each thread handles its own exchange and all of them update the same global dictionary.
Agreed 100%. People are lazy. How many people use open source? How many people contribute back, even if it's something simple such as opening an issue and fixing docs? How many people contribute regularly?
Sorry to hear that, I guess it differs from user to user. In my case I use it when I need to learn another language, and I quickly go through lessons, gets you a general feeling. From then on, just like anything, it's just practice and working examples. Wish both of you well!

I do use PyQt5 on mac. It works absolutely fine. I install Qt via brew, I hope you have that installed brew install qt then I install PyQt5 pip3 install PyQt5 You can open the Designer by going to the Qt installed directory open -a /usr/local/Cellar/qt/5.11.1/libexec/Designer.app be mindful of the version.
They don't, but FFS, don't complain on reddit then. I ran into a bug with numpy's version documentation. It was just wrong. I'm a big kid and fixed it. Doesn't need a big show. I also found a problem in savetxt and a work around in loadtxt. I didn't spend much time on the issue. I just was working on my own task and looked into the cause. I guess I could ditch numpy because loadtxt didn't work...or I could backport the bug fix everytime I upgrade or just report the bug.

Awesome pal hope you don't mind me asking but how do you recover from websocket timeouts/errors, this was the main error I was encountered using node which was killing my loop no matter what handlers I added.
Indeed, that was the tricky part for me. I used this code: while True: try: ws.run_forever(ping_interval=5) except Exception as e: pass this little snippet auto reconnects your socket everytime it disconnects or times out.
Very good pal, tried something similar using the child process in node and it would reconnect but every once in a while the child process would die and kill the loop. Might pick your brains when I get a bit further into the project if you don't mind.
If you have 2FA on Google you need to create separate password in Google account settings for your app.
Interesting, in Python for a child process/thread to die it must finish doing all its functions or have an exception. The while loop and the runforever method are used to avoid that, it will keep running the socket until something really bad happens.
I tried, and [I do not have that option] on my regular, US gmail account.
Yeah from what I've read python seems to be more resilient in this case. Seems that the child processes can cause errors in the main event loop (or block it somehow) causing random timeouts. The handlers I attached seemed to catch some but not all of the exceptions but the trace was always identical. I'm new to python so some of the questions might seem stupid pal. On a separate note how far along are you with your project? I'm trying to plan my time (not much of it due to kids) for the project and was hoping to have the data acquisition side of the project done in about 12 hours over a couple of days, just wondering if this is realistic. 
Sure, no worries. It took me about 7 hours to get it all sorted out. I had to research each individual exchange APIs and implement them manually (Bitmex, Bitfinex, Binance, Bittrex and coinegg). This project was for a client that needed all that data in realtime and saved it to .csv's which will be later used for a trading bot (the trading bot part is not made by me).
Can someone here post a link/vid that shows how to create a separate password for apps? That wasn’t clear to me when I was searching around. Oh yeah, my script on Pythonanywhere hit into the same issue/problem. I think I solved it temporarily by logging into Gmail and saying it was an authorized device/location. 
3. Now you get to tell the class why that is.
Start with 3. 2 is effectively dead.
For database I would recommend SQLite, it comes bundled with Python and its really good because of its ease of use and portability (only one file). In this [link](https://gist.github.com/agentphantom/01c30340fda48b4e8eac8e59af99b370) you can see another Bitmex script I wrote. This one was for liquidations but its very similar to the tickers one. This is the url to get all the tickers: wss://www.bitmex.com/realtime?subscribe=quote
Spot on pal, format of the websocket is nearly identical to the stuff I have previously written in node so I think I might get my head around it quicker than I thought. Is that your discord bot? Wouldn't mind subscribing to get away from using Twitter.
The discord bot is for the grabs, you can run it on your Pi, you would only need to create your own Discord server. Once you have your Discord server, there's an option to create a webhook and assign it to a channel, the webhook is basically just an url to post data to. Once you got the webhook url you only require to put it on the linked script and run the script. It will automatically do the same as the twitter bitmexrekt thing. Just make sure to install the required packages through pip.
I’m not in front of my computer right now, I think there’s some area for suspicious activities (it flagged a device/IP it hasn’t seen before) and I clicked some button that said essentially “that was me” so I thinks it’s ok until Gmail flags it again into the future— not sure what triggers that though
I'll message you
The GeoDjango docs are a great example of this. It's like they started writing them and then quit halfway through. 
I also face the same issue. 
Got a lot to read up on was thinking of having the bot report over telegram or similar as the API is really low on resources, what's the discord server like on resources if this was on a pi?
Sorry to ask but I've been having a read through the docs for the packages you listed and wondered if you could clear something up regarding the architecture, if I was to write multiple websocket python scripts (one for each exchange I'm going to use) stored in my root imported them to my main script and then called them via threading this would make the program multi threaded and I would have access to the exchange websocket from the main thread by calling the imported script? Is it then just a matter of handling the data and writing to the database?
You actually don't need to host the Discord bot, it is created online on the Discord website. The script only sends a POST request to the Discord API which posts it to the channel. I would say it uses very few resources, but if you want something a bit more reliable you can always use a cheap VPS such as DigitalOcean's 5 usd/month..
Would you like to talk about it?
Did you try this solution? https://support.google.com/a/forum/AAAA034zvV8LFIrxblUozs/?hl=en 
Ahhhh I hadn't got that far into the docs when the question popped into my head, for some reason I thought each thread had to have its own script. Never realised multi-threading was that easy in python. Gonna try and put a couple of hours in over the weekend and get Coinbase pro working as it's the exchange I have the most experience with. Might give you a shout Mon/Tue depending on how far I get. Thanks for the advice pal 
Yes, that was my first step to allowing \`smtplib\` to access my account.
Pics or gtfo.
The import part is the avoidance of numerical overflow here. That is that no value becomes greater than the type it is stored with can hold.
Doet. Super easy to get started. 
Your script is working, and i have got response.url : ('I Just Visit: ', '[https://www.onparts.gr/amaksoma-eksoplismos/amortiser-aeriou?limit=20](https://www.onparts.gr/amaksoma-eksoplismos/amortiser-aeriou?limit=20)') &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
yes sir, but in the export file does not apear the visit information, just exporting the other stuff 
&gt; Numpy doesn't teach you how to solve for eigenvalues. You're expected to know how to do it, but it's probably more less buggy/faster than the method you know. A method shouldn't be named according to how it does what it does (you have to treat methods like black boxes or we would go crazy) rather what it returns. So the name numpy.linalg.eigvals is ok because it returns eigenvalues, [pandas.Period.is_leap_year](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Period.is_leap_year.html) is another good example, although the description in the documentation is empty too (just like the case exposed by bbrinx), the name make it easy to guess what it does. In the other hand pandas.Period.ordinal doesn't tell you anything, it could easily be name pandas.Period.days_since_epoch and everyone would understand what it does. 
Wow, that's awesome! What did you use for tracking the mileage and swim distance? Or was it all manual collection?
This isn't an "issue"-- it's intentional. Using simple username and passwords on smtp completely voids the purpose of 2fa. You can do one of the following: * create an app and token, using the token as your password * create an app password via security.google.com, use that as your password * send emails through the gmail api instead
Hi! I work in this field. Keeping up with blockchain innovation mostly happens through reading papers. Developing for it is no different than normal development, with the exception that mistakes can and will cost other people money. I would advise to start with any development (not necessarily specialized to blockchains) and a lot of source code reading. 
&gt; A method shouldn't be named according to how it does what it does Ideally, I agree, but they often are, because they're fundamentally different. They have different assumptions and that's built into the method. It's descriptive by doing that. An example is scipy.optimize.fmin_l_bfgs_b. It's like saying optimize; that's a little to general. OK, well by gradient; also too general. So when should I use fmin_l_bfgs_b vs. fmin_bfgs vs. fmin_cg vs. fmin_ncg vs. fmin_powell vs. one of the 20 other methods? Google the methods seems like the most reasonable first step and filter out a few. Then just try them or pick one. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.fmin_l_bfgs_b.html My point was that if you're going to be accessing the attributes of objects, you getting into implementation details and probably shouldn't expect 100% documentation, even in pandas. &gt; if it's name was pandas.Period.days_since_epoch Seems reasonable and yet that would break backwards compatibility :(

Are you deadset on Qt? &amp;#x200B;
Or you could do normal DB queries. If what you care about is ensuring the generated queries are correct, mock away the DB and inspect the SQL being sent to it. If what you care about is a full integration test including DB, you're going to take the hit of using a DB during testing. Redesigning the entire application to use bad DB practices just to get faster tests is the opposite of good testing practice.

It's far worse when you're paying for it. Here's the "Quick Start Guide" For Dew Research's MtxVec, something like NumPy for Delphi and C#: https://www.dewresearch.com/Help/Delphi/MtxVec/!!QuickStart_VCL.html Here's Numpy's: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.1/user/quickstart.html MtxVec costs $599 with source code. Here's the rest of the "documentation": https://www.dewresearch.com/Help/Delphi/MtxVec/contents.html TeeBi is a product from Steema that's again like Pandas for Delphi. $279 with source. The reference guide is atrocious: http://www.teechart.net/docs/TeeBIVCLReference.htm And the tutorials are just a few paragraphs apiece: http://teechart.net/docs/teebi/tutorials/index.html Worse, here's the quality of some of the information: &gt;TeeBI provides native access to Python runtime by using the &gt;Python4Delphi library &gt; &gt;This library is embedded in TeeBI so its not necessary to download it. &gt; &gt;The unit containing Python4Delphi classes is &gt;BI.Plugins.Python.Engine.pas &gt; &gt;Python and Scikit-Learn runtimes can be downloaded and installed from &gt;their main websites.... &gt; &gt;Or, for an easier installation, you can download the "Pandas" library &gt;that includes both and much more.... Yes, download Pandas to get Python and the Scipy "runtime".... sigh. 
That sounds like a bit of a mess... is it not possible to just use a venv that matches the remote environment?
So not to rain on your parade but it seems that you have just used numpy’s fft. While what you have made is actually really nicely structured python I wanted to encourage you to try actually writing your own fast Fourier transform in python. This is a great way to learn about how the algorithm works. I have met so many people who use the fast Fourier transform and never understand why it works which is really a shame since so much of modern technology is based on it. Also if you have to work with ftt on any sort of regular basis I highly recommend using the fftw library. It’s much faster for reasons that will become apparent when you write your own version. Also look into the intel math kernel library which I’m pretty sure has the fastest implementation available at the moment because it is optimized for running on intel chips. Happy digital signal processing! 
Beautiful game aesthetic, I just can't help but wonder how must easier this would have been with another game engine.
I saw that script and made one (that also converts to mp3). 
Afaik you don't need SSH access for pycharms remote debugger. That's only for it to execute things for you. All you need is to copy the pydevd package from pycharms bin, import it and then connect over a port. As long as there's an IP and port you should be able to connect with the remote debugger. Though you'd probably want some kind of shell access anyway.
While Python is cross platform, some third party modules are not. 
It's Australia... I think they have to go down.
Editors like PyCharm aren't really designed for this kind of work. These editors emphasize "projects", i.e. some static description of what you are working on, which should control which things are exposed to you in your working environment, which options should be made available etc. This comes from thinking that, basically, "user is a moron, and needs to be protected from bad choices", which, probably, reflects the reality of people who design these tools. And, because these tools try to predict and proscribe you the "best practices", they don't try to be always correct, they try to be correct for the average case. So, with some effort, you may find a way to interact with Python's interpreter running in a Docker container, but then some other things won't work. Like, maybe, opening files from your working environment, or maybe code intellisense etc. I believe you would have much easier time using Python interpreter running in container, if you used Emacs or Vim. In particular, because those editors are used by people who often do need to deal with complicated setups, spread over multiple computers and operating systems.
Thanks for the post, time for a binge!
I'm glad to hear that the Python devs are decent about their bug reports, especially given the scale of the operation and the number of false ones they must receive. That sounds like a breath of fresh air compared to what a large "open source" vendor has done in my experience (ignore things for months or in one case, years and it still continues).
Thanks for posting this. I’d actually forgotten it was this weekend as I couldn’t go. 
Waiting for the incoming ffmpeg one-liner
This is nowhere near as cool as anything else here, but felt like sharing anyways. I'm making a command line Tic-Tac-Toe game. I'm an absolute beginner, so this game is made up of 15 functions and more if/elif/else statements than I care to admit, but it's my first project and I'm excited to see it done (I've only got a handful more lines to write, hopefully)! I'm definitely planning to come back and put my version 1.0 to shame once I've got a better grasp on Python. If anyone wants to look it over and suggest things to me, I could put it on Google Drive or github tomorrow and link it. Anything you could suggest to me would be much appreciated!
I use python all the time for various types of neural networks and learning systems. Although I don't really use any external libraries, a very good article.

Pycharm has a gui that works by calling pip, which means it works like you expect it to. When you create a new project, it generates a new virtualenv for it by default.

Output the figure created to a file and then view that file. You've created a script, which are designed to be run in the background. The output should all be saved to the disk, not stored in memory. 
Run it from command line
No, it's not possible for several reasons. The environment has non-python packages which are not trivial to install, that's why I use docker container and not a venv in the first place. Also the remote machine is much more powerful, has more ram and the large datasets I work with are also located at that machine.
SSH in itself is not a dealbreaker - I control the remote machine and can install anything in the docker container. However, this will certainly not work for plots, and maybe some other things.
It seems that pycharm supports the individual parts of my setup, e.g. remote interpreters, docker containers, and even jupyter notebook or its own sciview for plots. So, they probably considered similar workflows. However, combining these pieces together turns out to be nontrivial, if possible. As for emacs/vim - you mean just running them alongside the project in the same container? Anyway, I really like code editor features like autocomplete, navigation and others in pycharm, and (to a bit lesser extent) in VS Code. Also, I'm not at all familiar with emacs or vim.
Try the code module. This will stop for debugging Import code #your stuff code.interact(banner='',local=locals())
Read my other thread... 
Highly dubious article.If your query is slow, it means you may need to add needed indexes. Doubt moving the filtering to python will help your application. If it does, you really don't need a database at all. 
As u/michaelkim0407 said, use the command line. You could also put `input()` at the end of your script. It will wait for you to hit `Return`.
That's why i opted for Atom. Atom + remote hydrogen kernel + remote file sync + autoreload is a great combo. Debugging isn't good yet, therefore I open a remote console separately. With this workflow I have the flexibility of Jupyter notebooks while directly coding my project for production purpose. 
Could you give a bit more details on your setup? Also, does it give autocomplete and file navigation for code and libraries?
Thank you very much for your comment and your information. As you suggested I will try to implement my own Fourier Transform today.

You want to use a remote interpreter to make a plot? On your screen, or on the remote screen? Does the remote have a GUI or X?

I didn't look too much into it, but here is a promising command line program. [https://github.com/slhck/ffmpeg-normalize](https://github.com/slhck/ffmpeg-normalize) This shouldn't be too hard to code yourself either, using scipy and/or numpy. 
No. Docker implements its own half-arsed version of remote shell access (a.k.a. \`docker exec\`). You can use that to run the interpreter / debug / profile etc. But you don't need to run SSH.
No, you don't need to install Vim / Emacs in the container. I'm not sure how this is done in Vim, but I saw people do it. In Emacs, there's Tramp, it can be configured to execute commands / work with files etc. over multitude of protocols, it can also utilize `docker exec` and friends to work with containers.
Installing SSH in Docker containers is usually frowned upon. Of course, there's nothing criminal about it, if you are doing it for your personal project, but it would be quite a hassle, if you are doing it in a company setting. Furthermore, Docker doesn't play well with `init.d`, `systemd` and such. This is while services like SSH would normally be run by these programs. This means, that you would have to also write some sort of a wrapper (not really complex) for restarting SSH server each time you connect or disconnect. PS. Yes, I stand by what I said: JetBrains devs. don't develop programs for experienced / knowledgeable programmers. Their audience is inexperienced programmers, or folks for whom programming is secondary to their main profession (eg. scientists). There's nothing wrong with it from a commercial point of view: there's a lot more of that kind of users. But, it's something to keep in mind when selecting your tools.
&gt; And then sell this information to DSPs / SSPs, who will in turn sell it to smaller companies doing media acquisition / ad campaign management. Hello paranoia
LOL, you are being excessively kind here. I was considering more of a flame-thrower response to this disguised plagiarism when realized that your polite response shows better manners.
Well, I'm not tied to pycharm in any way, so any IDE/editor with reasonable autocomplete and navigation would work. I tried VS Code but also didn't find how to setup this (and if it is possible at all), will probably try Atom as suggested above.
I actually worked for a small media acquisition company. We bought this info from Google. I don't know the details, but it's not anything exclusive. Anyone can do it.
Perhaps, but the purpose of 2fa is not a quick buck. They could make more money, quicker, by selling other data.
What you are looking for a compression tool. Like Stereotool. https://www.stereotool.com/products/ This one is not free (Disclosure, I have bought a licence), but sounds great and has a command line interface, so you can call it from Python. Because it's not an easy task to compress audio file volumes. The program @gtiptip mentioned doesn't even out differences within one file... Alas googling for free alternatives is hard, mainly because of all the seach results for compressing files to mp3 and such... 
I see you would like to advise Google on how to invest their money :) That's a very noble goal. Well, from security perspective 2fa is nonsense / nobody takes it seriously, but it does have serious implications for advertising. Maybe there are some other mysterious uses for it, but I wouldn't know anything about that.
I'm working my way through the book Obey the Testing Goat. It's a joy to read.

Wrote a simple post that explains how to [export Pandas DataFrame to Excel](https://datatofish.com/export-dataframe-to-excel/).
I’ve seen this kind of thing before in academia where you get a lot of people who are learning a lot all at once. Fourier transforms are one of those topics that should really have a class unto themselves. Instead they are more often presented as a finished product with little or no explanation of how they work. This problem often gets compounded in the case of the fast Fourier transform: often all that young programmers see of it is the frequency spectrum with little or no explanation of how they got there from the fft, what the fft is, or why any of this works. The result are often projects like this which are really best described as plotting a spectrum. I can speculate on why this is the way things are taught. Frankly though I have never understood why we insist on presenting people with an algorithm that represents 200+ years of thought by some of the greatest mathematicians ever to live, and then expect them to understand it after two power point slides and a half hour of lecture... This is all a long winded way of saying that I empathize with OP. I was once in their shoes and had to figure it out on my own. Fortunately, there was someone who pushed me to dig deeper and really understand and I am so much better for it. So I pay it forward. 
Yeah. Filtering is best done by the database. I don't agree with that part. But DB access is better to be isolated and done in a single layer. If that layer returns value objects (rather than Django model objects with DB dependency) that are then passed around, all other layers don't have a dependency on the DB anymore and can be easily tested without mocks.
Yes, this is a very good tool, but only normalises the file. Which is lowering or increasing the volumen of the whole file, not parts of it, which was the original question.
I appreciate your thoughts and comments. First of all in order to clarify, I watched a video from 3blue1brown about the Fourier Transform which got me excited and I decided to make a script that actually does what was described in the video. After my implementation using Numpy, I tried to search more about Eulers formula, complex numbers and integrals ( I am a high school student so sadly these topics are not taught in school) and I wrote a script that performs a Fourier Transform (I am not sure if this is the FFT though), so far it works great and it was a very intersting way to spend a couple of hours.
What got me started was the 3b1b video about the Fourier Transform so I will definetely check them out! &amp;#x200B;
I would also like to thank you for giving 18 stars. I really appreciate it :)
Seems to me that it’s Docker that’s aimed at morons who can’t be bothered to deploy their software appropriately...
Interesting idea! My first thought is to use a parts-of-speech tagger to identify email subject lines that include imperative verbs ("act" in "act now" "wait" in "don't wait"). Apparently Python's Natural Language Toolkit built-in tagger [struggles](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32224227/nltk-identifies-verb-as-noun-in-imperatives) with imperative verbs, however, and it doesn't look like it tags imperative verbs separately anyway, so there might not be an out-of-the-box solution. You might have to train your own tagger on email subject lines, as recommended in this [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/9572724/9809094) answer. I'm just a beginner in NLP, so take this advice with a grain of salt.

That’s really cool! I never encountered anything like this in highschool. I think one of the most exciting things going on on the Internet right now is the availability of high quality explanations of some of this stuff. Kudos to you for feeling the urge to build something based on it. I think I can help clear up som of your confusion regarding the naming: The Fourier transform typically refers to the continuous function, it is an integral from -info to inf. The discrete time Fourier transform or discrete Fourier transform is the same concept but for discrete functions (think summations instead of integrals) but it is still a summation from -inf to inf. Not very useful for empirical data. The short time discrete Fourier transform is the version you are seeing here and the version most often used. As it’s name implies, it estimated the dft from a short time span of evenly sampled measurements. The fast Fourier transform is an algorithm that allows us to very rapidly compute the short time discrete Fourier transform of a sample of data. It took about a hundred years, and generations of mathematicians to get from Joseph Fourier to the FFT. 
It might be easiest to use reset_index to clear the indices and then the sort should work

Good bot
Nlp wise there are plenty of things you could do... My advice is not to over think it like make a neural network (unless u are going for stellar 99.999% accuracy and have a lot of data to train from) U definitely need to get more data from the subject lines them selves, like synthesize them or model them or something. Nlp is useful here. If u gather enough info from the subject line, you can train a much simpler algorithm called a decision tree classifier. They are pretty light compared to neural nets, easy to make, and there are several libraries that make it easy to train an build them.
There's a systems settings pane called "drivers", which gives you the option between nouceau, nvidia and nvidia-390xx drivers. It is equivalent to running `sudo apt-get install nvidia`, without having to Google "what drivers should I install with my card", essentially.
Yeah, never had those work before. I just goto the nvidia (the vendors) website and click on drivers in the menu. No googling required and the instructions for how the drivers should be installed is right along with it.
dont be naive. tech companies, and especially ad companies like google, are constantly coming up with excuses to tie your phone number to your account. people tend to have a good number of email addresses, but phone numbers are much more personal. this makes their creepy profiles on users much more certain. and yes, these benefits are obviously passed along to 3rd parties.

I take it you're using PythonAnywhere? Also, what kind of data are you scraping, I wonder? Good luck with your project!
First project was getting my local weather report from [yr.no](https://yr.no) and emailing it to myself with a throwaway gmail account. Second project will be analysing local dam levels from a csv hosted online that is updated daily by the government. 
A few months ago I implemented this simple flask app that processes a dataset file (called supermarket.arff) from Weka and gives recommendations based on an existing market basket. &amp;#x200B; Despite its simplicity, I feel like it is worth sharing, cause sometimes we don't really understand how websites and other applications recommend things. They probably use different approaches or technologies other than this one, but this is an easy to implement item recommendation application, using association rules and apriori. &amp;#x200B; You can run it with docker by simply calling \`docker-compose up\`.
Not good.

A lot of 2fa-protected crypto has been stolen. It's not very hard to get someone's phone number and the telcos are too easily fooled into sending out a replacement sim card. Of course this satisfies your critera for "shitty implementation" but it's sadly all too common to use a phone for 2FA.

&gt; Of course this satisfies your critera for "shitty implementation" but it's sadly all too common to use a phone for 2FA. Otherwise everyone's got to go around with a keyring full of hardware authenticators. You don't need either-- something as simple as one of the many MFA apps and a TOTP based algorithm work just fine. Your phone can hold your key. Just you shouldn't make your key linked externally (phone number and by proxy sim card). Many companies allow *multiple* methods of 2fa. Those that only allow the shitty ones, shame on them. But after that, if they allow TOTP + app, you can only blame the user.
I'm just more familiar with the triangulation functions in *matplotlib*. I use *matplotlib* to generate contours. One can also smooth the contours. I also use *matplotlib* to determine point height on a dtm and to generate profiles. It is also possible to load your own triangulation into *matplotlib*. Sometimes I want to generate constrained delaunay triangles and have to use *triangle*.

Something like this perhaps ? https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ There’s really not much to it. Personality to expand my skills, I do things like “advent of code”, while looking at what others have done.
Of all breaches into GMail, the ones which were done the most must be the ones from stolen phones. It makes absolutely no sense to require that you confirm anything from your phone as means of securing applications on your phone. And, you didn't work in the industry. I did. What you say about "business sense" is your opinion based on zero experience and apparent lack of insight... but you are strong in arguing your valuable opinion.
You press play. 
I suggest that you take a look at [spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/#). It's an emacs distro, which can be converted to a good IDE with auto complete. However, it'll take some time for you to get productive with it. 
I'm there at the moment. What's your areas of interest?
Automating the boring stuff is something you should absolutely focus on. You should make it a point to drive home the idea that if you're doing some repetitive transformation of your data (e.g. if an entry in column 2 is even, keep the row), you can automate it in a few seconds. Here's a [really good talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd8ulMb6_ls) from PyCon that you might want to borrow from. Webscraping is something you should mention as an idea. Something you might want to do to wow them is to write a script that will automate the importation of a large online database into a single CSV file. Then sort on some quality.
Django... And interest talk about Python in general that any developer should know. It sounds a little vague, know I think.
Dude, I was just getting ready to start a project for this purpose. Thanks!
I’m a scientist, numpy, scipy, and pandas DataFrame form the foundation of work I do in Python
I also suggest a focus on how python can interact with bash. While python can do everything there are bash tools that can make do things more easily (sed ask grep etc). Also look at using Jinja to automatic production of latex. I use this for automated tikz graphs and reports. 
I'll prob keep that for my group since we are the only ones using linux at the company. everyone else is stuck on win7.
I understand that exactly. That is actually the biggest point I'm probably going to hit on since our company has the messiest data
&gt;little to no So an older crowd? Personally I have some older guys in retirement range. When I try to show them something we will inevitably revisit it. And revisit it. Succinctly, it comes down they've gotten along this far without and don't care to learn. What they do learn is to call me when they need something automated.
This will be 24-45 year olds. Honestly, if they call me for help it is my job security and training for me for my next career change since I could use some leveling up in programming
Front end: Highly recommended this Design for non-designers Django: PostgreSQL indexing Taking Django Async Multi factor talks Fun: Security architecture from ancient times Django against the dark arts Operation Luigi That's all from the Friday.
I get it, but can your millennial group (&lt;36 yrs) crowd really have graduated STEM without programming? Even my sister who has a Master's in Social Work had to learn R. Maybe your guy's being a generation younger than mine might be interested, but those who can count the number of years on one hand, in my experience, are ZFG. Even if it comes from a department head.

Using system Python is a terrible idea. All of the packages you install will be wiped out each year when the new OS comes out. Just use Homebrew. 
Well done! Put it on github, so that other people can enjoy your work. And don't forget to have a nice [README.md](https://README.md) containing installation instraction, how to use it, maybe a demo video/gif, etc.
Python + ffmpeg binding + ffmpeg for compression ?
Mainly pandas... Any visualization suite is often good, but pandas would likely be the meat of what they need. Numpy obviously too
Pandas. Read csv. Do some processing, write csv. That is the basics that will make a scientist willing to learn more.
&gt;just starting to learn python(once again), what should I learn right way? Thnx. I will post there...
The older mechanical/aerospace engineers know Fortran. Some just never used it outside school, but all the R&amp;D ones did. You might be surprised at how much the older ones know.
FWIW, I have moved towards using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) nowadays to manage my python installations on macOS.. Makes it easy to have different versions available as well..
Very little to none. The Python foundation is ending support for Python 2 by 2020. I think pretty much every important or useful library and package supports Python 3.
What I use it for: 1. Automating control, switching and adc’s with single board computers ( gas switching to analysers etc) 2. Summarising timesteps of time series data from instruments with different sampling frequencies. Checking for error conditions in this data. 3. Counting things in images (cells, particles etc) Calling and being called by R? I like R graphics a lot more How are those suggestions?
MacOS is not alone in shipping python 2.x, many linux distros also. Of course, linux also ships with 3.x as well. It's not hard to install 3.x on MacOS. If you really want a surprise, try this at the terminal orompt: $ rsync --version $ bash --version and compare with the date of the latest releases.
Bokeh makes very pretty interactive graphs viewable in your web browser. Very nice alternative to matplotlib and is about the same difficulty level. Pandas is a must if you are still a company that uses Excel for everything. Try some GUI stuff as well.
Or the packages you install will break other software. On any system, leave the system Python alone. Only exception is Docker environments etc that have only a single use.
I think you are looking for heapq included in the standard library. 
In general, unless the data you care about is more than a quarter or so of the memory on your machine then you should just use CSVs (or JSON depending on the structure) and pandas. That'll give you enough room to load the raw data into pandas and do some transformations. Past that, you should look into using a database that can store it on disk and maybe do some caching. Once you get to a point where a single machine takes too long to do anything useful or you're working on a team then you should look into Hadoop and Spark. On my team at work we tend to just use HDFS and Spark (in Jupyter notebooks) for everything because we have the infrastructure already in place for the larger data sets (10s of terabytes), but most of the data is only on the order of gigabytes and doesn't really require distributed computing, or even something like a database on disk.
&gt; heapq - Heap queue algorithm https://docs.python.org/3.0/library/heapq.html
Interested in checking this out. I looked through your repos but couldn’t find it. Please post link that works :)
For scientists, the must is pandas for data handling, jupyter notebook is the editor/viewer, and matplotlib/seaborn/bokeh for data visualization. Other is varies by details of the job. Like if they have to export data frequently to exel then xlwings is extremely handy.
[SortedContainers](http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcontainers/), it's pure python, blazing fast, and very ubiquitous. I'd consider nearly on a numpy level of might-as-well-be-standard-library.
&gt; and I want to arbitrarily be able to, say, retrieve the 5 biggest elements Note that a balanced tree isn't necessarily the best choice for this either, in that it's doing more work than is needed - if this is all you need, a heap is often a better choice (and there is a module providing that, though not in a terribly OO fashion (ie. it just provides functions ensuring the invariants on top of a heapifiedlist, rather than exposing a seperate heap type). &gt; then I would have to sort the hash table's keys first, which would take O(nlogn) time To be honest, that's usually irrelevant. For pretty much all *practical* data, log N might as well be a constant - you'll often need pretty big lists before this is noticeable, or even exceeds the constant factor issues of a tree (after all, a billion items is still only a factor of 30 - you'll generally hit memory issues before you go much beyond that). This cuts both ways: for the same reason a tree's log n lookup time vs a hashtable's O(1) doesn't really matter: constant factors often tend to be more important in practice. The real issue is the one you mention next, where you're inserting and removing and then still need to iterate in sorted order. (Though again, this kind of priority queue usage is often a case where a heap may be better). But yeah, sometimes you really do need this, and a tree would be pretty useful to have on hand. As to why python doesn't provide one - I'm not actually sure. There are third party implementations, but those don't see a lot of use either, which may in fact be why - there just aren't enough times when neither a list, hashtable or heap is insufficient, making it more suited to being an external library rather than a core language element.
2.7 is still under supported long term release until 2020. And Python isn't filled with people who love to have their shit broken constantly like some other environments.
That‘s what I just used last week! As a beginner I thought that setting up gspread would be impossible but with this article it’s actually quite easy :)

I think, that if you ask the marketing department of IBM, they'd tell you "loud resounding yes". But, if you ask anyone who makes sense, they'd tell you that "cloud native" is just a marketing thing, that has more in common with the best washing powder in the world, than programming.

START WITH BEST PRACTICES! Seriously drill into them that the need to comment code and make it readable. If not for others who might need to look at their code but for themselves. When they have to come back and figure out what the hell they were doing in a month or two. That’s something a lot of people in astronomy struggle with and they eventually have to learn it the hard way. 
Teach them how to make API calls and deal with JSON data. This is a good general skill to know as it is relatively low on time investment but tremendously expands your toolkit size. (e.g. teach them pulling weather data from some endpoint) Regular expressions Programmatically navigating the file system tree, reading/writing from/to files, dealing with CSVs
By Taylor series, `e^x` can be express as `1 + x/1! + x^2/2! + ....` Now, the series can be re-written as `e^x = 1 + (x/1) (1 + (x/2)) (1 + x/3) (...) ))`, thus, you can compute a good exp aproximation in O(n) ​ def exp(x, N=10): sum = 1 for i in range(N-1, 0, -1): sum = 1 + x * sum/i return sum ​
They can still use gitbash etc
\- Machine Learning, or at least some basic multivariate statistical analysis and multiple regression (scikit-learn, numpy) \- Sympy for symbolic computation \- Pandas for data analysis \- FFT and other scientific computations using SciPy \- Sphinx project for documentation \- Cython for speeding up python code 
Thank you, I'll figure it out .
Wagtail exists and its very, very powerful, extensible and nice to use but it isn't as simple to use or work with as WordPress. It's built on Django and makes it a lot more friendly for many use cases. Once you have the site you want set up, it's incredibly easy to use and powerful with loads of features and functionality but getting the actual site up and running requires a decent amount of effort. It's a full blown CMS that let's you do anything you want, but it's not always as easy as a two click plugin install. If you just want a blog then Puput is really great. It's built on Wagtail and that means you can extend it if you want (with all the caveats that entails). WordPress is really good at being WordPress. There is a reason it's as loved and popular as it is. 
I've not looked too closely at the code or the SQL, so i'm not going to comment on it. However, I'd highly recommend building and running your own job queue in a production app (unless you have a very specific use case and know exactly what you're doing). Over time you'll end up re-building a lot of existing functionality that comes out of the box with existing task queues eg. better auditing, monitoring, retries, etc, etc. If you don't wanna use `celery` (which is _fantastic_ btw), there are other lightweight job queues like [rq](http://python-rq.org/) and [huey](https://github.com/coleifer/huey).
Seconding. Celery is awesome. That being said, there are situations where your own queue makes sense. For me, I wanted a queue that integrated with ecs tasks and celery made that wildly difficult so I wrote my own, works great. I'd recommend celery, especially since there are a ton of stuff already built on top. Celery with a redis backend is easy to setup
But that's not a balanced binary search tree. I think it is a minor weakness of Python to not have a builtin BBST, unlike Java and C++.
Thanks, was on mobile.
Scientist here. CSV isn't an appropriate format for scientific data that tends to be voluminous, even in less computationally intensive disciplines. The h5py interface to the HDF5 libs was the real game changer for me, being able to easily write processing scripts across terabytes of data without having to fiddle with HDF5 capricious interface will sound like a wet dream. CSV, not so much. Pandas is a nice one, though.
&gt; MacOS is not alone in shipping python 2.x, many linux distros also. Which ones? I am pretty sure all of the "big ones", e.g. Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, etc. are using Python 3 as the default Python interpreter.
Another scientist here ...IMHO CSV is fine if the data is less than say 100mb. It has the advantage of being human readable. I think it's a reasonable place to start.
I'm a newbie and I don't get it, someone explain? ;\_;

Try to show them how to use python in conjunction with their current weapon of choice. Processing Excel data for example 
Not "The Python foundation", the Python core development community.
This is the correct answer. &amp;#x200B; Scientists and Engineers with little to no programming experience (wtf, but ok) has no need for web scraping, API calls, face detection, making EXE files etc. What they DO need, in general, is how to read data, plot data and manipulate data. Showing them how easy it could be to read CSVs or FITS files or whatever their usual format is, looking at it with Pandas / Bokeh / MPL, fitting a model or some such and saving the results would probably get their attention. Show them software version control thereafter, most of them don't know it exists.
XUbuntu 18.04 still has python2 as default but python3 is installed. I see that Ubuntu 18.04 has just made 3 the default, but I don't run that, and I can't check if python2 is also installed. Note that I didn't say "python2 is the default python on many distros". MacOS has an aversion to some forms of software licence, but I'm unsure if this is why python3 is not installed. It apparently is the reason why rsync, git and bash on MacOS are very old.
i like this
Yes, I was about to suggest that. A lot of them will be using shit tools like excel to process their data. If they can get it out, you can teach them how much more powerful python is. 
There's a non profit that SPECIFICALLY has this mission https://software-carpentry.org/ Take a look through their talks and courses
I assume this: https://github.com/baruchel/tco ?? Don'know. :/
&gt; Note that I didn't say "python2 is the default python on many distros". Alright, I just assumed you meant "as default", since I believe *all* distributions still have Python 2.7 in the repos, and will probably have so for quite some time.
Not my experience at all. The guys nearing retirement all have experience with FORTRAN, we had no programming beyond excel VBA macros at university and nothing I see in degree programmes suggests this has changed recently
The issue is probably pagination considering the first page you linked to is showing 16 links. I’d probably start by googling common issues with “yield” in scrapy. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12847965/scrapy-parsing-items-that-are-paginated 
i think some simple database stuff would be useful to many. anything to condense hundreds of excel spreadsheets each with raw data that never get used a second time. if you. an show them a script that auto runs in a PC folder and cleans up and summarises datafiles, i think many will be very happy. 
Hey! I'm on the PyCharm team, let me try to help you out here. If I understand correctly, you have a server that runs a Docker daemon, and you want to be able to run an image on that server. In turn, you want to connect to a Python interpreter within that image. First, set up the Docker daemon to be accessible over the network. By default it listens on `/var/run/docker.sock`, and you'd like it to listen on a network socket instead. You do this by editing the 'hosts' key in `/etc/docker/daemon.json`. Use the box's IP on the interface you'll be connecting to, for example: 'tcp://10.0.5.15:2376'. And make sure to restart Docker so it starts listening on that socket. Then, in PyCharm, just go to Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | Docker, and connect to the Docker daemon on your server. At this point, you should be able to launch containers using PyCharm on the remote host. See the Docker tool window for details. I haven't done this before myself. So I'm not entirely sure what happens to published ports and how you'd need to connect to them. This will affect how things like debugging work. Let me know how things go and i'll do my best to help you out!
If the server is linux based, and ssh is not a deal breaker, install ssh and forward your X11 session to the server. If you are on a mac/windows machine you will need to install and start XQuartz/(XMing|VcXsrv), if you are on Linux and don't have an X server you will obviously need to install it. You can in theory do this without SSH, but that's a severe pain in the ass to set up.

Sorry for the delay. I think you are right. I did some basic tests and they seem to confirm what you're saying, but then I refactored some other part of the code in such a way that I didn't need to transfer so much data to the GPU in the first place, so I can do it all on one GPU now. Thanks anyway.
Is the joke that C# developers use Bing?
Based on the different colours, I was immediately thinking a multi-player pandemic-like game (the computer game, not the boardgame) could be pretty fun! 
To find C# you have to ... see sharp! (I'll let myself out)
Indeed, it's missing sources, method (and unit) of measurement, a lot of countries are missing data, and the presentation itself is lacking.
Thank you
So C# is BTFO or what?
What's wrong with a simple for loop?
It's Google trends, it says in the title.
I'm a scientists that started learning Python about a year ago and I just taught a course for a crowd very similar to yours. My course was designed as a "from complete beginner to being able to stand on your own and discard Origin/Excel for a lot of stuff". In total, there were 8 classes of 1 hour each, which happened in a week and a half. The topics were in separate Jupyter notebooks, and I taught the course directly in Jupyter notebooks (no interpreter). I covered: 1. Topics 1-6: Hello world, print, strings, data structures, conditionals, loops, loading modules, defining functions. This was seriously the most demanding part of the course. I refrained from showing people complicated come (at most a few lines at a time), or will think it's very complicated and shut down their minds. I only showed some cool plots they could do, but did not go into detail. One example was a log-log plot with several curves which need to be stacked one on top of the other, and where each curve is labeled with a text next to it. It's a nightmare to do that in Excel, but a breeze in Python. Do not show things at this point that are irrelevant to your public. Web scraping is cool, but will they really use it in their work? Depends greatly on your public. 2. Topics 7-11: Numpy basics, array computation, propagating uncertainties, doing symbolical calculation with sympy, pandas (90% read_csv and logical masks), matplotlib (simple plots, errorbar plots, imshow, color maps), and a few tools for fitting data (scipy.optimize.curve_fit and lmfit), regex (for cleaning/extracting data from badly formatted experimental data that come from the equipment), creating animations (I just saved several plots and then used ffmpeg for get them into a video), using Altair and seaborn as alternative methods of plotting. As an extra, I taught a little bit about how classes work, how they are defined and how to overload built in methods, how to create their own modules, creating virtual environments (especially if people have to deal with python2 and python3 in the same machine). In the end, I made a "certificate" svg and made a script that change the name on the svg file and converted it into png, and gave the script and the png file to them, as a parting gift, showing again how Python can make their lives easier. Anyway, that was how I structured my course. You seem to be going into a different direction, only showing them a few tools that can be useful for them. I agree with another comment that you should ask them what their problems are. I hope that you showing your students these tools you described convinces some of them to try programming. In my experience, people are very set on their methods and very few will try to learn, but a few is better than none.
Lol, where do you go to school. It sounds awful. 
Aside from the usual suspects, I'm going to pitch teaching Counter() to them. It takes like 5 minutes to learn, and it's such a powerful tool to have.
Because the dicts are nested (and presumably of arbitrary depth), a simple for loop wouldn't be able to iterate over all the entries. Op, you should look into algorithms for iterating over a tree depth first. Google should turn up many results. 
``` def remove_keys(souce_dict, remove_dict): result_dict = dict() for key, value in source_dict.items(): try: remove_value = remove_dict[key] if isinstance(key, dict) and isinstance(remove_value, dict): result_dict[key] = remove_keys(key, remove_value) elif remove_value is None or remove_value = value: continue else: result_dict[key] = key except IndexError: result_dict[key] = key ``` 
Or that Python devs use Google vs StackOverflow?
You don't know how many for loops you need to nest until you read the data. Of course if this is a fixed, predetermined structure, then you know in advance and can nest as many for loops as you need. But if it's a fixed, predetermined structure you wouldn't need a for loop at all
Just write recursive algorithm that does what you want. You can iterate over the dictionaries in sorted order if you use a `sorteddict`.

The great nations of the world seem to be split into two great camps: front end - back end - with 90% of the world’s wealth associated with back end
The top chemistry institute in Brazil. I think there is a big mental block with programming and similar stuff (90% don't even know what LaTeX is), especially coming from the older professors, who decide the curriculum, and several students. The number of times that I heard "I'm just not a computer person" and "of, this is too hard for me" is very very large. Didn't even try to learn. But in time I think this is going to change.
This seems correct, at a glance. It's unlikely based on the sample data, but OP should be aware that this won't work for data that is over 1000 levels deep
It’s since been updated to 2.7.15 The Twitter post is from June.
&gt;You don't know how many for loops you need to nest until you read the data. In that case, what's wrong with just looking at the data and figuring out how many are needed to nest? Unless this is production code, doing it in a quick-and-dirty way is perfectly acceptable.

Why does everyone go after Jupyter notebooks? Apart from the fact that it is free, Wolfram Mathematica is and will be the best notebook interfaced computational software one can use.

Or am I missing something that Jupyter notebooks have that Mathematica doesn't?

I think it's mainly due to worker-leadership transitions. It's complicated to have hierarchies of people not reflected by their age. Remote work could alleviate most of that problem.
It seems your problem here is the fact that your dict is arbirary deeply nested. The simplest option IMO is to flatten him to have tuple keys, then unflatten him in the end. def flatten_dict(dict_of_dicts): def recursive_routine(a_dict): for key, maybe_dict in a_dict.items(): if isinstance(maybe_dict, dict): for key_recursive, value in recursive_routine(maybe_dict): yield (key,) + key_recursive, value else: yield ((key,) , maybe_dict) return dict(recursive_routine(dict_of_dicts)) def unflatten_dict(dict_with_tuple_keys): final_dict = dict() for key_tuple, value in dict_with_tuple_keys.items(): temp_dict = final_dict temp_key = key_tuple while len(temp_key) &gt; 1: first_key = temp_key[0] if first_key not in temp_dict: temp_dict[first_key] = dict() temp_dict = temp_dict[first_key] temp_key = temp_key[1:] temp_dict[temp_key[0]] = value return final_dict so then you can do : flatten_dict_1, flatten_dict_2 = flatten_dict(dict_1), flatten_dict(dict_2) keys_to_remove = { key for key, value in flatten_dict_2.items() if key is None or flatten_dict_2[key] == flatten_dict_1.get(key) } flatten_dict_1 = { key, value for key, value in flatten_dict_1.items() if key not in keys_to_remove } dict_1 = unflatten_dict(flatten_dict_1) my code is not tip-top complexity, but as it seems it is handling config file it probably will not matter

Noted. However this is probably a failure point of the bot. The post had a question in it, and to help distinguish between learning questions and discussion driven questions (like this post) it uses the votes. In its next upgrade it will make a comparison to stack overflow posts and learnpython posts to help bolster its comparison, and there are a lot of posts about binary search trees in python that the bot would probably classify as sufficiently similar to this post. I point this out not because I'm not going to make a change, but because I want insight on what to change, what features to add and test cases to consider. I want the bot to do better, to the point of being perfect, but this post hit all the marks. Future speculative and rhetorical posts destroy the bot, and the bot operates on the assumption that those will rarely occur, and if they do, they're not likely to have low votes after it's built in delay. When these assumptions don't hold and the bot makes a false positive, please downvote it. It flags it for me and for the bot. [Good/Bad] bot is really inconsistent so I don't rely on that. Beyond that, the bot deserves downvotes when it makes a mistake. It doesn't delete it's comments because I feel like hiding from its mistakes is unethical and it deserves the downvotes. (Though I'm still torn between keeping the comment to own its mistakes, and deleting the comment to reduce clutter. I think owning the mistake is more important though, since it lets everyone, not just myself, see the bots success next to its failure, rather than reweighting it so the bot looks like it performs better.) Reviewing this post, the best performing features to classify with would probably be ngrams of "why" and "what if" questions vs "how do", "what is", "where is" "what did" and "what do" as well as a feature that considers the length of the "why" questions. However even then I'm not confident I'll be able to get a sizeable corpus to train with, and if I did, an accuracy above 60%. Do you have any insight or suggestions on features which would help a classifier distinguish between discussion driven questions and learning focused questions? And thank you for calling out the bot and pointing it out to me.
I'm 40+ and do a lot of remote work which I think helps with the age thing. Ideally, what matters is what you can do but seeing as how we're all human beings sometimes our biases creep in to what we do.

This may help you: https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#processpoolexecutor In the past weeks I have been using ThreadPoolExecutor with good success.

What are your GUI requirements? Do you have a sample screen you are trying to duplicate or eventually achieve? Qt may be a stretch if you have no Python experience at all. Can you break apart the computational stuff from your GUI or are they very tightly coupled? 
Funny, I'm into geodynamics. Small world. Just because CSV is widely used doesn't mean it's the best format. People should learn how to use proper structured formats like HDF5, it's always smaller, normalized, self-contained, and not affected by quantization issues related to the output format. Something CSV isn't, and that alone should tell you it shouldn't be used for scientific data ever if you care about the people handling you data in the future. I'm puzzled by your last point about using numpy rather than pandas with HDF5 data. Pandas datasets are wrappers around numpy offering nice abstractions to give meaning to your data and manipulate them. The IO format you ultimately use is completely irrelevant to the fact that you use these abstractions or not. I guess my main point is that we have to educate the scientific community about what file formats can do to make our life easier rather than falling back to faulty formats just because that's what people already do or that's what the device gives us.
You actually made a mistake, you should have filtered by category This trends search is based on all categories and this is the most searched Here is python search: 1 python swallows woman +2,550% 2 woman swalled by python +2,100% 3 python 3.7 +600% 4 javatpoint python +150% 5 download python 3.6 +130% This is even worst when you realize a lot of the top countries on the python search speaks English. &amp;#x200B; But if you change the category to Computers &amp; Electronics for example, almost everybody changes to red the US for example with that category goes to 22% python and 40% Java
Automanual testing?
This needs to be higher. Are we looking at search frequencies? Adoption rate? If so is it a corporate adoption, school or just any usage? What are the numbers polled? Where are the information coming from? So many questions.
The majority of new candidates looking for work on the open market are going to be young. Older candidates are much more likely to either already have a job they're happy with or to get their next job directly through people they know rather than on the open job market. So it really makes sense that the hiring market would be focused on the young. This probably *does* mean that there's a little bias against older candidates just because the hiring process isn't well calibrated for them, but I'm not sure there's any widespread belief that older programmers are any less valuable. I'm not sure there isn't for that matter, I'd just hesitate to draw any conclusions, and what you're observing is what I'd expect to see in either case.

Pretty sure he meant [this](https://www.kongregate.com/games/DarkRealmStudios/pandemic?acomplete=pandemic)
Thanks for the detailed description! Will try this approach. Howver, maybe I just misunderstood the docker feature in pycharm, but I though it implies building a docker image of the project files and starting container anew each time something is executed. On the other hand, I want more of an interactive workflow, e.g. first load some data into memory and then execute separate "cells" (which pycharm supports for python files). Also, it's not clear how file editing will work in this case. Will all the python files be located at the remote machine and thus accessible from different places, or on the local one? 
It is a matter of what tools you need for your job. Python and R are among the most popular programming languages in science for a number of reasons, the most popular reasons being that Python is easy to learn and can be applied to almost anything, and R is a statistical specialized tool and all scientist love their statistics. Also, the fact that both are free is quite relevant; not paying a license is not an small deal when you have to manage the fundings for your research project. Since Jupyter notebooks support two of the most popular programming languages (in science) it is not surprising everyone goes for it (I also heard that Julia is quickly catching up in popularity too).

I do get the feeling that the job market does cater to the young. All these jobs seem to want "recent college graduate rock star candidate with 5+ years experience, Masters degree preferred". The funny thing is that the best programmer I know doesn't really meet that description. I don't meet it either, but I get glowing reviews at work. There is a certain ageism in this field for sure.
You specified a page start_urls, and you scraped that page. You got all 16 urls on that page. You need to go to page 2 to get more urls. This means you also need to specify what page 2 and page 3 are. You may need to scrape the href off the next page button. 
Started running a Feed the Beast server for some friends but medium EC2 instances are expensive and I'm not around a lot so this way they can turn on and off the server by themselves saving me ~$30 a month 
Considering the huge variations even though you both used tech filters, it seems like these results aren't at all reliable; just play with the search settings till you get the results you want.
Thanks. My experience has been, for the vast majority of really good programmers, is they were self-taught because they literally love to code... and this is true for myself as well. 
But I mean why not just use the command line tool? aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0

Which country?
C# is mainly for games development and enterprise apps
If you don't want to scroll through all the memes and gifs: 1. Hidden state problems 2. People don't ship notebooks with requirements.txt, etc. 3. No testing/linting that's any good built-in 4. Very useless code completion (have to run the cell first, etc.) 5. Can't take advantage of type hints 6. Several other things It's actually a pretty good list of issues, many of which I've experienced but just ignored because I value what notebooks do for me over their hurdles. You will have to deal with overdone memes to get to the good examples of the issues. 
Well the slides weren't originally meant for consumption by whiny redditors. They supplemented the talk, which was fantastic.

Of course they supplement the talk. But this post only links to the slits, which is why I'm commenting on the slides alone.
Thank you!
Awkward I just started my Intro to c++ today lol..
What if it's different for different files?
I think Ubuntu 18.04 and the last few Fedora releases ship with Python 3 by default. /usr/bin/python is however still Python 2. As I understand it, Arch changed /usr/bin/python to Python 3 some time ago and the Python community reacted with a PEP that said that /usr/bin/python{,2} should be Python 2 while Python 3 should live as /usr/bin/python3.
Fair enough, though I don't think you can fault me for viewing your post as a comment on the author of the slides as well.
The Twitter post is still accurate and relevant. Not sure how you came to the conclusion that they ship 2.7.15.. ;)
I agree, my lab used to do this BY HAND for hundreds of data points for 30-50 participants. 
Oh all those things OP mentiomed above can be done automated in excel as well. 
Antarctica, my native homeland.
Where is C and C++ 😭😭😭
If your connection is slow/unstable, for the work you are doing, you have bigger problems than displaying plots.
Apologize, I was referrring to this hackernews thread where author of the tweet said it was resolved. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17841101 He has another comment in the thread later stating that he was wrong.
For now I use jupyter, and the main issues are very poor autocomplete/navigation functions, compared to a regular ide. The connection stability doesn't affect code execution and showing results, including plots.
rereading this whole comment train a month later made me upset because the ignorance here is just beaming! Gusutabo is the only one here who's brain does math apparently.
HOW DARE THEY! There are tens of people living there! (actually it looks like a thousand!)
&gt; However, I'd highly recommend building and running your own job queue in a production app recommend against it I assume? 
Well this image still is not very helpful, right? What you suggest would be like writing a research paper, and in the results only give some random numbers and saying "You can see for yourself on Google Scholar"...
Looks like you're missing some stuff where you define the second query (copy paste error) 
Trying to build my flask app. Being following the flask-restful documentation but it doesn't cover everything. &amp;#x200B; Can anyone recommend a sample project? Particularly looking for a project that queries database directly using sql scripts rather that libraries like SQLAlchemy. &amp;#x200B; Any Suggestion will be appreciated.
In addition to everything above, you might look into an architecture that includes RabbitMQ as a messaging queue or even Kafka Streams or something like that as a means of continuously processing any tweets you pull down. That way you could split them up into separate thread pools if you needed to start scaling up to different servers.
I found it awful for beginners in the programming world, now for C.C, it is quite useful. I just wanted to learn how to program, and not use everything from python to work with math, but today I plan to have a solid base of computation and maybe it will be useful someday.
I think these are all valid reasons to not like them, but I think they are worth it; especially if you know about these problems ahead of time. One thing I love about notebooks is using them as an all-in-one archival mechanism. I may do an analysis and want to have the main code saved along with the resulting plots. I can do that with the notebooks (though I usually export to HTML so that I can't accidentally clear it). Usually they do still rely on only codes so I have my own tool that uses `inspect` with some other tools to print versions and, if applicable, git commit information, for every module. Now, that is stored alongside my results!
The nesting depth is not really predictable in my case. Also Dict1 and Dict2 could have diffetent depths as well.
Agree. And for this kind of tools (google trend), the less you alter the search, the better. Going into specifics, subcategories, etc. doesn't really bring accuracy or better representation. Regarding other stats, data, etc. you can also check [another](https://twitter.com/joinindorse/status/1034064521307070465) nice little visualisation we found (they used stack overflow data). Please do share other sources or data if you have the patience! I'd love to take a look [salgat](https://www.reddit.com/user/salgat) and [vocalcsharp](https://www.reddit.com/user/vocalcsharp). Thanks!
Thanks!

So, you can use the conda navigator or the conda prompt to install the package you need. If you use pip, the installed package will be available in another environment, not the anaconda environment. In the conda prompt you can run the command `conda install schedule ccxt` and then the package and it's dependencies will be installed. Any doubts feel free to ask
I am learning python3, I need some tipes , please.

SortedContainers seems pretty well tested and runs fast. Wouldn’t that make it a solid choice for inclusion in the standard library?
 Just yesterday I was mentoring some python beginners who were starting out with JupyterLabs. I agree with most of the issues mentioned. For me, the main issue with notebooks is that it adds a layer which obscures some of the essential concepts of programming: What is "code"? Where does it live? How do I execute code? How to install packages? I find myself recommending a text editor + command line. Notebooks are powerful, yes, but something can be said for mastering the screwdriver before diving into power tools.
Then he's made of wood
None of our geology, geophysics, or GIS software understands HDF5, unless I wrote it. As an interchange format I really like it, but it is only useful if people can actually load the data. And as it stands, except for the python data science folks, it cannot be used reliably. For example, I have a data logging device that records a full waveform signal (an audio file, for practical purposes). Because it is android, I pretty much have to use java, unless I want to jump through a ton of hoops. There is no way to write to HDF5 files in pure java (they all require external C dependencies). Which makes it a real pain to code, test, distribute. So I elected to store my data as binary arrays in files that can be memmapped in numpy instead. I can write those files easily in java, and read them easily in python. HDF5 would have been perfect, if libraries existed that suited my task. As a small R&amp;D department, we can't devote weeks of developer time to roll our own HDF writer library in pure java, nor do we want to focus time and energy into fighting the android development environment to force the existing stack to play nice. So, like pretty much every time we consider HDF5, it ends up not being used. Which is a pity, cause I love the format :)
Yeah, Queues are such a good way of scaling-up an application - I structure most things around using one now (RabbitMQ is very good, it's my go-to queue system). I used to do a lot of work on account analysis, business reports, that sort of thing. Implementing a queue system made such a huge difference as we could distribute the work easily, prioritise certain types of job, all while keeping the UI zippy for the end-user.
Great slide. Urges me to stop using notebooks, esp for the sake of [autocomplete](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7aEiVwBAdk&amp;t=83). Grandma is the editor, Jupyter is the mono-color.
Sorry I don't know any other page that does this properly, &amp;#x200B; but on what you said about not altering the search I wonder if that would be the best case &amp;#x200B; With something like Java, google will find a lot of pages related to Minecraft that are not really programming searches, so even if you add all the filtering this will still affect your data, but then if you don't filter any of that, you get a a huge amount of non related searches, a lot of people download/update Java just so apps will run on their computer or because they want to play a game. &amp;#x200B; So in both cases, not altering or altering the search you end up with a lot of bad data. &amp;#x200B; Unfortunately I don't think it's possible to get a reliable result for something like this on Google trends. &amp;#x200B; Also I like that link you just shared, too bad It didn't separate by region but still cool to see. I wish PHP would go down more... jk
I’m half way through, it’s very good but your in for a long read!
I think the book's introduction saying something about it being the equivalent to a complete college class on it, not too sure.
Recursive function that diggs deeper if the value in the past dict is also a dict with exit condition if it's not a dict?
Have you tried GitHub's search function? It allows you to search to "topics" (e.g. \`flask\`, \`flask-restful\`). &amp;#x200B; [example search](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aflask+topic%3Aflask-restful)
If I were writing the guidelines they would be something along the lines of: * Useful * Documented * Good test suite * Fast (enough) * Stable SortedContainers seems to fit the bill, so in my highly inexpert opinion seems like a good choice. Maybe requests too.
Check https://github.com/openstack/stevedore it is a bit similar lib.
That's one way, for sure. That's what the other poster did
One thing I like about this solution is that you're not iterating over the dictionary while also removing things from it, which can cause issues
I'm not sure if you will get to the point and it is likely overkill right now, but learning how to distribute to multiple servers etc. is nice. For a python forum I would probably choose luigi (made by spotify). Another option common on university HPC clusters is SLURM (originally designed for an academic scientific compute cluster). It is fairly popular in scientific compute especially bioinformatics which is what I do. I wouldn't pick it for what you are doing unless you have a SLURM cluster already available. If you are at a university you might want to find out what kind of cluster is available and what it runs on. There are a whole host of other workflow/distribution managers out there and many of them would work on a single machine and allow you scale up later if a cluster becomes available.
How dare someone say they dislike pollution while breathing polluted air, am I right? 
The term Zac used to describe writing unit and integration tests yourself instead of code generating the tests. He works on the library hypothesis. Which is property based testing.

If MSOffice, ArcGIS, Chrome, and Python's standard libs can load HDF5, then I'll agree. Until then, trying to educate people is like screaming into the void.

You can do it in python using automation library. You can use pyautoguy easily but it’s just automation. You can use selenium for a more optimized solution, but I think it takes more time and skill to set it up.

Contribute to a mid-sized/major python data analystics open source package. Then you can show that you understand it, and can improve upon it. even something "not very interesting" like adding documentation, examples, cleaning up code should help to build a "contributions" section in your resume.
Given on how many bug releases there were for Python 2.7 (and their backwards incompatibility changes), which Python 2.7? Also, I mean backwards compatible, not forwards compatible, which is what people usually say when they say backwards compatible. Python 2.7.6 is forwards compatible with Python 2.7.7 in that the Python 2.7.6 code will work well with Python 2.7.7. Python 2.7.7 code doesn't play nearly as nicely with Python 2.7.6.

Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**.

This post would be better suited in r/learnpython and /r/learnprogramming 
1) unpack your problem in single units and start working on a single unit at a time, eventually correcting yourself to join the parts more efficiently. 2) look which python data types would help you, lists? Dictionaries? Defining a class? 3) write different functions for each different task, like, register, remove, or update the status of a customer and use conditional statements to comply to the exercise rules. 4) I am truly sorry if you are fucked, but being your problem so simple, there might be reasons for it. Perhaps you didn’t follow your class? You _are_ not qualified for the test you’ve taken? Your problem is not with python, it just seems like you don’t have a clue of what a program is. No tutorial will help with that, only attending lectures or lots of reading can
I had a similar conversation with Fernando a few weeks ago at Neuroinformatics. There isn't much that can be done about the issues with hidden state, however there are things that can be done on the technical side to help with the requirements.txt issues. The idea is to have a little piece of code that make it possible to bootstrap requirements from the source code at runtime (or even just statically would be a good start) so that there are a minimal number of steps needed to go from a notebook to something like a git repo that can feed Binder. My ideal endgame would be even simpler, which is to embed that runtime module/package information in the notebooks themselves as environment metadata.

CEF Python is a C++ extension written in Cython and should work fine with any Python 2.7 version. I think that Python extensions in general are compatible with all Python versions within a minor version, so a micro version doesn't matter.

Isn’t Google banned in China? This isn’t useful data for that country 
&gt; Of all breaches into GMail, the ones which were done the most must be the ones from stolen phones. How many of those were app based 2fa? And...by whose word? Yours? &gt; It makes absolutely no sense to require that you confirm anything from your phone as means of securing applications on your phone. Except the phone is treated as a device that is exempt and it is under the reasonable assumption that it has it's own security measures to open, as in, a lock screen password/fingerprint &gt; And, you didn't work in the industry. I did. I don't give a fuck. You can work in the industry of car dealerships for 30 years. It doesn't let you claim how and why the car manufacturer made their car.

You will automatically learn general programming from Python. I wouldn’t recommend trying to learn CS or algorithms to start out. That might discourage you from actually learning to program. I think you’d find the most benefit in getting started right away. There’s a ton of courses, both free and paid. I’ll recommend one of each, and this isn’t to say they’re the best out there: [Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners](https://youtu.be/rfscVS0vtbw) [Real Python](https://realpython.com/products/real-python-course/) 
Could be that C# devs use Bing. But my previous comment was suggesting that a search directly on the SO site might not register in Google Trends. 
&gt; The 2FA should be on a separate device. This a basic principle of security. ...because you said so? &gt; For example what happens when you login to a site from your phone and your 2FA is an app on the same phone? Well normally you'd have a layer of protection on your phone. &gt; Or someone forces you login? Forces? Like, gun to the head? Damn man, I think I have much more pressing matters to deal with at that point.

Might want to look into KonsolePart and VTE.
I have no idea if I'm right, but FWIW, my prior would be that email handling and writing WAV files would both be a more common problem.
here's one possible way... `a = ('12', 'a15', '18', '21', '24')` `c = 0` `for b in a:` `if b.isdecimal():` `c += int(b)`
My thought exactly. It's missing a dimension, breakdown of programming language by region and... 
Well it's Google trends... Op clearly doesn't mention the other measured dimension so who knows. If I had to guess it would be most searched... But without that all important other dimension who knows

I would add 3. they're not developer friendly (no auto-complete, no labeling cell as modified, git diffs are awful).
How do you implement all the protocols and stuff, meaning all the lower level HTTP request response parts etc? Looking forward to seeing and hopefully learning from the code!
I can’t imagine omitting database migrations/seeds to be helpful in the long run unless you have another proven method for setting up data and keeping it consistent. Also you mention not installing “100 packages” just to setup you framework. Would this mean that I couldn’t choose to have packages hook/plugin in to my framework? How would third party vendors/individuals ship their code efficiently? Sounds like you have awesome intentions and I’d be very interested to see what you come up with!

By default I meant that only Python 3 is available on a fresh install. I.e., all system tools and "core" packages use Python 3. `/usr/bin/python` should always point to `python2`.
Excellent write-up. The section on implementing custom hashable classes is particularly useful: it is easy to forget `__hash__` and `__eq__` must work together.
I would love to see it improved, but calling it not-useful at all is a bit too much IMO. It autocompletes variable names even if the cell has not yet been run, and function help can be accessed by `Shift + Tab`. The latter unfortunately only works on already defined functions. 
Depending on how many twitter accounts you're going to stream into python, you will definitely need a queuing system as stated in other comments. If you're going to pull a large amount of tweets, you might not want to write to file first. This can cause issues with tweets coming in faster than your disk can write. To solve this, you can use an in memory database like Redis to queue tweets for writing and long term storage without writing to disk first. You're only issue with in memory databases/queuing is that you have to have as much memory dedicated to the process as you expect your data set to be. This can be a bit hard to estimate for a queue, as you may have situations where you're data saturation rate is in the 0%-1% range for days or weeks at a time, and then one account you're tracking goes insane and eat's your whole memory pool up. Not to mention if a downstream process breaks and the queue backs up, you have a potential for data loss. In enterprise environments, redundancy is key, so scaling is not only about increasing the speed at which you can handle these tweets, it's about how fast you can detect a problem, and solve it. For this, you're going to want to monitor all parts of your data stream, from intake, to queuing, to distribution to worker processes, to output. Handling the errors that can occur at these areas correctly will set you apart in the end, and is really the hardest part of designing a really solid, scaleable solution. Some of what you need is not going to be python specific, especially monitoring, as you don't want python monitoring itself in case. Once you're at a good place with the python, look at stackoverflow and find things like [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13069634/python-daemon-and-systemd-service) on how to make your python scripts run as a service with systemd, this is generally what you'd do in a professional environment. Break out your processes into services and let Linux do the management based on your systemd file. Then all you need to do is monitor the services with whatever service monitor you want. Obviously not everything in my text wall will apply if you're not going for a gigantic rollout, but remember, if it's worth doing, it's worth overdoing, and anyone that says otherwise is usually a project manager. Have fun, and good luck with the project!
I agree with a lot of what the slides present about shortcomings of notebooks. However, it is also important to understand that they are a great tool for specific contexts, in the same way that they may not be the best tool for other applications. In the case of scientific work, where you have to share results, plots, etc. Notebooks make it incredibly easy to prepare a document with markdown, etc. embedded plots **and** the possibility of the recipient inspecting and changing the parameters of a fit, etc. I do see in notebooks and interactive plot libraries such as Bokeh the future in scientific publishing, where the reader gets the ability of explore the data, not just see a plot. Notebooks also make it super easy to prototype solutions, in which you need to alter the order of execution of some cells to test behavior, etc. But I do agree. If you are *learning Python*, using notebooks to deliver production code, etc. it may just not be the proper tool. As an inspiration, you can see for example what the guys at [trackpy](https://soft-matter.github.io/trackpy/v0.3.2/tutorial/walkthrough.html) did for showing how their library works in step-by-step tutorials written using notebooks. I think that use case is a great example of the power of Jupyter.
Okay i'll bite. ML, DL, NN = ?
Since you can easily scale to dozens of instances with kubernetes, is gunicorn usefull too ? What about having only flask handling single connection ?
Russia is front-end nation =) 
&gt;I can’t imagine omitting database migrations/seeds to be helpful in the long run unless you have another proven method for setting up data and keeping it consistent Surely the database will be a NoSQL database. I will use RethinkDB, because it can fire events when a table changes, so I have the possibility to share the events across multiple instances of one draper application. The migration plan looks like following: Adding stuff is easy, just write the models in your code with the fields, start the application and use them. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &gt;Also you mention not installing “100 packages” just to setup you framework. Would this mean that I couldn’t choose to have packages hook/plugin in to my framework? How would third party vendors/individuals ship their code efficiently? &gt; &gt;Also, how do API views and controllers differ? Are API views a specifically structured JSON response type? Are API controller views? Maybe the default MVC pattern with a JSON response trait (that’s a PHP term, not sure what they’re called in python) that exists in all controllers might be helpful. &gt; &gt;Once you get past the basic MVC functionality (tasks, etc) it might be helpful to break things up based on their domain (DDD) where each domain gets a plugin/module/component with a consistent folder/file structure. Many frameworks do this, Django and Magento 2 are two that come to mind quickly. This would be a good standard structure to allow other third party vendors (as previously) mentioned to auto load their packages into. &gt; &gt;These are just norms that I’ve come across and think of right off the bat. I’ve been wanting to build my own framework as well just to become more familiar with all of these concepts. Sounds like you have awesome intentions and I’d be very interested to see what you come up with! &gt; &gt;A colleague of mine turned me on to this, I found it very helpful and eye opening for base concepts of how a framework should run in a very basic procedural sense. It covers dependency injection, routing, error handling, etc. it’s in PHP but all of the concepts will obviously remain the same. One of the large concepts it’s missing is a Model/DB. But FWIW you might find it helpful. &gt; &gt;https://github.com/PatrickLouys/no-framework-tutorial &gt; &gt;Cheers! &amp;#x200B;
bounding your framework to the specific database is a pretty much deadend.
&gt; How many of those were app based 2fa? And...by whose word? Yours? Nope, that's a reputable CS journal: https://www.scmagazine.com/lost-devices-leading-cause-of-data-breaches-report/article/530198/ Considering that at the time of publication of this article, 2fa was mandatory, I'd say 100%. &gt; It doesn't let you claim What lets you claim? You seem to have no knowledge of the subject matter whatsoever.

You need to use nginx on top of your cluster. Nginx can easily handle tens of thousands request. Python can't. By default, gunicorn blocks all incoming connections until it will process current request. So, if you have one very slow client which loads your page for 3 seconds, gunicorn will be blocked by it. When you use nginx it reads and caches all requests before sending it to gunicorn. 
I've only read a single article and am already smitten! Thanks! 
&gt; Without any migrations stuff like in Django and no database handling like in Flask. Without db handling, it will be a pretty useless Web framework.

It's not likely that simply trying to use a module would break the library - have you changed anything else recently? Could you show your code? And elaborate on what "the python ide" is?
I still love notebooks for everything that they are good for. But yes, after initial explorations and tests I usually write my code in Pycharm and reimport it back into the notebook (where I do more analysis and plotting etc). Actual coding is of course better in a proper IDE, but just having your workflow and exploration archived in a nice notebook with the plots and tables and the table of contents on the side is just perfect for my work.
Here's my python code: [https://imgur.com/a/HXvQR4e](https://imgur.com/a/HXvQR4e) Also I made a new discovery that the problem seems to only occur if I try and run a python file that imports urllib. Once I have done so, any python file I try and run in that same terminal window, it gives me the same outputted error of urllib. Here is the error:
You didn't post the error.
I do use more than one database. In real world applications, you pick the one that fits best for your data. One service could potentially use more than one persistence engine. An example is that you want to use NoSQL as an event store and in addition to that you would also like to have a SQL database for transactional operations. In addition to that in world of micro services you would try to use same tools as long as it's possible. Even thou micro services allow you to do whatever you want on every single service, but again in the real world one team owns more than one service so it makes sense for the team to have same tools and approaches used in every service they own (as long as it's makes sense), to make them as much productive as possible. With that in mind I would prefer my team to use good old Flask with different databases on every service, rather than a new framework per service just because of the database.

You could use `zip` to get a list of pairs from two lists and pandas dataframe attributes to get the two lists: ``` df = pd.DataFrame({'col1': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'col2': [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]}) for pair in zip(df.col1, df.col2): print('%d-%d' % pair) ```
&gt;df = pd.DataFrame({'col1': \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5\], 'col2': \[3, 4, 5, 6, 7\]}) for pair in zip(df.col1, df.col2): print('%d-%d' % pair) zip? Python has so many code... where can I start to learn its vocabulary? Thank you by the way for the answer!
Is this pandas?
[removed]
You could also use pandas integrated [apply function](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.apply.html). df = pd.DataFrame({'col1': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'col2': [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]}) df.apply(lambda x: f"{x.col1}-{x.col2}", axis=1) What we are doing here is we `apply` a function on an axis of the dataframe, in other words we are iterating through each row of the dataframe. `lambda x:` is defining the function on a parameter `x` for which we use an [f-string](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/) to create our desired output, analogous to writing `"{}-{}".format(x.col1, x.col2`. By specifying `axis=1` we are saying to apply to function by row, not by column. With this you can easily create a new column in the dataframe.

A quick search of Draper on github shows some similarly named projects. Also, Draper is active [on github](https://github.com/draperlaboratory).
For larger clusters with a number of services, I would keep the upstream config out of the ingress. 1. Nginx Ingress + Upstream Config =&gt; Gunicorn (for small clusters) 1. Nginx Ingress =&gt; Nginx Server + Upstream Config =&gt; Gunicorn (for large clusters) Check out: 1. https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/issues/257 1. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49426772/nginx-server-behind-nginx-ingress-controller 
I use postgres and cocroachDB via SQLAlchemy + Alembic in flask or Django and postgres. So by hardcoding one specific nosql database you are limiting your project audience severely. The key to Flask or Django is their customization and configuration options.
Awesome.. There are already exists a github repository with whole this ideas? In issues's format to discuss them.. &amp;#x200B;
Lol you want people to submit their private keys to you?
yes. some sites like bitmex allow for private keys that only enable trading, not withdrawals.
Is it the recommended way if the app is containerized in a management system like Kubernetes that has ingress control too? That's where I wasn't sure
I think this is not a problem
This is great info. Thank you jsaundersdev!
Ill definitely check out Rabbit MQ. Thank you for the suggestions jasonlesshodges.
I kind of had the same question. I assume you can just use Flask particularly if you assign your Kubernetes pods to very small CPU units where it isn't doing more than one worker at a time anyway. I had thought from reading that Gunicorn manages queues better than Flask so even in Kubernetes I assumed it would be more graceful if there are high requests and the app has some latency. I'm new to this though.. 
This is awesome! Thanks a ton. 
Is this also the case if load balancing is managed at ingress of Kubernetes that contains the Gunicorn+app?
See above reply
Nice article. Only criticism is using "var1", "var2" over and over again with similar names. In the future, it might be useful to have them as something else like "dict1" or "key1"
I once made something like this in MMF :D
Why would I subscribe for something I can get for free without registering ? &amp;#x200B; Just google "best python libraries" and you will find that always the same 20 something libraries get listed.
You could check if there is a community college nearby offering courses. It can help to learn alongside others and have the structure provided for you. There are also many links in the sidebar of this subreddit you can use to get started. It depends on how you learn best. There is no one-size-fits-all. I've never used Youtube to learn code. I prefer blog posts, stack overflow, documentation, or books. These are easier to copy from and I can go at my own pace. The best way to learn, in my opinion, is to make something for yourself and grow it. It could be a spreadsheet, a web page, a python script, whatever. Python is a good language to learn, and something like Flask is pretty accessible. Maybe start there. Good luck!
You don't need to package your script as an executable if you just want to run it on your own machine. You can create a shortcut that runs it in a terminal window. [ Here's a little information about running Python from the CLI.](https://www.pythoncentral.io/execute-python-script-file-shell/)
uwsgi provides support for efficient handling of static files (https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/StaticFiles.html), gunicorn doesn't.
I use reqman : https://github.com/manatlan/reqman it let you write easily your calls in yaml files, and test them against your api
What do you think about create a organization to this project and to separate it in parts ( cli , orm, framework ) as such as Laravel , where it give cli called "artisan" to create controllers, models using cli... Will be a great way to organize it.
&gt;My goal is to become a software engineer within a year Check your local job market - if there's only 1 (if any at all) python dev job per 10 of the jobs I've noted below... Python is great, but the only opportunities in my area are data science, which will typically require a degree + python (at least where I am) JavaScript + HTML + CSS + some random frameworks or Java or C# + some backend framework experience and some basic front-end knowledge are far more marketable here, and I'd assume most places. I'm not trying to make python sound like a bad language or choice, its just the reality unless you live in certain areas or can somehow find remote work.
Let's start simple. :) 
i just impress with your awesome collection of python libraries. thank you so mush for sharing these.
Try https://taverntesting.github.io 
in python, **requests** library you can use , below code might help you : `import requests #import requests library` `#making GET request` `resp = requests.get('http://api.example.com/')` `print(resp.json())` `#making POST request` `payload = {'name': 'Example'}` `resp = requests.post('http://api.example.com/', json=payload)` `print(resp.json())`
Let's take a look on the dis: ``` dis.dis(simpleFunction) # 6 0 LOAD_GLOBAL 0 (print) # 2 LOAD_CONST 1 ('hello world') # 4 CALL_FUNCTION 1 # 6 POP_TOP # 7 8 LOAD_GLOBAL 1 (sys) # 10 LOAD_ATTR 2 (exit) # 12 CALL_FUNCTION 0 # 14 POP_TOP # 8 16 LOAD_GLOBAL 0 (print) # 18 LOAD_CONST 2 ('hello reddit') # 20 CALL_FUNCTION 1 # 22 POP_TOP # 24 LOAD_CONST 0 (None) # 26 RETURN_VALUE ``` we need to remove lines 6 and 7 to get `print("hello reddit")` executed. `simpleFunction` byte code: ``` simpleFunction.__code__.co_code #b't\x00d\x01\x83\x01\x01\x00t\x01j\x02\x83\x00\x01\x00t\x00d\x02\x83\x01\x01\x00d\x00S\x00' ``` You can map opcodes with bytes with: ``` dis.opmap['LOAD_GLOBAL'].to_bytes(1, byteorder='little') ``` Basically, we need to remove first 16 bytes (4 opcodes + 4 opcode arguments per 2 lines), so the desired bytecode is: ``` b't\x00d\x02\x83\x01\x01\x00d\x00S\x00' ``` You can't modify `simpleFunction.__code__.co_code` directly, but you can recreate the whole `simpleFunction.__code__`, let's define a new function for this purpose: ``` from types import CodeType def patch_function(func, payload): fn_code = func.__code__ func.__code__ = CodeType( fn_code.co_argcount, fn_code.co_kwonlyargcount, fn_code.co_nlocals, fn_code.co_stacksize, fn_code.co_flags, payload, fn_code.co_consts, fn_code.co_names, fn_code.co_varnames, fn_code.co_filename, fn_code.co_name, fn_code.co_firstlineno, fn_code.co_lnotab, fn_code.co_freevars, fn_code.co_cellvars, ) ``` now patch the original function: ``` co_code = b't\x00d\x02\x83\x01\x01\x00d\x00S\x00' patch_function(simpleFunction, co_code) simpleFunction() # hello reddit ``` Hope it makes sense.

Thanks for your valuable comment.
Well what you subscribe is basically for two things - to read about those 21 libraries (not 20) and then having access to a host of all the other articles that are already there on that website. What's the harm anyway buddy? Registration is all it takes, not even a penny. And you never know, what's in store for you right?
Thanks
Pandas is incredibly easy to use. Try being more specific in your queries rather than reading bits and pieces of documentation.
he means exchange API keys
Thanks for this list!
Is your .py file that you wrote your code in named after a module? Import xxx can also be used to open python scripts in the same directory, and your import command might be importing the wrong file.
For datetime libraries there are definite tradeoffs with arrow, you can see a benchmark of common python datetime libraries [here](https://aboutsimon.com/blog/2016/08/04/datetime-vs-Arrow-vs-Pendulum-vs-Delorean-vs-udatetime.html). You can also see alternative benchmarks and reasons to use pendulum over arrow at [pendulum's website](https://pendulum.eustace.io/faq/). Basically pendulum has more consistent behaviour. Thanks for the list!

Post questions to /r/learnpython
Do codeacademy I’m going into yr11 to do the nea test. Once u can do like 70% of codeacademy it’s calm. The test doesn’t account for anything anyway. 
Here is a good book to read. https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ 
That's the question... what about a general purpose web application seems like a good fit for NoSQL?
Less known? 
I recommend you use kivy https://kivy.org/#home or beeware https://pybee.org
A good rule of thumb to follow for a framework is convention over configuration. It’s best to guide your users into a convention norm rather than force them into a configuration or over configuring things themselves. As many others have pointed out, as soon as you assume a preference for others (you assume NoSql) you lose potential users because that may not be the best database choice for their project. NoSql is great in certain circumstances but lousy in others, it all depends on if it is the correct choice for your application. But that should be an application decision, not a framework decision. Hope this helps. Rails &amp; Laravel both have a nice DB setup IMHO but I believe many people gripe about active record vs data mapping. Have fun trying to please everyone /s

Can you develop on a local VM?
Wow Reddit really hates indenting. 
Unfortunately, all my VMs are hosted in remote datacenters. I do consulting, thus various projects have dev boxes scattered all over the place.. 
Sounds like a fun project, might be a market for something like this. However, unless (and even if) you are doing this completely transparent/open source you will potentially face legal liability. You are basically describing a broker firm, providing financial services ("as a service"). Anyway, as you are posting at r/Python, I reckon you are asking for technical direction, not legal or business advice so I'll give just a little pinch of that. Some stuff to look into would be How to run a web service (perhaps using frameworks such as Django or Flask) How to setup subscriptions/user handling/payments etc How to couple your backend (the bot system) with your frontend (the web service) - you might want to keep things separate, I know I would, maybe look into compartmentalization, there are some resources on how exchanges do this (wallets vs frontend) Security, security, security - You need a metric fuckton of failsafes - If you become popular, people WILL try to break your system / game your system

&gt;Good suggestion. Most of what is here is straight from the Readme, but I added the installation and features information. Updated on GitHub, PyPI will get it with the next release. &amp;#x200B;
&gt;Can you checkout the code onto your laptop to resolve the conflicts locally. I am quite opened to do it, just to trying to understand how.. If I understand you correctly, there will be 3 repos (linux box, Bitbucket, Windows dev station), so basically, everytime I need to merge, I would: 1) push from linux to Bitbucket 2) pull from Bitbucket to Windows 3) Merge 4) push from windows to Bitbucket 5) pull from bitbucket to linux 6) test the merged code.. &amp;#x200B; Am I understanding this correct? &amp;#x200B;
How often will you be making the request? How is the relative `$time` related to `$start` and $end, specifically: Is `$start` and `$end` a function of `$time`? &amp;#x200B; I would use a bash script for something like this, executed by a cron job, but since this is r/Python, perhaps a Python script is more suiting, using the [Request library](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) 
I agree strongly with you about LabVIEW. It is damn good for a certain band of use cases. What did you mean when you said MATALB has important non-GUI components that Python doesn't? Could you please explain that. I am going to switch among LabVIEW/ Python/ MATALB(maybe) depending on requirements and use-cases like you said. That is the best advise.

I've been working on some pull requests for `attrs`. I have a couple of patchsets that allow you to do the following: @attr.s(frozen=True, singleton=True) class C(object): x = attr.ib(default=3) a = C() b = C() a is b # True c = C(4) a is c # False Basically, I have abused the Singleton pattern. I think it might even get merged.
Maybe you could use a different worklow to adress this case &amp;#x200B; You could clone the repo locally on windows, directly from you linux box (via ssh) If you have merge, i guess you use feature branches. In such a case: 1- commit your linux branches before merge 2- pull these branches on windows 3- merge or rebase them on windows 4- push branches on the remote linux 5- merge or rebase on linux (fast forward) 6- push on origin (bitbucket) from linux when you want to publish &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; You could also use a similar workflow with bitbucket as a classical centralised workflow &amp;#x200B; Another simplier solution: * Develop only you local windows. * Push to bitbucket * pull to linux and test &amp;#x200B; Git is a DVCS. It's its strenght !!!! &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
One option is to create a 3 repository chain: * Bitbucket repo * Linux machine repo * Windows machine repo In this way you can `git pull` everything from your linux machine onto the windows box, do all the merging there, and push the results back to the Linux box for testing. Then, if it looks good, do the push to bitbucket from the Linux box

Depending upon the number of samples and what you're actually doing, OpenCL can be really fast and can also use a graphics card to do the parallel processing if you have access to one. The main problems are that you need to write the calculation part in something very similar to C++ and that the surrounding code isn't very pretty either (but it's easier than doing everything in C++). If you really value speed of calculation on a large number of samples over your invested time, it might be a good option. Give me a shout if you want some template code or something. Disclaimer: I've never actually directly tested it versus other parallel programming in Python, but with a GPU it's really really fun to watch the results fly out. 
That is doable but it launches the code WITHIN VS Code and I'm looking for it to launch it outside of VSC in the python 3 launcher

A) ALWAYS POST THE EXACT ERROR. Don't just say "I got some sort of error, help". That kind of troubleshooting belongs in /r/Psychic B) from what you have said so far import urllib #does not produce an error from urllib import request #does produce some sort of error what does import urllib urllib.__file__ give you?
The best solution AMHA * clone the bitbucket repository on windows * add a remote repo targetting your linux repo for the push (ssh) * develop on windows * commit and push on the linux repo evry time you want to test (checkout only remote branch from windows to avoid a merge on the local branch on the linux repo) * test * push on bitbucket from windows whn you're satisfied &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;

Thanks, I'll start reading up on it. After I get a simple script working with pypyodbc, how do I go about making it usable accessible from a website?
I'm working on a command line assistant call [Jorina](https://github.com/tiazahmd/jorina). So far, it can show weather and convert units. I'm trying to incorporate a soccer fixture feature this week, but having a hard time finding a free API. Feel free to contribute, critique and suggest features. A lot of time we spend time on the terminal and I feel like if we can have small things like these performed on the terminal, people won't have to get distracted. That's the idea behind this project. 
Is the first Humble Bundle I buy, so idk if it'd work well for others. There might be some issues with it, I spent more time in the readme than in the actual script 😅.

every one of these is less well known (and more useful to put into a list like this given what people probably generally use instead) than basically everything on the op list. thanks for boltons and structlog!

Thanks ! I will do a blog post with the real lesser known list of python libs everyone should know ! Because tensorflow or peewee are really nice, but but common to every project. All my projects at work use structlog (connected to elasticsearch), and discovering Bolton really changed my life (want a real LRU cache or url parser ? =&gt; boltons)
Flask is probably your best bet.

Happy to help! Glad to see the magic methods getting more attention. I personally think they're incredibly useful but dont get nearly enough attention.
Expanding on a project I did a month or so ago: It creates QR codes for members of a group I co-run. The QR has name, member number, arethey paid or trial, what date that status expires. The qr is a different color hard on which of those status is true. Works great and now I'm learning how to create, edit and delete entries in a csv file (why CSV? Because spreadsheet for other purposes). All this done through a secure Flask site that I have mirrored locally -&gt; my vps.
Trying to automate the grindy bits in games that I don’t like doing. Unfortunately I’m still a beginner so I don’t know to much about what I’m doing. But I figure it will be nice to learn from 
Working on getting active configurations from a bunch of old procurve switches in our lab - to run weekly. They jumble up ssh, which has made an easy task, a little more challenging. I've found a few examples of code people have written to clean it up, but haven't gotten started on it yet. Should be a fun challenge for me.
&gt; Nope, that's a reputable CS journal: https://www.scmagazine.com/lost-devices-leading-cause-of-data-breaches-report/article/530198/ &gt; Considering that at the time of publication of this article, 2fa was mandatory, I'd say 100%. &gt;&gt; getting their hands on a corporate mobile device. So, not the general population. Just corporate devices. &gt; Considering that at the time of publication of this article, 2fa was mandatory, I'd say 100%. Again...because you say so? I've worked at plenty of places that provide corporate devices but do not enforce 2fa, including one last year. You're making niche case after assumption after niche case after assumption. &gt; What lets you claim? You seem to have no knowledge of the subject matter whatsoever. My claim is that porported to the consumers-- that 2fa exists for your security as an option, and not a quick buck. You are claiming that the security is bullshit and it's for a quick buck, taking on every organization ever that allows 2fa. Neither of us have any knowledge about the subject matter whatsoever. The difference is you have gone beyond skepticism and onto making a direct claim. And when you do so, then fucking prove it. It is in fact relatively a very easy claim to prove-- simply by looking at reported/estinated profits of companies before and after implementation in comparison to the rate of breaches before and after implementation, and showing that the latter is a significantly small decrease while the former is significantly high. Not to mention I'm sure that some independent group would have done such by now if 2fa is truely useless and for a quick buck as you say-- so just point to such an article. But instead of doing so you keep coming back with 100% opinionated or irrelevant bullshit.
user_input = input(“Which function do you want to run: “) If user_input.lower() == “hello”: some_function() elif user_input.lower() == “howdy”: other_function() Pretty much you take in a value from the user, saving it in a variable. Then you can check that value with if and elif statements. The .lower() method is just to normalize the user input. It makes it so that “HoWdY” == “howdy”. If you have any more question ask! Hope this helps!
Nice! I used to create similar scripts for downloading old exam sheets with their solutions back in my uni-days! Can't the "inspect element" steps be circumvented by using `wget url` to download the HTML? Might save some steps. 
Rookie mistake - We've all been there! Lots of wailing and gnashing of teeth. 
Very VERY new to Python but working on a couple projects. 1. Analysis on a large set of data that will spit out results for ~80 people to review and base their budget off of. I used to do this entirely in Excel and it'd take 5 minutes per location. Now I can spit out a spreadsheet for each location in less than 5 minutes total. Due to convenience I can now polish up these reports and give better results without weighing down the process even more. 2. Trying to figure out Flask so I can post a monthly report for our locations to review, comment, and approve.... I'm at the ground level on this one. Looking for any recommendations on best ways to learn this for a Python / Flask beginner. 3. Maybe tie #2 into #3 at some point... Also..... thank God for Pandas!!!! Coming from an Excel junky it was so easy for me to learn and such a powerful tool.....

Nice, can you hack one up for Packt? I have hundreds of their free daily books and tried, but their download page in your profile relies on JavaScript events. 
&gt; I get very easily distracted with video, which doesn't happen if I have to read. Maybe start by reading the sidebar, going to the sub suggested by the sidebar, and reading THAT sidebar. 
to be fair, the article was originally posted almost 20 months ago (Jan 2017)
&gt; having a hard time finding a free API. Have you considered web scraping? 
I have not actually. Good idea, I'm gonna try that!
Just keep in mind that some sports organizations restrict web scraping in their terms of service. I don't know about Premier League (or whichever league(s) you may be interested in) but the NHL expressly forbids it because they have their own stats service that they want people to use. 
Depends on what you want to show :) I'm making a React front that will talk to some backend services via REST. I'll be showing NFL results, weather, TV schedule and maybe some more things (I need ideas!). Basically, these are just API endpoints made in Flask (and Golang, in this case) that serve JSON. They talk to different APIs on the Internet, modify the data for my needs and return it to me when I ask. So, if you know Flask (or any other web framework, although Django might be an overkill), you could make this. Even if you don't, it's very easy to learn! The best way is to try and make it yourself.
The HTML page is generated with React, so you need a browser to render the HTML and execute the JS to create the final nodes. There are nicer ways around this (like using headless chrome), but the "inspect element" solution is the simplest one.
Yea, I have used it in the past and it is great! I am more making my own as a practice for myself. Ultimately, I would make the code so it could keep track of HP and spell slots too, but I don't want to get too far ahead of myself. 
Never never never put your API key on github :(
Thanks for that! Quite inspiring. I just might over this upcoming holiday weekend!
I 100% know this is a wrong thing to do. Can you suggest a workaround? 
Thank you! Your words are really fulfilling! I will try my best. I also think that it's better to code with some guys, who are sharing the same idea and vision which I have. So that the framework would develop more feature rich, more extensible and more beautiful. But first I have to do it on my own :P
Ah - that explains it! Cheers!

How are you trading or managing your crypto currency without 2FA? Finance has large professional IT systems and operates very differently. They don't really day trade from a phone on the bus. It's not really comparable. 
If you're new to coding chances are you aren't really worth paying for it. It's good to create a few projects for yourself. Develop something that interests you and figure out how to write it. Or you can work on opensource code.
Best way to keep your dick from bleeding is to keep it out of Microsofts pencil sharpener, I had similar issues with VS so after switching from notepad ++ and I ended up just using atom or pycharm for bigger projects, sometimes the solution to a problem is just to avoid the problem all together.

Site (with Django) that allows you to make lists of games like Goodreads do. User will be able to make 'want to play' list, for example and sort it by platforms. So if you wanted to buy a new console for a long time and finally bought it you could see all games you wanted to play immediately.
I'm building a POS system. [Github](https://github.com/Meeds122/Simple-POS) It's really just a way for me to practice GUI programming in python but it might become a useful product one day. 
Exactly. The first commenter who got the point right.
This. Another one is reading it from a file.
I’ve noticed some websites detect when using selenium for automation. Is there around this? 
Still working on /u/pythonHelperBot. Last week I took stock of the pros and cons of searching a local copy of stack overflow vs using the api to search the website. I think I'm still going to focus on the local copy search, and maybe use the api to search through the posts made to SO in between now and when the copy of the stack exchange data dump I use was published. That said, it's not simple and I have no promise that it'll be functional, so here's to hoping. I think I'll work on a fun program (or two) over the holiday weekend. I want to try using a neural net to build a monster generator following the D&amp;D monster manual style. I personally have a bias against neural nets, but this seems like an application that will be fun. I've also been wanting to make another twitter bot that posts small gifs of point clouds mimicking bird murmurations, and a vacation would be the perfect time to try to hack it out. 
Does this only work on books? Can it be made to work on other Humble Bundle products, Games, audiobooks, etc?
You're right, I'm sorry, I didn't notice the sidebar.

Certainly an event-based distributable web framework is an attractive proposition. Especially if you can get those events bubbling up to the UI (I find events work really well with MVC). Have you seen [Sanic](https://github.com/channelcat/sanic)? That could be useful to either use, or as something to use as a reference (or the underlying library it's based on). [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com) would also be worth a good look - they take the events all the way up to the UI, and have a nice protocol for distributing those events between clients, merging, and queuing them when offline (e.g. mobile apps). My main concern with what you've written is about how you'd deal with databases. You'd need to put your event log to file, and it would have to be able to be separated into chunks, so it could be properly versioned.. which is basically what Django's migrations is, give or take. You'd also need support for rollbacks. Is your vision that you'd be able to deploy changes to a live running system? That would be pretty cool, but then you'd need a transactional element too (which is nice, but an extra thing to think about). That would be a fun thing to design though.. like having it "upgrade" each micro-service at a time, and holding all tasks for those and releasing them when they're done, so an upgrade would sort of be like a wave, where old connections complete, and new connections are held just long enough to update the bit they need next. That's probably over-kill, but high availability could be a nice niche to push into if that's what you're thinking of doing. I'd also look at utilising an existing lower-level framework (like Flask) to get all the plumbing support with next to no effort, as that's a LOT of work. I also wouldn't re-invent the wheel with an ORM either, as that's a big project in itself. I would make it database system agnostic though, as NoSQL/relational databases have different use-cases.. I'm not going to learn / build-up a library of work for a framework I can't use for a large chunk of the projects I work on unless it really targets specific use-cases (like Meteor). And finally, my advice would be to work on getting a specification document complete before starting to get into the code proper, if you want to make this a project that you can get help with, and take it beyond a nice personal project. Some experimentation will be needed, of course, but if you don't have a plan.. how can people help? How do you know what you're building will all "fit" by the end? Good luck, and I look forward to seeing what you come up with!
Actually u/Endomorphism002 made a good [spreadsheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/3dfose/5e_monster_manual_spreadsheet/) with the Monster Manual and Volo's, cuts out most of the hard stuff. If you ever want to try again.

Ah alright thanks for pointing out some opportunities. It seems like there is nit that much money made in this field at least for a newbie like me. But where is the money are there certain frameworks which are high in the demand and therefore pay better even for noobs like me. Generally my intention is to monetize a hobby and I really like coding but can't really figure out how to make a dime of it?
Have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling?
Hey , i just wanted to say a huge thank you for this response its really helped me and given me the motivation to start searching harder and i think I've found some solid ground on where to start , flowcharts im working on write now and im gonna start doing my write up and assessment of my code. Thanks a Tonne :)
Go into that directory with the cd command from inside a CMD and then run the pip.exe freez command 
Well that's interesting. Good job!
&gt;- How do you handle logs? Do you log every API step, payload, response? [This](https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/logs-and-metrics-6d34d3026e38) article is sort of specific to Go, but I thought it was a good read. Specifically, &gt;“Only log actionable data” might sound great in theory, but debug logging is sometimes a necessary evil, something that is only ever useful to someone who has a deep understanding of the codebase or runtime. Like for instance, when I’m debugging something, I might already know the symptom (such as a crash or increased timeouts from a service) and maybe even the root cause (malformed input to the application or unexpected event loop stalls), and what I might really be aiming to do is connect the dots between root cause and symptom by retracing the code path traversed while servicing the request. -- &gt; - How do you structure these logs so its easy to debug later? At my job, we try to do a good job of demarcating *what* we want to log, *why* we want to log it, and the *level* of log to apply to that type. The comment [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/153524/code-to-logging-ratio#153547) describes one approach that is pretty similar to what we use. -- &gt;- How you handle API retries and failures? We log traceback and exceptions with enough state information that someone going back to troubleshoot can have a good start on where to look / what the user or system was doing. Or at least have a starting point when trying to reproduce the issue. Hope that gives some food for thought. 
Thank you for posting this! Very helpful info! I wish more people would post questions like this.
Yup, remember, you don't HAVE to do git push You can keep it all local if you want
Documentaries, like a movie about Python's reach and impact.
&gt; Maybe there alternate methods to overcome this problem? Don't develop on Windows.
Thanks! Any feedback and contributions are very welcome :)
how do you determine the paramenters for Codetype?
That worked, thanks.
Absolutely useful; have been thinking about something like this a while now. Thank you!
I mean there is a massive amount of money in coding. You just have to have enough skills to be worth paying. If you've never worked on a project then I don't think you're going to get work easily. You should maybe think about what you want to do with Python and keep learning and making your own projects. Like I was interested in making websites with Python so I learned flask to the point I could build a basic website. Keep learning and eventually you can definitely get paid for Python. There are millions and millions of people who can kind of program. But not a ton of people who are good at it. No one who is willing to put up money will want to hire you at a decent price when they can hire some dude in Bangladesh with a masters degree for next to nothing to write some basic code.

Oh, nice! I didn't know about this project, it looks so cool! I'm getting all, can't keep up with all the new libs 😔.
&gt; The qr is a different color based on which of those status is true. Why not integrate that directly into the QR code? 
**line 30** I would do this instead: (id, table, *lines, avg, stddev, median, highest) = row for line in lines: blah It looks like you're using python3.6, so that should work just fine. If you truly want the Average, StdDev, Median, and Highest columns included in lines, just remove those and do: (id, table, *lines) = row **line 44** Here's part of the problem with looping through n rows. results = [] at line 19. You then assign 10 columns in the first row to results in line 37. You then print results[0:6] which prints out the first 6 columns. Everything seems good so far, right? You then loop through the second row, and append 10 columns in the second row to results in line 37 (on the next pass). Results now has **20** entries in it, 10 from the first csv row, 10 from the second. You then print results [0:6] which prints out the first 6 columns, which are still from row 1.
Ahh, that makes more sense.
Oh okay cool. I was just making sure I wasn't missing something here 
👍Writing the script took me about 10 minutes. Downloading the files and creating the directories individually probably takes 3-5 mins. But I prefer to "invest" the time in creating something repeatable. Also, a few students also bought the bundle and they were facing the same issue.
Yeah sorry if it wasn't clear! It made sense in my head. The segno library is pretty sweet for QR generation. One lofty goal is to make a plugin for it that can use a background image or logo in the QR &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;

Fat interview for a big company in Silicon Valley. Hopefully I do well, the company I work at now is getting lame (ish). Gotta brush up on all those functional python gimmicks for the algos test.
Have you considered cross referencing the python docs? Might solve some portion of your problems with less memory strain. I’d also consider playing around with the SO content you store, there may be a way to get the best of both worlds and just store the most recent/popular questions and answers
No problem! Another cool thing you could do is design everything to be containerized in something like docker. A good docker config can spin up new instances of the components in your pipeline really fast in case of an error.
You need to reread OP's question.

For kicks and giggles, I'm writing an application framework similar to Electron. It uses webkit and a Python wsgi server to serve/use HTML/CSS/JS/WASM. The Python backend will handle interactions with the filesystem. Unlike Eel or other projects though, this app framework will contain a browser like how electron bundles chromium.

Hello Everyone, &amp;#x200B; I created a small blog and started documenting all the small scripts that were useful to me at some point. While working on my website, a plugin update crashed and took down my site. I created this small script to check on the website status code every couple of seconds, instead of me having to manually refresh the page to check if the website was up after each config change. &amp;#x200B; Please let me know if theres any way i can make the code better. I'm always willing to learn and become better with python
Could you move it into a repository?
How familiar are you with PRAW/Python? The docs are pretty straight forward. However, if you are new to python I suggest you get yourself a little more familiar first. 
I checked out the website and it says the data is in the cloud. I would call their support and see if they have an api.
Actually just tried for an hour to get that working. It only downloads the first page of books (up to 50) without using one of the patches that only half works (the patch has not been merged, look at bug #27). Then there are some UTF encoding errors that are unresolved (even with the patch suggested). That script is only partly working and the developer looks to have lost interest. There are some npm's that purport to do the same thing but have not tried them out. 
It would definitely help if you could describe in more detail what exactly you were trying to do. Without something more specific it is hard to give advice. 
I can recommend [Multiping](https://pypi.org/project/multiping/). You can have it ping your site alongside Google's servers (or any reliable servers) to check if your site is down or if your internet is just down. I bring it up because I use it for something similar. Also something happened with the code formatting on your site, the indentation seems to have gone.
Because some people prefer videos? 
Thanks! This is wonderful! I haven't had time yet to dig into it... but 'An Introduction to Machine Learning Interpretability" in the ML package is only EPUB and if I select more than just EPUB, the script bombs out when it hits that book because the PDF and MOBI formats aren't there. I'll poke around at it some more, maybe there is exception handling that just needs to be thrown in there, or maybe I did something wrong because it sounds like it worked for you. Anyway, awesome work &amp; thanks again!
&gt;thinktreeit.com/progra... Multiping looks like a great alternative. Checking out it now. Thanks for the catch, I'm having the indentation issue in every browser other than chrome.
actually that's BS. It's posted as a video for monetization. There's a reason why many subreddits no longer allow video self.posts or require at minimum the transcript to be posted in the post text. (ofc, I'm also salty because I can't youtube at work).
Sure. Some article sites like medium also allow monetisation. Do we ban them too? Some people like different methods of content delivery. If it's not your thing it's not like there's a shortage of textual flask tutorials.

Lol you're asking us to write your article for you? 
Just going to list them as I see them. 1. In **\_\_init\_\_.py** you don't need to import detector. That should be handled by the user and in your README example you import it manually anyway. 2. **self.alphabet** should really be a set. The reason is that when you use **in** to check for inclusion it needs to check every element in **self.alphabet**. If you used a set instead it would be an O(1) operation as opposed to O(n) 3. You expect the data to be in **~/** or **APPODATA** but nowhere is this specified in the README. You should allow the user to pass in **homedir** as a CLI parameter and got the value using something like argparse [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html). 4. **create_word_set** contains a ton of hard coded paths, none of which are specified in the README. **download** dumps a bunch of files onto the user's system. This is a bit of a no-no. You should really allow the user to tell you where they want the files to go rather than deciding for them. Also more hard coded paths; at least put them in the README. 5. I would mangle the rest of the function names if you only want to expose two of the functions to the user. 6. You can simply use **return accuracy &gt; 0.65** rather than **return True if accuracy &gt; 0.65 else False**. they both return the same thing.
Smells like homework
Do you have any example texts? Assuming that the text is formatted, each paragraph is split by multiple newline characters and prepended with a tab so you can simply call **str.split('\n\n\t')** to get a list of paragraphs.

The biggest difference is the number. One of them is numbered '2', while the other is numbered '3'. Some people have suggested that Python 3 is odd, which is fitting given that 3 is an odd number. And because it was designed to replace, rather than complement, Python 2, Python 3 does not provide a built-in module for performing two's-complement arithmetic. Finally, Python 3 is known not to be Turing complete, which does significantly diminish its utility for some cases but also allows it to escape the halting problem, which means I can halt this list of suggestions.
I worked for a year at the company that runs Know Your Meme. Cool project! Mind if I share it with them?
Clean code, testing and version control also. I work with scientists, and their code usually works, but is far from being readable or maintainable. They also collect many Python scripts with different file names encoding special versions. Results in a large amount of code duplication.
I'd say the name was a bit more than a clue. It's an [ordinal date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_date). These things exist outside pandas. 
**Ordinal date** An ordinal date is a calendar date typically consisting of a year and a day of year ranging between 1 and 366 (starting on January 1), though year may sometimes be omitted.

My pleasure ! Give us some feedback other freelancers may be interested. 2 other tips: If you really want to apply a triangular workflow allowing you to push from the linux repo and from windows also change /tmp/windows/myproject&gt;cd /tmp/linux /tmp/linux&gt;git clone /tmp/windows/myproject with: /tmp/windows/myproject&gt;cd /tmp/linux /tmp/linux&gt;git clone --origin windows /tmp/windows/myproject /tmp/linux&gt;cd myproject /tmp/linux/myproject&gt;git remote add origin /tmp/bitbucket/myproject This way you can push to "origin" as usual from the linux box. If you make a mistake, you can rename the remote name. See [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes) &amp;#x200B; And finally as you work on Linux and Windows, you may have to handle EOL characters cleanly for several kind of files. Check that: [https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings/](https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings/) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;

How they handle output. This line: print(flip(rnd())) &amp;#x200B; You can try and change to: flip(rnd()) without print command And i guess you will get almost same result in any env you tried.
Sublime Text probably buffers the output instead of writing each print separately.
Alright, in that case, the easiest way of handling would be to set up SFTP deployment to transfer the files from the IDE to the Docker host. In turn, use a volume to get these files into the container. You can configure SFTP deployment in Tools | Deployment. After this everything should work. Let me know how things go!
I made a bot with python/praw where I get the user input and I send a json format array with the url and the title of the article. I can create manually a json api online with that json file and upload it on chatfuel. I would like to be able to get the user input on messenger, so create a user attribute. Send it through the json api and be able to connect with my python file to find the information. Can I do that?
Thank you for this good answer! Yes, you are totally right about alphabet. I will change it. About the custom download location, if I let users customize the download location, should I save the location and use it on "create\_word\_set" function? And what would you suggest about create\_word\_set? Do you have any other better way in your mind, if yes I would be more than glad if you could share with me. Yes I thought about mangling the names but just in case if they would like to use "splits" and "list\_words" function I didn't do it. Changing to that line seems nice to me.
Can you provide more details? After filtering out information from a signal it's not possible to "restore" it. You can reverse some of the induced filter effects like group delay or phase shifts but things removed by the filter can't really be restored.
Someone else can correct me if I am wrong (as I am not so much a Python guru), but what I would change in your code is the following: 1. pass uniq\_list and df2 as arguments of the function 2. you iterate over uniq\_list and pass the values to the function, which does not use the value it recieves, but rather iterates over the list again, which I asume is not what you want 3. the error you get is because of `if df2[df2['Sum of Qtk'] == uniq]:`; the error is telling you that you should use DataFrame.empty as an assertion if the DataFrame is populated or not; so you should rewrite it as `if !df2[df2['Sum of Qtk'] == uniq].empty:`
r/learnpython can help you out with stuff like this 
Yup, that’s what I’ve come up with as well. Maybe try this though? if not df2[df2[“Sum of Qtk”] == uniq].empty I am struggling to understand what the OP is actually trying to achieve as an output though. There *has* to be a better way, perhaps using a groupby?
Got it. It solved the error issue. if df2.loc[df2['Sum of Qtd'] != uniq].empty: This is the final code that I used. However still I am unable to make the subsets of data based on the unique values of the column 'Sum of Qdk'. Could you please help me on that? Or at least any other hint, what I need to improve in my code. Thanks in advance, 
Ok then, and what do you think about plots?

The windows shell is well known for being slow. Anything timing critical should stay far away from it.
You can do it that way, but it is rather counterintuitive. The problem is, that you are here selecting a subset of your DataFrame just to figure if it is not empty. Also: `df2.loc[df2['Sum of Qtk'] != uniq]` is not the same as `not df2.loc[df2['Sum of Qtk'] == uniq]` This means that in your solution you are not asserting the same thing as you are in your original code. I would suggest you first create a subset of the DataFrame and then if you must, use `if DataFrame.empty` on the subset DataFrame. Because `df2[df2['Sum of Qtk'] == uniq]` should already give you the subset in a form of a DataFrame, which cannot be empty (as you used `DataFrame.unique()` to find the values present in the column of interest), your assertion for absence of emptiness does not provide any additional information. It is just not necessary. So if I may ask, how should your output look? You want a DataFrame for each unique value? If so, how are you packing these together - list, dictionary etc.? 
Indeed, you are right. Yours is much more pythonic. &amp;#x200B; Groupby looks like the easiest option to me too. Or maybe just maping a selection lambda function to the list of unique values. I would guess it also depends on how the output would be used down the line.
Wow this is great! I had no idea 
Matter of fact, I applied butterworth filtering to a signal and I recovered the new filtered signal using the lfilter. I was just wondering, out of curiosity, how it did recover it because, as far as I know, we recover signal in the frequency space (using Fourier) or in time space using other methods. But when I looked up the documentation I didn't find it (unless when used some specific terms)
Can you share your memojis?
Then there are a couple of ways to do it. One is of course groupby, which was already mentioned by others, so I will not use it. I will rather use what you already used. `df2[df2['Sum of Qtd'] == uniq]` lets you select the rows that you want, so just use it inside a loop over all unique values in the column. This is what you tried to do, but the better option would be to just do it in a loop and get rid of the function, except if you would need it multiple times in your code. The result would be something like this: uniq_values = df2['Sum of Qtd'].unique().tolist() df_list = [] for uniq in unique: df_list.append(df2[df2['Sum of Qtd'] == uniq]) Which can be abreviated to just list comprehention: df_list = [df2[df2['Sum of Qtd'] == uniq] for uniq in df2['Sum of Qtd'].unique()] Another way would also be to just map it instead: df_list = list(map(lambda uniq: df2[df2['Sum of Qtd'] == uniq], df2['Sum of Qtd'].unique().tolist()))
`lfilter` applies the filter's transform by multiplying the time-domain signal by the B and A coefficients corresponding to the input and output weights.

Is it a one-off presentation of static data? Use Photoshop, Excel, or Power Point, depending on format. Does it need to be fed data constantly? Separate your data from your presentation. I'd vote for SQLite for a quick and dirty data storage job, but you also have alternatives like pickle or SQLAlchemy, depending on your specific needs. For presentation on the web, grab your favorite web framework (they're all equally capable of this job) and use a separate Javascript library for graphic rendering. I find raw D3 to be a bit labor intensive, but there are a hundred thousand specialized D3 wrappers out there. It's hard to suggest anything concrete with this vague of a description.
I’m looking for a general purpose library for web presentation. I agree with your description of D3 being labor intensive, I’ll look into some of those wrappers. Have a favorite?

I'm pretty sure it's random.choice()
reverse engineering a couple web applications for scraping purposes... Here's a tip for web developers: if you create an internal API for your web application, and the purpose is that it can only be used by users that are logged in, when on a specific page of the site, and you load 40 ish rows of data per request call, and about 5 or 6 rows of those are visible to the user at once in a screen and the rest have to be viewed while scrolling/dragging, it will take a while before they reach the end of that response... even if it's only going to be used for internal usage, make sure to add better rate limits than the example I've seen this week: 40-50 results per page (it really feels like a RNG that decides how many results are sent), and 500-1000 pages before you get rate limited, and within 30 seconds you can continue scraping. Result: 100k rows can be scraped within 10 minutes, from a system that is normally only used by users scrolling with a mouse or dragging with their fingers from the mobile app. It makes it really nice for me when I'm scraping but please, don't do this... if your public API, that doesn't have access to this specific part of the site, has a version for unverified applications and is rate limited at 1000 requests an hour, and a total of 5000 requests a day, this is a bad practice. 
 flip=lambda c:"H" if c&lt;.5 else "T" %%timeit flip(random.random()) **166 ns ± 0.892 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each)** %%timeit random.choice(["H","T"]) **820 ns ± 16 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each)**
You just changed a single comparison into a multiple, truncate, and index into a list. The first way was perfectly reasonable for a binary choice. 
Don't beat yourself up! *Nobody* can keep up with all of the Python libraries that are coming out..
There is a lot to be desired in your question. Are you taking in one currency and printing the conversions? What are your inputs? What are your outputs? What *exactly* are you doing?
People are generally not aware of how slow IO is, in general, compared to loops and most boilerplate.
**Download:** That would probably be a good way to go about it. I would also add a parameter with a default value to **create_word_set** so that the user can choose to move the data after the fact if they'd like but would otherwise default to the stored location. **create_word_set:** The issues for this function will be fixed if you change the way **homedir** is handled. So you're all good.

Of course, syscalls have overhead. It is likely not just slower, but \*slow\* because it's on Windows.
Not sure if this is anywhere close to what you have in mind, but... You could create a simple M4L device that generates data from your MIDI or audio signals and sends output over UDP, the same way that open sound control (OSC) works. Then you could have a Python process listening on UDP and responding to the output. I have thought about doing this in reverse (Python generates OSC messages based on some other data, MaxMSP listens and generates sound) as a way to do data sonification. Never got around to doing it though... Now I’m curious what you’re working on here!
that's a stupid statement. Print operations are generally expensive, like really expensive
FYI in the future, avoid printing in a loop, append to a list and print that after. /u/DeathProgramming said it, I/O operations are expensive.
Oh really? I'd always heard (or interpreted) it to be the other way around so I've never looked into Django. I'll have to watch some tutorials on it now.
lfilter does not "recover" the original signal. It is a causal function that introduces phase delays, it often is not linear so it introduces group delay as well. Compare this to filtfilt which introduces zero phase delay as it filters as well as being linear. filtfilt is a backwards and forwards filter but can only be used on signals that have already been fully recorded whereas ifilter is forwards only. I'm still confused by your question, perhaps because I don't understand your use of the terminology, specifically by "recovery of the signal" because this means something very specific in DSP. Are you just asking how the computation is made? https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.18.1/reference/generated/scipy.signal.lfilter.html 
Ok i will consider it .
Probably do it because they don't know better
Any examples of this from open source stuff? I can’t say I’ve ever seen this in a serious project.
Good underdog victory :thumbs\_up:
huh TIL

Incredible articles! I'm reading every single one when these notifications reach my new Moto 6.
I also used to do it, check an example: https://github.com/Aens/Ts3PyBot That was my first project, and truth is that I didn't know how to create classes or import my own classes/files/modules. For people self-taughing themselves like me, having everything in 1 file is easier.
I see this most often in projects that have minimal external dependencies. It's either in __init__ or some other mega.py file. I'll say it tends to be very clean API projects, but you can solve that so much better.
Is there a text version of the same tutorial?
I think sometimes it's people who really hate having a bunch of import statements at the top of their other files.
Fixed above
Lol, while that is definitely /r/hailcorporate material, it was an interesting article. Nice to see an article that isn't yet another "Your first pandas DataFrame!" article. 
I’ve just started making something similar, but in R and Shiny, as I’m much more experienced with that. It’s not exactly up R’s alley though, so I’ve thought about trying it in Python.
You really don't know what you're talking about. By not having a real dependency solver, pip can break a Pytohn installation quite easily.
One thing you might want to look into is [https://github.com/dropbox/pyannotate](https://github.com/dropbox/pyannotate) This generates type annotations for your code based on its runtime behavior.
Heads up: This was already posted a couple days ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9aoi35/i_dont_like_notebooks_joel_grus_jupytercon_2018/)
Damn, thanks for catching that.
Really, the package level \_\_init\_\_.py should have almost nothing in it. A few exceptions are: * A general docstring at the top. This will be printed if you ever use pydoc * Imports for some of the more common functions: * e.g.: from module1 import function1 * This lets you use the function as package.function1 instead of package.module1.function1 * You can also list your name/email and the version of the code with some dunder: * e.g.: \_\_author\_\_ = "My Name"
?? Why only these two choices ? `result = random.random() &lt; 0.5`
NP. I think Reddit didn't catch it and tell you during submission because your link has some parameters on the end of it: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n2RlMdmv1p25Xy5thJUhkKGvjtV-dkAIsUXP-AL4ffI/preview**#slide=id.g362da58057_0_1**
Hi pal Ive managed to code up my web sockets for several exchanges but cant seem to start more than 1 thread at a time, I get a thread started and it executes correctly but no code after that will run. Any help is appreciated, Cheers. 
Guilty of this but because of ignorance and I learn it is way better importing your modules. 
Gathering GPS data from a sensor in the field and transferring it to a database. The GPS client is a publisher for the MQTT broker. The channel on which the sensor publishes is subscribed by my Python script which also acts as a client and writes the data into DB after processing it.
I'm sorry by recovering the signal I meant finding the filtered signal. I'll check this out thank you! 
That's exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!
&gt; I then have 50-100+ lines of import statements. :-o
That is much more a case of someone putting a ton of classes in one file. Of the 20+ classes the majority of __init__s are short. There are a few that do some validation checks but I didn't see any that go into the 40 line range. My personal guess is colander wanted to keep things simple for dealing with supporting both Python2 and Python3. So all the classes are crammed into one file. Working with imports that will work for both 2 and 3 seems to be a bugbear.
Yep, and terminal IO is generally slow in most systems. Thing is, loops are also superfast and optimised in any modern language, so when you do something that is just near-memory shuffling and loops, then anything else is going to be super slow in comparison, even the statistics themselves are bound to be a significant performance hit.
&gt; Auto-completing filenames is actually a quite neat feature since a notebook session is very likely to involve a number of data files. I agree there are useful cases, especially when doing something like `!cat filename.py`, I think the current implementation it prioritizes filenames over other variables. PyCharm I do agree is overkill, VSCode seems to strike the right balance, I get some pretty good autocomplete (although I did run into an issue: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/2446 ) a good debugger, and easy selection of which python kernel to use (oh, and a terminal pane easily accessible from the editor). I'm not sure if you've used them but I *really* like how R-notebooks are done (I think they're only a thing inside RStudio though). While you could certainly get the weird state behavior, it's a little tougher to do so; but you have the nice embedding of markdown/images/text/code which notebooks provide.
How else do you manage 120k lines of code? I'm not going to use `import *`.
What had been grinding me gears lately is peoples suggestions to put things in helpers.py or urils.py especially in the context of Django apps. That's just lazy and isn't modelling anything oir making it any clearer for anyone who has to come along and pick up your code afterwards. 
Yeah no problem pal but I figured it out, turns out Python is a bit picky about the structure of your projects and I had a while true loop initiating before I was calling my threads. thus only one thread would be initialised. I'm away from my PC for the rest of the night but ill post a link tomorrow. Once I get it put together as I decided to go with a modular approach to make it easier to find bugs to start with lol.
I'm a scientist (astrophysics) and I use python mainly for plotting (mostly matplotlib) and scripting. What I like about matplotlib is the ability to explore the data via zooming and panning, etc. and the ease of making publication quality plots. I think scripting is a very valuable use of python since shell scripting is so much more awkward. Also, I often need to run code (written by others and often compiled) that requires a variety of inputs. With python I can create scripts that effectively document how I ran the code and where I got my inputs. Also if I need to create a pipeline in which one routine's output is the next one's input, that's documented by the script. I am sympathetic to the concerns of the Software Carpentry folks, but I find the focus on "software releases" and such not relevant to my work particularly. Few scientists are actually releasing software. Most are using code or writing code with fairly narrow applicability and are not likely to actually release their code publicly. Version control and documentation are still important of course.
I’ve done this using JavaScript. I did it using Wikipedia though. Any word I would type would result in articles relating to that word. I used Wikipedia’s API (which is beyond weird). I guess what I’m trying to say is that if it’s possible to do on Wikipedia using JavaScript, then it should work using python on reddit. 
`map` and `filter` return iterators in Python 3, so this is very out of date.
The problem is request limits. In theory one could run several hundred bots on VM's to hit the request limit on each one to effectively search all of reddit but that does not seem like the right approach to me 
Just use strings in this case. E.g. `def my_func() -&gt; 'Docfile'` 
The list() was intentionally left out as not to obfuscate, but I've added a comment now. map(lambda x: x * x, integers) instead of list(map(lambda x: x * x, integers)) hardly makes it very out of date imo.
Real python is the first place that got me started on understanding decorators. This says that. 
I still use their decorator guide from time to time. Especially when I’m making something and I have to refactor it. It’s a good, “should this be a decorator” jogger.

&gt; Matplotlib 3 only supports python 3.5 and higher. &amp;#x200B; Excellent! &amp;#x200B;
Need some more information to help. Can you write out the folder and the exact commands you are executing on the command prompt? For example: In D:\pythontest I run "python main.py" 
C:\python27\python.exe e:\sophos\siem.py Thats the exact command I'm running.
Your class definitions are pretty weird, but they're weird in a way that's understandable if you're coming from C#. I recommend reading a tutorial on Python classes, maybe something like [this](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/06/18/improve-your-python-python-classes-and-object-oriented-programming/). The main point is this: all of the variables you tried to give your classes are *class attributes*, not *instance attributes*. That means that all of your `DescriptionInfo` instances would share the same `Id` attribute, for example. Based on the names you gave things, I suspect that you need to move all of those into your `__init__` methods, which you should think of as the constructor for the class.
Ah okay. I suspect if you run it as *commands below* e: cd sophos C:\python27\python.exe siem.py * end of commands* It should atleast solve this problem. There is a line in the code that goes app_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd()) Since your current working directory is not sophos its not able to find the config file. The alternative is to set environment variables for the siem home folder. This is slightly more work for a windows user. Eager to hear if this solved your problem. 
Thank you very much for your input!!! I made some changes on my GitHub if you want to check it out.. is that what you are referring to? &amp;#x200B; [https://github.com/oze4/oPyn\_weather\_map](https://github.com/oze4/oPyn_weather_map) \[to make it easy on you ;)\]
These guys are professionals. It is because: 1. colander is a form validation library; it's tight and fits into 1 \_\_init\_\_.py 2. If you broke it out into files - what are you going to put it into? [validators.py](https://validators.py) which is 2000 lines long? Or create a file for each validator? You would end up with a buncha small files. 3. \_\_init\_\_.py can be anything; saying it needs to be just imports or \_\_doc\_\_ is foolish consistency
Again, my linter settings forbids wildcard imports (or unused imports), but I rarely get more than 30 lines of imports statements in a single file in my large-ish projects (~25-50k loc). Much more typical is to have just one to five import statements in module. Looking at the three largest projects in my virtualenv (scipy, numpy, and django), I found: * **scipy** in the 492 python files with 108k loc, there were zero files with more than 20 import statements. * **numpy** in the 333 python files with 93k loc, there were zero files with more than 30 import statements and 291 files with 0-9 import statements. * django in the 707 python files with 75k loc, there were two files with more than 30 import statements (/contrib/admin/options.py` with 36 and `/test/testcases.py`. I'm running `for f in `find . -name '*.py'`; do x=`grep -ce '^\(import \|from .* import\)' $f`; printf "%02d $f\n" $x &gt;&gt; import_count ; done` inside a project to get number of import statements and then using `sort import_count` to get them, and in my virtualenv only one file (`IPython/core/interactiveshell.py`) had over 50 import statements (it had 60), out of 4821 python files. If you frequently have 50 plus lines of import statements that seems hellish to maintain and seems like you need better abstractions and interfaces separating features.
Much better! Next stop is [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), the semi-official style guide. It's obviously not required, but if you adhere to it where possible it'll make your code much more readable, especially by other people.
THANK YOU! Gold coming your way!
I don't personally have any issues with it, but I try to avoid throwing things into \_\_init\_\_ unless it makes sense. An argument I've head is that they don't want the code accessible in two locations, both in the submodule and in the package namespace. There are of course ways to deal with that. &amp;#x200B; When way too much magic happens in \_\_init\_\_ .. that's what frustrates me personally. You're reading through the code and realize way too late there might be some logic in \_\_init\_\_ messing with things.

I've heard one of the reasons for fake implementations in openstackclient is simply that mocking all the clients this project is using is not easy. All clients are moving pretty fast in development. The api itself is not supposed to change with the exception of additions, but the internals keep changing. That keeps breaking the mocks and it's not worth spending time on it.
go check out bokeh besides matplotlib, I just learned about it from this post. But I agree, thanks for the post
Glad to hear it helped! Cheers! 
I tried and I didn't like them. Since you didn't read me: PyCharm is my choice.
Way to limit your subreddit and ultimately prevent someone from learning. That dude was helping me. Fuck you. 
The skillset required to land a job and be a good engineer is different. Work on your resume, do many many interviews and observe the market. 
The mailing list is good. But mostly as a notification that they’ve added a new work through on a library or topic. I’d head there and just look through the content they have up and see if anything jumps at you that you’ve been thinking about learning. 
Thanks, there was actual stuff I didn't know and not just DID YOU KNOW YOU CAN HEAD AND DESCRIBE. What I really need is someone to help me untangle the multiindex, xs, unstack, melt, pivot mess 
While I think those projects are large-ish, I don't know if that's only considering python code vs C code. Scipy is largely a wrapper around fortran libraries. Numpy in particular is pretty bad from a linting perspective. array, ssin, cos, etc. will throw imprt don't exist warnings because they are created at runtime. So yes, they're better in many aspects, but not ideal. So to an ideal structure for 140k lines of code. Do you want a flat structure, do you want no more than 2000 lines per file, do you want minimal dependencies, or do you want logically grouped functions/classes or do you want to not have to scroll down in your IDE's function/class list? They're in conflict. I work on a legacy file format that has 700+ cards. There are 7 types of quad element, 2 types of hexahedron/tetrahedon/pentahedon/pyramid, 4 types of springs/dampers, 3 bushings, 13 materials, ~16 material dependencies, 4 types of points, 7 coordinate systems, etc. Each element has 3+ result types (real, frequency, random) and there are 60+ elements. There's just not a good way to do it.
Wow! This is very cool. Thank you 
cool my dude tell phatkoala she did a gr8 job
def cond01(a, b): a == 2 b == 4 if cond01 == 2: return (a + b) * 2 else: return a - b
Read the sidebar please.
Actually I'm sort of confused with your code. Why are we checking the value of cond01? 
Yeah sorry! 
When you're making a small library that's less than 500 lines with no easy delineation between function groups or classes, I can see only using __init__.py as a passable option. Anything more than that gets too crazy for a single file and needs to be broken out for sanity sake...
Find the site_packages folder. Things install into it. 
Dunno why you’re being downvoted. Windows CONHOST *is* really slow. They’re putting a lot of work into it right now. Maybe it’ll be better soon.
I'm guessing you're on windows? It isn't working because the folder containing python.exe is not on your Path environment variable.
How would I change that?
Thanks will try it out 
&gt;These guys are professionals. Like that makes any difference these days. I agree with your other points but not this one.

__init__.py is one of Python's most glaring misfeatures. It is confusing, and it lets people perform all sorts of magic that makes it very difficult to understand the code in some projects.
Not an open source project, but part of the standard library: the logging package. All of its "core" code is in __init__.py: the main classes (Formatter, Handler, LogRecord, Filter, Logger, others), the basic handlers, and some global functions. Special-purpose handler subclasses are in `logging.handlers`, config stuff is in `logging.config`. These aren't sub-packages, they're just modules, handlers.py, config.py, in the "logging" directory. I'm not citing the package as a role-model in this regard, just an example. It's hardly a PEP 8 showcase, either. I've seen other examples -- pyparsing, iirc.
A few missing things: * Add a link to PyPI and possibly also a pipy badge displaying the latest version number * Add classifiers to your ``setup()`` * Include readme.md as the long_description in ``setup.py()``). This also means specifying ``long_description_content_type='text/markdown'``. Example setup.py from one of my own projects https://github.com/Contraz/demosys-py/blob/master/setup.py
I've been using Tkinter to make a gui for a set of tools I use. If anyone has some good tips for tkinter I would love to hear! I'm still very new to python... One thing I did want to do was... In the main frame I have it split with two text boxes (left box &amp; right box). Between the boxes is the left box scroll bar. How would you make it so you can move it left or right to change the size of the boxes? For example if you move it left the left box gets smaller while the right one gets bigger. 
It’s minecraft(gotta start somewhere) and I doubt they care if it’s on my own single player world
Why is people downvoting him? ^ Not defending, just curious.
You can also learn a lot from reading code in projects you are interested in. For example on github. Start with simple/small projects. Take what you have learned and apply it to your own programs. Ask questions and don't assume anything. Being curious is a good habit.
Yeah should be all good then. How are you going about it? 
Isn’t this just showing the available SSID’s that are broadcasting? I don’t see what it has to do with users connected? I would think you would need to do an arp after connecting to the ssid to probe for some user information. 
There may be a library like that. If not, my quick and dirty approach would be this: 1) manually threshold a subset as of wide a variety of images as possible. Start with 500. Do more later if the classifier is making bad decisions. 2) Make a classifier that can judge if an image is good or not. (See below) 3) write a script to iterate through each file, and through threshold values for each file. Generate the thresholded images, use the classifier to determine which is best, and write that one to a file. Classifier: if you can calculate features yourself, use a random forest or svm (Or something like tpot which will choose the best model for you). Features would be values that would correlate with making a correct decision. Fractal dimension may be enough on it's own honestly, but think of some others too. Ratio of black to white? If you can't think of enough features, then use a basic convolutional neural net in Keras. This will probably take more data. 3000 good and 3000 bad (use equal numbers of both) is maybe/probably enough. If this is your first rodeo, it's going to be slow going. Probably take longer to automate than to do manually. But, this is a great situation to learn from, so I highly suggest going for it if you can spare the time.
I usually see two main reasons for this. **Easier deployements**, single files are just simpler to deploy. Some of these authors are releasing to github part of a larger project, and having a single file with no other project dependencies may make sense to them. They know they can release this file, move it around or use it in other projects without too much worry. This practice is common in other languages - see the [single file libs](https://github.com/nothings/single_file_libs) for c programming which highlight projects where all the code is in the header file. **Development workflows**, for instance some development environments allow you to fold code, jump around sections of the same file much faster than jumping between files. For example, this is how I have structured my vimrc: http://recordit.co/YcWSmDyF2G For some using multiple files may simply be an unproductive design pattern. **Personally I prefer to use multiple files** - however we are all time poor and I would rather have access to an awesome library rather than have the author not publish it because they don't have the time to structure it to how others want. 
I've done this before, there was no good reason behind it, I just didn't know better. I started writing it as a single small Python script, so it was just a "main.py" and nothing else, then it grew, a lot, and before I knew it I had a few thousand lines in the single script. At some point I had to stop and modularise it properly, but I had never done that before and had no idea what I was doing, so I did the bare minimum of moving it all into \_\_init\_\_.py and continuing on. Sure I started actually creating modules of new things from there on out, but that \_\_init\_\_.py file is still thousands of lines long and near impossible to maintain properly.

I don't take it personally lol I only used python for small scripts, nothing major. I just wasn't sure, if I was asked this question ever I'd at least like to be able to talk about a language I understood better vs never used.
They're not really comparable. Windows Cmd and Powershell and Posix sh derivatives are not pleasant languages to build applications in, but they make much better shells than a Python REPL. If you're being asked about them, the question is aimed at working shell environments, not at any old programming language that has a REPL. If I may: Learn how to use your shell. It's a very valuable skill for an IT professional to have. You don't realize how much time you waste being inefficient until you learn how to use your power tools effectively.
Indeed. I find it useful at the top of a package, where you can make any changes you want to see to the package API (like bringing something like "a.b.B" up to "a.B". This is great for bringing forward the classes to be used and tucking away the components (base classes, mixins, etc).
Oh dear, wildcard imports. I'm honestly not sure which I find to be more disappointing.
Firstly, *sick vimrc*. Secondly, &gt; **Easier deployements**, single files are just simpler to deploy. In that case it should just be one file instead of a directory with one \_\_init\_\_.py, no?
Are you sure that all are running the same version of Python? Python 3 deals with large `range`s much more efficiently than 2. Maybe sublime is using version 3 and the others are using version 2?
They're not the same kind of thing in a practical sense, even though they are both scripting languages. Identifying Python as similar to Bash because they both have a REPL, is like identifying a truck as a car because they both have an engine. Python is a general purpose programming language. Bash is a specialized language for the purpose of quick and dirty automation, via connecting the output of one command to the input of another command (broadly speaking). The short name of that category is [shell scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script) The result is that, while you can use Python to do many of the things that you could do with Bash, it will take more work, because you are using a general rather than specialized tool. This is true even at basic levels of Python or Bash proficiency, and the disparity in effectiveness between Python and Bash expands rapidly as you get into expert usage. Lastly, a REPL *is* a kind -- the most common kind, even -- of command line. But there are multiple usages of the term 'command line'. A second usage is 'command line tool' or 'command line automation' -- the former being 'the kind of tool that you would invoke from a *shell scripting* commandline', and the latter being 'a shell script suitable for interpretation by Bash or another shell-scripting language'. This is a subtle but important point.

Oh, thought that maybe the IDEs you suggested were bad.
opencv has sone great image processing tools: https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.0/d7/d4d/tutorial_py_thresholding.html. 
I expect this mostly happens when a package started its development as a single module. After a certain point, it made sense to make it a package instead, so `foo.py` got moved to `foo/__init__.py`, which works with no changes (to either the user code calling the API or to the implementation). Newer code might be added to separate submodules, but it may not be worth the risk of introducing bugs to move around all of the existing the code.
How is this "new"? Using this feature freely in python 3.5...
Thanks for the compliment on the vimrc. You still need in __init__.py to import as a module, but yes - some projects like the PeeWee ORM have a single file - in this case peewee.py which is massive but depending on your environment may be more manageable as a single file.
Check out r/learnpython
I'm sure all of them uses same version.
So on Linux you have the absolutely fantastic inotify. OSX is BSD at heart so you should look at FSEvents. I think FSWatch should be available as a means of using FSEvents in a far easier way. I can't guarantee this is the right way of going about things, but it is where my searching would begin. You really should check if OSX doesn't have it's own Apple API though. Look into how Dropbox does it because I *think* their client is written in Python... 
No. They are not the same. That's like me asking you if you can drive a motorcycle and you answer by telling me you can drive a car. Whilst you can do most of what a motorcycle can, you can't do everything and can't go everywhere it can. Asking about bash is really asking if you have shell knowledge. For example, you can write a sysinit script in bash but you can't in Python. When they ask can you drive anything like a Honda (bash) motorcycle then saying you can drive a Ducatti (zsh) or a moped (Powershell) is perfectly fine. It's still a motorcycle. You've answered their question. 
There is. The answer is don't. Trust me. I've done it. It was a poor experience. You're better off just doing it native if you need to, or going with React Native. React is a skill that's worth it's weight in gold in the job market right now.

Start by reading the sidebar Then google something like "python xml example"
Maybe? I wanted to keep the code of my suggestion short as it is aimed to make beginners write more readable code. Then commenters started doing pontless things like measuring the running time of python code that outputs to the sceen in nanoseconds. 
This is Python. We take huge libraries and frameworks written by others, often times in other languages, and glue them together with a couple of lines of our own Python code. I think it's rather appropriate.
It just like index.html in html.
I don't know java 
Nice, very interesting!
On mobile so just put them on drive for now pal. Code works and starts new threads for each WS but I haven't finished parsing the ticker data. https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1YSihY91RW5-dkPt7Oz04HoUQPCG8RTDy 
Agree, so I just use seaborn: simpler API, better looking defaults (IMO). Of course that means also less ability to customize, but that's ok 99,9 % of the time and the other time I could go into matplotib (or realistically just say "can't be done":)). Maybe mathplotlib should be considered in the same leagues as d3.js: a very flexible and powerful library that you build other libraries from, but you only dive into when you really need to? 
Oh my fuck mate, you are a legend. I’m totes gonna do this over the coming weeks. Thank you so much for sharing!
this looks awesome. Will benchwatch it once I get home

That's a fun idea! I might try to do this with a large enough set of famous movie scenes. Should be fun, but kinda hard to gather the dataset.
