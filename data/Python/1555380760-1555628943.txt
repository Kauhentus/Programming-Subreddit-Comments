Thank you for the answer, it was very helpful!
Python Anywhere has a free plan that might work for you.
If it's just one user why do you need flask at all? Just use something like kivy for the UI.
Ramnode has some really low spec vps for about $16 a year, or at least that's what I paid when I renewed mine just a few days ago.

I'm making a model similar to word2vec, so I need to read in large amounts of text. The numba part doesn't actually do much with the strings, mainly just trains the corresponding neural network. Numba is very good at doing this quickly, and can easily do stuff in parallel (I wanted it to handle different batches from the text generator in parallel) What I may do is just handle the text generator outside of numba, which is not ideal, but maybe the best I can do. Do you have any suggestions on what else could be done here?
Heroku is free beyond 12 months and GCP has an [“always free” tier](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier). Beyond that, if your app is geared to support a phone app, I would imagine it mostly serves JSON. If so, consider switching it to a Lambda app and you’ll find [the costs](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/) ridiculously low due to their generous free tier.
Try https://pypi.org/project/libscrc/ I've not used it but it looks straight forward.
I actually never heard of Kivy, how does it differ from Flask? My app basically interacts with a sqlite db and flask just provides interaction via a web server frontend.
It figuratively, not literally, drew the line.
Where is it installed? They like sticking it in ProgramData these days. You don’t have write permission to that folder.
holy crap, I never knew Lambda free tier was that generous. If I convert my app to lambda, what would you recommend for a frontend to connect to lambda via the phone?
File location : user/appdata/local/... I do have permission to that folder.
Thanks!
You’re probably missing a DLL. Add prints and read the pyinstaller warnings. Fix the warnings.
as the bot has told you before, these kinds of questions are better suited in the /r/learnpython sub
Okay
Atom freezes for me. It'll give me the "Editor not responding" popup at least 5 times before I can use it. And when that happens every time, yeah I'm not using Atom. Sad as that is.
I have a 2 year old (maybe 3-4?) computer, running Windows 10, with a 900 GB hard (technically 1000 GB), and 4 GB of memory. Like I said, my computer's getting a bit old, and I'm on it constantly, although I try to limit my use.
I've checked Emacs out. I like the UI of it, but have NO knowledge of Lua or how to install plugins :/
Atom takes like 5 minutes to load, and when it does load, it will say "Editor not responding" at least 5 different times, and it usually happens each time I load up Atom. I'm pretty patient sometimes, but that can be a pain when I want to use the editor right away.
Could be. I've got a lot of downloads, and other programs, on my computer. I do clean it regularly, and that speeds it up somewhat.
Thanks for the wonderful suggestions, everyone! I've decided to try learning vim, and I have a few Vim-based text editors to try out! I'll let you know how that experiment goes.
I'm super curious to know more about what you're doing because I've never been able to do anything with a string in numba faster than in cPython, let alone pypy. (I work in genetics). I don't have any suggestions without knowing more.

Really enjoyed "Automate The Boring Stuff" by Al Sweigart
a few things made me go "wow!" in my head just now. 1) to anakin: wow! you used a phone to learn programming? pepole really do find smart phones useful. or im old. (and im \~30 so perhaps not aging gracefully). 2) i came here bc i did not get a BSinCS. (its a BSinSomeOtherBS). and just to throw it out there, I used a "shotgun/bruce-lee" approach of amassing many sources and taking the good from each. in practice that meant going through many really easy things if I felt stuck and having a couple (or one) foundational course/book i was struggling with. 2.0.1) in a practical sense tho, racket was my first lang and HtDP (how2designprogs) was the book. 3) was happy to see \`C\` on the list. (Im finding myself tempted to say a phrase that turns me off a great deal about "internet gurus". so im not gonna say that in order to be a snek jedi one must C bc py is written in C, and if one were to want to master some black magics/dark arts/voodoo/incantations&amp;chants one may want to dig into sneksauce). nothing was stated. &amp;#x200B; 1) to refto: i dont understand. im not afraid of breaking convention for logical or even (tbh mainly) aesthetic reasons. but doing what you have shown there. it breaks many things. and it seems with no justification. thats violence for the sake of violence. makes me sad.

I consolidated all the 5 different .py files into one single big file and ran the pyinstaller After that the exe threw 2 errors when run using the CMD 1. Portaudio lib not found To rectify this I added the portaudio lib to the system environment variables and then added a portaudio.dll file also to the system path 2. Sndfile missing error There were lot of steps to rectify this but all I did was to copy _soundfile_data ( which is present in the /path/site-packages/_soundfile_data ) Copied all the contents of it into the dist folder of the created exe file After doing all the above steps the exe executed successfully Thanks for everyone who has been of help to me ... Arigato From Still a clueless programmer !
Sure! If you’re not married to Python and would also consider JavaScript, FireBase has a [decent free tier](https://firebase.google.com/pricing/) and a large number of apps use it.
Wait i just saw this web assembly thing Could this enable web development in python if a compiler to wasm is made?
You definitely want something other than `asyncio.queue`. It's not meant to share data across processes. `multiprocessing.queue` can do that, but it's not async, so you would need a lot of overhead to get it running. Tools like Redis, Nats.io, RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ, or even a database should work. All of these have libraries with support for asyncio, see https://github.com/aio-libs for a large selection. But it ultimately depends on your goals and needs. So before settling on a technology, you should answer yourself these questions: * what you want to achieve? * Is there even a reason to have multiple processes? * Is there a specific reason to use asyncio? * Do you need queue persistence or requeue capabilities?
Super interesting, especially for someone new like me. Have you posted this to r/learnpython as well?
I'm from the same background as you and I've been absolutely tearing through the Deep Learning [Fast.ai](https://Fast.ai) course by Jeremy Howard. The idea is that you achieve "cool" things first with code, and then double back and understand the maths and thinking behind the code. &amp;#x200B; For me, this approach is far far superior and provides a decent dopamine reward for creating cool little solutions motivating you to continue learning (rather than dry maths heavy lectures for hours on end).
Awesome glad it could help. Just did!
Hey, thanks :) I originally wanted to create PDF reports too. But then I noticed that it is much harder too make a PDF compared to Html. And Html suits my purposes as well. But it would be possible to add a PDF renderer, I'm open for pull requests.
Not even talk about kernels nor CV nor test sets...... Stop treating ML like just another Python library
Mhh. It minimizes via optimization...
Literally no mention of Kernels which is the defining quality of an SVM
I'm confused, the whole thing is written in rust.
Depending on your level it can often be not much more complicated than that, There are hundreds of reasons that Python3 is better than Python2, not the least of which is Python2 is [retiring in 8 months](https://pythonclock.org/) but for the beginner, print() covers a lot.
The extension uses the Wasmer runtime (https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer). Everything is written in Rust.
Yes that’s an extension for Python written in Rust to run WebAssembly programs :-).

It depends. Wasm is a cross-platform executable binary format. You can write Rust, C, C++, AssemblyScript, everything that compiles to Wasm. Then you can run your Wasm program in your browser for instance, or on a server, and now within Python. WebAssembly is by design and by definition safe since it runs in a controlled sandbox. The access to the host or the system is controlled, by default there is no access. The goal is to run Wasm at native speed. We are close to it. The Python extension uses the Cranelift backend which provides a good balance between compilation and execution time. We might add support for LLVM, which brings a slower compilation time but a very fast execution time (as fast as native). The Wasm extension uses the Wasmer runtime (https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer), which supports 3 backends: Single pass, Cranelift and LLVM. It’s a matter of turning one backend on and one off. But LLVM isn’t available on all platforms whilst Cranelift is written in Rust and is more easily embeddable.
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) is a scientific Python distribution which includes Spyder and is now the de facto standard for scientists (besides stock Python). The best way to deal with multiple Python versions is via virtual environments, easily managed with either conda or virtualenv.
I'll start by saying--this question probably belongs in r/learnpython \--even though you're not really learning python it is a more suitable forum for these types of questions. As for your questions. 1. I'm not really familiar with python(x,y) but Anaconda may be a substitute on some fronts. Anaconda essentially comes with a lot of the numerical and scientific packages and helps in managing them on your machine. It also comes with Jupyter notebooks which tends to be the goto now for doing a lot of scientific-y things and graphing stuff. For graphing there are options--plotly, matplotlib, bokeh--they all have their strengths and targets/wheel houses. 2. Python 2.7 and Python 3.x, 3.y, 3.z, etc. can exist fine on a single OS. In fact if you're on Linux you probably really don't want to even thing about messing with the /usr/bin/python version as there are probably some stuff that still relies on it. Beyond that how you want to manage various versions of python (and yes you can have more than 2) is really up to how you want to. Anaconda is essentially a self contained installed version. Depending on the OS you can install various versions and set your path or \~/bin/ version to whatever. For pip it may be common to have a pip2 and a pip3 command (or the one you prefer as just pip) then also have pip3.5, pip3.6 etc. However, if you want to make your life easier in the long run you really, really, really need to use venv or virtualenv. Unfortunately on that front there are a bunch of options that really depend on what you want to accomplish--but until you have some opinion (or are forced to have an opinion) I'd suggest just using virtualenv (and potentially add virtualenvwrapper as a helper). \[Then again anaconda will actually do virtual environments--I just think if you are planning on getting back into python getting your fingers a bit dirty in the venv world helps a lot down the road.\] 3. I think I answered--in a rambling way--much of this with answer 2--but yes you can run scripts with python2 [file.py](https://file.py) when you need to specify. For one of scripts and things that will work fine--but for anything bigger it gets back to virtualenvironments where the python version is set by the env. So in short--A) give anaconda a spin for a quick start on whats out there and an easy way to get python 3 running along with your version 2. B) Try out the jupyter notebook(s) while you have anaconda. And C) Do a google search for python virtual environments to find some howtos and explanations. (I again think "virtualenv" plus "virtualenvwrapper" are great starting points on that front but there are other options and you may actually just get all you need from anaconda.) Final note: I'm actually not a heavy user of anaconda--but I do think it is really good if you just want to mess around with some python stuff. I do use it on windows as sort of a quick way to do environments and jupyter notebooks for testing stuff but spend most of my time in venvs on linux or using Visual Studio.

Am I understanding this right, this is for running wasm serverside or on your own PC and not in the web?
Wait, didn't you work on that last week? Might be time for a cost/benefit analysis ;-)
We have been hearing about wasm for a long time now, how could we benefit currently from it?
&gt; Oh God no! Why? No! 1k is pretty much the maximum that is readable code. Not all source code people interact with is "readable". You don't want an editor that only functions for readable code. Multi-thousand line files show up routinely in real world projects. [Here's](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/youtube_dl/extractor/youtube.py) [some](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/youtube_dl/utils.py) python examples from a well-known and popular project. [Here's](https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/blob/master/lib/CodeGen/SelectionDAG/DAGCombiner.cpp) a C++ example from a well-known and popular project. This one is 20k lines. Is that ideal? Definitely not. Do I want to have to spin up an entirely different editor if I have to touch this file? Also definitely not.
Yes it’s WebAssembly on the server side or within your favorite language :-).

There is many use cases actually. To name a few: Cross-platform distributable Python extensions, selectively boost some parts of your application with any languages that compile to Wasm, share code between a client and a server, safe and secure sandboxes to execute any programs etc. Wasm is a new playground!
everything is possible

Man you are truly a narcissist person, and you are trying to get rich the fastest you can, the company is not my uncle's and not related to me in any way, also i found the community of MetaTrader they create bots for the range of 30-200$ and its secure, and efficient, what you are trying to do is, make the maximum money out of something people are getting paid for a decent amount, what you wanna be a partner too in the company?! Stop lying you are neither good nor you van do it! Show me your portfolio of work. Show me what you can do, stop all your bullshit, and start show me a small project you worked on. Scam artist?! Even if i wont do this, I'm already working on three different project for my company, and this said i don't give q fuck about your overpriced offer, stop lying and stop asking for monstrous amount of money for doing 0 work.
Excel does accept it, but it needs the '=' before to know its a formula, I just assume it's always a formula. Good second point, I just named it after the handsontable formulaparser which inspired it and then went with it without thought in the project descriptions. I should probably change the project description to be more accurate so people know this can actually evaluate excel formulas.

Hey, thanks for your reply! To answer your question: It is more for research than for trading. But the research will then ultimately be used for trading and further idea generation. Meaning: I backtest certain strategies and setups. If those strategies and setups prove to be profitable, I need to find stocks that fit those specific setups and strategies. Thats where the algorithm would come in. As stated in my original post, I would like the algo to scan the market, looking for specific setups of stocks and then notify me. I will then look at those setups and might **manually execute a trade** after some further analysis.

&gt; WebAssembly is by design and by definition safe since it runs in a controlled sandbox. Wasm makes impossible some attacks (many important ones), but not all. So it is better not to call it "safe by definition".
Working on a year in picels webapp using flask that tracks your mood, acitivities, the weather and what youre eating to make recommendations on what to do/eat to cheer you up.
&gt; Could this enable web development in python if a compiler to wasm is made? You could do that already before Wasm (and it has been done): either you compile an existing Python interpreter to JS or Wasm; or you create some kind of transpiler Python-to-JS (or to Wasm). The problem is that there is not much to gain from doing so, except re-using your Python skills/code. On the downsides, you introduce complexity, reduce performance, makes debugging harder, etc. In the end, people simply choose JS, TS, CS or similar languages instead. What people want Wasm for is to use systems languages instead, because from those we can actually gain a lot of performance compared to JS.
As much as we like to mock ourselves, python makes it particularly easy to build test harnesses and learn through experimentation or reading the source.

It‘s one of the features I love most about Python. I don‘t even need StackOverflow that often, I just read the docs, fire up an interpreter and experiment with the things that are not quite clear to me. Such a nice workflow, basically zero overhead to just try modules / classes/ functions and adapt your code accordingly.
I’m a Python newbie. So far the only thing I’ve learned from StackOverflow is that a *whole* bunch of questions are closed for what seem to be fairly arbitrary reasons, particularly ‘unclear’ questions that are perfectly clear to me but perhaps not clear to people who’ve forgotten what’s it like to be a newbie. It’s even more frustrating to find the exact question you want an answer to but see it voted closed based on the assumption that it’s too niche to help people other than the guy who originally asked it.
I haven't used SO in years. You reach a point in your career where your problems are so specialised that if you ask the question they will close it as too localised, and even just asking the question becomes a major and time consuming problem.
Fortunately Python also has pretty good documentation. But yeah, this is what I tell people who are worried about not "knowing enough" programming.
We all have to face nightmares sometime in our life.
So.. Maybe I am the odd one but I actually never use Stackoverflow. It's a messy place filled with pedantic pricks.
I wish Google had an option to archive/filter old SO threads when I search. Python changes so much so quickly that the top results are often littered with outdated and obsolete solutions. That's the biggest issue I run in to.
Ha! Well, I'd still be a programmer...just one without one of his most used resources :(
Where's the source code?
What if i told you, it can be simply downloaded? look for dash [https://kapeli.com/dash](https://kapeli.com/dash)
It do be like that
Damn that last point is true. "Hi, I'm trying to do x, but getting y problem. Any suggestions?" "First of all, are you an idiot? Why would you ever, *ever* do it this way? Quit now, moron" "Oh, okay."
You should stop using poor people's Google, my returns as the very first result gor "pyttsx3 save file" the following: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39014468/how-to-save-the-output-of-pyttsx-to-wav-file
&gt;You should stop using poor people's Google, my returns the following as the very first result for "pyttsx3 save to file": "espeak" in not what I'm interested in on this moment :(
StackOverflow had so much promise early on but was overrun with the worst pedantry. It became a place where toxic assholes indulged their desire to nitpick to ruinous ends.
You could do a turtle sign writer, user types their name into command line turtle draws it in big sign like lettering, you'd have to code a default for each letter and get it to reset for each letter, would be a fun little one. That said if they are kids get ready for turtle spelling out bad words :)
Kivy is a UI framework. There's a build system for it that can create iOS and Android apps. It would be a complete replacement for Flask.
It's even worse with Unreal Engine. they need to figure out how to show a search engine that the question is unanswered.
I don't about that, most of the search results I get these days aren't stackoverflow related at all. Stackoverflow becomes kind of useless once you actually ask for anything complicated on it, or anything that is likely to change (aka: literally anything library related), or anything that has any degree of complexity to it, because it'll usually overlap ever so slightly with different posts, making people mark it as duplicate, or it'll be hard to understand making it marked as vague, or it'll be opinion based making it marked as opinion based. I'm pretty sure I don't need stackoverflow, and if I just filtered it out of my search results, I'd be just fine without it, as far as programming goes anyways. If anything, most of the time I'll avoid it. I've been learning Emacs recently and it's just unbelievable how useless stackoverflow has been, with great majority of the content comming out as outdated or too specific to be useful for what I'm trying to do, leading me to turn to documentation instead or just add "reddit" to my search query, which turns up quite a few duplicate posts, all with their own opinions, making it easier to understand what I need to do next.
I'm a fan of http://automatetheboringstuff.com/ but maybe something like scratch would be more interactive: https://scratch.mit.edu/ good luck
Try \`hug\`
If I [understood correctly](https://pyttsx3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/support.html) it ships and use either espeak, or nsss in Mac OS and nsss for Windows. Do you need a sapi5 solution?
Yeah, and there's functions.php in WordPress. None of that will be done by someone learning to code, and basic developer rights should be enforced to avoid dealing with such horrors.
What's the overhead of calling into a WASM Binary compared to a normal C shared library? Will this become "the new way" to write Rust extensions for Python?
It's kind of hard to understand you. but... In `for` loop `i` is evaluated after you accessed it and if you don't have a `break` or `continue` statement under it (and before `i` statement) then all the members of `l` will be evaluated. The same goes with `while` loop for every `i` smaller than `SIZE`.

You probably run this code in a loop and kind of not noticing that None line in printed output, change your code to something like following and so locate the source of the error: import sys try: table_rows = table.select('tbody tr') except AttributeError: print(some_variable_identifying_the_table_parent) sys.exit(1) for table_row in table_rows: ...
Yes because you explicitly evaluated all of them by your `i`, respectively `l[i]` statement.
This weekend i was working on a scraper for the site [4anime.to](https://4anime.to), you can download all episodes, a specific episode, print info of a show, print the recently added shows episode or print the popular shows of this week in the console. it can download all the episodes multi threaded where you can even specify how many threads you want to use. &amp;#x200B; [4anime.to scraper github](https://github.com/stefanfortuin/4anime.to-scraper)
Thanks.
Take a look at this package [https://github.com/DeepHorizons/tts](https://github.com/DeepHorizons/tts), you may use it or check its code.
Why do you want Idle? There are much better options available.

I use the command line tool `ddgr` to search DuckDuckGo, and I'm guessing I could just add this to my `.bashrc` to exclude stackoverflow: alias ddg="ddgr '-site:stackoverflow.com -site:stackexchange.com '" The `-` before a search word means that it'll be excluded, and it works if you do it manually every time obviously, but that would be a bit of a pain.
What does this do I’m a noob?
For just getting started in machine learning, I'd recommend this book, which is free and easy to understand: [http://www-bcf.usc.edu/\~gareth/ISL/](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) Along with this git repository which has the examples worked through in Python: [https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python)
I just published the source code of a markov chain bot framework. https://github.com/PhantomInsights/comments-generator With this project you can create primitive chat bots trained from the users and subreddits you like. All source code is commented and the article inside is very detailed on all the steps.
It's really interesting. This is the kind of answer I was looking for. Thank you.

I don't use R at all, therefore I didn't \^\^
Mainly because Automate the Boring Stuff suggests using IDLE and I'd rather just have it even if I don't use it. I was checking out Sublime or Atom but I'd still rather have IDLE anyways.

French uses coma as decimal separator. Thus, semi colon are use as separator. With that localization, the statement SUM(1;2;3) is correct.
This weekend is going to be a long weekend for me. I'm going to try to fix some bugs in my Python editor (https://github.com/JaDogg/expressPython: I wrote this in C++/Qt5 and embedded Python) and Perhaps figure out a way to create an app package for MacOS. I also want to create a distraction free text editor for my wife. I might do it with wxPython.
most of the time they are right, but the problem is that they never tell you what's the proper way to do that. Even then, the likelihood that you can actually reimplement your company's code to actually agree with the best practice is close to zero.
IDLE causes so many problems. Why don't they deprecate it?
How is it different from other python libraries for creating Telegram Bot especially [python-telegram-bot](https://python-telegram-bot.org/)?
Sorry for the late response. It was a general question. I suppose what I meant was how can I HTTBase settings in Django easily. I'm trying making a restaurant menu app which is connected to a database (this as I explained is part of the course)
I'm working on a DIY repair and upgrade of an old [Orbix electronic puzzle](http://twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pkey=901) I had when I was a kid. I'll replace the electronics with a small esp8266 board running pycopy (micropython), some RGB ws2812 led, an an accelerometer (just in case, might be cool). Those will allow me to integrate more puzzle than the original Orbix. For the moment the following are planned: - [the lumination problem](http://twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pkey=1173) that involved the previous move into the logic, - a 4-color map coloring puzzle. - If you got idea feel free to tell me :p I have currently done most of it on breadboard, fitting everything properly into the original thing will be the trickiest part ! I have a lot of experience with embedded C, this is my first try at using a python on small embedded device. I think I won't go back !! Not public yet, but definitively will be when more polished.
How can you ... what? Sorry, can you rephrase that?
"Safe by intention" is probably a better phrase.

Awesome! Thanks, again!
The goals have been the first things to be set, of course. In this specific case of mine, a Queue would a very elegant and seamless approach. However, in the lack of it, I will keep with what I have: One process (asynchronous) waits for a json file within a folder (if it finds it, it sends the data to other method and goes back to wait for other json file) and the other process (synchronous) puts the json file there, within that folder. It has to be this way, because the asynchronous process will run forever, while the synchronous process creates jobs for that, inserting new initialization data on the go, by a manual docopt interface. Thank you very much for taking your time and trying to help.
You can now compile your C code to WASM and run it on your server through this python extension! Wait...

I just started learning python. Can this be used to automate taking backups from a gui instead of a cli?
Great topic and interview, but one of the guest's bass is too strong. Gotta clean that up.
i am transitioning from Javascript to Python today
I'm back to work on a project that was in hibernation for a while: Aki, a simple programming language that uses Python and the `llvmlite` library. * GitHub: https://github.com/syegulalp/Akilang * Official blog (still minimal): http://aki.genjipress.com * Quick demo movie (outdated but fun -- this was from the original incarnation of the project) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vZ4oFCFOl8 I've been doing a lot of internal neatening up and rethinking (e.g., rewriting the lex/parse modules), and implementing the beginnings of a pointer type.
No I’ve never installed anything else related to programming, I recently installed the OS fresh.
? I’m not sure what you’re saying
Thank you for making this. I've wanted a cross-platform alternative to DeepSkyStacker for a while (it's Windows only and doesn't work properly in Wine), this looks very promising. I even started making one myself (to learn Python) before I discovered this. Btw. I just submitted a pull request with some GUI optimisations
The other posters already explained, but don't worry it's fine to use commas as well.
What are the best python libraries to learn in order to do data-analyst work? This includes but not limited to ( ML, stats, visualization, etc )
"Modification of mysql\_config resolves these issues as follows." Yes you do as it says. Modify mysql\_config. Edit this file the way it tells you to edit it.
Super, thanks for that. I was just assuming it was some sort of binary, as Finder describes at as a "Unix Executable". But good old text-edit did the trick.
I remember the nursery rhyme a little differently
I thought you just meant ‘woo!’
I have the exact same problem right now. This seems to be the only library where you can set the language that I have found so far, but you can't safe it. If someone can not solve this issue. Can someone provide a solution for setting the voice like shown AND saving it?
I used Atom a couple of times. Never any problems, quite fast to start up. I'm regularly using VSCode though. It's everything that atom is, but sightly faster and more features. I've never had a case where VSCode would have any performance issues, except when I was running the equivalent of furmark at the same time.
We can finally run c code on servers
Continuing work on a script to help make my ereader more useful to me by taking pdfs, searching for their source latex files, and reformatting them into mobi or epub formats. It's an ugly bodge thus far, and it doesn't even work start to finish yet. But the pieces are starting to fall into place. The pipeline currently wraps and calls (or soon will) htlatex: to convert latex to html, calibre: to convert html to e reader formats, and inkscape: to convert graphs exported as pdfs to svg.
this isn't an installation issue. you need to load the image differently

Wasm doesn't make unsafe languages safe, but it avoids a large set of attacks. I recommend this reading, [https://00f.net/2018/11/25/webassembly-doesnt-make-unsafe-languages-safe/](https://00f.net/2018/11/25/webassembly-doesnt-make-unsafe-languages-safe/).
“the new way”, I have no idea, but “another way”, probably. Let's see! That would be exciting :-).
Okay, interesting! Are you looking to eventually interpret all the coercions too? `="1"+2` for example?
Check this out: [https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/hub\_with\_keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/hub_with_keras)
The extension is developed with [pyo3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3), which relies on the FFI API of Python.
WebAssembly is a new cross-platform binary format. You can for instance create a Rust, or C program, compile it to WebAssembly, and run it in your favorite browser, or on the server, and now within Python. You can learn more by reading https://webassembly.org/. You can also check Lin Clark's blog posts on https://hacks.mozilla.org/category/webassembly/, they are just awesome :-).
Completed the form. Thank you very much.
How does this compare to the one posted yesterday? [https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/bdn7ij/wasmer\_a\_python\_extension\_to\_run\_webassembly/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/bdn7ij/wasmer_a_python_extension_to_run_webassembly/)
In the same way that numpy is a python library mainly written in C/C++. Except that Rust is good, and C/C++ are, at best, necessary evils.

You mean ctypes? That's a shame because it means to use it in PyPy you have to rely on the ctypes emulation

Can’t post images there
They have rules to handle this situation [which can be found under the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq), specifically you describe the issue you're having, post the code involved, and the output of any related error message. You'll also have to format your code correctly as is explained under the [FAQ: How do I format code?]( https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) (Be mindful of which version of reddit you're using) As is from this post the behavior looks correct, so you'll need to explain what you think your code is doing. This combined with posting your source code will help others understand what is going wrong (avoid posting login info during this step). This is why /r/learnpython only allows self posts: it helps force clarity when asking questions.
You can use PyCharm outside of the US? VIm, Atom, Notepad++, Eclipse Also, find your own taste, blah, blah, all the stuff that's been said in the other threads.
Why don't you just use the Community version of PyCharm?
This is the link I'm scraping versions of (just changing the year, length if necessary): url_to_scrape = 'https://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;stats=bat&amp;lg=all&amp;qual=10&amp;type=8&amp;season=2018&amp;month=0&amp;season1=2018&amp;ind=0&amp;team=&amp;rost=0&amp;age=&amp;filter=&amp;players=&amp;page=1_740' And this is what's been working till yesterday: r = requests.get(url_to_scrape) soup = BeautifulSoup(r.text,'html') cell_list = worksheet.range('A3:DI3') i = 3 k = 3 table = soup.find("table", { "id" : "LeaderBoard1_dg1_ctl00" }) print(table) batters = [] for table_row in table.select('tbody tr'): cell_list = worksheet.range('A{}:DI{}'.format(i, k)) print('Setting cell_list to worksheet.range({}:{}\n)'.format(i, k)) batter = {} print('Searching table_row for td\n') table_cells = table_row.findAll('td') if table_cells: print('starting scrape for data...') #player name cell_list[0].value = table_row.find('a').text # team try: cell_list[1].value = table_row.find_all('a')[1].text except: cell_list[1].value = 'None' #relative_link to player relative_link = table_cells[1].find('a')['href'] It started giving me the buffering error recently, but now it's not doing that. It's also stopped printing the table that was printing fine this morning. What I've been doing is iterating through this page to get the names, teams, and player links, then I used those links to get the individual data I need.

Who has dreaded seeing the very uninformative "SyntaxError: invalid syntax"? I'm working on a project that aims to create "friendly tracebacks", intended mostly for beginners but also for those who could benefit from explanations provided in their own language if it is not English. (This part will require people to contribute translations.) You can see what these look like by going straight to the middle of the documentation: https://aroberge.github.io/friendly-traceback/docs/html/tracebacks_en.html This is very much just the beginning of a project which I hope others will find useful - once it is "completed".
Nice introduction! This is a little off-topic, but does anyone know if there are open-source efforts to make a django/python reverse compiler, that takes static html and css and spits out the code in python? I feel more comfortable writing pages in html and css, but I love the concept of having python handle the active components of web pages, especially since you can't hide code or keep applications robustly proprietary with javascript. It would be great if someone made a framework that allowed pasting of css/html5 code into a box that then spit out the python code. I'm sure it wouldn't work 100% of the time, but it would still save time even if it required debugging and only got 80% of the page right. I'm always tinkering with the html, and I want to blindly cut-and-paste html changes into code.
Nice work. You might want to fix your url: there's an extra colon appended.

**Hosts (file)** The computer file hosts is an operating system file that maps hostnames to IP addresses. It is a plain text file. Originally a file named HOSTS.TXT was manually maintained and made available via file sharing by Stanford Research Institute for the ARPANET membership, containing the hostnames and address of hosts as contributed for inclusion by member organizations. The Domain Name System, first described in 1983 and implemented in 1984, automated the publication process and provided instantaneous and dynamic hostname resolution in the rapidly growing network. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

I think OP means these coding challenges people do sometimes
Think of small projects. Start with a web crawler. Learn how to make requests, look up the requests library and try to understand it. Look up python modules (probably start with standard library). Look into networking with python and build tcp and udp ports. Learn about manipulating strings with python. There are a few tricks that you can only do in python and it's really cool. Learn about manipulating files and their content, as well as navigating a system using python and the os modulo. Python is askari for four automation of tasks, so if you at your work do some mind numbing clicking, look into automating it with python. A good start would be selenium and chrome webdriver. Let me know if you have any questions. 😊
Or competitive collegiate/scholastic programming teams, which are absolutely a thing that some of us have been a part of
Let me add that the main obstacle to progress in any subject or task, at least in the current era, it's not lack of information or difficulty in accessing information, but lack of focus and a clear path. I speak for experience, sadly. I've been using python for at lest three years and I know next to nothing. If I had defined a clear path and learned as much as possible in a year I'd probably be getting doing something related. But hey, I'm on it now so don't lose focus.
Looks like WingIDE but smaller. Shoutout to Wing IDE as well especially for stack data.
I’m honestly not sure. Maybe ask that on r/cscareerquestions
Pushing some updates to [PyVM](https://github.com/ForceBru/PyVM). It can now run ELF binaries built for the `i386-unknown-linux-elf` target. I got some _very_ basic C standard library working as well. I also compiled a static binary that runs `musl` (an implementation of the C standard library), but it doesn't seem to work at the moment. I suspect some jumps got messed up.
you say it's for learning but it'll probably still help me in small non educational projects! I'll see if I can try it tomorrow
Hey, it's my book. I've had a copy since the German edition came out. &amp;#x200B; For those of you saying "I need this book," you should be aware of two things: a) it's all about Python 1.5.2; and b) it's not a very good book. But knock yourself out. &amp;#x200B; The original English title is "Teach Yourself Python in 24 Hours." Metta, Ivan
I initially built this for using in Windows 7 about 4-5 years ago. Main reason was to have an input text box I can read using `sys.stdin` or `input()`. I was building lot of regexes and wanted to test stuff.
Exactly. What I meant is HackerRank, LeetCode, etc. Maybe I can change the wording to be clearer.

I built \`expressPython\` for testing and or solving programming problems (HackerRank ...). I personally had a good use for it. It is not meant to be a full featured IDE, hence no debugging or stack.
I never used python-telegram-bot, it’s more complete, but really more difficult, especially for beginners
How are you trying to solve the problem?
Although someone could make the program for you, as you requested, this probably isn't the best way. You will get the final answer, but you miss out on the problem solving, which is a key concept to programming. So instead I ask, what is it exactly that you're having problems with? Is it the actual code, or the maths? Do you know what a factorial is? Do you have enough knowledge of python to solve this?
good idea, definitely will
thanks!

I think you might be missing the template feature of Django. I can’t remember the last time I wrote code for the view in Python.
Yeah, but python is also written in C. I didn't realize rust could use python C libraries.
looks like spyder
So the one side runs a script and you pipe std[err/out] to the other side? Feels like the Python shell would be an easier solution, but if you learned something it wasn't a waste.
Maybe try Fira Code
I like Hack Nerd Font Mono!
this is pretty damn cool
really nice but does it have dark color scheme? lol
Oh yeah I’m sure. It looks good! It just definitely reminds me of wing due to your UI lib choice.
Thanks for answering. I didn't know that subreddit. The question has been asked over there a couple of times already. I personally don't aspire a career in computer sciences, I just wanted to make a suggestion for the OP.
It doesn't have to, in this instance. Although anything with C/FFI bindings can be used equally well from rust or python. What's happening here is that python is using foreign function interface (FFI) to call into a binary which is compiled from rust. The binary is just doing what python tells it to, then handing the results back up to python. Pyo3 figures out how to interconvert between python and rust objects where necessary.

What volume do you expect? [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/dev) is free for up to 1,000 calls/day, and then 10,000 calls/dollar after that.
A lightweight IDE is always nice. Going to go try it out! Thanks for making it.
Variables in Python are references . So when you did a=b, you just create another reference to the list instance referenced by b. Next you have changed list instance by reference. &amp;#x200B; For the next time i suggest you use r/learnpython/
\`a = b\` doesn't copy the list, it just creates another reference to it. As a result, \`a\` and \`b\` will always refer to the same list, and changing one will also change the other. If you want to copy the list, you'll want to do \`a = b.copy()\` instead. Also, /r/learnpython
/r/learnpython read the sidebar don't post pictures of code
Here is the code so you can try it yourself: b = [0,0,0,0] print(b) a = b for n in [0,1,2]: a[n] = 1 print(b)
Wow
Sorry. I saw a pic of code on the hot page, so I assumed it was allowed.
I have a small VPS with virmach that is like $6/year for 1c and 256mb of ram. Price goes up from there.
Pretty much pandas and numpy.
python is not the right tool for this
&gt;Nice la are you from Malaysia?
Dude, I think your python is broken. You should take it back to wherever you bought it and get a refund.
/r/learnpython is much more appropriate for this kind of post.
Yup... I could be wrong but I think the site existed before Alexa the assistant... and Amazon bought it? I gotta research that actually... could definitely be wrong

Lol ok I get it. It's a rookie mistake. I've been programming with C++ for years so I thought I could switch over to python no problem.

VS Code can essentially do the same thing to my knowledge. You can do live share with someone else and you can also run python from within VS code using code runner/python preview. It also has built in user snippets which I recently learned how to use and it's life changing.
I dont see why python isnt the right tool for this. I built an inventory program in python using sqllite. I even built a GUI on top of it with tKinter.
Glad you took it in the spirit in which it was intended. Just busting your chops a little bit. Stick with it on Python. I've worked in all kinds of languages over the last couple decades, and the last 18 months or so working with Python have been really fun. It's a great language for proofing an idea fast. Python has become my language of choice faster than I could have imagined.
"Even if one person enters information incorrectly" Define incorrectly; you should be doing user input validation to ensure anything the user enters is at least valid, it may not be accurate information but it will be the correct format for the database. Also, only the inserted or updated entry would be an issue, not the whole database, if someone were to put in inaccurate information.
PM me if you have any issues. I just recently moved from Paperspace (paid IaaS) to my own linux box at home - but I believe with Google Colab, etc now you can do most of it with little expense.
That happens to me sometimes. I'll be thinking about something oddly specific in Python and come on here and within 30 seconds find what I was thinking about without even looking for it. It's weird. Sometimes i'll be thinking about a product or something and then see an ad for it lol. I know it's coincidental but it feels weird when it happens.
I don't see how it's confusing at all.
https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-django-project.html if you have a couple dollars and want extra fancyness. Otherwise pycharm community edition is pretty good even without the Django extras.
Yep, good explanation
Nice
Why do you think you need an IDE?
I'm working on a project to create a strong-motion seismometer using an accelerometer, arduino (technically just the atmega chip, but I used the IDE), and maybe a raspberry pi (although I have an old laptop on standby if the pi can't handle the load). Right now I can read accelerometer data via serial and write that to a file using python, and I'm working on a script to take that data, clean it up, and output a spectrogram and acceleration vs time graph for each axis. My next goals include automatically setting the timestep for the spectrogram based on the data, pulling out interesting (high acceleration, known earthquakes) sections of the data to save on compute time, automating all of the above, and just generally tightening up my code. This is the first project I've used python for (prior projects have mostly been with matlab and a bit of Processing) and I'm really liking it.
When you say without sudo, do you mean the restricted shell will need to be able to limit actions on behalf of the user without access to sudo. Or are you and your teammates limited to non sudo access on the machine in question? If you have access to setup software on the system, I'd start looking at proxies like squid, the idea being that it sits between the internet and your user, and it can be configured programmatically afaik
Perfect... Thank you mind sir/ma'am

Currently I'm using Manjaro (based on Archlinux) for Python development. It's easy to setup, has everything in the repos and if that's not the case I still have the AUR. Maybe took a look at it?
Did you find a solution? I am still looking for one! Nsss didn’t seem to correctly create the files somehow.
Hmm Mint is my work OS (Python dev) and I've never had a problem. If you're using virtualenvs tho, you're starting from scratch each time, except Python itself and pip, unless you tell it to use site packages (not default). What are you installing that's leading you down a dependency tree?
Docker containers. Seriously, it completely decouples any garbage of having a computer set up a certain way, and it also maintains your dependencies in a traceable way. With that said, if you aren’t building apps, docker is definitely overkill. Having to spin up a container to run a script doesn’t sound like a fun experience.
Use hashlib, algorithms like md5 are universal and always the same for the string. There’s also murmur hash which you initialize with a seed and has less collisions than md5.

&gt; Does anyone know of any package like Python(x,y) but for Python 3 Anaconda is basically Python (x,y), but much better. Python packaging has also gotten a lot better for many of those scientific libraries in recent years, which kinda killed the need for it. &gt; I still have and won’t remove my Python 2.7. You're asking for pain by having two versions of python installed, but ya can, though you typically end up typing `C:\Python27\python.exe myscript.py`. Anaconda lets you create virtual environments with different versions of Python, so you really don't need to keep Python 2.7 as your main if you don't want. &gt; I’ve read about how people switch from Python 2.7 to Python 3 on their cmd windows. Some, simply rename the exe Python file from python.exe to python2.exe (and likewise for 3) and then call “python2 file.py” on their terminal. Would that work? What do you guys recommend? Again...asking for pain. What about the scripts like `C:\Python27\Scripts\pip install ...` or the other command line scripts. What about DLLs?
From your error, you clearly don't. I just moved an install of Anaconda the other day for a coworker. She had permissions if the permissions were elevated, but not by default. The permissions are not elevated by Anaconda.
The `engine` object has a `save_to_file` method. Can that not be used? I'm on mobile, but look at the [code in here] (https://github.com/nateshmbhat/pyttsx3/blob/master/pyttsx3/engine.py).
I wanted to know what a computer was and what you could fo with it. My first program, a 'Master Mind' game in basic, only ever existed on paper. I bought my first computer four years later.

There is a difference when you install packages from apt and pip. If possible always install from apt for stability. Most of the things you install via pip can be installed with apt. I've never had anything missing
Hire someone who has built one before. I’ve built one before. Hire me. Seriously, if the job is up for bids let me know.
1. Write some code. 2. Write more code. 3. Repeat.
From all the list of methods only ***save\_to\_file*** is unavailable.
Still work on it. Let me know, if you'll find it, please
Why, specifically?
This can certainly be done in Python. That said there are _many_ off the shelf solutions for barcodes asset tracking and inventory management, and just as many companies specializing in bespoke solutions for those rare industries to which off the shelf packages aren’t a good fit. **DO NOT** spend time reinventing a wheel that you can already purchase fully formed.
Oh, thanks!! It is working! On this stage it is enough for me. &lt;3

If I understood the project correctly: Mozilla Hacks team compiled Python and some crucial libraries(NumPy, Pandas, matlplotlib) to WebAssembly using emscripten’s compiler. Went through the example book and everything seemed to work quite nicely. I can see %% magic commands are adopted ala Jupyter. Nice for familiarity! Hopefully this project gets more love.
What do you mean by "unavailable"?

Future looking exciting for Python soon it will dominate the web development field.
Damn, I thought repl.it was the be-all-end-all.
I didn't see the post , reddit didn't warn me for posting again - weird
It's too late.
I'll be curious to see how it pans out
\&gt; It’s also been argued more generally that [Python not running in the browser represents an existential threat to the language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITksU31c1WY)—with so much user interaction happening on the web or on mobile devices, it needs to work there or be left behind. Doubt
When I read about web assembly, I prayed to the old gods and the new for something like this.

Same here, i'm just holding my breath for something to replace javascript
Web Assembly actually looks super cool to me.
I actually built this initially (2014) before first release of VSCode (2015). Even Atom on Windows 7 had issues back then if I remember correctly. Atom and VSCode is very stable and useful now.
That's sounds good.
I can get away from JavaScript finally
Notch: lol Python
It’s never tooo late to believeeeeeeee
Indeed. This is a cool project, but Python is in wide-spread and growing use, running in the browser is not what it's designed for and thus *not* running in the browser is no threat to it.
Is it possible to create Firefox extensions with this?
Where have you read that i need assistance in the first place ?! And what do u know about Algeria?! You insist that i'm a scam artist and you dont know shit about me?!?! I can send you proof of my studies certification if you want, i dont have a problem at all, what about you lying non stop about your capabilites?! I do have CISCO CCNA Certification, Full Stack Web Developer, Data Analysis etc i can show you proof without any hesitation! Because im a clean person what about you??? Lying non stop?!? And sharing informations and proving them will not kill you!? You avoid all my requests and i answered all yours, means you are the true SCUM not me, and also you dont know shit about Algeria, NOTHING, if so tell me some informations about it otherwise STFU and GO LIVE YOUR RETIREMENT LIFE/LUXURIOUS LIFE AWAY FROM ME, why are insisting in talking with me?! And provoking me non-stop?! You all are FULL OF HATE BEHIND YOUR SCREEN, Behind Your Keyboard, in Real life you are the biggest failure human kind ever saw. Fucking liar and fucking hater.
I did start with the text editor. I was trying to use textgenrnn to generate some suggestions but they are nonsense 😂

I'm wondering how performance compares to JavaScript. And on the other hand, perhaps this will mean performance gains for Python?
Maybe this vid will help you out: https://youtu.be/Mv9NEXX1VHc
I take it, thanks.
Maybe get a book from your local library.
The error says I need permission for User X.... But I am USer X. Some with an Admin access tried to delete it for me and it still said that it needed permission from User X.
Yes, please file an issue, I actually consider that a bug since both excel and the handsontable formulaparser can handle that.
Cool! What about things Excel accepts but the handsontable parser does not? There will be plenty of coercions the handsontable parser won't get (for a start, the coercions are locale-dependent...) Excel is really a horrible piece of software :)

I'd imagine if anything can get Python a JIT in the mainline it's this. Although sites today's highly optimized JavaScript interpreters are impressively slow anyway, because people put slow code on them. I think the python community can do better, even with performance as it is :P
It's 12 to 16 times slower according to my understanding of the article.
if that is not optimism right there; I do not know what is :)

decorators are advanced concept but very easy to understand if you get them. It is just syntactic sugar means just different representation. Same code you can write easily without them. if you want to modify function response without altering function itself, decorator are helpful. For Flask check this cookiecutter template - [https://github.com/rohitchormale/cookiecutter-flask-minimal](https://github.com/rohitchormale/cookiecutter-flask-minimal) Just run it and launch new project, you will get idea.
Frankly I'm not sure, I started the project last week, but I'm fine with hotxlfp accepting more stuff than the handsontable parser, I'm not fine with less.
If I'm not mistaken, this could violate WhatsApp's ToS. You should definitely read into ToS before considering automating an application that you do ont own and is shared by other people. ([https://www.whatsapp.com/legal](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal))
Even if it changed to python overnight, you'll have another 5-10 years before java script dies
Do you use TypeScript instead?
Python is growing, but Java/TypeScript remain the most widespread languages. If a scientific stack ever takes off in one of them, what advantage would Python retain? Case in point: The Jupyter UI is all written in Javascript. If you want to add custom widgets to a Jupyter Notebook, you *have * to use Javascript. If the flagship Python scientific stack has a front-end that isn’t in Python and can never be rewritten in Python, I take that as a sign something is wrong.
Fuck Notch tbh
I had something similar to learn and implement using some GUI with Python and my main use case is to teach Python regular expressions through it (I already have a book released on this: https://github.com/learnbyexample/py_regular_expressions) so, it would be something like an interactive book accessible via desktop instead of webapp/similar (kinda like https://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/thinkcspy/index.html) I checked the repo, seems it supports only Windows (so I cannot check it out as of now) - hopefully Linux is on the way.. if I am understanding this right, anyone will be able to create a custom learning environment with exercises/solutions/notes/etc right?
Yay, so now my browser can run like a dog then crash from all the ads written in Python ~~instead of~~ as well as ads written in Javascript.
Yeah, Python is your best bet for ML stuff right now. Also, if you're fluent with C++, forget the basics courses - just go read the [learnxinyminutes page for Python](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python3/) and then jump right into the ML stuff - [The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book](http://themlbook.com/wiki/doku.php) will give you the basic math background (assuming you're familiar with statistics in general), and you can start experimenting with TensorFlow or whatever from there.
 This feels like a pun, but I don't see it.
That's even more information than I had hoped for. Thank you sir! I'll jump right into that, when I get back home. Have a good day.
Yes you are correct
Can someone explain me what does this mean? (I am beginner in programming and I do mostly in Python)
That is actually really helpful thank you.
That's cool. It can be compiled to Mac and Windows (Only windows package is there for now), never tried to compile on a Linux yet but it might be possible as I'm not using any cross platform code. I used this for conducting a Python training session for some new graduates as well. There is a undocumented feature that allows you to load set of questions with a note, starting code and input and verify users changes by matching with output specified in the questions file.
At first i was like "that's jus a low-res image" but then I saw the numbers as well. Nice.
I am building a web portal for ordering of DSL lines and PSTN where required. Lots of django and some XML formatting for working with the major carrier's SOAP APIs.
It wouldn't be hard to build this with requests and just using a simple CRON. That said your algorithm might recognise different keywords to Google as you would essentially be trying to rebuild their indexing funtionality. You will run into the problems that people did in the 90s where people stuffed keywords into articles. You can get some ideas though I am sure.
&gt;but it might be possible as I'm not using any cross platform code oh ok, I don't know much about C++ I will possibly try it out this weekend &gt;conducting a Python training session for some new graduates yeah, that's another usecase, I conduct Python workshops as well, so something like this could serve as a single s/w needed + customized lessons/exercises based on workshop requirements
It's a start :p
It will allow you to compile Python code to WebAssembly
Don't accept any invitations to the launch party.
I'm not holding my breath...
Basic but simpke. Thanks
Will we soon see "6 billion devices run Python"?
So it can be done though legal stuff aside?
&gt;sorry for the slightly clickbait tittle I'm sorry for an offtopic, sincerely, but that's not a clickbait title, it's just a lousy one. Clickbaits are welcomed here in this sub, at least much more then lousy titles, but we users haven't evolved enough to replace the lousiness with them. NHF
I'm not ignoring legal stuff and neither should you.
Does this mean we will be able to use Python in place of JavaScript to manipulate the DOM on a web page? Or is this something else?
Look into web scraping with tools like Beautiful Soup and Selenium. I've written programs like this in the past. It's not too hard, and there are examples online
It’s hard to take an article that begins paragraphs with words like “well” and “firstly” seriously
so why exactly is this good?
Ah it actually outputs to an excel file. So these are all excel cells, from rows and columns. They're the bg color for each cell.
Let us hope someone will take pity on you and install an ad blocker.
That's just more room to improve!
Javascript isn't that bad anymore mate. It isn't gonna get replaced anytime soon. Wasm will probably compliment javascript for tasks that it is too slow for/can't do.
&gt; it avoids a large set of attacks That is precisely what I said, which isn't the same as "safe by definition". However, one remark: there are no safe languages. You are probably referring to memory-safety, which is tackled by the majority of programming languages out there for good reason, but that is only a subset of the problems.
I think you should go all the way: Buy a CNC knitting machine, create a public API for people to post project proposals, have them vote on the entries, have the machine knit the winner on a regular basis and create a script to auction the winning products. I'm kidding, of course, but that would be kind of awesome (and, yes, terrible because... Internet. You might want to include a manual review process to filter out the most outrages proposals.)
I think NLTK might have some functions for word extraction, tokenization, etc, Im not sure, though, if its any better than just doing it manually, splitting text and counting words
No disrespect to python, but it’s the last language I’d want being the language of the web. I think it’d be much better to have a strongly typed functional language like erlang, elixir, OCaml, or ReasonML (my personal choice) being the dominate language of choice. Good thing about webassembly though is that we might be able to use any language we want for the web
Python is really great for scientific computing, but currently any kind of computation you want done in the browser with python typically requires setting up an API (i.e. with flask) and doing the computation remotely. This allows your user's computer to execute and interact with the python code directly
ok
It’s not JavaScript that I don’t like about browser code, it’s manipulating the DOM elements... just not interesting to me. If Node wasn’t such a cesspool, I could get onboard doing more JavaScript. It’s a full featured high level programming language... but oh well.
Will it also be in my car?
Ok.
I wonder..will this bit of python have asynchronous nature. Did anyone hear?
thanks i will look into it
thanks for the tip man
hmm yeah, i will try to figure something out
it's probably already there
I legit think WebAssembly is going to completely change the way modern programing works. We will have pan-language package managers that let you install a Rust module, a go module, a node module, or Python in any one of those environments or the web.
you're right, it's not bad. it's atrocious, and a mistake which we should correct asap, and even forget it ever existed in the first place. &amp;#x200B; and don't forget to quietly dispose of front-end devs which now think they are "full stack" because they can launch node.
Seems like it would be good for a perimeter defense system as well (on a smaller scale).
I compiled a gameboy emulator I had written in C++ to webassembly and was surprised how well it worked and easy to setup
That is almost too good to be true. I'm keeping my hopes... conservative
Python is strongly typed.
Edited above comment. It should most probably work on Linux as I'm not using any platform specific stuff. (Qt is cross platform). Since I got it working on MacOS it should work on Linux as well. But on linux distribution might be a nightmare packages on Ubuntu/Fedora etc is different.
This is cool. Thanks for sharing.
it won't. it is explicitly not going to replace javascript
yeah, I don't think python fits the web model that well, elm, reason and others functional and declarative languages fit the Dom way better than python, even closure fit it better. python is awesome, but not in a hundred years I would choose it for frontend development.
[Oh shit it's finally happening.](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript) Everything will run in a web browser.
I also would like to know this. I recently heard about someone using Python to manipulate the DOM.
thanks, I'm looking forward to sharing more after a hiatus. Thanks for the encouragement.
Scientists in other fields than computer science is is still staying at MATLAB because of its ease-to-use. Python is slowly changing that, but I think you'll struggle to find many mathematicians who are willing to move away from python's easy syntax, so I doubt Java/Typescript will overtake it in that arena in the near future.
ad blocking binary wasm blobs will be way harder than js. Well at least I'll be annoyed and tracked by "high" performance code...
then we better get started
As someone who has more or less avoided JavaScript for the past 20 years, I have to ask: what's changed? I guess my biggest complaint with JS in the past was that it seemed like the worst of high-level and low-level merged into one. It was like a low-level language in that you needed third-party libraries to get anything done, but like a high-level language in terms of actual control and performance. Granted, part of the struggle was making it integrate with CSS and the DOM, which is not really JavaScript's fault per se. If web-Python doesn't do that better it'll be a drag, too. My experience is limited and woefully outdated, so I'm open to being educated.
Works great - could you add a simple text file database for profiles already visited? If you place only 1 keyword, it visits the same people over &amp; over again.
If the data is visible to you as a human, then its visible to a machine.
As technology improves, our expectations of performance remain stagnant. So we put those gains into reducing development cost and time instead., and give users something that's almost as responsive as what they used 20 years ago. The time you save when you don't optimize code like it's 1999 is immense, and as code gets more complex, optimization becomes disproportionately more complex. See also: every major OS, Microsoft Office, iTunes, and the very existence of Electron.
This kind of attitude helps nobody. Especially yourself.
Honestly, that's good enough for me to whip up proof-of-concept UIs and simple tools. I wouldn't build a major site with it, but I'm still kind of psyched.
Does this mean that Mozilla/Firefox will become the de facto choice for Jupyter Notebooks?
Typescript is just JavaScript with extra steps.
[removed]
It's not slavery! It's modified work!
Yes. I get that. You have to elevate the permissions. Kinda like when you install a program and Windows asks you if you’re sure. If you don’t click yes, you personally are not granting admin access even though you can grant admin access.
How is it from scratch if you're using pandas and sklearn?
No, they aren't. Well, kind of. IIRC they are based on lower level layers (e.g. werkzeug) but there is not an application container as in java. Now I am not familiar with any of these technologies so I might be talking nonsense, but I think that Zope is an application server in python, although I haven't heard of Zope being used in any context. The fact is that most modern backend web programming is lightweight code. In the past it wasn't like so. There was a shift in how we manage web backend in the past 5-10 years, and application servers became just not well suited for this kind of evolution. But then again, I might be wrong. Please someone with more expertise correct me.
Modern web development is insane. CSS and HTML and JavaScript means you need to be writing three languages at once.
Personally, I don’t find Python’s syntax (well, to be specific Numpy’s API) easy to use for mathematical expressions. And from the examples I have seem Javascript syntax isn’t a million miles from Python?
Well es6 and the es versions after, heavily changed the syntax and added a bunch of new built in functions. It's much cleaner now imo. JQuery is basically dead due to the amount of built in functions they added. There still is a heavy emphasis on libraries tho on the front end, mostly due to the industry loving frameworks, such as react. I think node doesn't really need many libraries to use, other than express.
Your car, your fridge, flatiron, everywhere.
Considering most ad blockers work based on URLs the advertisement content is served from, it shouldn't make much of a difference.
Thanks for the info! &gt; JQuery is basically dead This is the best thing I've heard all year.
Look, this is the file for the database I made:- &amp;#x200B; import sys from sqlalchemy import Column, ForeignKey, String,Integer from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative\_base from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship from sqlalchemy import create\_engine &amp;#x200B; Base = declarative\_base() &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; class Restaurant(Base): \_\_tablename\_\_ = 'restaurant' id = Column(Integer, primary\_key=True) name = Column(String(250), nullable=False) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; class MenuItem(Base): \_\_tablename\_\_ = 'menu\_item' &amp;#x200B; id = Column(Integer, primary\_key= True) name = Column(String(80), nullable=False) course = Column(String(250)) description = Column(String(250)) price = Column(String(8)) restaurant\_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('[restaurant.id](https://restaurant.id)')) restaurant = relationship(Restaurant) engine = create\_engine('sqlite:///restaurantmenu.db') Base.metadata.create\_all(engine) &amp;#x200B; And this is the file to make a webserver to display those restaurant items on the website:- &amp;#x200B; from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer import cgi, cgitb &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; class WebServerHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler): def do\_GET(self): try: if self.path.endswith("/hello"): self.send\_response(200) self.send\_header('Content-type','text/html') self.end\_headers() &amp;#x200B; message = "" message += "&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;" message += "&lt;h1&gt;Hello!&lt;/h1&gt;" message += '''&lt;form method='POST' enctype='multipart/form-data' action='/hello'&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What would you like me to say?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;input name="message" type="text"&gt;&lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"&gt;&lt;/form&gt;''' message += "&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;" self.wfile.write(bytes(message,"utf8")) print(message) return if self.path.endswith("/hola"): self.send\_response(200) self.send\_header('Content-type','text/html') self.end\_headers() &amp;#x200B; message = "" message += "&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;" message += "&lt;h1&gt;&amp;#161 Hola !&lt;/h1&gt;" message += '''&lt;form method='POST' enctype='multipart/form-data' action='/hello'&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What would you like me to say?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;input name="message" type="text"&gt;&lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"&gt;&lt;/form&gt;''' message += "&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;" self.wfile.write(bytes(message,"utf8")) print(message) return except IOError: self.send\_error(404,'File Not Found: %s' % self.path) &amp;#x200B; def do\_POST(self): try: self.send\_response(301) self.send\_header('Content-type','text/html') self.end\_headers() ctype, pdict = cgi.parse\_header(self.headers.getheader('content-type')) if ctype == 'multipart/form-data': fields = cgi.parse\_multipart(self.rfile, pdict) messagecontent = fields.get('message') output = "" output += "&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;" output += " &lt;h2&gt; Okay, how about this: &lt;/h2&gt;" output += "&lt;h1&gt; %s &lt;/h1&gt;" % messagecontent\[0\] output += '''&lt;form method= 'POST' enctype='multipart/form-data' action='/hello'&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What would you like me to say?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;input name="message" type="text"&gt;&lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"&gt;&lt;/form&gt;''' output += "&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;" self.wfile.write(bytes(message,"utf8")) print (output) except: pass &amp;#x200B; def main(): try: port = 8080 server = HTTPServer(('',port), WebServerHandler) print ("Web server running on port %s " % port) server.serve\_forever() &amp;#x200B; except KeyboardInterrupt: print (" \^C entered, stopping web server...") server.socket.close() &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; if \_\_name\_\_== '\_\_main\_\_': main() Now this course obviously uses BaseHTTPServer to design the website, which as you pointed out was not really used in real applications but it is also nit very easy to use. I was wondering what is the best and easiest way to use/transition from BaseHTTPServer to Django? Can you help? Look you have already helped a lot, so if my questions are a bit on the long side, please don't hesitate to tell me. I can easily look this up on the internet. The reason I asked you is because you seem to know a lot and you have been so helpful, and for that I am grateful.
Start with the [Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/intro/tutorial01/) - it actually builds something like this by the end of the tutorial itself.
Your airplane, too. Don't tell Samuel Jackson that the last time he flew, there was python onboard. Might bring back bad memories, which I'm sure he's sick and tired of.
Think of all the glorious dependencies we can have now.
Don't tell anyone on r/javascript this, though. All the "jQuery is still useful even though 90% of its functionality is built into the browser" people come out from their cupboards and start throwing rude words around.

I don't think any language that doesn't support operator overloading can properly overtake one that does for any sort of mathematical programming. If you're just doing simple work with floats and ints, then sure. Applied mathematics, however, requires a bit more than that
In earlier tests I was able to detect people walking around the room, so that's not a totally crazy idea. I think you'd need at least a couple more sensors to be better able to distinguish footsteps from other stuff, and/or to triangulate them.
In most countries it's not illegal to violate a tos. In the country I spend most of my time in, the tos isn't even legal in the first place. just do what you want, don't damage their site with excessive requests because that eoyld be bring a jerk, and the worst that'll happen is they ban your ip or account.
mint makes some changes from ubuntu and several things don't work properly use pip instead of apt to install anything python related
why would you install globally with apt?
Most , or almost all of the AI work is done in Python... So all of AI based cars have Python embedded in them like Tesla etc.
Umm. '37' - 7 30 &amp;#x200B; '37' + 7 "377" &amp;#x200B; Holy hell. I mean I know no decent programmer would ever do anything like this, but if it's not even internally consistent, it sure does make me not want to make anything I care about with it. I've been avoiding it (mostly) for 20y too, and I have heard people say "no, it's good now!" and I started working through an ES6 tutorial, and that example above was put near the front in the 'gotchas' category. All languages have gotchas; my favorite (Python) certainly does. But when you've made backwards incompatible changes to the language and don't fix stuff like the above, I get suspicious. Also, I don't want to learn npm. :-/
Keep in mind it is still used extensively in the actual industry because legacy code. But yeah its pretty much useless for a new project.
The thing I like about Python is its modules or libraries... You can find library for almost anything, which can save you lot of time..
More. Because you have to know SCSS, probably some frameworks, probably npm. And then the polyfills and shims. It's a compile target, which is sad, and the complexity and brittleness is very sad too.

Agreed. Off topic: I have a suspicion life would be a lot simpler for compiler writers if we used pre- or post-fix notation for written mathematics though.

At what point in web development did you not need HTML, CSS, and JS?
&gt; Javascript isn't that bad anymore mate &gt; [] == [] false
Django's popularity is based on many parameters, probably the major one is [its documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/). Btw, [r/djangolearning/](https://www.reddit.com/r/djangolearning/) and [/r/django/](https://www.reddit.com/r/djangolearning/)
I'm surprised Haskell isn't on your list of hipster languages.
equality check just doesn't work with arrays. It's not really that big of a deal. you just do JSON.stringify(a1) === JSON.stringify(a2);, or use lodash if you want to do it fast.
That might happen, but if it does, it'll be because of WebAssembly, not this project, which seems mostly focused on scientific computing.
~~Compile once~~, run everywhere?
NPM already has wasm Rust packages.
6 billion devices running Python. All of them are dildos and all can be eaten by Larry Ellison.
html and css aren't really languages... they're just for visual formatting.
I mean it is kinda consistent. JS was designed to never crash cuz browsers crashing is a no no, so there is a lot of stuff like that where if you give it shit, it'll return the best of what it thinks is true. It has logic in your case. if you add to a string it does string concatenation, because it thinks that would make more sense. If you subtract, it wouldn't make sense to do string concatenation, so it just does subtraction. I think JS is mostly backwards compatible? I don't think they've added anything major that broke things? It's def better than the whole python 2, python 3 thing. npm is fairly simple, it's similar to pip. It's better than pip imo for that matter.
I did the free class at codecademy. It landed me a job so I can say I'm pleased with the results.
I didn't want to go there, but, like web Bluetooth, this could be as fantastic as it is terrible.
&gt; equality check just doesn't work with arrays. Or primitives. Just in general, type coercion in JavaScript is a minefield. &gt; you just do JSON.stringify(a1) === JSON.stringify(a2) I've done exactly that -- *serialized* an object to compare its equity to another object. I've actually done that many times. It's just not something I've done in a language that I would describe as *good*. Every time there's a thread about JavaScript, the consensus is it's a bad language, but someone always chimes in with, *it's not so bad anymore.* PHP has the same habit. And yes, there are some very talented people working to make JavaSCript (and PHP) better, but you can never undo old mistakes and some of those mistakes are substantial, like comparison being generally broken in a language. Comparison is a pretty fundamental thing in programming. So, yes, JavaScript is serviceable-ish now with the right tooling. ES6 with Babel is a good start. But it's still just pretty unpleasant to work in.
I just don't think it's bad enough to warrant resources going to fully replacing it anytime soon.

I have been given a task to make a programme for end clients. The programme needs to take in XML files and delete/Anonymize certain columns and produce a new XML file with the columns deleted/Anonymized. I have been given around 12-16 weeks to learn how to and produce this programme. I am wondering if it's possible to make a presentable GUI and achieve this task using python as I am a complete beginner. &amp;#x200B; Thanks
I don't think Jupyter takes anything from the browser except the user interface
This is completely different. Jupyter has a real python working on a server, when you run a notebook python is executed server side. With pyodide, python is executed client side, in the browser. The server only gives you the js files, it doesn't run any computation.
Really? I think it should be a top priority. I've often mused, *shit, it's 2019, and I'm still somehow seeing JavaScript.* But the real value of moving on wouldn't be type comparisons. It would be all the features other languages have always had that will negate the weirdest parts of Vue/Angular/React. VueX and Redux in particular -- which are just plain weird to work with -- *could* be so much simpler with, say, properties in Python.

Just keep grinding.
Hey! It's Brendan from Kite. We're in an active beta for Linux right now and are planning to launch in 2 weeks, at PyCon! Will you be there?
Okay, would this make it possible to run Jupyter Notebooks wholly in the browser, no client-side software / install necessary?
Python is a terrible first language, honestly. I could see it being overwhelming because it skips over a lot of fundamental parts of computer science. It would probably benefit you a lot to take an intro to c++ or Java.
I am not an expert in them all but they all implement the WSGI standard.
I use high-dimensional radial polyharmonic thin-plate splines in some of my work. Building involves a matrix inversion and then using involves a matrix-vector product. It can get kind of slow so I am excited to see if this can speed it up for me! I will have to play around but it is also hard since it is likely even more machine dependent than CPU performance. I also need to better profile my own code to see if the bottleneck is the matrix-vector product or building the matrix.
I have little experience with web dev, but does it mean that jupyter notebooks could be implemented in the website and run there? Or could you enhence simple github html pages with it since you can not use server side tools?
I went from hating JavaScript at ES3 or so, to almost tolerating it at ES5, to liking it almost as much as Python at ES6. Many of the new features (like how classes are constructed) are directly influenced from Python. I really like how symbols work and wish Python had something equivalent. (you can kind of fake it if you squint.) I love how promises are a first-class entity and cooperative multitasking is the norm.
Seventh level of dependency hell, here we come!
Parcel actually let's you import rust as wasm modules to use in your JS.

I've been thinking about switching from Chrome to Mozilla for a while now but this just made my mind. Goodbye Chrome, you RAM-devouring piece of shit.
Python is the best of all worlds: powerful, easy to learn, easy to write, easy to read, with a huge load of open source libraries. Python is better than javascript, because javascript has a lot of problems that are deeply rooted in how the language works. See [javascript, the weird parts](https://charlieharvey.org.uk/page/javascript_the_weird_parts). The trouble with developing for the web is that there is always something running on some server, like loading a video, and then there is your browser that also does things, like animations. The stuff that's on the server can written with basically any language, but the stuff that's on your browser can **only** be javascript. That's because if you write a website it needs to be supported by all browsers and browsers only support javascript. It would be a huge undertaking to convince Microsoft **and** Google **and** Apple **and** Mozilla to support any new language. Mozilla is taking the first step here, which is also good.
But does adding extra wheels to the bike make it faster? or you just want to make it safer?
What do you mean? The browser is running on the client side so some kind of config would be necessary ?I don't know about this feature though
TypeScript is not JavaScript, it transpiles to JavaScript. (It's a superset)
This is beyond horrible

Fuck yeah
What course in codeacademy? I just registered and taking computer science course but I only have 5 days free trial left for PRO. I am not sure I can finish the CS course before the trial expired
Whenever people rag on JS they always bring out type inequality. But everybody already knows about that issue, and it just doesn't come up that often.
Indeed python is easy to read by design: the syntax is oriented to be legible by humans. Seeing the amount of JavaScript code deployed by Google and others, compressed, ilegible, looking for optimize the bandwidth, sure, but seemig also like looking for obfuscation... I guess those won't be very interested in migrate or develope new web code, but will keeping js while supported by the browser. (And the malware creators too).

Typescript is just Microsoft’s way for sticking their fingers into everything so they can put their name on it.
Semi-fictional life story with a tech dive into greenlet &amp; gevent as a payload.
To bytecode, but that's mostly as a caching layer. I don't know very many python projects that distribute *only* the bytecode.
Either you dropped the `/s` or you have no idea what you're talking about.
Unless it's baked into the browser, you now get the joy of downloading a runtime and all of it's dependencies onto your mobile phone. People who don't understand what Javascript and all of it's tooling are doing are doomed to re-implement it.
I mean idk how you measure horribleness but like that bug took me like 5 minutes to fix via stackoverflow.
Try with passing strings like `",".join(jkeys)` and `",".join(jvalues)` instead of lists.
Yes, along with the free Ask toolbar.
No silly everyone knows cars only use Go
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit: - [/r/django] [django-bootstrap-modal-forms = A Django plugin for creating AJAX driven CRUD forms in Bootstrap v4 or v3 modals](https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/beb5er/djangobootstrapmodalforms_a_django_plugin_for/) &amp;nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
anyway you could share that? I'm curious in what jobs are looking for
WebAssembly is a low level vm, closer to a typed assembly language than to something like the JVM. Language interoperability will be just as hard as it is now for native software. It will make it a lot easier to have Python on the browser, but it won't help you call e.g. a Ruby function which calls into a Perl library that depends on a Java library.
It's more like wearing a helmet and removing the randomly ticking time bombs from the bike.
They added proper lexically scoped variables, and lambda functions that captures the current value of "this" at the function definition point. They also added a bunch of useful utils. That's pretty much it, nothing sensational or game changing. People always overexaggerate when they say "javascript isn't bad anymore". It's more likely that they used it so much they got used to the shitty part and learned to work around common issues.
In 1993, CSS and JS didn't exist, so you only needed HTML. Of course, you couldn't do anything interactive with it.
&gt; I know no decent programmer would ever do anything like this Not on purpose. But a developer might add a variable containing string to a variable containing a number by mistake, and not catch it until it's in production because your code doesn't explode while testing it, and in some cases the result might even look correct.
Unfortunately, Python is way too dynamic to be compiled to efficient code. PyPy is probably the best possible thing we can have at the moment, barring any new research breakthrough. Also, WebAssembly has no support for JIT compilers. You need to send the browser pre-compiled code.
*laughs in COBOL* Languages can live way longer than people think. Python 2 took 10 years to start dying, but it'll still be there in 10-20 years, powering lots of legacy codebases.
I'll be curious to see how it puns out.
&gt; ... to liking it almost as much as Python at ES6. I agree, but I still hate the fact, that JS has no proper standard library. This is a large disadvantage.
I expect that's true. It's not important. I agree. But it certainly doesn't inspire confidence that "no, it's good now". I'm not trying to find nits to pick in order to prove an emotional decision; I realize that this 'feature' isn't important. I'm saying why it puts a bad taste in my mouth: it's hard to accept/imagine that they got the important things right when the basic things are wrong, even though they've had chances to fix stuff. I'm still going to learn it.
What's confusing about that? You are comparing two different objects.
&gt; equality check just doesn't work with arrays. It's not really that big of a deal. you just do JSON.stringify(a1) === JSON.stringify(a2);, or use lodash if you want to do it fast. This post made my day.
Its not as bad as it once was, but its still not nearly as good as Python.
I figured that's why they did this, but I still don't like it :-) The point about "never ever crash" is a good one. I'm not sure I agree about python3, but that's ok.
Ah yes, the "modern" web development of 1994.
Mozilla possibly incorporating it into the browser should be on the list.
``` i = 1 while i == 1: ``` and ``` loop = 1 while loop == 1: ``` Should be replaced with `While 1:`
&gt; It's sad that elm is hard to interop with existing libraries, but I am developing with reason now and it's a pleasure to use it. "The Elm Architecture" was implemented in ReasonML as well: https://github.com/OvermindDL1/bucklescript-tea
This is a great idea. I'll have a dig at the code when I wake as I'm knackered. I made some things similar: * https://faithinhumanityscore.com - COMPLETED * https://vaultofdreams.co.uk - WIP Yet again... Great idea. x
it'll restart your progress but i guess as long as you've got everything saved and can just paste the info in to each exercise you could probably push your progress lol
Nice, i love your voting system :) And thx, don't forget to share my project &lt;3
The only thing I'd do is to remove the commented code in the while loop.

But Node.js does have a standard library.
Does this mean we can get our extensions back? I really miss DownloadThemAll.
Yeah Thx :)
Looks great, reminds me of [https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey)
I've been working on an [LC-3 Virtual Machine](https://github.com/mhashim6/LC-3) for a school project.
It wasn't really imagined to do all of that, though.. It was supposed to be a language that anyone could use to put their content online in an easy way. It just got stretched out more and more until we are where we are at now. That said, you can absolutely still have a basic website. You just don't get the bells and whistles. I consider that pretty cool tbh.
Looks interesting. I may give it a try.
OTOH, the Python standard library is usually pretty great but when it's missing something small I usually end up implementing it myself because there just hasn't been as much of a push to make comprehensive utility libraries in Python. JS + lodash is a more complete library than Python stdlib in part because it's able to evolve much more rapidly since it's not linked to language versions.
It’s totally normal. Some days are frustrating and you have no idea what you’re doing, and some days the code just flies out of your fingers. Don’t beat yourself up. Accept that sometimes you’ll doubt yourself, and that’s normal, and it won’t last forever. Keep going.
Do you think you will do noticably better with Firefox? Judging by your statement I can only assume that you already know how much difference of RAM usage there is between those two. Would you mind sharing? Honestly, I don't think there is a reason to switch browser I am used to for like 40 bucks? Used to be something like that.. It is too early to praise Mozilla for bringing Python to modern browser. This will take years and unfortunately I am not even sure if we are talking in single digits..
Thank you. The problem is that I am on Mac OS and this does not seem to work.
For example if you're using multiple modules with multiple scripts across the whole system. For virtual environments of course pip is the right choice.
There in lies the problem, I saw JavaScript mentioned way too many times in this short article. That is not a good sign at all and smacks as a half hearted effort to embed Python. Don’t get me wrong I honestly hate JavaScript and would absolutely love to see Python as the primary in browser programming language. When the mentioned using JavaScript for rendering that got me nervous and the follow on mentions about JavaScript did not inspire. Obviously some of this stuff could eventually go away but excessive layering hits performance badly. So yeah lots of good to like here but not the first class implementation I would be hoping for.
It's not really related to extensions, to my understanding. &amp;#x200B; With this setup (and WebAssembly in general) you are getting a compiled binary delivered from a web server along with a webpage, instead of getting a webpage &amp; a javascript script. The compiled binary, while it can bring along with it cool stuff like Python's handy dandy scientific toolkit (or pretty much anything), and a compiled binary would be potentially a LOT faster than js, it's still going to be limited to only being able to "touch" the same things javascript could.
firefox already needlessly wastes a lot memory as it is, I can't even imagine how completely unusable it'd be with a haskell implementation baked in
That might be true, I stay so far away from Javascriot that I really don’t know and don’t care. The problem here is one of the intended uses for Python in the browser. I can’t see people that have spends years writing science code putting up with some of the stupidity in JavaScript.
Unfortunately py2 implicitly encodes/decodes. That's my main concern dealing with an old codebase.
So you're saying that `==` shouldn't test for equality like it does in other languages, but rather, whether two objects are *the same object*, not just that they have the same value? Even if you decide that's how it should work, which it objectively should not, then #2 should still fail. These are different objects: ``` &gt; [[[0]]] == 0 true ```
Does it work with Pandas?
I think they removed the restriction based on the news on May 2, 2018. So now we can skip and jump to individual lessons. I was able to click on the bottom material. Let's see how it goes.
Afaik this is cross platform. A lot of people seem to think this is firefox only
thank you for this.
Why would you use multiple modules with multiple scripts across the whole system? What if you need different versions? Why would you tie your ability to update to the OS's package manager?
- /r/learnpython - Format your code - Show the actual error - Show a minimal example of the failing code: this is not runnable
Honestly at this point all browsers hog RAM. I use Firefox myself but in all honesty it's really not much better when it comes to memory usage compared to Chrome.
System administration and such
Not Turing-complete programming languages per se, maybe, but definitely languages with their own rules and grammar.
As far as I can tell, the answer is "probably". Jupyter Notebooks give the user access to a Python kernel running on a server. Pyodide brings the kernel into the user's browser, but (I think) the user doesn't have direct access to it -- its purpose is to run Python code embedded in a webpage, like a browser's Javascript engine does for Javascript. In principle, I imagine it must be possible to write a Pyodide webapp whose function is to give the user Jupyter-like access to that kernel running in their browser. I have no idea how hard that webapp would be to write, or if there's any kind of performance or security issue in doing so, though.
&gt; JS was designed to never crash cuz browsers crashing is a no no Your browser doesn't crash from a JS error. Which is what should be raised for `'37' - 7`
Well it doesn't anymore. But that's what I heard why it was like that in the old days. They can't really change it now without hurting backwards compatibility.
Thanks, I love it.
That's already possible. Look up Jupyter servers.
Ok. So I know what factorial is, and I am doing an online class. In this class, one of the programs that I have to do to finish the module is this program, so I think I have enough coding knowledge. But my problem is: im my program, the user has to input the number he wants factorial, but after the first multiplication, I don't know how to make the next ones, without creating certain number of variables. And I know that if I create a certain number of variables, the user won't be able to choose the number he wants to multiplicate.
The problem is that I'm literally stuck hahaha. I just finished to answer the first comment, so my real problem is there. Tks
I'm trying to determine technological nearness of patents using only the text of the patent. Unfortunately, I'm having a whale of a time filtering out individual writing style as a confounding variable. I'm trying to figure out whether to continue with word and phrase frequency analysis (tf/idf) or do some relational mapping of words and phrases to hopefully filter out more of the patentese that isn't being caught by my global filter.
Ok. I'll see it now and then I reply you. Tks
Which means you have to perform the transpile step, which is extra steps. Personally my problems with the language don't end at typing.
Using Pillow (PIL for python 3), you can pretty easily add text to images. It's exemplified under the section in [this page](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter17/) titled "drawing text".
I'd prefer a language make major steps towards improvement than be scared to touch anything someone might have used 15 years ago.
It's not going to be replaced, it's been around too long. I think there needs to be options, like there is when programming for anything but web front-end.
well Ecma International (people who set the standards, taking in suggestions from Google, Mozilla, Microsoft, etc...) appears to disagree.
Thanks! I think that helped A LOT. I'll try to make it now. Thanks
And Rust
I mean they also added String.trim(), Array.isArray(), Array.forEach(), Array.map(), Array.filter(), Array.reduce(), Array.reduceRight(), Array.every(), Array.some(), Array.indexOf(), Array.lastIndexOf(), JSON.parse(), JSON.stringify(), Date.now() in ES5. Then they added classes, Default Parameters, Template Literals, Destructuring Assignment, and promises. They then added async/await and a bunch of ther stuff in es7 but I don't feel like writing everything after that. You can easily Google this stuff. JS has changed a lot.
keep in mind it does return false if you use \[\[0\]\] === 0. == is basically depreciated in JS world. It would be like hating on python because of python2.
Ohh... that seems like more trouble than it is worth.
What makes you think data interchange between these languages will be any different than it is with native code, including having to handle serialization, marshalling, and other FFI issues any differently than we already do? The only advantage that comes to mind is the potential for common representations due to the need to read and write them from javascript, but it'll still be burden just as it is now, and a common representation almost guarantees inefficiency so you know there will end up being n^2 optimizations to implement for n languages in the long run, all in the name of efficiency. There's no getting around the fact that each language has its own semantics, for types, and for memory ownership. In short, I don't see how wasm addresses interlanguage issues any differently than previous efforts, apart from its relationship to an existing js infrastructure.
Had not gotten back on here but thank you for your comprehensive response! I ended up specifying the dtypes within a dict that I passed in to the read\_csv and it worked fine. The whole tacking on the .0 is sensible, but it would still be nice if pandas could coerce it into an object for the sake of data processing automation.
Don't expect it. WebAssembly is not intended or designed to replace JavaScript. From their [FAQ](https://webassembly.org/docs/faq/): **Is WebAssembly trying to replace JavaScript?** No! WebAssembly is designed to be a complement to, not replacement of, JavaScript. While WebAssembly will, over time, allow many languages to be compiled to the Web, JavaScript has an incredible amount of momentum and will remain the single, privileged (as described above) dynamic language of the Web. Furthermore, it is expected that JavaScript and WebAssembly will be used together in a number of configurations: * Whole, compiled C++ apps that leverage JavaScript to glue things together. * HTML/CSS/JavaScript UI around a main WebAssembly-controlled center canvas, allowing developers to leverage the power of web frameworks to build accessible, web-native-feeling experiences. * Mostly HTML/CSS/JavaScript app with a few high-performance WebAssembly modules (e.g., graphing, simulation, image/sound/video processing, visualization, animation, compression, etc., examples which we can already see in asm.js today) allowing developers to reuse popular WebAssembly libraries just like JavaScript libraries today. * When WebAssembly gains the ability to access garbage-collected objects, those objects will be shared with JavaScript, and not live in a walled-off world of their own.
Is this a pro course?
Thank for the insight. I think my JSON data is being loaded differently than expected by the json.loads() code because the assert on jdata.keys and jdata.values fails. I’ll have to looks further into it. Still haven’t gotten the list as a string to work either yet. Some of my SQL database columns require types besides strings so it fails.
I have only 4gb ram in my laptop and I am not able to upgrade any time soon so any tweaking for performance helps honestly.
I think browsers are bloated enough, BUT if it's going to be bloat at least it's bloat I can understand and program in :D
I haven't worked with odbc, and googling brings me [https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/wiki/Cursor](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/wiki/Cursor). Is it possible that `executemany` is what you need instead of `execute`?
Alright so you're off to a good start! You've been able to identify a potential method of solving your problem, and you can also identify why it doesn't work! Now what you need to do is try to think of another way to do it. Is there any way that you could **loop** through all the numbers that you need?
this belongs in r/learnpython

I would feel better if more of the code in my car and air transportation was rusty

Seems like you did not read the article. It's about a project called pyiodide by Mozilla (the company, not the browser). This will work in Chrome or Firefox (by metric, faster in Firefox because the devs use Firefox to debug so it is optimised for that browser).
Also reminds me of https://github.com/szsdk/quick
Or even better, while True
Oh yes :) Thx dude

Now I gotta know what's cupy in Portuguese....
Thanks. &gt; there is not an application container as in java. What does "application container" mean? What do Django and Flask use instead of application container? &gt; application servers became just not well suited for this kind of evolution. Do Flask and Django use application servers? If no, what do they use instead?
Thanks for your help. I just finished the program using what you said. Tks for your time and your help!! :)

Question from a former "can't do Web frontend without jQuery" person: how have the new ES releases changed DOM manipulation? Is it as straightforward as jQ was to filter for a set (or subset) of elements and act on them (alter tree position, subelements, css, etc.) now?
Not strictly relevant, but C++ can be compiled into Wasm or JS, the compiler is called Cheerp. I believe there are Python interpreters written in C++, so in theory this can already be done.
I remember reading about the impending death of js years ago. I don't see it happening anytime soon.
Yes, it means that your Jupyter "server" (kernels) could also run in the browser :-)

Talk to the sponsor booth people and they usually have sponsored after parties you can get invited to.
I used python opencv, cv2's resize function. In the docs, it says it uses some interpolation algorithms such as nearest-neighbour or resampling with pixel area relation. Of course I didn't had to do any of that, my code is just a one liner and left it to the python-opencv library to work it's magic. As for colouring the excel cells, I converted the RGB values for each pixel(after resizing to grid size) into html format and then wrote that as the excel format. Also a one liner.
Months. :) Do you like it? I love feedback!
What do most people get into? Web?
PHP is far more popular for websites (mostly due to WordPress).
There is no answer to that question. It's like asking if most people get into using knives because they like to eat steak with them or because they like to put butter on toast. Python is a _tool_ and it's one you can use for many things. Instead of approaching the question as "What can Python on do that I'm interested in?" you may have more success approaching it as "I'm interested in X, Y and Z. How can Python help me with them?"
People actually follow the robots.txt? :p
jQuery deserves respect for what it did for web development. But it's also time for it to go.

I may be being pedantic but Python is quite strongly typed. I think you might mean static? In either case, obviously, Javascript is neither strongly typed or staticly typed.
Ramda is a pretty great library, too. Sanctuary is better, though.
I do, I am just now looking into classes and your game is a good way for me to see how you worked out classes for individual characters. do you store user input into db's? I saw there are some db files in your game.
And honestly, if you're running into issues from code like the `"0" == 0` example, then you should probably be questioning the quality of your code in general rather than blaming a JS wart.
Sometimes my imposter syndrome starts acting up then I read a comment like that one.
You write a bunch of general functions that do things on Skype. Then when you need to use those functions in your working script, you can import them in.
yeah, no shit.. &amp;#x200B; But how do you begin to write a function to do things to skype...?
Imo I don't see web development shifting en masse to Python. As there are a tonne of libraries for Python to do scientific computational stuff, JavaScript with its decades of monopoly has pretty advanced frameworks for front end stuff. However, with python being able to be compiled to web assembly using V8 and node using V8 to run, I think it will actually give a huge boost to node as then practically all Python libraries can be directly used by Node.
Unless I'm mistaken, Iodide is that webapp? This [Iodide notebook introduction to Pyodide](https://alpha.iodide.io/notebooks/300/) seems similar to Jupyter Notebooks to me, but I've barely used Notebooks...
Do web developers really think the world revolves around them or something. Specialized languages not made for the front end have existed for decades. &gt;If the flagship Python scientific stack has a front-end that isn’t in Python and can never be rewritten in Python, I take that as a sign something is wrong. Technically almost anything can be rewritten in any language given enough time and resources. But why bother? It would take ages to port all the scientific libraries and it would lose all the syntactical benefits of using Python. And it is not like being able to do data science in the browser is must-have feature. You mention Jupyter UI being written in JavaScript but it could have been written in any language. PyCharm supports Jupyter Notebooks and it is written in Java, and most other Python editors are written in languages other than JavaScript and Python. It would be like saying C# is useless because the IDE that runs happens to be written in C++.

Thank you
It sums up JS development well.
Pyinstaller can bundle the bytecode with the executable, that's how I distribute my project.
It doesn't seem like OP is interested in the general process of making a module of his/her own as much as throwing something together for Skype, so the title seems a bit misleading. &amp;#x200B; With that said, Skype4py has long since been abandoned by the look of things. given that the module takes advantage of a now completely unavailable desktop API, good luck getting it to do anything aside from providing a sad reference point. You'd have better look checking SkPy, which is a thin wrapper around Skype for web. Heavily lacking in features, buggy, and still in a prototype phase but at least you'll be able to get something rather than nothing.

Except that python2 is incompatible. Jk. Thats why "use strict" exists, but it could be something like "use strict es6". Still, first time using typescript/angular2 and im loving js even more now.
Yep, every time you run it, it checks for a db. If no db, then it remakes it using the included CSV files. Check dbsetup.py for how it does all that. No data is stored by users in the DB. The DBs are only accessed for object creation, like leveling up and fetching the new level's stats, or finding out the name of the enemies that are level 14, etc. Check the CSV folder for the kinds of things that can be customized. Also see how Game.Game() is called inside main.py. See how that when initialized, creates the DB for you if it can't find it :) This game isn't perfect, but it's a labor of love, I hope you can learn something.
Wow, thank you so much for the follow up. That made things a lot more clear. I’ll will check it out some more.
My wife crotchets and she has been asking me to make something like this for her! This get my creative juices flowing...thank you so much for posting this
Python inkscape api, or GIMP-Python should be able to do what your talking about.
It's a bug that should've taken you *zero* minutes to fix because any sane language wouldn't have it as a problem in the first place.
OP's wife here, indeed this is used for crocheting rather than knitting but OP can't tell the difference lol
Haha good to know, if I can recreate this software and allow her to import a picture that makes a pattern for her to follow...will definitely give me some good brownie points ;). Thanks for the follow up
`+` is the addition operator, `+=` the inplace operator. They are not interchangeables for a mutable left operand
Thank you, I'll be following closely. I'm really trying to figure out what I can begin working on with Python to both learn the program and potentially get to freelancing sooner or later.
Yeah ditto whatever she said. There were some issues shown in this video, the numbers were supposed to increment both horizontally and vertically for crocheting, but I've made the code changes and it does that now, in the git. Link in another comment.
We’re all colored by our own experiences. I’ve wanted to write custom widgets for Jupyter, and I was half tempted to try writing a plugin for VSCode to help with Python. Both would have involved learning Java/Typescript. Note I’m not a web developer. I’ve never touched web technologies. That’s half the reason I’m grumpy about this - I do know Python, I’ve even built simple GUI apps using both TkInter and PyQt. I wanted to port the visualisation part of that PyQt app to Jupyter and doing so *efficiently* would have required rewriting most of it in Javascript as far as I could tell. That was very disappointing.
Right now it runs off the terminal with arguments like \`python image\_to\_grid.py &lt;image\_path&gt; &lt;grid\_size&gt; &lt;dest\_excel\_path&gt;\` However, you can always make it user-friendly and have a GUI with Tkinter. You can start with tk.filedialog where it opens a form asking the user to select a file. [https://pythonspot.com/tk-file-dialogs/](https://pythonspot.com/tk-file-dialogs/) . Then you can have a field that asks for grid size. Followed by automatically opening up the finished excel file with \`os.system\` . Just an additional 5-10 lines in total. And if you want it to be an application that the user can just double click, you can extend it to become an exe with [http://www.py2exe.org](http://www.py2exe.org/)
Well, in theory, any Turing complete language can be compiled to any Turing complete language. The important point is doing it in a painless manner.
&gt; JavaScript with its decades of monopoly has pretty advanced frameworks for front end stuff. There isn't a monopoly, cause the JS programmers like to change their prefered frameworks twice every month.
Agreed, though i think it would be fairly easy to pre-compile and distribute a cached version of an interpreter with your webthing.
Thanks! I'll look into that!
Sounds good ill check it out when i get some free time. If i get around to making a GUI ill let you know
That's why most developers learn more than one language. Python is not the most common tool used to make GUIs so I encourage you to learn other languages as well if you like designing GUIs. I understand your frustration but the truth is, historically dynamic languages have not been a popular choice for writing consumer applications and the only (unfortunately) reason that I can think of that JavaScript is used to build GUIs nowadays is because of Electron, which is criticized for its high consumption of computational resources. Anyway, sorry for the unnecessary aggression in my original comment. Have a good day.
As a web tech illiterate I wonder why dont just add python interpreter to the browser like they did with the javascript engine. Instead of running the python interpreter in the javascript engine.
Do you have any ideas on how to start the problem? Please elaborate on how far you’ve gotten. What is your experience with OOP. We need more from you in order to assist. Right now, it seems like you just want the solution.

No problem! I should be posting part 2 tomorrow where you can learn how to use selenium to automate purchasing of goods. Selenium is such a useful tool, so if you get more into it the number of things you can use python for will be uncountable!
Looks like that code was written for python2. Strings and byte arrays ("bytestrings") work differently between the two, and this is one of the most common sources of incompatibility. So try python 2 first, and if that works, ask your tutor to help you with porting the code to python 3.
/r/learnpython
I'll try that next, funny thing is, my tutor just got back to me and said he was also using 3.7.3 (Which I was also using on the linux VM), where it worked.
Sorry, I don't know who that is.

The horribleness comes from the fact that you escalate a simple issue like comparing array elemtns into a full blown JSON encoding and string comparison. Simple issues need to have simple solutions. Not to mention the wasted CPU cycles.
Are you a programmer or coder yourself?
Yes, I guess?
Sometimes my imposter syndrome acts up a bit, but then I read a comment like that and I feel much better.
&gt; They are not interchangeables for a mutable left operand They *may not be* interchangeable. If `__iadd__` is not overloaded it just falls back on a regular addition and assignment. The other big `+=` trap I know of is on list (where `+=` is `extend`, not list concatenation, so it's going to mutate the LHS).
Of course, but the reason why people are interested in JS it is not because it's a great language, but because it has the momentum. Having alternatives will make JS compete based on its own merits and based on that I think it would fade, but that will take years (assuming this will be successful). Even though I hate JS, I'm not big fan of this either, it's basically ActiveX v2, they probably will make sure it is cross platform though and more secure, but machine will still be executing binary code that we have even less insight into.
One small thing: currently starting with line 28 of Game.py you have self.riddlemode = int(input()) if self.riddlemode == '': self.riddlemode = 0 but if someone hits enter, it'll try to parse the empty string as an int, which causes an error. I might try changing it to if self.riddlemode == '': self.riddlemode = 0 else: self.riddlemode = int(input())
This is because numpy operations with `+=` will operate in place. This is actually useful to avoid creating unnecessary copies. If you do array = array + 5 The right side evaluates first and creates a NEW object in memory of the size of `array`. Then the original `array` is changed to point to this new object. It doesn't matter much if your array is small (less than 1MB), but for something like a 1 GB array, this could make a big difference.
I'm mostly interested in modelling the real world and solving math problems.

Agreed, I really like the web version.
WTF are pointers in Python?
Hahaha interesting
You're not sure?
I'm not sure what the word means to you. To me, anyone who writes code is a "coder". I am professionally employed as a software developer, and my job is mostly Python - I guess that's the answer to what you're actually asking.
You're self taught, is that it? Is that what the hesitation is about?
I have a degree in what basically amounts to OS development, so no, that's not it.
There's a way to disable it, unfortunately that breaks stdlib which relies heavily on it.
Variables are python are automatically pointers. [https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-pointer-in-Python-Does-a-pointer-exist-in-Python](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-pointer-in-Python-Does-a-pointer-exist-in-Python) So a = \[1,2\] b = a b\[0\] = 5 print(a) \&gt;&gt; \[5,2\] a is b \&gt;&gt; True
Well, you seemed very well-informed, that's why I asked. Most people need a lot of input especially over the internet before they can help. This actually means a lot more than just showing them the code.
It took 10 years, because Python project was very generous with timing. Everyone waits for the last possible moment to do the porting. Libraries waited until 2015 when 2.7 got frozen, many places started porting in 2019 when Python started reminding everyone that it will be EOL in 2020. If they would give maybe 2 years, everyone would migrate quickly, there wouldn't be much FUD and people wouldn't start new application in Python 2 during last 10 years.
Whoops. Thank you!

Shit, that mandatory riddle thing is broken ATM. I need to push a real change / series of fixes and updates to github soon, sorry.
If you want it as a tat it would probably look better in gray.
I was puzzled about erlang (never used elixir or ReasonML, so can't comment on those), yes it is strongly typed, but I got impression that Python (especially 3) is much stricter. Looking at the given list I have feeling the author wanted a functional language instead.
It’s okay, spirited discussions are what Reddit is for! I do know several languages already (C++, Python, Matlab, etc.). Electron/Javascript have come about because the web is already the most widely deployed platform. For whatever reason, Jupyter (IPython at the time) decided they had to target the web as well, and that by definition meant Javascript. I really wonder where we would be if they had continued working on the QtConsole instead - that’s my preferred way of interacting with Python these days.
Holy shit and walking around with a shirt with “pseudocode” on the back. Next level cringey
Source Code: https://github.com/vivek3141/tictactoe-minimax
Imagine him carrying a cigar in one hand and old. 35 magnum pistol in other hand. He wears a cowboy hat and look at you with an annoyed face. I guess that would be memorable moment.. :V
it’s the python equivalent of ‘btw I use arch’.
I would laugh in his face for his dumb shirt and proudly take a bullet
Variables in Python are not pointers, they are references to objects.
His shoes even match, this guy is on another level
"properties" should be a list/array in that JSON if you ask me
It looks like a shirt marketing for Barracuda the security company. https://www.barracuda.com Otherwise the guy really digs barracudas.
That's just JSON, not code, and looks like a company or conference shirt. You ever been around techies before? Wearing conference or company t-shirts is the dress code
1. /r/learnpython 2. Look into the `datetime` module if you just need local time; add `pytz` if you need timezone conversions.
we call them _references_
Idk who you are to think that this Json is "pseudocode". Especially since you learn about dictionaries really early as a Python beginner :) But hey if calling everything you don't know about cringy grants you some upvotes. Whatever floats your boat.
Probably a swag shirt, who cares
yes i ve actually looked at the pytz but whenever i change the systems clock the output changes aswell
Yes, that's how it works. Do you need to get accurate time for a specific timezone that's independent from your system clock? Why?
yes i need to get accurate time for a specific timezone thats independent because my computer changes the clock randomly and that is annoying
It looks too far left on his arm. It needs to be indented another two spaces
What do you mean by "my computer changes the clock randomly"? This sounds like you're trying to solve the wrong thing. When does your computer's clock change/
You are welcome!
They turn out to be implemented in terms of pointers but that isnt usually something you should care about since python doesnt expose things like manipulating the pointer itself through pointer arithmetic. The easiest way to reason about it tends to be that assignment binds a *name* to an object, and so `a = b` causee `a` and `b` to be two names for the same list.
Does it also obey the crawl-delay directives from robots.txt? Also, you might be interested in [https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.robotparser.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.robotparser.html) for parsing the robots.txt file, rather than doing it manually with regex. Also, I see a lot of duplicate code in [spider.py](https://spider.py) If you are interested in web scraping, you can take a look at scrapy which provides a lot of extra features out of the box.
I know this belongs in r/learnpython, but the error is because you didn't `str()` the input; try doing that.

It looks like it’s either a fake tattoo coming off or a real tattoo that’s about 5-8 days old. They look *awful* during that phase where they’re all scabby and peeling, plus the color gets lost under the scabs and new skin. It probably looked fine a couple weeks after this was taken.
If you regret a tattoo when you're around 60, that is pretty ok anyway. Not like he will look at the back of his upper arm that much anyway.
This is the best by far
lol no generics
I'd say you're right. The UI is a little less polished, but that looks like the same basic functionality as a Jupyter Notebook. I guess that answers the question!
You know Sentdex?
AHA! Read your post more carefully, and actually looked at the error. So let's see. First of all, the errors you get hint at a problem with UTF8 decoding. This generally happens when you pass a byte array ("bytestring", the `bytes` type in Python 3) to something that expects a string ("unicode string", the `str` type in Python 3, or `unicode` in Python 2). You probably noticed that the errors, despite being different, always occur on line 20 of your script, which is the line that says `open(filename[1:])`. At this point, there is only one thing possibly involving unicode / UTF8, and that's the `filename[1:]` argument. Another hint is that the errors occur on Windows, but not on Linux. So let's put this together: you use `socket.recv()` to get the HTTP request, which returns a `bytes` object (so NOT A STRING!). You split that into chunks, take the second chunk, remove the first byte (NOT CHARACTER!) from it, and use that as the filename. On Linux, this "works" just fine, because to Linux, a filename is just a byte array, and it doesn't care whether it's valid unicode or not, so the Linux implementation of Python's `open()` function will happily accept any byte array you throw at it. But on Windows, filenames are Unicode strings (internally encoded in UTF-16 IIRC, but that's an irrelevant detail), so `open()` will try to convert byte arrays into strings, using the currently set encoding. And apparently, the bytestring you pulled out of the HTTP request is not actually valid UTF-8. Why exactly that is I can't tell, but it seems likely that either you're sending invalid UTF-8 in the first place, or your "parsing" (split and remove first byte) is wrong (e.g., if you take a UTF-8 string that begins with a multi-byte code point, and snatch off the first byte, then you're left with a byte array that starts with a byte that can never be the first one in a UTF-8 encoded string). An easy way to find out is to just print the filename to the console before trying to open the file; this should give you a hint as to what exactly is going on.
It also looks like it could've been raked in with a mag 15 needle all the way around by someone who doesn't know now to tattoo and its actually only a year or two old. As a candid picture taken by a creepy guy walking behind a stranger, I reckon we'll never know.
Oh noes someone who is different from you, they must suck....

Tattoos are for weak minded people.
1. /r/learnpython 2. It's the Python 2 notation for "long" numbers, i.e. integers that can be bigger than machine sized.
In java, in the old days, you used a perpetually running application container such as tomcat. It provides a host of services you can use and you add your application by deploying it in the framework. The app container then takes care of the dispatching. this is AFAIHeard, because I never used one. django and flask don't use an app container at all. they are a framework to write web applications, but they don't have to reside within a app container. Your web server dispatches the call to them via a python protocol called WSGI, and this dispatch is then massaged through a series of layers until it reaches your handlers. Python monkeyed tomcat with Zope. In Zope you deployed python programs using the Zope framework and once deployed they were available to respond to your calls. The problem with this approach is that the app frameworks are very monolithic, and today the preference is to use a docker instance, spawn it up, have the instance reply, and kill it. It's cheaper and more flexible than having a big, monolithic appserver running all the time and dispatching to installed applications. Still, I am not an expert, I just heard things and kind of understood things my own way. I could be dead wrong.
Make a new list and if x is not in that list, then append it there. Otherwise just pass and then return the new list.
You will need to use some composing : the customer can have a list as attribute that hold the different accounts. Also, check learnpython

I mean I had a similar bug with python because I didn't realize "==" and "is" are different, which again took me 5 minutes to fix.
create a set from the original list - [Unordered collections of unique elements](https://docs.python.org/2/library/sets.html)
Lst=set(no_list)
It's a very interesting concept, but it opens a can of worms in terms of package installation. Imagine you install e.g. numpy for that executable. It will either need to compile C code to webassembly (which is a possibility) or need a compiled wheel for the "browser" platform. It's feasible sure, but damn...

Working on a university assignment where I have to make a space quiz. Other than getting the questions to randomly generate, am failing miserably and close to just giving up. Doesn't help that this is meant to be a group assignment, so am basically doing a 3man job I also need to make a menu, somehow get the user to login through a file I've created to store their usernames, and so much more I just can't figure out. But if I don't pass this I'll fail the year so I HAVE to finish it. Somehow. (please help Im a python noob and this is actually depressing me)
All I said is Typescript is not Javascript. Which is literally true. I'm not sure why people are confused.
Its not just a difference in terminology, references behave differently from pointers.
&gt; They turn out to be implemented in terms of pointers And pointers are implemented as operations on integers, and integers are implemented as sequences of bits. Therefore everything in Python is just flipping bits. *wink*
Decided to learn Git and clean and reorganize files into repos aswell as doing some rewrite-work for a couple of scripts. I'm also trying to learn PyQt5.
Thanks. I was wondering what you mean by &gt; Python monkeyed tomcat with Zope
The best way I know how to handle it is to use unicode_literals from future. And trying to explicitly convert if possible. Then there's also the py 2 str() is a byte_string unicode() is a unicode_string py 3 str() is a unicode_string bytes() is a byte_string
You should have `no_list = []`
No, its just people who are familiar with C assuming that languages which are nothing like C are just like C. Since the only thing in C which is kinda vaguely similar to object references is the pointer, they assume that object references are pointers. When the only tool you understand is a hammer, then screwdrivers become "pointy hammers", glue becomes "liquid nails", and spanners become "like a hammer, but you twist it instead of swinging it".
Hoping for a GNU/Linux distro using this as package manager…
&gt; The other big += trap I know of is on list (where += is extend, not list concatenation, so it's going to mutate the LHS That's not a trap, that's the whole point of `+=`. "Watch out for the trap of `list.append`, it doesn't create a new list, it appends the item to the end of the existing list..." *wink*
OP, where was this taken? I had a professor at Pitt with the same tattoo!
Fuck that's cringe
Wow boss you use "we" pretty wildly there
Calling things cringey in 2019
You're right. This instance of we excluded me.
&gt; That's not a trap, that's the whole point of +=. It absolutely is a trap, and is not "the whole point" of +=: list.extend already exists and is strictly more flexible than `+=`. The only thing `list.__iadd__` does is make code more brittle and mutations less visible.
&gt; Variables in python are automatically pointers Not even close. If you said that variable references in Python behave *in some ways* quite similarly to the way pointers behave in C, then you would be close. In pure Python: * there is no pointer type; * there is no way to ask for a pointer to an object, or a variable; * no way to ask what variable, or object, exists at a certain memory address; * no way to dereference a memory address and find out what is at that location, or write to it; * you can't assume that an object will always have the same memory location (in some implementations, like Jython and IronPython, objects can and will move around in memory); * You can't do pointer arithmetic. Even if pointers are used in the implementation of the Python virtual machine, there are no byte-code instructions or Python language features for manipulating pointers. Pointers don't exist in the Python language, except in the weak sense that we can say any value which indirectly refers to another value is "a pointer": items = [bunch, of, stuff] current_index = 0 # "points" to the first item the_value = items[current_index] Another way to think of it: Python expressions operate behind the scenes as references to objects; pointers are a kind of reference, but not all references are pointers. (Analogy: cars are a kind of vehicle, but that doesn't mean that motorbikes, trucks, aircraft and horse-and-buggies are cars.)
That's the worst idea I've ever heard. It would cost a lot less to use macros to replace the Python code with the equivalent C++ code at compile time.

[Old versions](https://www.python.org/doc/versions/) of the documentation are available, back to [version 1.4](http://docs.python.org/release/1.4/). There's little or no documentation for Python before version 1.4 because 1. it was a tiny open source project written and used by a handful of programmers, who traditionally aren't very good at writing documentation ("read the source" is sometimes considered documentation). 2. The 0.x versions were not considered stable. 3. The source code and whatever documentation was written for 0.x was lost. If you look very hard, you may be able to find a reconstructed version of 0.9, but its so old that you may not be able to compile it.

They cannot be indexed by Google so that the text can be searched for, and they make it impossible for us to copy and paste the code to run it for ourselves.
A true leader of the people then I see.
I consider a Python reference to be a pointer to a Python object. One can't do pointer arithmetic on them or have pointers to a raw pointer, but I'm not certain either of those are required for a "pointer". I agree that it's very unhelpful to call them _pointers_ as that causes confusion.

TL;DR: There's a dunder method `__call__` which implements the behaviour when an object is called: `Obj()`.
Don't feel bad about not understanding matplotlib. It is a huge and complicated library (and not a very well designed one). I've been using it for over ten years, and I still feel like it's some capricious god that I have to woo with magic incantations, which sometimes work and sometimes don't. It will get better in time. 10 months is but a blink, barely enough to even begin getting proficient. It is normal to feel lost. For what you have learned to become intuitive, it needs time and practice, practice, practice. In some ways, the feeling will never pass. I've been working in software for 20 years, and the amount of stuff that I know about computing is dwarfed by the amount of stuff there is still to learn. After a while you just come to terms with this, you will understand that the sum of knowledge is greater than any single human can learn, and that is perfectly okay. Nobody knows everything, we all know a little bit, and it is through working together that we can build anything, from alarm clocks to space stations. Intending to go through a formal university education is a very good idea. It will give you a more systematic, more gradual introduction to many topics, and also - very importantly - it will give you peers with whom to learn and grow together. Learning all this stuff on your own is hard, really hard. And you basically jumped into the deep end of the pool when you went into data science. It is a huge and complicated topic, in many ways harder than typical programming. Just keep calm and carry on. You have made an impressive start already.

Thank you so much for your encouragement. This exactly what I needed to hear. I wish you all the best and I hope one day to be as experienced as you are
I did this problem years ago. So it’s fairly easy with scipy for a limited accurate food list. Your problems come in when you want to use the USDA food database. There are 3 versions, Excel, which is very incomplete as well as the Microsoft Access and some binary format. I chose the binary format over Access and parsed it pretty quickly (I think it took me a few hours). Now to the problems with the database. Fish oil doesn’t contain omega 3s. Many foods are missing something and others are just wrong (e.g., venison is much less nutrient dense than beef/chicken, which I seriously doubt). The database is 5000+ entries, so 5000+ variables. Also a point on optimization, constraints always make the problem harder if they are active. You also have to add the can I physically eat this much food. You also should consider food allergies/intolerances/preferences. I can’t eat bread, so that dramatically reduces the number of variables. That is handled as a constraint, so it can make the problem easier. Also, liver and spices is the answer.
This certainly looks like a newer tattoo that's in the peeling process, I agree.

I’ve been working as a developer and mainly with Python for some years now, in different kinds of projects but mostly in Big Data. Python has always been one of my favorite languages and programming was a hobby for me before starting my career as a developer. Although I can notice I don’t work on personal projects as much as I did years ago, I can say I enjoy what I do. Obviously there are weeks or tasks that are annoying or plain boring, but also help you learn a lot. And even when I have to switch to a different language that I don’t personally like that much, it helps me learn different approaches to different problems so every time I come back to python I do so with a huge motivation (and a grown appreciation for this language). If you really enjoy programming and the language I certainly encourage you to try and begin a career on this if you can. You’ll never stop learning and enjoying it.

Most people that get a tattoo don't do it thinking exactly what they get will be relevant in the same way in 30 years.
I usually use a recursive function to sort my list, so I'm a bit out of the loop...
Yeah, sorry I didn’t think about that for the errors.

Hard. Mostly because of three things: 1. people who claim they can code in python, but they are not programmers, rather they are scripters and don't understand that between writing a python script and writing a python program there's an abyss. 2. The massive amount of legacy that the py2/3 switch is going to bring. If you did your homeworks when it was the time, it's ok, but you won't believe how many realities don't bother and how hard they are going to be hit when they must switch to py3 for one reason or another. 3. People don't understand how to manage and package python applications. It's hard if you are in the field. it's even harder if you are not. Throw some C+ in the mix and it's a nightmare. I've seen them all. If a company manages dependencies using export PYTHONPATH, run.
I use python to automate a lot of my analytics workflow (almost eliminating excel increased my productivity dramatically) and spend the freed up time learning more python. Feeding SQL queries into DataFrames (pandas is life) has also dramatically improved my productivity, since some tasks that are exceedingly simple in python require black magic in Oracle SQL.
If Typescript were equal to Javascript, it would run in a browser. You'd think programmers would be pedant, but they're not here?
Almost: mypyc will compile type-annotated Python code to an optimized C. Source: https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2018-August/154951.html
&gt;how many people reinvent the wheel, when there is a package out there that does what they need already. Often written by a really crappy programmer. You have to balance the difficulty in rolling your own solution and supporting it with the hassle and risk of making someone else's code one of your dependencies.
This seems to be a bit much...
We finished the migration! We put up our main takeaways here: [https://enterprise.foursquare.com/intersections/article/how-our-intern-led-pants-migration-to-python-3/](https://enterprise.foursquare.com/intersections/article/how-our-intern-led-pants-migration-to-python-3/).

1. /r/learnpython 2. I assume you're running it as a script and not in a REPL - in that case you need to explicitly `print` the return value of your functions.

I primarily use python to process data. Sometimes pull data from one source, manipulate it, and load it into another database. We mostly focus on GIS spatial data, so I do a lot of preprocessing work to mashup spatial data from multiple sources. For example. We have 500k point features and we want to know what county, state, region, various other administrative boundarys. We could on the fly write a query to grab all that data, however those queries may take hours to run. Not really user friendly. So, I mash all that up and store the results in a table so we can write a simple query to join the point feature table to this mashed up table and we get immediate results. I also write tools to automate previously manual steps. We have a SharePoint library of all the workorders processed by our data entry people. We used to have a person create a pdf and then upload the PDF. Then fill out app the metadata about the workorders. My process creates the PDF, uploads the PDF, and populates the metadata. This frees up time for our staff to work on more important tasks.
As an experienced Oracle developer and Python beginner I’m genuinely curious. What are some examples that are easy in Pandas and hard in Oracle?
Sorry wasn't all the way awake when I wrote the post. Meant to post something like this. Me: "Rewrite the code by hand?! Are you insane?! It would cost X dollars to rewrite the code by hand. It would only cost Y dollars to use my automatic tool." Manager: "I'm sorry we decided not to use your automatic tool like you wanted, instead we will continue to use Python because your automatic tool will cost too much money."
Hi, Thanks all for your inputs. I'm new to Python and especially brand new to OOPs concepts and never ever learnt or had any experience like I mentioned in my post. I just started learning OOPs in Python and wanted to try a real world example which we daily see in our life. Regarding what I tried so far is something like I created a class for the bank customer but not sure how do I proceed further to have the customer with multiple accounts. For Ex: class customer: def \_\_init\_\_(self,name,account\_number, city): self.name=name self.account\_number=account\_number self.city=city &amp;#x200B; cust1=customer("ABCD",1234,'MyCity') #Savings Account cust1=customer("ABCD",5678,'MyCity') #Checking Account cust1=customer("ABCD",9999,'MyCity') #Credit Card Account I know this is not correct but couldn't find any help online exactly to what I wanted. I would really appreciate if someone, can help me out with the actual solution for this problem. Thanks a lot in advance again!
We’re just starting to use Python in our small team, to write simple “query database and display results (PyQt)” type applications. So far we’ve been packaging with cx_Freeze. Is this ok, or is there a better way?
Please, try this example, before we move on. It might look simple, but it definitely isnt. //units for nutrients = DV % - daily intake value % Name of the food { protein, carbs, fats, calorie }; Apple { 1, 10, 3, 10 } Avocado { 3, 2, 15, 7} Tomato { 5, 2, 3, 2 } &amp;#x200B; Goal: Reach 100,100,100 with minimal cost
Thanks! Will check them out.
Hello, thanks for your input, but I dont have problems with my dataset. I dont consider multivitamins, fish oils and other refined stuff. &gt; constraints always make the problem harder if they are active Well, sorry but thats really far from true. When I cut down the search space, how is that making problem harder ? It might be harder to compute, but the number of neccesary computation is reduced (by orders of magnitude), so the time to execute the program is reduced. &gt; Also, liver and spices is the answer. Fortified foods as well, but at that point,what about multivitamins? It’s the same thing. My dataset is for veggies, fruits, nuts and so on. Only healthy natural stuff.
it does look at crawl-delay. Yes it has duplicate code because it has to do things differently depending on what the robots.txt gives it. I have tried scrapy, couldn't get it to work. Also I just wanted a challenge. Messing with regex and making it read robots.txt properly
You may associate pdf extension with your custom script and in it make a call and setup your pdf reader.
"use strict" is a really bad idea. It creates two versions of a language, incompatible with each other, but intermingled throughout a project that imports other projects.
Biggest challenge for me was learning to code with corporate authentication methods... LDAP... Kerberos etc... Also not being allowed to install modules on any of the servers... ie: no requests module... Hmmm ... Oh python 2.6 is still primarily used on many of the servers lol.... &amp;#x200B; Nothing like looking at an obscure Stack Overflow post from 2009 for a weird 2.6 issue... often related to Flask
Weak minded to have some ‘doodle’ permanently inked on their skin. Very very weak minded individuals indeed.
&gt; And honestly, if you're running into issues from code like the &gt; "0" == 0 example that always gets passed around, then you should probably be questioning the quality of your code in general rather than blaming a JS wart. Not really. Especially when silent type coercion happens all the time. Suppose for example I have a component where users edit lists. When the component updates the data, I want to see if it's mutated. oldData === newData Except, or wait, `[] === []` returns *false*. That's not bad code, it's a bad language.
Hi /u/schedutron, that's amazing. I didn't even know I needed one of these in my life until I read your description! I've had a look at the source code and it's really easy to follow. One thing though, it looks like you have plans for an "admin" action, but it currently doesn't do anything (the function body of admin_action just contains a "pass" keyword). Out of sheer curiosity, what kinds of things had/have you planned for this admin function?

&gt;but they are not programmers, rather they are scripters and don't understand that between writing a python script and writing a python program i'm coming into Python as a seasoned Java programmer. i am finding it incredibly frustrating because of your statement, as well as the fact that a lot of folks have been exposed to Python through the scientific community (my current job is at a scientific company). i don't mean that in a negative way - they're very smart and write complicated stuff. but that's kinda my point: a lot of things don't seem to follow best practices from other software companies i've worked at. admittedly this is the Java in me coming out, but one example that comes to mind is documentation. i have been blessed by Javadocs and IDE's integration with them. need to know what that 3rd argument to that function is? hotkey will not only show you but pop open the Javadoc explaining it. while i see this in some Python libs, it's sparse to say the least. i find myself having to dig and dig just to see what i need to pass to something and to see whether or not it can safely handle what i want to pass it.
Honestly didn't know I could skip the step by having the request formatted for me. Happy to learn something new!
Docker, VCS, setuptools, and common-sense gets you 95% of the way there. One rule of thumb... if your build process (including the code in your `Dockerfile`) requires you to alter `PYTHONPATH` for your project to work, you're already doing something wrong.
Changed my profession in may 2018 (celebrating 1 year soon!). Before programming I was a marketing officer, but the lack of new technologies and “I already know everything in marketing” was really boring. I’m 34, so it was not easy choice. Now I suffer everyday. The more I learn, the more I understand how much I don’t know. But I’m happy. It’s really bottomless career path. One day from my profession: create new method for Facebook Ads API and fix wrong representation of data from Google Analytics API in our Marketing Analysis web-service.
Granted, I didn't try to do a deep dive into this; however, this appears to be a simple linear programming problem. You want to optimize for a certain variable (i.e. minimize cost) given a set of constraints. There are several linear programming solutions out there: scipy, PuLP, and others. They should make something like this pretty simple. If you're wanting to solve this problem from scratch ... well, that starts to make things get rather difficult and require brushing up on your mathematics.
Thanks! I have modified. Thanks again

https://kivy.org/doc/stable/guide/packaging-android.html There's a couple options on how to deploy your application. The easiest and quickest one is to use [Kivy Launcher](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/guide/packaging-android.html#packaging-your-application-for-the-kivy-launcher). Creating your own APK is a little more involved, but if your goal is to have a more "professional" application then that'll be the direction you'll want to go.

Instead of `complement(dnaInput)` use `print(complement(dnaInput))` You need to explicitly call the `print()` function to print something on the STDOUT.

I wrote a small article on logging using python and meta classes. https://medium.com/@sandeephukku/singleton-classes-and-meta-classes-for-logging-in-python-a81badb0df47 Here is the link. Update me where you think i can improve.
I've been working on using [PySimpleGUIWeb](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/tree/master/PySimpleGUIWeb) on Android. You'll find some instructions towards the bottom of this page: [https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/issues/1288](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/issues/1288) Here are the instructions I came up with. It's highly experimental and only runs in the browser, but it is running on your phone or tablet. You can also SHARE the fun by allowing your friends to connect to your phone/tablet too. They'll see the same GUI. I'm working on a 2-player game now to demonstrate it. You can write and run your apps on your PC and then move them over using FTP. You don't need to root your tablet/phone. Just use termux. ## Initial setup 1. Install termux from google play store Run Termux and from within termux do this: 2. pkg install python 3. pip install pysimpleguiweb 4. Create a folder to store your python code into - mkdir /sdcard/py Find your Android device's IP address by typing: ifconfig from within Termux. Look for wlan0 and then look for "inet addr:". This is your device's IP address that you'll need for accessing via windows ## At this point, you're setup for loading and running programs 1. Setup ftp server within termux pytcpsvd -vE 0.0.0.0 1111 ftpd -w /sdcard/py &amp; The &amp; is added at the end so that it'll run in the background. Move code over from windows to your Android device on windows: ftp open 192.168.0.123 1111 send c:/full/path/to/mycode.py At this point you've sent your code to your Android device and now you're ready to run it! Again inside termux: cd /sdcard/py python mycode.py Now your code is running!! You only need to "connect" a browser to it so see it run. On your tablet you can open it locally by launching Chrome and navigating to: 127.0.0.1:8080 OR, you can also connect to your program REMOTELY by pointing a browser to your tablet: 192.168.0.123:8080
You can do whatever you want with python!
This is more of a function of the employer/team than just the job itself, in my experience. &amp;#x200B; Either way: the day usually starts with a quick **recap** of what I've been doing previously and where I left off. If you're doing standups, you'll need that to give a status report to your teammates, but it's been a boon even when I was working solo. My current team does do them, so I take care of that, finish up any leftovers, and if there's nothing on my plate, mess around writing utilities to make my own life easier until the standup. &amp;#x200B; Unsurprisingly, 60-80% of the day is **programming** \- besides just writing code, this includes thinking about software design, which is arguably far more important. No amount of clever language tricks can save a program that is not put together sanely, and each extra line of code is a necessary evil, not something to be proud of. &amp;#x200B; Of that, how much of the tasks wind up being actual development, and how much is debugging/maintenance/assorted **chores** varies on the codebase, the company, and divine providence. IMO the best argument for following good practices is that it lets you do more of the former, less of the latter. &amp;#x200B; Additional 10-30% is **testing**. As with the chores, it's not super fun and being tidy helps minimize the time it takes, but it's mandatory. Even if you have dedicated QA, you at least check your own work yourself; my current team's workflow is: you test it-&gt;your teammate(s) test it-&gt;Jenkins integration-tests it on merge-&gt;QA tests it-&gt;end-users ~~test~~ ***use*** it. &amp;#x200B; I'd guesstimate **talking** to people comes down to something like an hour a day on average. This is work-talking, not watercooler-talking: standups, design discussions, meetings, knowledge sharing in either direction, coordinating with other teams, wrangling stakeholders/clients... again, depends on the employer. Freelance work might have more wrangling, a big company might have more meetings. I'm not sure whether to count written communications as well here. Either way, those people skills aren't gonna atrophy one way or another. &amp;#x200B; Whatever's left is covered by figuring out priorities, coming up with colorful invectives against InfluxDB, code reviews, waiting for the damn computer to unfreeze from running four PyCharm windows at once, making coffee, and other small joys of life. &amp;#x200B; As a caveat, I mostly had contact with fairly lean teams or solo work in relatively relaxed environments. FAANG, non-tech transnationals, and early-stage startups are liable to have their own local color that I hadn't experienced myself yet.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere\_on\_Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth)
**Anywhere on Earth** Anywhere on Earth (AoE) is a calendar designation which indicates that a period expires when the date passes everywhere on Earth. The last place on Earth where any date exists is on Howland and Baker islands, in the IDLW time zone (the West side of the International Date Line), and so is the last spot on the globe for any day to exist. Therefore, the day ends AoE when it ends on Howland Island.The convention originated in IEEE 802.16 balloting procedures. At this point, many IEEE 802 ballot deadlines are established as the end of day using "AoE", for "Anywhere on Earth" as a designation. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
I'm a big fan of [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). The community edition is free to use for personal projects!
I would advise against using '*player*' and '*computer*' as variable names for storing their respective actions, in general. I often don't remember the specifics of my own code after coming back to it after three weeks; to say nothing of *someone else* trying to read it. So, when you're trying to remember what you've been trying to do, and have to parse a line like \`if player == computer\` in more complicated code, you're gonna waste a lot of effort figuring out the intent behind the code, whereas you could have called the variable something like '*player\_action*' and be done with it forever with an extra minute of work tops.
&gt; Well, sorry but thats really far from true. When I cut down the search space, how is that making problem harder ? Then it's not a constraint. A constraint is something like don't go over 2000 calories or don't get more than 40% fat. You eat say 2500 calories per day, so butter is allowed, but just not 40% of calories from butter (assuming no fat in anything else)_. Limiting the data set is just that, a reduction of data. It does not participate in the optimization problem. The specific example you used was: &gt; Another constraint is to not allow any nutrient to occur more than say 1.5x of what is recommended If you interpret that on a 10 day basis, then you can't go over 15 days worth. Maybe you're trying to limit based on 1.5x the RDA on a per day per serving basis, but you can just eat 1/2 a serving per day or eat it every other day. Given your 10 day criteria, a 1.5x per day per serving and we're only considering whole servings seems more than you want. If you do the 1.5x/day/serving, then it's a data set reduction. If you're limiting it to no more than 1.5x of such and such nutrient over 10 days, then it's a constraint and that would make the problem harder. Another example of a constraint is only consider servings that are multiples of 0.1. That makes it much harder of a problem than using a continuous variable.
Whichever one you like.
11.69 has to be a typo. They meant 11.59 in the AoE timezone.
Well shit. Now I just feel dumb. Oh well :(
Best outcome.
Is it really CPU intensive tasks and not Memory intensive tasks? As far as i understand the Python internals, everything is a point/reference, so for each double we will have an extra memory lookup (and as Python makes sure that if two doubles have the same value, they point to the same internal object) the resulting lookups are not really friendly for memory access which then slows down the Python Code by much. Numpy probably goes around this with internal Arrays in C and thus is much faster?
I'm taking a Udemy course: REST APIs with Flask and Python. Looking for ideas for an API to build as a beginner project. Ideally I'd like to create something actually useful. So far my only idea involves pictures of my cat &gt;.&lt;
Fuck off with your blogspam.
Hello! I'm a bot! It looks to me like your post might be better suited for r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. That said, I am a bot and it is hard to tell. Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster.

Is that kid casually wearing soccer cleats around?
Even from scratch wouldn't it be pretty basic calculus to optimize for the minimum cost? I don't understand how to use scipy good enough to make these problems trivial! I need to look into them more...could probably help me with school work.
I use VSCode with the extension for Python.
They look like flat soled futsal shoes. Still weird to wear as everyday shoes though lol
You should use pip to install the missing libraries, as in 'pip install matplotlib'.
Right now I'm just working on research for an idea I have, because I'm having a really hard time describing what I want in a Google search to find good results. I was going to make a post just now, but I saw this thread and figured I'd start here. I'm open to everything, including module suggestions, existing projects that work similarly to what I want to do, framework suggestions, etc. Anything to get me closer, because I'm not having much luck trying to find what I'm wanting to do. Short description is I want to create a "room" where people can connect and share audio clips, which will play in synch to everyone in the "room." Think of those services that let a room of people watch a YouTube video in synch, i.e. if one user pauses, it pauses for everyone, and when playback starts, it starts for everyone, etc. My friend and I make music, and as of now, when we're working on something and want to share it with each other, either for suggestions or to show what we just finished, we upload the clip(s) to SoundCloud, and either delete them when we're done or set them to private. That works fine, but I wanted to make something where we could make a temporary room, upload audio clips (either .wav or .mp3 files), and when we hit play, it plays for everyone currently connected, in unison. Then, when nobody else is in the room, it'll just delete the room and any files that were uploaded. I'm a hobbyist, and not a particularly gifted programmer, but I do feel like this is something that would be possible, even with my current skills. Yet I'm having a lot of trouble finding any kind of resources or similar projects on Google, without being pointed back to open source discord bots, which isn't what I want to do. I'm also open to JavaScript, although I'd prefer doing it in Python as a learning experience.
That seems pretty cool! I don't have much else to say besides that, but thanks for sharing :)
For the UI part, I did a lot of searching a while ago and remember that Tk and PyQT were the "go-to" UI toolkits most people were recommending. Not sure how much that helps, since I never ended up pursuing it. The other option, if it even is an option, is a web interface, but that's an awful lot of unnecessary overhead.
Tattoo looks bad but the matching shoes. Sooo good.
Good stuff. Have an updewt on me :)
Things I know how to do in Oracle but are simpler in Python. Like applying logic, shaping (pivot) time series data, and a few cases where joins would work in Oracle but are just easier with pandas and merging dataframes. It's probably personal preference more than doing "the impossible" but I so appreciate pandas for making my life easier.
You may have to config your browsers to use your veiwer and I'm not sure it will work with page embedded viewers; maybe following the opposite of these bits of advice will work? &amp;#x200B; [https://apemobile.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001569212-PDF-files-are-downloading-instead-of-displaying-in-web-browser-or-opening-in-a-new-tab](https://apemobile.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001569212-PDF-files-are-downloading-instead-of-displaying-in-web-browser-or-opening-in-a-new-tab) &amp;#x200B; [https://helpx.adobe.com/ca/acrobat/kb/pdf-browser-plugin-configuration.html](https://helpx.adobe.com/ca/acrobat/kb/pdf-browser-plugin-configuration.html)
Do you always use the same program to open the PDF? If so, I'd probably do it like user `hopemeetme` mentions. Associate the pdf extension with your own script. Then your script and adjust the PDF and then open it in your own reader. If you're wanting the ability to use any program, you're in for a much harder time. You'll have to use a GUI automation tool (pywinauto, pyautogui are a couple of popular ones) of some sort to watch the different programs that could possibly open the PDF, and then when they open whichever type of PDF you're looking for, the GUI automation script can kick off the PDF adjustments and then force the program to reload the PDF so it can reflect your changes.
Where can I get it?

If you really want to learn it, install it on a pc or mac. Having it on your phone just isn’t going to allow you to do nearly enough to learn it.
True, she had gotten a laptop but it’s slow and I’ve looked into upgrading her ram and get her a more dedicated hard drive but her laptop is a different model than what I found for, thanks for the tip.
