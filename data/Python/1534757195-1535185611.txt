What? Lol. I can't even think of a legitimate case where this would be true.
Am I the only one that thinks this problem should be solved in another way? If this is a coworker and you are generating production code based on circumventing his idiosyncracies...the future will not like you. If you are checking in to a common repo somewhere, run some plagiarism-detection code on it. Anything but making code harder to read just because of one guy.

The ethical thing to do is to not work for a thief.
Exactly. This post confused me. I would expect all production code, regardless of bu or team to be in GitHub. You can fuck right off if you'd expect to interact with me any other way. I remember the days of getting compiled ddls from another team that were promised to 'just work'. They never worked as advertised and I'd end up having to reverse engineer the implimentstion details using softice and a shit ton of breakpoints. These days most of our code base is python which allows me to peak under the hood and see the implimentstion , any ddls are provided as source and compiled on the Jenkins build box. It's so much easier to work across teams. Tl/Dr. Op is solving the wrong problem. The issue is some guy is taking credit for another's work. That's the issue, not code visibility

You’ll need to fix the indenting issues but that code should work
Sometimes the devil has to work for you
The whole project relies on a program he has but could be my computer too.
Not a Git repo, I’m talking about a private project. He is no working with me he is the end user.
Short answer, you cant. You can make it more difficult but even commercial software with hundreds of engineers can be decompiled to varying degrees
It will slow him down (which is all security is about), so what really matters is the value of your code. If you think what you're doing is well worth taking days or weeks (depending on experience and size) to reverse the binary and painfully understand each aspect in order to rewrite code that does the same thing, then it's not enough, you'll need more (and that won't be very easy to get from python). Furthermore, while he may get the algorithm back, he won't get the source code itself. Meaning any comment and such will be lost. Those are not generally what you're trying to protect, but it's good to know. tl;dr: Don't think for a minute it's impossible to get back, but it'll be much harder than copy-pasting. It's a good deterent but if he's motivated enough he may pull through.
When you don't build the module yourself, you should use the "psycopg2-binary" module -&gt; http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/install.html#binary-install-from-pypi
Sounds like an interesting approach. Probably would have to be somehow recursive because of the second assignment... Let me answer all your questions with a clear "because!" Like I said, it's just to learn the limitations of the language. And after all, it's pure curiosity. I occasionally have students that ask weird questions like this. Now I can tell them, yes, you can do it like this and that but every time you do it, Monty murders a little puppy. 
You might be able to use this tool I heard about: https://github.com/Falldog/pyconcrete/ Although I would still suggest turning your code into a web app as suggested above. I’m not sure what the reliance is, but I can imagine how it would be hard if this other program needs to run the python, like blender. However a web app may still a possible solution. In that case your web app would need a python api library that you don’t mind distributing because it just knows how to call your web app that does the real/hidden work.
1400 views and no comments :-) ?
What kind of background tasks are you running in your webapp if you don't mind me asking.
And you can't execute this program also on the cloud?
Tabs is bad practice because it is by definition inconsistent with the vast majority of python code written, and inconsistent with ALL standards-compliant python code.
I would suggest adding some examples that use context managers. good stuff. 
&gt; If I'm going for native replacement, why on earth would I use something like asyncio? I can have normal threads / user-space threads / transactional memory / CSP / whatever other parallelism solution available out there. The only reason I can imagine for using something like uvloop, is that if you are incompetent in any other language (and, probably, not so good at Python), and so you are afraid of doing the right thing, instead, you want something that would not require from you to learn anything. What the hell are you talking about? Asyncio is more than just an event loop and primitives. uvloop provides a drop in replacement for asyncio's default event loop. You hook in uvloop's event loop policy and you're off to the races-- import asyncio import uvloop.asyncio.set_event_loop_policy(uvloop.EventLoopPolicy()) It doesn't not replace any of the other asyncio api. &gt; By whom? By the clowns who wrote asyncio? Why should their opinion be of any consequence to me. I think that people who wrote asyncio shouldn't touch computers at all, their time would be better spent installing air conditioners or acting in an improvisational theater. No...by the core dev team who implemented the internal python recognition for coroutines and decided on all the magic methods and their implications. More specifically, writer of PEP 492 and 525. But you should have piped up back then if you thought it was silly. Did you? &gt; Well, the way asyncio works depends on bytecode interpreter, you cannot make a C function async, there's no mechanism for that (while, in principle, there's no reason why there shouldn't be). It's the defective design of asyncio that requires that all code down the call stack from where the loop was started be a generator, and that Python's interpreter manage it. Obviously, that's in principle incompatible with how C extensions interact with Python. I'm *pretty sure* a standard C extension API for async functions was written, so I'm confused why this is an issue.
Typically sending emails, hitting external APIs to send notifications, that sort of thing. Those are fire and forget jobs where I don’t necessarily need to check the result. For a few things, I’m using multiple workers to speed up an expensive operation where the results are returned in the same request - aggregating the results of multiple HTTP requests or some other kind of I/O. In one app I need to trigger a long running db query that removes stale data. I’m using a ThreadPoolExecutor there, so it’s easy to throw the job into the executor whenever needed.

Does your code need to be even remotely fast? [You could try using the movfuscator on your C code.](https://github.com/xoreaxeaxeax/movfuscator) I doubt he'd ever be able to reverse engineering that.
I’m just curious what is the relationship between you and the other guy here? You said he was an end user in another post. So does that mean he’s hiring you/your company to do this work? Does it mean you’re working on a school project and he’s the guy on your team that’s going to run the end code for whatever reason? Is he a coworker? Classmate? TA?
I think OP is worried his client is going to just disappear as soon as he gets the source code.

I'm a backend python developer, Postgres is our relational db technology, and we'd **never** directly use the psycopg2 driver API. SQLAlchemy (along with alembic) is an objectively better choice. It lets you use the psycopg2 driver and makes doing everything easier, more pythonic, more configurable, and more maintainable. It also supports other db's, so it's very easy to change technologies if you choose to down the road.
Yes. But you should be aware to the drive used by SQlAlchemy in the background to communicate with DBs. It will help you in debugging and understanding of a code. 
Not really, the whole point of a wrapper module like SQLAlchemy is that it abstracts away the calls of the underlying drivers so you don't need to worry about them. I've worked with SQLAlchemy and Postgres on production applications for years and I've never once needed to know what the driver was doing under the hood for "debugging" or any other reason.

Why? It’s not obligatory to use github
Absolutely. If you can easily avoid thing sin your code that make a reader pause and say "..The hell is this?" or even just have to spend extra time to mentally parse it then you should do so. 
https://automatetheboringstuff.com/
Download Python 3.6+ 64bit. (This is the raw python interpreter) Then download Spyder (This is an IDE) (You can also download anaconda GUI and use Spyder through there). I suggest you then start going through some tutorials to try to understand how python works.
I’m not talking about GitHub. Just source control. Git is a great option. Git doesn’t require github, either. 
thanks, i will give them a look
thanks dude, is there any way to download it??
In your current code, you only have lists (python name for a possibly inhomogenious array). When you do the assignment, you overwrite the strings, e.g. 'stat1' with the numeric value when you do the assignment. You don't really need two lists and a loop over the index. The more natural choice of data structure would be a dictionary where you could retrive the stat value with the stat name as the key. In this process, you can even drop the stat1, stat2, .... and index them directly by their names. I'd suggest something like this: stat_group = ["Strength","Dexterity","Constitution","Intelligence","Wisdom","Charisma"] stats = dict.fromkeys(stat_group) print('Stats have been rolled.') rolls = list(range(1, 6)) for key in stats.keys(): dice_rolls = np.random.choice(rolls, 4) stats[key] = np.sum(dice_rolls) - np.min(dice_rolls) print(sorted(dice_rolls)) print(f'{key} {stats[key]}')

I'm pretty new to python as well but had a friend recently tell me to create a Python bot to automate something in my life. So I created a python bot that schedules my workouts for me. I now never have to set alarms for certain times to make sure I'm in certain classes. It's great. I used Python, Selenium, and the [schedule](https://github.com/dbader/schedule) module. Put it in a docker container and sent it to now.sh.
I love registering my own composite types with psycopg2. Is not hard and does 99% of what people use ORMs to do, and is really fast.
oh, i will try something like that, thanks dudee
Interesting. However, is there a particular reason to use [Socket.IO](https://Socket.IO) instead of just plain WebSockets? I've found that the protocol provides zero value-add in a modern browser and causes some latency and reliability issues.
Thank you so much. That is so much shorter than what I had previously. Is there a way to sort the output of the rolls before they get assigned to the stat\_group? I'm thinking it would be easiest to rename the stat\_group list to "stat1", etc. This way, I can sort it in either ASC or DSC so that I can have something similar to below functional. This would enable me to carry the value elsewhere in the program. Example, Warlock would want to get the stat5 (Wisdom) and stat6 (Charisma) as the highest rolled stats, but as it is currently, it would just get the 5\^th and 6\^th result of the loop. `player_class="Warlock"` `stat_main="Wisdom"` `stat_sec="Charisma"`
Solution Verified
okay, thanks
This is a standard way to do things, its better than nothing, but with a bit of google searching and a bit of work, he'll reverse engineer it, although its painful and unpleasant work, few would do it unless there is good payoff involved! I would suggest, trying some non standard way on top this to obfuscate the code.
The limitations of what can be done, in any language, are always 100% theoretical.
Nevermind, just read the part about platform dependency. Need to make my Fmt string like this: `&gt;&gt;&gt; Fmt = '=Q64shhffIBBB32sH'` `&gt;&gt;&gt; calcsize(Fmt)` `125` :-)
Break the problem down into tiny little chunks. Can you figure out how to, in Python: 1. Read a text file (or Excel spreadsheet? CSV file?) into memory? 2. Iterate it line by line 3. Print out the exact values from it that you want 4. Authenticate and connect to your SQL database (is it SQL Server? MySQL? Oracle?) 5. Run an INSERT statement into your database? 6. Build an INSERT statement based on the values from your file iterator and extractor, then execute the statement? 7. Do something useful if an error on INSERTion, or reading the file, happens? (Exception handling) If you can do each of these tiny little steps, then all that's left is to glue them all together! To figure out how to do each of your tiny little steps, Google will help you. Google, experiment, repeat.
Okay then, let's see what the practical limitations are. ;-) 
You are right. Might be a bad example... 
[under my breath] *holy shit*
I've been working on AWS Lambda project that needs to use postgres, and I've opted for pg8000 for the simple fact that's infinitely easier to bundle pg8000 with a lambda function than psycopg. I've gotten extremely good results from pg8000, it's an excellent library.
Step one. Quit drooling on the keyboard. 
The community info of this subreddit contains plenty of resources. My recommendation is to start learning the basics from Dive Into Python 3, see http://www.diveintopython3.net You quickly get the idea of Python from there, without a lot of formality about memory heaps, stacks, disk etc which some courses put up front. Then after a few chapters you have the fundamentals. Now you start writing, and thanks to its large user community you can find a lot of practical nifty tips, methods, libraries and hacks for specific problems by searching on Stackoverflow, see https://stackoverflow.com If all you look to do is simple scripting, then this will often suffice. Bigger or more complex tasks are helped by additional study, textbooks or courses.
I feel sorry for someone trying to decompile that.
Isn't it disgustingly wonderful? My favorite part is how it can use `mov` for flow control, thereby eliminating all `jmp`s.
Thanks for the tip.
1. When you already know Postgres and already have your raw SQL ready to go, and all you need is a simple wrapper to plug everything into. 2. When you'd prefer to troubleshoot issues with Postgres instead of issues with your wrapper. It's much easier to find support for raw SQL. You can always steal queries from stackoverflow without having to convert them for your code. This is especially true when dealing with older versions of Postgres. It's also nice to be able to copy/paste/tweak your query between your code and pgadmin when you can't figure out why it's not doing what you want.
If you read the parent comment they explicitly mentioned those things 
Yeah, but _after_ they pay though. OP's concern is legit, but it's the kind of thing you'd normally guard against with decent contracts and not working for dickheads.
I think this, or spark, is really the only way to go. I've tried parallelizing apply before, and it seems to invariably run slower than vanilla apply. 
Yeah, I know there’s no persistence - that’s acceptable for my use cases. It doesn’t deal with the other concerns you raised, but no reason it couldn’t! I added the bare minimum features to meet my needs in prod, but there’s plenty of room for improvement :)
Love it! Though I feel that SQL injection sanitization needs to be considered a basic and should be on this list. It's easy enough that anyone can understand and it's egregious enough that no one should be needlessly vulnerable. 
Yeah, you really need the underlying data structure to support the parallelisation - if you're using data large enough that you need to parallelise over it, you're using data too large to pickle significant chunks of it.
For a psycopg2 port to [cffi](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) have a look at: https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2cffi/ Will allow you access to your db using pypy. SQLAlchemy can also use the driver.
my apologies, did not know of that sub
They aren't really. (Says me, the OP) The article gives a nice high level view on generators. 
For games, I think Kivi has a nice drawing API.

Honestly, just learn `git`/GitHub. It's the right tool for the job, you'll need to learn it at some point, and at the end of the day there's only a few things you need to know how to do. [Their tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) is pretty good.
I would suggest to use git. Git is not really simple but: 1. Vs code already has a git UI built in. 2. You probably will never come across the situations which make git difficult if you are only working alone. [how to git](https://githowto.com) is a good starting point — at least it was for me. 3. Git is the technology used by GitHub. So if you ever want to use GitHub it is easy to do.
Started a visual novel using ren'py but planning on making some sort of text-web RPG. It's going to be dope. But I'm still learning so there's that
Thank you for noticing I have added proper exception message in other examples. In the first two examples I have added this generic message. I have tested and it's working. Now added in first two. 
Why would you want to do that?
I would be asking: why? Considering privacy etc. this seems to be a no go, so what is your preferred use of this module? 
Gonna be honest. This whole situation reads as 'sketch as fuck'.
Git is the correct answer here. Personally I'm almost 100% command line with git, but also use GitKraken when I need to fix something really bad (like the mess you get when multiple people change a Qt ui file on 6 seperate branches. That was a fun merge). Luckily you don't need to be concerned with most of the more difficult git things, because it's just you.
It doesn't seem like your app is actually taking advantage of the event loop, except for the call to \`asyncio.sleep()\` in your async handler. I haven't worked with Celery but based on my cursory research, it appears that 4.x doesn't use asyncio (though this is purportedly coming in 5.0). This means that all the IO-bound work done by the Celery library – in your web server's case, communicating with Redis – is blocking and doesn't yield to the event loop. Your web server's flow is something like this: 1. Receive request 2. Serialize Celery task to JSON 3. Send task info to Redis 4. Wait for task to be completed 5. Receive task result from Redis 6. Deserialize result from JSON 7. Send response All of this blocks the event loop. Most of these steps are CPU-bound anyway (1, 2, 6, and 7), but 3 - 5 could be made asynchronous. It sounds like this is what Celery's developers have in mind for 5.0, but it's unclear when or if that version will actually be released; see [https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/4016](https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/4016). Your call to \`asyncio.sleep()\` falls between 1 and 2, but it's not actually accomplishing anything other than making your responses slower. Each time through the loop, the handler has to sleep *before* it can kick off and receive the result of the Celery task. The sleep isn't happening while you wait for results; it's a totally separate thing. Most of the time you don't actually want to call \`asyncio.sleep()\`. If you want to give up control of the event loop while you wait for Redis IO, you need an asyncio-based Redis client that uses \`async\`/\`await\`. Personally I'm partial the excellent [aioredis](https://aioredis.readthedocs.io/en/v1.1.0/) library, but as far as I can tell Celery doesn't support drop-in replacement of its Redis driver. You'd have to rewrite a substantial portion of the Celery library itself, which it sounds like is what they're planning for version 5.
Following me where? I just added a bunch of stuff, though, esp. statically adding Chromecasts and a bunch of fixes
I suspect the easiest method would be to generate random points in a bounding box, then test if they are inside by testing the tray formed by the point and the volume centric against all triangles. If your shape isn't convex you will need to keep track of the ordering of intersections.
I see. So in this version, I would just vary the ordered_stat_group per class, as opposed to doing a priority listing and it would sort them into the correct order based off of the placement of each stat? Thank you soo much! This works perfectly for me.
I appreciate the edit, but you're still catching all errors with `except Exception...` which is bad practice.
Correct me if I am wrong, but that method will only work if the polygon has some 'volume' to it and since I am looking at a purely planar polygon, the probability that any random point lies inside is zero.

Cool little script! Here are a few tips I think can benefit your code: 1. When you use a for-loop, [you should iterate over the actual iterable](https://docs.quantifiedcode.com/python-anti-patterns/readability/using_an_unpythonic_loop.html), rather than the range(len(iterable)). The former is generally regarded as more readable. If you need the actual index for what you're doing, you should use Python's built-in [enumerate](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate). 2. You should follow a style guide, preferably [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). In short, capitalize the first letter of your comments, "Token" should be all lowercase, "id" should be renamed since it shares the same name as a built-in, and you should reconsider your use of a bare "except" statement. An IDE like PyCharm can remind you of these things. 3. A for-loop that constructs a list can normally be simplified as a list comprehension. [Here's part of your code](https://gist.github.com/AN3223/7edc3f8aefaf0f19eb6e52794b4a70ab) rewritten as a list comprehension, and [here's a resource](https://www.smallsurething.com/list-dict-and-set-comprehensions-by-example/) that explains how list/dict/set comprehensions work.
Also, I did a lot of these as a beginner too, so don't feel let down, it's normal!
I have to agree with you here
Well, that doesn't change things appreciably. With your implementation and the limitations of Celery, you can expect more or less identical performance from the synchronous endpoint across all Python web frameworks, regardless of whether they use the event loop. The work is largely CPU-bound and the IO-bound components are not asynchronous. If you test the async endpoint that calls `sleep()`, you might actually see slightly improved throughput due to the framework's ability to start handling other requests while the handler is sleeping. Ultimately, though, that's sort of a red herring.
We use TortoiseGit at work and it connects to VS Code seamlessly, you can keep everything localy and I'd recommend Git over SVN. 
I see. Yeah, you can go ahead and leverage whatever you'd like! PM me if you have any questions.
Can you provide more detail on what the service is supposed to do? If you have to compute a new result for every request before you can issue a response, what are you gaining by using Celery to do the computation? It seems like your request handling and analytics processing are coupled pretty tightly. It's not clear that a messaging queue is actually buying you better performance than you'd get just doing the processing inline, but I don't know enough about what you're trying to accomplish to say for sure. We can take this to PM if you don't want to discuss publicly.
It just comes across as fucking creepy.
How did you install Jupyter? What OS? Have you installed the fonts to the system? Does your environment have access to them... We need more info. 
Seriously. The military just punted me some Python code to integrate into our larger tool. They gave me pycs. Alright, I'll just run decompyle on it, so I can actually interface with it...it's not perfect regarding indentation, but it's good enough to figure things out.
I’m okay with it. So here’s what I want to do 1. User sends a request which might have the actual data or a redis key from where I would have to retrieve data 2. Once I convert it into a required format (mostly a cleaner data frame) I run my algorithm which is mostly numerical analysis 3. I create an output JSON and return to the user as a response This is what the flow should be. Mummy analysis is quick ~2-3 seconds but the input files may go upto 13-14MB that’s why I want to give the flexibility to also transfer data as a redis key. 
That code is a pretty rough spot. Somethings just jump right out. 1. This is creepy 2. There's all sorts of weird indenting and PEP failures 3. There's no real abstraction of any kind. 4. The way methods are broken up seems completely arbitrary. 5. Print statements all over the place 6. It seems like this should be a CLI application and not a library, but there's no entry point? 7. I didn't spend more than a minute or two glancing at this, but it could sure use some cleanup. 
Note: Experience much better on desktop / laptop, with private browsing / incognito turned off! Also, you can browse through the source code here if you'd like: [https://github.com/danielv775/Weatherly](https://github.com/danielv775/Weatherly)
I wrote my own little Makefile that sets up an virtual environment, install jupyter and all dependencies and templates a systemd user service file: https://github.com/klingtnet/jupyterlab-setup/ It looks like installing jupyterlab through pip will only install STIX-WEB fonts for Mathjax: ls venv/lib/python3.7/site-packages/notebook/static/components/MathJax/fonts/HTML-CSS STIX-Web
No it does not. What makes you think it does?
thanks for your feedback, this helps me a lot. I'll try to change it in the following days.
Thank you for your feedback, zackkitzmiller. I thought people would be concerned with privacy, even though It would run locally. I understand why people get creeped out. For the PEP, I think I need to fix it. The weird errors are caused by SQL_commands which are longer than 80 lines. Print statements are only in one section that has only five lines, i think you just judged the code based on the output of PEP test program. I think you are right that It does not really have abstraction... It might be better off with other applications than a module. I'm considering to take the module down since people are so creeped out about it. Thank you for the feedback! 
I mean, I didn't run a linter against this. It's very easy to see that there are dozens of violations, even just at a glace. PEP8 exists for a reason. Print statements are always bad news, breakpoints for debugging, a real logger for logging. There are cases where `print` is fine, but it looks like you're just trapping an error there. 
I still find posts like these awe inspiring... Just beautiful :)
Any Python program running on your PC now has an easy way to access all of your browser history if you use any of the supported browsers. OP may have good intentions here, but you can't ensure that everyone using this library will. Advertisers would love to buy this kind of information, because it tells them where you spend most of your time (i.e. what sites to put the high-profit ads on) and what you're interested in. Any dev could slip a little script in a minor update that pulls all of that information and sends it off to their server where they can now collate it and sell it off.

I started using Python around 2008 and have never used the print statement. I don't understand why would anyone want to write code that's not forward compatible, especially when it's so easy to do.
Yes it does. And it makes you look like some half-witted-masturbatory-jack-weasel. It's an obvious violation of people's privacy and could be used for invasive or sinnister means.
So this isn't an actual 3D polyhedron, just a flat 2D polygon with some arbitrary 3D rotation/orientation? If so, it is isomorphic to the normal 2D case, so you can simply generate random points in that and then transform them to the corresponding location in the oriented shape.
In ten years they may have robbed already thousands of hours from human lives ... I know if it's important, use parentheses; if I'm just debugging or fiddling around, no no no please no ... Must have been said to death but this is paternalistic and just plain time robbery... Can't I `from __past___ import print_function` ??? :P It's ok, just the 73th error about missing () after print just turnd me rage mode Should have sticked with 2. whatever, not in the mood for exploration, need expoitation.
Yes, it is a simple flat polygon. &gt; If so, it is isomorphic to the normal 2D case, so you can simply generate random points in that and then transform them to the corresponding location in the oriented version. Oh ok. I had difficulty figuring out how exactly to do that. Will try again.
I'm a little confused, Should I delete this module from Pypi Index?
Yeah, it's very much a math problem as you thought, specifically linear algebra. If you're generating these oriented shapes by rotating an initially flat shape, it should be trivial to apply the same transformation to a given random point within. If you're just starting off with a randomly oriented shape, you'll first need to generate a matrix that can transform it to an appropriate flat orientation. The inverse of that matrix can then be used on any subsequent points you generate in the flat shape to obtain its corresponding 3D coordinates.
&gt; Can't I `from __past___ import print_function` ??? :P No, because in python 2 it was a statement, not a function, which means you can't do anything clever with it. One of a number of reasons the developers chose to use a function going forward.
Do you left shift or right shift when you type `()` ? I use my little finger on right shift and press 9 and 0 with my index finger.
SDL is what you want then via SDL_rects, iirc there is bitmap support as well as draw routines, if you truly want low level OpenGL, or if you got some stones Vulkan. If you only care about windows DirectX. OpenGL though works practically everywhere. SDL iirc is built on top of OpenGL. Vulkan is probably too low level. SDL will probably be what you are looking for.
I’m definitely adding this to my list of things to check out later. 
I don't think you should delete this. Anyone that really wants to do it, will find a way to do it. I believe that coding a tool is a great way to learn + it helped you. The code wasn't that clean and it needed improvement which is exactly why people put stuff on GitHub. The community should help you, not say that it's creepy. There are bunch of hacking tools on GitHub too. Researchers use them for the good and someone may for the opposite, but sharing your hard work - to get better - is the right thing.
But it's not reliable - doesn't work sometimes.
the point is that it wasn't a function and that was wrong.
if you can do it in 2D, then just do that and apply the transform that's already been applied to the polygon to place it in 3D space.
&gt;If you have a decent understanding of assembly, binaries and patience, you have a fair chance at reversing binaries. It doesn't take a literal expert Yes, you're right, it depends on the definition of "experienced". To me, being able to effectively reverse-engineer a compiled code is something few people know how to do it. Out of 100 software developers, how many of them can? Regarding to the OP problem, a guy that "has a tendency to steal code" probably can be stopped by the Python byte code alone.
Thank you, M4DR4T for your words. I decided to make the module while working on my data analysis project that takes browser histories as datasets. I thought some people might want to look at their browsing history in csv files or in a python object. I need to fix a lot for the module, but that's a way to learn python. Thank you again.
With pip. [https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) Check out virtualenv too.
A guy provided you the source and you have to manually run the code in the module, why are you acting like hw added a binary blob to every computer on earth lol
You have to run it yourself and the source code is right there, both on github and on your pc if you install it via pip.
SDL wrapper, PyGame, should do it for you.
I don't understand why everyone is piling up on you, i thought that i was in a wrong sub for a moment. Your program is fine concerning privacy, you are not forcing anyone to run it or hiding it in some other app.
This post is better suited for r/learnpython
Only programmers can get so worked up about something so stupid. (I kid) (because it's not just programmers)
Think about it like this: your handler will never be faster than the slowest piece of work it must complete to send a response. If you have to do a fresh analysis on every input, and that analysis takes 2 seconds, then *the fastest possible* response time for your service is 2 seconds. More, when you account for network latency and other overhead costs. Async processing (via a task queue or any other mechanism) doesn’t change this. What it does improve is *concurrency*. You can start handling new requests while you wait for the results for in-flight requests. But this only works if the waiting step can be done without blocking. This is crucial; otherwise you might as well just make the whole thing synchronous. The next question is: can anything be done to speed up the analysis step? Let's assume the actual computation is already as fast as it can be. Whether you can make your service faster depends on two factors: 1. Is your analysis deterministic? A process is deterministic iff it always produces the same result given the same input (like a hash function). 2. Do you get multiple requests with identical inputs? If the answers to both of these questions are yes, then you can get a huge performance improvement by caching the results of your analysis. Redis is perfect for this. You can use a hash of the input data as the key (or part of the key) and store the result JSON as the value. You'll incur the computation cost the first time you're asked to analyze a given input, but subsequent requests with the same input will be as fast as a simple Redis get operation. If your analysis is not deterministic (e.g. it depends on the time at which it is computed) or you’re only ever asked to analyze a given piece of data once, caching won’t help you. Either way, Celery in its current state isn't doing you any favors. Its synchronous architecture means your web server is blocked waiting for your worker(s) to compute results, and can't handle other requests in the mean time. You might as well just do the computation directly in your handler – in fact, you'll probably shave off a few milliseconds by eliminating the overhead of communicating with Redis. It's possible to implement a simple task queue entirely in Redis, using pub/sub (to notify workers of new tasks and the web server of results) and some additional storage (for the queue itself, inputs, and results). Using a library like aioredis means you won’t be blocking the event loop while you wait for results. If that's too complicated, you might explore alternative queuing systems. Amazon's SQS is easy to work with, and you can use [aiobotocore](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiobotocore) to make the networking calls play nicely with the event loop. There's also RabbitMQ, for which several asyncio-compatible drivers exist (though I don't have any experience working with RabbitMQ so I can't speak to its effectiveness).
Home from work, muhahaha Jk, your username on here I cloned it yesterday and realized it's going to take some thinking. It's an early phase, I get it, don't worry.
Github is just a centralized server which provides issue tracking and is integrated with Git as version control tool . However, git is distributed. That is that you can perfectly create a local repository and use it without any server where to push your work. You can put in place a simplistic workflow with it: here is an example (i have to use pastebin as the text is too long). [https://pastebin.com/Wff9Z1xw](https://pastebin.com/Wff9Z1xw) For your convenience you can use graphical clients to get the same workflow. For instance you can use these locally: [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/) [https://www.atlassian.com/blog/archives/introducing-sourcetree-git-client-microsoft-windows](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/archives/introducing-sourcetree-git-client-microsoft-windows) If you really do't want to use git, her are the most popular alternative (although they are distributed, that is you commit locally in your repository and synchronise remotely your repository if you wish only) [https://www.mercurial-scm.org/](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/) and this one is very simple and complet as it provides a graphical client, wiki and an issue tracker out of the box. [http://www.fossil-scm.org/index.html/doc/2010-01-01/www/index.wiki](http://www.fossil-scm.org/index.html/doc/2010-01-01/www/index.wiki) If you prefer a centralized tool (your working directory is local and the repository is remote) you can use [https://subversion.apache.org/](https://subversion.apache.org/) But the installation is more complex as you need a web server. But remember, if you wish to share your work with other stakeholders and cooperate, Git is the de-facto tool.
Working on a multithreaded chatroom. Hoping to implement server-side admin features such as whitelisting/kicking/banning/etc once I get it running smoothly.
No, dummy. What I was missing is the “=“ at the beginning of the format string. Seems like you should read the docs.
&gt; What the hell are you talking about? Dude... you have no idea where you are going with this. `uvloop` is a C library, well, a binding to `libuv`. The point is, if I am replacing something from Python's built-ins, there is no reason to choose `libuv`, unless you are some kind of masochist. This library was written having in mind defective languages, like JavaScript or Python, where there's no parallelism, and they need some kind of replacement... but, if you are already going for a replacement, then why not do it right? Just use `pthreads` or write it in Rust, or whatever floats your boat. &gt; core dev team Yes, exactly, clowns. Why is this so strange? This is not the first stupid decision made by people who develop Python, and will not be the last. &gt; I'm pretty sure But you never tried. In fact, you, again, have no idea what you are talking about. Yes, you "can" implement async iterator and corotutine in C. The problem is, they are worthless, because of what I described above. The problem is that all of it is going to be managed by single-threaded Python's interpreter, which is pointless. You are still faced with the same choices you had in Python 2: either you comply with stupid interpreter, and run in single thread, or you release the lock, and then do what you want, just don't touch the Python's objects. But, with asyncio it's even worse because you have to relinquish the control of those object to the managing code.
Have you tried installing the relevant tex packages? Do it via the package manager not the virtualenv as it should just pull from your globally installed fonts. 
As others have noted, taking some time to learn Git is the best answer. I have seen some people use Dropbox as lightweight version control. You can recover older versions of files, restore deleted files, or undo deletion events. Note that Dropbox only stores previous versions of files for 30 days on free/basic plans and it lacks many features one would expect from version control. [https://www.dropbox.com/help/security/version-history-overview](https://www.dropbox.com/help/security/version-history-overview) If the choice is between nothing or Dropbox, then Dropbox *might* be okay. But I strongly recommend you have another try at Git. Good luck! [git - the simple guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
Thank you for your feedback, ccviper! I'll check PEP8 and post it to learnpython and learnprogramming. 
Ignore all the others. Fossil is super easy and I recommend it for this use case. Just add it to your build step and you'll be good to go.
No problem. Also maybe write a disclaimer on the post stating that the browser history is stored in a local file and is freely accessible. It seems people are clueless and think your script is actively monitoring their browsing habits and recording them lol
So what exactly am I doing here? assuming I'm using a virtualenv, I'm going to have a virtualenv in a directory separate from my checkout directory, and then each build, run pip to update the contents of the virtualenv directory, then copy the contents of site\_packages out of the virtualenv and into my deployment archive as I'm creating it? Is there a Jenkins plugin that does all this? I'm new to python and I'm a lazy-bones.
Do some research man. Sorry.
Check out Pyro https://pyro4.readthedocs.io What does pygame have to do with this subject?
Hate to break it to you but if you're running random stuff on your computer that you haven't vetted at all it could already have code to do this in. Any corporation wanting this feature could just pay someone like OP to write it for them.
Try pyinstaller?
Please explain how this is creepy? 
I take this code. Package it with one of my open source projects. Say [sixpack](https://github.com/sixpack/sixpack), some dev installs it locally for testing on the work laptop she’s issued. I don’t print the output, I send it to myself. I could also snag the users IP addy and anything else. Maybe the browser history has some security by obscurity URL in it. Mine now. It’s just got a creepy vibe to it. 
I also don’t think you should delete it. (I have a parent comment above somewhere) The queries esp are interesting. 
And how is this anything new that wasnt possible literally since browsers came out? Who says any random proprietary app on that developers computer doesnt already do this? Its just reading the history database file, this is not some breakthrough in hacking lol
Thank you for this. I was shocked for a second to say the least. This is clearly a project of someone learning python and asking for help, not someone with wrong intentions. If companies want to implement a technique to spy on the browser history of their users they would achieve that, with or without the help of OP! OP, you did everything right, don't be concerned!
Lol. No we don’t. Some people don’t realize that their browser history is easily accessible. Believe me. It just feels creepy. Doesn’t mean it’s nefarious. 
Why are you even here if you're just going to RTFM? I already found a solution to my problem, I was hoping for some criticism, but apparently this is the wrong place for that.
creepy: causing an unpleasant feeling of fear or unease. An emotion. Will very differ person to person. Similar to unsettling. I used to live in a house owned by John Wayne Gacy, in Bartlett, IL. It didn’t bother me at all. People came over and thought it was creepy. I’m not saying this was possible since browsers ‘came out’ (though it was, early browser like mosaic stores history in a proprietary binary format). And of course it isn’t hacking. I don’t see any buffer overflows or anything. 
No company would need anyones help with this lol this is trivial. But i actually feel bad for OP after reading this mess. They are very polite, both in the post in comments. Wrote everything up, nicely summarized and documented it on github, and then came here for code review and got raged on. Idk what to say honestly, apart from replying to everything and correcting some of the bullshit lol
But... why would you feel u pleasant with 2 lines of code reading a file and showing you whats inside it?
Why would someone feel creeped out about living in a serial killers house that ate little boys? Like.. That's just not at all weird. It's just a house. Sometimes emotion is just emotion. 
We are in a subreddit dedicated to a programming language and are vieweing a script that reads a file and prints the content. If this causes emotions akin to being in a serial killers house then i clearly took one or two wrong turns on this website.
I'm intermediate/expert python and my GF is a second grade teacher I could mess around with some stuff in my off time. What grade are you? What exactly do you want to automate? Any specifics would be great. Thanks 
[Never forget little Bobby Tables!](https://xkcd.com/327/)
I'm just gonna go ahead and delete my browser history right now.
But the package doesn't send the data anywhere..? I don't follow. You're just viewing your own data in a convenient machine readable format and can then do what you want with it. It's not like this guy invented reading a file off the disk, this is nothing new..?
Caps? Did you try doing that?
Nope. There is nothing new here. I'll I was saying is it has a weird vibe. It's also a one line change to send this data somewhere. And package it in a open source project or whatever. I'm not saying it's nefarious, it just is like.. eh.. browser history is a thing that.. if at all possible, I think most people would prefer to not have leaked. I'm tried of explaining my emotions :(

There is a book called [Python Automate the Boring Stuff](https://www.amazon.com/Automate-Boring-Stuff-Python-Programming/dp/1593275994/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1534804377&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=python+automate+the+boring+stuff) that is a perfect starting point for using python to automate many common computing tasks relevant to most any job that involves a computer. 
What if you just want to write some basic scripts to perform a few quick database operations, and you don't have time to learn everything that SQLalchemy entails? In that case I just need a simple query builder and a driver that supports prepared statements.
I've never never never been able to get psycopg2 to work in anything other than IDLE. I always get the "no module named psycopg2._psycopg" error no matter what I do. reading about it on github the authors just say something like "well we don't guarantee that this works on anything other than Linux, so" very frustrating because psycopg2 is great for Redshift, and Redshift is where my company keeps all its data.
Have you considered using Docker?
How? This data is just sitting there anyways, why not have a python module that can extract it? 
Good stuff! I need to find time to try out the Quart web framework this guy built. An asyncio framework with a superset of the flask API.
I guess you could use it to calculate marks, record and visualise attendance using a graph, and see which student is weak at a certain subject etc.
&gt;Why are you even here if you're just going to RTFM? Likely because of what's in the sidebar: &gt;If you are about to ask a "how do I do this in python" question, please try r/learnpython or the Python discord. Looking things up is mostly what you'll be doing in the foreseeable able future (as anyone learning programming/a new language), so best get the practice in.
Forget pygame for now
Have you heard of cookiecutter?
Pygame is well documented, pySFML is simpler and faster but has worse documentation, Kivy is built on top of Pygame and provides lots of neat stuff, but requires you to learn a separate scripting/markup language
Have you looked at [ndgrader](https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)? 
Fine. I'm in the wrong sub.
r/learnpython 
Thank you :)

how I learned, first, read this https://python.swaroopch.com/ then do this, https://www.sololearn.com/Play/Python/ won't make you a pro, but you can cover the basics
Thanks :)
Unfortunately for OP, this is true. Make sure you find something that is designed for people with no coding experience. (Seriously.)
So, uhh, serious answer here. I used to teach undergrad classes. Now I'm a data scientist, and make twice the money...
Pick up the book "automate the boring stuff". It is great to get started on practical real world uses. 
Glad it can help. You can play with the csv files that are created by write_browserhistory_csv() with pandas' TimeSeries. I think browsing history is a good dataset to practice data analysis/visualization.

If you don't need all the power of SQLAlchemy, just don't use the pieces you don't need. Doing basic things like writing SQLAlchemy queries is incredibly easy and intuitive. Say you had this table (let's call it our **Person** table): id | name | age ---|---|---- 1 | Foo | 10 2 | Bar | 20 3 | FooBar | 5 # SQL query we are trying to run: SELECT * FROM Person WHERE name LIKE '%Bar' ORDER BY age; for result in session.query(Person).filter(Person.name.like("%Bar").order_by(Person.age).all(): print result &lt;Person(id=3, name="FooBar", age=5)&gt; &lt;Person(id=2, name="Bar", age=20)&gt; Spend 30 minutes reading [their tutorial](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/tutorial.html) and you will know all the basics you need to get started with SQLAlchemy, and you'll be set up with a solution you can later expand to be as powerful as you need it to be down the road.
Git is the right tool. There is free book: progit. 
Creating new process requires copying memory. So other process have to contain copy of your original data frame.
Definitely gonna try this out when I get home. I could see this being used in an application to break bad habits or something else.

In the PHP world there are many query builder packages that acheive what I mentioned previously that don't require me to spend 30 minutes reading through tutorials and do fit all their docs onto one page for ease of searching. I think it's perfectly reasonable to expect the same thing for python.
Great script, one thing I would like to add is, you can either use a dedicated argument parsing library (such as argparse) or add a specific exception when there are no arguments given instead of a broad and blank except clause.
Most use pycharm, myself included
There is nothing you can do except Homomorphic Computing, which is an open research question, but we got some really solid results last few years.
PyCharm, by JetBrains gets my vote. I also recommend their Java IDE, but the name of it escapes me right now.
This question has been asked so many times. A simple search of this subreddit and/or r/learnpython will yield more than enough results.
IntelliJ IDEA
Thanks, that's the one.
What kind of defaults? Default arguments to a function?
The reward for automating your work is... More work. I now have time to focus on less repetitive tasks. 
I really recommend Raymond Hettinger's talk about writing idiomatic python; it covers a lot of these things! [link](https://youtu.be/OSGv2VnC0go)
I am yet to try the module, but kudos to you for trying to do something from the scratch.

I personally use VS Code. Pycharm is good too but not free.

Nice...I always liked how my vivaldi did some pretty analytic with [browser history](https://help.vivaldi.com/article/history/)

Pycharm community is free. Apache license: it is allowed to uce in commercial
For me it depends on the application. On a raspberry pi, I need something very lightweight like Geany (little more than a text editor). When I'm doing data science work, I like Spyder or Rodeo. When I'm making GUIs or websites, I'll use VS Code or Atom (a nice compromise between being light-weight and having features like linting or auto-completion). I started out with Pycharm and moved away from it because it was slowed down by a bunch of features I never used.

I personally am fairly new as well and I am working on windows.. with that a use a mixture of GitHub and gitlab... And to make things simple I use GitHub Desktop. Along with .atom editor which has git tools built in to push commits, "changes" to git hub/ gitlab.. I use gut lab for personal private projects and GitHub for the public projects.
If he's a client of yours and he paid you to write this app, why would he need to reverse engineer it? He has it. It's his. I've read this entire thread and the whole thing seems odd. 
This one's good. No nonsense and it flows quickly. As a beginner that's a one of my favorites for quickly getting a refresher on a concept. 
You can get the basics pretty easily if you've already got experience with HTML and CSS. And if the OP has ever used Javascript, which modern day web developers can't really avoid, then Python will feel very natural. It's not hard to get to the point where YouTube videos are informational instead of confusing, and watching videos slightly above your skill level can give you great ideas about what you can do yourself as you get more familiar with programming concepts. I'd recommend Code Academy, Solo Learn, stuff like that, to start. When I want to learn a language I start there.
Yes, mutable default function arguments.
I prefer vscode There's pycharm as well, but I'm so sick of using intellij that I can't get myself to use pycharm ... Not a rational reason, but definitely a good preferential reason lol

That's generally a very bad idea and if it seems you need it, you probably need to structure your program differently. If you really need a answer (a bad one still!), sometimes a quick-and-dirty cache for a function is implemented as a keyword parameter with a dict instance as its default value. Not recommended, though. 
Something like... def foo(bar=0): ? If that's what you mean, then I use this pattern fairly regularly. Today I did one that looks through log files for entries that match a datetime range. In the definition I have a dither_factor, which is added to either side of the outage times to get entries before and after. It defaults to 60 seconds, but if I want to use a different value I can. A default, if you like. 
This one is good too. Sometimes he makes mistakes but if you read the comments in his videos they are usually corrected and you learn some stuff. This is true for most of the YT channels for learning python. I recommend watching multiple channels and reading the comments if that is how you are going to learn about programming concepts. 
Yes, OP is talking about default arguments, but using mutable data structures. For example, if a function expects a list and an empty list is used as the default. My understanding is that this is a bad practice as the default is only instantiated when the function is evaluated. So if the default argument is mutated by the function, the mutated list will be used with further function calls, which can lead to unexpected errors.
I'm teaching secondary school. I'm mostly looking for ideas or see if other teachers are here in r/python. I want to learn python for personal interest and kill two stones by cutting down on all the busy work I have, grading planning etc. 
I've made something similar with [wuy](https://github.com/manatlan/wuy). It doesn't let you embbed the chrome in a python app : but it let you re-use your current chrome installation to use it as a GUI (in "application mode"). BTW : I will try if I can plug cefpython into **wuy** : to make **wuy** not dependant of an installed chrome (it could be useful in some cases)

I have already installed every texlive package on my Arch Linux machine.
https://github.com/csvoss/onelinerizer /s
That's not a mutable default. def foo(cache=[]): ... That's a mutable default. It's initialized when the module in which the function is defined is first imported, and it never gets re-initialized, so any mutations to the default affect *all* future calls to the function. As for a useful trick with them, the only thing I've ever seen is a cache for memoizing the results of the function, sometimes useful in recursive functions.

Just something from on top of my head: def translate(s, words_lookup={}): result = [] for word in s: if word not in words_lookup: words_lookup[word] = very_slow_function_to_translate(word) result.append(words_lookup[word]) return ''.join(result) There are better and more clear ways to cache slow functions. But this example should work and it's somewhat useful. It keeps caching all calls to the slow function, but if caller already precalculated them and loaded from some other place - caller can use his own lookup dict instead.
Not really 100% an IDE, but I like Atom, since you can (relatively) easily write your own functionalities and there are loads of packages. But if you only program in python, PyCharm is probably a better choice.
When you open the developer tools in your browser, which fonts are being loaded? The console is also worth inspecting for errors. I actually only realised now that you're using Jupyterlab and not just the notebook. Are their font settings available for it?
Ow. I just noticed I should have post that on another sub reddit. this is my first post on reddit and I didn't noticed the rules. Sorry.
Piggybacking on this: Use. iteritems() instead of .items() when iterating over a dict. The latter creates a copy of the object you're iterating over, which can chew up memory for large objects. 
Read the sidebar.
Happy cake day!
I overlooked it yesterday but the console says that there's a CORS problem when trying to load the fonts: Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at about:blank. (Reason: CORS request not http). downloadable font: download failed (font-family: "MathJax_Blank" style:normal weight:400 stretch:100 src index:0): bad URI or cross-site access not allowed source: about:blank This is on Firefox, but with Google Chrome the fonts don't load as well.
Haha nice. I like that you did it even knowing that it's a terrible thing to do. R has the pipe operator from the Magritr package and it's a horrible hack that makes me long for python's object chaining.
The way the author used "|&gt; print()" construct makes me think that there's lack of understanding how this supposed to work.
I really like the pipe in R, and would kind of like to see the same thing in Python. I would settle for a slightly less ugly syntax for chaining multiple methods though.
Sorry about that...Hadn't seen it earlier
What makes you say that?
it's the same syntax as in [elixir](https://elixirschool.com/en/lessons/basics/pipe-operator/). what is the lack of understanding?
It's more useful in R where functions like filter() aren't methods of dataframes. But with pandas nearly everything you need is a dataframe method so chaining can be done with dot syntax.

I came up with this instead. class Pipe: def __init__(self, value): self._value = value @property def value(self): return self._value def __or__(self, fn): return Pipe(fn(self._value)) def double(x): return 2 * x def decr(x): return x - 1 result = (Pipe(12) | double | decr).value print(result) # This produces 23. It's less code, but it's still p scary. You have to wrap and unwrap your value, and it probably also requires functions you pass to be curried/partial.
Why is it a horrible hack?
Yup, I'd considered that approach too! But I wanted to keep the semantics from Elixir's operator (i.e. I wanted to avoid having to wrap the first value and partially apply functions).
Yeah I get it. The approach I followed here let me add on things ad nausea and I eventually I ended up writing a little library called [Slinkie](http://segfaultsourcery.com/post/slinkie). Slinkie has a .then() function that matches the pipe operator above, but do you think it'd be possible to elixirify everything else as well? I was inspired by LINQ when I wrote it, but I was never happy with how I had to wrap everything. The nicest thing would probably be to use extensions or traits, but this elixir trick would maybe do the trick as well. What do you think?
Hehe, that's cool. I don't know if I'll spam Reddit much more with this, though... doesn't seem polite. It's an early phase, but at this point I'm dogfooding it- it's sincerely less annoying that what I was using before. If I can get some traction and get some people to contribute that would be awesome, but if not, I'm scratching my itch. 
Method chaining is horrible for reading and parsing code as a human. Pipes make it easy to translate what’s going on into plain English. 
...what. Can you elaborate?
the thing is that python is not elixir and this "print()" will be a function call, it's extremely hard to introduce to python something like this, ```|&gt; print()``` instead of this ```|&gt; print ``` without breaking back compatibility 
Do you want to see the number 4 on the screen? If so, `print(2 * 2)` should do it. Also, /r/learnpython is a better place for beginner questions.
One way you could do it is rewrite the function's bytecode instead of its AST. Functions' bytecode should be available regardless of the environment.
I'm still not sure quite what you're getting at. The `print()` expression is rewritten to contain the left-hand side of the `|&gt;` operator before any of the code is executed.
but why it should be rewritten at all? I mean pipe is a syntax construct, we supposed to have an arbitrary function chained, this function does not to supposed to have any pipe-aware syntax in it's declaration. again, why not just |&gt; print There's (ha-ha, quite high) probability that it's actually me who just demonstrated lack of understanding, but this is still not clear to me. 
I just checked out Quart, interesting indeed. 
I should follow you on your repo but I'm on here way more often
We aren't doing your homework.
The exception you got is actually really interesting. It indeed stems from a fix put in place to disallow setting or deleting built-in type attributes via `object.__setattr__` or `object.__delattr__`. You can view the source of the fix [here](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Objects/typeobject.c#L5654-L5672). To make it easier to understand I've made a rough copy in Python: def hackcheck(self, func, what): cls = type(self) while cls and cls.__flags__ &amp; 1&lt;&lt;9: cls = cls.__base__ if cls and cls.__setattr__ is not func: raise TypeError(f"can't apply this {what} to {cls.__name__} object") return True The gist of it is that it checks if the underlying `__setattr__` function of the built-in class closest to the passed in object's class is the same as the underlying function of the `__setattr__` you call; if it isn't then that exception gets raised. What went wrong in your case wasn't that it was trying to modify `object`, it was because it was trying to modify the class. The `self` in your `make_setattr` doesn't actually refer to the instance, it refers to the class. The reason for that is on [line 64](https://github.com/zmitchell/annotation-abuse/blob/master/annotation_abuse/notify.py#L64), where you bind `new_setattr` to the class. Methods don't allow you to rebind them so the implicit `__get__` call when it gets accessed doesn't update it.
This reminds me of [function composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition), in the mathematical sense. Pretty neat in any case!
Awesome! I might start using that, I'm already a fan of partials, that looks like it would come in handy in quite a few cases, I had no idea it was already out there. Thanks!
I've been using the following pattern for static variables... is one considered better "form" than the other? def get_next_id(): get_next_id.last_id += 1 return get_next_id.last_id get_next_id.last_id = 0
I don't! and I particularly like your conjoin function, that's a clean way of solving the issue of executing (and aggregating the results of) multiple functions at the "same time", something I've encountered quite a few times without any elegant solution coming to mind.
I disagree. I think method chaining is amazing, unless we're talking about different things. I assume this is the topic: a.b().c() Not c(b(a)) Provided names are good, I strongly prefer the first option.
I’m using visual studio community. Got used to visual studio layout when I am coding C++ and C# plus, the GUI to view variables during debugging make your script easy to debug.
Thank you! I'm not entirely sure about the name, but it can be useful. Check out slinkie (another topic on the site) for my take on method chaining, if you want.
Here's another version I've seen, doing the exact same thing, only using the leftshift and rightshift operators (which are barely used in python). https://pypi.org/project/pipeop/ This has the advantage of being a pypi package and having better debug info since it edits in the stack. There actually appear to be quite a few libraries, but I haven't checked the code to see if they modify the AST. Using these ideas, I created an AST tail recursion implementation from another thing posted a while back: https://github.com/nayyarv/python-tailrec
Java requires an IDE to not be painful, indeed. For C just a text editor can do. Python is probably closer to C in this regard. An IDE can be handy later when you'll deal with big APIs like PyQt. If you have a text editor of choice already, try using it for Python. But bear in mind that Python has some quite strict code format conventions (indentation is important and read some about pep8). Most mainstream text editors shall be Python friendly.
call me lazy but was hoping to get some examples without having to read the entire book.
Yes exactly. R's pipe equivalent looks like this: a %&gt;% b %&gt;% c
You don't have to read the entire book, it is basically all examples so if you go skim table of contents it'll tell you exactly what you are asking for.
Some topics include web scraping, dealing with json data, dealing with csv, dealing with excel spreadsheets, pdfs, and more.
That is still harder to read than %&gt;%, because you can throw arguments into the methods which complicates it. If you're a comp sci background, the python/pandas way makes sense, but if you want to communicate in english what's going on %&gt;% makes it very clear. 
Why obfuscate *value*, and then use a property member function to access it as if you didn't?
It's not obfuscated, it's read-only.
Try pip install psycopg2-binary. Make sure you are using the wheel instead of the source. Check with pypi repo it seems that psycopg2 is supported with 3.7? https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2-binary/#files

Why would you use a string to access an instance method instead of `ClassName.method`? 
There is a "leak" in the last line. Ideally the variable should not be seen outside the function. Can probably be fixed using getattr. Purists may gag at both forms :D 
How is it a leak? This is where I learned of the pattern... [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/279561/what-is-the-python-equivalent-of-static-variables-inside-a-function](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/279561/what-is-the-python-equivalent-of-static-variables-inside-a-function)
&gt;`name, position = name_and_position.split()` &gt; &gt;`position = int(position)` Must have typed this a million times.
If you want data classes just use the attrs library
Why'd you delete it? HTML and CSS are just fine and make it a lot easier to learn other things like javascript or any other language.some people are just snobs about it.
Magrittr way is much more extensible. I'm not sure why you are calling it a horrible hack.
&gt;You’ll probably want to use sudo if you’re on Linux. Using pip under sudo is not recommended at all! [(Reasons)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21055859/what-are-the-risks-of-running-sudo-pip) I'd say that if someone is using python they should do: `pip3 install --user jupyter`
On the other hand, you can only access that variable by typing out the function's full name 🤔
Your version is definitely the better one. Having mutable default values is so unusual that /u/yesvee's version is really likely to confuse and surprise a lot of readers. Your version makes it really explicit that `last_id` is just a property of the function itself, and is hard to misunderstand. Having a variable 'leak' really isn't a thing. In any case, /u/yesvee's version has just as big a leak since anyone calling the function can reset last_id to whatever he wants to (`gen_next_id([5]`). At least in your version the caller is unlikely to do it accidentally, and if for some reason he legitimately wants to change the counter he can do it without side effects. Also, you avoid storing a list for what is in fact just an integer - so that's good too.

pipe syntax does not conform with standard evaluation. As you object, you would expect print() to be evaluated before any piping is done. If you look at magrittr piping in R, it does not use standard evaluation, which is sacrificed for (potentially) very readable code. However, the toolz.functoolz package provides some functions that allow for piping in a pythonic way. from toolz.functoolz import pipe, thread_first # piping without extra arguments. pipe( "hello", print ) # Piping with extra arguments thread_first( "hello", (print, "world") ) 
Does it have any positive performance differences? I believe there would be overhead because of the asynchronicity. 
There are examples[ here](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/) of how to monitor the keyboard, try running it and see what the output is when you press keys. 
Here's my implementation of the pipe operator: https://github.com/ForeverWintr/metafunctions I did it by replacing functions with class instances that implement '__or__' (and other binary operators). It's more code, but it works in the interpreter!
Don't you have to define `__format__` to use you object inside an f-string?

I mostly used these to cobble together a baseline app that worked for me and built on top of that. Good luck!
I'll take a look into argparse. Never heard of it. Thank you.
Thanks for your reply. What do you mean by:"don't wrap everything in a try block"? Do you mean that I can put everything in a try block but do exception handling properly, i.e. catch every possible exception? Or do several try structures?

The [Equal Earth map projection](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326879978_The_Equal_Earth_map_projection) is similar to the [Robinson projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_projection), except that it keeps areas constant, whereas the Robinson projection makes areas relatively larger when near the poles.

The equivalent expression with pipes is a |&gt; b |&gt; c This is vastly superior to method chaining, because method chaining requires each method return a specific type (one that defines the subsequent method), whereas that restriction doesn't exist with pipes. 
Better error handling and possibly a retry strategy depending on the response from the API. Tests...
Nice work! This looks awesome!
You just have to format your code nicely and then chains are easy to read
Even if I just started learning Python like 5 days ago ? (serious question)
&gt; there would be overhead because of the asynchronicity I've been wondering about this theory on my on for some time now, i.e. how much overhead the event loop has over straight function calls. gonna test it, brb
&gt; That's generally a very bad idea and if it seems you need it, you probably need to structure your program differently. For me that's less a case of "When can I use it?" and more "Why the fuck is that even a thing?"

R is a horrible hack :P
Pandas only works with panda dfs, not with regular python iterables.
Yes, if you aren't using pandas then the pipe operator might be useful.
Do separate try/except blocks around the bits that fail and deal with different exceptions differently, dont catch all Exceptions in one. For example perhaps on a connection error there could be a number of retries and then an error message. If google changes its API and you get an attribute error maybe you want that exception to bubble up or warn. 
In my experience I have a separate app launcher that doesn't call the `QApplication.exec_()`, so basically you don't have the event loop running. Then you can use the `QtTest` framework to send keystrokes or mouse-clicks. Dialogs are a bit of a pain, since they're modal, you generally have to queue up events with `QTimer`s and then call the dialog's `.exec_()` method.

Alright. I clearly made no sense to you, and you're making no sense to me, so maybe we're talking about unrelated things, here.

"If it doesn't exist yet, no one cared enough to make it before you. Be the change you want to see in the world" I feel like I'm quoting that from somewhere but I can't remember what. This happens quite often, just of course on varying topics. It is not reinventing the wheel if after some searching you can't find what you are looking for. However if it is just a matter of it being bugged, it may be better to contribute directly to an existing project.
I think the issue is because Guido tried to follow his principle of explicit is better than implicit. The asyncio explicitly lists the even loop, when in majority of cases you never need to know about it (I think the only use case is to make one thread schedule tasks in event loop of another thread). He also used async def / await to explicitly tell where async code is executed which is a blessing and a curse (especially when you want to write a library that is both sync and async and don't want to write the same code multiple times). Yes, asyncio is way harder to use than for example go routines, but go routines are limited to one specific pattern and they seem to be simpler because all the setup and use is hidden from the user. Similar thing happen with many popular async frameworks on python. The asyncio has grown on me and I myself don't really have complaints it works exactly as I want it to work, but maybe it is still as bad and I just got used to it?

Pylint will do this. In general, linting is a good idea; as is using an IDE with a built-in linter. 
Look into the read csv docs. https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html Parameter 'engine' might one of the things that could help you.

get faster storage or more RAM? If you read from the same file repeatedly, your OS will cache it in RAM. If you hit (20+) files in parallel, each of which is a few MB, your storage probably can't keep up unless you have an optane NVMe SSD. &amp;#x200B; Check CPU usage during reading. If all cores/virtual cores aren't maxed out, you are storage bottlenecked. If it is CPU bottlenecked, buy a threadripper or top-tier i9 CPU.
Given that this sounds like a problem relating to installing python, do you think that *maybe* it might be helpful to say what operating system you're using?
pylint shows this error along with a bunch of other errors I don't want. Is there a way to limit the results to unused imports only?
Check out r/learnpython
Lol I guess it might be. Using Windows 10.
Thanks!
Write better code and you'll get fewer of the other errors :P One possibility would be `grep`ing the output, but as it happens a google for `pylint show specific error` would lead you straight to [this SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43928076/2700168).
wow thanks for that..however, I'm looking for **undefined Imports**, rather than **unused imports**. don't see a pylint argument for that.
How far into [this tutorial](https://www.howtogeek.com/197947/how-to-install-python-on-windows/) can you get without something breaking? Ignore the section about python 2, you want python 3. The tl;dr version is 1. Download and run the "Windows x86-64 executable installer" from the [python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/) 2. Modify your PATH variable in Advanced System Settings -&gt; System Properties -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Environment Variables so that it includes the directory python was installed in, probably `C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36`
E0602 should be a fairly small superset of those cases, and all the other E0602s probably need fixing too. I'm intrigued by how someone has managed to write several hundred python files, all nonfunctional for such a basic reason.

I am certainly taking a closer look at this later. I didn't like that some of the questions were very difficult for me to understand what he wanted me to do. Like the "string rotation" question, a term which I had never encountered before. But anyway, I found [a problem](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/donnemartin/interactive-coding-challenges/blob/master/arrays_strings/str_diff/str_diff_solution.ipynb) in which the answer provided seems overengineered, and I wanted to know if my answer is wrong or if there's some benefit to his answer. The problem: **Find the single different char between two strings**. Here's my code, on a simple function, not a class, that gave the correct answers to his asserts (didn't run the unit test, only checked on my console): def find(str1, str2): if str1 is None or str2 is None: raise TypeError('either string cannot be none') for char in str1: if char not in str2: return char for char in str2: if char not in str1: return char find('abcd', 'abcde') # returns 'e' find('aaabbcdd', 'abdbacade') # returns 'e' --- The answer provided: def find_diff(self, str1, str2): if str1 is None or str2 is None: raise TypeError('str1 or str2 cannot be None') seen = {} for char in str1: if char in seen: seen[char] += 1 else: seen[char] = 1 for char in str2: try: seen[char] -= 1 except KeyError: return char if seen[char] &lt; 0: return char return None

In the README, they say “Challenges are provided in the form of IPython/Jupyter Notebooks and have been tested with Python 2.7 and Python 3.x” so you can write it in either. 
Nice article. What's the benefit of running dask on yarn over pyspark? 
Yep, these run on 2.7 or 3.x
They're different tools that overlap some in functionality. Each has their strengths and weaknesses. See http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/why.html for "why dask", and http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/spark.html for a comparison with spark.
I didn't examine the problem, but it looks like your solution assumes a single instance of the extra character. For example, find('abcde', 'abcdee') would return None, but find_diff('abcde', 'abcdee') would return 'e'.

I agree...also, without using a dictionary, you'd get a suboptimal time complexity of n^2 versus n: ``` for char in str1: # n if char not in str2: # n # n^2 complexity ```

When people say /r/learnpython they mean that it is a better subreddit for this kind of question. As someone who got this answer before, it seems off putting but the two subreddits have different purposes (search for the sidebar for each subreddit) and you’ll get better beginner answers there. The subreddit r/python is not the “google” for python questions. The stock answer is to learn both. I say python because it’s just easier to use to do simple stuff. It can probably lead as a gateway language. However, I’ve coded in both and I prefer python. In my job, the stuff I do is not “enterprise” level. With python, I’m getting stuff done quicker. Python is much easier to learn. 
A friend of mine and I worked on this some last night and came up with: (This solved the problem enough that I was able to import into Excel for further manipulation).... import pandas as pd from pandas import ExcelWriter from pandas import ExcelFile import numpy as np import os import io pd.set_option('display.width', 0) file = "results.xls" dfFile = pd.read_html(file, skiprows=1)[0] dfFile.drop([0], inplace=True) dfFile.columns = dfFile.iloc[0] dfFile.drop([1], inplace=True) print(dfFile)
I think I'm going to have to shelve prompt toolkit until they update their documentation: when I copy an example from their documentation and either get an assert error (py2) or import and module not found errors (py3), I can't use that code as a getting started guide.

What do you mean by think - input? 
&gt; Why bother with yarn? YARN is required for deploying on an existing Hadoop cluster. Besides that, I don't have a good reason. Dask supports many deployment options, but for a while didn't have a solid story for deploying on YARN. Now we do. I think you're conflating resource management at the cluster level (assigning resources from the cluster to a container, and assigning that container to dask), and resource management at the process level (as an application, dask will try to minimize memory usage, keep it below a set barrier, and spill to disk as necessary). &gt; This means that it has fewer features I wouldn't say fewer, just different. We have a lightweight core, and have built a large number of numeric abstractions (arrays, dataframes, custom computations, machine learning) on top of that. Much of this lives in the core "dask" library (`conda install dask` gives you all of it), some of it lives in other libraries in the numeric python ecosystem (for example, dask is a dependency of scikit-image, xarray, etc...). However, if you're referring to things like parquet, hdfs interop, etc... (things traditionally found in hadoop-ecosystem tools) then yes we're not as stable as Spark. This is largely a reflection of the larger Python ecosystem, as the libraries for working with these were/are primarily JVM based (and don't play as well with numeric python). This is changing though, with Pyarrow providing hdfs, and parquet functionality (there's also hdfs3 and fastparquet, but the pyarrow ones are likely to be more robust). Dask uses pyarrow internally, and with it has been used to solve real-world data-engineering-on-hadoop problems. --- Sorry for being nit-picky here, just trying to keep things as accurate as possible.

Working on a closed loop heater system for the South Pole Telescope. If the dish is the same temperature as the ambient air, frost forms on the mirror and disrupts the optics of the system. I’m writing a code that should run on a raspberry pi that measures the ambient temperature and the mirror temperature and heats the mirrors accordingly. Trouble in two parts: the heater can only be on or off and the wind direction really affects the rate of thermal energy lost. Anyways! That’s what I’m working on! Great idea OP, I like reading what everyone is up to.
https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-qt/ It is good, but never tried it beyond simple apps.

I don't really care about compilers for python; if I want compiled language speed, I'll use a compiled language. I've never used python for speed at runtime. I've always used python when I need to do data analysis or quick scripts that I'm only going to use myself. I've used Nuitka, and seen pretty decent results 2-4x on the stuff that I'm doing. I use it fairly regularly now because it is essentially free speed, but I would hardly notice the difference if I stopped.

I agree, I noticed both that and the inferior efficiency, but, to me, the wording, and the test cases, might have suggested that one simply had to find the single different character, and that it was unique, different from the rest. My solution passed the tests, is much simpler and clearer. Without checking for the answer, I would be oblivious to the more complete answer. My point is, in an interview setting, what would be sufficient? Could i ask for more tests, or a clearer question in one? Couldn't I use Counter in collections, instead of cointing it manually? Do they care about efficiency? I probably never will participate in one, so it's more of a curiosity. 
I got a starter kit with a bunch of electrical components for my Pi, so I made a game of Simon using some LEDs and buttons. It was super simple (&lt;100 lines of code), but fun to figure out the basics. 
I'm sorry but as I am on mobile I can't really understand the code. But there is something that I find very strange to me if you're a beginner : you're using "for event in pygame.event.get()" and then "pygame.key.get_pressed()". I think it is a bit useless, and not pythonic. Try using only ifs, like this : from pygame.locals import * ... for event in pygame.event.get: ...if event.type == QUIT: ......# quit ...if event.type == KEYDOWN and event.key = K_a ......# a is pressed

First, try storing you glob call and print its contents before even trying the loop.
I know that `--enable-optimizations` requires a bit of memory, but I don't see how it could need that much. It sounds like you could just write your instructions up as a script that could be run on a fresh AWS instance (possibly requiring running as root but who cares on a fresh instance). Maybe run that script and then post the script, description and output as a bug report to either the bugs.python.org?
I had to flip your division for the aspect ratio. `aspect_ratio = old_width/old_height` in order for it to work.
Working on an n-gram analysis script for marketing. The point is to get some neat insights on keywords used in longer phrases. Then probably a report automation web app.
Hm, I'd have expected it to work either way since I'm maintaining the ratio of height-width. I didn't think flipping the division would matter - but oh well. Also yeah from an exception handling perspective I'd have to ensure my denominator isn't zero, but for my denominator to become zero my image would have to have zero width which can't be the case in standard use, so I don't think I need to worry about that. :) I appreciate the feedback though, thank you! :)

I tried to pick something out of this world.
Please post questions like this in /r/learnpython. The error is telling you exactly what is wrong. You're using an index which is out of range, because the sequence you're indexing isn't long enough to have that index. There is only one place in the line throwing the error where you are indexing a sequence, so that must be the source of the problem: the list `outputStringArray` doesn't have an index `1`, so it must have fewer than two elements. Where does that list come from? You create it by splitting a string on newlines. If the result has only one element, then the string you are splitting doesn't contain any newlines. Where does that string come from? It's the result of a regex replacement. If the replacement succeeds, there should be at least one newline in the result. But there isn't, so the replacement isn't succeeding. So either there is a mistake in your regex, and it will never succeed, or the regex worked for your test data but you didn't realise that you have some input data that it doesn't work on. So add some failure handling, at least printing out the input and aborting if you don't get the expected number of elements in your list. An unrelated comment: please use the `with` keyword (context managers) instead of opening and closing files explicitly. Also, if you're going to compile a regex, compile it once outside the function instead of doing it whenever you call the function, which seems pointless (and I stand to be corrected, but I think that regexes are cached automatically, so there's no real performance benefit to compiling them explicitly). I would also eliminate this function entirely. Inside the function you define two constants, which it would make more sense to define outside the loop (or to inline as literal strings inside a `re.sub` call), which leaves only one line of actual varying code: so your function replaces one line by another line, effectively only obfuscating it.

Your list is never updated, so impossible for the algorithm to know what to do other than to show you what is always true 9 times. The loop while seems useless to me. This is what could work, while remaining simple and without changing everything. import sys #useless? import math #useless? x = [] #Ask 8 values for i in range(8): mountain_h = int(input()) # represents the height of one mountain. x.append(mountain_h) # I want to save the heights of the mountains into a list, to be able to use the max function to find the tallest one. #Treat the 8 values for i in range(8): y = max(x) # I want to use the list.index() function to find the index of the tallest mountain index = x.index(y) print(index) # I'm printing the index of the tallest mountain x[index] = 0

&gt; The point is, if I am replacing something from Python's built-ins, there is no reason to choose `libuv`, unless you are some kind of masochist. This library was written having in mind defective languages, like JavaScript or Python, where there's no parallelism, and they need some kind of replacement... but, if you are already going for a replacement, then why not do it right? Just use `pthreads` or write it in Rust, or whatever floats your boat. What? uvloop was written by the same team of core devs implementing asyncio. It is not in the standard library because of the requirement on libuv, but if you can use it, why not? It is far faster than the default event loop system. The event loop policy system was written to be "hot pluggable" for a reason. &gt; Yes, exactly, clowns. Why is this so strange? This is not the first stupid decision made by people who develop Python, and will not be the last. Calling the people who are writing your language clowns is silly. Where were you when this was being decided on? Didn't see you pipe up back then, and probably not in any meaningful way either. If you can do it so much better, write a patch. &gt; Yes, you "can" implement async iterator and corotutine in C. The problem is, they are worthless, because of what I described above. Except you didn't actually describe anything, just said "you can't/ its pointless anyway". Other people *have* written such libraries, there are plenty asgi libraries in Cython. &gt; The problem is that all of it is going to be managed by single-threaded Python's interpreter, which is pointless. You are still faced with the same choices you had in Python 2: either you comply with stupid interpreter, and run in single thread, or you release the lock, and then do what you want, just don't touch the Python's objects. But, with asyncio it's even worse because you have to relinquish the control of those object to the managing code. Asynchronous programming works on the idea of context switching, not on the idea of internal threads running in parallel. You are trying to use asyncio for something of which it is not meant for.

I made something like this a while back, but I never updated it to work in py3. [https://github.com/derricw/asciisciit](https://github.com/derricw/asciisciit)
Wow, this is cool! :D
You look great today.
Start your function with: if isinstance(IDN, int): IDN = [IDN] Then you can pass a single integer or a list of integers and the rest of the function should work the same.

Cool. But it would be cooler if you used Figlet for the logo. (What? Conflict of interest? Me???)
ik how to program, too big project, If i start doing it myself, It will be over 1 year of development by when it will mostly be useless. 
lol, no
I understand where you are coming from, I myself have rejected some free projects that offered the same, however, I am looking for a developer who would see eye to eye on this with me.
suggestion, instead of putting your doc strings above the function, put it as the first line inside of the function &amp;#x200B; this lets IDE's access the doc string, as well as python's builtin help and such &amp;#x200B; also, its convention to use """ for doc strings def resize(image, new_width=100): """ :param image: the image to resize :param new_width: the width to resize the image to while maintaining aspect ratio :return: the final resized image """ (old_width, old_height) = image.size aspect_ratio = old_height/old_width new_height = int(aspect_ratio * new_width) new_dim = (new_width, new_height) new_image = image.resize(new_dim) return new_image
Here's another note: You are only using the `i` name in your for loop for getting the corresponding position, so you could just `zip()` the two lists together instead. for idn, pos in zip(IDN, POS):
the first one I did was crypto prices too. 
Then you're going to need to share a bit more if you hope to pique their interest as the majority of what you've mentioned is going to push them away. You need a hook to sell them on.

Pretty cool. Thanks.
I'm working pyvter, an interactive statistics package which is a fork of pyvttbl, as it hasn't been updated in 5 years. I've already gotten in compatible with the latest numpy and now I'm getting to working with python 3, followed by swapping out its own dataframe class for pandas so that it can be used with modern tools.
You could scrape for: 1. sentiment data. 2. web stores for inventory and pricing information. 3. News/media coverage and the correlation of them to other things/the effects thereof. IMO there’s lots of interesting things you could do with just those few. Maybe if you’re having trouble finding inspiration for a hypothesis, it would be advantageous to collect a bunch of data and then see if what you find inspires something?

I tried the second fix but unfortunately it didn't help. Both Firefox as well as Chrome still showed CORS errors.
Not necessarily an answer, but a design suggestion. As a user of your method, it would make sense to me if I could pass you a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the motor ID and the desired position. For example: ​ commands = \[ (2, 10) # Move motor two to position 10 \] ​ move\_motor(commands) ​ This feels clean to me as a user, and would also allow you to simplify your logic a bit ​ for motor, position in IDN: \# operate on the motor and position here. No need to to worry about deciding whether you have a list or int, \# or using enumerate

If you can isolate your files with a 'glob' pattern do 'import glob' and then 'glob.glob(directory/your glob pattern)' and you will get the proper files. If there is a more more complex regular expression you need then use os.listdir and isolate the files based on yoru regexp 
I don't know if there is a way to select files in a file manager window, but if you can create a list of the filenames you need to copy, you can the module shutil to copy files. Something like... import shutil list_of_filenames = ['this_file.png', 'and_this_file.jpg', 'dont_forget_this_one.tif'] for filename in filenames: shutil.copy(filename, 'directory_to_copy_to') 
Yeah that was working at one point, but like I said I never updated it to work with python3 or opencv3.x so I can't guarantee that it will be easy to get running again. I'll try and put some more time into it over the next couple weeks maybe if I get a chance.
Brewery taps. I’m making an api to host local breweries tap list. 
My go-to tool in this case is `strace`. When you see this kind of behavior, attach to the process and see what system calls it makes. You could also attach to Python process with GDB. It takes some getting used to, but, essentially, you can extract all the necessary runtime information about Python process using GDB (especially, since you have the sources already).
&gt; which can't be the case in standard use, so I don't think I need to worry about that. Famous last words, everybody.
Could be cool to add a simple config file for things like output file name, whitespace character, default output location, etc.

I love this project but my major issue with it is the file size (like 15mb last I remember). Honestly, all we need is something the can run the bytecode and then just pass that to the browser. You'd have a tiny file and still have Python in the browser. Do we really need an interpreter and compilers and not just a runtime? I do think the existence of this is awesome though, but I don't think it's the way to go to bring Python to the browser. 
Haha this made me lol

I don't like this so much only because in the instance I want to bring motors 1-18 to zero, I can just say move_motor(range(0,18), 0). Maybe there is an obvious simple way to generate [(1,0),(2,0),(3,0)...(18,0)] in a one liner but I'm not familiar with it.
This is so useful! I'll definitely use this here and can already think of like 10 other instances where I'm using enumerate the same way.

Nice, I've done this in the past as well, and if you're willing to take a suggestion from my experience you get better results if you squish the image by 1/2 vertically in the processing (due to the fact that characters are about half as wide as they are tall). &amp;#x200B; To show you what I mean I made a small edit and generated the octocat image with the height halved and the original so you could see a comparison: [https://imgur.com/a/Y72E3Ze](https://imgur.com/a/Y72E3Ze) As the images scale up in size the difference gets even more noticable. &amp;#x200B; (For reference, here's my repo [https://github.com/buckley-w-david/py-image-ascii](https://github.com/buckley-w-david/py-image-ascii), I never got around to finishing it)

I've just been doing cities so far and midwestern/mountain cities like Omaha, Denver, Salt Lake, KC, and Milwaukee tend to be much more male-dominated.

Games are usually not written in pure python because of several reasons like its speed for example. The most game ish thing for python would be pygame. If you really want to make games learn some c++ or c# and use one of the big engines like unreal or unity.
Depends on what you want? You want a 2D game engine, 3D game engine, or just a graphics engine in general?
2D game engine, but graphics engine in general really.

I use Pygame for all my games. Pygame is really easy to use and can do almost anything you want. They updated it a couple days ago also so.
This is cool, but what about excel integration? That’s what people want.
1) what is power bi 2) how much longer until Excel uses python? (I know it's in the works but I'm impatient)
what if you just reverse the whole script?
Pyception 
1) basically a fancy way to display dashboards of various sources, mainly SQL databases. A gross simplification, but still. 2) hahahahahahaha
Great! Now all that's missing is to drop VBA for Python!

I have written a concave hull algorithm in Python. It is based on this one: [http://www.rotefabrik.free.fr/concave_hull/](http://www.rotefabrik.free.fr/concave_hull/) It uses matplotlib to triangulate the provided points and removes the boundary edges longer than your provided length. That is the way I prefer it rather than an *"Alpha"* value or a *"Shrink Factor"*. It can easily be changed. Anyway I have quickly published a [Python Concave Hull Gist](https://gist.github.com/AndreLester/589ea1eddd3a28d00f3d7e47bd9f28fb). I have not polished it for public consumption. If you need assistance on how to use it just let me know. It is fast and I have used it for as many as 100K points. You will need matplotlib and shapely. Good luck.
I’m taking a class at college, and I’ve taken Multivariable Calculus that had a small component on ODE and also vector calculus. The LA/ODE Class doesn’t involve a computational component. I was thinking that performing operations with code and documenting it in a Jupyter Notebook would be a good way to take succinct notes and help reinforce concepts. So that’s why I was looking for any resources specific to computational LA/ODE and in python specifically. 
What are you trying to do? Delauney triangulation is very easy to do in python and might be what you really want.
Have you looked on the internet yet?!
That's odd, they got rid of all the download numbers on PyPi at years ago because they're inaccurate and heavily influenced by automated build systems and mirrors. It's probably 95% automated builds for most of the popular packages. Regardless, sweet! I'm at 10,136!

When you just triangulate a number of points the boundary edges represents the convex hull. By systematically removing the boundary edges beginning with the longest edge until you meet the given criteria you arrive at a concave hull. See my algorithm elsewhere in the comments.
Why not [this](https://pypi.org/project/libtiff/)? PyPI has a search box.
Because VBA.
Ability to use one of the most commonly used programming languages in the most commonly used spreadsheet application.... awesome potential! 
Only with R at the moment, check out [this article](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/interactive-r-custom-visuals-support-is-here/). It's nice to have the zoom and the tooltips, particularly when you have lots of data to show, though it can be a little slow for the visualisations to show up.
Imo if you need to do anything more complex with data than simple Excel macros you should be using standalone python scripts / SQL if situation allows. Can't really think of why you'd want to add the complexity of python to a spreadsheet app. Although I wouldn't recommend using VBA either. 
Yes, I meant .bashrc and no, that's not the issue, just a typo. Thanks though.
This is nothing to do with python. Try searching on "macos dock icon blurred".
Calculate the alpha shape/concave hull!
How can a standalone python script replace an excel sheet? How would you define a simple Excel macro? Idk what industry you work in and how tech savvy your upper management is but, in a lot of companies I have worked at Excel is it. Be it a receivables report, a valuation model, or a build sheet everything is done in excel. I have used openpyxl, and pandas to manipulate excel files in the past but built in python in excel would be god send. In my experience, you can run queries in SQL and get the data but the final deliverable/KPI is going to be in excel. You cannot assume your client will have all the tools you have at your disposal. Its a risky maneuver that will delay payments by "3-5 business days". 
I doubt anyone at MS wants to dig into the 20 year old spaghetti that is excel in order to add support for anything.
In combination with this answer have a look at poetry on github. The README guides you through starting a package building it and uploading to pypi 
Last year someone paid me to scrape titles and abstracts for academic journals from publishers' websites. Recently I put something together to download PDFs of journal articles from Sci-Hub using a list of DOIs as a favor for a friend. I scraped some Turkish forums once to make a corpus that I could use as a resource while learning Turkish. 
I think it may already have become as big, or even bigger, in marketing. If you do a lot with crawling, monitoring - python has way less complicated dependencies than R (e.g. Java/rJava) and it just beats SPSS on the whole concept of gow you deal with data, data structures and streaming data to your evaluation model.
Python 2.7 is still being maintained by the Python organisation. Python 2 isn't getting any new features, but a significant proportion (around [25%](https://www.jetbrains.com/research/python-developers-survey-2017/#python-3-adoption)) of Python developers still use Python 2. It would make sense that Microsoft supports it. Also you're misleading people because you're leaving out the part where it says you can "change which installation to run". This almost certainly means that they support Python 3 as well.

Not sure if it's close to what you want to do but: You could look at the domain and try to guess if it's misspelled. For that, get a list of popular domains (gmail.com, etc.) And use Fuzzy Wuzzy to see if you find a closely matching popular domain from your input. Example: gnail.com -&gt; gmail.com

that's google sheets
Python 2 EOL is January 1, 2020.
Ad text mostly. Anything containing sentences will be up for this (google ads search term too, but theres already a specific script for that). For our purposes - video titles. 
&gt; nobody should be adding Py2 to anything new these days. For a community project I would agree, but this is a business we're talking about. Microsoft not supporting Python 2 means less business. However much they spent on adding Python 2, they'll make much more by having supported it.
No one cares. Delete this. 
That only means that the author is running 2.7. I'm on 3.6.6 and it works perfectly with Power BI
&gt; Excel is it And the reason for their using Excel isn't always because that is all they have available, many times it is because it is what they prefer. I've worked in investment banking, and our power users, mainly traders, continually build out custom dashboards with dynamic and live data from several different sources in Excel, it is fascinating to see. Our traders pushed Excel 2016 so much, that they literally broke it, and no amount of Microsoft help could fix it. So Microsoft sent out an engineer from the Excel product group who I worked with onsite for a week to gather data on our usage, which lead to several patches being published. Long story short, millions and millions of Excel power users have spent years customizing and refining their workflows through Excel using countless external tools and resources. Simply migrating all of that to another platform isn't easy, and in some cases isn't even possible. Microsoft is fully aware of this, which is why they are still pushing Excel functionality forward even while they make similar breakthroughs with Power BI.

I know what you're saying (I think). People often write unnecessarily complex Excel spreadsheets or batch files, etc, when a Python script probably would have been easier and more flexible (assuming you're comfortable writing a presumably non-trivial Python script). There's another dimension to this, though. There are countless spreadsheets that *should* be spreadsheets. But one column, or even cell, has some complex calculation or formatting. VBA can be really nasty. Python integration would solve this nicely without having to learn SQL and how to replicate the immense number of things that are easy or kinda easy in Excel (friendly data entry and viewing, plotting, pivot tables, ...). Plus, as popular, and powerful, as Python is, Excel is almost universally used. Lots of people just aren't able or willing to to learn Python. And even of they are, their bosses will almost always veto the inevitable X weeks of learning and debugging as well as training for anyone else that needs to understand the code.
thanks. actually ran into another issue just now. ill see if they can help! &amp;#x200B; appreciate it! &amp;#x200B;
What’s funny about 2?
Hey np! Some APIs provide that feature, like Google Maps but others don'e like Foursquare. If Whimso got popular enough I'd extend my layer I built on top of them with additional functionality like open or closed, ratings, featured user pictures etc but it's not popular enough yet ;) What kind of projects are you working on? DM me if you want any help/advice.
Thank you very much. The process seems a bit complicated, but designing my own visuals is pretty valuable. I'll have to sit down and study that tutorial. :-) Here's an R plotly example for those also curious: https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals/blob/master/RVisualTutorial/CreateRHTML.md Hopefully this new Python function would let us do something like [recreating all these scikit-learn examples into drag+drop widgets](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/index.html).

Hi, I think there could definitely be more information on this, I would like it myself. Having said that, there are a few options. I would go with CFFI, since it has the best compatibility and performance with PyPy, while obviously still working with CPython. Other options: "Traditional" C extensions - compatibility with Pypy is getting better, but since you can access any part of the C interpreter, it's can easily break. Ctypes (the predecessor to CFFI). Cython (not as good compatibility with Pypy, but interesting).
Yesterday I learnt how to use flask, and brushed up on my html skills. Today I've learnt how to webscrape (I haven't figured out how to filter out everything yet) and will continue once my source is whitelisted on the server I'm running on. I've also learnt how to email this data to myself (once it's completed.) 
They've had an official poll or consultation or something about it a while back. MS is not fucking about when it comes to opensource, what with WSL and Python on Azure. Excel will have Python support soon enough, watch this space
Shhhhhh! Let's imagine those are pythons
The more code you write the easier it is to read. Start *writing* code.

And he's wrong too because those are King Cobras which, funnily enough, aren't actually cobras. They get the name because they kill and eat cobras
Excel may be the most used piece of software in the Office suite. I can't even count how many companies use Excel on a daily basis for some form of data processing. Including a language that's more accessible and open source should provide way more extensibility when compared with propriety VBA. &amp;#x200B;
There is pickle to dump/load your objects, but it's nothing like real-time (as you need to load/dump), it is used to store your object into a database (redis, sql...) or a queue for instance. https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/pickle.html
G.I. JOOOOOOOOOOOEEEEEEEE!
oh boy.
Masonite is a pretty interesting framework. The creator (/u/Jmancuso9) basically went and created a framework **heavily** inspired by Laravel. IIRC the aim is to create a framework that comes with "batteries included" (including an authentication system) but isn't very opinionated like Django is. So basically, if you hate Django because you're always fighting with it (I know I am) but love the built-in stuff like the authentication system, Masonite might just be up your alley.
Either they are redeeming past sins or they are still doing what they ever did. I really reall hope it‘s number one.
That can’t work, information is lost in the conversion
Sometimes, various devices has a mac addr too(i hear various sounddevices etc). Is it possible to ensure one only gets the mac from the device used to connect to the internet? &amp;#x200B; Also this uses ifconfig? I thought that was being phased out, for example on my archlinux box i don't have ifconfig.
THANK YOU! how did you know it was just hex?

Hi, could you elaborate a bit on the "always fighting with Django" bit? What are the examples of your objectives and Django's way of making it hard for you to achieve them?
Noted sir . Thank you ! 😍
The logic checks out 
Uh, this isn't an encoding, the method just prints the value of each byte as a string in hexadecimal notation. Cryptographic keys aren't human readable strings, so your bytes object isn't encoded, it's just the key in its raw form. If you want to manually inspect single bytes, you can use hexadecimal or binary notation or whatever suits your needs. If you want to store bytes as string and don't care about the content, you use a compact representation like base64.

No, you are wrong and could have fact checked yourself with a quick Google, like I did. https://pogirigowrishankar.wordpress.com/2012/11/08/king-cobras-common-cobras-we-beg-to-differ/
No, let's not. 
&gt; Python 2 EOL is January 1, 2020 We know. The business world moves slowly. If you don't want to use python 2, don't use it.
Huh? That's just an identification guide to tell what is what, nothing about categorisation. Cobras belong to the *Naja* genus. King Cobras are a genus in their own right. https://www.quora.com/Why-are-king-cobras-not-part-of-the-Naja-family-not-considered-a-true-cobra &gt; Its scientific nomenclature is Ophiophagus hannah. **Although it is named the king cobra, but in reality it doesn't belong to the genus of the true cobras** i.e the Najas and is moreover the single and sole member of its genus.It is because of this reason that **this snake belongs to the monotypic genus of Ophiophagus**. One of the reasons why **they aren`t considered as true cobra** lies in their external morphology which is **clearly distinct from those of the true cobras**. Good day
It's polymorphism in this instance of the class.
Those are king cobras mofo

I think we are all missing the point here which is that this is horrifying
Isn't this a trademark infringement? At a minimum you'd owe royalties. https://www.python.org/community/logos/ https://www.python.org/psf/trademarks/: &gt; ##Uses that Always Require Approval &gt; Any commercial use of the PSF trademarks in product or company names must be approved first by the PSF. &gt; ... &gt; Commercial sales where a substantial element of what is being sold is the Python name or logo are subject to a royalty. Examples of this use include clothing items, cups, bags, stickers, or other small purchasable items that prominently feature the Python name or logo. 
That is pretty interesting but I think you are mixing up parity with parody.
TIL
That are learning how to python
Thank you!
Pickle is very different, though: end users aren't expected to create pickle files to represent objects! 
Wrote a guide that explains how to [update values in MySQL using Python](https://datatofish.com/update-mysql-python/).
&gt;\*New Reddit doesn't let me indent like old-Reddit did; and I'm too lazy too switch to old-Reddit to make this look right. You just need to click the link that says `Switch to markdown` and then use \`\`\` markdown syntax on a separate line around your code like this: class python_class: def snake1(): print("I'm a snake learning how to Python!") def snake2(): print("I too, am a snake that's learning how to Python.") Then click on `Switch to Fancy Pants Editor` to get back to the WYSIWYG editor.
I'm going to assume Py3 and won't test on Py2 because it's not easily accessible to me right now. Are `Thing` objects meant to be unique upon construction? You're appending `sp_child.quantity` Things to your result individually, constructing a new one each time, and there's a small amount of overhead in the append call because of it. You can use list addition on a generator expression instead if the Thing objects are uniquely constructed. for ci in parent_truck_items: for qty in range(ci.quantity): sp = ci.product if sp.is_bundle: sp_children = list(sp.children.all()) for sp_child in sp_children: result += (Thing(truck=ci.truck, product=sp_child.child) for _ in range(sp_child.quantity)) else: result.append(Thing(truck=ci.truck, product=ci.product)) Now, also for sp_child in sp_children: for qty in range(sp_child.quantity): result.append(Thing(truck=ci.truck, product=sp_child.child)) Is a product-like for loop. If the range was not dependent on the child, `itertools.product` would be a good choice. But it isn't, so `itertools` won't work here. You can, however, use a nested generator comprehension: for ci in parent_truck_items: for qty in range(ci.quantity): sp = ci.product if sp.is_bundle: sp_children = list(sp.children.all()) result += (Thing(truck=ci.truck, product=sp_child.child) for _ in range(sp_child.quantity) for sp_child in sp_children) else: result.append(Thing(truck=ci.truck, product=ci.product)) Furthermore, if `sp.children.all()` returns an iterator, which it seems to do, calling `list` on it is a waste, because this causes the iterator to expunge all elements to be placed in a list, which is a waste of time, processing power, and memory. If it does not return an iterator, then it must return an iterable, on which you can use `iter` on to get the internal iterator. for ci in parent_truck_items: for qty in range(ci.quantity): sp = ci.product if sp.is_bundle: result += (Thing(truck=ci.truck, product=sp_child.child) for _ in range(sp_child.quantity) for sp_child in sp.children.all()) else: result.append(Thing(truck=ci.truck, product=ci.product)) Also setting and then loading `sp` is a bit of a waste, because you set once, load and get an attribute twice, any gain is negligible-- for ci in parent_truck_items: for qty in range(ci.quantity): if ci.product.is_bundle: result += (Thing(truck=ci.truck, product=sp_child.child) for _ in range(sp_child.quantity) for sp_child in ci.product.children.all()) else: result.append(Thing(truck=ci.truck, product=ci.product)) If you want an (extremely minor) performance improvement, you can replace the append call with list and tuple addition: for ci in parent_truck_items: for qty in range(ci.quantity): if ci.product.is_bundle: result += (Thing(truck=ci.truck, product=sp_child.child) for _ in range(sp_child.quantity) for sp_child in ci.product.children.all()) else: result += (Thing(truck=ci.truck, product=ci.product),)
Agreed . Totally forgot about that sub. 
yeah but Python is a completely new feature in this product. It's not like people are magically able to copypasta whatever Python 2 code they wrote and slam it into their pbix file and have it work. Why not make it better and have them port that code to Py3 while they are integrating it into their pbix.
I hade to replace aspect_ratio = old_height/old_width by if old_height &gt;= old_width: aspect_ratio = old_height/old_width else: aspect_ratio = old_width/old_height For it to work on my landscape image. And I made you a new logo https://dropmefiles.com/8PIHU

These approaches are obsolete now with WebAssembly. If you want full Python running in the browser a better approach would be to compile CPython or pypy for wasm, with a very small javascript layer to do the loading and provide the &lt;script type="text/python3"&gt; tag.
This seems like the best answer. Also it drives home how "concave hull" isn't well defined and there are multiple answers, unlike convex hulls. Also I've tried a bunch of implementations of convex hulls in python, and by far the most robust and fastest implementation of ND convex hulls are the qhull ones [included in scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.19.0/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.ConvexHull.html).

Thank you for the information, kind sir!
They're all ducks right up the point where `constrict()` throws an attribute error.
This is not intended to be marketing. 
They are clearly trying to learn everything they can about pythons to survive when a python attacks. Many constrictors hunt venomous species, so I see the logic. Smart students if you ask me.
So it’s a Corba class then? Greeeat...
&gt; scelesto what is that? I'm interested. 
You can't just force a joke.
That's the best Quora post I've ever seen. I usually get upset when I land on their stupid site and it refuses to show me the answers. 
python, cobra, w/e, they still probably write better, more efficient code than I do.
I use, and contribute to pyglet. It's a framework, not a full engine, but is more than capable of 2D and simple 3D games (Minecraft style). There are high level APIs, but you also have direct access to OpenGL if you need it. 
I've only been installing through PIP. The .bashrc was fixed a while ago. It keeps saying things like /home/&lt;oldname&gt;/anaconda3/bin/&lt;whatever&gt; doesn't exist, which is odd because I'm uninstalling and moving the anaconda3 directory. An online search has a lot of people say "Don't move Anaconda- it's a nightmare", but I can't for the life of me figure out why an uninstall/reinstall isn't working. Lastly, to the anaconda team, I'd like to recommend ~/anaconda3 paths if it's in the home directory structure!

Can Numba use multiple GPUs, natively? That's a non-trivial programming task. Probably you'll need to use MPI? Or some other multi-processing tool to split up the job? https://github.com/numba/numba/blob/master/examples/cuda_mpi.py &gt; 2. If multiple GPUs are available to a single MPI process, additional code may need adding to ensure the correct GPU is used by each process - this will depend on the exact configuration of the MPI cluster. Tends to suggest Numba can only run one GPU per Python process to me. Also: https://github.com/numba/numba/blob/master/examples/cuda_dask.py

Nope, I'd done this in 3.6. Have you got the required modules set up? You'll need PIL to execute this code. You may want to verify that you've got that dependency already present, and if you don't, install it with pip. :)
Nice! Now I need to find a way to make that automatic across all systems and platforms! :-)
What have you tried so far?
Yeah, turns out my env was running py2, thought my env had Pillow but a different one had PIL, hence the confusion. My question was backwards without me knowing it.
Ok will check it out. 
first of all, /r/learnpython second - why do you have messy lists withh everything and the kitchen sink in it in the first place? Lists are intended for homogenous data. 
OK“ just some online tutorials“ is not specific that doesn’t tell me which online tutorials you tried which will give me a better idea of what to recommend what might work otherwise I might recommend exact same thing you’ve taken. For someone who wants to get into code you don’t think very much like a programmer. Code is a very literal or specific vocation and it’s going to piss people off if you continue to ask vague open ended questions like this.
Glad to know it all worked out! :)
Basic inventory program.. If anyone can help, I have a post about it in here. &amp;#x200B; [https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/99phhj/simple\_inventory\_program/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/99phhj/simple_inventory_program/)

You need to create an array containing what colors to call each cluster. Something like this: cluster_colors = np.array(['green', 'blue', 'orange', 'grey']) colors = cluster_colors[y_kmeans_PCA] Then when plotting: ax.scatter(X_Demo_fit_pca[:,0],X_Demo_fit_pca[:,1],X_Demo_fit_pca[:,2], color=colors, edgecolor='k', s=40, alpha = 0.5)
Thanks for the reply. I'm fairly sure Numba can handle multiple GPUs, because I found this: [https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/cuda/device-management.html](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/cuda/device-management.html) \&gt; For multi-GPU machines, users may want to select which GPU to use. By default the CUDA driver selects the fastest GPU as the device 0, which is the default device used by Numba. \&gt; The features introduced on this page are generally not of interest unless working with systems hosting/offering more than one CUDA-capable GPU. The above is where I learned to use the cuda.select\_device() features, etc. However, when implemented as I have above, it throws no errors but also doesn't select the GPUs as I expected.
I got the greenlight to "recreate" the structure in the old home directory. I copied my anaconda directory (about 15GB) to a newly created /home/&lt;oldname&gt;, and it works now. I think about half the files run from the old and half from the new. I'm half tempted to try your method anyway, but Tensorflow-gpu was a nightmare to set up and I don't want to disturb the balance. Thanks for your suggestion - it would have saved me time.
You mentioned using pip for installing. Give conda a shot if you haven't, there are conda recipes that have made installing gpu versions of torch and tensorflow a breeze.

Thanks a lot. The problem with color is solved. This is what I got but still I couldn't relate the colors with the Centroids. Is it okay? After doing the PCA, I really couldn't relate the scaled data with the actual data. Can you please guide me a bit with that? &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
See my interpretation of that is that often you have a workstation with a display card, like a 1050, and a workhorse GPU, like a 1080, and you want to pick the 1080 for processing. Based on what Stanley Seibert said you need to do all the memory transfer operations first, and then start your kernels. And you probably would need to use the `DeviceContextManager`: http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/cuda-reference/host.html#numba.cuda.cudadrv.devices._DeviceContextManager So have a loop that does all your `.to_device` calls first, and then another loop that calls `kernel_function`, and then a final third loop to synchronize. Then you're explicitly separating loading data onto the GPUs, starting them, and then retrieving the results via `.synchronize`. It's probably still faster to use some multi-processing tool, like `concurrent.futures`, because of the blocking calls to transfer to GPU memory. Then again maybe not as you might just saturate the PCIe bus. 
&gt;Switch to a Calendar based versioning scheme. Genuinely curious, why is this good? I've found it to be confusing. Sure, I can immediately tell how long it's been since a project has updated (I can imagine this as useful, but have never found it so) but can't tell how significant the changes are (vastly useful when maintaining a code base).
It is the highest voted feature request for Excel https://excel.uservoice.com/forums/304921-excel-for-windows-desktop-application/suggestions/10549005-python-as-an-excel-scripting-language
if you're looking to get this done i'd keep it as simple as possible while you're learning. I'd go with 2 built in libraries Tkinter for your interface(not necessary if you want a CLI) and sqlite for your database. I'd further suggest finding tutorials on getting started with either of these on youtube. Sentdex (my favorite python tutorial maker) has several series on tkinter. i'd suggest starting with his beginner one [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ccct5D2AyNM&amp;list=PLXiIqbagGqNLtqJ-rsQJ_qk7qKOH1N3my). 
What other tools should I pick up? Thanks.
That's a good suggestion thank you
The built-in function `type` will tell you what the type of a value is. You can compare it against `str` or `int` or whatever else you're trying to check. &gt;&gt;&gt; items = [3, 'hello'] &gt;&gt;&gt; type(items[0]) == int True &gt;&gt;&gt; type(items[1]) == str True
/r/learnpython Also, it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission (EAFP). Try to square it and ignore failures. def square_if_possible(possible_number): try: return possible_number ** 2 except TypeError: return 0 answer = sum(square_if_possible(item) for item in messy_list) Note that you can't always take this strategy - for example, strings can be added and multiplied.
&gt; why do you have messy lists with everything and the kitchen sink in them in the first place Might be read from a file or something, with comments or headers in it.
That looks like Cobra Commander.

You can imagine this question being asked quite often. Read this subreddit's sidebar -- it'll get you on your way toward the information you seek. Then check out r/learnpython and read their sidebar -- it has a lot more of the information you seek. Read their wiki, as well. The information is out there.

If you want 'really simple', I think Excel can do all of this for you. (Python would be more 'fun' though.) My suggestion would be to fully (or nearly so) implement it in Excel before implementing it in a database. &amp;#x200B; [Data Entry Form Example](https://www.myexcelonline.com/blog/create-data-entry-form-excel/) &amp;#x200B;
I find that Django is often too opinionated, and the components are integrated really tightly. Which is great if you want to do things The Django Way, but sucks if you don't. If my objective is to use the email address instead of username to log in, I shouldn't have to reimplement or extend several core auth-related classes to get it done. If my objective is to generate thumbnails from an ImageField (something Django can't do for some reason) and also store them as ImageFields (the logical thing to do), I shouldn't be forced to reimplement the model's save method to set them. To me, any framework that bills itself as a general one but where I have to modify or override core code to get things to work is badly designed. Frameworks should get out of your way, which is why I prefer to use Pyramid these days as I find I'm more productive in it. In fact, the only thing of Django I miss when using another frameworks is the authentication system, which is one of the reasons why Masonite looks so appealing to me.
That would be a rape joke, no?
Using this right now and got my first pip installable ! Thanks a ton.

Hi Python community, we wrote a post how to DIY code your own ETF. This shows you how ETF works and how you could even come up with something better. We also attached the complete notebook in GitHub for you to start your research easily in python to science the ETF world. We appreciate any comments and feedback how we could code our own automated passive investing ourselves!!

yeah having some weird issues syncing cards that i've downloaded but one's I find through the website or app search are working fine. probably a problem on their side. Thanks for all the resources you've provided!
haha oh shit you're right
How about doing the clean up using a list comprehension? clean_list = [x for x in original_list if type(x) in (int, float)] &amp;#x200B;
I use app.py, just the way the guy I first learned from named his main file - don't think there is a 'right way' to do it. And your link that says remove .py? I didn't see him say that, all he said that I found was that a dash will only work for a script because you can't use import with a file that has a dash.
Personally I use `base.py` but that's for my parent class for the module and I don't generally import it in the `__init__.py`
Yes,I do
Without the register() call? Interesting, I thought automatic detection was just for the ABCs in `collections.abc`. Register, then, is either still there only for backwards compatibility, or it's there for cases where the auto-detection doesn't work (for example, for a class that doesn't define `do_foo` but uses `__getattr__` to act like it does).
You think python classes are great - next door they're teaching pandas! 
The default interface detection logic is currently pretty rudimentary, and only looks for what is typically the default network interface (`eth0` on POSIX, `Ethernet 1` on Windows). However, if those interfaces don't exist, you won't get anything, and it won't detect if they're not the default route. However, this is an area I'm currently working on improving. In a later release, it will determine your default network interface, then look for the MAC of that interface. Yes, it attempts to use `ifconfig`, in addition to a variety of other methods, depending on what you're looking for. For instance, in current release on POSIX, it tries 11 different methods, including the `fcntl` syscall, `/sys/class/net/`, `netstat`, and `ip`.
Just think of this, but as a question

Not sure if you got a notification or will see my comment below, but StackExchange (parent company of StackOverflow) has [Code Review](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/) 
&gt; Just think of this, but as a question Super... Just think of this, but as an answer
Indeed! 
Dude if you don't want to help me, don't. You have better things to do
__TL;DR__: please ask specific questions, or at least be more specific with what don't know. This makes it easier to help you. Your question is really vague. Before asking questions, it's generally better to break a question like this into smaller questions. Your question as it stands is not an easily answer, since you basically just ended a list of requirements with a question mark. Also, you have not provided any real context. Saying "my app needs to access another app for the user while staying in the app" doesn't really say what you need help with. Does the other app expose an API? If your app is doing things on behalf of the user, how are you authenticating (assuming user-specific data)? These are the kind of things you should try to figure out before asking what you should do, or even ask how to find these things out. Providing context a) is helpful for anyone trying to help you, since most people on the internet aren't mind readers. b) it is a matter of respect. If you expect strangers on the internet to take the time to __help you__, the least you can do is make their job easier. 
Your question was incomplete, so he was trying to figure out what you needed help with. You never said what you are having problems with, have tried, or if you don't know where to start. If you can provide more details, you'll have much better results with finding help on forums like Reddit and Stack Overflow.
No worries. What attracted me in the first place was how easy it was to get something up and running. I can't really take any credit since I had nothing to do with poetry myself just a user. 
xinabox.. what a great design! how to waste 3 gpio for controlling an rgb led that cannot turn on more than one led at time -_- just to save two smd resistor? wtf
Yes! would be very interested in something like this on Reddit. Great way to learn

Code👏review👏.
Ultra fast fortran binary file parsing using numpy. Obviously, it's ancient and legacy on legacy. For example, there's a float value called theta that is an angle. Seem simple enough, except that that value can also be an integer. To support that, they decided that a reasonable value to write was `theta = 512.0 * (coordinate_system_id + 1)` if it should be an integer. There's no flag; you just have to know (based on the value). Gets screwy because in the goal of optimization and getting away from 0.0, people add 360 degrees to angles.
Yup. 
Yes. It could even be done by reviewing code for Python open-source projects.
This account posts several links about programming per day for some months but they are exclusively only from medium. That last part raising my suspicions further. Have decided to block the account.
I would install them using homebrew: https://brew.sh Install it and then run `brew install python3` and look for the name of the pyqt package with `brew search pyqt`, then install it. I don't know if PyCharm bundles its own Python, but if does, you might need to configure it to use homebrew's Python.
I tried that but I get a command tools error. 
Without the actual error it's hard to help. Basically you need to install python, qt itself, the pyqt wrapper and run the code on the python version in which you installed the wrapper. Something on the lines of: ` brew install python3 qt pip3 install pyqt5 ` To test you can run `python3` on the Terminal and `import PyQt5`. If that works on the Terminal but not on PyCharm than it's a PyCharm configuration problem. If it doesn't work on the Terminal than your homebrew setup is probably not complete.
Jesus christ do you not get tired of spamming your videos everywhere across reddit ?
do we need permission from somebody to do this?
Within PyCharm, open your interpreter settings and install PyQt5 and pyqt5-tools. The designer will be installed in the **site-packages** folder, together with all other python packages. If you have issues, sometimes you have to install PyQt5-sip (normally it is a requirement and it happens automatically, but it may fail on some systems). 
Meh, if it's helpful OC, I don't mind. He/she should probably stick to posting it to 1-2 subreddits however.
First 3 chapters are for beginners. 
I've been wanting to do one for recipes for a program I'm working on. 
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) bundles python libs (a lot of them, including pyqt5) and qtdesigner. &amp;#x200B; You can install it on Mac. To keep using PyCharm, just point PCharm's python interpreter to the Anaconda's interpreter.
Yea! I have a pretty niche package I built for work. I've shared it with my professional community (Librarians) and have gotten some feedback. I'd appreciate getting some more!
You can download Qt designer from the Qt website when you download Qt. To install Python bindings, the Qt foundation distribute PySide2 `pip install PySide2` PySide2 is the official alternative to PyQt5. If you want PyQt5 however, check out Anaconda which is a packaged distribution of python with a slightly optimized interpreter and comes with common packages life PyQt5.
IMHO the most important thing is to use entry points. If you don't use entry points, at least don't put "top-level" scripts in the actual package directory. Put them outside and import the package.
So if you do df.columns (where df is your pivot table) it should list the column names. If you then do df.sort\_values(x) where x is one of these it won't work?
Unfortunately, what you're trying to do won't work. Virtualenvs aren't really about packaging / distribution, they're about isolation. They allow you to write python apps and test them in a controlled environment which isn't affected by whatever python packages your operating system needs. A virtualenvs is isolated from your computer's system python installation, but not actually separated from it. It depends on your computer's system python install in order to work. I'm guessing the errors you're receiving are due to the fact that your customers computer doesn't have the exact same python installation you do. If you want to make your python app work on other computers, you have 2 options: [packaging](https://packaging.python.org) Or [freezing](https://docs.python-guide.org/shipping/freezing/) Packaging is easier to do than freezing, but the downside is that the package you make can only be installed on computers which already have the right version of python and a package manager like pip installed. Freezing is more complicated and difficult to do, but a frozen python app can be distributed to and run on any computer that has the right operating system, even if that computer doesn't have python installed. 
You don't. You create an environment and install necessary dependencies on the sever your script is running. Check out r/learnpython for python-related questions and how-tos.

Why don't we make it a weekly chime call? I can host it as I have a license for the meeting. &amp;#x200B; It would easy to structure. We have plenty of python savvy people on the call, one problem at a time consists of: One subject Two reviewers Every problem that comes up, two savvy folk would volunteer as reviewers, and a subject would as well. I know it may be difficult to review a 500 line example that a subject presents, so maybe we can write a sweet and nifty flask application to handle the assignment of subjects/reviewers beforehand? Just thinking outloud.
Lists and tuples have identical element access time. Their __getitem__ methods are virtually (if not exactly) identical for single items and the only difference in their structure is the memory address of the first element. For tuples it follows immediately after its size (as an array, PyObject *ob_item[1]), with extra items being hidden "under" the tuple while for a list the address is arbitrary pointer to a single dynamically allocated memory block (PyObject **ob_item). I mean I guess it's possible that dereferencing the list pointers are theoretically worse for the cpu cache, but in practice, even on the C level with hundreds of billions of accesses you will struggle to see more than a 2% difference.
pyqt5-tools isn’t installing but PyQt5 and PyQt5-sip did. I wrote import PyQt5 on the console and it still says module not found. 
Do you have some level of unit testing, a requirements.txt file, flake8 and pylint, + travis / gitlab ci? If not, then your code sucks. If you have those things, you code will definitely suck less, because it's hard to write sucky code that has those things. If you're going to do a 'review my code' type of thing, you should make some of the aforementioned items mandatory, otherwise you're going to get 99% suck code.
You can name the files main.py, but it's bad form to ask people to cd into specific directories to execute code. You should consider providing a setup.py + entry points: https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2014/09/15/python-apps-the-right-way-entry_points-and-scripts/ Note, you don't have to name the file __main__.py as in the example, it can be named anything you wish.
* CodeReview is quite barren as far as Python code (which isn't leetcode) is concerned. Even for stuff which isn't leetcode I couldn't find anything over a 100 LoC. * It doesn't have any code review interface, it would be a pain to just write comments without referencing line numbers. (Same goes for doing it on reddit)
I agree that some set of common/easy pre-requisites would need to be imposed.
Also, even though Stack Exchange Network is amazing and incredibly useful, it does have limitations when it comes to in depth discussions. That's something Reddit is much better at.

Github is probably the best place for code reviews. It supports all this. 
&gt;This guy says remove .py from scripts One of the other commenters clarified that it was the dash not the filetype suffix that was changed. &gt;But I name the ALL my scripts in each directory as [main.py](https://main.py). Is this okay? Yes, the title of the folder describes the operation of [main.py](https://main.py). Also, I assumed that if I called other scripts from the folder, since they are in a varied directory call, they can be renamed during import to the directory name in the \_\_init\_\_.py file rather than leaving it as main. &amp;#x200B;
For some GUI stuff, you will have to download the whole Xcode app (found in the App Store). Once its installed, run it once and the application should prompt you to download some various extra libraries. Download those and you should be able to install these various things using `brew`.

I'm working on an very basic image editing program like MSPaint.
Demo here: https://iodide.io/pyodide-demo/python.html The major downside seems to be that you have to download all of the compiled Python packages every time you run the page.
I'm trying to come up with a medium-scope project idea, but am failing miserably to get started. I often find myself wanting to make something useful, but dismissing it because it's not useful enough or because it wouldn't really be a challenge. And on the other end of the spectrum, I find myself only coming up with ideas for things that wouldn't really be for any purpose other than to do it. Like, creating an evolution simulator or recreating a board game, and so forth. One of my favorite projects I've made was a semi-functional Gameboy emulator, because it had a "real" application. But I lost interest in making it fully-functioning because it was slow and buggy and was mostly just to see if I could do it. What I need is a project idea that has a real use.
For the love of God, don't do this to your son's teachers. 
What kind of pivot table is it? Do you have multi index? What do you mean by sort? Sort data? Sort columns? Sort rows?
hey mate, did you find the solution to your issue? I'm having the same thing with my path leading to 2.7 instead of 3.7 and I still couldn't manage to solve it.
Check if gunicorn is in your requirements.txt
Sorry to chime in, but I have the same issue: &gt; echo $PYTHONPATH :/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages I'm having this Issue: &gt; SystemExit: Your PYTHONPATH points to a site-packages dir for Python 2.x but you are running Python 3.x! PYTHONPATH is currently: ":/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages" You should `unset PYTHONPATH` to fix this. When I type "unset PYTHONPATH" I can run on 3.7, but when I close my bash I need to unset it again.
Couldn't agree more haha teachers have enough to deal with. If you can't take the time to type up the emails each time you want an update the don't bother them. 
Hope you don't mind I'm taking this issue from here because I have the same one :p $PATH &gt; $PATH -bash: /Users/matiasmintz/.pyenv/shims:/Users/matiasmintz/.pyenv/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Users/matiasmintz/pygobstones/path: No such file or directory
The monitoring system we use at work doesn't provide notifications... So I'm working on a program that pulls in data and alerts when it detects a new alert, initial testing is looking good, code is a little clunky but I'm happy with how it's coming along
The teachers have all signed off on a weekly email, it's part of the 504 plan. I'm just trying to automate it from my end.
I like to combine both: REPL if I need to try stuff out, and then writing actual unit tests once I understand what I'm doing. The problem with REPL only is that it's easy to get lazy and not put the tests in. You lead to the problem the author has where they have to put tests in after the fact, which is not great.
I would be careful with allowing users to upload their own files for profile images. Unless you are careful at data cleaning, a malicious user could insert code into what appears to be an image file that will run upon open. 
None of those things evaluates the quality of modelling, which is the part most likely to suck in code. I doubt what he wants is a code review where all people tell him is "Two empy lines after imports".
You should be able to get around that with local storage and versioning e.g. downloading first time and on upgrades
There is nothing wrong with that per-se. But there are a number of edge cases you may need to worry about: 1. What happens if the image is accessed between saving the large one and saving the small one? 2. What happens when an error happens between saving the large one and saving the small one. You will be left with the large one on disk. 3. Do you care about performance? You shouldn't, until you have to. But you will be doing more IO than strictly necessary. This is a place to optimize later if necessary 
I was hoping for actual problem solving.
You got any advice for on the plan I've laid out or the stack I've described? Or did you just want to second guess the plan that his teachers and I have come up with?
I have a project that I would like people to look at mostly I want to make sure that the instructions on using it are clear. https://github.com/siecje/nginx-auth-proxy 
Is this gig still available?
Probably there's a config file somewhere on your system that is setting `PYTHONPATH`. Find it and remove the relevant line. Perhaps it's in your `.bashrc`?
&gt; .bashrc This is the only line on my .bashrc export PYTHONPATH=:/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:/opt/local should I delete it or just reroute it?

Very nice!
Easier to set up? Or easier to use?
So I downloaded Anaconda3. How do I access the qt designer?
n o, wh y_
If it's still there then it's being set somewhere else too. `grep -R PYTHONPATH ~` if you have to.
I'm using nearly the identical code and process for uploading images that you are showing. The thumbnails are 800x600 in my use case and I'm also keeping the original files. I'm mainly dealing with larger photos. The environment is an internal web site and the performance is fine. Since you are not keeping the original file and it is open to the public, I would recommend that make sure your process is contained. I would have the uploaded file to a tempfile (or io.Bytes) and then do open/thumbnail and save that to the final location (website/profile_pics). This makes it easier to contain the uploading of files separate from the files used on the website. The other two comments at this time are good as well. 
Well reasoned and planned models lend themselves to easier testing than those without. And, if you want people to review your code for algorithm suitability, it's nice to have code that is clean and readable.

Flask can handle thousand of users when ran thru uswgi. 
I really can’t find something reliable. How do I get the qt designer if I have Anaconda3? I heard it’s bundled in with PyQt5? If so, should I separately install PyQt5 &gt; Set my Pycharm interpreter to Conda &gt; then get the designer?

Welcome to the world of highly dynamic code.
in particular, I think apis (you mentioned Django) are really well suited to test-in-order-to-develop development. there's a super clear input output where you can do full integrated tests that literally hit the api rather than unit testing functions. theoretically you could run such tests written in go or python and run them against either implementation, if you wanted.
I"m sorry for the snarky response; I'm a teacher on the verge of returning to school for the new year and this just pressed all my buttons. If it is a legitimate part of the arranged 504 then it's great; good luck with the year and I hope your son thrives. I can vouch for Flask on something like this. It is very easy to get going if you haven't got any experience with it. I have also had (relatively) inexperienced students build their database driven web sites using Django. The setup is a little more intimidating I think, but once everything is in place you automatically get an administrative interface that plays nicely with your database. The only reason \*I\* never use Django is because I started out with Flask. If you're comfy with administrating a MySQL database then I think that's a great option. You could also do very well with SQLite, I think. Some day you may think to yourself: "what if I configure my router to expose my nifty server to the Internet? I could access it from anywhere!" If that happens then try to resist the urge because you will suddenly have to devote time and energy to hardening the thing and keeping out the riffraff.
There is a lot more context that anyone would need to give you a full answer. But you might want to look into jinja templating in python 
 &lt;HTML&gt; I am text. Lah-di-dah-di-doh! &lt;/HTML&gt;
I tried but not effective with output text . My code more than 100 line and 10 loop at least 
Thanks , I wanna search it. 
Could you show us an example input and output? That might help a bit more. You may not need to use jinja
Along with Automate the boring stuff. Learn Python the Hard Way by Zed Shaw is a good read. I used it as daily exercises to help cover some of the basics up to more advanced.
My output: Users 1- example 1 2- example 2 Bots 1 - bot 1 2 - bot 2 Users with administrators: User1 - user2 - user3 Server name : example Server id : example Memers : 193836 ...etc
I also would need to see the input. You say you have 100 lines and 10 loops so I thought you wanted to write python code to an html file. As I see it, this is the output in the console and you would like it to be in an html file. The easiest way to do this would be to replace all your print statements with a statement appending to a string and then wrap the string in html tags where you finally save as a .html file. I think that may work for you. The other person’s comment provides a bit of an example.

Location: Global I work as a salesman who sells everything anyone else has for sale. I need someone who can take an API from a distributor comparing website, use their info to make a search query of different distributors, stock levels and prices. Then link the distributor names to customized user emails. Wich will then automatically send them requests of quotes on their products.
Easier to setup, no running daemons, just a single portable file that can be queried.
I think you need to learn what HTML is.
Yes that is what i am thinking about it now . Every output in loop or others I wanna add html code inside it . I know that’s hard work . Now I saved it in txt file . But poorly organized 
It's the Bitmex market maker sample program pal, looking to build an aggregate ticker across multiple exchanges. It's a simple python project but already has some of the stuff I want, once completed I would be looking to write custom trading logic but I'm just looking to get the data into the program as of now.
The gmail stuff is fairly easy. Look into the library "smtplib".
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42090739/pyqt5-how-to-start-the-designer
Taking a cursory look I wouldn't see why it isn't feasible, besides the fact that you'd need to implement this to run on their own threads.
Thanks for taking a look pal, was trying to accomplish something similar using node but was getting a large amount of exceptions thrown which was killing my event loop. Hoping to have more success with python. Cheers
It sounds like this would just be easier to do by just using gmail funcionality. You have a thread per teacher, you will have the historic overview like that as well. You can find all threads by searching for the shared topic "How is ... doing" or whatever you want to add to the subject that you can use to find. Maybe the school's domain or something. Then you just set a reminder in your calendar that repeats weekly.
How close is this to really being viable to use Python as your main front end scripting? Not for production, but just to mess around.
Yes, that sounds interesting please.
Quite a simple bash alternative. Not so cute, as your script anyway =) function vl(){ SEC=$(find . -name "*mp4" | xargs -I {} sh -c 'ffprobe -v error -show_entries format=duration -of default=noprint_wrappers=1:nokey=1 "{}"' | awk '{ sum += $1; } END { print sum; }' "$@" ); printf "Total Time of course is : %s\n" $(convertsecs $SEC) } cd videodir &amp;&amp; vl
If you want concurrent processing, node is way better to use than python. It's literally built to handle multiple incoming connections at once. You can handle multiple in python but you'll need to learn the multiprocessing file to create several processes.
Can't you just filter the announce list?
The "major short coming", regarding print statement, feels like a properly working feature.
It looks like this is [no longer supported](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html?highlight=iteritems) in Python 3.
How big is the telescope? 
It has a 10 meter primary mirror. All about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pole_Telescope) 
Well I figured it out! It turns out I could replace this code: frames = [] data_stream = stream.read(CHUNK) frames.append(data_stream) wav = wave.open(OUT_FILE, 'wb') wav.setnchannels(CHANNELS) wav.setsampwidth(p.get_sample_size(FORMAT)) wav.setframerate(RATE) wav.writeframes(b''.join(frames)) wav.close() rate, data = wavfile.read(OUT_FILE) with this code: data = np.fromstring(stream.read(CHUNK), dtype=np.int16) , therefore making my code a lot more efficient, and also making it just a little bit easier to read. And then I could use the rate returned from [wavfile.read](https://wavfile.read) and replace that with RATE in any code that requires it.

Django and Flask are both great options for what you want to do. Django is great if you are starting from scratch and need a lot of built-ins like a nice admin interface, managing migrations of your DB, etc.. Flask, in my opinion, is faster when you need to use already existing databases, simple projects (like single pages with just one form, etc).
Javascript might be peaking. Its not hard to see somebody like Continuum or hosting basic runtimes with common packages, people will cache those, then devs will hug those...
Cool - thanks :)
Do you mind giving more details? Results from my google search tell me the manifest file only deals with the offline look and some meta data related to disguising the web app as a native app. But nothing is related to local storage or any offline storage/caching.
Thank you again guys! 😁
What do you mean? Are you having speed issues generating the pyc files?
What types of computation does your script do?
It's already solved. I just had to delete the git repository and create it again. Thank you for the feedback.
It runs several ML algorithms.
I think most of them are for Windows. 
Not at all, from what I've seen. I've wished so long to have first-class Python in the browser for web app development that can produce development and output parity to JavaScript. Maybe this will get us closer.
Isn't the GIL still a thing?
It depends mostly on how often users will interact (per second) with app and how much compute will every interaction require. In hard case all users will interact heavily, say 1 action every second, and all at once. It means 30-50 req/s. So your update cycle needs to be no more than 20-30ms to be served by 1 core server. In reality load will be at least 2-5 times less, because internal apps are not super engaging and you’ll have 2-4 cores server. So just make sure to have everything computed in under a half a second and you’ll be fine. Just don’t forget to use something like gunicorn with gevent (and multiple workers) to profit from multicore setup.
I've been hoping WebAssembly could make this possible. I'd like to do some browser stuff but I just don't like JS.
Uh no that's clearly a bunch of NOPE. 
Try `open -a Designer-qt5` or `open -a Designer`
This is a very likely explanation. Thank you.

I do use Anaconda distribution. I found this link which illustrates your point: [http://sharapov.com/2016/02/08/building-numpy-with-mkl/](http://sharapov.com/2016/02/08/building-numpy-with-mkl/)
&gt; I'm just trying to automate it I think this is the part where you are going to lose any real benefit. I mean you are looking to automate this because it's tedious. I get that... But it's tedious primarily because of the burden of composing the *content* of the e-mail from your end NOT because the logistics of actually sending an e-mail (or doing anything else on your list) are tedious [1]. So if you are just going to automate your end of the interaction why not just have each teacher agree to e-mail you weekly in the 504 without the autonag from your end? [1] Fore example... Set a recurring weekly calendar event. Highlight all of last weeks e-mails in the sent folder of a real e-mail client like thunderbird and press ctrl-e, done.... Need to see all of the previous e-mails neatly laid out, press the threaded button, etc. etc. Why write some rube-goldberg local web-app that basically recreates a shitty yet highly-specialized e-mail client in a web browser? Again, the actual logistics of creating a set of e-mails every week are trivial (i.e. one keyboard shortcut) with a real e-mail client, and you can't ever automate the hard part (i.e. thinking of something actually meaningful to write to each teacher in each message).
The type coercion is pretty annoying for one. Really a big thing is that the language tries to make it easier to use by just trying to fix anything you do wrong. But that does the opposite, and makes it harder to pin down what the issue is. In Python you'll get an exception immediately. I read a highly recommend book on JS, and it constantly said stuff to the effect of "Everyone says X feature is a weakness of JS, but it's really fine when you use it this way." Like being good requires knowing how to work around the weird stuff. Thankfully that has gotten better in the last few versions.
Yeah, pretty much. I've been messing with Django recently and the server side is super enjoyable. Then the front end is...eh. Python has spoiled me on pretty much everything as well. I started programming in Java, tried Python, and now I'm having a really hard time getting into anything else.

Yeah, I agree. My friend does mostly C and he keeps saying that Python looks gross to him because there are too many words. I personally think it's great that you can almost verbatim copy+paste pseudo code from Wikipedia.
pyqt5-tools isn't compatible with 3.7 yet if you are using Python 3.7... (like everything else understandably) 
Hello! I'm a bot! It looks to me like your post might be better suited for r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. That said, I am a bot and it is hard to tell. I highly recommend posting your question there. Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster. Show /r/learnpython the code you have tried and describe where you are stuck. **[Be sure to format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F)** and include which version of python and what OS you are using. *** ^(this bot is written and managed by /u/IAmKindOfCreative) ^(This bot is currently under development and experiencing changes to improve its usefulness)
Ah yeah forgot about that - in python 3, .items() no longer creates a copy of the object (operates exactly like .iteritems() in python 2 does). 
Too many words what does that even mean? People coming from languages with curly brace delimited blocks and semi-colon terminated statements have a natural reversion-- I know I did-- but I got over it and know its better for having them.
&gt; If a 16 core Xeon processor has a Geekbench score of 5000 for single core, and a dual core i5 CPU also has a score of 5000 for single core, will the compilation time be the same? Yes it will. A assume you mean interpreter runtime instead of compilation time. There's all sort of tools to overcome Python's single-threaded limits: 1. C-extensions running MPI. 2. Cython running MPI. 3. C-extensions with custom implementations of threadpools. 4. C-extensions that release the GIL and can be serialized with tools like `concurrent.futures.ThreadPool`. 5. Multiprocessing tools like `dask` and `concurrent.futures.ProcessPool`. Each has its own place. The breaking of Moore's Law due to Joule heating has been perhaps a bad thing for computing in general, but financially a very good things for programmers who understand how to leverage multiple cores and can make bank for it. 
Yup, it does. 
Pretty much that, he says it doesn't look like real code.
For whatever it's worth, I'm currently building a Dash-backed internal site for our company that should have a viewer base of 50 in-house people at a minimum. We're putting it behind gunicorn with a few workers to distribute the load a bit, and I've got a decent degree of confidence that it will support the demand without too much stress. &amp;#x200B; The Enterprise deployment they sell is mostly designed for true large-scale installs, to give you full support throughout installation and ongoing maintenance -- same code, but with support. With the free version you're on your own (plus the docs and community board, which actually has a pretty useful and lively discussion).
&gt; In Python you'll get an exception immediately. Well the only reason that this isn’t true in JS is because of its async-first paradigm. JS has a fundamentally different goal because of the fact that it was originally just for the browser. As for your 2nd paragraph, I get the sentiment, however I think that a lot of this perceived weirdness comes from the fact that people learn typical object orient programming and then try to learn JS later. JS just has a fundamentally different paradigm from your average OOP language. Similar complaints could probably be made about going to functional programming languages some of which are objectively better than Python many ways.
Sure, but there's a reason OOP languages almost always have some of the same baseline features. And there are several things such as generators and default parameters that I would really miss from Python if there weren't added in ES5/6.
I did a lot of C, a long time ago, and I wouldn't go back for hardly anything. I did some recently and it just wasn't fun. His loss really. :)
Made my own website ([https://lafleche.io](https://lafleche.io)) in few nights with Django and just finished to write my first [article](https://lafleche.io/articles/etoile-args-kwargs/) ! It's written in french, so not everybody can understand it, but I would appreciate comments ! &amp;#x200B; Thx :)
Because this approach is going to be really slow, eat up your disk space, and limit your scalability. In many cases though, those are all just theoretical problems and this is fine. But personally, I would direct upload to S3 and use one of the million image resizing services with the resultant URL. See https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/s3-upload-python and let’s say https://www.imgix.com/ for the resizing. 
Mezzanine is a Django based Wordpress alternative. Are you also looking for hosting? 
Hosting, url registration - the works.
Hmm, not very user friendly. Like how do I apply my own algorithm/thinking to this? Also given the hft guys in the space I can't imagine using an sqlite query to identify arbitrage opportunities is going to work super well. Also I don't know if this not takes into account commissions which are also a cause of naive arbitrage opportunities.
I know about DT, it's the basic for concavehull although it's not straightforward to shrink the boundary. Thanks for the xyproblem link. I wonder why you know about this problem!
Hey. Thanks for looking into the code. This is mostly for learning purposes and yes it does take commissions into account. For you to find arbitrage opportunities you would need to go through many different pairs and this is why SQLite is used. It stores all the opportunities that occurred (in case of using bot crawler script) so you would be able to go over them after scanning and make a rational decision on what pairs to use. After doing that you could use bot speculator script to execute on orders and write a history in another table. Again, it’s mainly for educational purposes and not intended to be used as is.
It's important to know many languages in this world. Javascript and SQL are two of the major necessities I think. MySQL is probably a good one to start with. It probably wouldn't hurt to get versed in another database server or two though. It really depends on where you're going with it.

Weather scraping app is one idea. Can scrape data, get a readout/consolidate data somehow, then send yourself a text with the data. Could expand it to include calendar things for the day or friends birthday, etc. Another is build an application that can diagnose your PC (this is something I thought of when working at a help desk position). Create an executable that can determine last time machine was restarted, maybe read recent logs, other troubleshooting as well. Can google swarm behavior or Conway’s Game of Life and see if you can make a simulator. Best idea is to find something you want to do, whether it’s scraping analytics for a game you play, watering the flowers automatically, or a tracker to see how long it takes you to finish a book from start to end; a project you want to do will be more exciting and rewarding than anything we could think up for you
Please, provide more descriptive information. What error do you see?
Indeed! Just found out about that problem! I couldn't look into it, but is surprising [the time is taking to have a new release](https://github.com/altendky/pyqt5-tools/issues/13).
