great idea i'll take it. On my way to the patent office. Thanky you very much. I will write your name in my upcoming "How to become a Milionaire the easiest way" biography down.
Haha, I copied the idea from my friend doing it in IRC. My irc bot can do this as well, except they have to be smaller because there's a 512 byte limit per line and all the colours take up a lot of characters. 
I used ANSI colour codes 0-256. It simply matches the image pixel to the closest colour code. You have to match it to the palette used by most terminals. 
Awesome, looking into this now, thanks!

Either convert the file to a CSV and look into the [CSV](https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html) module, or install one of the few Python extensions for Excel

About 0.7 including floating point precision errors.
Making a server-less api which interfaces with a library which does aircraft noise calculations, all made with aws and python. Anyone here has any tips about how to streamline the aws workflow? I feel like I'm working in the aws dashboard too much compared to my normal developing workflow. Im using lambda, dynamo, gateway, s3 and cognito. I originally used zappa to deploy a flask api which does the task okayish, but the overall size of the lambda function got too big due to libraries needed. But I liked the development experience better because local testing/version control was more like what I'm used to.
This is great ! Good job man ! I always felt myhe images would pop up on my terminal everytime I preprocess my data before training it. But if course it’s not possible . But I would love to use this script sometime !

Yeah, but like, did you type it out once you got the response back or generate it programmatically from jQuery/js and paste it in?
Have you seen VLC's ascii mode? It renders video in text, although I'm not sure it does colour.
I used jQuery to generate the python code string. I used element inspector to add an id to the table and then did var out=''; $('#tbl').find('td').each(function (){var t=$(this);out+=t.text().trim()+':'+t.css('background-color').substring()+',';}); console.log(out); I then just cleaned out some of the bad bits and it was fine. 
I don't see the conflict. `?` already exists as a token and isn't touched by this proposal. 
Yeah I've seen it. The difference with mine is that it does 2 pixels per character. Using the half block unicode you can set the foreground and background from 2 pixels.

Oh, that's my misunderstanding than!
I really don't know if this PEP is actually seriously being considered for Python 3.8, though it's admittedly hard to tell w/o being aware of the context. Basically, this PEP (and several variations) was first created sometime in 2016 where it went through a lot of discussion with no clear resolution -- the PEP was deferred indefinitely. Since then, people have brought it up on the python-ideas mailing list a few times -- most recently last month. The latest wave of discussion/debate seems to have died down though/hasn't really made it to the python-dev mailing list (python-ideas is just for speculation; python-dev is for ideas that are more likely to be accepted). A little more broadly, the Python core devs also haven't decided on a new governance model yet -- I believe the first wave of proposals is due sometime this upcoming November or December, and will be stablized sometime in January of the upcoming year (see [link](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/2018-July/005935.html) and [link](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2018-July/154723.html)). This means that barring some exceptional circumstance, no PEP will be accepted or considered until Jan 2019 at the earliest. Python 3.8 will enter the feature-freeze stage around the end of [May of 2019](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0569/), which gives people roughly about a 4 month window to petition for the PEP + get it accepted + implement it. I mean, it *could* happen, but it seems pretty unlikely to me -- PEP 505 is pretty controversial, and 4 months isn't a lot of time.

Pandas has read_excel() and to_excel(), extremely simple use case for this.
You’re already part of the community! It’s not about stepping up your knowledge, it’s just about keeping on working on stuff you find fun, and before you know it oh god I’ve been coding for 5ish years and I still make rookie mistakes. Personally, I just kept experimenting, adding new things, getting frustrated and looking up issues. Ain’t no shame in looking at how other people code – I used PIL to manipulate images for my cross-stitch-ifier, but it was mostly reading the docs, checking stackoverflow, and using a little cunning when the two didn’t agree. Great artists steal, after all :) A good kind of project to do if you have no idea where to start is something simple, automatable, and not too complex. If you make sure you decompose the problem into functions, boom, you can now steal them from your past self later on. For example, here’s a few off the top of my head you could try out: * Given a colour `(r, g, b)` and a dictionary of `{name: (r, g, b)}`, return the name of the closest colour. * Given a list like [[1, 2000], [33, 4]], output a table where columns are the right width with a separator, like: ` 1 2000 3 3 4` Have fun!
&gt;See now the problem here could be in hashing, collision and probing of python dictionary. Nope. That's not it. Get that notion out of your head, it's wrong, assuming you are truthful that the j indices are ints. Regardless of size, the hashing/collision/probing will be amortized constant (assuming the key sizes are bounded). Are you sure this problem fits in RAM, and that this isn't just a swapping issue? The slowdown behavior you describe still sounds like an O(N\*\*2) issue, the kind that would happen if you are (accidentally) searching the lists (with the 'in' operator), invoking repeated linear search inside a loop. Is the code you posted a complete and accurate representation of the loops you have? It appears d2 is fully constructed before entering the loops you posted, and isn't being modified? Be sure the slowdown isn't in the creation of d2. Just profile the code already. This is a wild goose chase without more hard data. &gt;Now if that is of any help, do you know of any way to improve this? I gave you suggestions for improvement, without any feedback. I cannot give you any more in the blind. There are a ton of ways to figure out where the slowdown is; you have to remove (or comment) portions of the code inside the loops, isolating with parts are the slow parts. Ie. temporarily remove the app query to see if that removes the slowdown, remove the sort, etc. Or just profile it.
Thank you. Do you know if it will let me write over an existing column?
Without a code example it's impossible to know what you're doing wrong. Most likely you have some bug where you are iterating over objects more than once, or constantly resizing immutable objects like strings or tuples. &gt;Does anyone know why the compiled statement took longer to run than the comprehension? Anyone have any other tips for what I can do to speed things up? I'm looking into maybe converting some of the comprehension parts into lambdas, I'll have to test the speed on that to see if that will help or not. `compile` reduces code to bytecode, not machine code. Python has to compile everything you do anyway, so it caches your `.py` files as compiled `.pyc` files. Python compiling a list comprehension probably takes about 5 microseconds. The execution takes a further 5600000 microseconds. Also be aware that `print()` itself is very slow.
Shure, pseudo-code would look something like this: import pandas as pd data = pd.read_excel("path to file") data["column name"] = new_column_data data.to_excel("path to file") You'll find a bunch of pandas tutorials for basic and advanced stuff online.

&gt; Nope. That's not it. Get that notion out of your head, Believe me i think alot and alot on it, searched for hours and hours , this is the only possibility. Since how increasing the size of a dictionary would explain slowing of it's rate since, hashing is all what it does and increasing the size means more collision hence, my deduction. Nonetheless i could be wrong and will keep on trying things. &gt;Are you sure this problem fits in RAM, and that this isn't just a swapping issue? Yes since i am constantly monitoring the RAM usage and it's never full. &gt; It appears d2 is fully constructed before entering the loops you posted, and isn't being modified? Be sure the slowdown isn't in the creation of d2. Yeah d2 isn't being modified here and yes i've made sure of it since i'm using jupyter so i used separate cells for everything and only this cell is giving me this issue. I also started and stopped the timer before and after this loop only &gt; Is the code you posted a complete and accurate representation of the loops you have? Yes, since this is the only part that runs slow. &gt; I gave you suggestions for improvement, without any feedback Again, i apologize for it. I actually told this to other people that i tried your suggestion of replacing .update() and using not in etc. but this all doesn't have any major impact. &gt; Or just profile it. Yeah i will try my best to give it a whirl. Since i am new to this profiling stuff and really has to see how to do it before i actually do it.
Yes, I'm am iterating over everything several times. I'm compiling a list of search strings in a kinda Pokemon way... Gotta catch em all. I'm not resizing immutables. I'm primarily adding strings to a set. Well, in the old version. In the new version, adding strings to a dict then to a series, then to a dataframe

If it's your own function, I don't see what the advantage of `namedtuple` is besides iterability? If what you need is `dataclass` iterability, you can use the `astuple` function, or even make the `dataclass` iterable: ``` In [21]: from dataclasses import dataclass, astuple In [22]: @dataclass ...: class PointD(Sequence): ...: x: int ...: y: int ...: ...: def __getitem__(self, key): ...: return astuple(self)[key] ...: ...: def __len__(self): ...: return len(astuple(self)) ...: In [23]: p = PointD(2, 3) In [24]: tuple(p) Out[24]: (2, 3) ```
WhatsApp sucks....
Maybe this is a stretch, but I just released a package called PySimpleGUI that's a wrapper for tkinter. If you want to layout a custom tkinter form, then this is the easiest way by far. You can make custom layouts without having to worry about doing packs, etc. Take a look at the Cookbook and see if it may match your needs.....

Thanks! I'm already quite familiar with powershell and a quick learner so I'll probably just opt for the udemy since I don't plan on doing anything really with python anyways.
Thanks for taking the time to respond and provide a code example. I think we both can agree that namedtuples and dataclasses have overlapping functionality, and as such, both can solve very similar problems. However, there are use cases that extend beyond what's addressed by their common functionality, where the differences between the two can shine. NamedTuples are lightweight, you can have hundreds of thousands of them without the same overhead of custom classes or dataclasses. They preserve the underlying structure of the data: an immutable ordered collection with named fields. From the \[collection's API documentation\]([https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html)): \&gt; Named tuple instances do not have per-instance dictionaries, so they are lightweight and require no more memory than regular tuples. Perhaps I want to wrap a database result in a namedtuple, I do not need the extra functionality dataclasses provide, nor do I require mutability. I will want to preserve order. I will probably want to create a lot of them, and namedtuple's lower memory footprint can come into play. Moreover, namedtuples, like tuples themselves, are \*hashable\*, while unfrozen dataclasses aren't. In your example, you reimplemented some of namedtuple's functionality using the dataclasses API. At the end of the day, I reach for namedtuples and dataclasses so I \*don't\* have to spend more time implementing something that already exists. Check out this \[tweet\]([https://twitter.com/raymondh/status/995693882812915712](https://twitter.com/raymondh/status/995693882812915712)) by Raymond Hettinger. In his presentation, he compares and contrasts namedtuples and dataclasses.
Actually, part of the product I'm working on does deal with ACH, specifically, it does credit verification, but I'm in a different department, so I haven't seen it. I've seen a lot of FIX though. There was also some very strange creature, I think, it was developed for Chinese banks, which was a kind of a hybrid of C++ classes with the network protocol specification. That was a very weird thing indeed. I don't necessarily agree that JSON is ever a good thing. Even though I'm not a DBA, I strongly believe that the most important thing for any business is having a very good description of their data, and less so for the code dealing with data. To me, schema is the explanation of what the whole thing was intended to be, while code that works with it is just a one of possible things one could do with it. It will wither, go out of fashion, it will be refactored, outsourced, thrown away and completely rewritten, but schema is what defines the business. There are some good criticism of schemas, as, for example, in the context of SQL schemas, where you cannot refine it independently of the data described by the schema, which creates technological problems. But, I think those technological problems are worth solving, rather than giving up on schema entirely. The later being a non-solution to any problem. I also think that the protocol part of the application is where schema is most valuable, and as much effort as possible needs to be spent on enforcing it on parts of applications that need to work remotely. This keeps the whole thing from falling apart. Unfortunately, in many cases, the schema exists only in the minds of people writing the program, and disappears once they quit or forget what their initial intention was... and that's when the program becomes irrelevant.
Matrix math, use numpy. Otherwise, you've got a discrete set of operations that may be performed on an input matrix. Write a function for each operation. Then chain your operation calls together based upon the instruction set.

This is incredible! Thank you so much for sharing!
I actually like these a lot more than :=, as I think they do really improve things significantly for their usecases, whereas := is a lot more ambiguous, since places where you use it can end up very ugly looking. As such, I'm in favour of these, but not for :=. However, I suspect it's going to get caught up in the backlash against :=, so I suspect it won't get accepted.

I though they where going to take a break with the syntax peps after the whole assignment expression Guido-incident. I've always been a bit on the fence about this addition as it makes the language less readable, and for new programmers you need to explain a lot of content and conditions before they even start to understand what's going on, and for what? Making Null handling implicit instead of explicit. Just doesn't feel to pythonic to me. I mean it's useful for me, just like /@, @, // being synatxtic sugar for map, apply and postfix apply in mathematica. But I don't really feel that fits in python. 
I recommend openpyxl for changing spreadsheets in place. Pandas will create a new workbook, so you’ll lose all ya formatting.

&gt; NamedTuples are lightweight this is your only real point. &gt; you can have hundreds of thousands of them although for "thousands", lightweight makes no difference. I think if you profile, lightweight is only an issue when you have millions… &gt; like tuples themselves, are hashable, while unfrozen dataclasses aren't.

Fair enough, although that seems to be a failing of dataclass. &gt; Check out this tweet by Raymond Hettinger. In his presentation, he compares and contrasts namedtuples and dataclasses. Nice link! The only thing is that in his comparison, he lists a couple differences that are easily overridable: sortability, hashability, and frozeness can all be configured. Iterability is a fair point. If the Sequence mixin bugs you, then you can use namedtuple. Personally, I think of namedtuple as superseded by dataclass.

In not sure. Do you have a C compiler installed and python-devel packages? Check the numba docs.
I installed llvm-config with yum, which installs llvm 3.4, but now I get an error saying that building llvmlite requres llvm 6.0.x. I’ll look at the numba docs.

Yeah, appears llvm 3.4 is too old to get any llvmlite to build. The answer is probably to install a newer llvm.

This is interesting. I mostly use marshmallow because of its integration with apispec for generating Swagger docs. I can pass marshmallow schemas and it'll add them to the generated documentation. Any plans of writing an apispec plugin for this library?
&gt; this is your only real point. I'd like to think my real point was that both types have their strengths and weaknesses, and you should assess your usage of each to suit your business problem :) &gt; You keep mentioning the hashing, but you already know you want them to be frozen, so just mark them as frozen and you get hashing. You may have me confused with another poster, I've only mentioned hashing once. &gt; although for "thousands", lightweight makes no difference. I think if you profile, lightweight is only an issue when you have millions… In the context I'm thinking of, if one operation involves hundreds of thousands of these objects, using that operation in a parallel or concurrent context often means tens/hundreds of millions of objects. At that scale, memory footprint does matter. &gt; Personally, I think of namedtuple as superseded by dataclass. I like to think of them as complements. If you asked me, in the past, developers used namedtuples to solve problems where dataclasses would be more suitable. As in, namedtuples were chosen in an effort to bypass attribute assignment boilerplate.
That said, as others have noted, like R python is fast when it's C, though even 1.5M iterations of a simple function shouldn't come remotely near 45min. You want to get python out of the inner loops, entirely - no matter how spark on hotspot for example is as soon as it has to call down into a cpytho interpreter to run a lambda the user passed perf will completely die. 'Pure py' can still be fast if it has done it's job of gluing together fast things, including those that live in the stdlib (like the itertools and operator modules), or not as with numpy and tensorflow. If interpreted py is going to be in the inner loops no matter what your first thing to go for is, again as already mentioned, importing multiprocessing (well, billiard). And if you had a regex-less pure number workload numba could possibly help, it's remarkably high quality and capable at what it's for, but it unfortunately sounds like it's not for your usecase.
Profile your code. Check out cProfile in the standard library or use Pycharm's profiler. This will give you timing information for each function call, and the total number of calls for that function. Intuitively I'd say the speed difference (x2.5) is about what you'd expect for SSDs vs rotary drives given the concurrent access you're doing. I really can't say anything more without seeing your profile results.
Cue early 90s flash backs...
Hmm, I considered it might be related to drive IO... I guess I just hoped most of the data was being stored in the system memory vs virtual memory so the disk wouldn't be a major factor. I use PyCharm on my dev laptop to write the code, guess I need to install it on the prod machine as well. Thanks for the info, Monday I'll install PyCharm and run my code through the profiler and see what it says. I'm sure it will highlight more than a few places I need to optimize - our idea of Agile development is more about 2 week sprints and less about the planning phase. :\
You can always just comment out the numba lines and change prange to range
Perfect 5/7
If you are accessing spinning disks, you're going to get worse performance by having multiple processes competing for the same data. It's a bit of a tricky thing, because small-scale tests will only stress the hard drives' cache, and there it will look like you have good scaling. But when you get past that ~ 1 GB limit and start dealing with the 50-100 MB/s read rates of your hard drives, you will be quite penalized by trying to access data in divergent physical locations on the platter. RAID systems aren't really that much better: they have better throughput but they still stink at multiplexing. Explicitly parallel file access systems, such as those intended for scientific cluster computing, are better but they still don't scale at the level you may want them to. SSDs don't benefit from parallel access at all in my experience in benchmarking them. They are supposed to be better at random-access but in practice all I have seen is they are not penalized by it. Personally, what I would do is this: write a master process that deals with the IO. The master just keeps a constant flow of data coming off the platters, and then it dispatches that data to subprocesses via `concurrent.futures`. Don't try and write a system where multiple processes are competing for access to the same physical resource, it doesn't work.

oops, sorry!!
Huge fan of zeep. The maintainer has been pretty responsive of you can make a reproducible bug. Last time I checked suds had issues with async.
Pretty interesting! How does it compare with enforce https://github.com/RussBaz/enforce/ ?
*zeep* is modern, actively maintained library. I would recommend sticking with it. By the way it already uses *requests* and *lxml* under the covers. A few years ago the crown belonged to *suds* but it got abandoned by the original author. And no wonder. Dealing with SOAP is hard and thankless job. If you feel that you have to "hand code" the SOAP messages then look at *rinse* at least.
have you tried pyopencl?
I've got a use care where we convert a very flat csv file into 3rd normal form. Does this library work more for 1 row is 1 object. Is it designed to convert 1 row into many objects referencing unique keys in the database?
Thanks for the good feedback. :) As far as I can tell, enforce does not support: 1. Conversion or arguments into the parameters target types 2. `Optional` arguments being left out 3. Skipping superfluous arguments Option 1 can be useful to for example validate Arguments of an HTTP request that all come in as `str`. Option 2 can be useful for JSON parsing. Nullable types may be missing in the JSON object, for example because your application has a newer version of the DTO, which had this optional added. Option 3 can be useful for JSON parsing too. You application might just not care about every field in the JSON object. With undictify you explicitly can enable these things. Here is some code showing all three cases: from typing import Any, Dict, Optional from enforce import runtime_validation from undictify import type_checked_call @runtime_validation def enforced(value: int, msg: Optional[str]) -&gt; None: print(f'{value}, {msg}') @type_checked_call(skip=True, convert=True) def undictified(value: int, msg: Optional[str]) -&gt; None: print(f'{value}, {msg}') def main() -&gt; None: data_perfect: Dict[str, Any] = { 'value': 4, 'msg': 'hi' } data_convertible_type: Dict[str, Any] = { 'value': '4', 'msg': 'hi' } data_missing_optional: Dict[str, Any] = { 'value': 4, } data_superfluous_argument: Dict[str, Any] = { 'value': 4, 'msg': 'hi', 'superfluous': 3.14 } for data in [ data_perfect, data_missing_optional, data_convertible_type, data_superfluous_argument ]: try: print('\n=== enforced ===') enforced(**data) except Exception as ex: print(ex) try: print('\n=== undictified ===') undictified(**data) except Exception as ex: print(ex) if __name__ == "__main__": main() Output: === enforced === 4, hi === undictified === 4, hi === enforced === missing a required argument: 'msg' === undictified === 4, None === enforced === The following runtime type errors were encountered: Argument 'value' was not of type &lt;class 'int'&gt;. Actual type was str. === undictified === 4, hi === enforced === got an unexpected keyword argument 'superfluous' === undictified === 4, hi

There is nothing about this PEP that is implicit. Every single feature discussed in the PEP has a new explicit operator. The language syntax becomes larger, so the language takes more time to learn. That is a completely valid counterargument against this feature. But everything in this PEP is just syntactic sugar over already existing features, so there is little to no mental overhead once these concepts have been learned, the only change is that doing the right thing becomes less work. As for this feature making the language less readable, I honestly disagree. I find overly verbose languages like old-school Java to be hard to read, because it can literally take an entire screen full of code to express some very simple ideas. The naming of most standard functions in LISP is completely atrocious (car and cadr, really?), but aside from that, I find that language to be readable, because it allows you to express your ideas in a concise non-redundant way.
Add some random() to the login times :)
It's kinda hard to help you without seeing your code, sorry.
Try catch? 
&gt; It seems as if adjacent string literals are first interpreted according to their type and only then concatenated. Yep, pretty much: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/#concatenating-strings &gt; Adjacent f-strings and regular strings are concatenated. Regular strings are concatenated at compile time, and f-strings are concatenated at run time.
You can also read some doc about Regular expression(re) and OS for searching and finding words.
If you have a crazy idea, just try to do it in code. It's the best way to learn.
" GUIs are never simple." Perhaps it should be called PySimplerGUIThantkinterWxPythonQt I've not seen any reason why GUIs must be complex or difficult. Care to elaborate? Perhaps take a look at the package in detail and comment on what's not simple about it? Then I could at least do something. "What worries me is whether you can do something hard without hitting a brick wall. " Of course there are limitations. Not all of the tkinter widgets are supported. It's not meant for hard problems and nothing in the docs state that it solves hard GUI problems. Sounds like it's not for you.
You have to build this feature by yourself, there's no support to do this in Python or the OS. A clean way to do this is to set all the non-main threads as daemons; then block the main thread on on a queue or an event; when one of the other threads sends the quit event to the main thread it resumes and terminates, shutting down the whole process. In the daemon threads trap any exception and signal the main thread when an exception occurs. Otherwise you could make the process kill himself calling os.kill() inside the dying thread. I'm not entirely sure, but it should work.
Short-circuiting *or* is great, but this is not a use for it. `None` is not `False`, and even where it works in all possible cases, it's an abuse of semantics and should be considered a dirty hack. I still think `bool(None)` should be `None` and `bool(object())` should raise `NotImplementedError`. 
inb4 "Y THO" because it's awesome and OP probably learned a lot. Good Job, OP

Missing random import as well
Is it, though? you might have managed to get in before the question but i don't feel like your answer satisfy the Y part of it. I mean i could learn knitting and it would be awesome but y tho? Something in me just screams that OP must have felt for a reason to write a JVM in Python, that isn't just learning or fun. I feel like someone spend a ton of his time on this and if there isn't a good reason for. Can there be someone who does something like this for fun? There must be some need to justify this.
Seems good to me. I wouldn't like any behavior besides this. I was anticipating the groan/wtf moment and fortunately it never came. Well illustrated.
I mentioned this scenario in my original post. The problem is that my Pipfile references directories in my project, so I have to copy in at least those directories as well. This is better than copying in everything, but not by a lot since these directories change quite frequently as well. I guess I’ll make a feature request for “only install external dependencies” or something.
The world would be a much poorer place if every venture was undertaken for a "good" reason. End results don't always matter (though OP's is cool), and they're certainly not all you gain from making something like this.
num=int(input("enter a number u guess"))
Y THO Great job OP. Couple of questions: 1. I didn't have time to read through the whole source code, but how are you handling memory management? 1. How much of Java API is supported? 1. Which resources were you using when writing this JVM? Something besides JVM spec?
You can use [cProfile](https://docs.python.org/2/library/profile.html#profile.run) to have profiling information written to a file. This doesn't require any additional tools because it is part of the standard library. Profiling will usually slow execution down so I'd recommend to make profiling not the default! 
&gt; Can there be someone who does something like this for fun? I don't know, as OP.
Perhaps OP wanted to have a deeper understanding of the JVM architecture and chose python to implement it as python is handy enough to just jump into without a lot of boilerplate code. And he did specify it's a TOY, as in just coding for love of coding.
If you want to remove the escaping why not simply print said dictionary without the json.dumps()?
Am I the only one who's surprised by how little code it took to accomplish this? I was expecting long dense files of hundreds of lines each. Nice job, OP. What resources did you use to learn how to make this? 
What resources did you use to learn about JVMs to be able to write this?
You need the slashes for it to be JSON. Otherwise the unescaped doublequotes terminate the string
Philosophically, SQLAthanor assumes one CSV record corresponds to one model instance. However, if your CSV actually represents a more normalized collection of (multiple) objects, there are two relatively simple strategies you can use that will make the data easier to work with (which of the two makes the most sense will depend on your data structure / contents): **Separate Your CSV Record** If your CSV record represents multiple objects (e.g. columns 1 - 5 represent object type 1, columns 6 - 15 represent object type 2, column 1 + column 16-20 represent object type 3, etc) you can split your CSV record before serialization. Thus you would read the columns for your first object from the CSV record and then send them (as a string) to `ObjectType1.from_csv()` to create an instance of object type 1. Then read the columns for your second object, and send them as a string to `ObjectType2.from_csv()` and so on. This would be the best strategy to use if your CSV record represents multiple (related) objects of the same type, but it will also work fine if it represents multiple objects of *different* types. **Abstract Master Record** If your CSV record represents objects of *different* types that you want to normalize into 3NF, a good pattern to use might be an abstract master record. Basically, the way this works is you define a master model (let’s call it `MasterObjectType`) that has an attribute `__abstract__ = True`. This means it can be instantiated and works normally, but does *not* actually correspond to a relational database table (it’s “abstract”). For each of the smaller objects described by your CSV record, you’d create regular (not abstract) models like `SubType1`, `SubType2`, etc. The `MasterObjectType` model would get attributes corresponding to *all* of the columns in your CSV record. Now, you can de-serialize your CSV record by calling `MasterObjectType.from_csv()` and you now have access to whatever data you need to create sub-object types. You can do that manually by calling `sub_type_instance = SubType1(master_id = master_instance.id, column1 = master_instance.column1, column2 = master_instance.column2)` etc. You can also do it more easily (more maintainably) with a method on `MasterObjectType` like `get_sub_type_1()` which instantiates and returns a `SubType1` instance whose data is populated from the master object. You can even do it using a read-only `@property` on `MasterObjectType` that returns an instance of `SubType1` whose data is populated from the master object. **Other Normalization Tricks** While this is not strictly a SQLAthanor trick, one technique that might be useful is to rely on hybrid properties in your SQLAlchemy model. Often, I’ve found when normalizing flat data (especially large data sets) consistency of data can be important and hard to maintain (e.g. keeping the value of an “age” column consistent with the value of a “birthdate” column). You can do that in your model by creating a hybrid `age` property that is read-only and always calculated based on the `birthdate` column. Thus, when you de-serialize your CSV data you only populate your independent properties, and your transitively dependent properties will be computed on-the-fly by your SQLAlchemy model. For more on hybrid properties, here is a link to the relevant SQLAlchemy docs: http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/extensions/hybrid.html Hope this helps!
Depending on the volume of images you might consider the Amazon Rekognition Image API. https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/pricing/ It costs $1.00 per 1,000 images but you can get the first 5,000 per month free for 12 months in the AWS Free Tier.
Yeah, it's super clean. Love the use of decorators in machine.py to reduce the length of the inevitable monster IF statement.
I had a look at the source code, it's super compact. Memory management is standard python lists and dicts. If you look in the stdlib folder, there are like 5 classes supported, Math and Rand are just passthroughs to the python module.
This question should be posted on /r/learnpython Anyway the json.dumps() works exactly the way you want it just when you use it on the interactive interpreter the output is the representation that escapes special characters with backslashes. If you want to see how the JSON really looks like use print as suggested by another poster, for example print(json.dumps(variable))
Oh! ok!! thanks !!
The current official Python tutorial in the documentation still contains extremely frequent references. [This page](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html) alone contains *at least* three - dead parrot, cheese shop, and spam.
God, people like you are the worst... this is Reddit's mindset in general toward hobbies, too. "If it's not *useful* why would you ever bother?"
I totally see this post being a little tongue-in-cheek, but the rationale for this kind of thing for me is the same kind of rewarding feeling you get from solving puzzles, along with the rewarding feeling you get from learning something new that you're interested in. Those goals can be reason enough without any greater end goal in mind.
A quick note, no PEPs are being considered for approval right now until there is a new process in place to approve PEPs. This will likely happen early 2019.
Yeah, because it's reasonable. If you hobby is programming jvms good for you, but if you just like programming there's like a hundred open source projects where you'd do basically the same but while you do it achieve something very useful. So the choice isn't do something i think is useless (at this point nobody answered me how this could be used in any way, so i just assume other than a proof of concept it is basically useless) or do nothing. It is do something useless or do basically the same thing while doing something useful. It's a very small but important difference to me. 
No but you can use this to run jython
Do not post beginner tutoruals
I've learned a lot about string in Python, rushter. Thank you! 
i was definitely aware that i am poking a bear here, but i am definitely a cynic at heart so it's probably more like me than i'd like to admit. And i like your answer a lot more, it doesn't default to "it's awesome - well done!" like every soccer mom ever. I am pretty sure OP is proud of his achievement and he should be. Still probably a very rarely used niche, as far as i know both python and java are c based, so if you can run one of them you should be able to run the other one without too much trouble. Though there might be some very limited systems where it comes in handy. And not the ideal thing to learn something new just too big and clunky in my opinion. But then again i spend way too much time reinventing the wheel myself and when i look back at the younger me i had similar experiences and they not only made me a better programmer and understand the problem they also taught me when i should just take what's already there and use it without overthinking - one of the most important lessons i have ever learned. 
Oh, sorry but the time I got here I had forgotten the full context of your question. It's hard to say anything further without looking at the Dockerfile/Pipfile combination, but it sounds like these directories with extra dependencies don't need to be installed at all (i.e.: no fancyness in a setup.py or similar to make it usable), is that right? If so, couldn't you remove them from the pipfile and use the dependencies directly in your code? I mean, adding them to the import path via PYTHONPATH, or modifying `sys.path` in runtime, or ADDing it on a later layer.
That is extremely clever. High five, OP! You have lots of `if: ... elif` blocks. You should look into replacing those with dicts mapping opcodes to functions. While the function calls add some overhead, I think you’d likely still see a net speed up from replacing the O(number_of_opcodes) linear scan with a O(1) dict lookup. Alternatively, maybe profiling would show that some opcodes are called much more often, and you could move those to the top of the `if` blocks so that they’re found faster than the less common ones.
Neat tool. I like the dumping part. I'm not sure why it needs to handle loading too though. Also, what's with the django integration?
Maybe using GraalVM
&gt;Because everything is set up in a creature class, I'm having a hard time finding a way to generate new instances during runtime :( We'll need to see some of your code, but there's no reason this should make it harder. You just make a new \`Creature\` instance whenever you need one. (Also, this would be better on r/learnpython)
This is such a broad, unanswerable question. Learning anything new is useful and worth it. Why should you do anything? Do you want to learn python? If yes then learn it.
What do you mean "is it worth it"?
Never used python before, I'm working on a script that will send a text message to my phone at an utterly random time. Trying to make it dynamic now.
Yes, it is. 
well i didn't have to do that for my cs degree. We actually had to program a fully working runtime analyzer for logic circuits and just general graphs. I learned a lot while doing it just like you did and i also could use my new tool in other courses to figure out minimal runtimes, race conditions and optimal routes though graphs. So i'd go back and complain because people could have made you learn and making something useful at the same time. But at least they didn't make you develop a full blown jvm at least you've got that going for you.
&gt; i was aware that i am poking a bear here, but i am definitely a cynic at heart No. You're an asshole at heart. 
isn't that basically the definition of cynic?
It's not a broad, unanswerable question. If You spend months learning a language and at the end, can't even get a job, then it's clearly not worth it. 
i guess downvote means yes?
But you never said your goal was to get a job
No. A cynic is someone who believes that people are motivated by their own self interest rather than altruism. You're being an asshole to OP because you don't seem to understand that someone could derive enjoyment or knowledge from building something. 
You ever look at a rock and think, "huh, I bet I could climb that"? Nothing useful would come out of it, but you just kind of want to anyway, just to see if you can?
Job market determines if it's worth it or not, i'm not gonna waste months learning something i can't benefit from. What's the point? To tell other people "hey i know python!" 
it depends on what you want out of life
Hi there, this post has been removed as it is not directly related to the Python programming language. It might be more topical on /r/programming, /r/coding, or /r/technology. Cheers, /r/Python mods
Not everything is about you mate.
Wrote a script to examine two sets of polygon data files and compute their area and intersected areas for overlap coverage by using their WGS84 projections in ECEF with the help of Newell's method for determining the equation of a plane in 3D. Complexity is currently O(n^2) [for each polygon p, for each polygon q] but will get that down to hopefully O(n) or O(nlog(n)) by using an R-Tree!
So, explain to me how you're distrustful of OP's motivations for writing this. Or are you just trying to hide your terrible personality behind terms that make it sound sophisticated? 
OP never mentioned his motivation i checked his post and the answers and his git, i actually really want to know his motivation. But all i get is your shitty comments.
No i don't agree, you can do useless small projects to practice, but it is another thing to repeat it for 5 libs and i don't know how many functions. I guess if i'd really want to make sure i don't forget how i have done this and i really want to burn it into my brain because its fucking important to me. But in general 1. function to figure it out, 2. function to make sure, 3. now i've got it and after that it is just wasting time. I like to learn new skills i just hate repetitive tasks. So as long as it serves a purpose i am fine with anything, i mean i go running that should be proof enough.
I don't have a CS degree (studied applied math). I've worked as a data scientist and data engineer for 10 years and now consider myself a software developer more or less. I use Python every day, along with Java, Scala, JavaScript and I'm trying to get into Go. The degree doesn't really define anything
&gt; **i know** why would it be, don’t you see **how i** am trying to teach people to make better decisions here. Completely **selfless of me**, but as always people don’t listen and **i end up with** another JVM **i will never use**. lol ok good for you
it is isn't it :D
&gt; The degree doesn't really define anything AP math is still a strong degree and people will take you more seriously than someone who doesn't have a degree or has a shitty art or cooking (idk what it's called) degree
Whatcha using Go for over in the data science world? I've been using it for prototyping systems applications and I actually prefer it to python because pointers. Wouldn't mind migrating some scripts over
If you want to program for your own entertainment and convenience then I would argue that Python is probably the best language to learn. It's a pleasure to program in, and makes it easy to do sophisticated things. If you want to be a software engineer, you're going to need to learn half a dozen languages or more over time, and Python is a pretty great language to learn first. It is true that other languages are in higher demand globally, and Python jobs are competitive because lots of people want to work in Python, so if your goal is to get a job as quickly as possible, Python might not be the best possible choice. If you really want to get a job as quickly as possible, Javascript would be my guess for the best entry route - everyone needs javascript programmers, and no one wants to program in javascript if they don't have to. That said, I think whatever language you will enjoy and actively engage with is the winning choice. At the end of the day, a good software engineer should be able to pick up a new language in a couple months, and which particular language you start with is nowhere near as important in the long run as you probably think it is. Lots of employers don't even care about your particular language skills, and just look to hire good engineers in any language.
Maybe not the answer you were looking for, but [here](http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) is a great article outlining how you might write a simple one in python. Has source code as well if you want to just use it as a naive implementation until you find something suitable
I started learning two weeks ago. I'm working on learning lol. 
When's the last time you interacted with another person in real life? work or school doesn't count
Crosswords and jigsaw puzzles don't hurt or bother anyone but i still think they could just do something more productive with their time. To be honest i consider those two tasks less repetitive and boring than writing a JVM. Maybe OP automated it, that would be pretty neat. My guess is those people are just bored and need something to do and i don't really know how to apply the skills for those tasks, so go for it. I won't ask you every five seconds why you do it, i mostly don't care. But if you build a car out of wood i will ask you why! yeah you did learn something and you probably had fun but you could have build a boat instead. But the other examples, people gain death or just dead body parts by climbing mountains and going to the poles (can actually recommend the book about the race to the south pole it's pretty interesting). And even though i think seeing something for the first time is fun and you have the chance of discovering something i was never a big risk guy. And let them vote it's actually an interesting experience i think this is my most downvoted comment yet and people seem to be really passionate about this being not useless.
A way to graph the S&amp;P 500 returns versus the S&amp;P 500 Total Return (the return if you reinvested dividends).

What do you mean, "does not work well"? Do they crash your computer? Don't find misspelled words? Misidentify correctly spelled words as misspelled?
You can't directly catch an exception in a different thread.
What do you think?
Why would you spend time reading a book about a race to the South Pole? Because it's fun and interesting, and you might even learn something? Seems like an awful waste of time to me. /s
Execute “crontab -e” with EDITOR set to point to a script that will scan the temporary file passed as argv[1] and add the entry only if it is not already there. 
well i didn't learn anything, but it did it to waste some time and i wouldn't read it again. So if you delete the /s we mostly agree. I guess you are almost a sensible person.
This blog post displays exactly the sort of confused idea I feared when f-strings were first proposed. The blog post's conclusion says: &gt; It seems as if adjacent string literals are first interpreted according to their type and only then concatenated. but that's nonsense. There is only one string type. f-strings *aren't strings*. They are code which is evaluated and returns a string, not a second type of string. They are best thought of as conceptually similar to a call to `str(eval(s))` rather than a type of string. # f-strings are just regular strings py&gt; type(f'') is type('') True # except that they evaluate arbitrary code first py&gt; f'{print("Surprise".upper() + "!") is None}' SURPRISE! 'True' The correct interpretation is that f-strings are evaluated first, returning strings, and then concatenated at runtime. String literals are concatenated at compile time: py&gt; import dis py&gt; dis.dis("s = 'a' 'b'") 1 0 LOAD_CONST 0 ('ab') 2 STORE_NAME 0 (s) 4 LOAD_CONST 1 (None) 6 RETURN_VALUE py&gt; dis.dis("s = f'{a}' f'{b}'") 1 0 LOAD_NAME 0 (a) 2 FORMAT_VALUE 0 4 LOAD_NAME 1 (b) 6 FORMAT_VALUE 0 8 BUILD_STRING 2 10 STORE_NAME 2 (s) 12 LOAD_CONST 0 (None) 14 RETURN_VALUE 
I've recently created a youtube channel for new python developers. I remember when I started learning python I had to go through all the boring videos and tutorials. For not too long ago i choose to create a youtube channel [Right Here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRwX4lIa7u8RjCrjBVQjD6A?view_as=subscriber). The goal is basically to make coding fun to the newcommers. It's a hobby thing. Everytime anyone clicks on a video in youtube or any other video forum, you fall asleep during the video. 
Great article. I fail to understand why it didnt draw more attention. Thanks.
Port it to Python 2 and run Jython on it to run this on Jython... Just saying.
The hate train has no brakes.
I’m on mobile so I can’t type it out really, but couldn’t you just grab each paragraph by specifying carriage return as your separation and then post one each hour?
Pardon my ignorance, but how does it avoid the recursion limit? It must run into it sometime, right? If so, then won’t sys.setrecursionlimit suffice?

In a tail-position (directly before returning) a function call does not have to be executed by jumping into the function and remembering the function it came from, because there is nothing more to be done there (other than just returning). This is why such calls, even when recursive, can be made to not blow up the call stack. You can read up about tail-call elimination if you are unfamiliar with the concept. Otherwise I'd of course be glad to guide you through the concrete implementation.
&gt;Port it to Python 2 I hope that's the the last time I ever read that statement.
Have your threads update a watchdog counter that is monitored by a timer. If the counter is not updated to an expected number within a certain time period(adjusting for jitter), then shutdown your main program.
Wow you sounded like a cunt from your question and you exceeded expectations. I wasn't asking for help debugging. I was asking if someone knew of a good spellchecking package. Your question was stupid and irrelevant. Now go back to whatever basement you crawled out from.
Didn't mean to offend. I was offering the perspective I have on evaluating GUI frameworks, which is that only so much can be done to hide the underlying complexity of any GUI. So when one is proposed I'm not looking for a minimal example but a basic one, and as the user mentioned whether or not I can reach under the hood and how easily. 
Awesome, thanks for this.
Try tweepy, I have used it and with a wait call you can achieve what you need. Not elegant but functional
This summer I used TensorFlow to make and train a neural network that takes in noisey complex interferometry data and identifies the slope of the phase angle. This week I am finalizing the structure so that I can make my first official package. 
I got a big full of useless proof of concept idea implementations. It is fun until the puzzle is solved.
Not sure you meant to put this here OP, but I'm gonna go ahead and remove it.
Sorry. My bad.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but this doesn't eliminate tail recursion but pushes it from stack to heap? Comments explaining how the code works would be helpful.
Essentially instead of calling a function in a tail position a function returns a structure representing the call, which will then be executed outside of the function. That way it doesn't nest deeper and deeper recursively, but instead gets handled in a flat while loop.
Yeah, but that's not tail recursion, you'll still run out of memory trying to evaluate def add(x, y): if y == 0: return x return add(x + 1, y - 1) for a large enough number. True tail call elimination would eliminate the memory overhead entirely.
Tail call elimination would need PEP approval so as you'd have to tackle the metaproblem of Python governance first.
Does a thread that is terminated ungracefully send a quit or abort signal? If it does, this is a good solution.
Lol effortposting
Oh, I see. Yeah, this is proper tail recursion.
**Comment of a random guy reading you 2:** To be honest, and taking into account your "what do you think" answer, you deserved what /u/stevenjd said in his previous comment.
Attempting to learn the basics of Kivy for the 4th time, without running head-first into a wall.
Thanks to both of you for the replies. Very well explained. I appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts. There have been some suggestions of offering different frameworks under psg such as WxPython and Qt. I'm not yet trying to capture the attention of the professionals looking to write a serious application with a complicated GUI. I'm looking for low-hanging fruit at the moment. I see beginners and advanced users looking to save a lot of time when throwing a GUI onto the front end of a quick little program. If a feature is not in psg currently, and you think your project will eventually need that missing feature, then it's best to steer clear of psg for that project. Thanks for pointing out the with-block error.
What are you trying to achieve
It makes 'c' an instance of itself, you can use it (as an instance) without calling it.
And the weird thing, is that when you try to evaluate 'c', it says that it is a class.
Still doesn't make sense, but I have a feeling you are looking for `staticmethod`
Do you mean like adding `print(C.a)` after the class declaration? That raises `AttributeError: type object 'C' has no attribute 'a'`. Again, can you post a full example that can be ran as a Python file?
Uhh, basically you just wrote something that you don't even understand yourself and you'll telling /r/Python to "try this".. I suggest you to head over to /r/learnpython
Automate the Boring Stuff is a very good and free avaiable book for learning Python: [https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter1/](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter1/). Also r/learnpython might be a better place for this.
I think you're confused by python classes being objects themselves
I don't have a full example. Btw, variables declared like `self.var` doesn't seem to work, but those who are just like `var` seems to work.
No
Yes. I know how your code works, but you are doing it in a terribly wrong way. I think you need to learn the following concepts: * class * class instance * static method * instance method If you have further questions, please head over to /r/learnpython.
Well you're doing a really bad job of explaining what you found and why it's interesting
Um, I'm sorry but, I'm not a beginner, I just found this weird, just try it!
Oh sorry, but you are certainly a beginner to me. Even your explanation of your own code is wrong.
Tell me, did you ever wrote `self = self()`?
I learned Python by understanding the language, not by randomly typing things that don't make sense.
I didn't learn that way!
I just felt like I should experiment randomly
So you are indeed doing things you don't understand. You can't even explain your code correctly. "Not a beginner", I see.
Man, that's why I posted it, because I didn't understand it!
Well, then I can't reproduce whatever you are seeing. I can't imagine what it would do anyway - the only way for something like `self = self()` to not raise an exception is if the class implements `__call__`, and even then, the name `self` is just reassigned to the result of that value and immediately discarded. It certainly does not turn the class into an instance of itself, as you wrote in the other thread.
This is why you should post it in /r/learnpython instead of here.
I was with you in the other thread where someone called you an asshole, but your approach here is pretty shitty. Asking why because you don't get it is reasonable. Judging others for doing harmless things that have nothing to do with you is peak asshattery.
If you don’t feel like reading a book, read the official documentation. It is not really friendly, google terms you don’t understand but don’t be too picky, just go through it. Then stackoverflow and google will be your best resources.
True true. I did plenty of coding as part of my degree, so not like I started with nothing. But I do miss some CS fundamentals I've had to absorb on the job
Not much on the DS side, more on the implementation of models and services in production, which is more where I focus (call that data engineering maybe). Go is a general learning goal for me, but one thing I want to try is writing some gRPC services for a real time system

Is this satire?
Great job with this byte-code interpreter. Calling it a JVM though seems questionable.
Would love to see some detailed documentation on this, talking about things like implementation and language support. Based on a preliminary examination of the code it isn't clear the extent to which this would be comparable to a true JVM.
This is something that I very incidentally needed for work. Pretty cool!
&gt; It seems as if adjacent string literals are first interpreted according to their type and only then concatenated. Perhaps rather than a catastrophic misunderstanding, this is just a poor choice of words? Better would be: "It seems as if adjacent string literals are first interpreted according to their kind, and only then concatenated." That works for me.
Not like it's a big deal anyway-- you don't see people complaining about Java's lack of TRO
Thank you. I’ll try rinse before going to lxml.objectify and response if not successful. Still waiting from zeep creator feedback...
Some people actually enjoy programming and do it for fun, like me.
i don't judge them i just question their decision making.
Great work! I wonder how to handle authentication and authorization in your framework.
Interesting, I would've expected older values of `result` to be garbage collected. Do they end up sticking around?
Can anyone explain like I'm five? I understand that is something to run Java code with python by importing the class, can anyone correct me? 
Python 3.7 changed ABI (application binary interface). Virtual environment can only help you with Python code, but not C code. You must've had something like NumPy, Tornado, Pandas, Pillow etc. which compiled with older ABI. Now, all of these became incompatible with the new ABI, but, I don't believe that a lot of them had already updated to match the new ones. I'd wait another few months before updating. It takes a while to patch these packages, especially since they might be relying on Cython, and Cython in its turn needs to update to match new API. For some, the dependency change is even longer: they need NumPy to update, which needs Cython to update. So, don't hold your breath.
This may be obvious, but I will ask it anyways: did you check the network adapter parameters / settings? I mean, throughput of the network adapter might be a bottleneck here. But, sometimes innocuous things, like MTU can make a lot of difference. If you considered using multiprocessing, and you *can* use multiprocessing: do it. If you can use a different language with actually working parallelism: even better.
Somebody offered me a project to translate lot of code written in Fortran to Python. The old code is basically about Missile design systems which is quite interesting. I'm working on that only for this past week and this weekend.
I’ve found counter is a good replacement for do-while loops: index = 0 limit = 10 x = op(index) while x is not None and index &lt; limit: x = op(index) -&gt; for index in counter(0): if index == limit: break x = op(index) if x is None: break It’s made my code a lot cleaner.

Presumably you mean itertools.count? (as opposed to collections.Counter)
Node takes 2 parameters, data (which you're setting to 3), and value which is optional and defaults to 0. See how earlier in your code you pass it two numbers? You can try print(Node(3,3).value) and see if that does what you want. Also if you don't need the default of value to be 0, then you could change value=0 to just value in the definition of Node, and then you'll get an error if you don't pass both parameters every time and avoid this mistake.
You can integrate with flask-login for cookie-based session management. I check if a user is authenticated / authorized(to that endpoint) in app.before\_request. I also implemented token-based authentication where I set a "bearer token" in the authorization header to work with CORS, but I haven't documented this (yet). Fine-grained access control to individual resources can be implemented in the constructor of the model instance, but this depends on how you want your ACL implemented. I think the endpoint routing is pretty straightforward which makes protection against indirect object references easy. If something isn't clear, feel free to open an issue in the repo.
Thanks! I’ll tweak the homepage a bit.
I program a ton in Mathematica too. Love the language. I love the syntactic sugar especially, but for a lot time I had absolutely no fucking clue what was going in other people's code or mine since I was copying and pasting and just fiddling till I got stuff quite right. Now I can read a single line of code that generates an alternate dimension, but it really hurt me as a beginner. I know it turns people off Mathematica all the time since they find it unreadable. Fancy language features are great if you're an advanced user, but newbies will open the source code and just close it since it's too much for them. Being able to explore the code of the libraries you're using and being able to understand them after a week with the language is one of Python's greatest strengths. The quality of my code is entirely the result of reading good code by others and easily understanding it. That said, some sugar could be a good thing, but it has to be limited and carefully thought about. The ternary operator is one of those things that seems to have worked out great for the language even if people choose not to implement it. 
I did note the "stronger" use of the word type as I used it; but couldn't think of a better alternative. If you don't mind, I would like to update my post to use the word kind as you suggest. (Ahh, the diplomacy of open-source :-)
It should send sigterm or sigint. You could register a signal handler in your main process.
There aren't PySide2 wheels for the Raspberry Pi. Your best bet would likely be to build PySide2 from source, or ask on the PiWheels project (https://github.com/bennuttall/piwheels) for them to build one for you.
You could just build an API in Python and use that from wherever... Personally, I'd avoid WP..
&gt; while x is not None Another lesser known equivalent expression of that, is: while x Just a fun fact.
Not equivalent. It behaves differently on 0, empty lists, etc. 
Nope 0, False, None, list(), {}, "", 0.0 will all evaluate as falsy and stop your loop. 
Pure python? Not possible. At least you’d have to use some PHP to get your widget shown. And if you wanted to do it properly you should write an plugin for WP (in PHP) which is an interface to your API. But if your API is a Flask app, you couldn’t really communicate with WP that well, because you’d have to use the resources directly or you could maybe use the WP-cli but there is no elegant solution to this.
Manager's name?
No, I just misunderstood how it works, I thought that it builds the entire chain first then evaluates it.
yes, but these names have been deprecated since 3.5, and are a case for "would usually show warnings already in python 3.6".
I certainly am not going to claim ownership of the word "kind". Update your blog post as you wish! :)
Except that f-strings are not string literals. They are executable code.
The name is misleading. They aren't strings, they are executable code which must be evaluated at runtime to return a string. I posted output of the disassembler showing the byte-codes an f-string compile to. It is completely different from the byte-code a string is compiled to. Would you call this a string, or a function? def spam()-&gt;str: return ''.join([str(a), str(b+1), str(d).upper(), str(e)]) The main differences between a function and an f-strings are that you have to explicitly call the function (f-strings are evaluated implicitly), and that f-strings can only return a string. But otherwise, they're more similar than not: f-strings can have side-effects, and they can evaluate any number of legal expressions: py&gt; f'{[x+1 for x in range(5)] + [999]}' '[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 999]' Putting aside whether or not f-strings are useful, or desirable, the name is misleading and the differences significant: - string literals can be concatenated at compile-time; - f-strings cannot be (in general); - string literals are data; - f-strings are code; - strings are a data type (like `int`, `list`, etc); - f-strings are not, they are a syntactic feature, like comprehensions. If you don't think these are relevant differences, I don't know what to say.
ipython lets you append a `?` to a thing to bring up the help menu for it. import sys sys? a = object() a? This PEP proposal adds the following syntax (a?.b ?? d).c = 1 This would make ipython’s `?` macro not work. Also, that example I posted just now looks awful. I don’t even know what it means glancing at it. 
Also, `[]` is falsy. 
But with these semantics it's a statement anyway, and therefore doesn't need to provide combinability like an expression. 
Lexically, they are string literals. The compiler produces different bytecode for an f-string than for an r-string or a u-string, but they are all string literals.
I’m gonna be honest with you and say I have no idea what you said … it’s not your fault tho, my python/programming isn’t that great :). But I’ll take your word for it. I just responded here cause I use jupyter and he ? helper a lot. 
&gt; while x This is useful when you'll be pushing/popping a list, like in a tree traversal.
Yeah, I’m confident the network is configured properly - that’s actually more my realm of expertise than programming. That said, there could be limitations further up the line (my org can get pretty aggressive with monitoring and throttling at times), but my laptop and prod machine sit on two ports on the same switch with the same config so anything like that should affect both. I actually have been working to learn C# and was thinking of moving the code into that. I can live with a 3-4hr processing time if necessary, but I was hoping my problem would be something simple enough that I could just fix it in place without a massive overhaul that I probably won’t be given the time to properly perform.
&gt; I'm not familiar with a library that will be of much use here Oh. I was hoping that this problem would fall into some well-known category of problems. &gt; Are the timestamps discrete Conversation starts are recorded at 1ms granularity, and the entire set of ~35000 conversations get done in about 3 minutes. That works out to 180000 time samples. &gt; Is the beginning of a conversation part of that conversation? Yes. In my example, there are two conversations at timestamp 1. The end of the conversation is not included though. E.g. at timestamp 3, there are two conversations in progress (A and B). C just ended at timestamp 3, so C is not counted. &gt; From 4 to 5, there were also three conversations taking place. Would that also be a valid answer to the first question? Yes, thanks, I didn't notice that. What I'd like the library to return is a list of dicts: def busiest_times(): ... return [{'ts_range':[2,3], 'conversations':['A', 'B', 'C']}, {'ts_range':[4,5], 'conversations':['A', 'B', 'D']}]
Rava dosa :D 
Have a look at OpenCV Haar Cascade: Haar cascade algorithms are a form of machine learning, but they do not use Neural Networks - so no Deep Learning is involved. The underlaying principle of haar cascade was proposed by **Paul Viola** and **Michael Jones** in their very interesting paper ["Rapid object dete3ction using a boosted cascade of simple features"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/990517/) is easy to understand yet geniously efficient and smart. The haar cascade algorithms tries to identify simple features in grayscaled images. Such a simple feature can be edges, lines or rectangles. An edge is described as a sharp change in contrast from bright to dark in either horizontal or vertical direction. So whenever the haar cascade algorithm sees a square of pixels which follows that property, it marks them them as an edge feature. The whole subset of the image is scanned for edges, lines and rectangles. The haar cascade algorithms chooses a first subset of the image with a certain size and identifies all these simple features. For a face detecting algorithm, haar cascade identifies over 200 features. One such feature may be a line between the eyebrow and the eye itself, another one a sharp contrast between around the iris. Finally, he compares the features he identified with a model which contains such feature-descriptions of faces. When the features he identified match to a certain degree with the models description of the optimal features, the haar cascade algorithm marks the subset he is currently scanning as a "face". Note that haar cascade is by no means limited to face detection, even though it might be the biggest field it is applied to. There are cascades for many different objects like eyes, number plates, chairs, animals and many more. All of them base on the principle of identifying simple features and combining them to match high-level objects. Taken from [this github repo](https://github.com/joelbarmettlerUZH/FaceClassification_Tensorflow)
Stopped reading as the first example only supported \*args and not being smart to also capture and pass \*\*kwargs. C'mon people this isn't hard.

Tangential question: Is there a fn in python that is like 'take n' so you could do something like take(10,map(fn,items)) ?
Have you heard of Kivy? Just a suggestion.
2 years in the making, large bitmap/vector PyQt5-based graphic design application with animation and prototyping features here. Something like a modernized version of Adobe Fireworks. 98% Python, the rest is in a C++ dll doing all the low-level cpu-intensive pixel stuff like imaging filters, boolean operations on vector paths etc. For those here worried about Python real-world performances: the thing is compiled with Cython for distribution, but runs CPython-interpreted on my system for development and I'm still amazed at the fact that application reactivity and memory usage are perfectly on par with similar applications coded with more traditional techniques (read: C++).

What python version do you have? `@` is new in 3.5.
Designing a generator function or using iter and a for loop is a great and literate way to replace a `while True`. I've used the pattern quite a bit with good results. I just feel like `while True` is such a kludge since it forces the logic to be scattered throughout the block rather than centralized in a generator/iter.
You should start by reading the sidebar.
This sounds like exactly what you need, I’ve had good success with it: https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition Check out the gif in the README 
On the off chance your not that dudes alt. No, not understanding someone's motivations doesn't make you an asshole. Demanding to know someone's motivations, shitting all over their thing and a general better-than-thou attitude makes you an asshole.
&gt; This one still looks like it's going to make it in there. Citation needed. Hettinger is against it. A three-year-old PEP adding a controversial special operator, right after the community split over a controversial special operator, is the wrong change at the wrong time. I see zero chances.
The WordPress ecosystem seems good but it’s actually bad. All the plugins are very low quality and can be replaced easily in a better system. 
Reddit doesn't support triple-backtick. Put four spaces before each line of code.
Well all I'm saying is that I didn't get the same vibe from his comments that you did, probably because I can understand both viewpoints on the "y tho" question that started this. 
Try this while True: try: myTrainingDataGeneratingScript() except Exception as e: print(e) continue
I think you want to look at this more as an algorithm than finding a library. The problem looks a bit like the structure of dynamic scheduling algorithms if you squint, but that's more about if you were given all the conversations how would you schedule them - perhaps the data structures might be related. The naive algorithm I'd start with would be: times = [] for conv in conversations: for i in range(conv.start, conv.env): times[i] += 1 That should give you a list of times, where `times[i]` is the number of conversations at time i. There's almost certainly a more efficient way to do it, but it's probably worth just trying that to see if it gets what you want and is quick enough. Then you can find the max value in that list, then find every index with that value, and then you can find the intervals from there with the same conversations.

I'm having 3.6.4 installation. But @ operator is specific to numpy right?
It seems like it raises an exception. If you like see what kinds of exception it raises, do this ```python import sys while True: try: myTrainingDataGeneratingScript() except Exception as err: for exc in sys.exc_info(): print(exc) print('error message: ', err) ``` If you find the raised exception, it is better to catch explicitly rather than passing silently. Here is the line 10 of The Zen of Python: "Errors should never pass silently."
`??` silently eats exceptions, in addition to providing an alternative to `None`? Kill it with fire. How much support has this received on python-dev?
i tryed this and it just loops this output after the script run once "'module' object is not callable"

i dont really get an error from my script i get this "'module' object is not callable" once it trys to run it a second time
`chain.from_iterable(iterable)` is definitely the one I use most often. I wish it could always be shortened to `chain(*iterable)` but that unpacks the full iterable before chaining, which is not usually desirable. 
&gt; 'module' object is not callable Then, you are calling a module object instead of a function of the module. Don't do "myTrainingDataGeneratingScript()", try myTrainingDataGeneratingScript.somefunctionyouwrote(). Hope this works!
 X.shape = (97, 2) y.shape = (97, ) theta.shape = (2, ) (X @ theta).shape = (97, ) ((X @ theta) - y).shape = (97, ) X.T.shape = (2, 97) So both method should print a NumPy array of shape (2, ) but the Method 1 fails to produce that whereas Method 2 succeeds. Keep in mind that the code X.T @ ((X @ theta) - y) is equivalent to X.T.dot((X @ theta) - y) and np.dot(X.T, ((X @ theta) - y))
Virtual environments symlink to a Python binary, they don’t include one. If you remove the binary used by the environment, your environment will be broken. You should remove it and make a new one. 
\&gt; Some lesser known facts about python, You may or you may not know. You can't use python to automate shopping for a Macbook. The last time that happened, humanity fell from Eden.
Is it possibly because you defined X twice? first X = data[0] then X = np.column_stack((.....
that works perfect thank you alot!
I wish we could use slice syntax on generators
The `@` operator is equivalent to [matmul](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.matmul.html) not dot product and there are a couple differences in how they handle scalars it looks like.
I just wanted to add a column of ones to the first X initialisation.
Not sure about cron on windows... If you wanted to keep it in the same process, you can try "import time; time.sleep(120)" or something.
What’s with the need people have to constantly regurgitate information already available in the docs? Nobody cares about your “brand”, enough with the fucking blog posts.
It is easier once you get used to it. Just watch for the correct indentation. 
How many ISO documentation have you read. I think "None". That's why there is white paper, that's why there is blog post.
Learn comprehensions (list, dict, set) ASAP. They are a huge key for expressive Python.
Or just use a list.
I also moved from C++ to python like a week ago. The syntax feels weird for 1-2 days but then you feel its a lot better than C++. Correct me if I'm wrong, python is pretty easy compared to C++ right? I've started learning python a week ago and I've been able to create this https://github.com/sggts04/cubetimer It may not be much, but I'm proud
&gt; this is your only real point. I'd like to think my real point was that both types have their strengths and weaknesses, and you should assess your usage of each to suit your business problem :) &gt; You keep mentioning the hashing, but you already know you want them to be frozen, so just mark them as frozen and you get hashing. You may have me confused with another poster, I've only mentioned hashing once. &gt; although for "thousands", lightweight makes no difference. I think if you profile, lightweight is only an issue when you have millions… In the context I'm thinking of, if one operation involves hundreds of thousands of these objects, using that operation in a parallel or concurrent context often means tens/hundreds of millions of objects. At that scale, memory footprint does matter. &gt; Personally, I think of namedtuple as superseded by dataclass. I like to think of them as complements. If you asked me, in the past, developers used namedtuples to solve problems in which dataclasses would be more suitable. As in, namedtuples were chosen in an effort to bypass attribute assignment boilerplate.

How would I use this in the terms of my question?
I'm not sure that's teaching 101. If I'm teaching calculus, I can't assume my students know algebra? I think it all depends on the target audience.
Fair enough. However, I'm a good example. I code on python daily for the past 4 years, however I never needed zip. It may have been a weird situation where I maybe needed it and I coded it differently, but the fact is the same: I didn't know zip.
Oh, I was misreading an example. Thanks.
Isn't this what islice is for? I give you that it isn't in square bracket notation though.
you will have trouble with understanding how for loop works. read this: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp other tips: If you need additional modules use pip to install that. (e.g. pip install numpy) instead of downloading it manually from web like in c++. Use 4 spaces as indentation, it's standard in python and it will make your live easier if you'll need to copy something from stack overflow. and i wouldn't be so harsh about lack of {} in python. it was weird for me to at a beginning, but when I realized that everyone's code look roughly the same like mine, I've loved it. :) 
If you know both C(++) and Python, Nim may be worth checking out. I just learn it for fun in my free time and it may not yet be of use for enterprise solutions, but it definitely is a language with great potential. 
Wrote a tutorial that explains how to [insert values into MySQL using Python](https://datatofish.com/insert-into-mysql-python/).
How do you convert an infinite sequence to a list? 
Yeah it is, still would be more convenient to use square bracket notation :(
This kind of question is better suited to /r/learnpython. The answer is that 'relative weights' means the weights are relative to one another, they don't have to add up to anything in particular. You could turn them into e.g. percentages as `percentages = weights / np.sum(weights) * 100`. Also, when you say "the relative weights are given as something like: [10, 5, 30, 5] which I understand is: [10, 15, 45, 50]", this isn't correct unless you're talking about cumulative weights. `random.choices` supports both options as keyword arguments.
The Anaconda Distribution has Python 3.7 builds for many popular packages.
Polite is better than being a bastard. Zen of python, second amendment 
Let's start with cumulative weights- the second numbers, `[10,15,45,50]`. And let's say our input array is `[0,1,2,3]`. Python is going to make a new array, internally. This new array will have a length of 50. Elements 0-9 will be 0. 10-14 will be 2. And so on. Literally, we have *accumulated* copies of all of the elements in the array. Cumulative weights. You may also specify relative weights. `[10,5,30,5]`, for example. This means we want 10 0s, 5 2s, etc. It says the same thing as above, and in fact, Python implements it exactly the same way- it converts relative weights into cumulative weights and does the same accumulation. NB: I'm eliding lots of details about how the duplication is actually handled, because it's more efficient than this
Look at the process_iter example. Loop through them and the compare the name of each process to the one you’re looking for.
 generator = itertools.count() try again
As others have said, hard to say without an example, but shouldn't take that long. Usually on large data sets, it is key to reduce your data to a sample size when writing/debugging. Then use a profiler (like cprofile) to audit where time is being spent, and refactor to greatness. On a large spreadsheet, I usually load it into a database, and then thread my operations, and do a write back to a fresh spreadsheet. Personal preference though
One of the very good service for streamlining the aws services are step functions. I've done couple of projects where I've invoked step functions using Lambda functions which are triggered using s3 or cloudwatch events. Try that, maybe those could be what you are lukin for.
Okay
If you need to slice an infinite generator, you are no longer dealing with something infinite. Sure, you can make up theoretical examples, but I asked for a real world example.
Basically weights/sum(weights) is the probability of being chosen.
You should look into setuptools and how to package a python application. The ``composer.json`` equivalent in the Python world is ``setup.py``. I suggest to take a look at the ``entry_points`` section of it, it might come in handy.

Dude, use Pandas. It'll save you lots of time and it'll move faster.
Python is a programming language which is completely different from any other programming language and is very easy to learn but hard to master. So if you try write code like you do in C++, Java or any other major programming language for that matter , the code is either going to be super ugly or you are gonna get frustrated by the time you finsish writing it . There is a **Pythonic** way of writing code which my seem strange or weird at first but overtime you will see that it is a very elegant and almost poetic way of writing code. The way basic programming components like for loops are implemented in python is completely different from any major OOP programming language . C++ and Python are 2 completely different beasts which have 2 completely different programming styles so be patient, don't get frustrated and find out why a certain weird language feature is implemented so through Stackoverflow or some other python tutorial site. TL, DR:- * C++ and python are 2 completely different beasts which have 2 completely different programming styles so be patient, don't get frustrated. * There is a **Pythonic** way of writing code which my seem strange or weird at first but overtime you will see that it is a very elegant and almost poetic way of writing code. * Python is a language which is easy to learn but hard to master.
What's your point with uploading existing content onto YouTube? 
It honestly does not sound like an impossible or difficult task. :) Can you give more details? What would the script do? Search base on input, download and upload from your account? 
Search on input yes but also selected videos I upload. It need to download from the account I'm logged into and also for my friends channels. :) 
Ok. What would be your parameters for search? Or are you happy with just searchbar results? So, search on input, download from your account (which will require log in) this will have to be manually for simplicity. 
I'm pretty new to this. Maybe you tuber name, or used words, or views? I can maybe also try searchbar results. 
Please post this in our job sticky
Zip is a built-in. If you can’t assume the built-ins, how can you teach “lesser known things”? 
That as the number of choices increases, dictionary lookup will at some point beat the if/elif chain.
You don't really need WSL unless you're using some oddly specific modules. Most Python stuff runs just fine on native Windows, without the overhead of WSL filesystem translation.
We can experiment (with what I guess you'd call a Monte Carlo simulation), and plot the result: #!/usr/bin/env python3 import random import matplotlib.pyplot values = (1,2,3,4,5) # k is the number of values we generate data = random.choices(values, weights=(1, 2, 1, 0.2, 1), k=500) matplotlib.pyplot.hist(data, len(values)) matplotlib.pyplot.show() Which gives us: https://imgur.com/a/8gF9zE5 Ah, Python, it's like magic without the silly hats.
I tried out the demo code of the gif. I am getting a value error in the line where match = compare_values (known,unknown) It is probably an incorrect dimension of numpy values. I'll upload the code here later. Do the images have to be of some fixed dimension?
I would like a script to download videos from Youtube, maybe some I select myself or just random videos that goes under my conditions. Also, I would like it to reupload everything, and give me the chace to have the same title and my own description as the orginal video. Also, excact same keywords. 
My personal setup is editing on sublime text and running on command line or git bash. But VS gives you the option to code on the IDE.
I use Cmder: https://i.imgur.com/69LjVp9.png
Thanks. Very cool too. I'm still very new to Python and coding, I've got a lot to learn.
Do all python devs have a dartboard with random words on it that they use to name stuff? I feel like there is an XKCD about this somewhere...
So cmder it is. I have it installed just didn’t know that was gonna be my best option. Thanks guys
&gt; Are they a percentage of occurrence? If so why is going over 100% ok? In common usage, weights may not be normalized, and so the specific values don't have a common reference scale (like percentages). "Normalization" gives you what you are looking for; dividing out the total of the relative weights (for example) gives the proportions: `&gt;&gt;&gt; list(numpy.array([10, 5, 30, 5])/sum([10, 5, 30, 5]))` `[0.2, 0.1, 0.6, 0.1]`
recommending r/learnpython for questions
Data is on a website? Is javascript being used? If so, I would use selenium. What format is the data in on the website? is it in html, in a file? It sounds easy to do, possibly time consuming depending on the website you need to scrape. How consistent the data is. You would need regex, BeautifulSoup, Requests, Selenium. Like someone else said, be careful. You could be scraping data you have no access to by accident. 
What profiler are you using?

&gt; it's really opaque to read, but from learning perspective it's better not to give all answers I honestly stopped reading your explanation after this line. Whenever you have to use the word “but” in a sentence where you are defending a point, it’s probably better to rephrase the point that you’re trying to articulate. Also, the goal of this is to help people learn, is it not? Why are you things back that you deem as “answers?” While posts like these can be valuable, they can also be confusing and do more harm than good. 
C++ is hard to learn and requires a master to master. It's questionable if anyone can truly master it. The hardest part of Python is effectively learning the libraries. 
Rabbit is a message queueing system. Celery is a system for feeding jobs to Rabbit. But yes, the name is bad. I’ve had PMs laugh at it in many meetings. 
Nothing, UTF8 is really good. But a general purpose language should be capable of dealing with all encodings and by making a primitive string type UTF8 instead of a string class that is aware of its own encoding makes that problematic.
In general people write a requirements.txt and then do pip install -r requirements.txt You can populate it with your libraries from your virtualenv with pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt If you're reading csv files you might use pandas.read_csv You can also just dump that directly to a database by calling to_sql on it.

If you have input data in (timestamp, conversation id, event) triples like so: (1, "A", "start"), (6, "A", "end"), (2, "B", "start"), (9, "B", "end"), ... and sort them by timestamp, then both questions are pretty easy to answer: data = [(1, "A", "start"), (6, "A", "end"), (2, "B", "start"), (9, "B", "end"), (0, "C", "start"), (3, "C", "end"), (4, "D", "start"), (5, "D", "end")] def print_max_concurrent(data): active = set() max_start = 0 max_end = 0 max_cids = set() for timestamp, cid, event in sorted(data): if event == "start": # Add conversation to the pool of currently active conversations active.add(cid) # If the pool size is larger than previous max, take note if len(active) &gt; len(max_cids): max_cids = set(active) max_start = timestamp elif event == "end": if active == max_cids: max_end = timestamp active.remove(cid) formatted_cids = ", ".join(sorted(max_cids)) print("From timestamp %d to %d, %d conversations %s were in progress." % (max_start, max_end, len(max_cids), formatted_cids)) def print_in_progress(data, target_timestamp): active = set() for timestamp, cid, event in sorted(data): if event == "start": active.add(cid) elif event == "end": if timestamp &gt; target_timestamp: break active.remove(cid) formatted_active = ", ".join(sorted(active)) print("Conversations in progress at %d: %s" % (target_timestamp, formatted_active)) print_max_concurrent(data) print_in_progress(data, 6) This is just a quick stab and does not deal with corner cases. And only tested with your sample questions ;-) 35000 conversations should be no problem.
I guess I'm still confused. Are you sure you don't mean UTF-32? That is the encoding that strings are using "under the hood" in Python 3, in an implicit sense. Maybe you are confusing strings with bytes? Bytes aren't aware of their own encoding. I personally find that if I am receiving bytes of an unknown encoding, it is okay to assume UTF-8, and to fall back on Latin-1 if UnicodeDecodeError is encountered. This seems to work in 99% of cases. For the other 1% of the time, your problem is probably not Python-related anyways (e.g. processing a large amount of poorly documented unorganized data, which is a hard problem in any language).
Python is "helping" you. When you call an import for a second time, python knows it's already imported and ignores the import. For example this program only runs "mm.py" once: from mm import mainMenu001 # runs the code in mm from mm import mainMenu001 # this line is ignored You need to move the code in mm.py into functions. Then use an import at the top of your code, and call the functions, not the import, to run the code. Try /r/learnpython for more help. Show them all the code you have and describe where you are stuck. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
I use miniconda with VS Code at work and I recommend it.
just started learning python done with introduction and some simple programs .
Yup. This seems like a textbook use case for a time series index. That way you can use the granularity you want and just have a boolean column for each observation (e.g. is present at this time or not). https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/timeseries.html
No powershell ?
Maybe a real world example would explain it best. I have to collect addresses and later send them to other services. The services I send them to only accepts certain encodings. One accepts latin1, another one excepts ascii and so on. I am allowed to do simple transliterations, so for example "í" may be replaced with "i" in the case of latin1 and "ö" may be replaced with "oe" in ascii. But there's an abundance of Unicode characters that simply cannot be transliterated. By the time I actually send these addresses to the third party systems I can no longer notify the user that provided these addresses that they are invalid. In python this is error prone, basically I have to verify the result of every single string operation. If the string itself didn't allow characters that were invalid for its encoding this would not have been the case.
# For example, the below prints 2. # Seriously, use pandas. You'll be glad you did. import pandas as pd ix = pd.DatetimeIndex(start='2018-01-01', end='2018-12-31', freq='D') df = pd.DataFrame(index=ix) fill_dict = { 'event_1': ('2018-05-01', '2018-05-30'), 'event_2': ('2018-05-05', '2018-05-25'), 'event_3': ('2018-05-05', '2018-05-06'), } for name, date_range in fill_dict.items(): df.loc[date_range[0]: date_range[1], name] = True df[name] = df[name].fillna(False) count_of_events_2018_05_15 = df.loc['2018-05-15'].value_counts()[True] count_of_events_2018_05_15

I’ll have to take a look at conda. I haven’t used it so I’ll research. Do you ever have issues developing on Windows with it and the running the code on Linux?
What encoding are you accepting the addresses in? I assume it is something that is able to represent all Unicode codepoints, based on what you wrote. Also, are you expected to handle all possible inputs? Are you allowed to reject inputs based on some predefined criteria? I feel like in this kind of situation, I would rely on a third-party package for transliteration (rather than reinvent the wheel), and I would reject addresses that don't fit the 90% use case. But I only have 2 years of Python experience, so I may be overlooking some detail that makes this job much nastier than it seems.
I accept it in UTF8. I think you're missing my point. I don't want a solution, I already have a solution(which is a lot of defensive code and tests). The thing is that anyone who doesn't believe that every encoding is a different type, think that UTF8 fits all or thinks that you can just encoding/decode on input/output has _not_ worked enough in environments where multiple encodings exists and has to be dealt with. For a general purpose language making the default string encoding UTF8 is kind-of-acceptable but it's far from good and it shows a lack of understanding of what a large part of the world has to deal with. Old systems doesn't just go away like that. 
I have used it only for short scripts. To use them in a Linux VM I only add #!/usr/bin/env python at the top of the file.
Alright, I guess I can accept that. There should really be multiple types rather than a single "bytes" type. But does this problem go away in Python 2? Without the defensive code and tests, I can guarantee that your system would fail silently somewhere.

&gt; I currently don't know in which OS my project will be deployed but how would I go about doing that? Zip the files and sftp them and ask my client to install python 3.5? If you want to avoid the hassle of having your clients install Python (and hence depending on the path to be configured properly, with no conflicting versions of Python), you might want to look into a portable installation of Python. For example, you could include Miniconda in your zip file, and treat it as if it were a self-contained virtual environment. However, then you run into the problem of need multiple solutions for different OS's and architectures. If you have no qualms about making your clients install Python, then make sure to rigorously test your code across different versions of Python. It is common to specify the minimum supported version, such as Python 3.3+ or Python 3.4+. You would then need to make sure that any third party libraries you are using can satisfy their own version requirements. Typically you provide your own requirements.txt to avoid dependency hell, but then you better hope that e.g. your client doesn't need requests=v2.3.1 in their system install of Python while your own project needs requests=v2.5.2. Sometimes this dependency hell can happen within a single project, so make sure to use a tool like Pip-conflict-checker, and verify that there are no conflicts across any versions of Python you plan to support.

My intuition is that zip longest means that zip is actually zip shortest, which while correct, should be explicit. This does go to the point about who this is aimed at. If this is aimed at a beginner, zip should be introduced. If this is aimed at someone more advanced, we should get more info about specifics, like zip creates a new list, while izip is just an iterator, does zip_longest return a list or iterator? I maintain this is a bad article for nearly all target audiences.
Thank you ;)
I mean, itertools and collections are default libraries. Why is there a blog post rehashing them but worse
Web scraping in general is relatively simple, but it may be more difficult depending on the format of the website. As for writing to a word doc, that’s pretty easy if you install python-docx library
There's no `izip` in Python 3. It was essentially renamed `zip`.
Just made this today! Python is my first programming language and I'm really enjoying the learning process. Have a nice day, guys!

Ok I did it, it's much faster, the line in the loop becomes: out.append(''.join(("\x1B[38;2;", ';'.join(map(str,top_pxl[::-1])),"m\x1B[48;2;", ';'.join(map(str,bot_pxl[::-1])), "m▀\x1B[0m"))) And you get this sort of output: https://puu.sh/Bdip5/5035285e22.png
What's it made from? (so I could make my own) Glad you like python. It's pretty fun
More like Pythoner.
Python2 strings were rebranded as "bytes" objects in python3. Python2 "unicode" objects were renamed to "str" in python3. In addition, the python3 json module also changed to only allow "str" (formerly unicode) objects. I'm sure there's a reason for that, but I don't know it. The end result is that you have to deal with converting in python3, but not in python2. Unrelated, but why would you strip the "=" from base64 output? Those are there for a reason.

I'm pretty sure the Python 3 `json.loads` accepts bytes too. I think the first `.decode()` is superfluous.
 &gt;&gt;&gt; import json &gt;&gt;&gt; json.loads(b'"hello world"') 'hello world' Huh, would ya look at that. Thanks for the correction. 
Thank you and I will make sure to post in r/learnpython next time. As I said I am new to this but my understanding is that you strip out the "=" because python uses them to pad to make the math easy for base 64 but not all languages do, at least in the output. Since JWTs are used for authentication they have to match exactly so if one signature has an extra couple "=" at the end versus another they won't authenticate. The end result is that you strip out padding before transmitting so that everyone is sending the same thing. 
Beautiful! Well, the output, not that frightening one-liner 😉
The [output padding is part of the base64 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64#Output_padding), but some quick googling tells me that some places omit it, which is news to me. TIL.
PEP 8 violation
Hey look, it's me! Would love to have one of these, time to bust out the old beads.
Yeah I don't know. I just know the accepted JWT "standard" is to omit padding. 
Hey, thanks a bunch, this is really simple and elegant.
This wouldn't be specific to Anaconda. But, the general problems of Python + trying to be cross-platform will eventually surface. You cannot avoid that. You would run into some problems with Anaconda if your code relied on `setuptools` to put it in specific directories -- that might not work because things like `sys.prefix` will be in places you would not have anticipated. So, better avoid using `pkg_resources` (it's best to avoid it anyways), if you are going to use Anaconda, and try to use `conda` for thing you'd use `pip` and `virtualenv` for.
I'm glad to hear you're enjoying the learning process! I've been trying to help some people along in learning python as their first programming language, and I'm finding that what worked for me, doesn't seem to be working as well for them. What kind of things did you do to start learning?
Kudos to them. I ran into the problem I've described just a few days ago when trying to install `PyWavelet`, which is a dependency of `scikit-image`. I then talked to the maintainers, and they told me they are planning 3.7 support in the next month or so.
What HTTP library are you using and what is the OS where Python script is executed? Have you tried `Tornado` HTTP client or `aiohttp`?
Nice. I'd like to have it, too.
(PyCharm Developer Advocate here.) It's true that Python allows some constructs that make it hard for PyCharm to guess, and thus PyCharm misfires. Type hints in dependencies would help in those cases. Hopefully the vast majority of the time, PyCharm's warnings/errors are accurate and helpful.
(PyCharm Developer Advocate.) If you can work with me on an example, I can make a feature request.
Just to be clear, you are storing the values in "phone" as an integer, as opposed to a string, or tuple, or other type? That's slightly odd, because phone numbers, generally, are not really integers. Ask yourself, what would happen if a phone number started with one or more zeros... There are phone number prefixes of both 0, and 00, used in international calling, for example. That said, to answer your question as asked, you'd likely convert the int to a string, and then you'd build a new string with the dashes included, probably using slices.: `phone_str = str(phone)` `assert len(phone_str) == 10` `dashed_phone_str = phone_str[:3] + '-' + phone_str[3:6] + '-' + phone_str[6:]` Note, this way of doing it is \*very\* error prone and fragile, without some extra validation, unless you know you'll always get 10 digit phone numbers, etc. More likely, you'll want to store phone numbers in a data structure (maybe a length 3 tuple, for each section, or even a NamedTuple). Better yet, a class that understand how to print the phone number when printed as a string, which could handle international numbers, extensions, prefixes, etc. Hopefully this gets you started. At the very least, store them as strings, not integers.
Vprof I think it's called, as well as standard Python profiler. 
A really simple solution would be to create a small helper function that formats and returns the phone number string: def format_phone(phone_in): return ‘_’.join(phone_in[0:3], phone_in[3:6], phone_in[6:]) And then call that function in your print statement.
You could use something as simple as: def format_phone_num(phone_number: str) -&gt; str: return '-'.join([a[:3], a[3:6], a[6::]]) There might be a more efficient way though! :)
That makes a lot of sense. I'm just getting started with Python and this was given as a practice exercise. I'm guessing the lesson was probably about converting to strings and using the format method. Is that assert line to handle the leading 0's?
I think using a function is probably the best way to accomplish this (if phone is stored as an int instead of str). Just curious, can that join be done in the print statement?
&gt;this was given as a practice exercise. My answer presumes you've learned about slices? That's more advanced than just converting numbers to strings... They may be expecting you to manipulate the number mathematically to get the various sections. It's a bit of a weird example for them to setup the phone number as an integer, imo. &gt;Is that assert line to handle the leading 0's? Or really just any unexpected length of phone number; the idea for the assert is that the program should basically abort if such a fundamentally unexpected result is found in the program logic. For example the number might not include the area code, which my version doesn't handle. There are simple loop methods that are more robust. This is more of an /r/learnpython question, make sure you look in that subreddit (and check the sidebar of this one).

Now you're catching on. ;)
Thank you very much for the help! I learned something new about Python and reddit. Didn't know about the info in the sidebar there. I think my eyes are trained to just avoid that area, since it's usually ads on every site :).
They've just done a fairly big update to Reddit which has changed the sidebars somewhat; but yeah, it's useful to check, they often have a treasure trove of info.

Hell no
I can't be sure, but it looks like you're not reading the sidebar.
I wrote something similar (though less generic!) years ago. My approach was to have the decorator re-write the function's AST to replace any direct recursive calls with looping. [1]: https://github.com/Bogdanp/tcopy/tree/master/tcopy 
Thank for the reply! I get the first error again... Runtime error Unable to open C:... Failed to execute script It's like it doesnt recognize shape\_predictor\_68\_face\_landmarks.dat 
AFAICT, it is a true JVM. It needs a more complete runtime library to run anything more than toy Java programs. It is VERY slow. But it is a true JVM.

That's actually what I originally wanted but I think making it any smaller than that would be a bit of a challenge. Since I couldn't get my keychain I'm gonna hang this one on my rear view mirror.
It wasn't very hard to make! Perler beads are ridiculously cheap and very entertaining. Give it a try :)
Haha, my first beetlejuicing experience!
Yes, they are Perler beads. Very cheap and very easy to start making things with them, I actually just started recently myself.

Its easier to understand true tail call optimization, which you can apply here to OPs implementation. Terms: Tail call: When a function return nothing but itself called with different arguments. def factorial(n): if n &lt;= 1: return 1 # Not a tail call return factorial(n-1) # A tail call Stack Frame: This is kind of complicated but in a sense its basically a context with some local variables and global variables, you need memory for these local variables which gets stored on the "stack" and the globals are somewhere else. Now why we have a recursion depth limit is because you need memory to create stack frames and you don't have infinite memory. But theres a fancy optimization you can do when a function makes a tail call. Because your function is calling itself and doesn't need any more memory or use of its local variables, instead of making a new stack frame you can just reuse the current one. Just calculate and set the arguments (the arguments/parameters are just local variables) and jump to the start of the function code. Now you can't exactly do that in Python, but you can optimize in a similar way by modifying you function so your tail calls don't full evaluate and instead return an instance of an object (called a trampoline but is also known as a partial in functools library) which when you call evaluates the function. The magic is that you can then wrap the entire function, so that when it is called if it tries to return a trampoline(0) you can then call that trampoline(0). So far this doesn't seem helpful but the stack saving is that if that trampoline(0) returns (remember - it actually fully returned, that stackframe is deleted) another trampoline(1) you can save some memory by overwriting the last trampoline(0) and calling trampoline(1). If trampoline(1) returns a trampoline(2) you can again overwrite trampoline(1) with trampoline(2) and keep calling until you get something that isn't a trampoline. It might take a while to wrap your head around it, because its a couple layers deep in meta, but its not that bad. 
try to use regex magic, like splitting by "dot not followed by a number" or something: `\.(?!\d)` https://regular-expressions.mobi/lookaround.html
Thanks 
How does it stack against - for example - ptpython?
You can use any beginner tutorial, like http://www.diveintopython3.net/.
As a teacher, I've come to realise that the main mistake people do when trying to educate others, is failing to prepare for the learners level of prerequisite knowledge. Although you can never make something that's for both beginners and advanced learners, it's strangely a bit of a fine balance, as the more fine-tuned a material you make, the larger the cohort of learners (who would benefit the most from your material) you exclude. That's why, sometimes, you just have to go over some basic stuff again and never, EVER take for granted, the learners expertise, or "expertise". Other than that, I think it's a great job!!! (and even helped me brush up on decorators a little, too) :)

not sure if that's what you're looking for but look at [intake](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/intake) (recently released), but if you want some caching, I don't know of any generic solution (not surprising, the number of combination between source type and relevant cache storage choice for each is large and complex)
Use eel or if you know django then go for django-eel or electon with django server, I find these as having a modern feel and easy since they use the basic html and css to bundle python scripts
JWT stands for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token
**JSON Web Token** JSON Web Token (JWT, sometimes pronounced ) is a JSON-based open standard (RFC 7519) for creating access tokens that assert some number of claims. For example, a server could generate a token that has the claim "logged in as admin" and provide that to a client. The client could then use that token to prove that it is logged in as admin. The tokens are signed by one party's private key (usually the server's), so that both parties (the other already being, by some suitable and trustworthy means, in possession of the corresponding public key) are able to verify that the token is legitimate. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
It’s logical. When loading, you follow the JSON standard, which is UTF8. When dumping, it’s not clear what the byte string is supposed to represent: could be UTF8 or 16 or some random other encoding.

i kind of did this but it did not work. df1.str.replace('$M\\d.\\d$','Mirror')
string replace doesn't work with regex, and the regex itself is wrong (`$` is an anchor for the line end, for example)

So as an Update I removed -F from the arguments. The error changed to "Unable to open "...\\dist\\CapData\\face\_recognition\_models\\models\\shape\_predictor\_68\_face\_landmarks.dat" . So I copy paste the face\_recognition\_models folder to dist\\CapData. Then I got an error saying "`this application failed to start because it could not find or load the qt platform plugin windows`". I updated PyQt. Now it runs!!! But I still have to find how can I do it in one file with `-F`
I prefer melting both sides. It's a bit weaker when you only melt one side.
Is Python made of Perl?
Depends on the scope, really. Is this something distributed and interacts with the user's system heavily, or centralized and interacts with user's input. (First is client gui, second would be web server, in most cases)
I didn’t know about that. After a few minutes testing it, I’d say bpython is much lighter and the autocomplete is more responsive and expressive. 
You should ask yourself "Should multiple users be able to reach/modify the same data while using my software?" If your answer is "yes", then you should do some web development for sure. Otherwise, use PyQt.

I counted at least 3 goofy statements in that comment. Don't lie to folks with legitimate questions. What works for you may not work for the majority of people. At least point THAT out.
Hey folks, just published this simple tool, I usually find myself with a lot of ugly code using argparse, or I don't know where to put stuff, so I wrote this simple wrapper around it. I would like to hear some feedback. Thanks!

C, if I recall correctly.
we're not into this kind of things
I’m using the package Requests (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master) that appears to be based on urllib3 and both systems are Windows 10 (build 1607). I’m waiting on approval for the Pro version of Pycharm so I can run the profiler on my code, but in the mean time I ran it with Sysinternal’s Process Monitor and one thing that stood out is that every single REST query is opening c:\Program Files\Python36\Lib\site-packages\certifi\cacert.pem. The code for the query is just a single line: Response = request.get(url, auth=(user, pwd)) So not sure if there is a way to keep the connection open for the next X queries like you would with an SQL server, but I wonder if opening that .pem file (I assume to verify the ssl cert on the server) repeatedly from the disk is part of the problem. 
ptpython is heavier than bpython. I tried both and sometimes ptpython is dead with no response from my server.
Thanks! 😎👍

You're awesome. I'll see if I can come up with one. It would be great to be able to use dictionaries instead of always having to bust out classes or `typing.NamedTuple`.
Why not click? :) 
For our GUI product we used cefpython. I was able to write a glue layer between javascript variables and python class variables. The result was AngularJS views controlled by Python controllers, pretty slick. Then when it comes time to move the product to the cloud, most of the work is already done.
Do you mean it will prevent him from learning the basics? Can you be specific?
I am not a big fan of click, I don't like having decorators everywhere, or creating an empty function for a group. docopt and cleo, I find them confusing, and I feel like I can easily make a typo and forget about it. My approach is usually using argparse, which I'm already familiar with, because there's also no dependency added, but after some coding, I realize I'm creating a mess. This is a tiny library which assists me in using argparse, of course, the trade off is a new dependency (but small). 
Very cool! Ideas like this are great for people like me who don't have an extensive background in OOP for CLI usage.
What kind of proxy are you talking about? Http?
The powerful autocomplete any type checking features of IDLE causes a new programmer to take longer to develop programming practices that cause them to check that stuff themselves. While it is simply an annoyance for a more experienced programmer to have to do checking that can simply be done by the IDE I believe it is valuable for a new developer to struggle with that for some time. It follows the mindset that learning something the hard way initially pays dividends in the end game.
Might be boring but the MNIST handwritten digit classification problem is v common for starters in AI. Though, starting in Python and AI might not always be the best idea! 
Discussion on Hacker News: [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17731321](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17731321)
then how about a python project idea that is quite advance 
You could make an AI for digit classification inside images or classifying anything in general, that's usually not so hard if your training data set is big enough. Although I am not sure if a beginner should already mess with stuff like AI because it can get really complex.
okay then what are good long term projects for beginners
That actually is a pretty advanced project. What I mean by boring is that it's very common to do, but it's by no means trivial. Here's an article about the process: [https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.0/get\_started/mnist/beginners](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.0/get_started/mnist/beginners)
no I mean without an AI cos I don't need to make something with an AI just something complex but a beginner could do

Oh I see, perhaps look into making a simple local website with flask? Or perhaps a simple GUI with tkinter? Those are advanced but in grasp for a beginner
My advice to you is to be very careful to avoid writing Java in Python. Static types and the approaches that static types foster are appropriate in Java, and the tooling is strongly in support of that approach. Python is a different language, and the tradeoffs are different. You need to learn not only the syntax of python, but also the "pythonic" way of writing code and thinking about problems. As an example, you normally write getters and setters in java. In python, you set things directly. If you later need the extra functionality that getters and setters offer, you would use magic methods to implement that functionality. Why? Both methods would work, but the latter is in good alignment with the structure and nature of the language you are working in. People who use python will expect certain things, and doing things in those ways makes it easier for others to understand your code. Learning to by pythonic is difficult when coming from a statically typed language like java, but is well worth it if you want your code to be readable and maintainable over an extended time period.
OK, so could I make it so that if this number, this timestamp, is a certain number it will kill the program? And if so, how? How would I check if the program has been running for an hour?
It seems like you mean HTTP/SOCKS proxies if you're saying you want to 'mask a connection', but I think there are two things you're assuming that aren't correct if so: * That each computer needs a distinct proxy * That creating proxies is purely a matter of software A single proxy service an work for multiple computers simultaneously, you don't need one per computer. More than that, though, is the fact that running a proxy on your own computer won't, as you say, 'mask a connection'. If your goal is to use a proxy to prevent a 3rd party knowing what your IP address is running a local proxy will do nothing useful for you. You need a machine running a proxy service with other IP addresses to use so that your own IP never gets revealed to whatever your'e connecting to on the other side of the proxy.
Programming can be vastly different for games, web apps, or other stuff like machine learning. Pick a direction you are interested in pursuing and google for project ideas (e.g. "project idea for python games"). Also there's a sub for programming project ideas, but I forgot the link.
I created a cli tool that makes my life easier when using argparse :) https://github.com/Woile/decli 
You can call `kill` on the `Process` object to kill a process. To check the time it has been running for, take the current time and subtract the start time of the process.

I’m not sure of what he wants is illegal but he used computers to purchase hyped shoes and needs a lot of proxies to mask the connection coming from a single address while attempting to visit the site cuz the sneaker sites try to prevent people from running bots and such.

What sort of information are you trying to fetch from that?
So yes, he's trying to get around something a different service not only asks you not to do in their TOS (I'm presuming) but even actively tries to stop you doing. Again, ask yourself if you think this sounds like the practice of a good business. &gt; Lots of people sell data center proxies and things like that but they’re not the most reliable and he’s wanting to see if he can just generate it in house somehow In a word: no. In a few more words: technically it can be done, but not with purely software and not for free. IP addresses aren't something you can pull out of a hat, you need (for any practical intents and purposes) to get them allocated to you in some way by an ISP or cloud provider like AWS or DigitalOcean.

But how would I keep this running in the background?
You can use `time.sleep` to calculate how long you need to wait for before killing the process. If you need to do it repeatedly, you can use a `while` loop.
There’s a cool new simple game library called pyxel that you should check out. I just implemented snake with it and found it very rewarding. 
Perhaps look at some open source python projects/libraries you like and see if you are able to contribute? Have a look at their issue tracker (if they have it) and see if you can help solve an issue! This might prove very rewarding

Sooo, I transitioned from bash to Python. When I say bash, I *mean bash*. I wrote a 4K line bash script and then cried horribly at the debugging mess I had created. Associative arrays, ghetto-ass process pools, the works. So Python was great, in that it had types besides string (bash is *stringly-typed*), lists that didn't suck, other datastructures in general, and OOP. Python is really quite a strict language when compared with bash. It was all really confusing at first, but the community was great and I'm now the Python expert at my job. The thing that I had the hardest time with was file IO. In Bash, here's how you write to a file: echo 'This is a foo bar' &gt; /tmp/file.txt Versus the dumb way to do it in Python: opened_file = open('/tmp/file.txt', mode='w') # Hope you didn't forget the mode! mode.write('This is a foo bar\n') # No implicit newline! mode.close() # Hope you didn't forget to close the file! I *hated* this when I first started. It seemed so stupidly verbose compared to bash. I've come to understand that it's a much better approach, but it also helped when I learned how to do it this way: with open('/tmp/file.txt', mode='w') as fd: fd.write('This is a foo bar\n') And then eventually with `pathlib`: from pathlib import Path Path('/tmp/file.txt').write_text('This is a foo bar\n') My recommendation to you is the same as what /u/jricher42 said. Learn how to write Python the way the creators of the language intended. *Don't* use setters and getters. Use properties if direct attribute access won't work. Properties are great! Embrace duck typing because it's friggin awesome! Everything is mutable (except for when it explicitly isn't) and you're free to modify objects, functions, and classes at any time for any reason. Hell, being able to modify a class at runtime makes singletons super easy. Keep up using static type hinting! It's really good enough for most cases. I use it religiously (`typing.NamedTuple` is like crack for me) and almost never have type issues. Another recommendation I have is to avoid handling as many errors as you possibly can. IMO, Python programs work best when they can fail loudly and spectacularly! You want obvious issues (Hindenburg), not subtle issues. If your program crashes and spits out an ugly, scary traceback (which are excellent in Python) then you're more likely to get it from your user and you'll be more able to fix the bug. My programs rarely crash once they're in production because I make QA's job easy and we track down a ton of bugs. Finally, try to do more with less, but don't code golf. List and dictionary comprehensions reduce line count and increase readability as long as they're relatively short. `map` and `filter` are dope and get rid of a bunch of noise. As long as your variable names are correctly descriptive, you can usually do things in a more terse fashion and actually increase readability. Brevity is the soul of wit!

I couldn't say it better. I actually did what the OP wants, an accounting application for myself (well, at this point is more of an ERP with invoicing, billing, budgets, accounting, clients, providers, reports, dinamic pdf-creation, pricing calculators, inventory and way more stuff xD). But to the point: I did it to myself so I just use PySide2 and SQLite. If I would want this to be for multiple users at the same time I would had chosen web development.

What is your end goal? It seems to me like it's "get thing done with Python", not "learn enough Python to get thing done". If that's the case, what's the thing? 
Do you spin up threads once and then use them in a pool? Or are you constantly creating and destroying threads? I don't know how many inboxes you're dealing with, but even an hour seems like a pretty long depending on how hard you can hit the API. I would expect something like this to take ~15 minutes at the most unless the number of inboxes is in the millions or the API is very slow to respond. I'd honestly recommend using `aiohttp` if you have access to Python &gt;= 3.5. Threading is such a heavy-handed way to go about this type of task. `aiohttp` relies on `asyncio` which uses a single thread in an extremely efficient way, since most of the time you're just waiting on the network to give information back to you. You can have thousands of requests active and not hit your head on CPU. I think my record was ~40gb/s for bandwidth and 300K requests per second. The biggest thing to keep in mind is that since you're only running on one thread, anything that blocks for a long time is going to block your entire application. That means that you should use `aiofiles` for disk writing, and a combination of `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` and `loop.run_in_executor` to run slow/blocking code (like if you need to shell out using `subprocess.run`). It's pretty difficult to grok at first, but once you get the hang of it, things become really easy.

The name is going to be so confusing. I though this was about PyCharm IDE.
&gt; A novice might find that an easier solution I think many experts would as well :P. &gt; It uses oauth2 which is better than storing your credentials in plain text, Google provides single use credentials for IMAP. I can't think how this is particularly different as far as security goes from using oauth, unless oauth provides more fine grained permissions. &gt; It might seem daunting to get into the API Or like a non-optimal use of time. &gt; e.g. reading/modifying labels and an easy way to query and manage search results. This reason is potentially valid for the OP and might be a compelling use case for using the API. Let me offer some reasons to *not* use the API. * Easier to switch away from google. * Potentially better tooling and an ecosystem of tools * Tools like `imapsync` can be used combined with local indexing software like `notmuch` for rapid search and these tools can be patched if found insufficient. 
Not generally asynchronous.
Not super new, but, yeah, definitely asynchronous.
First look: "Ugh, whitespace as a delimiter? WTF? But it seems kinda neat otherwise..." Then I put it down for a year or two. One day I decided to solve the Python Challenge ( http://www.pythonchallenge.com/ ). In Ada. It took me a week, but I did. Then I started reading things about it, and some people were claiming that they solved it IN ONE DAY, in Python. So, I decided to try Python again. That was nearly 10 years ago and I've been using it constantly since. But the whitespace thing still sucks. 
&gt;Vprof Nice, I'm using cprofile and snakeviz. I'm trying to speed up [meld](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/meld/merge_requests/18) dir diff but since the biggest problem is Disk IO, most of options would help. Multiprocessing helped in SSD but not in HDD, maybe it better fits your case.
What do you mean?
&gt; email['payload']['parts'][#part_id]['body']['data'] Ok with this I can get the base64, but I still have the encoding problem. I've used base64.b64decode() to translate the base64 to bytes, and then used decode('utf-8'). If I use it that way it gives me error on a character, I can get it to work with the option "error = ignore" but the output is something corrupt like: &lt;!doctype htmlB�[��H������˝�˛ܙ��NNNK��[�Ν�H�\�����[X\�[ZXܛ��ٝ X��N���[�Λ�H�\�����[X\�[ZXܛ��ٝ X��N�ٙ�X�N�ٙ�X�H�УƆVC�Т�F�F�S���F�F�P4(������m�����ͽt&lt;!-- --&gt;

Well, since you asked... I wanted to create a program that will see how long a program has been running and if it's been running for more than an hour, it will kill the program because 'I' have been using it for too long. psutil is a great module, but it doesn't have detailed documentation on this sort of use, so I turned to the almighty Reddit pythoners!.. is that a word.. whatever.
But then how would they spend all their time reinventing the wheel for their specific needs? 😁

Oh well, I posted here because I saw a similar post on /r/python in the past with very helpful mod responses. Guess not!
Whoa! Hey!
no, it's a noob bitching
If I think of Django as "it works if you do it our way," and Flask as "this doesn't do anything for you configure it all however you want". Also, we regularly discuss this topic at /r/flask so I've parroted this a few times. Most people should stick with Django for just doing stuff, but Flask can be slimmer and simpler if your needs smaller than Django's baseline.
"its the equipment, not me" /s It's always something I f-ed up
I think that is the point of the gif, cartman is blaming the cat for something it can't be responsible for breaking. If it stopped working you did something to make it stop working. 
I’m not familiar with this specific episode, so I don’t know what the context is of Cartman yelling at his cat. 
yup, exactly
That's frightening, and I've programmed in COBOL.
I don't member it either, but that is what cartman would do. If I were to guess the cat has more followers than him on facebook or something. 
Congrats to the author for making Python totally unPythonic.
Yep, that's it.
Never heard of Quart. It's vibora I was thinking of.
It's vibora.
Noobs tend to (incorrectly) blame their tools first: "It didn't compile because there must be a bug in gcc."
Have you tried plumbum? 
I may be wrong but would you not be able to use virtualenv vagrant or even docker to kind of solidify the libraries and version of python you are using in order to avoid such problems? I guess of the 3, virtual env is the most resource efficient and easy to setup and use. Once you set it up you will have the same libraries working all the time so it is only the python code itself that can break. The other 2 ( vagrant/ docker) should guarantee that even the system itself is the same. I may be wrong with this but if i was in doubt of the code breaking because of python I would use virtual env. 
Well, it depends on what the gif is supposed to be saying. I originally took it to mean that Python 3.6, specifically, is causing a person's code to work sometimes and not others. So virtual environments wouldn't really solve that. Although it sounds like, from other comments, that what OP meant was that they had written some bad code and the joke is about blaming Python 3.6 as the culprit for that odd behaviour.
Yea, I got that it is a joke of blaming the system for bad code. Also yea, virtual env would not help if python itself is the problem (even if the chance of this happening is 0,000000001%). 
Just add it to the pile of PyPy/PyPI and CPython/Cython. Nothing new for this language.
To be fair, I wrote a discord bot, and it was working perfectly fine, but suddenly it started throwing out these errors. It took me three weeks to make the connection that it was just after joining a new server and the way they had set up the perms was breaking this particular feature. Nothing *horrible*, he bit still ran just fine, but it for once *wasn’t* my fault.
Being able to use react is a good reason to use web technologies for UI design. I wish there were a Python equivalent of react/redux for desktop UI development. 
A waste of time. Look at [any Django vs Flask](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/7zxqln/should_i_learn_flask_first_or_django/) thread and everyone notes that as their project grew they wish they had used Django instead. [Greenspun's tenth rule states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule)) that "Any sufficiently complicated Flask app ad-hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Django."
So it didn't happen then.
Would love if you could share some more about this. 
Did you read the top comment? &gt;Django. &gt; &gt;A lot of beginers make the mistake of starting with flask first, because it's way easier to make a "hello world". &gt; &gt;But the fact is, doing **correctly** anything more than a small website with flask requires expert skills because you have to take a lot of design decisions. And when you learn programming, designing a system is far, far away from what you can do. &gt; &gt;I encounter every year flask code bases that have terrible flaws (md5 hashed passwords, no escaped variables, aweful session management, no plugability, big monolithic chunks, etc) because the dev hacked his way through the project with no clue of the consequences of his or her choices. &gt; &gt;It will also give you terrible example on how to organise code. The global requests object, the dichotomy of the central app vs blueprints, the inconsistant way to handle third party code... Those are artefacts of early decisions that, without the contextual explanation of experience, will lead you to believe they are correct practices in any cases. &gt; &gt;On the other hand, django first steps will be harder. &gt; &gt;But out of the box it gives you a sane project structures, prevents CSRF and clickjacking, feature authentifications from a to z, and so on. You won't have to choose an admin lib, a form lib, an ORM lib and how to integrate them. You just do what Django tells you do to. Basically it will force you to make things ok, even if you understand jack about it.
snakeviz + cprofile =)
Instead of using the Activate script for the virtual environment, once you have it set up, you can run the Python: Create Terminal command that will open a new terminal with the virtual environment already activated. This is better for me as I like to keep my virtual environments separate from my project folders.
Personally, if my needs grow beyond flask, then I don't use python at all. The idea of implementing a large scale web application in a duck typed language seems insane to me. But if I just need a microservice, flask is perfect. So I don't think this is a universal statement.
You mean a text widget? All GUI libraries have a multiline text widget. Any other requirements? 
Not really per say thanks 
&gt;Personally, if my needs grow beyond flask, then I don't use python at all. The idea of implementing a large scale web application in a duck typed language seems insane to me. Do you mean dynamically typed? And why? Most websites are built with high-level languages because the usual reasons for low-level languages such as speed and portability don't apply because of the client-server model of web apps and web servers. &gt;But if I just need a microservice, flask is perfect. So I don't think this is a universal statement. Why? `django-admin startproject myproject` boom done and easy with all the things you should be putting in an app anyway.

Obviously f-strings are a good thing. Also a big fan of pathlib.

There is nothing unpythonic about documenting a feature of python. Dont blame the author for creating optional types...wtf
Hard to say but.i bet you want something like a Jupyter notebook 
Extremely easy multiprocessing (for real!) via [concurrent.futures](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#module-concurrent.futures).
&gt; Dont blame the author Agreed! Actually thank him for bringing this unpythonic syntax to our attention. Maybe a bit to late, because I believe these things is set in stone. But I would love someone showing how static type checking is pythonic? 
&gt; - Explicit is better than implicit &gt; - ... practicality beats purity. Static typing helps make your code more resilient, refactoring less stressful, and code more readable (you may disagree with this, but once you get used to it, it helps out immensely). 
You know gitlab has a cloud solution that runs on their gitlab software you're deriding. Oh, have you also heard of a little company called GitHub [which also runs as a rails app](https://blog.github.com/2009-10-20-how-we-made-github-fast/). Reddit is in Python, is that high traffic enough for you? Here's [37 high traffic sites in rails](https://skillcrush.com/2015/02/02/37-rails-sites/) including Github, AirBnb, Hulu, Twitch, Square, ZenDesk, KickStarter, Groupon, Fiverr, Bloomberg, Basecamp. [Famous Django sites include](https://www.bedjango.com/blog/top-5-sites-built-django-framework/) Instagram, Disqus, Pinterest, Butbucket, NASA.gov . So like literally you haven't even looked into this before
Afaik you can raise whatever you want. That said you might instead consider instantiating the ValueError with a message, having one except block and branching based on the message: Try: .... Raise ValueError("Type 1") .... Raise ValueError("Type 2") Except ValueError as e: If e.msg == "Type 1": .... If e.msg == "Type 2": ....
Don't reuse the builtin Exceptions, make your own that are specific to whatever is happening. Then you don't need to bother catching anything, just let the Exception do the work. class TempTooHighError(Exception): pass class UserTooHighError(Exception): pass if 'hot': raise TempTooHighError('ouch!') --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
This is probably a pretty unsatisfying answer, but it's probably worth reading the code. I briefly looked and it looked like there were decent do strings describing how things worked. And figuring out how code works from the source is such a valuable skill to have. 
Don't forget the amazing (but not-so-easy) \`asyncio\`!
The fact that almost everything is an iterator makes a lot of sense. 
he means duck typed, python is actually statically typed. dynamic typing means you can do something like 1 + '1' = '11'
I was just making a pun, not making a judgement on the practice. It's interesting though that what you describe seems to be a complete opposite of a common argument made by static typing proponents: that when I e.g. create a type `CustomerNumber: int` that simply holds an integer, the restriction is actually what I want to prevent anybody from passing another integer-like value into a function that takes `CustomerNumber`. `counter`, `numberOfItems` or `currentDay` might work without errors in that function, but passing them would clearly be a mistake that a duck-typing language like Python would never warn me about.
Ok. Thank you, that is helpful. Would you mind reformatting the code in your comment to look like the code in my question? I ended up reformatting it as well so it is easier to read. 
I'm on the app - I have no idea how to code format here sorry. I typed it out with nice spaces and everything :(
Fwiw the other answer about creating new exception types is probably the more correct way

Thanks for the response. I didn't mean to come off as terse, I appreciate any development towards this area is it does indeed make my life much easier. Perhaps you could put an example of the customisable resource endpoints in the Github [README.md](https://README.md), or even in the documentation (in a way that it's easier to find). I would suggest that nameko's documentation is a great example of documentation for someone shopping around for a microservices framework because it's very easy to get an idea of the capabilities very easily.
Majority of people cannot solve integrals or dance waltz. Who cares about the majority, if the majority is incompetent beyond any expectations? -- if you need to solve a problem, you ask professionals, you don't make a poll asking for opinion.
 Sorry about that!
You don't need Pro version of Pycharm to run a profiler. In fact, you don't need Pycharm to run the profiler at all. The Python built-in profiler should be good enough for what you are doing: https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/profile.html . As for `requests` - it wasn't built to be used in multi-threaded environments. It's a popular library, but for your case it's not a good match. As for the certificates. I don't believe it is a likely source of your problem. I don't know how Windows works in this respect, but it is not unreasonable to expect from OS to do some file-system caching (especially given how bad NTFS is!), so, even if Python doesn't cache certificates itself, it is very likely that OS doesn't really do I/O when fetching those certificates repeatedly (unless there's a ton of other I/O going on beside the reading of certificates). I would seriously consider substituting Tornado's HTTP client for `requests` though.
Like bearnaise sauce.
It is interesting to me about Pythonic/unPythonic. It seems like **static typing** is not acceptable for a lot of people. Actually, we spend a lot of time to write understandable docstring. For example: [requests ](https://github.com/requests/requests/blob/master/requests/api.py#L16) I think PEP 484 try to simplify these efforts and bring others benefits such as static type check (like typescript, they try to avoid runtime errors). Furthermore, if people feel uncomfortable to these weird syntax, they can write/generate [stub file](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#stub-files) (like header *.h in c/c++). It is an intuition way to remain ducking-type, compatibility and **Readable** in source code and separate your declarations to other files (check [typeshed](https://github.com/python/typeshed)). By the way, maybe just my examples not well :(. Don't feel frustrated with Python. Python is awesome!!

This absurd. I literally went to the website of the author you named and there it was... 3 freaking seconds. Are you plugging someone here ? https://www.kevinsheppard.com/Python_for_Econometrics
I think this is a "consenting adults" situation. Don't prevent users from trying to work around a problem in the underlying library or shortcoming in your API. Supply sane defaults for your context, even if different from the standard. You can forward unrecognized keyword arguments to the dependencies. Better yet, if you have several keyword args of your own and want to avoid a namespace collision and retain the benefits of trapping invalid arguments, create an optional kwarg such as `requests_kwargs` that is passed on.
I like it, but it does many other things I usually don't need.
Not to mention a sizable speedup from a standard loop, especially if you're looping on a list.append call
Yes, this works, thanks! It's a 2 part script - One to read a specific set of emails, the other is to take data from this emails and create entries in a google calendar
No, I don't know any others sorry. It's interesting how most of those libraries take the same approach as click
 Well, it's an answer, so thanks for that :) I might actually follow your suggestion. But first, I'm going to just try to use it same as TLS (with the key difference of using SOCK_DGRAM as opposed to SOCK_STREAM), and see what happens. The thought being, that if the coders of DTLS were wise, they'd make it as similar to TLS as possible. I'll see what happens (and what breaks)! If that doesn't go anywhere, I'll take a stab at looking at the code. Thanks a lot for your response.
&gt;A waste of time. Well, It all depends on what you building and how you building it. If you have microservice architecture, any small framework like flask, bottle, falcon etc. will be okay to do it. But in otherwise Django will be a better option just because have a lot of build in features and a lot of third-party extensions/libraries that will allow you to not to invent the wheel again. In my perspective, when our teams build few projects as MVP in small frameworks like flask or falcon, when we go beyond MVP most of this project was rewritten to Django or we spend a lot of time to implement features again just because something is not supported yet in particular framework. 
No, Python 2 isn't better in this regard.
I've done QT applications that access a database over a network or consume a rest api (so hybrid of the two). Many users accessing the same data alone does not necessitate a Web framework. If you need to do a lot of computation then sometimes it's best to do it client side/locally in which case full web app is less than ideal. So much depends on specifics... However, for an accounting system I would definitely do a Web App. I can't think of any really heavy operations that need to be done. 
Four spaces before a line of code. Poorly formatted code doesn't elicit responses. The first line after the imports makes no sense to me. That alone should throw errors. Also, read the documentation again and work through the tutorial, what you're trying to do is not difficult. 
So your stick was working fine then suddenly went faulty? That's genuinely so rare these days. You should probably go play the lottery tonight. Anyways, just reinstall the same version over the old one then do the uninstall. You may get an option to repair the install in which case click that. You probably have some registry entries and other bits and bobs that get removed at the end lying around. 
Thank you for sharing!
This is beyond beginner level. Anyways, get access to the database and generate your reports from there. 
Only lunatics use `from numpy import X`; it's convention to use `import numpy as np` instead.

Podcast Init has some great guests, but the hosts' voice is absolutely unbearable. 
f-strings are fabulous. Why wasn't string interpolation in that fashion implemented earlier?
Ahh cool the name sounds very intimidating haha but what are the differences in I guess code and application between the two version? (I’m pretty new)
Seems interesting I’m learning in 3.7 as well will definitely take a look into it thanks for sharing!
3.6 isn't too different from 3.7, tee core functions are still the same. 
Hell, at this point I usually just use * on a few fat libraries and then have my IDE optimize all imports

&gt;Aren't there talks now about making Django asynchronous? The guy who does django-channels laid out a theoretical road map of it all and even threw his hat in the ring to get stuff going. Yeah, but they've been talking about doing it since about 2015 I think.
I literally pointed that out on their [first release](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/7ou24s/ive_been_creating_a_python_web_framework_for_the/) that this might be a problem for them if they aren't making significant improvements on django but they're still persisting because they believe a few incremental improvements will be enough to get people to shift.
You will get a poll every five seconds (by default), but that doesn't include the time it took to process the event. Sending data is a blocking operation. Lomond doesn't do anything more than sending data over a socket. But the OS will buffer a lot of data, so a send is typically instantaneous. There is a risk of blocking for a significant time if you are sending a lot of data over the socket, and the server isn't receiving it fast enough. Which is often the desired behaviour; if you are sending a file, you want to wait until the server is able to receive it or you could run out of memory. If there handling the poll event is cpu intensive or you don't want to risk blocking the main loop, then you can do the sending in a thread, and leave lomond to process the received data.
You can already use type hinting : [https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) To enforce those type hints you can use multiple libaries for example: * [https://pyre-check.org/](https://pyre-check.org/) * [http://mypy-lang.org/](http://mypy-lang.org/)
 import numpy as np from np import X 
I agree with the fact that C++ is hard to learn and even harder to master but mastering a language is not about "**effectively learning the libraries**" , It is about expressing logic in a clean and simple way through that language. 
We don't need one. The difference between Python and JS is that if you want to run your code in the browser, to have to generate JS. If you want to run your code on the server, you are not restricted by the need of transpilation. If you are not happy with Python, use whatever language you like, compiled to native code, interpreted, transpiled, it doesn't matter, all options work fine. Browser are taking similar route with webassembly, which will allow to forget about JS. There are some languages that do that though: https://github.com/vindarel/languages-that-compile-to-python
I know about optional typing in python, but I imagine it could be beneficial (for the user who wants) to enforce this in a compilation step rather than using an external tool. 
A compiler would be an external tool as well?
You could include pyre inside your CI Pipeline or make an alias which runs pyre before executing your code. Maybe I don't understand your goal you try to accomplish.

I wanted to learn and thinking to learn the hard way. Then I saw this, why should avoid?
thank you for sharing this resourceful site. It will help me lot 
Lol man lol
Very true. At the time of this video, it was flaky, so I wanted to show how you could explicitly set it.
Good advice. One of the issues I was having with using the Python terminal with the venv already set was that the editor wasn't resolving dependencies for the venv pip installs, so I needed that second settings change to add them into the python path.
Excellent article, well explained and clear code. Thanks for taking the time!
Argh, it's annoying when these things happen because you can't win :) I retract my grumpiness and blame it on the lack of coffee.
Well, as a backend developer you're often expected to also deal with any server and database maintenance as wel as how various libraries function within the entire ecosystem. Complexity is everywhere as a developer, frontend or backend. I feel you'd just be shifting the complexity, I'm afraid. Whether servers and databases are more your cup of tea than CSS is up to you to decide.
To be fair, I meant desktop development. Not backend development but thanks for the informations anyway.
Further proof this was upvoted by bots
Look another bot
Oh look another bot
Low quality post upvoted to the top? Generic comments below praising the article and website without naming anything particular about it? This is a bot manipulated post
Why not just make a new list? `someList = []`. Also, /r/learnpython is a better place for questions like this.
Oh that would have been a better place to ask, well I'll just leave it up for a bit since it is already here. I need that list to hold values temporarily and when I need it to move it will transfer the data to another list, remove all of its current data and be ready to take new data. That is why I need the same list.
Python exists to make expressing logic clean and simple. It's the reason it's popular. Python is trivial compared to C++.
If you _really_ want to, you can use `someList.clear()`, but that's effectively the same thing.
Or wait are you saying to transfer the data then re-declare the list and make it empty?
Yes.
Ah I see, thanks a lot
The fastest way, although the least fancy, may be to use matplotlib inside a jupyter notebook. You can use ipywidgets to interact with matplotlib by having buttons that update the plots with your data. I'm on mobile, but I can find a link later if you need one. 
A lot of desktop development is turning into front-end development nowadays thanks to electron.js. You should probably be happy that your front-end development takes place in a browser that takes care of things for you, pre-electron.js desktop development had even more concerns such as OS compatibility and client-side dependability management.
As a guy that primarily does backend work in Python, I'd actually recommend you look into Electron for Node.js, since you mentioned you're familiar with JavaScript. That would give you a quicker start in a desktop environment and would let you leverage most of your existing skillset. Normally, desktop programming requires a totally separate set of skills or packages for the visual aspect of it, but Electron lets you use HTML or frameworks like Vue, if I'm remembering correctly. I love Python, but building a GUI with it or any other language is pretty far removed from how building a website is, so I'd really suggest you start from a place you know so it's a smaller step into that environment. Things off the top of my head you might need to consider more on a desktop vs your standard website: threads/concurrency, memory management, packaging
&gt;I know about optional typing in python, For the record, it's type *hinting* not typing. Typing would provide some kind of compiler optimizations, type hinting does not and is just for documentation and debugging purposes
The generic comments below really clinch it though. 
Wow, never saw a hater and a failure of a person like you, do you have any proof that this post was upvoted by "bots" ? it's ironic that you claim everyone who likes the post to be a "bot" when you are clearly atleast from your (stupid) username are a troll a really bad and amateur one to say the least. I would like you to write a better article than this one atleast you will be benefiting yourself and others with that time instead of spending it on hating, you really sound hurt :) .
Breakout is straightforward (but hard to get the balance right so its fun). Tetris, or something like a platform game if you use something like Cocos2D.
I'm not talking about desktop development, I'm talking about web development.
To be fair, memory management is not so much different than in web development as you need to manage your website's loading time too but yeah, I think all your other points are very valid. Thank you!
In looking at the Masonite [README](https://github.com/MasoniteFramework/masonite), it looks to me like it's trying to re-implement rails in Python. I'm not fond of rails (just a personal preference), but I think if I wanted this kind of framework I'd just use rails; Ruby isn't that hard to learn. I've used Django, Flask, and Falcon, and I'm not seeing anything in Masonite (at least from a cursory glance at its Github repo) that would make me choose it over these other 3.
&gt;But I would love someone showing how static type checking is pythonic? The part about it being optional, for one.
Why do you need Conda with PyPy? All the binary packages in the Conda repositories are built for CPython anyway.
I understand you probably put a lot of effort into this blog post and are hurt from someone calling it fake but your response is cringey. 
Good clarification, thanks :)
Can you only use built-ins?
I dont think there are any limitations as long as it gives the right solition...
I needed my project to stay in virutal environment. For this, I needed to use an environment created with "conda create" and not use virtualenv. Sorry if this does not make much sense, it is my first time working with a virtual environment and also first time I use pypy for one one of my projects, which I need for performance reasons.
What do you mean by "stay in virtual environment"? How does `virtualenv` not do that?
I want to have my pypy packages in a virtual environment because I need specific versions for my project. Virtualenv does that using the command I mentioned in my post, however I want to use a Conda environment because I had some troubles with specific package versions while using pip, so I'd like to just stick with Conda for now. I want to run my project using pypy and have my packages installed using conda and stored in a virtual environment.
That is not possible. Use `virtualenv`, or [Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/).
Oof. Based on your other submissions I'll assume you're the blog author. I think you need to work on how you deal with comments that you don't like. Replying with a childish name calling really doesn't help your cause.
Ok, it seems so. I will use virtualenv or pyenv. Thank you for your answer and time!
I think the hard part is that pythonic/unpythonic is ultimately a really subjective measurement. IME once you start learning it, you'll see how it fits into Python. That being said, these examples are pretty contrived (of course, that's the whole point!). I'd highly recommend to take them for a spin yourself in a decently-sized project and see how it goes! FWIW type inference is supported, so you only ever really put annotations in function arguments and empty data structures. 
Sounds good! Would appreciate if you could send over the link when you get a chance. 
You're welcome!

There is legitimate criticism and there is trolling, calling the people that liked the post to be "bots" with absolutely no evidence at all, going after every comment in the post and calling its writter a "bot" in addition to the disgraceful username he has which only re-enforce the idea that this kid is a depressed troll and not an actual person who wants my post to improve through pointing out the mistakes I made in it only shows that this kid doesn't seek a fruitfull conversation but pointless arguing. I deal with the comments I don't like based on how they were worded.
Absolutely not; 60 is not too late.
Crystal only have some syntax similarities with Ruby. Besides, it compiles to native code not, Ruby code :) You can find kind of a equivalent for Python with [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/), where the syntax has similarities with Python and compiles to C code. (By the way, Nim is awesome) 
Memory management is very different than load times on a website.

Anecdotally, nothing I've worked on as a backend engineer has been as frustrating as CSS. But then again I'm more analytically inclined, so design isn't my favorite.

In the section captioned "best python frameworks", only two, Flask and Django, are actually Python frameworks. Laravel is PHP, Rails and Sinatra are Ruby, and Phoenix is Elixir. Also, the writing badly needs proof-reading by a native speaker.
I mean Is desktop development as stressing as web development, not is web development as stressing as desktop development. I didn't develop deeply in desktop before and I ask about it, not the way around. 
I must be honest, just took a fast peek on the video and I saw command-line commands including "Linux", that alone is enough for me to lose interest. Sorry for being that honest.
OK, i tried changing the code but since deque creates strings of length 1 it doesnt create negative numbers...
Oh, I'm completely in favor of type hinting and static check warnings in editor/compilation. The part that really restricts duck typing utility for arguably no benefit is type enforcing, and the worst of all, a type-based dispatching.
And /u/buychristianslaves answered your question. Desktop development is becoming just web development, and has it's own set of issues.
I know almost nothing about this, but does using a framework like Flask increase or decrease the complexity of these issues?
You're talking to a bot, btw. I'm working on extending a bespoke python implementation with a standard module for work. Privately I'm looking into graph based dependency management for projects. What're you up to?
I checked and don't see your post retweeted by Suraj Raval, though that would be funny because not only is he all hype no substance but he also has a ton of obvious bots praising his Twitter posts. Is that where you are learning these habits from? If you are serious about AI then go to a Western university and study math and computers for a few years *at least*, and no "School of AI by Suraj Raval" credential is going to be worth anything
&gt;When are you going to riot against schools and universities aren't they rehashing the same thing a million times every year ? In universities you have college graduates teaching from the same few textbooks, so no they aren't writing new material 
OK, this is a strange requirement, but maybe not an impossible one, but... care to give more details about what you are trying to achieve? I'll try to explain why this is strange, and maybe it will give you some hints as to what you actually need to do. 1. The way Anaconda is set up, environments are views of the same libraries installed globally. This is how most popular package managers work. Think `rbenv`, `maven` etc. But, its concept of environments is an attempt to pretend it does the same thing as traditional Python (from python.org) tools do (which is sub-standard). 2. `virtualenv`, `venv` and a few other similar programs do something bad and bizarre: they copy all Python packages into... and here is where it gets messy: it's either the directory you specify inside your project, or in some global place in your file system, but still copy packages on per-project basis, or... they can inherit one project from another. Not only this leads to unnecessary duplication of Python packages on your computer, this also leads to inconsistencies, because a lot of Python packages come with binary extensions, which rely on third-party shared libraries, which are not handled by virtual environment in any way, and will be discovered by OS' own discovery mechanism... in combination with few tricks Python interpreter will turn, based on some obscure configuration variables. 3. Anaconda re-distributes some popular Python packages re-packaging them in such a way they can be used with `conda` environments (some Package maintainers are unaware of how Anaconda stores packages, so they need to be "fixed", or, some packages, which come with binary extensions in a form of source-code need to be compiled, and so Anaconda distributes binary wheels). Anaconda also comes with their own build of Python interpreter, the binary wheels are compiled against that interpreter, and will probably not work with the interpreter from python.org. I expect the same to be true of `pypy`. So, now you want to use `pypy` in `conda` environment... well, you can just find the installation of `pypy` and symlink it to `python` in that environment. And it might work... for a limited definition of "work", but will it do anything useful?--I don't know, probably not so much. This would be definitely not the way to set up a production system. 
If you still don't have an answer by the time I'm off work I'd love to help you out.
lol what's the point you are trying to make ? your comment is in my favor not the opposite.
Well, using a, decent, framework (which Flask is) decreases complexity in general. Though Flask is very lightweight and doesn’t make many choices for you unlike, for example, Django. So library management is slightly more effort with Flask.

No, it's like you're trying to write a new textbook. 
Wow welcome to python community
Fair enough based on your dumb ass comments we lost interest in you too
 your claim is "Look atany Django vs Flask thread and everyone notes that as their project grew they wish they had used Django instead. " point 1: "everyone" - one post, not "everyone" point 2: " notes as their project grew" - this person is referring to their own critique of *other* projects, not their own, they are claiming "I have encountered flask codebases with flaws". This has nothing to do with the project "growing" or anything else it has to do with poorly written code in the first place. You have made the opposite claim - that as their project *grows* beyond the basics (all of those things are basic) it becomes unmanageable. If you have beginner developers writing a codebase, it is a given that it will be unmanageable the more code they have to write. They should use django. This is no fault of Flask and Flask is not in any way "a waste of time". point 3: this is one person critiquing other people's code, so *that* person wished they used django, not the folks who actually wrote the apps. It is very likely those people who wrote these flask apps can hone their skills, improve what they're doing, and come back and write a much better application in Flask or Pyramid or whatever. So instead of "everyone" / "as the project grew" / "they wished", we have "one person" / "when the project was first written" / "that person suggested". With a competent developer, Flask, Pyramid or anything else is not a problem. If you are beginner, absolutely, use Django. It's great for beginners. 
I understand that years ago programming on Linux was easier, but nowadays is way more annoying than doing it on windows for multiple reasons. It may be just my personal taste, though.
I instantly become skeptical of any tutorials that have the `from X import Y` pattern. It's usually a bad smell indicative of terrible naming conventions later on.
Python is very fun to work in the only major complaint most people I was around the dependency management system which can be tricky
you're looking for a database server... you *connect* to a database to *query* the information, try getting a look at postgres and pgadmin
BrainF*ck is great, but Ook is better.
Competence in development is about choosing mature tools and not jumping onto hype trains
Python comes preinstalled on Linux, how does it get much easier than that?? Windows on the other hand does not. Personally I think windows is the hardest to program on especially for python. 
What do you mean a different version? It has both python 2 and 3 installed and you can switch between the two fairly easily. And what version of Linux have you been using that doesn't have a file explorer? 
I improved and fixes various bugs for the [Reddit bot](https://www.reddit.com/r/mexico/comments/96ys8n/lunes_de_empleo_13_de_agosto_2018/) that searches jobs for the users of r/Mexico. Full source code is available [here](https://github.com/PhantomInsights/mexican-jobs).

I'm not sure if there's a better solution than a naive one. You might want to look into it! What I can say, however, is that you're unnecessarily recomputing some stuff. This is what you're doing: sequence[:n] = sequence[0] + ... + sequence[n] # sum every element from 0 to n sequence[:n+1] = sequence[0] + ... + sequence[n+1] # sum every element from 0 to n+1 This is what you could be doing instead: sequence[:n] = sequence[0] + ... + sequence[n] = m # save this sum as var sequence[:n+1] = m + sequence[n+1] # use it here In case the pseudocode isn't clear enough: you're re-summing all the other element in the slice every time you introduce a new element into the slice. 
You won't believe who is #3!
didnt work :/ changed the last part into this: for n in range(i): tab.rotate(1) value = 0 for m in range(i): value += tab[m] if value &lt; 0: pozitivna -= 1 break print(pozitivna) is that what you meant?
Maybe it is just personal preference, but I think the terminal makes things much easier, and is far superior to windows CMD or even their powershell. For example, let's say I wanna install google chrome, on windows I'd need to go onto my web browser, go to their website, download it, go through the install GUI. While on Linux I can just type in "sudo dpkg i- google-chome-stable_current_ams64.deb" and that's it. I get where you're coming at but I personally believe that's easier.
Bots. Bots everywhere. Wonder if they're neural nets or just robot slaves.
Seems really cool But I can't experience the true power /: see when I launch `python img_term.py -img ~/dog.jpg` I get : [https://i.imgur.com/7TMOS9w.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/7TMOS9w.jpg) and I think my font (GNU Unifont) doesn't handle some chars because the pic is not square at all. Do you know why ? 
Thanks!
Going to get some, daughter will love em! Cheers
Also, I don't know exactly how you'll be going about this, or what the exact goal is, but don't store passwords. Store password hashes. 
No, my bad, check the edit.
i dont know what is pseudocode (english isnt my native language) and i didnt hear this word yet.
Hm, I can see that we aren't going to agree. That gibberish that you just typed to install chrome seems far more complicated to me than making 2 clicks. And also, you can make more unexpected misstakes, just check that you said chome instead of chrome. I would be annoyed if that happens to me and I have to re-type the commands all the time.
If any of that were true, Python wouldn't be dynamically typed. I come from 20+ years of static typing (worse, a language where all your variables needed to be declared beforehand and no type inference) and find Python to be much simpler, easier to read, and powerful. 
Just press the up arrow my dude and it brings back the command that you last entered so you can edit the mistake. It just seems strange to me that you're a programmer but cannot remember commands, they seem very similar to me. But you're right we probably aren't gonna agree lol. 
i did change it based on your suggestion... didnt i? 
Maybe this will help: sum of slice = (sum of last slice) + (new element in slice) Here's a concrete example: &gt;&gt;&gt; some_list = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] &gt;&gt;&gt; sum(some_list[:4]) 4 &gt;&gt;&gt; sum(some_list[:3]) + some_list[4] 4
optional typing, async, data classes and the recent assignment expression are the turning point for me, where I started learning a new programming language. I feel like Python has jumped the shark. I hope whenever Python4 rolls around that it will be an exhaustive spring cleaning of the language and stdlib.
 value = 0 for m in range(i): value += tab[m] thats how i generated partial sums

If groupby returned something with a length, it would mean that it could only consume things with lengths; which would mean if those are lazy iterators, they could only consume things with lengths and so on. If you want lazy iteration anywhere in your chain (which you may well do), a single length-dependent link in that chain will force you to realise everything above it, which isn't necessarily what you want when using lots of things.
I have been doing desktop development for quite some time, here are some pointers: * The UI frameworks/toolkits are quite advanced but very few support layout design with HTML-like systems. You will most likely design the layouts by hand. * Responsive design is also available, you will require to understand how the various containers work. Some stack items horizontally, others vertically and in tiles. This can be the most difficult part. * Accessibility is also available in most UI frameworks, you won't have to worry about this one too much since it is auto implemented. * Cross platform compatiblity is very good but you will need to study the documentation to know which UI elements work on which platform. You won't have trouble with buttons, lists, checkboxes, radio buttons and labels. * No CORS non sense, you can connect to any website or web service without issues.

Can I use JN as a client front end along with Python running on the server as a back end?
&gt; For the record, it's type hinting not typing. This sentence doesn't make sense. In English gerund of this particular kind would imply either attaching a particular property to an object previously not having the property (compare to painting) or making a property of an object explicit (compare to counting). When something is painted, it receives a property of being of the color of the paint. When something is counted, no new property is created, we simply assert an existing property. Types are a property of code that is inseparable from it. It is not possible to remove them or to apply more. So, what you seem to be describing as type hinting is in no way different from typing, it just adds an unnecessary overspecification (typical for documents written by engineers and never edited by more literate people). Furthermore, typing, or if you so desire, type hinting, is orthogonal to compilers and optimizations. I can agree with it being a kind of documentation, in the same way one can view variable names as documentation, or a file extension as documentation etc.
Weird. I was actually trying to say thanks because long articles like that are really difficult to put together.
SQL database, would be my guess (I'm not the kind of person for giving advice here, lol, I'm not strong enough in this field). But passwords should never be stored anywhere. Store a hash of the password, and have them, on their end, hash the password and send the hash. Compare hashes.
yes, please :D
Fun story to share: I have been trying bits and stuff for some decades now but nothing serious (.net, javascript, html, etc) but I only got into programming seriously for the past 2-3 years. At that moment, I choose Python and learnt throught windows IDLE in an autodidactive way (not sure if that's an english word, as I'm not english) so I am missing sometimes basic knowledge that you would learn on a proper course. It took me a bit a lot to figure out stuff like pip precisely because it uses the console. From there I jumped to PyCharm and then eventually focused on desktop programs (specifically for windows) or bots AI. Now I can manage to create or download my own projects, create efficient scripts, GUIs, web-scrap and pretty much anything that you can do with python on windows. But the few times I even tried to set up some bots on Linux, what a nightmare. I think we are in a time when a programmer can just learn at windows (although, that depends on the target of the product).
In any conversation with context it won't be confusing: one is an IDE, the other is a parallel programming framework.
OK thanks
of course, I'm stupid, but help me, please..
Hmm... LOoks like a lot of noise to me.
Aye we all got our own way of learning, I still respect anyone that has learned how to program, especially if they're self taught. So cheers! 
Continuing my work from here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/93esip/whats_everyone_working_on_this_week/e3ji8ze. Finished the documentation for the initial versions of template and published it. I think my initial assumption about what is already possible is wrong.. And COM/NET mightnot be the best way to do it as PowerBI/Qlik/Tableau already provides a lot of the functionality. This week I plan to start looking into PowerBI, and if there are any Python integration and what database structure I can use for the visualization layer. Have to find out whether I can access PowerBI/QlikSense for free for testing it out.. And whether there are any python interfaces. Also I have to start approaching some small businesses to check if they are interested in the previous plan.. 
Enaml Native looks nice
I think something beyond type checking should be had in Python, because with duck typing you don't really care about the type, but what the type can do. While there are certainly cases here and there where specific type checking can be valuable, for the most part, I just want to make sure the user knows what methods an object has or what methods a function requires for an object. In this sense, Python could use "interface" checking rather than type checking.
No.
Plumbum.colors has python -m plumbum.cli.image script has been able to do this for a while, including a double resolution mode that uses half block chars and the background color to increase the y resolution by 2. Still cool, though.
Is there a reason you want to learn python rather than brush up on your processing? I've never seen anyone do processing in an IDE, but I'll admit I haven't looked for one. I got my start in programming doing interactive art/music, and now do it full time (minus the art/music). IDEs with syntax highlighting can be super helpful, and many will help you with autocompleting variables or suggesting function names. If you're doing processing, I bet you would like this book: [https://natureofcode.com/](https://natureofcode.com/) Happy hacking.
Thank you for that. Looks very useful. Yes mostly for Processing but I also am wanting to use Python 3 on its own. I also have taken interest in the programming language ChucK for music and audio.
I would steer you away from chuck only because it lacks good garbage collection (more jargon yes). Look into supercollider, or tone.js or https://gibber.cc/ Best of luck. 
I suggest getting an Arduino and learning some basic electronics so you can actually make programmable artwork. To get some ideas of what can be done with electronics in art, look up Naomi Wu for examples that focus more on the art side or Sarah Petkus and Micah Elizabeth Scott for examples that focus more on the electronics and programming side. (FYI, I'm just an engineer.) I would expect Python to not be that useful for small art projects since it has too much overhead for common microcontrollers. Where it makes sense are larger projects that use embedded Linux devices such as Raspberry Pi.
Thank you man I will check those out! It is all very exciting. Spent the past week researching technologies and apps and there is so much stuff out there that I could never have imagined. I have a custom-built and powerful PC and recently learned of virtual desktops. Blows my mind that now I can use my PC from my iPad from campus or at a coffeshop or wherever and have all the computing power with me!!
also a great idea!
Paypal absolutely does not store passwords. Please read about security before you implement something. E.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function#Password_verification
I'd be concerned about it's dependency on django-picklefield. It should be using a safe serialization method like JSON for security reasons. I know celery isn't great, but I don't think this a good alternative on that alone.

I didn't literally mean
I did not say Python doesn't have typing, I said OP meant "optional type hinting" in his sentence.
&gt; ***Ad hominem*** at its best , not surprised tho that's what trolls know best. if you scroll down to his 24th July posts you will find my post but then again jealousy is blinding you, Siraj Raval is bad and overhyped, everyone that i hate and disagree with has no real fans just bots, you are the fan that everyone is hoping to have lol. you are such a childish troll, the conversation will end here. have a nice day kid :) . Google his name, saying all he does is hype is a widely shared opinion. Also yes a lot of responses to his comments don't address anything he says they just say he is the best and so smart.
I think what would have been cool is a few examples on how to structure a) a web app, b) a data science project, c) library code. Useful things that people need to know include setup.py, requirements, makefiles, imports/relative imports. Actually in your linked project you seem to be struggling with your imports there. 
For better prioritization of project tasks according to the number and weight of dependencies. Not sure if it'll work the way I want it to, yet, but I intend to find out!

Character generator for the pathfinder play test. I didn't do enough up front planning. As such, I've rewritten several pieces, several times. My expectation is that the rules will change frequently for a while (it is a play test). My design focuses on a generic "grant" system. All of the character options (class, feats, equipment, etc) grant the character specific things. Those things might be ability boosts or hit points or additional feats. To get ability scores, I pull all the grants that target abilities and process their values. No requirements at the moment, but eventually I'll put a front end up so there will be that.

I just made my first web app, its bare bones now and I just realized that the amount spent on Python is very very very minimal for me, and 49% of my time is trying to figure out the peculiarities of deploying on Google App engine and why is there 502 response and the other 49% of my time figuring out React.
Technically, that's exactly how it works. It really depends on what you want to do with it. It's a nice way to demo code.
Makes sense. People don't need to worry about how you build your image but if you already have a requirements.txt anyway I guess it does save a step.
Do you know how you would go about doing it, logically? Python is just a tool, can describe your algorithm?
I still can't believe it
Yeah, I agree with you. Interaction with users is a nightmare because you will have to count every single possibility which is very frustrating to frontend developers. Thank you for the suggestions! I will definitely try backend though!
My script uses the half block char. 
My updated version uses truecolor. It even renders video.
I would suggest actually creating a test account which sends an actual email to some address, which you then query to see if it actually arrived. We use this sort of pattern all the time at work and it's a really good indicator if things are broken and particularly if public API's are down. You can do this with pytest as well, using parameters, fixtures, assertions etc. 
Hey so I tried what you did, and clicked repair. [Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/63P34bn) It doesn't work, and somehow it said I canceled the installation. &gt;Should I delete all contents from AppData\\Local\\Programs or AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python or not delete anything at all to completely uninstall python?

It's great to work on and with something that does exactly what you want, the way you want. But of course, plumbum doesn't actually do anything you don't ask of it.
I see what you did there. LOoks like you have a sense of humour.
You don't need to do anything special. As long as you have the reqs.txt file in your repo, you can just install pipenv, and go to the base of your repo, (assuming this is where you keep your reqs.txt file) call init &amp; install. pipenv install looks for a requirements.txt and install everything into a newly generated virtual environment. After that, you will have 2 new files in your repo, pipfile and pipfile.lock. This is very similar to npm's package.json and it's corresponding lock. Final thing for you to do is to invoke a shell via pipenv shell or the preferred thing to do is to auto activate the virtual env for the project whenever you cd into it. 
Virtual envs generated by virtual-env wont get used anymore. AFAI pipenv creates it's venvs in a different location. pipenv init command is run like this: pipenv --python 3.6 It will look for 3.6 and use that as the default python inside the venv. What I do is, usually set my python version locally via pyenv, feels like a better approach. Then, when I generate my venv via pipenv, the local python version is used inside the venv. Hope that makes sense. Pyenv here does nothing but manage multiple versions of python at the same time. If you haven't used pipenv, I highly recommend it. Makes things a lot simpler.
That makes perfect sense. It seems to package a lot of awesome features together. I was just worried about my current projects setup not converting over well. Can you set hooks? Like postmkproject in virtualenv-wrapper. 
Honestly I don't understand why this problem was given to solve. This is an algorithm problem rather than a pure programming problem. Basically since n is at most 10\^6 , if the code runs in time proportional to n\^2 or even longer, then it is going to result in time limit exceeded error. You have to think of a solution that runs in time proportional to n. Even then this 2s time limit is based on faster languages like C++ and Java, so it will still result in time limit exceeded error. I doubt if it will ever be possible in Python. (My solution runs in 6s in another programming site.) To give a hint about a faster solution anyway, every "sum of the first i numbers of some cyclically shifted sequence" can be expressed as either a\[x\]+a\[x+1\]+...+a\[y\] or a\[x\]+a\[x+1\]+...+a\[n-1\]+a\[0\]+...+a\[y\] (where a is the original sequence before shifting). Also, if we define S\[x\] as a\[0\]+...+a\[x\], then the whole array S can be computed in time proportional to n. 
I think sometimes it's pretty hard and feel distracted to learn some new syntax. If you learn javascript, we will feel amazing that so many popular features which js developers use has already existed in python. Like ECMAScript, python has the similar features (async/await, pack/unpack, ...etc). I think js steal python's idea. (just kidding). However, why it's so hard for us to embrace these awesome features?
I don't have the code in front of me at the moment, but I create a queue, spin up the threads using a method that will grab an item from the queue and process it, then stick each of the server objects into that queue. After I collect the basic data I basically do the same thing inside that queue to grab all the additional data for the mailboxes. I'll certainly check out aiohttp; I think I only went with Requests because it was easy and I was still learning some of the basics at that point. Honestly I wouldn't want to push the servers too much, don't want the server team freaking out and the Tomcat servers on those things have been known to up and die just because more than 10 people were logged in at once provisioning new mailboxes. :\

Yeah.. I didn't think about the built-in profiler, but I had already been thinking about getting the Pro version for some of the UML features and its honestly easier to get that than individual packages sometimes. Heck, I'm in IT support where I might need to remote into a user machine and repair something and don't even have admin rights to my own machine anymore. I wouldn't be surprised if you're correct about the caching thing as well, but the multiple openings of that .pem file stood out like a sore thumb while I was monitoring - figured I'd at least try to move some stuff around and use the session feature as sort of a band-aid until I can focus on this specifically. I mentioned it in another reply, but while I want to speed it up - I do want to make sure I throttle it appropriately as the Tomcat service on those servers can be a bit flaky and don't really want to upset the server team - give them the right reason and they'd simple cut us off and expect us to do all the work by hand, whether that's reasonable or not.

I think "Interface checking" is subset of "type checking". Actually, using annotation + mypy can achieve "interface checking" before runtime. Therefore, we can avoid runtime errors. (I hate raising AttributeError after running 10 hours). Nevertheless, type checking will be powerful like: p = re.compile("some pattern") m = p.match("some string") m.groups() without static type checking, the snippet will raise exception when m does not match. If we give some type hint, like: p: Pattern = re.compile("some pattern") m: Match = p.match("some string") m.groups() # it is possible to raise AttributeError type checker will warn us that "Optional[Match[str]]" has no attribute "groups". As a result, we save our time :) In fact, mypy is so powerful that most of the case you don't really need to declare type explicitly. Just like `:=` in go or `auto` in c++, so we don't need to worry that Python will become unreadable. Sorry for making many people feel frightened. 
My path was: - get a CS degree - do something else for ~9 years because Java was awful and it didn’t seem like a fun career - learn Python and read /r/programming for fun in the meantime - have someone I knew from Reddit ask me to apply to a job - become a professional developer using Python Hope that helps. 
Yikes, yeah, that is concerning from a security attack elevation POV. 
&gt;4- When dockerizing, generate a requirements.txt file from pipenv, pipenv lock -r &gt; requirements.txt &gt; &gt;5- Automate this process so that your reqs.txt stay up-to-date. &gt; &gt;6- Use a small docker image for python, 90% it's going to be alpine. Set the image up however you want, copy the stuff you need into the image, including the reqs.txt file. There is no need to have pipenv installed here because your container is an isolated environment anyway, so you can just pip install everything as you would normally. &gt; &gt;7- Finally setup your CI/CD pipeline. I got confused at this step. I thought docker and pipenv did very similar things as each other. Why do we need both? Could you explain how docker and pipenv interact with each other and why we want to use both?

So kind of along these lines, are there any resources anyone has come across that could help get you started making projects with folders, files, etc.? There has to be something out there...
Ah, that's excellent then. As long as you're keeping the threads alive for extended periods of time then it's okay. If the servers are picky then you'll definitely want to keep the request rate down. You can't share a `requests` session across multiple threads so that's where `aiohttp` might be nice, but as long as you're maintaining a session per thread then that should help the web servers cope if you try to pump up the request rate a bit. Connection re-use should help things out a ton.
Thanks for both tips, I updated the prize pool and will look into the apriori stuff. I think it's more likely to be useful if I look at a bigger set of games. Looking at all the professional games rather than just Team Liquid seems like an obvious start.

I don’t think his argument is wrong. You and him both offer good points. He’s right when he says they’re not strings... if a beginner is learning f-strings they should understand what is possible with f strings. Well, what is possible with f strings? They can take any python expression and format that into the string. In other words they run python code, exactly what my man said. You’re preaching ignorance, though. It’s definitely better to look at f strings as what they actually are, instead of what they seem like they are.

Python is used in much more than data science and web dev. But with regard to these two fields, for data science you will need familiarity with libraries like numpy, pandas, sklearn, tensorflow/pytorch to start with. Apart from this data science requires at least preliminary knowledge in mathematical subjects like calculus, linear algebra, probability and stats. for web dev I have come across libraries like django, flask etc. These are for the backend. You will still have to write the frontend part in HTML, CSS and javascript mostly. Apart from this you have selenium for web testing, pyspark for big data, pygtk or pyqt or tkinter for gui development, kiwi for cross-platform app development, bokeh or dash for dashboard development etc. There are plenty of tutorial articles and videos on each of these libraries. But even if you can learn one of these libraries completely in 90 days I suppose learning the background skills required to use them effectively is going to take you much longer. Also, one of the reasons many of these libraries are widely used is because they give enough freedom of expression on the part of the programmer. And learning to use that freedom productively is something you learn only from experience.
One can recognize that you are great due to the fact that your exemplary plugin is for fishshell. 
Seconding RQ. It's nice.
Working on some [network utilities](https://github.com/hkamran80/network_utilities) and a data collection/organization system.
Personally my problem aren't the features themselves (except assignment expression) but how it integrates with the language. Optional typing has really ugly syntax but we were told it would be absolutely optional. Now data classes are built upon it. Assignment expressions need better syntax *and* a better case for having them. The pep really lacked any reasoning for why this was important enough to create new syntax. It is problematic in my opinion when using new features make a language look like a new one too.
A bunch of the links just give a 404 for me.
Keegan, you probably need to reboot and try again. Also make sure you try the uninstall as the same user that did the install (usually as administrator). So right click and try run as admin. By the way, try a hard reboot first using Shift + click on Restart. Just deleting the directory isn't enough as you'll have plenty of registry entries too meaning you haven't accomplished a proper clean uninstall. 
I'm not a developer, but knowing python got me my current job as a process engineer. The engineering manager wanted to automate some data analyses and saw that I knew a couple programming languages. I learned the language in about 2 months for my senior project in college. Now I use it for complex analyses. We have statistical software where I work, but it has predefined functionality whereas I can implement whatever I want in python.
Yeah when 3.5 came out it was the first time one could really consider a proper implementation of it. They were a bit dumb not to have started back then though since having asynchronous still at least two years out is really going to hurt Django. Then again, there was still a lot of uncertainty about the future of async in the Python world and many expected that there would still be large shakeups. I think there was also a decent wait based on the fact that async Web servers were even then not really de facto and some best practices still had to be figured out. That's not true any more. Django is rarely a first mover, but it always does things right. Then again, even whilst it is synchronous, Django scales really well and has good performance if you know what you're doing... Key there being knowing what you're doing. 
I went through exactly the same process as you’re in now—I used Python for several years without type hinting, and the need to import from typing still annoys me. After using it for 18 months now, untyped Python doesn’t look unpythonic to me, but does make me slightly anxious—typing helps massively, especially when refactoring with PyCharm. And yes, I still religiously document types in docstrings; unnecessary duplication perhaps but I like the help() format.
I have 36 and i lean python , bash and c++. Because there is no limit! 
This just gave me hope. I'm 3/5th there!
I wrote a script here: https://gist.github.com/JonnoFTW/d4ba1f3b88f0c376981dddadd2a21e7b You'll need `pandas mlxtend requests`. The output table shows how often those particular things occurred together. Eg. running `main.py Virtus.pro` you can see all games between liquid and VP, so we get a table like: 0.176471 (win, against_Disruptor) 0.176471 (against_Sand King, win) 0.205882 (with_Rubick) 0.205882 (Virtus.pro, with_Rubick) 0.235294 (Virtus.pro, with_Venomancer) 0.235294 (Virtus.pro, radiant, loss) 0.235294 (Virtus.pro, dire, win) 0.235294 (dire, win) 0.235294 (with_Venomancer) 0.235294 (Virtus.pro, against_Sand King, radiant) 0.235294 (radiant, loss) 0.235294 (against_Sand King, radiant) 0.264706 (against_Disruptor) 0.264706 (Virtus.pro, against_Disruptor) 0.264706 (Virtus.pro, radiant, win) 0.264706 (radiant, win) 0.264706 (loss, dire) 0.264706 (Virtus.pro, loss, dire) 0.294118 (Virtus.pro, against_Sand King) 0.294118 (against_Sand King) 0.500000 (loss) 0.500000 (win) 0.500000 (Virtus.pro, dire) 0.500000 (dire) 0.500000 (Virtus.pro, loss) 0.500000 (Virtus.pro, radiant) 0.500000 (Virtus.pro, win) 0.500000 (radiant) 1.000000 (Virtus.pro) So we can see that, for example: * Liquid win against a disruptor 17% of the time, * VP picks disruptor against liquid 26% of the time. * Liquid pick veno 23% of the time Of course you could filter out the rows so you only get rules that have "win" in them or have a certain number of elements in them.
Dude, read what you are replying to. I'm saying you are misusing the word "typing" (I don't believe it is a real word, but if it means anything, then "optional type hinting" and "typing" must be the same thing). I never said anything about you saying whether or not Python has "typing", whatever it is.

Good summary fo what's new in Python 3.7
For some jobs, all you need is to have a pulse. In particular, in our industry, Q&amp;A is viewed as an unqualified labor. So, if you wanted that, apply, and be nice at the interview, and promise to learn some coding, and you will have a 50% passing rate.
I just go: pipenv shell Then: code . 
There is a lot of simple socks5 servers on the GitHub. About 100-200 lines of code.
Not really. The problem here isn't with itertools but with inconsistencies about how iterators work in Python. There's no reason why iterators don't implement `__len__` by simply consuming all the input and measuring it. Will this be a good thing to do?--In most cases, no. But, in some cases, like the above, it would actually be a good thing. Similarly, I find myself having to write `list(map(...))`, and there is no reason I should, but some builtin functions would not automatically convert iterators to the type of their arguments, while others will.

So what you're saying is you have no understanding whatsoever of iterators, and you thought broadcasting that fact was a better use of your time than writing a 2-lines wrapper: def groupby_eager(*a, **kw): return ((k, list(g)) for k, v in itertools.groupby(*a, **kw)) &gt; First of all.... no len on _grouper. There's no len on _grouper because it's an iterator, not a collection. For all _grouper knows, its group is infinite. &gt; Second of all, the _grouper iterable(i'm aware it's not technically an iterable), if you cast it to a list Python has no casts. You can't cast something to a list, you create a list. From an iterator. Which consumes the iterator. &gt; it is no longer iterable Of course it is. It's just empty. Because you've consumed it. When you created a list from it. &gt; This is the crappiest part about OOP; everyone is obsessed with returning an object that looks and feels familiar at first glance It has nothing to do with OOP, and it's not _grouper's fault if you don't understand what an iterator is. &gt; that no one checks to see if their object is consistent and produces expected behavior. _grouper is consistent and produces expected behaviour, you just have to have the barest understanding of what you're working with. As with most everything else. &gt; So the solution is as follows, and is both un-pythonic and horribly smelly. TIL it's "un-pythonic" and "horribly smelly" to make a list when you want to work on a list, my entire career is a lie. Lol.
Thank you so much man! I ran it as Administrator and repaired it. The uninstall was successful
I'm just learning Python and I'm 61. I've learned a number of languages in the past five decades. They change all the time. It's been a while since I've used Fortran or PL/I or ASM or Tutor or Mark4 or APL or SAS or COBOL. Early on it was paper tape storage. Then punched cards. We've come a long way, baby. :)
Glad you came right. 
&gt;if you cast it to a list to check it's length for the first point, it is no longer iterable Yes, because the list constructor already has exhausted the iterator. If you already cast it to list, why don't you use the list?
It's absolutely possible. Whether it's a good idea or not really depends on what the script does.
&gt; There's no reason why iterators don't implement __len__ by simply consuming all the input and measuring it. Because then calling `len` will change the argument, which is very unexpected. If you want to consume an iterable an measure its length why won't you do it explicitly? Something like: `sum(1 for _ in iterable)` 
Does Python and adb (android debug bridge) work together?
You can execute the `adb` command from Python. You can probably also figure out how to speak the `adb` protocol from Python directly, though that will be harder.
Can you elaborate more about how you use Snappy and what the result is? Because I see Snappy mainly as “Ubuntu show” limiting me what it can do when I need also some non Python dependencies and other stuff. On the other hand, classic “old-fashioned” Debian package will be there for long time without breaking change with any possibility.
You talk of a beginner learning f'strings - then defend an answer which confronts such a beginner with the inner byte code of one particular implementation of the language *specification*. I would say that is too much for someone new to Python. I would go further and state that it most likely goes against the language designers obvious aims shown by their naming of the feature. You don't need to delve into implementation details to find out how adjacent string and f'string literals interact. You can draw conclusions from test results that work. The good thing about Python is that you don't need to learn too much gory detail before you can get something doing. It is in the spirit of: `print("Hello world")` Rather than needing to first know about classes and other aspects of OO to do the same in say Java. Don't scare the newbies!
It depends on what ps script does. For example, you can manipulate Exchange mail only with PowerShell and there isn't api for.
Hello! I'm a bot! It looks to me like your post might be better suited for r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. That said, I am a bot and it is hard to tell.

I've done quite a bit of both PS and Python. If you're doing anything that routinely interacts with Windows objects then you're much better sticking to Powershell. If you're on a windows box, and need to run a script at startup, PS is dead simple. If you need to do a scheduled task periodically on Windows, PS is great. That being said, I find programming in python to be much more enjoyable and much more readable because white space. I also think the learning curve for Python to be gentler as well. 
So the way it works is parts and apps, if you need to build something from source that isn't python then it's just another part, you also can grab from the repository directly. So for instance I was having trouble using pip and getting a dependency in python I grabbed the one from the Ubuntu repo instead. It worked the same way. How I specifically use it is I generate the snapcraft.yaml using python and use dictionaries and some generated fields. You can just use yaml directly though if you don't want do that. I can't really point to the repository since I privited it on Github but the basic idea is: 1. setup.py to build the package, so just using that in the same way you normally would 2. Snappy will work just with setup.py and build a package with that with the basic python snapcraft.yaml they have in the docs 3. If you need something from the repo then add that to site-packages in the parts section. So in my case I needed python-dev and python3-gevent (because it wasn't building) 4. The apps section is where you get to use the code you wrote, you can either have it as an executable or a daemon and you can read the docs to see how to do the daemon part but all apps need is a name and a command 5. Then you can run your commands from the commandline, if they are a daemon you can do start, stop, restart stuff because it uses systemD I'd give some examples but the reddit editor isn't very nice with yaml. 
Yep, what he said. You need to be able to describe your solution in plain English before you start programming. Then you can think about the language part. To answer your question though, yes python will be fine if I think you'll do what I would do, which is to take in data and perform statistical analysis.
You perfectly described your workflow. Each of the 1. to 5. points are basic file and string manipulations.
Right, but I can't seem to find a package/syntax that lets me interact with outlook draft files through python
Clearly the deeply detailed argument I was looking for, thank you. 
So I mean, yes, the company is doing MITM, but it's normally done by breaking and inspecting the traffic. It's good for network defense, and with the users properly notified (like having to acknolwedge a consent to be monitored when logging in) is completely fine and legit. it's not trash or bad or anything else. It's honestly a fine way to conduct information security and is becoming more and more common. That said, the learning process to utilize the self signed cert is a 'fun' one.
How about using something like [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter)?
You'll like to know the 2x3 mosaic characters used for ITU T.100 Teletext systems will soon-ish to be added to Unicode. You'll have to find the best 2 colors for that character cell, but you'll have 1.5 times the vertical resolution and twice the horizontal.

Are outlook draft files not in plain text with formatting? I have no idea, but maybe go more generic in your search for libraries, like leave out outlook and go for email draft as email is a standard
Install library and call service. There's nothing to learn here but an API.
The thing is, the draft mails are of type ".oft" Office Item Template so it's not standard plain text
Nice, I'll update when they come out and my terminal font supports them. 
Sorry to bother you again - but do you perhaps know how I get a 3x1 as a result and not a 5x5 This is what python gives me as a last Matrix: n = np.random.normal(0, 1, ([3, 1, Nx, Ny, 2*Nz])).view(complex) [[-2.36362575e-01-1.58615005e+00j, -1.58848373e-01-1.16523133e+00j, 1.36220922e+00+8.92355066e-02j, 1.24464729e+00-9.09605644e-01j, -5.73117810e-01-2.90960262e-01j], [-6.90476791e-02+6.88217642e-01j, 1.94956386e+00-1.32718648e+00j, -1.26929202e+00-2.27579674e-01j, 7.42702800e-02-1.51650421e+00j, -1.43120691e+00-4.21127253e-01j], [ 1.29479698e+00-9.59211085e-01j, 6.93054384e-02-9.60743198e-01j, -7.40442950e-01-5.45922337e-01j, 1.44568337e+00-3.32390212e-01j, -1.59349341e+00-1.18097853e+00j], [ 8.24455606e-01-1.22761476e+00j, -1.59215833e-01+8.08338430e-02j, -1.84325819e+00-5.18712543e-01j, 3.83004870e-01+1.58321459e+00j, -4.67167527e-01+1.05188955e+00j], [ 8.38486208e-01+7.23864257e-01j, 2.07515227e-01-3.61950433e-01j, -1.00559398e+00+3.06507806e-01j, 5.19866964e-01+9.46480605e-01j, 1.82239835e+00+1.04790050e+00j]]]]]) But I need it like this (from Matlab): n(:,:,5,5,5) = -0.0679 + 0.9594i -0.1952 - 0.3158i -0.2176 + 0.4286i
It is certainly _not_ good for network defense to give attackers yet another point at which sensitive data is decrypted, especially when at that point you're centralizing the sensitive data of many of your users, making it a much more attractive target. So no, it's not fine. Even companies such as Yahoo, with almost unlimited resources to spend on securing their core data such as users' passwords, have shown that this kind of thing is _very_ hard to defend. The best way to defend the data is not to have it.
But it's readable to you, not encoded? that is exactly what you can do with python. Manipulate a piece of text in any way you see fit. 
Please don't port it to python2.7. It's a dead language already. Python3.7 is the way to go. 
Yeah I mostly dislike powershell from a this is fun point of view but it seems once it works it works pretty well at doing windows things ... which granted it should. 
A minor correction, the classic approach to speech recognition uses HMMs, but only as a way to add more (time dependent) structure to the system. The observation distribution is captured by a neural network model. There are other approaches that rely solely on neural networks, and I believe those approaches are the one's Google and MS are using.
You're missing the point, and thinking from the wrong perspective. Break and inspect is typically on user traffic going OUT of the organization. I.e. me browsing reddit right now. So yeah, it's decrypted at rest, on the network devices you're using for it, such as Bluecoats. These devices are normally not external to your network, and are generally not even the perimeter. But yes, if someone got into your environment, and got Bluecoat creds, they would be able to possibly set up a way to create a tap of the decrypted data. Yet comparing it to things like Yahoo's user databases makes no sense. That's data at rest. You don't break and inspect your own databases (i.e. passwords). This is web traffic already flowing through proxies. It get opened up so IPS/IDS can inspect it, and on the same device encrypted back up using it's cert, and sent back on it's network path. You are literally comparing apples to oranges here.
That's the same path one of my coworkers followed. Started as a level 1 call center rep, develop scripts for us to use to make our jobs easier, and eventually moved on to become an automation engineer. I'm actually following a similar path, going to be starting a new job as a devops engineer in a few weeks after spending nearly two years in the call center.
1. (Try and) store the first item from an iterator. 2. Try and store the second item from the iterator: 1. If you can't then `it's crappy` 2. If you can then `do something` with the iterator; and the first and second items captured above (if necessary) The above doesn't force you to necessarily exhaust the iterator by first generating a list.
That doesn't sound possible, unless you memorized the entire code-base.
Use [pywin32](https://pypi.org/project/pywin32/) package to get access to the windows COM objects. This will give you access to all the [functions and objects](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vba/vba-outlook) that are available in outlook. I have used pywin32 to write python scripts for excel and microsoft project this way. It takes some setup and reading. There should be lots of examples of pywin32 and excel, so search for that on ideas how to use pywin32.

PyFilesystem works with ram disks, Zip files, Tar files, ftp servers, WebDav, Amazon S3, Dropbox etc.
Unexpected to whom? In a language that allows mutation of everything? No, it is exactly as expected. &gt; why won't you do it explicitly? Because this will prevent me from writing generic code? Welcome to version of Go that is fifty times slower and cannot do things in parallel?
This is awesome. Best way to learn is by applying your skills to a new challenge!
&gt; The problem here isn't with itertools but with inconsistencies about how iterators work in Python. What inconsistencies? &gt; There's no reason why iterators don't implement __len__ by simply consuming all the input and measuring it. Iterators can be infinite, consuming an iterator is a side-effect in and of itself, and consuming an iterator can generate additional side-effects. Python *could* have a richer family of iterator protocol*s* providing size hints or even exact sizes (as Rust does), but that would not *actually* be of much use to the language (it's useful in Rust because it lets consumers pre-allocate collections and the like), and itertools.groupby *still would not be a sized iterator*, because `_groupby` has no idea what its length beyond "&gt;= 1". &gt; Will this be a good thing to do?--In most cases, no. Which sounds like a pretty good reason not to do it. &gt; Similarly, I find myself having to write list(map(...)), and there is no reason I should Becaauuuse? &gt; some builtin functions would not automatically convert iterators to the type of their arguments, while others will. ???
That is again false. It is because you cannot imagine it to be possible, not because it is in principle impossible. Yes, calling `len` will consume the iterator, but it doesn't have to throw the result away, instead, it can simply store the result and expose it on repeated access. Whenever you use up an iterator, the result is again, something you can iterate over, so, there is no reason that `__len__` will not implement some sort of caching. I.e. once you called `len()`, you'll no longer be able to benefit from lazy calculations, but maybe you never even wanted it in the first place / are pretty willing to give it up in order to be able to write generic code that treats all sequences in the same way?
IMO you're not doing yourself any favors by pigeonholing yourself into a single language. The most important thing is to learn how to **PROGRAM**, not how to use a single language. The core concepts of software development span across languages. You're also not doing yourself any favors by comparing your prospects to those '0 to hero in 90 days'. Those are either bullshit or an extreme exception(which is what makes them post worthy). 
Make a blog called "noblog". Every entry is a link to a blog post and your thousand times shorter answer. Or better yet, call it "onelineblog" and give the solution written on one line!
I have created a template and saved it as .oft to my desktop. Afterwards I searched for dummy keywords which I inserted to the TO, CC, SUBJECT and TEXT field. I found all of them in plain text. I Altered all of them accordingly and saved it. Afterwards I could open it in Outlook to send it as specified. Hence, I suggest that you do not use any extra packages but just use file and string manipulation.
Another proposal - Move all of these templates directly into a self written python script for sending.

pipenv is for local development. Docker is for publishing an image which can be used along with a bunch of other images in a container orchestration tool like Kubernetes, or Openshift(Kubernetes wrapper by RedHat) or whatever container platform you want to use. Could also be simple like docker-compose or docker swarm. 
It needs work. For example it claims: &gt; str -&gt; float &gt; If there are characters other than plus/minus (+/-), number (0-9), and decimal point (.) in the string, the conversion won't be supported. but actually: float('1e2') # 100.0 float('inf') # inf float('Infinity') # inf float('nan') # nan float('1_1.1_1') # 11.11 Also: &gt; Only the types of float, str, and bytes are supported to be converted to int type, other types are not supported int(True) # 1 int(False) # 0 Similar issues for all sections. As-is, this article is wrong and overconfident. 
I love that they have tutorials with the data sets. Awesome :)
