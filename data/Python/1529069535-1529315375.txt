Just curious, approximately how much space would each Jupyter installation take if I had two different installations?
&gt;Obviously a bad idea since screwing with iterators while iterating over them is not a great idea. Very informative post, thanks. I certainly won't do that writing any real software. I was just curious if there is a way of doing it. Added formating, so anyone can save it as iterator\_hack.py and run: instances = [] class visiblerange: def __init__(self, i): global instances instances.append(self) self.i = i self.c = 0 def __iter__(self): return self def __next__(self): if self.c &lt; self.i: r = self.c self.c +=1 return r raise StopIteration def __repr__(self): return f'&lt;VisibleRange: {self.c}&gt;' print("instances before iteration", instances) for v in visiblerange(3): print(instances) print("instances after iteration", instances) 
Of course you can
Cheers - I know I did (not op) - I'd been wondering where this was.
Are you talking about '[SigSpoof](https://neopg.io/blog/gpg-signature-spoof/)'(all vulns get a name these days apparently). In th at case it's important to note that the vuln is dependent on &gt; the user has the verbose option set in their gpg.conf file.
&gt;can't do more than call next() on it. Exactly. I was interested if there is a handle of item from which python creates a generator to use in for loop. As explained in other posts, there is no such a thing: no handle for the original object and no handle for generator based on it. Thanks anyway.
It's a combination of like and favourite/save buttons.
I made a script that downloads songs in mp3 format from youtube and adds the metadata from itunes. All it requires is URL to the youtube video and song name. Also working on a script to get mojave's dynamic wallpaper feature to linux distros.
WIth boolean operators you need to consider the boolean value of Python values: # 0, +/-0.0 is False; other Numbers are True # None is False # Empty builtin container objects are False, such as empty lists, tuples, sets, dicts, strings, ... # The boolean value of user created ibjects can be defined and usually conforms to the "empty is false" convention. You can learn the above, and test it by calling the bool function on objects and checking the results. It isn't the same rules as C or C++. It is a set of consistent rules that help in determining the result of boolean operations on arbitrary Python types. 
New to python and have a question about the way the code is written. He keeps assigning variables to functions in a module, then appears to be setting parameter for the function with the variable. wn = turtle.Screen() wn.bgcolor("black") wn.title("Bouncing Ball Simulator") How would that code look if he wasn't using "var.par" format? Just wanting to know how it translates.
Thanks, im new and didnt know you could do that! very cool
How is this particular post related to Python sub? 
Sorry for the grammatical mistake :( s/is/has/
Because [pydoc has a special case for strings](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/d134809cd3764c6a634eab7bb8995e3e2eff14d5/Lib/pydoc.py#L1936) that allows you to do stuff like `help('keywords')`.
In addition, having to run help(str) isn't really a huge loss, because you're not going to glean much from the help() function that you wouldn't get from the Python documentation of strings and the countless internet references. Not really fair to point to this as an example of fatal inconsistency in Python.
I'm more thankful that we got to dive into the code and learn more about the `help()` function and all the code involved \^\^
But I'm pretty sure it used to work on strings as well!
Just FYI, this is a programming subreddit. There are people here who actually build those tools and have a far greater understanding of them than I think you imagine.
People like this guy - he did write the best unicode guide for python - even he has his faults like not understanding amortized cost :)
I want to learn how to make a reddit bot but I don't know where to start.

Interesting timing with the PGP vulnerability that allows one to sign for anyone else: https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/06/decades-old-pgp-bug-allowed-hackers-to-spoof-just-about-anyones-signature/
Working on updates to my site, [https://www.python-private-package-index.com/](https://www.python-private-package-index.com/), which allows you to create a cloud hosted personal python package index. We're adding a free tier which will allow users to create public packages only.
I'm well aware of the author.
Do a quick search.
As long as you don't abuse it, and don't for example solve hundreds of these captcha's per second, the server operators would never notice. I think that's really the important distinction here: the point of captchas is to prevent people from going crazy with automation, and to ensure that it's mostly humans doing things on there. If you're not abusing this, and are only operating within the constraints that a human would be able to, you would never have a problem in the first place because the server admins would not be able to distinguish your traffic from a human.
Смешно)
True, but at the very least forcing people to do it themselves keeps script-kiddies at bay.
Looks useless to me
I was surprised to learn recently that pip / PyPI has no automatic signature verification for packages. Anyone know if there's a plan to add that in the future?
That code is [17 years old](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/35cf0a3f90de8f2e3597e67701d1e03dd11a8cbe).
Fair enough.I suppose you have a better alternative for sending email.
This tool is really just a wrapper around azure’s speech to text api. I doubt google cares that much because they are focusing on recaptcha3. 
1. I used the wn object to draw the borders and yes i should have used wn.color() instead of turtle.color() So for background i added these 2 lines scrn = turtle.Screen() scrn.bgcolor("black") 2. Oh since i am performing the exact same task creating a turtle object and appending it to the list seems like a much better option. 3. Regarding your question i do not delete the collided food, just change its position. I know that the list will become larger and that's why i decided to only append to the list when the score is a multiple of 5. But i cannot add that part yet because the speed of the player turtle reduces on every collision (making it hard to reach higher scores) and i don't know why that is happening. 4. forgot to remove food_generator() - my bad! :/ Thanks for the reply. Here is the updated code along with the changes -&gt; https://pastebin.com/Qj6iZXC5 Do Tell On How It Can Be Improved :D
For sure I don't have a better alternative. Sorry buddy, I'm trolling you :-) I've created yagmail. I'm honored to see you suggest yagmail right next to "cron" and "json".
&gt; A bug in almost every popular implementation that existed for a decade allowed people to spoof most anyone. Any PGP signing across the last decade isn’t provably legitimate, which eliminates the entire purpose of pgp. First of all, that was a GPG implementation problem and does not affect the entire ecosystem. Second of all, if you had actually read the requirements for the exploit, you'd see it requires users to enable verbosity, which bloody nobody does. Third of all, you really should check your facts before you start acting like you know everything.
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/8it9o2/bottr\_a\_simple\_python\_reddit\_bot\_framework/?utm\_content=comments&amp;utm\_medium=user&amp;utm\_source=reddit&amp;utm\_name=frontpage](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/8it9o2/bottr_a_simple_python_reddit_bot_framework/?utm_content=comments&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage) That's what i used. If you want the code for a simple bot that just searches for a keyword and replies to comments within it i could send it, but it wouldn't be any challenge
You start by making small steps, start with making it post something. When successful you add something like making it reply to certain words or sentences etc. Or you could look at someone's complete bot and modify it to learn the logics. There is plenty of guides on how to make reddit bots on google. 
Well, I wanted to do some work on a netbook so I needed something lightweight which rules out a bunch of the big ones like eclipse (which isn't that heavy but is too heavy), atom, etc. I tried a bunch but they have various features or quirks that I don't like. For example sublime (which is what I use at the moment) doesn't support console input, IDLEX doesn't support the newer versions of python 3, a lot of the smaller ones are lack features (thonny), or don't work well with a small screens (geany). Many require too much effort to relearn, eg using vim. Years ago I used to have a nice setup with xmonad for my dev environment, but now I'm on windows... Ultimately IDLE had few flaws for what I needed. It just needed tabs and line counters really, maybe split screen but that's optional. I assumed it would be simple but as it turns out there's no information online, and even in /r/Python people have no idea. Sublime is not an ideal ide but so far it has the least problems. I'm open to suggestions if you know something light and minimal (and perhaps even MADE FOR python?!). I really didn't want to spend much time messing around with environment but such as python huh...
Here's where my lack of experience in Python shows: I do have `api_key = os.environ[‘API_KEY’]` already in my .py file that's running the script, but I'm kinda of fuzzy what's happening under the hood or \*why\* that works. Since I've already run the file, is that value now written to my server environment (in this case, my laptop) so that I can remove that line from my code, or does that line of code need to be placed in a different location? 
Haha nice. Good work!
Sublime has a package for console input. It's called Sublime REPL. I haven't used it in a long time, so apologies if you've already tried it recently and found it lacking.
so youre telling me trump is a neural network? :O
Ah, the os.environ code is safe to commit and make public. It’s reading an environment variable from the operating system. If the env var is not set an exception is raised. So that’s going to be a unique value depending on what the variable is set to at run time. I’m not sure which part you were uncertain about but if you want I can link/explain a bit more either specifically about the python call or env vars.
I'm thinking I'll just post what I have and remove any personal info, leaving comments on where I'm not sure if I'm doing best practice or not. Thanks! 
You bet! Yup, just leave any passwords/keys/usernames/etc as a default value and call it a day.
Meh. If showing an ID added so much to security then nightclubs would be the safest places in the world. PGP signing is not security. It just gives assurance that the computer is downloading the right package. 
Sometimes, some people wants to watch world burn.
Молодец)) 
/u/underrehtedTV7 can you move your code to Github. It will be easier for others to suggest edits and corrections for your code.
Why are you enabling bad actors?
&gt;CVE-2018-12020 affects vulnerable software only when it enables a setting called verbose, which is used to troubleshoot bugs or unexpected behavior. None of the vulnerable programs enables verbose by default So it only affects people who go out of their way to make themselves vulnerable. Got it.
Type: dir(greeting) 
Now that is a well written article.
I'm ignorant here but I am curious. What exactly is the point of checking that the key matches? If there actually is a malicious version of the package, and you are receiving it, then you could just as easily receive a bad key as well. It seems to me, to make a probably ignorant analogy, sort of like a bike lock with the number wheels, no one is gonna break is an reasonable amount of time, but what good does that do when they can just cut the lock off in 2 seconds?
The point is 1. that you downloaded the pubkic key for the author from another source, one that you might trust but don't necessarily have to because 2. you can look up the signatures saved on the key from other PGP users who have agreed, after meeting the person irl or online and verifying to their satisfaction that the person definitely owns and solely controls that public key, to put their own trust on the line for that fact, that trust being based on their own signatures from other users who have done the same for them. The web of trust is a neat idea, wish it was more popular nowadays.
setting the key within the file like you did doesn't always actually add it as an environment variable on your system; it tries to, but depending on your setup it might just literally add it to the `os.environ` object. this means that you can use it within the runtime environment, but it has to be set every time. what you can do is actually set an environment variable on your system (not through python) named `API_KEY` (or whatever) and then you can access that through python with `os.environ['API_KEY']` without needing to have the actual key in the code.
There is nothing wrong with sharing knowledge. 
md5 has never been an encryption technology. PGP/GPG remains to this day one of the most widely accepted ways to send messages between users (admittedly only a certain kind of user) and be certain that, as long as they've kept their private key in a safe place, they are absolutely the only one that can read it.
Np. Here's all the python win32 modules: http://timgolden.me.uk/pywin32-docs/win32_modules.html Three that i've found helpful so far are win32clipboard, win32file, and win32print.
This is great. Thanks for sharing!
which so happens to be how many, many popular clients use it.
Yup.
If you find yourself having to redefine what a captcha is, to allow you infer permission, you're probably about to have a bad day.
Isn’t this like saying it’s not a good idea to release programs like HashCat to the public? A secure system should be safe assuming people have access to the tools that might be used against it. Otherwise I feel like we’re venturing into the realm of security through obscurity. 
Embedding the YT inside a notebook took this above and beyond.
It seems this could be done with the __post_init__ method and a general purpose validator.
(narrator) *It didn't*
I don't see why this is over at r/Python
Then why do they still ask for ID's? And why would you gave up on that assurance?
I’m also new to Python, and wanted to do something similar but I just don’t know how to handle/integrate spotify api. I’m just not sure how to go about the access tokens etc, could you give me a hint about how to learn about APIs? Thanks!
This question gets asked a lot. Here's a number of discussions on r/learnpython: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/search?q=title%3Aproject&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all
I read "Shamir's Secret Shaming Scheme" at first. From what I can tell the code you linked is Python 3 compatible. 
Not sure what you're trying to get at here?
Can you post your code?
Well what’s your skill level?
Has been resolved.
There are some PEPs about possibly using TUF, The Update Framework. It's probably a lot of work, though. Verifying a signature is technically easy, but figuring out which keys should be trusted to sign which packages is much harder.
It literally says that the **programs that are vulnerable** don't use verbose by default. And further down the article it also says &gt;He publicly disclosed the vulnerability only after developers of the tools known to be vulnerable were patched. So if you're using a vulnerable program you would have to enable verbose logging, which it says explicitly is not-enabled by default, AND you would have to have an out-of-date version of of the program and choose not to update.
Thank you :D
Well I’m about expert 
The first time you get something, sure, but most people use software or packages over time. PGP keys are like HTTPS and certificate pinning - once the user has dealt with you once, someone else can't spoof you easily. That has value.
If you were an expert you wouldn’t be asking this question. You need to be realistic with your skill level and try to make a project that’s juuuussst above it so it’s still challenging. Try making a SQLite database package that’s thread safe. That’s a good python project. 
That post already mentions the problems with this, though: &gt; The fact that ten different Python modules will probably be signed by ten different PGP keys is a problem and I’m not sure there’s a way to make that easier. In addition, my key is probably not in your web of trust; nobody who you trust has signed my public key. These two issues (many packages by different developers, insufficient web of trust) together mean that PGP signatures are almost never a practical way to verify packages. And, of course, most packages have no signature at all.
How many Reddit accounts do you plan on creating to spam your YouTube channel?
All I was saying is that I have done a lot of python projects and have experience and I ran out of ideas ...
The SQLite project would be good. If you have a git repo for anything I’d be happy to review it for you. 
&gt; pgp is worthless anyway lol wut? How is it worthless?
&gt; A bug in almost every popular implementation that existed for a decade allowed people to spoof most anyone If and only if the user had edited their config file to include verbose logging and this bug only effected programs that called GnuPG with the `--status-fd 2` flag
There is already a project with a similar name, I think that was one of the reasons that is not QtPy https://github.com/mottosso/Qt.py 
Using IDLE: &gt;&gt;&gt; greeting = "hello" &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; dir(greeting) Will show you a list of methods applicable to ... from there you can, for example: &gt;&gt;&gt; help(greeting.upper) 
Ironically, I use that package. Devs in the CG industry do great stuff. mottosso has done a great job with that script when environments need both Qt4 and Qt5 support. 
Its really awesome!
the content is created using JavaScript. As your humble request doesn't contain a JavaScript runtime, the code needed to generate the content is not being executed. You can research web browser automation (packages such as selenium) to begin heading down that rabbit hole. Also might look in to driving browsers in 'headless' mode (Search the term).
Any help with getting the right proxies, so far I have only gotten success one or twice on my computer before I get ip blocked from using the audio to complete it. I tried using tor but that was also blocked so the only way around it is with a massive proxy list but the free ones online suck ): Have my own server but that is blocked too. Any advice or are paid proxies the only solution?
Today, in Friday, i was push on git my pet project for Django. It is debug tool for browser - Chrome and Firefox. And even fixed a little bit of bugs. You can see it my repo: [everbug](https://github.com/everhide/everbug). I'm happy :)
This is not security, this is an endless game of discerning human from bot on the internet. Sharing this code does lower the bar for entry which may prompt google to implement additional checks.
thats what python should be used for...automating human tasks and helping explore wider range of possibilities ...thumbs up
Thanks! I think so too.
Thanks!
Только пьянные русские до такого могут додуматься )
Well, for PyPI, PGP *is* worthless. PGP signatures for, say, Linux distro packages work (insofar as they work) because a typical Linux distro has a manageable number of people who are trusted to produce packages, and therefore a manageable web of trust and a reasonably small number of keys for the system as a whole to trust. PyPI... is wide open to the general public. How are you going to tell whether a given PGP key should or shouldn't be trusted to make a release ofr `foobarlib`? And this is not idle complaining; for many years I was Django's release manager, and I published signatures for every single package I released, and we had careful infrastructure with a public document listing which keys were allowed to sign a release, and we made sure those keys had a good chain of trust on them, and... I think in the entire time I did that, I know of one person who actually bothered to check the signatures on a packaged release of Django. The fact that we had to invent informal side channels for this shows what a bad fit it is for PyPI's model, and that you can't retrofit "just have signed packages" onto PyPI.
Please share how you resolved it. 
 grosses = (gross(s) for s in sales) [x for x in grosses if x&gt;300] Or [x for x in (gross(s) for s in sales) if x &gt; 300] There's no reason to ever use map, filter or reduce, they're slower and less readable.
I'd like to collabroate with you on this one, but the fact taht you are developing on Windows make this very hard - I get \`ValueError: embedded null byte\` error when trying to install requirements... :/
did you use pip or did it by cloning? please submit the issue on github and a screen cap if you want
Oh and I'm developing on windows because I have a crappy bootleg computer which cpu fan drivers only work on windows :( 
I wouldn't mind so much if the code wasn't so terrible. If I was doing it quick and dirty for newbs, put rock, paper, &amp; scissors into a list, take the next element or add 1 to the index, and wrap around if you fall off the end.
It's just an [api method though](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/generated/IPython.display.html)?
I don't mind going to the developer's site to get a public key. The people that really care about security will have local copies of the repos anyway.
The number of people who can and will abuse something like this that's already built is dramatically higher than the amount of people who can build it. This is also something I think should be kept private.
Hi! What about pandas or numpy?)
Use Beautiful Soap
look into Selenium, very interesting
I do not think that you will find it. But you can use anti captcha services for solve it. But, it is not a main problem. This services would be make a time out / limit request count. Soo.. you need anti captcha, few accounts, few threads and etc.
Building some sort of information website will get you working with a web server module, databases, and more.
Just started learning Python last month! Currently making a dictionary with lists/ chaining. Working on trying to remove collisions at the moment.
Yup, this is correct. I was reading this first thing this morning and didn't catch the `os.environ['API_KEY']` as the left assign. /u/throwaway42191 - unless you're trying to access `API_KEY` from your OS environment (another process, etc) you probably want to be assigning it to a python variable assuming you're expecting it in your python code.
Not really. The decision to stop displaying signatures was made months ago, as you'll notice if you click the link (to an issue filed in March, complaining that signatures had already stopped displaying).
&gt; Use Beautiful Soap for those squeaky clean htmls
Polishing a tool that generates random user data, adds the users to various product-related test accounts and then seeds the accounts with randomized shifts for each user.
I'm probably missing something, but the reason your code is executing immediately is because you're calling it here `loadMain()` Also might want to check out r/learnpython
I'm blind lol. Thanks.
I’d like to see something similar to HTTPS certificates. The python distribution comes with a master public key (or keys), with the associated private key owned by PyPI. (There’s no issue with the transmission of this key, since it’s sent with the python executable. If an adversary can modify these keys, they could also modify the python binary directly) Each package in PyPI will be signed with the developers private key, and each developers public key will be signed with the PyPI private keys. One issue is *when* PyPI sign the developers key. It could be once when the package is first added or it could be after the developer is “trusted”. It depends how much influence people are comfortable with PyPI having, as well as what “trusted” even means
I thing you should use a system function.
i tried using a cmd, i used a bat file but the only thing i could find was locking my volume at 75% as long as my computer is running but i want it so i can switch between 75% and 100% by binds on my keyboard or just by running the program

Since it's on topic(ish), I might as well ask here too. Is Pip 'safe' to use out of the box, or do I need to take steps myself? Are there any verification checks Pip does to prevent it receiving (and executing) malicious packages? I plan on using a virtual environment, if that makes a difference.
Lemme give it a shot
we’re talking about signing, not encrypting a message.
I knew very basic Python and am currently finishing up "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python." Very good modules in there and some good ideas to test your skills.
Check out this website: [Python 3 Module of the Week](https://pymotw.com/3/)
After reading your site I am impressed at this use of Python, and of the opinion that sock is a very silly word. Please add bubble chamber patterns and cellular automatosocks.
[Matplotlib Basemap Toolkit](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/) and [plotly](https://plot.ly/python/county-choropleth/) are the most used modules for county level data. Village level? I've never heard about it.
Probably have to be more specific about your actual tasks. I am trying to automate getting info from a sql database and doing some reporting off of that so you can definitely speed up mundane stuff. I’ve also been able to parse xml files from hardware that I need settings info from.
Pandas. Reads and writes Excel files. Not sure how it would handle formula in cells. But ultimately you need data in a readable form and use a database or python for your logic. That’s what I do. For databases I use Postgres. I’ve used MySQL and oracle but Postgres is the best, especially the latest stuff 9.5+ and 10. Great docs. 
So, your defining a function that runs a thread that calls the same function... And then you're running the function. Maybe there's something I'm missing, but your code doesn't make sense to me. When you call the function it's going to start the `threding.Timer` that's going to run the `loadMain` function that's going to run another `threading.Timer` that's going to run the `loadMain` again, and again... Maybe you could try something like this: def load_menu(): # load menu code here... def main(): threading.Timer(5, load_menu).start() # do more main stuff here, while the menu loads main() I think maybe you should read more about threads and ask on /r/learnpython, as the sidebar says.

Works for me on mac :P Use python 3.6+ because of f'string 
Was expecting Sock Club's domain to be sock.club... a bit disappointed.
I began learning python specifically for automating routine excel tasks. On the tasks I automated, I can easily turn a 3 hour task into a 10 minute task. It has been truly life changing. I recommend you start with “Automate the Boring Stuff”, it clicked with my non-programmer brain.
Oh, my mistake. I'm a reddit noob and, to be honest, I didn't really read every subreddit's rules. How can I re-submit it with all the answers, so it will benefit everyone interested? Is there a way to do it?
There are few reasons, I think. The most important is described in the CPython comments. Imagine ten threads, there one of them is constantly calculating simple math, and the others are working with the network. The CPU intensive thread has a big advantage because it's just faster to take the GIL. Network threads spend a lot of their time in the OS syscalls waiting for network I/O, so it's harder for them to take the GIL. That is why there is a switch condition that gives other threads a chance.
`not` evaluates the argument it gets as a boolean and returns the opposite. None is false-y so it returns `True`. `not 0` would return `True` and `not 1` (or any other non 0 number) would `return False`
Thanks! I was pointed to the ##learnpython irc and have been doing quite well there.
[Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) has pretty much exactly what you're looking for. 
[Found this.](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/379819/how-do-i-automatically-adjust-volume-according-to-the-sound-around-me)
\&gt; implying script kiddies have a major use for this Personally I don't have a use for this regardless, but it is interesting to see in the sense of "this is what it took to break down what the web now considers the best captcha". With captcha being a losing battle on the web, it needs to constantly improve. But I don't believe ReCaptcha has in a while. Maybe just maybe if this gets popular enough it will.
I'm using Pipenv for the virtualenv management and it has issues with parsing the requirements file correctly :/ But you inspired me and I took a shot at the subject myself :) Check it out: https://github.com/tadeoos/worldcup 
You should consider using a better pseudo number generator instead of the default one provided by Python (Mersenne Twister). The [PCG family](http://www.pcg-random.org/) has some nice ones.
it says 2.7 and 3.4 in setup.py and there's a commit in 2015 to support 3.4. so yes.
we need more sock related python scripts pls
Not a quirk: [The `global` statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#global). Also read the sidebar for information on how to properly formt your code so that it renders correctly.
Also a good one to try: import __hello__
Well, okay, but the consensus of people who actually build tools for secure software distribution and have a deep understanding of them (myself included) is that PGP is worthless anyway. If you have an argument, make the argument. If you have an argument from authority, actually talk to those authorities.
The last answer that uses a "default argument value" in the lambda is likely a fix for your situation [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4236182/generate-tkinter-buttons-dynamically](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4236182/generate-tkinter-buttons-dynamically) So your code would use a a lambda something like \`lambda myaccount=accountinfo: [self.click](https://self.click)(myaccount...\`
That's literally `import this`, not an awkward sentence.
ml? Im new to python, just trying to understand.
Machine learning 
If you're using https (you'd get a warning if not) then you aren't being mitm'd except by the NSA or someone with zero day exploits. Other than that anyone can put whatever code they want on pypi and if you "pip install nunpy" by accident, you just installed malware. Virtual environment is not a safety measure.
Basically the method for figuring out which terms are unusual/interesting. 
For a noncompetitive game Mersenne Twister is quite fine.
This post is better suited for r/learnpython
Long story short: pip doesn't really do much in terms of protecting you from malicious packages. Using virtual environments is safer insofar, as the `setup.py` (which can contain arbitrary Python code) isn't run with superuser privileges, but 'just' your user. Another way to do this is to use `pip install --user`, which doesn't install packages system-wide but just for this user. Just keep in mind that running arbitrary code with user privileges is still not great and there are many attack vectors for privilege escalation.
I have to test mixes of my company's product and some of the tests can range anywhere from 5 minutes to 3 hours of temperature readings. I use python to record the temp about every second and then write it to an Excel files with certain temperature milestones as well as max temperature reached and how long it took to reach. I just got multiprocessing working so I can take readings from all 6 probes at the same time. When I finish this other non related project delgated down to me I hope to add a gui so it looks a little better and more user friendly. I learned C programming at uni and the switch to python was honestly very easy and clean. I definitely enjoy solving problems with python. Honestly, I wish I had more things to solve using programming.
Dude I loved it! It would be awesome if you would make a pull request so we can add it to the other commands . But it is awesome! keep it up!
that's just the beginning of what python is for...
Haven't tried them myself but I've heard the "Kids Can Code" python tutorials on YouTube are really good (and not just for kids). 
Thanks for the sub. Ive been programing for 4-5 months but im still learning some tricks so that's a good resource and i'll direct later questions there. I'll check out that solution when I have time, thanks.
Does anyone even read the fucking sidebar?
I'd suggest using the shapely package for working with the regions. The Geopandas package can read a lot of these regions in and store associated data in a pandas like dataframe. Cartopy is a nice geographic plotting library to visualize these regions you're interested in. All of these packages have nice examples in their documentation as well. In general you'll need to get the database information from somewhere. Maybe naturalearth has something you could use?
My apologies for the mistake.
Don't think so.
r/learnpython and read the fscking sidebar(s)
I watched YouTube Newboston Bucky’s tutorial videos. That guy is really good. 
Python Tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU Best tutorials on YouTube I ever come across 
You might be able to use something like pywinauto to paste it automatically as well. https://pywinauto.github.io/ I've had mixed success with it, but it might be worth checking out.
I will check this out..
Location: anywhere I need a python programmer who is familiar with tkinter to code a high school assignment for me. I will give you a separate coded exemplar because i need you to code it in that specific way. You will be coding a simple tkinter gui, It should be relatively easy and quick to code, i would also like to be able to speak to you over skype so that i can explain the way i need it to be coded.

Try finding the track titles in the album and using the jaccard index to find closest matching song title in the playlist instead of just searching for the song.
Google for a "Python and Selenium" tutorial. You're going to be controlling a browser instance. There are methods in the API binding that will let you get elements on the screen and interact with them.
Tell that to __dict__ and all of the other variables that start with “_”.
It's probably not impossible, but it'll take a lot more work than I think you want to put into it. It'll probably be easier to learn how to write your own bot.
How about a gui that takes user input, searches the internet for a bunch of random photos and texts relevant to that input, then generates a powerpoint based on all of it and emails it to the user? Right there you've got like five or six different modules you'd have to use and a dozen more that you could use if you wanted to. Never done it, but it sounds like a challenging but possible test that would introduce you to new modules
Dude, don't make others do your homework. You'll remain a script kiddie forever.
Programming teacher here. I know when people do this, and it pisses me off. Turn in your own crappy work and take a low grade, or do nothing and take a zero. Don't turn in work you didn't do.
Short answer: yes you can. I've used it to process hundreds of Excel files and copy only the information I needed to new files, a task that would have otherwise required tedious (and error-prone) manual copy and pasting of each file, as well as to automate the process of going through several dozen folders and making copies of specific files to a central location.
Thanks is there an existing py script for discord to discord fwd that i can look into and possibly modify it ?
Yes, most likely it was converted using popular libraries such as pyinstaller or py2exe. You can easily find extractors for them, you just need to detect what kind of packer was used.
https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py This library wraps the Discord API to make it easy to use from Python. There should be plenty of examples in their documentation on how to write your bot.
It's pretty easy, actually. The main problem is that you can lose some information such as variable names because, typically, Python scripts are packed with `pyc` files only. All Python to exe packers works the same, they are using a special bootloader that unpacks an archive of Python interpreter and scripts in your RAM and executes it.
Yeah, but learning how to unpack the pyc files, reverse them, figure out what code is what because the variable names are gone, make the changes, and recompile is gonna be a lot more complicated than writing his own simple bot. And that's assuming whoever made the exe didn't use the option to encrypt the python files (it's not foolproof, I know, but extracting the key and decrypting the files adds another complicated step). And then even if he's successful, good luck trying to continue maintaining the code. Discord bots are easy to make. No need to reverse-engineer the wheel. 
if it's so easy and quick to code why aren't you doing it?
Its easy and quick to code for a someone familiar with tkinter, which i am not you wise crack.
You just need to remove all text except for print("Hello")
Im not making anyone, and i am not interested in coding.
Make me
Read the sidebar Post things like this in /r/learnpython Read THAT sidebar Don't post screenshots of code
Fuck off
Continuing my RESTful adventures with [requests](http://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/). I have a bunch of unfinished projects making use of public REST APIs and I just started another one, using the [Bungie.net](https://bungie-net.github.io/multi/index.html) API to fetch information on my Destiny 2 character(s). My goal is to eventually build an application to notify me when I've picked up better gear than what I have currently equipped, when I have upgrade points available, when I have gear I should dismantle or tokens I should turn in, etc. There is a ton of info available so I'm still poking through the docs, looking for interesting things to track.
Wait, he finally finished his update/rewrite? I'll have to take a look at it later.
Sorry :(
Thank you!
That. Look for an exe unpacker like universal extractor and see what files are available.
Worked well, thanks
Holy eff, now lets write a script in Python that purchases me a new pair of these whenever I have to throw out an old pair of socks.
Yeah, it's been finished for awhile now, he's been releasing a chapter per week free, or pay for the whole thing up front. At this point it's all been released. 
If this exists at least 10% of my socks per round will be cellular automatosocks
I'd be down to give this a try with a tool like binwalk if you send me the exe :) otherwise yeah probably just start over. RE can be hard as heck.
Read selenium documentation. It is really simple to follow. 
Yes I use it, it has a lot of problems unfortunately and you have to do a bunch of work to make it run nicely. IDLE already has a good console, I would have thought throwing in a few extensions would be easier, but like I said before apparently no one knows how to use it :P 
Trying to push high frequency log data (10ms) over a low bandwidth link using various compression strategies. Fun.
Hey, a while ago, I wrote [a blog post about weighted random choice](http://blog.bruce-hill.com/a-faster-weighted-random-choice/), and different algorithms for it, with Python code examples and visualizations to explain how they work. The algorithm used in this video is very serviceable for small tables of random events, but there's a really clever algorithm mentioned in my post and [explained in more depth here](http://www.keithschwarz.com/darts-dice-coins/) that is much more efficient for generating lots of weighted random choices from a big set of options.
So, as long as I don't mistype the name of the package and only install trusted packages, it's *reasonably* secure. Thanks!
Thank you for the information!
Thank you very much that fixed it.
I used a project called "decompyle" a few years ago to unpack a py2exe program, it was several thousands of lines long. After decompylation, I got my original source code back, _with comments_... 
I'm learning python and this is a great little example. Works well as below ;) wc18 --country=Italy Error: Invalid value for "--country": invalid choice: Italy
Pyinstaller removes original files and uses Python bytecode only, and I think it's better because it makes harder for people to use your code if you don't want to share it.
Jeeze. Calm down you melt. I was browsing on my phone and the side bar doesn't show. 
I got them all right, so i guess my intuition is aligned with python. Care to explain what you would expect them to give and why? 
Indeed. I stand corrected. It's _telling_ people to be respectful, open and considerate. Do you not think it is reasonable to expect people to be respectful, open and considerate in this SubReddit? How that's done and whether a CoC needs to be adopted/enforced for it is a question that comes _after_ this one.
Username checks out.
Should totally add flag emoji to that
That's sad to see. One thing that I've not seen made clear is that whether people disagree with structure being introduced (adding a CoC) or the contents of it (be respectful, open and considerate). Those are two very different things. 
Legal compliance. Usually, youth aren't legally permitted to engage in certain activities adults are, and the host is held accountable for those infractions. So rather than extensive policing inside the club by the club, they simplify the problem by preventing underage participants from getting in the first place. We'll, that and some places will hold on to your ID to ensure you pay your bill, but that's usally at time of purchase, not time of entry.
Unless you're on a network where additionally CAs are loaded onto systems explicitly for the purpose of MITM. Examples are various nation-state actors as well as corporate networks. You wouldn't think the corporate use case would be a problem here, except when the corporate firewall replaces or injects content to announce various error conditions. At that point, without object prevalidation, you can wind up with modified code (or code-like-or-not thing that _should_ have been code) further into your operational path than it has any right to be, grossly complicating troubleshooting.
Yeah, That was what I thought. Using Twisted might be too much overhead.
So when does Twisted/async come into the picture?
Yup, I have it done locally, gonna push new changes in the evening :)
Since you are going to install Anaconda anyway, just uninstall everything and install the latest Anaconda. 
Last night I was looking at Youtube videos and I saw a live python coding session where they were building a basic mental math. Program, where you create a random list and try to find the summation of those numbers. That was a good idea and I love speed math; therefore I coded one. The list starts with only 2 numbers and increase by one when you know 5 in a row. It fills the list with numbers ranging from 1 to 10. Later I will increase the range of numbers and also write this system in Javascript so I can play from my phone.
Hadn't really considered 3rd party verification, but that makes much more sense. Thanks.
I have a CS degree, work at MIT and use Python on a daily basis. That said, I'm interested in this course. I'd be in.
Was under the assumption that the PGP key would be changing with every update. I definitely see the value if it's static.
The are lots of API for it you can use any of them to get a hang of it. I have used this - [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot). Also see - https://github.com/DenisIzmaylov/awesome-telegram-bots/blob/master/README.md

I’ll happily rip out the code &amp; provide a write up if you can send me he binary.
I'd expect them to be commutative. That A and B gives the same result as B and A, always. But Python doesn't do this, which is fine, I understand the logic it uses now, so it's less likely to trip me up. I've internalised that 'or' is actually 'iftruthyelse' and 'and' is 'ifnottruthyelse' A or B -&gt; A iftruthyelse B A and B -&gt; A ifnottruthyelse B
I can see where you are coming from, but you're reasoning based on a flawed assumption. I mean you would also expect A times B = B times A ... which is true, if A and B are scalars, yet if they are matrices its not. and/or are communicative for booleans, but None isn't a boolean.
ProcessPoolExecutor uses the multiprocessing module, so it does IPC with pickle. If the sync lib mostly just does IO and is threadsafe, you might be better off with ThreadPoolExecutor.
The best tutorial is to Google Python tutorial and do the top 5. That's what I do to learn new languages.

I'm not sure why that would ever be the case - you use the same key and just sign the new file. You'd only change the key if it was compromised or you lost access to the old one.
Here's another [blog post](http://www.trivialorwrong.com/2016/09/26/random-integers.html) on this subject, discussing the Han-Hoshi algorithm, Radix-Based lookup tables, and the Alias method. It includes Python examples.
If the executable was created using py2exe, the scripts are extracted to a randomly named folder in %TEMP% during application execution, and are cleaned up when the application terminates. So open your temp folder, start the application, refresh your temp folder, find the newly created one, copy the contents, and close the application. Bam, sauce recovered.

I'm definitely ignorant, I was thinking that it was like MD5 where the key value is actually generated from the package itself.
Yeah, it's much closer to HTTPS and security certificates - you have an identity which is the key, and use that to sign your releases so people have confidence you released them.
I don’t do much with natural language processing, so I mostly hacked it together using notes from the blog post at http://brandonrose.org/clustering_mobile and some experimentation. Initially how it chose which tlds to show was going to use some complicated clustering math, but that didn’t actually work. So it kept getting simplified and now just uses a count. 
I noticed live scores is on your to do list so you may find the fantasy football API useful: https://fantasy.fifa.com/services/api/live/mixed Quick example to show where the relevant data is: def get_live_score(json): for match in json['Data']['Value']['Scoring']: if match['Status'] == 1 return match r = requests.get('https://fantasy.fifa.com/services/api/live/mixed') get_live_score(r.json())
As others have mentioned, I use python + pandas to do a lot of Excel/CSV manipulation and report generation. My [blog](http://pbpython.com/) is where I've written about many different scenarios for using python in a business setting. Hopefully it will help give you some ideas.
Have you looked into Proj4 or Rasterio? I’m somewhat of a novice python developer, certainly compared to most users here. I’m also not well versed in Cartopy or Basemap. However, I’m fairly experienced in GIS. My initial thoughts at a high level, and apologies if you know this already: the satellite image should be [georeferenced] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georeferencing), if it isn’t already. Once the satellite image is georeferenced with the correct geographic coordinate system (GCS - lat, long), you’re able to assign a projected coordinate system (PCS aka map or Cartesian coordinate system - x,y). Then you would assign the same PCS to your map frame, if it doesn’t automatically use the PCS of your data. Whenever data is transformed from GCS to PCS it is distorted. You’re taking a sphere and flattening it onto a 2D surface (Cartesian Plane or X,Y) which results in some kind of distortion. This, in effect, should rotate your image accordingly when you apply the PCS. GCS/PCS use certain units of measurements and will vary depending on which are used. UTM, for instance, is a PCS and will use meters for horizontal and vertical distances. In short, figuring out how to georeference and transform your satellite image should resolve your issues with either Cartopy or Basemap, assuming either of those two don’t require something specific that I don’t know about. Tbh, geodetics and geographic information systems (GIS) can get complicated and confusing for casual users. It looks like you’re heading in the right direction. Hope this helps.

Looks interesting!
Thanks!
Can you give me the 2 minute pitch for using this? Your example talks a lot about controllers and drivers and blogs... these are not my use cases, i haven’t returned anything expect a json response in a really long time (strictly api). The company i work for has front ends and back ends, the only time we talk is to discuss the json payload. In a world where we’re moving to more and more micro frameworks, where does his fit? From the little i’ve seen about this, it looks like “Play! framework” 5+ years ago.. Not trolling, not trying to start up anything, just really curious to know where do you see your creation fitting in?
I use cx_freeze to compile an app to exe, and can use uncompyle6 to take the compile source files to revert back to the original.
That's cool. Want to restart learning ML. Last time around it felt daunting. Maybe fun projects like these with simple initial implementation is the way to go. 
Sure so for that example of using an small micro framework API, you should probably go with a true micro framework. Masonite will not fit every use case. The use case Masonite fits extremely well are those side projects you need to start up and get going this weekend that have authentication systems, file uploads, user accounts, sending mail, running recurring cron jobs, sending web socket requests to your frontend, getting a front facing API and API authorization setup to connect to your application, getting billing payments setup with Stripe and I can go on and on. Masonite is great for that new SaaS idea you've been dreading on writing because of how long it will take. Masonite is a really incredible batteries included framework so if you need a stripped down version of something that just returns JSON then you probably don't need Masonite (although you can use it and just remove the service providers you don't need). We mention the drivers because all too often you need to quickly change focus at the drop of a hat on your projects so we implemented drivers which can switch from uploading to the file system to uploading to Amazon S3 with the change of a config variable (the driver config). So I see Masonite fitting in perfectly into the Python web framework world and honestly see a huge gap that Masonite fits into. A lot of developers are saying that they want a barebones framework so they can build it exactly how they want to build it and search for packages and find the best ones to add and rebuild all these features that Masonite implements out of the box like these Amazon S3 file uploads and database drivers and all of these features that Masonite ships with. Does that answer the inquiry?

That’s usually easiest. Start with something small and comcrete, then expand. “Ml” is a huge topic. It’s like saying “I want to learn video game programming”. Personally, I’ve struggled with most online resources not going over the foundation, and jumping straight to lots of math. 
Could you do a side by side comparison of this vs Django?
It preemptively answered mine, thanks!
I would say that doing it with an `executor` is not really porting the library, it's just a wrapper provided to program developers so that they can keep using legacy libraries. (Using the word "legacy" loosely here, because you can't really say that asyncio should be considered the default). As for it being a black box, it shouldn't be, as this is part of the standard library and very well documented. It is not documented exactly how processes/threads are spawned, or exactly how communication happens between them internally, and there is no need to rely on that in your program.
Sure I have a few articles I wrote about it but I'm in the middle of writing another to really disect the difference (or similarities) between the two frameworks. You can read one here on medium [https://medium.com/@idmann509/django-and-masonite-1-4-6f510430db76](https://medium.com/@idmann509/django-and-masonite-1-4-6f510430db76) You can follow the twitter handle @masoniteproject where we'll share any articles we write about it
:D
this would be helpfull
Can you showcase any non trivial applications that have been built with Masonite? Why would I choose this over Flask or Django? Specifically. What type of project would justify the investment of my time in learning Masonite?
Why not go on codementors and learn to do it, with some help? It won't kill you to learn it, and do it yourself. A tutor is more honorable than cheating.
Django IS a batteries included framework, literally everything you mentioned in that blog post is available in core Django or handled by very mature third party libraries. The Django docs are also unmatched.
Yes I've migrated one of my SaaS application into Masonite (I haven't deployed it yet because I have to migrate the user accounts from the old database still which has some outdated values). It's deployed to heroku but no database was setup yet for it so some pages crash obviously. You can see that application here though: [https://evening-ravine-84143.herokuapp.com/login](https://evening-ravine-84143.herokuapp.com/login) We've been so busy with coming out with Masonite 2.0 I haven't had time to polish that software. One of our contributors who works in minisota has one of their application running in production which he says handles very well. Maybe he can chime in here and explain that a bit when I see him online in Slack. I can't think of an individual project that would be worth your time but the speed in development of Masonite, the fact that it's extremely extendable, has automatic dependency injection, is completely build around an IOC container, assists in promoting great design patterns, teaching the developer about how the design patterns are implemented and great architecture for maintaining projects. 
Very true. Masonite is also a batteries included framework but Django doesn't have the ability to scaffold a project from the command line, or build an entire authentication system into your project by running a single command, or have automatic dependency injection from the IOC container or built around or have multiple drivers for the same features that can be toggled, or have built in task scheduling that can be tweaked to run at different times via a single cron job. That article is Masonite 1.4. Theres been 3 releases since so it's a bit outdated but the concept is similar. I'll let you know when I come out with a newer article.
Hey, can I interview you for a review for this course? A 15 minute discussion on the phone? You can stay anon if you want.
It does if you google the name of your Reddit app and “sidebar”. 
I did forget about that. But if my boss installed their own CA on my work computer, they also installed whatever malware they want too, including a system for adding new malware as desired, not needing to wait for me to pip install something.
I don't think you've justified your claims of faster development times. I'm always amazed at the things I can do in an hour with Django. Nothing you've said makes me think Masonite is going to speed any part of that process. And I'm always a little suspicious of IOC containers in Python. Normally they're introduced by {{ static_language }} developers who are too lazy to learn how to leverage the power of Python and dynamic typing.
its #pylint:disable=E1101
Masonite definitely doesn't fall for that trap then. The use of the IOC container is super powerful and the developer that have used it who have now become maintainers love it. If I haven't sold you on it then try it out and let me know what you think. I built a few projects with and absolutely love it. I've used a bunch of different frameworks and think the architecture of Masonite is just super awesome. Try it out and let me know what you think.
Hmmm... Why nobody's talking about logo? XD 
Actually just remembered, I have a bit of a testimony from the company using Masonite in production: \&gt; really easy to make things happen quickly So that could possibly speak to the development time.
You like? :D
lol 
Is the databases module in the right dir? Might need to check your relative import, maybe from ..databases.database?
Does Masonite support JWT authentication?
It seems like old Soviet logo of subway, very similar. But I dont like it. Sorry - tough, but fair. And it easy to solve. What is your original objectives? Why not Django and why did you need your own solution? 
So that should be out this weekend with the new Masonite Entry package release. I wanted to make sure Masonite 2 kept it's June 15th release date and there were a few things we squeezed in before that release. If you want to help contribute to that we can team up :)
lmao. sort of it lol. So the original reason for the project was to learn how WSGI application worked so it started as a weekend project. Then it sort of branched out into "well what if it had this built in which 99% of applications need?" and then slowly spread from there and then the architecture makes it super easy to test and I hit the TDD train and never looked back. It's really easy to make a test around something, implement that feature, ensure tests cover use cases and then push to the development branch and eventually merged in. I advertised it a bit on reddit a few months ago and a few people found the project and helped me design and build it and here we all are :) When using Django there were a few things I just didn't like about. All of them were really my own issues. I kept thinking it was weird doing it this way or the way Django does it. I completed my application with Django in a few months. I liked the outcome. I then got a job for a PHP developer position and got back into PHP. I learned Laravel and just loved the architecture of it. It was so intuitive and just worked well for my development flow (and millions of others) So when I was building Masonite (which it wasn't always called that) I started implementing these ideas and found that it worked really well with Python. I then just kept coming out with more and more features and now I and our maintainers just love the outcome. That's the answer to why I created my own solution but as to why Django, I'll be coming out with an article in the next few days that explains this more in detail then I can in this reddit post so I'll be sure to send you a link :)
I'm working on the first release of Vibora ([https://github.com/vibora-io/vibora](https://github.com/vibora-io/vibora)), an async framework (server/client) that's faster than Sanic and bring more features to the table.
You can read the Masonite Entry package documentation here if you are interesting in API's: [https://entry.masoniteproject.com](https://entry.masoniteproject.com) It may use some updates though. Haven't worked on it during the development of 2.0 but the installation should be identical to 2.0. Just have to make sure it works but it worked great with 1.6
&gt; Masonite is also a batteries included framework but Django doesn't have the ability to scaffold a project from the command line I guess that depends on what you mean by "scaffold." I suspect it's a definition that's specific to what you want. &gt; or build an entire authentication system into your project by running a single command It LITERALLY comes with authentication out of the box and installing any social authentication system is as easy as a `pip install` command. There's tons of back ends written for Django that work out of the box. Either you mean something VERY SPECIFIC for your own use cases or you've never even used Django. &gt; or have automatic dependency injection of objects from the IOC container This is mostly meaningless, so you'd have to elaborate. Python is not heavily IOC for a reason. I'm sure you're thinking of something specific but I don't know what it is. &gt; or have multiple drivers for the same features that can be toggled with a single code line change That's literally how half of Django works, mate, including for auth, templating, cache, database, etc.

There's tons of back ends written for Django that work out of the box.

Getting it to work with Amazon S3 was a good amount of configuration for Django. Masonite just needs the credentials in the `.env` file, a pip install and it works. Try it out. I think you'll like it. Go in with an open mind :) The Python community is not easy to convince. 
lol just try it out. Can't judge a book by it's cover that harsh and you can't hate something you've never tested out. One of the maintainers who is using it in production will chime in in a bit and maybe explain it in a different way
Can you update your article? I would like to see a really strong argument for this. Maybe it's more an alternative to flask than Django? Do you have a Dev site with api docs?
api docs as in the classes and methods specifically? No not currently but there are the developer documentation in the links above which you can use to decipher what you think the framework is more similar too. And yes I am working on the article now. I'll send you a link when it's done 
working my way through the Stats and Probability course on Khan Academy - stopping occasionally to do some simple simulations using Python.
here is a overview ├── rugby_app.py (what we run) └── databases(folder) | database.py (the database we want to use) I think that flank thinks it a module.
Need a model? $ craft model User creates a model class. Ahh, yes, I've always needed something to save me the time of typing: class User(models.Model): pass Again, this makes sense if you're coming from PHP where there's a lot more cruft in their frameworks that needs auto-generated (because most PHP frameworks saw what Rails/Django were doing and tried to copy them in that terrible language), but there's just not a whole lot of cruft to auto-generate in a Django project. \&gt; Django does not come with a fully working login and register pages and views and nor does it put them into your application for you so you can tweak them yourself. Unless Django has added these into the default apps it creates. It's literally pip installing a package: [https://django-registration.readthedocs.io/en/2.4.1/](https://django-registration.readthedocs.io/en/2.4.1/) There's a Django committee of developers who keep the core lightweight and make all these decisions, dude, and often move things out of contrib if they think it's bloating core. They decided this belongs outside of Django proper but it doesn't mean it's not there. The design of Django is that modules that integrate with the API are super easy to write, so stuff where there's a lot of wiggle room for what people want or if it's not universal to the mission that gets used from packages. I know that it's more convenient to have the packages YOU specifically want, but that's not a super awesome selling point, TBH. \&gt; This may be something you just need to use Masonite. I suspect it might be something that just Masonite needs. If you come back with an example, cool. \&gt; Not in the same way. Getting it to work with Amazon S3 was a good amount of configuration for Django. Masonite just needs the credentials in the .env file, a pip install and it works. Are you seriously complaining about the setup for using django-storages S3 module? It's like... I dunno 2 or 3 required settings? The idea that someone would complain about that astounding to me. \&gt; Try it out. I mean, quite honestly, there's no reason to and I CERTAINLY wouldn't pick up a framework that someone made just to scratch their itches around things they don't like in Django.
Ok. Masonite is not for everybody and if you think Django is better for your use cases then more power to you. Masonite solves my use cases perfectly and if it doesn't solve yours then thats great. We both have tools that work for us.
while the getting started is good and makes it look like a rails version for python I would love to see some API docs to fill in all the gaps before thinking about my next web app.
I'll keep that in mind. Masonite has been on a 1 month major release cycle from 1.3 to 1.6. Masonite 2.0 puts Masonite on track for a 6 month major release cycle so we'll have a lot of time to get all the other resources together like API docs, articles, video tutorials and all the extras beside the framework. I'll throw that on the todo list :) Thanks!
I'm pretty inexperienced too and don't wanna waste time so I hesitate to offer specific help, but have you tried using beautifulsoup and reading the documentation examples? Of course you don't have to use it (and I don't always), but it really did make everything a lot simpler. It might seem boring at first to read documentation examples, but it's really the fastest way to learn. [https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
&gt; Again, this makes sense if you're coming from PHP where there's a lot more cruft in their frameworks that needs auto-generated (because most PHP frameworks saw what Rails/Django were doing and tried to copy them in that terrible language), but there's just not a whole lot of cruft to auto-generate in a Django project. Ok? and? so then just make a file and type that in. Nothing is stopping you from doing that with Masonite. it's just a Python framework. The option is there to type the helper command but if you want to write the class instead them by all means go ahead and write the class. &gt; Are you seriously complaining about the setup for using django-storages S3 module? It's like... I dunno 2 or 3 required settings?. The idea that someone would complain about that astounding to me. not everyone has the same experience. In fact, a lot of people don't. The Django Slack group I've been running for last few years said they also had problems with it, as well as static files and a few others. &gt; There's a Django committee of developers who keep the core lightweight and make all these decisions, dude, and often move things out of contrib if they think it's bloating core. They decided this belongs outside of Django proper but it doesn't mean it's not there. Yes masonite does the same thing but instead has these third party packages installed by default. Just a design decision of the framework and a community choice from the maintainers. It does have a good amount of built in options which are great for making Masonite, Masonite which could possibly be abstracted away into their own libraries but it's currently not an issue.
I'm working on ShadowReader: [https://github.com/edmunds/shadowreader](https://github.com/edmunds/shadowreader) it's a Serverless load test tool that can replay traffic by leveraging AWS Lambda and S3

What's the purpose of this video if I may ask? It's not a tutorial of either sqlite nor tkinter as there's no explanation of either of those libraries. 
You run decompyle on a file and you get a near perfect .py file. The variable names are correct, the logic is correct, the docstrings are there. What's not there is comments inside the code. It's very much a time saver to run a python decompiler.
Do you have \_\_init\_\_.py file in your databases dir?
[xlwings](https://www.xlwings.org/) is a somewhat easy to use library to use Python and Excel/VBA in tandem. I like it quite a lot. E.g. writing Pandas functions to do various more complex tasks and then use those as mere excel functions from within excel (e.g. A1 = UsePandas(B1:H100))
yes i do but you don't need it
Hi, I looked at the article. It accesses this URL http://guzelsozlerblog.com/gunun-sozu but that URL doesn't actually exist. So it appears that the article needs to be updated. What kind of page was it trying to read? What it gets is a page containing: &lt;div class="content-container"&gt; &lt;h3&gt;HTTP Error 404.0 - Not Found&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;h4&gt;The resource you are looking for has been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable.&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;/div&gt; Thanks. HTH, Rich 
What are you interested in? Do you learn programming to solve riddles with algorithms in a clever way (i.e. do you have a math/science background?), or do you learn it for rather practical things (e.g. "I want to make a website")?
Thanks for sharing the code. Very helpful !
I’m barely starting to learn the science background so something more practical 
One of the uses for Django+DRF is for developing backends for both mobile and single-page web apps with Vue.js or React. So not much use for server-side templates and more need of support for REST APIs, JWT auth, websockets, and headless testing infrastructure. Any support for these in Masonite?
Yeah so Masonite comes with a Masonite entry package that handles full REST APIs, issuing tokens and token authentication pretty simply. Out of the box masonite has a built in "broadcast" feature that supports Pusher and Ably (as an alternate option for pusher) next is JWT for the entry package more testing support
I guess a very practical thing to do then is to try out [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). Doing things like this can be very overwhelming at first, as you will see many things you don't know mentioned in tutorials (networking protocols, database stuff, etc.) and you will get the feeling you are gluing this together that you don't understand. However, if you read the docs carefully and follow the instructions of the tutorials, you will eventually realize that these things are not so important, and that all the logic is in the python code you will write in these projects. There is also a huge community around django and web development, so you will probably find that most (specific) questions you have, will already have been answered on stackoverflow
Source? Cause thats something anyone could've said. Not to bash but if you want to showcase your framework you need something bigger than hello world.
Yeah he signed into slack and on his way home so he should comment in a bit.
Haven’t seen such a fitting name in a while. Jesus, dude. You must be a hit at all the parties you don’t get invited to. 
Run it from the shell and check for errors.
What's the actual task? I'd like to price it.
You can, but I'd delete the other Python.
You can PM me buddy. I'm far from being a python hero but I've done some webscraping in python myself before.
How many languages will I need to create a dynamic web page?
Little ambiguous but you likely need 2. A backend of your choice, like Python, and a frontend of your choice, like Javascript. Within these two categories you have a plethora of tools for: Python: Django, Masonite, Flask, Bottle etc etc Javascript: jQuery, React, Vue, Angular etc etc Masonite doesn't lower the amount of languages for a dynamic web page but it's just a tool for one of the backend Python options.
I'll soon come out with some video tutorials as we build a community around Masonite but here is the article so far. Be sure to leave a comment if you want me to discuss any other comparisons. Everything I could really come up with right now. https://medium.com/@idmann509/masonite-2-0-and-django-beb4986d967f
Here is the article so far: https://medium.com/@idmann509/masonite-2-0-and-django-beb4986d967f Let me know of any concepts you want me to compare. Everything I could really think of on the spot
Ok I thought I was the only one who thought this :)
The extracted list var a list of lists so only thing I needed to do was to make list2 = list[0]. Then I was able to use list2.index[4.340621948]. I'm very new to python and I only have background in matlab and very small experience in fortan90 long time ago.
People are being so picky and annoying. Thanks for making this, I love it! I was never able to get into Django because I always feel they complicate things. The philosophy is great. Can't wait to try the new version.

I'm just making terrible games in pygame, not very interesting.
Hey, cool project! I look forward to playing with this. Can you talk a little bit about why you decided to write another ORM when something as robust as SQLAlchemy exists?
[removed]
I didn't write it. It already existed and fit perfectly with the Masonite architecture. I honestly have never used SQLAlchemy but it is a Data Mapper ORM, right? I think Active Record style ORM's are just better. Have you ever tried an Active Record ORM before? I'd like to get your thoughts on the difference between them and your experience. If you have not used one before then you gotttta try it. It's much simpler to me.
This question gets asked all the time. I simple search of this subreddit will yield plenty of discussion. Also, check out r/learnpython. 
Thanks! Can't wait for your feedback. Let me know if you want an invite to Slack :) I think I've seen you comment on the other thread a while back. I haven't opened up slack yet to open registration but I can send you an invite in the DM's

Not to hijack this thread, but I did a lot of math and science courses along my my CS degree and I'd like to use that more. Can you suggest some cool things to look into along those lines?
Make a program that randomly generates program ideas. 
«primer on scientific programming with python» by the late Hans Peter Langtangen. Written for python2, but still worth it though. You find the pdf easily through google if you prefer that over a hard copy. 
It's not a textbook, but these days when I want to to learn something new, I take a course on Udemy.com. They have a number of Python courses, and you can usually get them for around $10 -- Just be careful to sign up during a promotion. The quality of the instruction varies, but the higher rated courses are excellent in my opinion.
Write module for calc big O notation by passed function. Enjoy! :)
Just FYI, Python is a real bad choice for any kind of real-time system. I don't know which hardware/architecture you plan to emulate, but you could run very fast into performance issues due to python abstractions and built-in data structures. 
Ah! Well I've learned a new thing today so thank you! I will check it out. I didn't realize there are fundamentally different models of ORM. SQLAlchemy is the only ORM I've used and it's always risen to whatever need I had of it so I've not looked elsewhere.
I messaged u
Will try that ty!
Start with Probability Theory and Statistics. 
I have a performance sensitive system based on asyncio and I need to add a new library to it. It’s not really a fun project, but rather something I need to finish ASAP whithout introducing a new bottleneck. Sounds like you had a similar project. How did the Executor-based implementation fare? Having an idea of how the library is implemented, rather than it being a black box, is useful for deciding whether it’s even worth building a prototype for perf analysis. 
Yeah it basically comes down to which directory the data is being molded to or from. For example, Data Mapper maps the model to the table. So the model should mirror the table in a way that they match. Active record takes the table a actually molds the model around the table by using the table schema. I preferably like the latter approach. This way I just have to maintain the database tables and all my models mold to the table schema automatically. Just personal preference I suppose. 
PeeWee offers ActiveRecord. PonyORM is absolutely sick - turns Python into SQL. PyDAL is what I like best having looked at all of them. I find SA's orm rather hard to understand. 
Hi Saam. Why don't you start by reading the sidebar? After that, read the sidebar of the sub that is recommended by THIS sidebar.
Fair enough, sorry about that. 
Udacity or edx or YouTube or download “think python, how to think like a computer scientist”. But most importantly learn how to use google!
F*ck the courses! 1 Open google and search tutorials with explains 2 Highly recommend Dive into python 3 Practice, only practice.
Sorry if I didn't make it clear in my post, I've tried looking for some online tutorials alot of them seem to just be short videos that are advertisements for other products. But thanks!

There is a bucketload of stats and linear algebra in deep learning (the new and exciting kind of machine learning I suspect you are referring to) but I’m learning pure theory on a platform called Peltarion (caveat emptor - I joined there in April). Now it makes sense to tackle interesting projects in pytorch or tf/keras. Before I was copy/pastin’ but nothing was seeping in... And a good first project in deep learning has to be pictures. Go understand some pictures. I was able tag music with different moods yesterday because they are represented as mel-spectrograms and a convolutional neural network with certain weird max-pooling layers are able to detect moods. Was working from a paper in July 2016. So awesome....
fwiw the wikipedia article includes python code that is commented as "being tested on python 2 and 3". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing 
What other frameworks did you take inspiration from (rails, laravel, etc)? Other questions, does it have authentication drivers? So could I throw jwt auth on some routes and session routes on others? Thanks.
It's the capital "W"; it should be `while`.
Nope, still says invalid, it's for both "w" and "h", and it is Which.
Check the preceding line &amp; block as well. If you write something like: if condition == True while True: do_stuff() The error will throw on `while`, even though the actual mistake takes place on the preceding line - the interpreter only "knows" about the problem once it gets to a character that's not the colon it's expecting, so it throws it then. If that's not it, then please paste both your code &amp; the error so we don't have to guess. ;)
It was inspired a lot by Laravel. I liked how laravel used the IOC container and automatic dependency injections so I took that concept and ran with it in Python and surprisingly realized that python implements that architecture a lot better than PHP does since Python can import a class and use it without calling it (php required the new keyword to use a class, python uses global namespaces to handle it differently) So which things like Laravel, it required service providers to be strings because it needs to cache them essentially so they are not all running on every request when they dont need to. Masonite gets around that a lot better with Python. Read the request lifecycle docs to learn more about that. I did read the docs for rails a bit to see how they did things and adjusted accordingly. But overall a lot of influence was from Laravel. It doesn't exactly having authentication drivers yet. That might be a good package to add on though. The Masonite Entry package handles a lot of authentication like tokens but it might be a good idea to implement something like that. The way masonite is structured, a single package can add features like that. You can open an issue and we can just discuss this. I'd like your thoughts on how we should go about this. It should be backwards compatible so it can either be a standalone package or we can add this into the next minor release
Building my first CLI app. It was inspired by this vid I came across on YT: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHV6nb\_4a-c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHV6nb_4a-c) All it does is take in a directory, grab photos from it, and smooth out the EV changes over the given spans between exposure changes in a timelapse. Need to test it more, but seems to work at the moment. Basically wanted to see if I could actually build something useable, as I'm relatively new to all this.
Sorry, thought I'd put an image up, so sorry, I guess it didn't go up. while True: print print("You have", points, "points left.") print \\ """ 1-add points 2-take points 3-see points per attribute 4-exit """ choice=raw\_input("choice: ") if choice=="1": attribute=raw\_input("***Wh***ich attribute?

I second what u/Mr_Fasion said about BeautifulSoup. It's fantastic for web scraping and parsing. I can take a look and offer my two cents if you want. I wouldn't say I'm an expert but I've been working with Python for a few years so I might be able to help.
Couple things -- * Thank you for pasting your code and not sharing it as an image * Please preserve the indentation in your code when you post it * Please indent your code by four spaces so that reddit will display it as code, like in my post from before * You are mixing some Python 2 syntax (`print "Hello"`, `raw_input`) and Python 3 (`print("Hello")`, `input`). Pick an interpreter (I'd suggest 3) and stick to it I ran your code and I'm not getting your error. However, it should not be throwing an error from your strings; it should be saving them as strings. If it's throwing a syntax error while reading your strings, it means it's trying to interpret them as code. Maybe you have a stray quotation mark somewhere...
Sorry, I'm new to all this so I'm bound to mess up, thanks for the help, I'll look around.
Thanks. This s a very interesting project and fills that middleground between Django and flask really well. Definitely going to take a look at the code and see i can contribute.
I can't find any quotation that could mess it up.
Wait, maybe I did, hold on.
Check out r/learnpython
Fixed, there was a stray slash, and then it was the mix of python 2 and python 3 that mucked it all up, thanks for your help man!

textboxValue is a string, you have to cast it to a numeric type first. You can do so like `float(textboxValue)`, but note that this will give you a ValueError if what's on the textbox can't be converted to a floating point number.
`conversion` is a string, which cannot be multiplied by a non-integer. Change that line to: conversion = float(textboxValue)*1.8+32

Executors work perfectly fine. I haven't done any sort of extensive performance testing or so, but it's not likely that the executor is going to be a bottleneck or anything like that.
Great, no problem! So it's running as desired now?
Why suspicious of them? I've been using Injector and I'm mostly happy with it. I find myself missing some of the nicer things that Autofac (C#) offers but it's been good to me. I don't feel like I've given up any of the dynamic typing benefits that Python offers and I get to decouple what I'm using from where I'm using it. 
Ish, that resolved itself, but I think python two and three still hate each other, I posted another thread about it.

I've never felt like I needed to add the complexity of a container to achieve IOC.
If it makes it any better, I like your logo. :D

Any modern framework should be async.
Sick in a good way or a bad way? Serious question.
It comes with a queue feature which has an asynchronous driver you can load "jobs" into and it will run that job asynceonously. These can be things like database updates or sending email https://docs.masoniteproject.com/useful-features/queues-and-jobs
Strictly speaking, you don't need a container for IOC. But it does make a lot of things easier. An example would be database connections, ignoring that Flask SQLAlchemy handles this for us, creating a session requires knowing the connection string, having an engine and using those to create a session or a session factory. If you're reaching out to a config object to get that or importing the session factory and statically depending on that, I'd argue that you're not actually doing IOC. 
Cool! Will definitely take a look.
Just wanna say, that's some nice us of D3. Very effective in conveying the messages.
I did what you said, but now I'm getting this: NameError: name 'l1' is not defined
Not really the same thing as async/await. Also, hard-coding class and method names in routes is not a very good idea. No decorators?
If you need an application built for speed in a way that you need a completely async applications then you shouldn't be using Python. You should use something like node
 A quick look on your code: 1. PEP-8 2. fst line - while answer not in ("Yes", "No"): - you should lead it to common case (smaller or upper case) and then after that compare them. 3. Code below... really hard to read without formatting. Would be better if your next post will contain link to github, for example
Hardcoding names in routes might be bad for other applications but it works perfectly for Masonite by just the way its built
What about debug or name of this module? #telepathists?
hey guys I made important advances , you can now see group stats as well as the soonest match! also I made changes to the code base to be more modular and easy to track changes (if there are any I hope) ,thanks for the attention , first time doing open source and I couldn't feel so inspired!
It changes control flow inside the client or server process. I only wanted to make the point that clients and servers operate independenly of their peers wrt async; each party is free to choose without affecting the other party. 
Thanks for the input. I agree it is definitely not the best choice for serious emulation, but this is more of a learning exercise and Python is a nice language to understand what is going on. 
How do you get night mode on Python docs?
Try disabling your extensions.
No shit. I tried that before posting captain obvious.
Yes, I think that's a reasonable expectation, where "expectation" describes an hope, not a prediction about the future. Have you used this subreddit under another name? I'm a little curious about why you'd be interested, given your apparent lack of participation in the subreddit, or Reddit in general. In particular, this http://archive.is/y8YE0 leaves me with the impression that the only reason you're participating at all is that you're wanting to make rules for a social place that you've literally *never used before* and apparently aren't even likely to use in the future. This seems like a really good example of a giant problem with CoC's - they seem to attract control freaks in search of a problem. 
In writing there is a concept called “[show, don’t tell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show%2C_don%27t_tell)”. I feel your post does a lot of telling but very little showing. I.e. you say a lot that Masonite is better in certain aspects but then often don’t provide examples that could prove that. Also, at the end in the comparison of the controllers it seems a bit unfair to use a function-view for the Django example instead of a class based view.
**Show, don't tell** Show, don't tell is a technique used in various kinds of texts to allow the reader to experience the story through action, words, thoughts, senses, and feelings rather than through the author's exposition, summarization, and description. It avoids adjectives describing the author's analysis, but instead describes the scene in such a way that the reader can draw his or her own conclusions. The technique applies equally to nonfiction and all forms of fiction, literature including Haiku and Imagism poetry in particular, speech, movie making, and playwriting. The concept is often attributed to Russian playwright Anton Chekhov, reputed to have said "Don't tell me the moon is shining; show me the glint of light on broken glass." What Chekhov actually said, in a letter to his brother, was "In descriptions of Nature one must seize on small details, grouping them so that when the reader closes his eyes he gets a picture. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

Fair. I completely agree. I'll update my post
The documentation is written in a show dont tell manner. I just hate the medium code blocks
I have just had an idea for a new, small pet project. I think I could do it myself, but it might be more fun to collaborate. Scope would be web crawler to a specific source creating sheet music via MXML. I have done zero on this yet, but if you're interested let me know. Other advice I've been given. Think of a tool you wish someone would make for you. And then go and make that tool. For example, think about the question you've just asked. Do you think others are asking that same question? Go make a project idea generator.
Not trying to be a dick but this is all so... vague. Can you give one solid example of why anyone would ever use this over Django? Not like "Django handles their models in a weird way I don't like" but an actual concrete example? I think it's cool that you've made this but it seems disingenuous to tout it as a viable alternative to established frameworks but not be able to speak to WHY it's worthwhile.
Valid points. Honestly I'm not sure if I can say that you should use this over Django. They are extremely similar but Masonite has a different way of doing the same thing and it all comes down to preference. I and a lot of other devs really like it but if you dont like how it's done in Masonite and like how things are done in Django then I won't be able to convince you. It's hard to explain all of that in an article but I suggest to take an hour out and build a blog or something and then see if you like it. Not sure if I can take the time and convince everyone. I think you just have to try it out and see if the flow of Masonite is something you enjoy over Django. I'll be coming out with a tutorial on building a blog with Masonite soon that being can just sit back and watch and see if they would enjoy it
If you want more code examples I suggest to read the docs on a few concepts and see for yourself how they compare to django 
I have my fingers crossed that this isn't just another framework that allows you do to do anything as long as you do it their way. 
🤞
Yes, I can do that. 
&gt; i haven’t returned anything expect a json response in a really long time (strictly api). The company i work for has front ends and back ends, the only time we talk is to discuss the json payload. Kinda off topic but I'm curious about this, can you expand a bit? What framework, API framework, ORM, etc. do you use? Do you not do any server side templating?
Coursera has a number of good courses on machine learning. Andrew Ng's course starts with the basics, I used it when I was starting out ( Like you, I also have a C and Python background)
That is a great blog!
You need to bind l1 to class, add `self.` everywhere you use it.
I'm not sure about the grounds, but you can still used it if you're logged in.
Congrats on graduating. I too have a degree in mathematics and actually had a hard time with programming in college. But getting the formal education in analytical thinking made a second look at programming much easier. I studied “math they don’t pay you for” in college, but then went into R&amp;D. My advice if you can do it, try to learn on the job. Don’t discount your degree when applying for jobs. You might find some organizations may appreciate the math skills you bring. Language and syntax can be covered in a short period of time. Critical reasoning takes about four years, full time, in an academic setting.

SQLAlchemy author here. Just FYI I don't really know what "data mapper" vs. "active record" means today, other than, an API that stresses an enclosing transaction around the objects, vs. one that looks at each object as an independent document. "data mapper" vs. "active record" used to mean that the object model was declared entirely separately from the table definition, with the idea that the persistence of the model could be anything, just happens to be a database. SQLAlchemy started out with this goofy mapper()/Table/your class concept to try to stress that. But it was bogus; the structure of the class was still modified to have attributes representing the table and the program therefore still assumed database details explicitly, so there was no completely transparent firewall between the object model and the persistence of it. Even Hibernate moved from having an XML mapping file to using inline annotations on class definitions. So I replaced mapper() with Declarative which is what everyone uses now. I don't really understand what your statement "molds the model around the table by using the table schema." means vs. "maps the model to the table.", the latter (data mapper) actually sounds more restrictive, which is the opposite of the reality for SQLAlchemy vs. other ORMs where SQLAlchemy allows \*way\* more flexibility in how the class and the mapped table can differ from each other than any other tool. This is not the first time someone's description of data mapper vs. active record confused me, so I'm just trying to figure out what the perceptual issue is here. As far as I can see about active record, the main thing is that it seems to lack a unit of work pattern, meaning, you say [object.save](https://object.save)() and it emits an INSERT right there - this is a big difference but has nothing to do with how models and tables associate to each other. And then, there is usually in active record a configurational pattern that tries to hide the fact that we're talking to a relational database, using some kind of minimalistic declaration system that attempts to assume no knowledge of SQL, which makes much stronger assumptions about the underlying tables such that they tend to have to follow strict patterns, like Django's infamous "no composite primary keys" issue. But these configurational limitations are not a hard black and white difference, they're along a spectrum. Anyway, I don't know what "data mapper" really means in practical terms in this decade and I think as to why someone likes one ORM or the other they should come up with more specific reasonings.
Try [formatting your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F). You should also post questions like this in /r/learnpython.,
Hustle until your haters ask if your hiring ;-)
When you declare a variable it only exists for the scope you made it in. In this case it only exists inside initUI. This is true for any python class, regardless of Qt. To access it elsewhere, set it as self.l1 and access it as self.l1. The self word here puts it on the instance of the class. That's why you access all your other qt elements here with self, because they've been on the instance.
Please take these to /r/LearnPython I suspect you're new to python and jumping in to the deepend with pyqt. Take some time to learn the python basics as well before applying qt on top of it. The errors are very clear here.
If pgp is worthkess we might as well remove it from Linux repos and save many hours of work, right?

Hey Saam, Glad to hear that you're starting to learn python. I too have started to learn Python as it is simple yet effective programming language and I also must confess that I have a little hands-on experience with python. There is a no golden goose to chase here for mastering python but to practice, practice and practice a lot(in the three months you got). I can see that you are bored to listen to some instructor on YouTube but let me tell you that this how it all starts for most of the programmers/coders at least in the very beginning. In achieving your goal you might need these: 1) Purpose, as in why you want to learn this. If you don't have one make one else you'd be wandering in the python jungle without any sense of direction. 2) Tutor, as per my opinion 'Sentdex' is the best tutor on YouTube for python. Videos are precise and clear. Best part is he stresses on implementation rather than plain blabbering. You can also try Corey Shaffer 3) Application, what do you want to build from the tools you got? All the very best!
Masonite actually originally came with peewee before we switched to Orator lol. Good package.
I'd never heard of Masonite before seeing this post. I just finished the "blog" example and overall there's a lot to like, but a fair bit that I don't like, as well. Plus: * Super easy to get started. * I love the command line tool to easily create new routes, controllers, etc. * Strong authentication is a first-class citizen here. It almost takes more work to ignore it than to use it. * I like the opinionated layout. Overall, things are pretty easy to follow and parts of the application feel neatly sectioned. Minus: * Adding to `builtins` really ignores the "explicit is better than implicit" part of Python. It also gives me a nasty red line in my editor (PyCharm) that makes me feel like I did something wrong. I'd rather just import something. * To add on to that, there's a lot of implicit magic just floating around, espeically in these helper functions. The difference between `request().input('id')` and `Request.input('id')` in the example [here](https://docs.masoniteproject.com/the-basics/helper-functions#request) is significant and the former seems to make it much harder to test your application's behavior. What if you want or need to insert a dummy / mocked request into your handler? * Stylistically, I don't really like the function calls that give me back an object, like `auth()` being a shortcut to `Request.user`. I'm not sure what it is, but writing a line like `user_id = auth().id` just feels weird to me, but this is more a silly gripe than anything else. Overall, I guess my main thought is that if I inherited an application that depended so heavily on custom behavior and configuration injected into the language and application, I'd probably be kind of pissed off about maintaining it. And, if someone new to Python started out by using Masonite, I'd be concerned that they would be more learning how to write a Masonite web application, and not how to write Python. That said, I will probably give this a shot over Flask the next time I need to build a non api-only web app. There are a lot of options with how extensible I know how much work goes into a project like this and I appreciate it. Thanks for that! 
Ubuntu? Install Arch Linux and set VIM to work with Python, do you accept the challenge?
It's a tool to put in your toolbox, just like any other. 
&gt; Adding to builtins really ignores the "explicit is better than implicit" part of Python. It also gives me a nasty red line in my editor (PyCharm) that makes me feel like I did something wrong. I'd rather just import something. you don't have to use it. Those are just helpers. You can resolve them from the container: ``` def show(self, View): return View('index', {'key', 'value'}) ``` Remove the HelperProviders completely if you don't want any. &gt; To add on to that, there's a lot of implicit magic just floating around, espeically in these helper functions. The difference between request().input('id') and Request.input('id') in the example here is significant and the former seems to make it much harder to test your application's behavior. What if you want or need to insert a dummy / mocked request into your handler? Your correct, if you want to test you should go with this option: ``` def show(self, Request): Request.input('id') ``` Then you can import that controller and mock the Request object. &gt; Stylistically, I don't really like the function calls that give me back an object, like auth() being a shortcut to Request.user. I'm not sure what it is, but writing a line like user_id = auth().id just feels weird to me, but this is more a silly gripe than anything else. Yeah then you don't have to use it lol. Some parts of Masonite are shorthands that are added via the HelpersProvider. Take a look at that provider in the code to see what exactly it is adding: https://github.com/MasoniteFramework/core/blob/2.0/masonite/providers/HelpersProvider.py Thanks for your feedback! I'm glad you like it. Let me know more of your thoughts as you (hopefully) keep developing with it :)

You need to make `l1` into a `self` var. So when you first initialize, call it `self.l1`
Wow, I planned to do something like that with C#, but couldn't due to excessive amount of coursework/test/lab exams going on around me. Say, is using Flask solely enough? Or would it be better to resort to Django if I wanna go hardcore?
Just start writing Python, and you will get your answers in the process. The experience for every person is so individual. 
Yes and completely failed. Am going to give it another go shortly!
&gt; I'd rather just import something. If you really like importing but also want the dependency injection and IOC container then you can resolve by annotation. This is what I use in my applications: from masonite.request import Request def show(self, request: Request): request.user() ...

I know a lot of people keep saying to learn the logic behind ML, and while it's extremely useful info, unless you're going for a PhD in ML it's almost over kill. My suggestion is to find something you want to build. Your own idea. And attempt to build it. You'll most likely be required to combine mutilple types of classifiers which will expose you to the majority of the ML world. There are a million examples of ML stuff and you can pick and choose different parts from the web and explore the outcomes. Like right now, I'm clawing my eyes out trying to build a multi-label R-CNN classifier that feeds into 2 more CNNs. Although I have a general understanding of what it's doing, I couldn't show you the equations that govern this stuff. But through exposure you just start to understand.
Hey, thanks for the quick response! I realized I didn't fully finish typing out my response before I sent it (my last paragraph is a little weird) but it's late here. Anyway, thanks for pointing out that I can just remove the `HelpersProvider`, I will probably do that to make it feel a little more comfortable for me to write. Is there a github repo for the `craft` command line utility? I noticed some odds and ends that I'd like to open some issues for.
Don't use `for i in range(len(iterable))`. If you want to iterate over something, you usually want to do something to the actual elements, which you can do with `for thing in things`. If you specifically need the indexes too, use `for i, thing in enumerate(things)`; this returns an (index, element) tuple at each iteration. Don't use getters and setters, just access and assign attributes directly. Learn about list/set/etc comprehensions, and you'll barely need to use for loops ever again. Learn generators while you're at it.

I recommend reading "Effective Python". Reading it now. It gives you a rundown of the language.
This looks perfect. Thanks for taking the time to show me! 
There is an overwhelming amount of resources and approaches to learning it. I've burnt myself out multiple times going with the bottom-up approach (math and theory first). I personally can't stay engaged that way, it's too dry for me, even though it makes sense to build the foundation first before you jump in. In practice it doesn't seem to work out for me. So I am going with the top-down approach right now (jumping right into code, example projects and figuring out how and why things work piece by piece as I go). You have abstractions over the more in-depth libraries to get you started (ex. tflearn over tensorflow). Even though in the start there's a little bit too much copy paste and some impostor syndrome type of feelings, it's keeping me engaged and I'm making more progress than I was when cramming linear algebra, calculus and stats without a context. Plenty of people enjoy that though so you just need to find your own way, but be aware that there are different approaches you can take. Getting a strong math and python foundation before jumping in makes the most sense in theory, but if it burns you out and demotivates you, it's not the only way to go, but keep in mind that you can't really escape it as machine learning IS math. What you can do though is jump in anyway, accept that there will be a lot of "black boxes" in your code which you will get around to learning as time goes by, but applying the already existing tools is fun and interesting, so you are more likely to work through the black boxes eventually, at least more so if you try to begin with them without any context.
Thinking about it more, I think it's actually a huge boon to your framework that those helpers are added in through the actual architecture of the framework instead of as a built in requirement. I really really like that, thanks again for pointing it out. I will definitely be giving it a shot! 
Thanks! I'm glad you like it. Maybe I should make that more clear. Not sure how many people will like the builtins.
Dude i made the same script, but how do you add the metadata from itunes?
What are you using for this, faker?
it's definitely not a tutorial but here i m trying to show something which I've made and that's it . The code is not that clean but it still works and it's for those who are intermediate in python (not experts /pro) 
thanks 
I hace always had problems with the math, but never found a way to learn it, is frustrating af, any recommendations?
Matplotlib is pretty versatile for visualizing data. Apparently they have an animation library too: https://matplotlib.org/api/animation_api.html. I haven’t used it before, but it’d be a good start. If you’re new to python you might get more help at r/learnpython.
This particular topic confused me alot while i was learning python so after learning why not make a video about it and share

Try out the reddit API, or more specifically the PRAW (python reddit api wrapper) library for it (documentation: http://praw.readthedocs.io/). If you mess around on reddit a fair amount, it might be fun to play around and learn about different aspects of building something in the process. Basically it's like accessing all reddit has to offer from a programming environment and use/store the data. You can iterate through subreddits, submissions, comments, users etc. with it and make use of that, even listen for new submissions live. You could also build a bot with it that listens for and responds to certain type of comments, but that's a step further perhaps, so start with maybe just grabbing some comment data of a subreddit youre interested in and find some other cool little libraries to process the info you gathered with in some way. It's a lot easier than it seems at first, get comfy with the docks. If you search reddit bot or praw or something on youtube, you can find some quick videos that give you an idea on how to get started with the authentication and the examples in the docs are super helpful.
any github links????
I would love to, but atm not possible because of too much work. Sorry, maybe after 15th july.

so should i take the udacity machine leaning course? 
Python wouldn't really appeal to a mathematician as a subject, perhaps as a tool for working with some other subject, but in and of itself, Python is too random and unsystematic. I've read "The Haskell Road to Logic, Maths and Programming". It's written more as an introduction to mathematics, rather than programming, but it does so by means of programming. I think, although this is never stated in the book, that the author might be one of those people who are into univariate foundations of math / homotopy type theory--again, something to look into if you are interested in both math and programming. In general, in my experience, people who come from mathematical background tend to feel more at home with languages from Miranda / ML family: Haskell, SML, OCaml, F#, Clean etc. because it resonates well with ideas they are used to from abstract algebra / group theory etc. Of course, different areas of mathematics found expression in different languages. So, for example, Prolog and family would be more interesting to someone who's into logic and proof theory. If you are into numerical methods, then the closer you can get to the hardware the more you'd enjoy it, so C or Fortran might be good for you.
As an alternative, since Django can often be too big of a bite at first with it's 'everything included' design (which on the other hand I suppose can be a good thing as well), Flask is a good alternative with it's "only what you need" design which allows one to get a basic site going in no time and then add features and learn them one by one without having to handle everything at once.
A combination of [Mimesis](https://github.com/lk-geimfari/mimesis), the [randomuser API](https://randomuser.me/) (for grabbing profile pics) and some product-specific bits I wrote to fill in the gaps and create user work shifts.
I'm pretty much in the same boat, it's really tough if you don't have a strong math background from school/college/uni. There are countless resources though, it's the discipline and persistence that everything rides on. I find it really hard to create a positive feedback loop with math studies at home, which is something you really need to keep it going. I recommend trying out machine learning with the top-down approach and in the process understand what you don't understand and that way build a better understanding of what and why you need to understand. I could spam you with resources if you want, from courses to books, but honestly lack of resources is not the bottleneck by far here, it's self discipline.
I can see your framework influenced a lot from Laravel. IOC, Migration, etc. But in my opinion, The laravel Migration/ Model is very limited, and hard to remember Model's Field name. I like the way Django defining Model's Field.You can build Form Model automatically. 
&gt; Have you used this subreddit under another name? Nope. I made my intent for asking these questions very clear in my first post here - "I'm only trying to understand why you feel that PSF's Code of Conduct can't be practically enforced here.". At no point have I said that this community needs a CoC or anything along those lines. &gt; you're wanting to make rules for a social place that you've literally never used before My first interaction with this community was extremely negative and that's the reason for my reservation from _any_ further participation. My participation in this thread has merely been me trying to figure out why it was so. 
driver = webdriver.Chrome('https://secure.consumerreports.org/ec/login') That there is wrong. Use: Driver = webdriver.Chrome() Driver. Get("https://..") 
As always, it depends. I like to use Flask because it gives me lots of freedom in what kind of code I write; Django feels rather strict with its rules. Both scale just fine. I suppose it's really just personal preference. Flask doesn't have a "batteries included" approach, though, which I like as this is solely for learning new concepts.
oh
Hmmm, i am not asking a question about the language i want your opinion about the code should that also be there ?

However the course is very good. I personally bought it.
As you have (and will) hear from others, this question really should be in [r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/). That said: 1. though it seems this is a losing battle, it's a "program", and **not** a "code" ... code is what you write to make a program, you do not program a code. 2. while it's admirable to try and use multiprocessing, trial division is a painful way to test primality, and trial division spread across multiple processes is just agonizing... as is if your number is sufficiently large to use all your procs, but also divisible by the first value in the first group, all the procs will be engaged for some amount of time doing useless work. 3. anything named **isprime** should *probably* return a Boolean. 4. generating lots and lots of fixed length lists is extremely memory inefficient, consider tuples.
So I actually made this switch about 2 years ago and this was the most helpful thing i found. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0 I also watched alot of the pycon talks, and read lots of python to find all the cool shorthands for stuff. Also be careful wheb watching and reading stuff that it isnt about python 2, (this tripped me up the first month more times then i care to admit).

How the heck do you think the GPL works? Raising an exception that tells the end user to uninstall an extremely limited subset of (possibly but not necessarily) GPL licensed modules from their PYTHONPATH wouldn't appear to accomplish any goal of inoculating against the GPL's copyleft provisions.
This appears like it should be in [r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/), but it's also pretty unclear what you're asking for help with to begin with. You should include an example of what code you've attempted.
Python can really do anything nowadays... Which module does this?
Decompyle works on pyc files.
Make a game like hangman.
Yes, that seems reasonable. There are much more secure and better alternatives, but people stick with PGP because everyone else uses PGP, and nothing gets better. (Again, would you like to make an actual argument, other than an argument from authority? If you're going to make an argument from authority, remember that I literally have PGP-signed packages in Debian, have maintained PGP-signed private Debian repos at various jobs for the last ten or so years, have organized multiple PGP keysignings, etc.)
And does this module work with every human or is it specifically designed for indonesian women?
Qtpy is a compatibility layer for pyqt4/5 and pyside/2. It's developed by the authors of Spyder.
By PYTHONPATH you mean Miniconda installation or what? But you are wrong. If the app cannot run with GPL modules then it cannot be considered a derived work from that particular modules. Thats plain simple. May be I sused a bad wording: infecting in this case is simply a GPL violation (if you distribute the GPL infected code under another license). There is a quite inspiring reading about GPL corner cases: [Re: Linux GPL and binary module exception clause? by Linus Torvalds](http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0312.0/0670.html). The problem arised from PyQt that is licensensed with GPL + Riverbank exception and MIT/BSD licensed modules like matplotlib, enaml, qtpy, pyqtgraph (that exist because of the Riverbank exception) from one side. And from the other side from conda dependencies of mentioned packages and the fact that such packages have their own ways (I counted at leas three!) of switching from GPL PyQt to LGPL PySide. So if you simply create conda environment that depend on pyqtgraph and matplotlib you get PyQt installed. And more, if you don't prevent such modules from using PyQt they would use it. And it this case your app might be considered a derived work from GPL PyQt. It would be nice if such modules had only one way of switching backends... But even in this case it's better to be **sure**.
Wow, thanks! I'll look those up on YouTube when I get home. Thanks for taking the time to write a detailed explanation! 
Sir, this is IHOb...
Well, no, I'm not wrong... IANAL, but I've spent a decade or more working with very expensive lawyers who are very intent on being clear in this area. What's installed on the machine running the work has no bearing on whether or not the GPL's copyleft clauses have been implicated by that work. Python (including the one wrapped by Conda and its variants) will import any module that appears in a directory listed in the PYTHONPATH environment variable at runtime; your check is only determining if those modules are installed somewhere on the user's system that's on their arbitrary (ie not managed by miniconda) PYTHONPATH. So your app.py check will indicate a license conflict even if the user is running an app that is in no way using any of those modules, but merely could in theory. Which has nothing whatsoever to do with how the GPL works. The GPL has no meaningful relationship to what's installed on the system running your code, but only on your code if it incorporates the GPL licensed work directly. So if the app your user is writing *relies* on PyQt, then it's *potentially* GPL "infected" -- they may have a commercial license, which is an edge case you're completely ignoring -- and your check *may* be valuable (though they should already know the GPL has been incorporated by their actions), but it would wrongly indicate a license issue (and also suggest a very bad solution to that false positive) if your user's app did not incorporate PyQt at all but they did have installed any number of PyQt apps on their development system by any number of means.
If you need to update a 2D array (a table) with any degree of uncertainty, then you should consider using SQLite3. It can take care of much of the logic for you.
I’m positively CPU-bound. I/O doesn’t come close unless it’s blocking. 
I still insist that you are wrong (after all you are not that expensive lawyer yourself) - the problem is in the gray area as Linus named it. And it's all about which backend (GPL PyQt or LGPL PySide) that mentioned modules (that are derived works from PyQt but have MIT/BSD license) use. I assume the situations when your code do not import directly from PyQt but it imports from like enaml/qtpy. So it _might_ _rely_ on PyQt (it depends on that mentioned modules behavior). Preventing running the app on python that has installed PyQt prevents that mentioned modules from _relying_ on PyQt (that's for sure - there cannot be specualtions). So this guarantee that your app does not _rely_ on PyQt. 
Oh ok, well in that case I guess it might be worth evaluating the performance.
/r/lostredditors
Make a reddit clone with Flask, have it use an SQLite database with functioning login systems and repost this thread there.
Sure, don't take my word for it, but please talk to one of your own expensive lawyers, because I first read what Linus wrote there back in 2004, and none of it applies to this conversation (just for one, there's no binary inclusion involved). Your check still would prevent the user from running their app on any machine in which PyQt was installed, regardless of whether or not *either* their app *or* any of their app's dependencies incorporated PyQt. *That* is why the check isn't very useful, because it will generate both an enormous number of false positives and give entirely incorrect advice on how to fix those false positives, and for actual positives implies that removing PyQt from the system (and silencing your check's error) actually saves them from GPL incorporation in their dependencies, which it may not do at all if the dependency merely has a silent fallback to reduced functionality.
Thanks, got it now!
Nice one. 😎
 import indonesian_woman
As about another your point - that conda environment might be not enough isolated from system so the check can find system installed PyQt - that would be a no-go bug :( I'll check it.
But it applies. The parallel: the app is like platform independent driver, the enaml/qtpy/matplotlib is like Linux kernel driver wrapper, PyQt is like Linux kernel. &gt; which it may not do at all if the dependency merely has a silent fallback to reduced functionality. Yep. This is also valid. I'm not really sure that the GPL infection takes place - may be using qtpy is just fine? But I'm not sure otherwise :)
I also studied from this course. I love the way Kirill is lecturing.
[removed]
But I still expect conda environments to be isolated from the system Python... It's unexpected from me. But as I've noticed [here](https://github.com/deto/Miniconda-Install/blob/master/Linux_Install.sh#L70) additional isolation of conda environments might be needed.

r/learnpython
&gt; they may have a commercial license, which is an edge case you're completely ignoring But why not ignore it if the check is performed right in the app. Why would someoneput a check against PyQt to his app if he has a licensee for it? (after all `app.py` is a template app).
&gt; Python modules are a programming language. This is where I would like to have stopped reading. The whole article is very confusing. Please consider learning the concepts of Python first, before you try to teach them. The article is lacking basic and gives misleading and wrong information at many points. I **think** you want to explain what a module is? But you failed that completely, no mentioning of how the namespacing works, what __init__.py and __main__.py do, absolute and relative imports etc. Everyone wanting to learn about python modules is better of just reading the [modules tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html) from the Python documentation. 
Useful links: - [hypothesis.readthedocs.io](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/) (in description) - [official project website](https://hypothesis.works/) - [interactive tutorial from Pycon Asia-Pacific](https://github.com/Zac-HD/hypothesis-workshop) - [libraries.io page for Hypothesis](https://libraries.io/pypi/hypothesis) (project stats and users) I use Hypothesis all the time and am happy to answer questions, it's one of my favorite libraries :-)

I have just migrated the code over to SQLite. I now have a series of options which will return a list of any podcast episodes from within the last 24 hours, the previous 24-48 hours, or the most recent episode of every podcast in the database. Even with \~ 30 podcast subscriptions, the database is less than 2 megabytes. Due to way some podcast providers handle free subscriptions, it still takes about 2 minutes to perform the update. (The forced delaying of HTTP requests is why I want to cache the data) I can't integrate the new feature into my main codebase until I get my head around the threading / scheduling stuff that will execute the function to update the cache. But I am one step closer... Thanks to everyone who offered advice.
It looks interesting so I googled to see if there were any videos and found nothing. I noticed there aren't too many stars on Github either - a half hour demo video might go some way to getting the interest levels up. It's a better investment than docs or new features.
Thanks for sharing your code! I'm currently learning SQL and experimenting with the sqlite3 module as a start. I'm actually planning on creating something like yours. This is a great example :)
It looks nice
You aren't going to give us the syntax error?
Sure. https://github.com/deepjyoti30/ytmdl
I used itunespy and mutagen to add the metadata. Check the repo here https://github.com/deepjyoti30/ytmdl
I was thinking similar. I picked up Flask because of Sentex's youtube channel. While I'm progressing from using youtube videos as my source, they are useful. Use them to promote this framework.
It is: line 61 overlap = (norm.cdf(r1,m1,std1)-norm.cdf(lower,m1,std1))+(norm.cdf(r2,m2,std2)-norm.cdf(r1,m2,std2))+(norm.cdf(upper,m1,std1)-norm.cdf(r2,m1,std1)) ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax
I don't believe you because you've said Pgp is *useless* yet it's clearly better than nothing, even if key management is a pain in the ass. Now you're saying it's worse than other systems - which I agree with, but that doesn't make it worthless and isn't what you initially said.
Hi, this is something I'm interested in and working on. I'm not sure the term "overlapping probability" is well defined, but I believe what you are trying to get at is to quantify how much they overlap and how significant that it. You can find some discussion on this here http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aabfd2/pdf (for a version not behind a pay-wall see here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05392). We wrote this with a particular astrophysics context in mind, but the actual result is quite general. In particular, the quantity you want is Equation (11) which can be easily calculated numerically (just evaluated the pdf's over a grid and use numpy trapz). One thing that may be troubling is the requirement for a prior. However, this is required to properly evaluate the significance of an overlap. If both overlap, but the prior volume (i.e. the physically believable space they could live in) is relatively small, this isn't so significant. However, if that prior space is relatively large compared to the width of the pdfs themselves - this is highly significant. As an example, if you role a dice twice and get the same number, you would not conclude the dice is loaded. In this case the prior volume (6 different possibilities) is quite small. However, if you shuffled a deck of cards and got them all in the same order twice you would be highly surprised (they prior volume is 52 factorial here). Hence, the prior is required to put the degree of overlap into context. This is exactly the role it plays in Eq (11) of that paper. 
Hopefully this doesn't break any subreddit rules, I'm doing a short survey as part of what I hope I can turn into a broader study about the idea of "intelligible" code. I chose python mainly because it's one of the easiest language to comprehend and most programmers that I know can write python. However, I need a large sample size to start having considerable result.
Yes, why not?? Do you do inter continental tutoring??
Absolutely. Great advice. I made some for Masonite 1.5 on my YouTube channel but now that 2.0 is out I'll have to update them. 
I would feel guilty taking someones time for nothing in return. Why wouldn't you try and get a job or something to put your skills to use? You could at least make some money in return.
Interesting. I've always like laravels models much better. I do agree that its not as easy to remember field names but in that case I usually have an SQL tool open anyway. With laravel and masonite, I typically always have something like MySql workbench open anyway so it's always useful to use that to remember column names.
It's worthless because it doesn't do anything other systems can't do yet it distracts attention away from other systems, so its net benefit to the world is negative. It's _not_ better than nothing: if we didn't have it, we'd invent and use something better very quickly. But because we have it, we keep using it. There are realistic alternatives for software updates, including [The Update Framework](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf), OpenBSD's [signify](https://www.openbsd.org/papers/bsdcan-signify.html), etc. They do a better job than PGP. They're not drop-in replacements, so switching is hard. (Also, yes, TUF's web page suggests using PGP for private notification of security issues. That's a wildly different use of PGP for software updates&amp;mdash;among other things, it's encryption and not signing&amp;mdash;and the consensus of experts is that PGP is useless there _too_, it just demands different alternatives, but unlike for software updates, none of the alternatives for encrypted messaging are quite as mature as PGP.)
i was learning C, then had exams and stuff. Want to restart C ^_^
Thank you. That's a lot of things that wasn't covered by the stuff I was reading. They were too biased by Python to really give me a real *pain v pleasure* breakdown of it to really get in depth with those things like List/set/etc and generators.
Messaged you regarding python help!
Thanks for the help - will look into it!
Of course, I plan on being with Python for quite a while if not forever lol I'm going to likely get very well acquainted. I just wanted to see if anyone had those "I wish I knew this when I started" moments. 
Haha, I appreciate the concern. I am currently doing an internship, but I get bored afterward leaving the office. It would make me happy to help regardless!
Sure! I'll PM you.
I would recommend recording the session and post on youtube for others to learn from.
Good idea! Thank you
Nah
Great thanks a lot 
Thanks a lot this is really great i appreciate your help and support
YES, I'm working on an ecommerce site using python and would love to get some outside feedback. 
sounds good! PM me
Thanks in advance, why not record it and put it on youtube..
Sure! I can do that
No worries, tried to think of things that people coming from other languages often, er, 'overcook' out of habit. Python has lots of nifty economical constructions and conventions that aren't immediately obvious when people switch to it from more verbose languages. Start mucking around on little projects and post here for code review and you'll pick up more as you go, it's a very active and helpful sub :)
This is how youtube channels start
Are you just tutoring about the language or also frameworks relating to the language like Django or tensorflow. Just wondering, thanks.
Sounds good. Thank you. :) 
Try saying "please" or "I could use some help" instead.... your urgency is not of anyone's interest, especially when it comes to surveys ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
You dropped this \ *** ^^&amp;#32;To&amp;#32;prevent&amp;#32;anymore&amp;#32;lost&amp;#32;limbs&amp;#32;throughout&amp;#32;Reddit,&amp;#32;correctly&amp;#32;escape&amp;#32;the&amp;#32;arms&amp;#32;and&amp;#32;shoulders&amp;#32;by&amp;#32;typing&amp;#32;the&amp;#32;shrug&amp;#32;as&amp;#32;`¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯`&amp;#32;or&amp;#32;`¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯` [^^Click&amp;#32;here&amp;#32;to&amp;#32;see&amp;#32;why&amp;#32;this&amp;#32;is&amp;#32;necessary](https://np.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3fbrg3/is_there_a_reason_why_the_arm_is_always_missing/ctn5gbf/)
Well, depends on the framework. I know some modules very well and others somewhat well. But I wouldn't feel comfortable tutoring someone in, for example, tensorflow because I don't feel like I know it well enough 
 overlap = (norm.cdf(r1,m1,std1)-norm.cdf(lower,m1,std1))+(norm.cdf(r2,m2,std2)-norm.cdf(r1,m2,std2))+(norm.cdf(upper,m1,std1)-norm.cdf(r2,m1,std1))
Too easy. You responded super quick just now, so in case you missed it check out my edit in previous comment. The Python Cookbook is really rad for taking pythonism to the next level.
I already fixed it. And it's not neccessary. Stop lecturing me while lecturing &gt;:(
Hey, pvkooten, just a quick heads-up: **neccessary** is actually spelled **necessary**. You can remember it by **one c, two s’s**. Have a nice day! ^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
Lolllllll this is getting out of hand.
The code you linked in your post worked for me 100% unaltered in both python2 and 3. The line you quote here as being a problem doesn't appear in that code, nor does it have any obvious error all by itself. I have no idea what you are doing or what error you are really getting or why. This is your error. Take some ownership and help us help you.
Me too. I really want to learn C. 
How are you at wrapping C for Python? If any good, how would you feel about compiling a beginners tutorial (for adept Python users)?
This will raise an ImportError. You will need to `pip install indonesian_woman` first
Because it reminds you how to spell nessecary.
Ah okay just was making sure :)
0 server side templates. We rely heavily on django rest framework and django, everything is just json responses and/or async celery workers that the front end will later query. Yes it works great, separates concerns spectacularly, front ends concentrates on what they do best and we handle server scaling/caching/ scalability/ performance 
You should post videos of advanced algorithm concepts
Why? YouTube already has those, this guy enjoys personally teaching someone so why should he make advanced logarithm concepts?
You are right, sorry
you're going to have to be more specific than "this tooltip"
Can you share the challenge?
Can you share the channel?
Sure, but then again, i can pip install everything you just mentioned, i don’t need it to be available to me unless i need it. I really don’t want to put your project down, we’ve all had our babies, and our own reasons for creating said baby. Congrats on following through!
Where did I suggest this is urgent ? It's definitely not urgent.
Not full on tutor but is it possible for you to directly answer questions I might have or review small pieces of code?
Without more details, search for "tooltip" in the settings and look for somethings that looks like it could be it. (there is a search function in the settings, that is what I mean, not manually searching)
uhh me.
Thanks for testing. How does it work since "lower" and "upper" aren't defined?
I’m also mew to Python, but my experience is exclusively with Java. It’s not that different, just a lot of things have different syntax and it’s strange that you don’t declare variables. Still, I want to learn because I can’t think of anything to make with Java.
I think giving me a dedicated time to practice would be super helpful. 
Yeah man, I'd really love it if you do this. I'm working a summer job that takes up about 60-80 hours a week, so I barely find time to code anymore. I do watch a ton of YouTube before bed, so I could learn either Python or C using your tutorials before I go to bed. 
There is beer, motorcycles, women, hiking, swimming etc... when you leave the office, do one of those things. 
I'd love this but couldn't accept your work for free, i'd be happy to pay you. I'm in GMT timezone tho so that might be awkward
of course!!
I'd say neither of the 2 options is good enough. First one is too broad and some variable assignments like max_previous_amount = max(previous_amounts) are redundant. The 2nd solution is a one liner, and those quickly turn unreadable with added complexity. Your survey has no place for comments. It's only black and white. You need to have more options and allow for out of the box thinking.
This person is trying to offer his help for free. They're not looking for advice on how to spend their time.
I read through the docs and the blogs... that's basically ASP for python :D
We are duck typed. This module will swallow any object as long as they swim, look and quack like Indonesian women.
Honestly, that's something that I have yet to see that I think would be so helpful. When i started learning how to code, I would've killed for a recorded tutor session. Having someone in the video that knows very little is good so that they can ask fundamental questions.
It would seem there are two projects with a similar name, the only difference being the addition of a period. 
Similarities: 1. MVC (the controller part) 2. IoC &amp; DI 3. Scaffolding 4. Single app architecture Differences: Batteries included... pythonic thingy !
I've never used ASP but ... great if you like it! Lol
Sounds lovely. We prefer the "5 different ways to do the same thing" methodology.
Using the word "need" and "2 minutes" in the same sentence kind of implies urgency.
I do have questions without answer usually in Python
5 different ways? How so? we write our endpoints so we’re not the only ones that can consume them. Our front ends just make the call and get the data they need.
I would recommend you guys to learn [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) then. It is kind of C on steroids. It really seems amazing. When I have some spare time I will get my feet wet with it.
I'm just joking about lots of inconsistencies at my current gig. Sometimes we use DRF serializers, sometimes not. Lots of mixes like that with no clear boundary, like ORM vs. raw SQL, etc. At least 3 different implementations for monitoring task execution. Even more for handling retries. That sort of thing.
Can you teach us on how to read python documentation for libraries. I feel like everyone know how to read and use it. But for me its complicated to understand.
that's a pretty wicked github icon
Ah i see, that sucks.
Also please tell me the channel name when you do, wouldn't mind watching some python info
print("\*Will Researcher " + name + " please report to the containment chamber of SCP-173 for testing.\* You hear over the site-wide intercom.") input("Will you go? Yes or No? ") if answer == "Yes": print("You walk through the corridoors of Site-17, until reaching SCP-173.") elif answer == "No": print("An hour passes by, a scientist with an armed guard approaches -'Why did you not report to your post, Researcher " + name + "?'") On input("Will you go? Yes or No? ") nothing happens, it shows me the image above, any help is really appreciated (using python 3 in IDLE) Sorry if it seems really obvious, I'm new to python.
Looka like you have to download Chromedriver executable from here [Chromedriver Downloads](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and put it in folder in your $PATH - for example, /usr/bin
i'm a total beginner.. a bank where you need to sign in"encrypted" and can spend and import virtual money to. :) (this is my first big'ish project)
I'd love to have you on my technical video podcast!
I first read your comment the wrong way... &gt; saves them from GPL incorporation in their dependencies, which it may not do at all if the dependency merely has a silent fallback to reduced functionality. I do not get your point. If that reduced functionality of the dependency do not use PyQt then it cannot lead to the situation that our app _rely_ on PyQt (all that deps are MIT/BSD licensed but are derived works from both GPL PyQt and LGPL PySide) so out app is not a derived work from PyQt. To sum up: A is derived from B and C. D is derived from A. **BUT** D is not derived from B because A is a simple switch B vs. C.
you need to name the impu awnser. awnser = input("will you go, yes or no")
Like this: float(balance).
You never define answer, therefore...the undefined error. You need something like answer = input(...
Alt+F4. If you're not going to use the features of your IDE, don't use one.
How presumptuous of you. Also, he doesn't need to have these teaching sessions daily. Have you ever heard of volunteering? Doing things for others without any gain to yourself? 
Sure! PM me
That is really good idea! You could teach one person for hour and then make like 15min video from this lesson and post it. Everyone have different problems while learning programming, this series could be really worth to watch! 
This could be perfect for me. I started a new job and have quite a bit of experience with Python and regression frameworks. I am now working for a company that develops hw that runs c and I'd like to wrap that up for regression as well as fix stuff I find or add features.
This would be awesome. I'm trying to figure out matplotlib and pandas right now...
People are down voting but it’s a good point. This is how young engineers get burned out. 
You're missing my point. It implied that is helping me by mentioning "one c two s" but that's exactly the tough part to remember about it. It's not providing a trick to help remember it, it is just stating the facts.... "You can remember it by one c, two s’s" is silly because of that reason. I use Grammarly for finding these typos usually, but I didn't notice it this time. 
Still, the one liner is better. The mistake of "quickling turning unreadable" is not the problem of the one-liner, but of the person not turning the one-liner into more lines when it _does_ become more complex.
Very generous of you! I'm in the middle of C++ learning curve right now it is amazing but I miss the simpler days of C frankly. :)
Numbers stored in a text file dont have a type. They are simply a series of characters. When you read them in, you could try calling float(my_number) to cast them to float, or using pandas read_csv function to handle the whole thing. 
Convert the part you took from .txt file like this: `float(balance)`
Because grammarly is a pile of crap that you're also trusting with everything you send.
That didn't help at all! It blocks like 3 lines of text above? Reeeeeeeeelly annoying
I truly recommend Michael Nielsen's [free online book on deep learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com) as it really reduces the "bucketload" of stats and linear algebra into an intuitive feeling for how neural networks work and feel. You don't need to know too much about math to be able to create neural networks that work - obviously things change when you want to understand state-of-the-art research
 def iMport(): print('how much money do you want to import') amount=float(input()) with open("balance.txt", "r+")as r: balance=r.read() float(balance) newAmount=balance+amount r.write(newAmount) print('done!!') it says it must be strings not floats. what did i do wrong
i am interested
I know jack shit about coding, but have been meaning to learn Python for a couple years now. I would love a tutor to push me along!
I think that's the official name, but not what you install or import. Ever tried to import a single level of a module named x.y.z? There needs to be nastiness in the init.py file.
Not sure what the imports for QtPy are, but for Qt.Py it’s identical to PyQt/PySide, just replacing the project name with Qt. I’ve been having to build some python modules for our cluster and a bunch of them don’t import their project name, but either something different or a subset of the name. It’s a wee bit annoying. 
Your input lines need assigned to a variable. So instead of just 'input("text")' , You need 'answer = input("text")'. 
Thank you all for your wonderful messages. I unfortunately deleted this post because I received too many requests. I will try my best to help all who have already contacted me. Thank you.
You have to assign the cast of the variable to something. You just do `float(balance)` and the result gets lost. 
python isn't a great game engine if you want a graphical appealing game you shouldn't use python.
Youtube can host your videos for free. Start there please so that anyone can benefit from your work
&gt;newAmount=balance+amount You should use it in this line, when you pass the value to newAmount. Using float() doesn't alter the variable's state, it only returns it.
more garbage blog spam 
This is the answer
Hi, If "this tooltip" means Pycharm's warnings such as PEP 8 coding style violation, you can manually turn these off in File &gt; Settings &gt; Editor &gt; Inspections &gt; Python. Hope this helps! 
I've been using pygame for a long time now, and I find it perfect for all my needs, but apparently [Arcade](http://arcade.academy/) is a more up to date alternative, so I'd recommend you go with that.
Why’d you delete your post
it works half. the "newAmount" var is indeed the sum of the two floats but the write function can only write srtings to the file thanks for the help btw
Yes you must cast it to a string before you write (I’m assuming the write function only takes strings as arguments) and cast it to float when you read it in. That’s how it’s done. 
i'm a bit lost what should i do instead
Have you considered contributing to Numpy with this code?
I was receiving too many requests. I’ll help the people who have already reached out to me, but I can’t take more requests 
What gets written into the text file? Can you Give some examples of input/output? 
I believe in you, follow your dreams. ^nightmares ^are ^dreams ^too
Yeah, pretty sure they're the same. We have a series of packages called company.formats.realname/company/formats/realname/actualcode that imports as company.formats.realname. It's a hot mess.
I would avoid just using a package that provides a load of functions and just applying them to some data. Buy a book on machine learning and implement an algorithm yourself. This is what I did a few years ago and the project that I think really helped me was implementing a decision tree that predicted a feature. Try the ID3 algorithm. Don't worry about mathematical proofs just look up the method explained as an algorithm and think about how you would implement it. Find a data set with a feature that you would like to predict and split the data in half using one half for the training and remove the feature from the other half to be your testing set. Train your model on the training set then run some predictions using the testing half and see how well you did. I like decision trees because there are different methods of deciding how to order the tree. They are a nice solid introduction into a useful method.
r/learnpython
&gt; written into the text file? Can you Give some so the balance is "money". for example balance.txt contains 40 and your input is 23 the balance.txt should contain 63
&gt; The new Qt for Python project also looks promising. How so? Only advantage over PyQt at the moment is licensing (i.e. PyQt is GPL/commercial, PySide2 is LGPL/commercial). AFAIK, at the moment PyQt is still more feature-complete.
I am so much interested!!
Then I suppose it's a good thing that Python isn't an engine. 
 It is at a very basic stage right now, but I was thinking of how the convenience and conciseness of R Shiny can be brought to Python pretty easily using Dash. Combine this with the power of other Python libraries like Numpy and Pandas, and it would be like the best of both worlds, at least in my opinion. What do you all think? 
So I’m just gonna show a rough outline how I would do it: ``` amount=float(input(“How much do you want to import?: “)) #open file for reading here balance = float(file.read()) newAmount=balance + amount #whatever else needs to be done. newAmount now has a float representation of the number read in from a file and a number given as input. ``` Syntax may be wrong and sorry for formatting I am on mobile. 
Thanks.
Thank you so much.
What? Could you explain what you mean?
need help? use r/learnpython
Thanks for this! I'm about to start an open-source CRM/Management System for the insurance industry and I think I'll use this!
oh i'm sorry i will use that in the future instead.
This actually came from a [thread](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/10736) I started on Numpy about the limited options of the method. However, I don't have the knowledge to attach this to the Numpy code in a reasonable way.
Awesome! Let me know if you want a slack invite when you start so we can help on any questions and support better.
Save everyone the trouble and just use python 3.
Guys don't encourage posts like this... /r/learnpython
thanks for the cleaner code but the write function can only write srtings to the file 
Check my edit to the previous comment. 
yes your'e totally right i'm new to python and reddit and i was stupid to not read the rules
thanks!
 earlier_choice = "whatever that choice was" # some code if earlier_choice == "go left": # some code else: # other code
Obviously reading the docs and maybe some books is a good idea. One big thing to be wary of coming from C# is that you can get very loosey goosey with types in Python. This flexibility can be great and makes development quicker, but it also makes it a lot easier to write bad cod since you lose the security of static types. Good documentation can really help with this and don't ever trust someone that talks about "self documenting code" because that's a load of shit. The cleanest code will never be easier to read than a comment. Also don't fall into the of making classes for everything. Lots of classes I see people write would be better as modules. This stuff isn't really language specific just things I think you need to be more aware of when working in Python.
Why wouldn't it "work"? What would you expect it to do? Have you thought about each of those functions and looked up what they each do? `input` lets a user type something in and gives that to the script as a string. `eval` evaluates a string as if it were python. `print` prints the results of a python expression. Also, just because it *can* work doesn't mean you should do it. `eval(print())` is the epitome of insecure code.
If this data needs to be persistent (stored even when program shuts down), you could make a simple text file with key-value pairs, read / write from / to it and parse it. (there are probably libs for this though) 
Can I give you some suggestions? I like to work with data currently using python but I always want to do those things in C. Like how to load external csv file and do some data manipulations or do some simple linear regressions etc.
So sorry everyone I thought my screenshot uploaded! [this is what I was meant to include!](https://imgur.com/a/0hDguXM) Hope this makes more sense now :)

It purely depends whether you want to go "deep". If you're doing it for hobby, well, then, you might try Kaggle and walk around Python frameworks. IMHO, if you want to comprehend it on more advanced level, and, perhaps, get a job, I would say that there is no way you could make it far without fundamental knowledge.
Oh, I wouldn't have thought of it that way. I mean, the 2 minute part was used to say it's short, but I can see how attributing time could lead one to think of urgency. As far as need is concerned, I struggle to find a replacement that wouldn't seem imperative (e.g. want) or pompous (e.g. hope to find). I though of it more as the need in: "I need to find some help", deatched from the subect and pretaining yo myself, rather than an urgent and personal request, as in; "I need you to bring me that package". Alas, the subtelty of language is lost on me, I can now see how "could someone (please) help me with a single question survey ?" or some such title would have better suited the post. But reddit doesn't allow title changes, so I guess it's rather pointless to muse on that subject now. Still, it's interesting how people perceived the title, thanks for laying that out for me.
_Usually_ don't use getters and setters. They can be useful when using properties, for example if you have a bunch of booleans backed by a bitmask.
Every language has its own advantages. AFAIK Most popular data analysis libraries are not available in C. Trying to get familiar with python’s library like matplotlib, pandas, numpy, scikit will help you a lot. Go to kaggle and try the intro competition (Titanic one). There r a lot of tutorials to this competition, so you can follow one of these to gain some basic insights of data analysis &amp; these python libraries
Hi there, I know python pretty well, but no C. I’m interested in getting a handle on wrapping c as extensions in python. Would you be open to teaching me how to do that, as well ad enough C to be useful?
Thanks!
Yea but it’s different from talking with someone, which is more beneficial to my speaking imo. 
That sounds awful, who came up with that system?
Thx! Though I have already found plenty of people XD 
interested
I may not give u enough help since I have never glued them together before, but I think python libraries can help people with this easily. But I do can teach you C plus some Unix system programming stuffs like pipe. 
Python is fun. Enjoy it don't worry too much.
Only one way to learn bud.
Hey lets do it. Whenever, wherever. I could setup a shell to share on a ubuntu server so we are paired live. But however you wanna approach it works. C /system 101 is a great fit for me right now I think.
If you don't have a profile picture github generates a picture based on your username. Yours looks pretty cool: https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/16807358?s=400&amp;v=4
&gt; `eval(input())` is the epitome of insecure code. That depends. If the purpose is to make a REP(L), then arbitrary code execution is kinda the point. To secure it, you just wouldn't let malicious people use it.
&gt; I am also hoping that since it is being developed by the actual Qt team that it will be kept up even better than PyQt Maybe new management will help... maybe not. My personal hopes and dreams for pyside now span almost a decade of disappointment. Which part of PyQt do you find isn't being kept up?
Quite nice article. 
Super glad to see someone working on this, r-shiny is one of those libraries that I wish python had an equivalent. I know there was another library I stumbled across a while ago that has that aim, [spyre](github.com/adamhajari/spyre) no idea what stage of development it's at now though.
Im just using it to make a calculator 
Don't worry, my CS teacher told me, he said use variables.
screw that, instead of variables, use a whole mysql database 
I tried using pygame and it felt like expending alot of effort for nothing. Havent tred Panda3D but it looks like there is a steep learning curve. I would suggest [Godot](https://godotengine.org). Its language is similiar to python, and is under MIT licence. It should have support for python but I havent tried it so I cant say how well it works. Btw it has its subreddit too /r/godot/

Hi! Do you have resources for learning SQL? Notes, pdfs from professors, etc? I'm currently trying to learn SQL by experimenting with Python's sqlite3 module. I only learned some basic syntax from Sololearn and Datacamp and I'd like to learn more. Thanks!
Oh i didn't know that, this is really cool. Thanks for the info.
Sorry, missed your comment. I'm unaware of any other way besides paid proxies. Even then, paid proxies won't work well if they are part of a small range of subnets. It's best to have residential proxies or some sort but they can be pricey. 
Since you want to improve your English, fyi it's "stuff" not "stuffs". "Stuff" is also an uncountable plural, so it's always "this stuff" never "two stuff" or "these stuff". Hope it helps :)
Would love to learn
Undergrad in what major? 
Okay, then you simply have to uncheck the "Show parameter name hints on completion" option. You can find it in Settings &gt; Editor &gt; General &gt; Code Completion :) 
You could do both! Record your sessions and advertise it as a series.
Well that's where the *may* comes in... Stallman's own words (original was on CLISP but seems to have been archived, copy [here](https://github.com/JoshCheek/clisp/blob/master/doc/Why-CLISP-is-under-GPL) say that an app is GPL if it uses GPL'd functionality, *even if that functionality is optional*. In the case of readline, lots of apps provide tab completion via non-GPL fallbacks, but prefer to link to readline if it's available. In Stallman's take on things the fact that the link occurred on the user's machine doesn't matter because the actual work (the compiled program) is using the GPL'd functionality, which means that the source must be licensed under GPL. Which means if your user's app dependency tried this: try: from pyqt import SomeWidget except ImportError: from pyside import SomeWidget Then Riverbank *may* argue, with a substantial degree of likelihood of success (and the FSF's backing), that the dependency must be GPL, hence your user's app must be GPL. So if A is derived from (uses) B, but alternately uses C as a fallback, and B is GPL, then D is derived from B by virtue of using A even if A's use of D is never invoked at runtime. This is a somewhat untested question, though, and it's never been clearly and definitely answered for dynamic languages, where linking in the strictest sense doesn't occur, but Stallman's statement about shared libraries in that thread would seem to implicate dynamically imported modules as well, at least in spirit. None of this can be exposed by your extant test though; you're not testing it the GPL is *used* by any of the dependencies, you're just testing it it's *present* in an environment you don't control.
[Permanent](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-permanent-links-to-files/#press-y-to-permalink-to-a-file-in-a-specific-commit) GitHub links: * [JoshCheek/clisp/.../**Why-CLISP-is-under-GPL** (master → e65a18f)](https://github.com/JoshCheek/clisp/blob/e65a18f16de2b35791216f93bdf3c4c2376e426d/doc/Why-CLISP-is-under-GPL) ---- 
There are statistical quantities similar to the overlap. Including the [KS Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test). That, like overlap is in [0,1]. An alternative I like because it has physical meaning is the area distance. That is the area between the two CDF curves. This is nice because it has units of the actual statistics and can handle both continuous and discrete random variables. Plus, it reduces to just the absolute difference between two numbers (if you model a single number as a delta function).
After a quick scan of your code: At the end you say it's closing in 15 seconds, but pass 5 to the sleep function. A LOT of global variables. The flow is clearer if you pass everything (most) through function arguments / return values, eventually use a class for it. When you get LabelSize and InputSize form user, if it's correct you convert it to string to display even though it's string already, and if not, you assign a float to it. It's better to keep the same type you need (you need a float or a string - decide). Use string formatting instead of concatenation. It's faster, more readable and if you use format method or F string you don't have to worry about what type it is. Name of the file indicates it's version 3, while comment says it's v4. You open the same file twice - once you get headers, the second time you process data. Why not merge it into one. 
Additionally, it's generally a good idea to add a [main guard](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html) around code that you'll be executing directly, so that if someone wants to load up your code from another Python script, you won't be prompting the user.
If it's common, how is it a misspelling? These comments are parsed by humans, not an interpreter. Could a mod shoot this bot please? 
Yeah. Move all the code that's outside of any function into a new function (for example named main) and call it from within main guard. It'll allow user that wants to call your code to decide if he wants to execute it or not. 
THANK YOU, you beautiful human being!!
By the way. I fixed conda environment isolation - fixed shortcutter app. Now it doesn't see neither system python modules nor modules installed with `pip install --user`. So the demand to uninstall only about the particular conda env. ``` Try setting 'PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1' env var before activating conda env or uninstall '{}' module from conda env to use the app." ``` 
Dude thank you! I appreciate that a lot. I never had any real training so this is hodgepodge of Google and Stack Overflow. I'll go over this again with your tips, thank you!
Haha it's such a simple idea and I would have never thought of it, thank you!
Truth be told this will be used by army dudes to convert Excel files as a Py2exe file. So would that even need to be considered or is this one of those good in practice things I should be doing more?
This is very nice.
Yea, but you'll find that it is easier to get fundamental knowledge after having had a bit of applied experience.

You're on the right track. If they let you know that they would likely accept a pull request, the next steps will be cloning their github, finding the percentile method in the numpy code, making the appropriate changes to it, adding tests, testing everyhing, and submitting a pull request. Then, you'll respond to the code review, and finally push your change. After that, congrats, you're a contributor! If they don't want to include this in numpy yet, it's still nice that you wrote it. You can also consider publishing it to pypi if people express interest in using it.
Possibly not the best example, but check my [init_ui](https://gitlab.com/open-pipeline/prman_pydenoise/blob/master/main.py) for a quick demo.
Yes, but that's a lot of resources to consume in the case of your number being divisible by the first item in the first group. And if your number is divisible only by the last prime in the last group, you'll have wasted a lot of time testing values in later groups that are multiples of values in earlier ones.
&gt; Then Riverbank may argue, with a substantial degree of likelihood of success (and the FSF's backing), that the dependency must be GPL, hence your user's app must be GPL. That's the funniest point ever! PyQt is not GPL actually but a GPL + Riverbank exception. That exception allows licensing derived works (from PyQt) to be licensed MIT or BSD. So by this exception the dependensies are leagally MIT and BSD. And the app imports from them. So it technically derives from MIT/BSD software. But if I neither do not such a dirty hack check nor fine tune every dep separately they would actually import from PyQt and use it. So this whole situation bugs me a lot. Is the app GPL infected **with** my check? Is it GPL infected **without** my check?
Hmm, i think I started to get what you mean, so if 3 is in a group and 9 is in another and 27 is in another it will do two extra operations when it only needs to divide by 3. This is what you mean, right? Interesting!
Also you can have getters and setters via @property, and @attrib.setter, which will execute a function each time you call for the value, or set the value. Makes it appear as though you are directly dealing with values.
Our program manager to brand our code that our customers didn't read even though they had the source. Better still was the fact our IDE can't trace the imports. You also have to make a special hook for pyinstaller.
What I've been trying to say is that your check can't really determine (or elucidate) whether or not the GPL has been involved, unless and until you can also determine *how* it become involved (ie by a completely isolated environment, which would really require a hacked interpreter executable). The Riverbank exception mainly relates to distribution; if you (or your dependency) *use* but do not *distribute* PyQt -- i.e. the end user must download and install PyQt on their own -- then your code isn't "infected" with the GPL ... but since your check is really only determining if PyQt is present, and not *how* it came to be present, it's at best an indication that the GPL *may* be implicated, which is why I object to advising the user to uninstall.
Im interested in Webscraping. Can you help please!!
From my point of view, if the solution can be completely described in a sentence, the function should also be a one liner (using auxillary functions such as `mean` where needed).
If you've gotten to a truly isolated environment (ie manipulating PYTHONPATH doesn't change import sourcing, and neither does the presence of a file or python package in the cwd), then I'm less worried about the check providing false positives.
PythonTutor.com now has a mode where people can ask for help and get connected with someone else. Could be fun to spend some time on there helping people. 
Automate the Boring Stuff with Python https://automatetheboringstuff.com I liked this book very much. If i got stuck at a point , i always found someone offering a lucid explanation on YouTube. Also, dataquest.io offers first 10 or so lessons for free. It worked for me.
I totally agree with you about the assumption that the that dep should've been GPL. In this case using GPL dep would clearly lead to the GPL infecting. But we have Riverbank exception - see my previous comment. &gt; you're not testing if the GPL is used by any of the dependencies, you're just testing it it's present in an environment you don't control Strong point. They would actually try to import from PyQt. So the app would _use_ dep that imports from PyQt (though never successfuly - I guarantee that). That dep is MIT/BSD but it's still not clear enough for me that it's safe. Will the problem be solved if I use auto-patched deps modules with `import dummy`/`import from dummy`? Will it be solved if I use special dummy PyQt package (with a special version and with a check for this special version in the app) that is nothing but a import error raiser? It may lead to trademark/copyright issues though... 
From iomg or img?
Yes. Ultimately for trial division all you really need to check is whether or not your number is divisible by any of the primes less than or equal to your number's square root.
Varaiable name should be: PYTHONPATH. No spaces as it is.
Try adding quotation marks around the path name. It is assuming that the file name is only as far as the first bit of whitespace after 'Coding'.

Are you still looking.
&gt; i.e. the end user must download and install PyQt on their own -- then your code isn't "infected" with the GPL ... That's not an obvious claim for me. I haven't seen something about this in that exception. And that mentioned conditions do not make sense. Are you sure about that? I remember that exception allowing licensing derived works under some other licenses other that GPL (no proprietary among them for sure). As I see the situation no matter if the user installed PyQt himself or it was bundled with the app - in both cases if the app was derived from PyQt it should be GPL+exc.
No. Thanks for taking the time to go through this. But the project has been postponed for further trials and tests.
Good bot
I’m about to quit my job to go to start a cyber security boot camp. I did python on codecademy. I need to learn python 3 though. And I’m watching a computer science class online. I have no one around me to talk about it with. I’m currently a truck driver. 
1. For every change makes most sense. Make sure you "communicate" what people can expect when they upgrade. 2. Look at "semver".
What the hell... I've always know hackernoon to be near 100% garbage, but apparently a front for SPAM as well... This is a facade for more 'gainfromhere' spam and should be avoided.
Honestly I don't think you can solve the issue via any simple runtime import check (or trying to bash it with a superseding module) ... the runtime environment simply isn't up to you. Nor should it be. To really determine if your end user is involving PyQt's excepted GPL in their own code you'd need to determine if their code imports it (OR if any of their dependencies import it) AND if they're distributing PyQt with their code. The first two could be determined by a regex search of all their source code, but the last is only hinted at by the success of an import of PyQt; I'm pretty sure a reliable determination would require at least superuser permissions, if not outright psychic ability. It might be slightly easier to do the above for GPL code without Riverbank's somewhat nutty exception, but even there you're getting into areas not readily or reliably open to automation.
I haven't actually tested PYTHONPATH though. I doubt that conda even checks it. But I'll take a look. Thanks! CWD is fine - it's rather rare and easily to fix by the user case. Here is the [GPL exception](https://github.com/cms-externals/pyqt/blob/master/GPL_EXCEPTION.TXT). And there is nothing about distribution.

Hey that actually worked... Didn't realize it'd be something that simple. Thanks!
It's mainly what you should do from the beginning next time. You cast LabelSize to float and add it to string - it's not defined. You should rather do: `if LabelSize.isalphanumeric: LabelSize = float(LabelSize)` but then you need to convert it to string for printing (or better use mentioned string formatting methods) Do you need it to be a string or float? 
More low rent SPAM
What about using live streaming to teach multiple people? 
Now I see the second your point: The app should not download PyQt as it's also some kind of usage. Makes sense. That's pretty hard to fix without patching the deps themselves. The simplest solution I see is to maintain a separate conda repo with patched enaml, qtpy, pyqtgraph, matplotlib that neither import from PyQt nor depend on it (so having them as deps won't lead to automatic install of PyQt). That packages have special versions with `ps` postfix. And the app makes `ps` postfix check. But that seems too complex for a simple task of using PySide with all that modules that are actually meant to be used with PySide. That's a leagally OK task after all. Why so many problems with that :(
It's been a while since I've read the exception (and that was PyQt4), but the gist of the first clause was that you could use any of the specified, GPL-incompatible FOSS licenses provided that your code (or its binary distribution) *imports* PyQt... if you distribute PyQt, then you're not covered by the exception. That was clarified in [this thread](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/pipermail/pyqt/2016-September/038129.html) some time ago; as long as the software didn't itself bundle the GPL version of PyQt it could remain MIT.
Would be helpful to understand the down-votes? In my view this is relevant, of interest (as shown from previous posts), and contains useful information.
Conda is just the package manager, as I understand it it doesn't patch the Python interpreter itself to change that behavior.

Now there's a $10 idea.
See my other comment re: the exception; it specifies *import* only, and riverbank's comments elsewhere (and the rest of the GPL) implicate distribution. Also not sure if that version applies to PyQt5, which IIRC is GPL 3, not 2.
Ultimately because Riverbank wants to make money, and Nokia dropped the ball. Often.
Yep, distribution is also a problem. Is yaml with the list of deps that always end up installing PyQt really a problem? We are deleting PyQt after all and making sure that it's not importable! I can't belive it :(

I do a release about once a year, so for me about once a year. Semver or semantic versioning is in theory about which numbers you change. Major changes get a big number bump. New features would go in the minor group and the 3rd number for bug fixes. It's hardly exact though, so do the best you can.
To sum up: - the people for whom it's important may be paranoid about not entering "gray area", - so there should be no doubts, - make sure deps modules do not try to import from PyQt, - make sure deps modules do not auto-download PyQt. to make it convenient this should be done via patching/fixing package manager packages themselves: so the end user would be able to simply install the app as a module - put that special no-pyqt deps into the app module itself (special versions with postfixes presumably).
Unpopular opinion I agree w/ it
I would second the suggestion for Godot. It's a pretty good FOSS engine with tons of features and GDscript is similar to python. 
Those aren't widget classes. For widgets you'll be wanting to use https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/forms/widgets/#built-in-widgets.
But that's such a pain in the ass. For now I'll add a superceding pyqt module (that' s a dummy and simply raise import error) in the special conda channel. With that if specifying special versions when creating conda env we guarantee that PyQt would not be installed. We install dummy PyQt instead. If the app performs checks for these specialy marked version of PyQt we also guarantee that when deps try to import from PyQt they actually import from dummy PyQt. So we guarantee no import and no download of PyQt. The trademark issue still there though. Thank you very much for interesting conversation! It made me unhappy in the end but that was inevitable I guess :)

I'm not a professional developer (yet) and I write many scripts that have one specific purpose, but I always consider that if I had this problem someone else might have a similar one and might find my code one day. I'm trying to make it easy to use, but rarely spend significant extra time to refractor it just for this purpose. 
Don't worry, plenty of people on YouTube will correct your English, whether you want them to or not.
I think the second one is easier to read. But I think a comment stating what the validation criteria actually is should be included since it's not immediately apparent when comparing the 2 algorithms.
Is not that sive method ? I guess ! I will work on doing so , but to keep track of all those prime numbers u need lots of memory that is interesting

Working on a small utility that renames the contents of a folder based on a csv in that folder. Nothing too fancy.
Semver is pretty exact: the first number is for when someone using your software can't use the new release without changing their code, the second number is for when they can't change their mind and go back to older releases without changing their code, and the last is when they can do both but you still need a new release. So, if version 1.0.0 of my software is out, and I rename or remove a function (even the tiniest of functions), I have to release 2.0.0. If I add new functions (even thousands of new functions), I have to release 1.1.0, not 2.0.0. If I change something in an entirely backwards-compatible way, where the release is just like 1.0.0 but better, I have to release 1.0.1. Yes, this generally means you should avoid making tiny changes that require a major version bump, and instead try to provide some backwards-compatibility logic if you can. Defer your generic cleanups for when people are going to have to change their code anyway.
For every change you want people to use and think is ready to be used. I don't make releases of software when I simply update docs (especially if the docs are automatically rendered from `master`) or add better tests or refactor code, but I do make releases even for fixing a single bug when I know someone cares about getting the fix (e.g., someone other than me reported the bug) and I have nothing else to include in the release. I think it is courteous to always make a release shortly after merging a PR from someone else that contains a functional change (either a new feature or a bugfix). How long is "shortly" depends on the project: if you have a regular release cycle, that's fine. If you are expecting other changes to land soon too, it's fine to wait on them. If you don't have anything else, better to release tonight than in a year.
There are safer ways to make a calculator. A calculator doesn't need to be able to run code.
This was posted 5 minutes ago and has already amassed ~25 votes from a source known for its subpar content. That seems a bit off to me.
I do not fallow could you help me find more ways because I am still new.
But did you know that the 5-number summary can be computed for any distribution? Wow! 
Can you add output for the examples in the README? Will make it a little clearer what it does.
You can use regexes, the https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html operator library to handle standard operators without a bunch of if/else clauses. If you feel you must evaluate explicit user input (without later needing to know the type) check out ast.literal_eval https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html. Just a few thoughts off the top of my head, hope they help.
It really depends on what you want your calculator to do. It's simple if you just need something that can do one operation at a time. But handling expressions like (3+1)*5^6 can get a bit tricky.
&gt; So, if version 1.0.0 of my software is out, and I rename or remove a function (even the tiniest of functions), I have to release 2.0.0 Yes, that is the intention, but almost nobody follows it that strictly, so it loses meaning. Python, numpy, scipy, pandas, etc. do not follow it and they're very core tools. We got a whole bunch of new features in Python 2.7.7 because the core devs decided to not release a Python 2.8, despite adding the capability of struct to support unicode strings, which was a huge help to writing Python 2/3 compatible code. Python 2.6 has no problems with `float(2.80D+4)`, but Python 2.7 and 3.x do.
try w3schools.com
this shit is too funny
Currently someone could type into your calculator `import subprocess; subprocess.call(["rm", "-rf", "/"])` and you'd not doing a thing to stop them. The very simplest thing you can do if you still want to use python's maths stuff instead of interpreting the user's input yourself, is to make sure the user is only inputting characters which are either numbers or mathematical operators. Specifically, you want to *assert* that the *set* of characters they enter *is a subset* of all digits and operators. So legal_chars = set("0123456789-+*/()") user_str = input("Input maths here:\n\t") assert set(user_str).issubset(legal_chars), "Only maths will be accepted in user input"

"Every change" only if you practice a zero defect mindset and use good regression discipline.
Thank you so much! I did not know about Georeferencing, I'll definetely try it out.
&gt;&gt; So, if version 1.0.0 of my software is out, and I rename or remove a function (even the tiniest of functions), I have to release 2.0.0 &gt; &gt;Yes, that is the intention, This is also why people rank changes for priority, withhold such changes until more important things need release, or just give up and leave cosmetic annoyances in because too much code depends on it.
No offense, but as an undergrad you might not be able to offer much real world experience to your teachings. It’s awesome that you’re trying to do this but honestly who would you be teaching, the ultimate beginners?
[This](https://github.com/zyocum/map-marker) was my little Sunday evening project. I had played with [Folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium) a while back and recently started looking at [OpenCage](https://geocoder.opencagedata.com), so I though it would be great to use the two together to put markers on a global map based on natural language queries. It really wasn’t too difficult at all and I ended up with a neat little tool. You can see an iPython notebook preview [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/zyocum/map-marker/blob/master/map_marker.ipynb?flush_cache=true).
It's still trial division, it's just an optimized version of it. But yes, you need to know the relevant primes to divide from, and a Sieve of Eratosthenes is a good way to generate those, though there's something to be said for just having a single lookup table for the first few thousand or so primes as well. And for the Sieve there's a trick to managing memory; use a *bit array* and *bit manipulation* to simply store a single bit yes or no for every number, indicating if the number at that position is prime or not. From that relatively small mask (about 125Kb per 1,000,000 digits) you can generate the actual prime values as ints as needed.
Or just not follow semver. Not many projects do. Your project gets to define how you want to define what a major and minor release is and what's allowed to change. Personally, I care more about stability in time than stability in number. How often do I really need to update my code? If that breaking change never affects me, it doesn't matter. Setuptools is on July 20, 2016 released 24.1.0. 6 minor/bug releases were done by the time 25.0 was released on July 23, 2016. There on version 39.2 now. That's slightly excessive. I still use setuptools and while I'm sure there have been changes, it's hard to even tell. I'd personally rather just do a major bump once a year. At that point, you're not using the 2nd digit, so might as well just move where the digit is.
Um. Yes? The Python folk do accept pull requests, and there's the PEP system for enhancements and new features.

Do your own homework. If you'd like constructive help on the issue you are facing in your own attempts, head over the /r/learnpython.
I'd recommend refactoring your module to make it easily pypi-installable and more pythonic in the way you import it.
Sorry if this is confusing. I meant to say “What features will help improve the logging module?”

Haha. Sorry. I was just looking for ideas and suggestions that other people had :)

Read the sidebar for information on how to properly format your code so that it renders correctly.
Why do you want to lose money to have someone else do your homework, where you can get free tutoring in /r/learnpython. The point of school assignments isn't to just have them done, it's to strengthen your understanding of the subject... Which is why you're going to the class in the first place. 
A few suggestions on the side project: I would migrate the storage backend to SQLAlchemy and separate the models from the DAO. `Database.py` is... kinda scary. The beauty of SQLAlchemy is you don't have to worry about creating the schema manually. You actually don't have to write queries manually at all (and shouldn't). On the subject of models, there aren't really any models. There are lots of functions with really large inputs and returns where OO might make things a bit cleaner. Overall it's decently readable.
&gt; or whatever the cool kids use now Generally nginx. For python apps, you use something called uWSGI which serves traffic over a unix socket, and nginx serves *that* to end users. These days you don't even have to know how it works unless you're a devops engineer. Just run [this docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx/): docker run -v $(pwd)/app:/app -p 80:8080 -it tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx:python3.6 Zero to serving traffic in ten seconds.
Rather than adding them after creating them... create them in a loop or comprehension. For instance... `my_instances = [MyClass(x) for x in range(5)]`
I'm learning django, so I decided to give this a try. I agree with you on Django's auth system. I tried to follow the tutorial for a blog and ran into 500 server errors on registering. Login doesn't work, but registering the same name gives additional errors. I'm using postgresql, so I may have set something wrong in the .env file. Being a new framework, though, this means no one has had this error enough for google to find it on stackoverflow. :'( Your docs are decent, but django's are definitely better. Also, I don't like your organization of folders. Maybe it makes more sense if I get further. However, as a newbie, the deep nesting of very common files doesn't seem to make sense, compared to other files that reside on the surface. For example the model files are directly 'app' but the controller files are two folders deeper in the same 'app' folder. Moving the model into a 'model' folder and moving the controllers up out of the 'http' folder would make it more comprehensible for new people. However, I realize there's probably a reason for your madness. However, Django largely makes is really easy to see where your stuff and how it's connected. Also there are things like django-baker (no longer actively developed as far as I can tell) that stub out files. I like that the stubbing is inherent to your design.
My brain just went into flames trying to read this 
Speaking from my own experience, configuring JSON formatted log messages and using zulu formatted ISO timestamps in UTC should be much easier out of the box.
Yeah it's completely preference on the file structure. Some people say that love it and it makes sense and other people say they dont get it. I'll try stepping through that tutorial again and see if I hit any issues. If you have any time can you open an issue about that? You can really put your controllers and models wherever you like them to be although and whatever makes sense for your application. the string controllers in the routes point the the default folder location nested inside the app directory but you can import the controller into the route file directly and use it that way. Masonite doesn't really have a "you must do it this way" but instead of about 3 different ways to do something and you can pick the best one that fits your project.

look at he documentation for the ‘crimson.color(...)’ method. it might take the color in a different format (RGB perhaps or a hex string). Hard to tell without looking at the docs.

Oh thank you very much for reviewing my codes. I will take your advice!
Yea there are plenty of people who r ultimate beginner here. I’m sure I’m capable of teaching stuff like binary trees
Unfortunately they are mostly from different backgrounds. I will try live stream if it’s doable :)
Cs for sure
Thank you!
I do! Try Stanford’s online database course?
Yes, a lot of people don't follow semver. But semver has a defined meaning. (As far as I know, none of those four projects follow semver; [NumPy has an open issue requesting it](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/10156), for instance.) Another entirely valid way to release projects is that all increments of all positions indicate added features, and the software commits to never breaking backwards compatibility.
You're posting in the wrong sub You've been posting the same request for help for a few days You've been offered assistance with the project in /r/learnpython if you share what you've got You're posting with the same handle that you're using to sell drugs 
By the way. The latest conda versions work only with Python interpreter shipped with Anaconda/Miniconda. And I think they actually use patched interpreter. For example now they use patched pip even.
Thank you
Pm me
 Cool
What?
Thanks! I actually didn't realize that subreddit existed, i'll hop on over there.
I really think too slowly. After all the discussion the best way would be to solve the problem is to do that upstream: make sure that there is a reliable switch in that MIT/BSD deps modules that effectively turns the whole app to something like: ```py if False: import PyQt ``` (maybe it's already there) And also remove PyQt from their dependencies so that they do not auto-download PyQt (I guess most of them already behave this way).
Trying to grok asyncio. I've got a bunch of experience with JavaScript's event loop and async/await. I've used gevent before. asyncio's API is all over the place by comparison. One example: \`asyncio.wait(coros)\` will not cancel \`coros\` if the \`wait\` coroutine is cancelled, but \`asyncio.gather(\*coros)\` will. I've read all the history of generators, \`.send\` and \`.throw\`, \`yield from\`, and now async/await, but we're supposed to ditch all that and use futures / tasks? There's threads on this subreddit asking "should I stick with asyncio?" There's countless blogs and comments complaining about it. Is there any light at the end of the tunnel?
Ahhh this is it. Thank you. But damn this means I can't do this for my project.. As a follow up question, can you suggest an idea for a project for a class? I feel like whatever I think of, it's already been done before. I honestly don't know what has not been done before and the difficulty level is suitable for beginners.
I have a tkinter gui that i want coded for $, its relatively easy and should take 30 minutes. Message me and ill send you the task and you name your price.

^ ignore this, OP :p
You don't learn by having somebody else do it...
Describe the details of your project
You probably won't like the price from those who actually did their homework in college. Plus, this is quite basic. You need to know what this problem will teach you.
Good point, im just really short on time.
Pm me
Not really. My teacher cant teach python at all he needs help to write his own code so this is the only thing i can do for grades. Not that its any of your business.
Well then the F you get on this should teach you to manage your time better
If you are about to ask a question, please consider r/learnpython
Great point! I'll jump right on that. Good to hear it's handy :) 
That's a shame. But Python has absurdly good and free resources online to help anyone of any skill level learn it, so you don't really need a good teacher to learn it. You could probably even learn it faster than your curriculum is teaching it, so you could be way ahead. That is, if you're actually wanting to learn programming and not just going through this class because you have to. If you'd like, you can PM me your problem and I'll try and help you understand it. I won't do it for you. I also won't charge you. So PM me if you want to actually learn more. If not, well, programming isn't for everyone, and I won't hold it against you if you don't want my help. 
In general, try to make as few releases as possible, and try to update the less significant digit of version rather than the more significant, when possible. This is so because if anyone else is using your library, they will come to depend on it. Updating dependencies is a work that distracts you from working on your own project. In general, I believe, that people come to expect from a version to say what major, minor and patch iterations of the program you are working with, with the meaning of: 1. "patch" is something that doesn't break anything in API compared to any other previous or future patches of the given minor version. In Python it is common to number patches and some packages iterate patches into two-digit numbers, but in other environments, patch is typically reserved for information like "is this program a pre-release version?", "was this an internal release for tersters?", "was this released to customer?", "was this a security patch after program was released to customer?" etc. Python semver also supports this (eg you can sometimes see packages called like `foo-1.1.rc1` or `bar-1.1.alpha2`, but this is rare. 2. "minor" version is for changes which are backwards-compatible, but not forward-compatible. In other words, you can only add new features if you updated minor version. All old functionality should be still present (but it could be deprecated, perhaps even disabled). Though, in practice, package maintainers rarely follow this rule... which is often a source of bitter disappointment and resentment between the said maintainers and the package users. 3. "major" is when the package is, basically, an entirely new program: it needs not be backwards-compatible or forwards-compatible.
I think that it is OK. For many other things that are kind of broken in Python, `logging` is very palatable and so far, I didn't have a reason to complain. Funny enough, it violates Python's own naming convention... but I don't care much about it, as long as it works.

You make a good argument, i never thought about it like that.
I don't know why you got downvoted. I guess w3schools is not recommended? I'll do some searching and will be looking at their website later. Thanks!
Cool! Can you please share them? lol I searched for the course and it comes with a hefty pricetag (I may have looked at the wrong website, though). I can only afford self-learning at the moment :)
Good stuff! I had looked at it fr my own project some time back and thought it was good. But I'm relying on so many Flask extensions that I wasn't too sure would react well to be living in an async context, that I backed away. Nothing against Qwart per-se, I think it's a mistake from the Python interface that forces you to make a choice from the get go when it comes to async or not async.
Honestly I think it's pretty solid, but the documentation could use cleaning up... you've pretty much got to go through multiple pages and the Advanced Examples and the Logging Cookbook to begin to really understand it, but they're not exactly linked together in a logical progression and you end up bouncing all over the place.
Going to sound ridiculous probably to some, but would be nice to be able to do something like “logging.debug(“foo”)” right out of the box instead of importing and then configuring a logger and all that... I come from the web dev world and am spoiled by “console.log” for quick checks of things.
nice read; thank you for the share. I honestly did not know (8) \_\_reduce\_\_
Well they'd pretty much have to patch pip to get it to work in CA's ecosystem, but I'd want to know exactly what patches were made to the interpreter itself. If they've removed or heavily modified basic import search, I'd be both surprised and a little horrified. At the end of the day I've only rarely found any use for conda, and recommend it about as rarely. But then I haven't been on Windows in years.

About the asserts in unittests, im pretty sure the asserts from the unittest framework are better for testing.
It's not just you, but python has [string interpolation.](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/string-interpolation) the latest (since Python 3.6) being [f-strings](https://cito.github.io/blog/f-strings/) 
looks like 8 common security gotchas but I'll add two anyway to make it 10 &gt; 9. Using the system Python runtime and not patching it &gt; 10. Not patching your dependencies 
An upstream solution would generally make more sense than the various hacks, and a concerted effort on making a uniform interface would be great, though I suspect you'd be chasing that for years. But then I also still think trying to protect your users from GPL isn't a task you should be undertaking. Though I'll admit a lot of people get confused on this point, GPL licensing is generally a good thing, and as I've always read Riverbank's intent they're trying to encourage *either* FOSS usage of their code with pushback of improvements, *or* commercial licensing with a sensible pushback of profits to the people who did the heavy lifting. The use of miniconda as a distribution mechanism *may* create some additional cases in which you're effectively distributing PyQt source even when PyQt isn't used, but that seems to be more of an argument for blacklisting miniconda than PyQt.
To expand slightly, asserts (in actual code) are for early detection of your program being in an invalid state - it would likely crash later on (perhaps with a more obscure error message) if the assert is not there. *Never* use them for any sort of control flow or something the user should ever see.
Starting to develop a farming simulation game for my masters' thesis project.This is my first time coding in Python( I am a cog sc major). could use some help :)
Curious about the Pythonic in the way you import it. How would that look like?
It's a Python thing; the language is strongly typed and has no type-coercion defined for the operator "+" between strings and other types, so the str() is indeed necessary for it to treat everything like an actual string, but you shouldn't be concatenating things using + in the first place. Google str.format() or f-strings as the other commenter mentioned
This has nothing to do with the **print** function, it's the concatenation that's causing you problems. When using the + operator you're *usually* invoking the __add__ method of whatever's on the left of the operator with whatever's on the right as the argument... now how should a string know how to add an integer to itself? You might think convert it to a string and concatenate, but that's a bit odd, especially when the same integer used with the multiply operator would behave differently. And how should a string divide? To avoid ambiguity and guessing, Python expects you to always pass a string as the argument to **str.__add__**. Simple. But then you could recognize that **print** will do some magic for you anyway: print("Foo:", len(bar)) Because **print** is the one case where Python can reasonably guess that anything you pass as *args to it you want to convert to a string and concatenate with some -- usually the default -- separator. **caveat**: I say *usually* in the bit about invoking the + operator with a reservation; Python will actually try the __radd__ method on whatever's on the right with the left item as the argument as a fallback if the normal way around isn't supported for both types... that's normally much more important for custom classes than built ins though, but an implementation detail that can bite you some times.
Ah very cool. Thanks for taking the time to write that up. I guess I need to start developing the .format habit now!
Never breaking backwards compatibility is a terrible idea. The unofficial motto of my project is get it right in a sane way and if that requires breaking backwards compatibiluty, so be it. That's a reaction to the nonsense done in the code I'm interfacing with that has 40 years of backwards compatibility and 40 years of let me just add this feature quickly. There are multiple punch card relics still there and that's a level beyond Fortran relics.
Thank you!
I'm still learning python, made some cool stuff as an Ad website scrapper that send me an SMS when the price of interresting items get below a fixed price (built with Flask,html5,bootstrap,Beautifulsoup, sqlite3 and twilio). Now I'm trying to build a private streaming website to download torrents in sequential mode and playing them within a web interface (For educational purpose). Managed to scrap the web to get the desired magnet link, open it with peerflix and vlc, now trying to embed it all in flask and a web player... 
Is #1 really common in Python?
I don't see why a traceback from an assert is any worse than from a value error.
the problem is always "follow a tutorial and not understand the details" or "you need to build this API by tomorrow I wrote an API that uses that exact code (its behind a firewall and only internal to the company, but still makes me uncomfortable)
thanks, there's good stuff there.
But how? All the Python libraries that implement dbapi have paremeterized cursors, no?
I really like your project, would you mind sharing the sources if you manage to succed with your project ? :)
re-read it. that's a shell command, not a database command. it's running a command line program.
I've tested how the MIT/BSD dual backend modules switches work - and importing PySide or/and setting os env var reliably prevent from even trying to import from PyQt. So that point may be closed for now. Now about the fact that both pip and conda install pyqt when you install for example enaml and pyside2 and set up your app the way it's as a whole cannot import from PyQt (see above). So the app depent on BSD enaml that when installed also installes pyqt. If we take the app as a whole it never attemps to link to pyqt (import from it), moreover it cannot do so because of it's configuration. Is it that bad really that auto-install of pyqt happen?
Yup. Using **str.format** looks a lot more verbose than concatenation, but it's way more powerful.
interesting. I'll try to find the time to check it out
A runtime flag can strip out all the assert statements. Don't use them for logic.
Think you meant to write "Pure" not "Purge".
For #1, just don't pass `shell=True`. 
So don't use the flag? Why would you disable error checking? No you have to do error checking this way. Either you're disabling error checking or not.
Can someone explain me this step ? \&gt; Check the independence between the independent variables You have to check your assumption? isn't there a way to determine if they're independant? 
Hey, LadyDanaee, just a quick heads-up: **independant** is actually spelled **independent**. You can remember it by **ends with -ent**. Have a nice day! ^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
The end point of my investigation is to check if distributing propriate python apps with a nice Qt GUI can be done via small packages - without providing the interpreter with all modules. So that the end-user uses python package manager (pip or conda) and the app is only the module itself + dependencies. Everything seems to be fine with that except your concerns about pyqt being installed py the package manager as a dep.
Fair enough, I got stuck on the SQL injection part.
in SQL injection, it happens when people do string concatenation anyway, instead of using params. anyone can fuck up given a bad enough doc/guide :-)
How does this circumvent it?
r/learnpython and read the sidebar. 
It's disabling "debug" mode, not disabling error checking. When users receive your code, they are unlikely to expect a logical difference between asserts on and off. The language is designed to use asserts for testing and debugging, not for program logic. 
I doubt that it really matters. Judges are much more concerned with the spirit of the law than the letter, if it's not being used by any of the code and what is effectively a bug in the package manager is resulting in incidental install, only the worst form of human would insist on any resolution other than an upstream fix of that bug.
If it's not actually being used, but merely being installed by the package manager incidentally on the user's machine, but not being bundled with it (say into a frozen exe via PyInstaller et al) in a distinct distribution. then it should be fine.
You can pass arguments as strings directly to the target program, your shell ( that can potentially execute arbitrary code) is never involved. It's slightly faster as well.
But that's not a bug. That's an intended behaviour. The developers added PyQt dep so that the end user may simply type ``` pip install pyqtgraph ``` And everything works out of the box. That's convenient for FOSS modules as PyQt always was more stable than PySide that had many bugs. But if we want to leverage pip/conda for distributing propriate Qt apps and dont's wanna buy PyQt license that may be the issue. Does the fact that's not a bug changes things?
Here it is it was an interesting idea so i thought to implement it too.[comic downloader](https://github.com/avinash-tiwari/Some-Cool-Python-Scripts/blob/master/comic_downloader.py)
You don't run arbitrary code; ffmpeg will just be passed the full shell string (and try and open() it and fail because it's not a real file).

I have encountered cases where I was unable to get the thing to run without it though. It had no sensible reason not to do what it was supposed to, but it just did not work. I think it was a pandoc call that had a filepath as an argument (template dir if I remember correctly), and it just outright ignored any path I gave it if I didn't set shell=True.
Taking a picture, upload it, creating this thread and commenting, probably took half the time needed for this assignment isn't it? 
I agree, configuration and instantiation of the logger could be made simpler.
The code is available here: https://codepad.remoteinterview.io/KITCJRGMFF The error occurs: File "/temp/file.py", line 54 print norm.cdf(r1,m1,std1), "-", norm.cdf(lower,m1,std1), "+", norm.cdf(r2,m 2,std2), "-", norm.cdf(r1,m2,std2), "+", norm.cdf(upper,m1,std1), "-", norm.cdf( r2,m1,std1) SyntaxError: invalid syntax
PyTest is really best used for unit tests. What kind of integration testing are you looking to do?
Glad we cleared that up :)
Ok nice! Well good luck. 
Sadly DocRaptor is just an external service and not a library which makes PDFs by itself
And... in GitHub it is extremely easy to add one. Why not? There is little if any downside.
Thanks! Best of luck to you too! 
Maybe you are right. But yes ... I just followed GitHub's lead. Why not?
[http://www.multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/](http://www.multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/) This is a great start. I took a crack at it in python, if you care to look. [https://dicksvps.site/chip8.py.txt](https://dicksvps.site/chip8.py.txt)
Thanks. The code does have a few complicated components (mainly in the configuration module). But, that is entirely to enable flexibility for the end user/developer. Being built on top of a very UN-opinionated framework, the goal was to enable the developer to do whatever s/he needs. To get out of the way instead of forcing the developer to do something in a particular way.
That’s great. Thanks very much. You should write a series of blog posts or videos to walk through your code and how you built it :)
