Very cool. I did not know that. 
Eh, there's a time and a place. I have some envs with a relatively robust base env because that just makes things easier. It's important to know when to break off... but it isn't as binary as you're making it out to be.
Funny that this is posted the same day https://www.anaconda.com/blog/developer-blog/python-data-visualization-2018-why-so-many-libraries/
Take this to /learnpython Also it might help if u actually mention the website.
Pyenv!
[This](https://connect.fontys.nl/instituten/fhtenl/studies/LOG/Pages/default.aspx) is the website. I tried scavanging the internet extensivelly for a way to achieve similar result as wget using python. But with no luck &amp;#x200B;
fyi you should really be using virtual environments. 
I found Fluent to be more valuable to really read so I might put it first. It's presented in a way that I found easier to digest and retain. Effective I skimmed after a while and used more as a reference. But either way, these books were invaluable.
Show some love for Arch which has been doing that [since 2010](https://www.archlinux.org/news/python-is-now-python-3/).
So you think because you proclaimed something to be a "fallacy", that's really true? No further arguments needed :-) And ignoring three guys getting "married" in Columbia (I mean it's on BBC news). A few days ago, Japanese man appears to have "married" a hologram. Love is love, no?
Always do research before posting. I asked this 1 week ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9us66v/a_spoonful_of_advanced_python_per_day/
After struggling with jruby logstash for weeks (Not fast enough, limited regex splitting, slow startup), I wrote a client using gzip context manager and requests module directly to elasticsearch's \_bulk rest endpoint. Logstash managed 400 loglines/sec. With python I got 12000. 
&gt; So you think because you proclaimed something to be a "fallacy", that's really true? No, it means your argument doesn't make sense. You're not arguing for anything. You still haven't provided any case in the Python community that anybody needs to be worried about. You just arguing against respecting other people's choices. Having gay people marry or if you prefer a law from 50 years ago, a white person and a black person couldn't get married, doesn't mean that we need to worry about polygamy or that you have to marry a cat. &gt; A few days ago, Japanese man appears to have "married" a hologram. Love is love, no? So... getting "married" is not actually getting married. You can have a ceremony and be polygamous and not have any extra rights because the courts did not certify it. Why do you care if some dude masturbates to a hologram?
If you have a proper requirements.txt file for your PyCharm project, it will do the installation for you if you open it up. When building a project, I add entries into requirements.txt and install into the venv that way, so I know they are tracked.
Do you create a new virtualenv just to test a few lines of code that you might never use again? Sometimes it's just handy to run a python console or script without having to jump through the hoops.
Yeah? Can I finally install a php version higher than 5.3 without having to resort to black magic fuckery or a 3rd party repo? I can install 7.2 on RHEL7 but using it is another story all together. 
&gt;If you are about to ask a "how do I do this in python" question, please try r/learnpython or the Python discord. Show your code. No one can help you without seeing your code. Prepare a minimal working example, meaning the shortest version that replicates the problem. 
The best way for me to learn a language is to do a mini project. Find out what modules u are more intrested in and try to write something usefull or fun. For example try web scraping, 2D game or try to play with the sys module file handling.
You can copy the contents of the old site-packages folder to the new site-packages folder. This may break libraries with compiled components, but that can be fixed by just reinstalling them with pip.
What is PTF in this context?
&gt;&gt;You just arguing against respecting other people's choices despite &gt;&gt;you arguing for letting other people do what they want...how does that work? If you are truly respecting people's choice, then 3-homosexuals marrying (as the case in Colombia), or a man marrying a hologram, is equally valid choice as yours. It's only that you want to deny to other, smaller minorities relative to you, what you want to secure for yourself.
You can make cool wall papers. 
itertools and collections, yes!
What I'm trying to say is that trying to improve `argparse` in this way is probably not worth your (or anyone else's) time. It kind of does what it's supposed to, outside of cases when it doesn't, but then you can bring in some duct tape and then it kind of does it anyways. I'm struggling to imagine a program, where its command-line interface would be the main goal. Maybe designing a better library for argument parsing is an interesting task, but in my cost/benefit analysis it would never come up as a worthwhile thing to do. There's always a more important thing.
Thanks! 
Figure out different tasks you do everyday (sending a report in an email, downloading a file from location) and automate it. If you would like I would be more than happy to tutor you for short periods if your flexible.
Hi. How long have you been programming? It looks great.
&gt; Yes. If you're Etruscan. Well, this is a kind of joke that, despite your stellar reflexes... Etruscan language is a dead language nobody really reads or uses for anything outside of, maybe, one or two historians of language. The funny bit about it is that most of the legacy left in this language has never being deciphered. So, writing in this language is an entirely useless (but mostly impossible) skill, just like 99.99% of Unicode table. What do you mean when you say "installing locale"? I'm not familiar with the procedure. Oh, and why exactly should I be begging for your attention? Because you are so... much more... what?
Will RHEL 7 upgrade to Python3?
Can I get a link for the picture you have here? 
Unlikely - it's still using YUM3, which was written for Python2 and never converted. RHEL8 uses YUM4, which is mostly C++ with a thin glue layer on top for the interfacing, so it was much more easily converted. Note that you *can* install Python 3 side by side with Python 2 (that's what I have set up on my work computer). But the `python` command will always be Python 2 on RHEL7, and you have to run `python3` to get the newer.
I have one called “experiment” that I use as a catch-all for all those tiny little tests. 
This kind of thing is obnoxious and ought not be condoned, in my opinion. Once a comment disappears, you can lose important information and/or context from a seemingly trivial comment, and that even assumes that the person deleting comments even checks them first. Reddit isn't a platform designed around disappearing comments.
Geopandas
read all medium.com blogs titled "doing &lt;something&gt; with &lt;flask|django|web framework du jour&gt; and &lt;some library&gt; to enhance your personal brand" which will largely be more ironic gifs than words and basically boil down to importing the module and calling the public api just like the docs say(docs don't contain gifs though in general). ;)
This progarm is mainly for fun and educational purposes. One can combine several algorithms into a single animation. It also implements the LZW compression used in gif specification. So it's a “hodgepodge” of algorithms.
PySimpleGUIQt now supports both PySide2 and PyQt5. It will attempt to import PySide2 and if that fails will fall back to PyQt5. 
So, Red Hat looks like any other lightweight linux distro. So, why choose Red Hat? 
If you are missing a package, PyCharm will prompt you to install it if it can find a match in pypi. If you create a requirements.txt file, PyCharm will prompt you to add packages you import as well. Just go through your files and use the quick actions on underlined dependencies. 
Go online and watch PyCon talks about whatever seems interesting. Raymond Hettinger and David Beazely are always a must-see. 
Hi! You might have noticed in my post that your thoughts here about disappearing comments are the biggest concern I've noted, and I developed a whitelisting system specifically to help people save posts they think are important. Right now, there is nothing stopping anyone from deleting their posts, whether they use my application to do so or reddit's base interface. Thank you for your thoughts, though!
can't for all my bash scripts to stop working until I specify which python they need to call
Says in README: &gt;Makes pretty strong assumptions about OS. Might work on other POSIX / UNIX OS's. Windows is a hard no. What OS does it for sure work on? I can't seem to find that.
Again, that's not a quote. &gt; This means I'm quoting something. If I put what you say in here, that soesn't make sense. &gt;&gt; unless I put it here. A man having an un-state sanctioned ceremony to marry a hologram does not bother me. I'm still waiting for the problem with accepting blacks or women or gays or trans into the PSF. This is not a political issue like marriage. What's the problem if say a man who marries a hologram is a good programmer and wants to be part of the PSF?
Respectfully, I think you missed my point. People are spectacularly bad at identifying what might be important to other people, especially when you're talking about potentially thousands of comments over long periods of time, and aside from that, mass-deleting comments is not the point of being able to delete a comment you've made. As far as I'm concerned, comments should only be deleted if they are against the rules, subreddit or site-wide, or if they reveal some sort of sensitive information. Otherwise, why bother commenting in the first place? This policy of automatically removing all comments unless specifically saved contributes nothing to the community and actively disrupts access to information that might benefit other users. If you don't want your comments to be archived for other people to read, don't post them. If you want to contribute to a conversation, why should access to that be time-limited? What possible benefit is there in mass-deleting comments like this?
Recently discovered PyEnv, it's the shit. That and their auto activating venvs are totally kick ass!
Hello! I'm a bot! It looks to me like your post might be better suited for r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. That said, I am a bot and it is hard to tell.

Linux. I will change the readme to be more specific. It probably works on BSD and such, but I've not tested it. It's tested on Ubuntu 16.04 in Terminator using Bash and python 3.7, but I see no reason other versions of Linux / other terminal emulators won't work.

I'm kinda in the same boat. What I'm doing is reading a lot of the documentation (the libraries reference) and trying to implement the things that I find interesting... And when I find it even more interesting, I search for videos in the topic, which causes to take me to another videos and so on...
docopt!
Yes
I don't hear you fighting for this guy to have a state-sanctioned ceremony to marry a hologram? Are his feeling less worth than yours? Should he have less rights than you? Love is love, no?? 
Yes! This is very valuable for larger projects, it helps to find many bugs early on and as a bonus it also makes autocomplete work and helps with tools that automate refactoring.
Creating a zip of all the images means you can save as a cbz format instead of pdf (it is just a renamed zip file) and those are more portable than pdf files and the same quality as the original files.

You asked a good question. In a nutshell, look_at function is for transforming the world space to eye space; perspective_project function is for projecting those 3D vertices to a 2D panel. I learned it from these two accessible awesome essays http://www.songho.ca/opengl/gl_camera.html#lookat http://www.songho.ca/opengl/gl_projectionmatrix.html
No, that's not how RHEL works.
For smaller/simple projects, I love [dataset](https://dataset.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
Can you be more specific with your problem? I've read the OP and the comments here but I'm not seeing where exactly the issue is. So, let's start with: forget about the current project at hand. Let's focus on loops as a general concept. What are currently the biggest questions in your mind surrounding them?
Just typing your Python script shebang w/o a version at the end is like denying climate change is real. All the evidence was there, you knew this was coming and, more than just doing nothing, actively sabotaged yourself. Bet you use the system Java and act shocked when things go tango uniform. /r/python circlejerk
I think you're perhaps a little too focused on one specific tool here, and phrasing the question oddly as a result. What I think you're really asking is: &gt;"How do I make a GUI text box with readline like features?" Is that correct? Or do you actually *have* to use readline specifically, for some reason?
Why would they rewrite a package utility in C++. Does anyone know?
It's the other way around, static typing removes the need not for all but for many tests.
Just make a video explaining your learning experience and offering "tips" etc. That's all. Any more you'd probably be wasting time and doing a disservice.
wow do you work and sleep ? LOL. you certainly seem to have done a lot in mere 2.5 years. &gt; used APIs of Dropbox, Facebook and PRAW for Reddit to do things which deeply thrilled me. Like what ?

Also, the last example I have given will change in-place, which I have clearly mentioned in the snippet itself. 
Humane... the word you're looking for is humane. So much more humane. Than you, specifically. Thoroughly amazing how the point of "if you're Etruscan" just completely sailed over your head there. I mean really, really baffling that you even could miss it by that much. But thank you for wasting time and energy on informing the world of what it already knows. Also, if you're going to quote someone, actually quote them, I never once said "_installing_ locale", so I can't imagine why I'd need to explain how to do it. As I am -- perhaps wrongly -- assuming you well know, the act of _setting_ your locale does not _install_ Etruscan characters or fonts that support them. Anyone like you who is happy to work pathologically in C.ASCII will be just as happy to work in C.UTF-8 _and will never even notice_ that the setting changed underneath them, except perhaps via seeing Click work. This isn't an arguable point, since every character they already use will remain exactly the same, down to the number of bytes they consume. That is what makes this entire thrust of your argument senseless and moot.
This is awesome. You know what you should do? Browse a few popular github repos and generate bugs based on how many issues they have! It might make for an interesting visualization on /r/dataisbeautiful!

Pyenv can still default your shell to whatever python you want and if you break it all with bad ideas, you can then just go back and make another one with no consequences. I use pipenv a good bit for doing what you mention, it’s pretty handy
Too vague. What are you trying to build? Is it a GUI app? Is it a web based app? When you say interfacing with other system, do you mean using an API? or using a COM interface? You don't pick a language. Your project picks a language(s) based on requirements.
I don't want to be rude, but a sentence that starts this way prepares you for the inevitable, doesn't it?. It certainly sounds like your team wants to handle people's money, and it also sounds like your team is also quite inexperienced. Inexperienced to the point of not being opinionated in terms of what language to use, and not recognizing that existing infrastructure you want or wish to interact with often dictates this choice. Professionals are always opinionated - in fact, one hires them precisely because they have informed opinions on complex topics one know little about. I respectfully suggest that a team that cannot answer this question internally is not qualified to write software that handles financial transactions, and you should seek professional software consulting advice.

I think docopt is an interesting library and which is less verbose. Click is simply syntactic sugar for me.
This is hardly a challenge compared to what I usually have to work with, though. first = 'X-DSPAM-confidence:0.8475' number_index = first[::-1].index(':') number_str = first[len(index)-number_index:] number = float(number_str) name = input("Username: ").capitalize() sentence = 'Bob went on a long walk up the hill with some hope' chars = [0, 8, 11, 14, -1] print("".join([sentence[char] for char in chars])) split_sentence = sentence.split() I'll say, though, that this looks like a homework assignment.

Yeah I know that, my beef is the fact that to have a plot with point connected with a line I have to do something like: s1.circle(x, y) s1.line(x, y) I cannot understand why there's no option like "connect=True" in circle or any other glyph....
No: within a single major release, that kind of upgrade should never happen, because Python 2 and Python 3 are not interchangeable. The theory is, develop a system to run on e.g. version 7, it will continue to run on all releases of version 7.

Programming language can be useful for any career. 1. Programming is a skill, if you can learn a language properly you can use same principal in your real life to solve various problems. 2. You can automate your daily task too. so, my suggestion is grab a book. read a chapter and then try everything you have learned from that chapter. i believe you can progress by making programming project based on your level. let say you know how to print hello world string and how to take user input. Now make a project about user profile (name, age, sex...), where user input there details and print out those data nice formatted way. &amp;#x200B; you have learned loop, now make a project about taking multiple user profile and printing them.
Neat. I am working on somewhat related project (very beginning stages) of “kali-izing” Fedora Linux, (since there aren’t any RedHat/Cent based pentesting distros that I have been able to find). Basically the end goal is to have all the Kali tools have individual shell script files that install them on Fedora, then a master script that executes all the individual scripts. So one could run the master and have all the tools, or could edit the master and comment out tools they don’t want then run it. https://github.com/drewblay/black-fedora

I've heard these called typographical comments, but I'm not coming up with references to that now. I thought PEP 8 mentioned this at one time, but don't see it there. The old Delphi style guide once made a mention of it. The new one on Embarcadero just has this: &gt;The Delphi team prefers to keep comments of this type as spare and simple as possible. For instance, you should avoid using asterisks to create patterns or lines inside your comments. [Object Pascal Style Guide - 5.1 Block Comments](http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/10280#5.1) I used to do it a lot when I was younger, and even had keyboard macros in my text editor to insert short lines, long lines, and full-on program and function header blocks, completely outlined in asterisks! That was back before syntax highlighting editors were common and it helped distinguish sections of the code. Not as necessary now, but I still put in short 3 and 10 character separators sometimes. Maybe just nostalgia, and they were a pain to update, but I did like the graphic-design/ASCII-art quality of those big function headers! &amp;#x200B;

Embarking on my \#100DaysOfCode from today. I want to specifically learn things in python that I have not spent time with. Spent the day writing ORM models for Redmine so that I can extract any data from it. I have used sqlalchemy in the past but never like this. I'm feeling proud of my accomplishment! 
&gt; whenever I need to use it I just copy that file into my project folder and then import it in my main app file Curious... Why don't you spend time learning how to package this module so that you can use it later? That way you can track any changes or improvements. I have a module for myself for development. You can just build the wheel and keep it locally, without putting it on pypi so you don't have to bother maintaining it. But it will help you track what changes you've made or rather what improvements you make. Call it your own devtools module. Sorry for assuming but if you don't know how to write a setup.py file, I can help. I didn't know how to write one till recently and learning it has changed my outlook on python drastically. I write pip installable packages all the time. It makes my life so much easier.
I am currently following python bootcamp by colt steele and its pretty good for an intro level. I have also heard about Jose Portillas various courses on Udemy as well . They say hes a great instructor so im gonna check him out.
You could make use of a dataset on women in tech (e.g. by regions of country, specific domains - medicine, media..., ). Introduce anaconda/jupyter and work through a data overview, cleaning, visualization example from within jupyter. panda dataframes head/tail, describe. replace some nulls. create some calculated columns. visualize with seaborn, matplotlib Mix in a little markdown documentation, an embedded image, video, formatted formula. commit to a public repo such as github at the end with the url they can return to. 
Oooh this is something I want to see. I love pihole. 
He means the keys used in key:value pairs, not the dictionary method `dict.keys()`. In this dict `d = ["a": 1}`, `"a"` is the key and `1` is the value. You can only use immutable objects as keys and since frozensets are immutable(frozen), they can be used as keys. `d = {frozenset([1,2,3]): "hello"}` Also dict.keys() returns a dict view object which is essentially a frozen set anyway.
FYI, peewee is a great library that includes a [dataset clone](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#dataset) among other useful interfaces.

What a tool you are.
Totally agree with you. None of the current team has actually worked on financial transactions before—we will be hiring a specialized team that would work on it. However, I was personally interested in being active developer in this system. I know it’d be challenging enough that would level up my skills.
I actually it wouldn’t work, but I wasn’t sure as to why exactly would it. I’ve being studying Monzo experience (Monzo.com). They have written most of their infrastructure in Go. But, as I mentioned earlier we will be hiring expert specialized team that works on financial systems and I asked this question to narrow down our searching list. 
Do random things to your external facing network to see if you can get anywhere naughty. 
I can assist with this. I have a custom Fedora box with a bunch of pentesting tools. 
Thanks for these points. I’d definitely read more about these specialized routing and settlement softwares. About the python part, totally agree with you. I believe gmalto have a python wrapper around their HSM system. 
I just picked up 2 courses from Jose Portillas on Udemy, his Complete Python Bootcamp, and his Complete SQL Bootcamp.

Strings concatenated with + range for loops
&gt; Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines. &gt; Method definitions inside a class are surrounded by a single blank line.
what is better for loops than range if you need an index?
Yeah, it's their programming language of their choice. Also we need to steal the nasa code
Oooooh Snap! 
I was just about to post this! 
You never need \_just\_ an index, you always use it to do something else. In the case of this screenshot it appears to loop through and toggle all the switches according to the bit flags received as argument. So here it may just be the most appropriate use. But generally you want to loop over the items you use and if you really need an index variable using \`enumerate\` to add the counter. On another note, they appear to be writing the same code again in the function above.
It's more a technique for helping others get into the zone, but depending on application, useful for self checking to force you to ensure you're making meaningful progress. My mind likes to wander or I say yes to every distraction that comes my way, getting into no grove or accomplishing nothing. For me, having that clock helps me to stay on task or say no until its up. I'm in high availability software support, so the pace is extremely fast and high in distraction, but my role is to hammer on hard issues. Having this technique as a tool helps me to manage the organic tasks and all the input. 
If you look closely it says UNREGISTERED, made the whole video more authentic for me. 
That's hilarious, good catch!
Not a sublime lover, use PyCharm or VsCode, but love the color scheme :-) And that unregistered on the top... well :-)
Can you point out specific flaws?
But would it be interpreted by actuators and motors and processors? I thought for real life, physical application, Python is the worst language.
Yeah I'm not a fantastic programmer but I noticed this too lol. Are people's lives depending on these coders? 
Look up angr/binary analysis platform
It's written in ruby, everyone in /r/python gets confused
Python is used for scripts I'm pretty sure they use something else for that.
Wait. You can enumerate into a tuple of the index and the element??? Why have I never learned this? I don’t ever use enumerate. Thanks for the example!
To start, self.ui.tc[1-8] should be a list, which will make the function being edited not a complete abomination. 
My opinion: The SetValue stuff etc. should've been wrapped so you can just set it via an assignment. The # comments should go completely and instead they should write docstrings.
At a general level the language doesn't matter. You can write a good, secure, and functional system to do this with Python. On a more realistic level, there will likely be methods, libraries, and experts already used to build these sorts of systems. These methods, libraries, and experts will constrain the language you use.
Looks like it's cmake
f-strings help to avoid the ugly .format methods
Lol for the vid Yep I know but assumed the one in the pic was a custom one hence asking the name :-)
_that wasn't supposed to be there_
Ahahahah then it’s even better ahahahahhah
Ah ok it is the material theme I gave up on it as was not of my liking for powershell stuff but given most of the time I use sapien tool or visual studio for posh development I will give it another spin :-) Thanks!
I didn’t know NASA uses windows
I kind of get the idea. You go from more general to specific. The narrower object inhetit the "stuff" of the more general. Fish get gills, dalmon gets gill and fresh water traits. I think once you get to see it in more practical application instead of a theory it will click. I mean learning about game engines and the scenes of the text based game following the chapter introducting the concept kind of made things a bit clearer. I am going to try to make a simplified game trying to see if i can get it to work.
Oh, I never knew that, my bad. I guess we learn something new everyday :)
So you’re saying it should be something like **self.ui.tc[x] = value**?
Thanks a lot mate! I'm an undergrad student with loads of free time and I did spend quite some time playing with Python. I just work on personal projects to solve the needs or interests I have. Though as I'm about to finish my 5th sem now it seems like the skills I have gained aren't the most sought after for hiring. Things like competitive coding seem to be more valued than project work and while I enjoy DS and algorithm I can't get myself to put in the same effort as I'm not as passionate about them.
Why not? I code on windows everyday. Linux is too annoying for my personal taste.
Who said anything about linux.
Am I the only person in the world who uses Atom? :/
They like how slow it is and hate how efficient Linux/BSD is. As always it's subar and a waste of funds.
Neovim on OpenBSD ;)
I heard some time ago that they use it for analyzing rover's logs among other things. Probably read it on python's website
yes - so to recreate the same functionality that they have in the on_rio_status function you would do: for i, t in enumerate(temps): self.ui.tc[i] = t Two lines instead of however many variables they are editing.
Found the link [https://www.python.org/about/success/usa/](https://www.python.org/about/success/usa/)
Compiled C/C++ is usually what's burned to rad-hardened EEPROM and sent into space to interface with the hardware. However, python is commonly used for test frameworks, ground systems, development tooling, integration testing, data analysis, simulations, etc. There's a lot more software that goes into a successful mission than just the uplinked binary.
for tc, temp in zip(self.ui.tcs, temps): tc.setValue(temp) Is how I would write it. Assuming they're always the same length, of course. Eric they probably are given the way the code is written right now. 
That would be great. Submit a pull request.
Wow I didn't even know f-strings have existed since 3.6. It seems I have finally found the perfectly lazy way to format strings.
snakes on a spaceship
Mostly Visual Studio Code, but also Vim.
Vim with plugins and custom config. (At the moment I'm still testing Neovim and don't know if I'm changing yet.)
I love them. You can do cool shit with them too like &gt;&gt;&gt;book = 2 &gt;&gt;&gt;print(f'I have {book} book{"s" if book &gt; 1 else ""}') I have 2 books &gt;&gt;&gt;book = 1 &gt;&gt;&gt;print(f'I have {book} book{"s" if book &gt; 1 else ""}') I have 1 book
&gt;I'm not reliable for any deaths
WingIDE Pro. Best multithread debugging available. 
Yeah, they keep developing it just for you.
`self.conair` feels like a name I would make for an air control script.
Vim
r/learnpython read our sidebar for how to properly format your code so that it will render correctly.
vim for quick and dirty, vscode or pycharm depending on where I am.
I actually love it, but it's soooo slow to start, that I moved to VSCode
I actively *want* to use Atom, but I *need* my editor to not choke when I open large files. If I didn't have that problem, I likely would use it.
Vim w/Vundle and other plugins 
Yeah that's what I was thinking too. Is this a normal thing? I mean mum did tell me once that I was special but I really didn't expect the devs to go this far.
thanks Kumashiro! So,\[None\]\*(1+n) is a list of none elements. Why does it make it?
So cool. My current Python Professor used to work for NASA as a programmer. So he claims. 
I agree with this guy. Use Google chrome Dev tools fine the see more button and request the link that is attached. 
Got sick of trying to read traceback a couple of days ago: [https://pypi.org/project/pretty-errors/](https://pypi.org/project/pretty-errors/) &amp;#x200B;
Wow I was using shelve till now for quick scripts but I might consider dataset now.
Bingo.
Yes, I can imagine that Python is a popular choice for APIs and scripting, but the actual transaction processing tends to be done on dedicated machines running mainframe OSs. So, think IBM's Z/OS, OpenVMS, Solaris, and so on.
It doesn't look very Pythonic though 
See the second line in fib(), checking that memo[n] is not None? If the array didn't have n+1 elements to start, that'd throw an exception. None is used as a "flag" value to indicate that fib() hasn't already calculated the corresponding value.
What plugins and config? I can't imagine the effort it would take to set up and maintain a vim config which could be close to as powerful as pycharm, but I would really really like to give it a go because pycharm is so expensive once you graduate...
I will concede that Metasploit has gotten a little complicated over the years. IMHO we should be teaching young hackers to build their own tools. Maybe this project will be a good example project?
PyCharm pro (free for students). It's configurable, discoverable, the plugin ecosystem is great, and intuitive, and easy to search, and highly compatible. Cross-platform too. You should try VScode, it's just Atom but better. Can't wait for Xray though.
Oh yeah, I use the logging all the time. I was just trying to show a simple example.
Would that be any different from the following? self.ui.tc = temps Don't have an interpreter handy for a while to try it myself.
Format is considered ugly? I use it all the time :(
Thanks yoda.
Looks like code to control or monitor a 3D printer. References temps and gcode. 
Visual Studio
PyCharm Pro - all day, every day.
your self worth.
Anyone else notice “conair” and wonder if their gonna throw a load of convicts on the rocket and let them take it over
I was just giving my opinion of why someone (nasa) could choose one system over another using myself as a test subject (I hate linux, hence I use windows).
Troll, is that you?
r/learnpython
Looks written by folks who are busy accomplishing things aside from manicuring their code for a beauty contest. 
Looks like LabView on the right there. Neat.
From research, I got to this: ps\_string = " Get-Mailbox -resultsize unlimited | search-Mailbox -searchQuery 'from:\*' , 'to:\*' -DeleteContent ......" ps\_string.replace("\*" , "(Here I need it to pick up the first email in the column)") This is where I need help!
I see. ISO 8583 is more of a standard than interface. You will probably end up working with Java, most probably JPOS framework. There are companies like IBM and Microsoft who provide their own framework as well. When I was working on POS machines, we were using ANSI C. 
_self_ is a reference to the object instance. _getValue_ is something Java developers do. 
Hello! I'm a bot! I see someone has already suggested going to r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. I highly recommend posting your question there. Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster. Show /r/learnpython the code you have tried and describe where you are stuck. **[Be sure to format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F)** and include which version of python and what OS you are using. *** ^(this bot is written and managed by /u/IAmKindOfCreative) ^(This bot is currently under development and experiencing changes to improve its usefulness)
??? Do you have more information? This seems a bit sketchy: the total number of packages in a distro is probably somewhere between 10k and 100k which is a fairly small graph. I don't see how python's speed would be a limiting factor here
I don't think they're using python as you say. Probably C. But I don't really know
Nah the code is fine getattr(self.ui, 'tc{}'.format(i)).setValue(temps[i])
What Linux distribution are you using?
Blows my mind the same language i started learning is used by nasa. Makes me feel like a child reading a pop-up book while dad is reading 1984. 
It's Ubuntu 18.04 LTS 64bit

*Cracks knuckles* Since you asked (and I'm bored): * As others mentioned, the `on_rio_status` method is disgusting. Some sort of list/dict to manage those assignments would make that much more manageable. * The variable names are all terrible. Never use 'temp' for anything. If it's really temporary you probably don't need to assign it in the first place (just use the source of the resulting value in-line). If it's not really temporary but an actual parameter, give it a meaningful name. Same with `val`, `idx`, `sw`, etc. * No type hints on arguments or return types. There's no clear way to tell what version of python they're using, but if they're using 3.3+ and NOT using type hints, they're doing it wrong. * The size of this single text file is absolutely massive. And since this is clearly UI code, that's a hint that this tool has no good design work being put into the front-end of the tool (meaning the backend probably isn't much better). A better design would be to break a lot of what's on screen up into separate modules then have some kind of UI management code to assemble it at run-time. * Serious mixing of responsibilities. This code is responsible for setting up and manipulating the UI, AND calculating values to show, AND configuring the themes/color. All of those responsibilities belong in separate classes with clear layers of segregation between them. * Looking at the code mini-map, you can see a lot of blocks of code that look like multiple lines of very similar code. This suggests even more code like `on_rio_status` with lots of 'line 1 line 2 line 3 etc' like code. * There are magic numbers EVERYWHERE. Some of them I could maybe handwave away as context-specific (the RGB values, for example), but even then, explicit is better than implicit. But what the hell is that equation on line 634? Why does the RPM value you need to be converted from what was passed to the UI to `val / 58.85 / 8192. * 60.`. Are the order of operations in that equation even correct? What do those values represent in this context? Even if everyone on the team would always have enough context to recognize that as a conversion function for RPM, their brain still has to make that connection every single time they read that line. At the VERY least i would move the equation into another method so I could give it a name. * Comments in weird places where they provide little value, and not in crucial places where they'd add a ton (like the above equation, for example). * `open_file`implies it's a generic file picker, but the comment on the method states it's only for gcode files. Either gcode files are the ONLY thing this tool works with, or this methods name is too general for the work it actually does. Either way, it needs a better name. * Inconsistent naming styles. Some functions/methods are snake_case and some are CamelCase. Now, this makes sense if their projects style guide says snake_case but they're calling PyQt (which appears they're using) which has its own naming style. But that hints at yet ANOTHER smell... * ...wrap your dependencies. For whatever functionality PyQt offers, it helps to have an adapter layer for that component. Not only does that give you better control over how to interact with the UI library (letting you write an API that makes sense for YOUR application), but it also makes sit somewhat trivial to swap out UI layers if at some point there's a bug or missing feature or something that prevents you from implementing new functionality, forcing a switch. * Commented out lines of code. Either this photo was taken in the middle of him debugging something, which, to be fair, is entirely possible, or they're not trusting their VCS and they should just delete commented lines and use VCS to restore them if they turn out to be needed later. All in all, this feels exactly like a project written by an engineer/scientist/other non-software-developer. It's code that technically works and their passing ability to code lets them write something that gets their job done. But it's not something a well-trained SDE would write. At least, not unless it was contract work :P
sounds about right for government 
If you mean username its: artur@arturS &amp;#x200B;
They will be accomplishing much more with maintainable and readable code that is easy to debug, test and read. This is why we have spaghetti code in a lot of places that makes our life miserable. We should not repeat the mistakes of the past. It is the compilers job to unwrap loops and replace values not a humans. In the case of python of course there are issues with that but for mummy there is numba or so I’ve heard.
It is scary how much extra work and misery people have to suffer because of this approach. Thank god for the 20% that does it right, keeps the world moving forward.
You can enumerate lists and other data structures as well. It's cleaned my code up a ton
How big of files are you trying to open?
Pandas
This is why I love code reviews (like yours, when done right). Too bad in school they don't usually do reviews for just about anything, other than simply slapping on a score and call it a day.
I didn’t care for Atom. I use Geany for Python and VS for C#.
Honestly, I strongly suggest giving VsCode a try. It's very similar, but lighter.
&gt; Never use 'temp' for anything. What about temperature?
I wonder if they're evaluated on KLOCs.
It's OK, I'm sure your code has a great personality :/
Ok. I menaged to add the --user-data-dir argument, but it creates a lots of mess in my directory is there any way to reduce number of files produced by vscode after adding alternate data directory as my virtualenv directory? &amp;#x200B;
A question like this is asked like once every 15 minutes. Just search.
Fair points, and I understand your thoughts. However I do have several reasons why I think this might be useful for certain users on reddit: 1. To prevent doxing. This has proven to be a big issue on reddit, and the more controversial opinions or posts you have the more likely you are to be targeted. Having a smaller post history creates a smaller target of attack. This could be useful for someone who's worried about getting doxxed over their political opinions or even someone who fears an oppressive government or regime combing through their comments to try and identify them. 2. To prevent comment history scraping. I think we've all seen some comment on reddit that starts with "well I went through your post history and found this comment from three years ago that contradicts...". This would stop that. Perhaps this program doesn't make sense for a reddit account that contributes to a non-controversial informative subreddits (like /r/python or /r/programming), but it could be useful for discussion of sensitive or controversial topics, or perhaps the user who posts on /r/sex or in other subreddits like that and doesn't want to have a trail of comments that might get tracked back to them that reveal sensitive information. On the twitter side of things, I think one look at the [James Gunn controversy](https://variety.com/2018/film/news/james-gunn-fired-from-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-1202879817/) illustrates why this could be useful on that website. Twitter seems to be mainly focused on current events, I don't think it's common to go back to old tweet or tweet threads so I don't see it being as disruptive as it could be on reddit.
It doesn't take too much imagination to understand how it translates
SCL?
Atom sucks. Get vscode
I would name that variable `num_books` rather than `book`, personally. I'm not a pro though... But yeah, generally the ability to put expressions of any type into f-strings is pretty awesome.
Yeah. That’s always my problem.
Oh, a jack of all trades, master of ... ;)
Big. 
You can tell by the way it isn't.
I really pity you if you are working with anything bigger than 50 megabytes, which is really the most I can get to. If you have a program that size in one file, that's really terrible.
I'll say, do people consider Vim/Sublime/VSC as IDE? I feel like they are souped up text editors. PyCharm/MSVS are what I personally consider IDE.
Or used for loops.
Thank you for clearifing. I could use any resources i can find to get proficient in python. Look forward to reading the article. Im going to try to create a game similare to the one in exercise 43 of the book and post it on githyb and get some feedback. 
Microsoft Windows. How unfortunate.
I think you still have the problem that your user has root privileges which is never recommended. 
Try typing _exit_ and enter. (Only once) And redo whatever you were doing. Do not type _sudo_ or _su_ before any commands.
Using python on any vessel is just asking for something to go wrong. There is no way they'd use a dynamically-typed scripting language for anything mission-critical.
I highly doubt they use Python for onboard systems - I'm pretty sure they run a highly constrained subset of C (no while loops, for example), or Ada. Hopefully Ada.
CSI computer expert (me): "I'm using stolen NASA code to hack the mainframe."
Ok no problem
 things = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"] for i, thing in enumerate(things): print("index: {}, thing: {}".format(i, thing)) just looks not as nice as things = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"] for i, thing in enumerate(things): print(f"index: {i}, thing: {thing}".) does
 print(f'I have {book} book{"s" * (book &gt; 1)})
I started in January of 2018 so about 11 months but from March to may I didn’t do anything with it cuz I was so confused. Then once I came back it kind of clicked.
IIRC you can put relatively arbitrary expressions into f-strings because the compiler literally translates f-strings into a matching str.format call. They're syntactic sugar. Still, I wish the tooling I use at work was on 3.6+ instead of still stuck on 2.7...
It could be anything really. I think rockets aren't just deploy some C code, and maybe they use python for something else here on earth
It looks like PyQt stuff for visualization and control of some kind of 3d printing or machining equipment. There's a method there for opening/saving gcode (think 3d printers or machining), references to an extruder, and rpm's. There's also color gradient calculation for display. All using Qt stuff for the UI. 
It's very obviously temperature. 
Okay, but I don't see why you should be *editing* those files. Viewing them, certainly, but why use an editor for logs, autogenerated code? Data, maybe, but still. Why not use something like `sed -n 10,30p log` to print lines 10-30, and pygmentize for syntax highlighting that? Probably faster than any major IDE out there.
You can run it via SCL but to get it to operate smoothly upon boot is a gigantic pain in the ass. 
If it was that universally obvious to everyone with no context we wouldn't be having this conversation.
Yeah it was an example I wrote up in a hurry. 
Cool stuff. Is the * a short-hand for an if statement? I haven't seen this kind of thing yet
Half of that is somewhere between speculation and wrong. I'm just going to point out that I can tell more about what this code is doing and why, than about 90% of the in-production python code I've seen in the real world in exchange for a paycheck... and that's from one hazy screenshot. Moral of the story is nobody should get down on themselves after reading posturing posts on reddit. 
His isn’t 4chan 
lol?
Learning about enumerate changed my life. 
Spyder, via Anaconda. I did my due diligence in researching "which IDE is best" and as like most of you, I determined that everyone has their own preference. I decided that it doesnt matter which you us, but rather which you become most comfortable with and can EFFECTIVELY use to wrote the codes which you seek to write. I'm no more than a beginner programmer, so don't take it as if I know more than anyone else. But do consider that you dedication to learning. and deliberate practice of your programming skills, matter more than whichever IDE you chose to use Ultimately, I urge you to just pick one and go with it. Go with it and once you develop sufficient knowledge of programming then you should experiment with which IDE offers you the best experiences.
Try 100k. My coworkers insist they need syntax highlighting for some nasty file. It's not even right...close, but not right.
Hey OP. If you want a more practical explanation, here's something I wrote earlier. It may help you understand one of the fundamental reasons why we use classes in programming. Imagine designing a game where there is one character with stats, and those stats could change depending on gameplay elements. An approach using functions only might look like this: def take_damage(health, wealth, magic): ... return health, wealth, magic def heal(health, wealth, magic): ... return health, wealth, magic def eat_food(health, wealth, magic): ... return health, wealth, magic player = (100, 100, 100) player = take_damage(*player) player = heal(*player) player = eat_food(*player) And so on. You are taking in and returning the same values. Now, let's see this with a class: class Player: def __init__(health, wealth, magic): self.health = health self.wealth = wealth self.magic = magic def take_damage(self): ... def heal(self): ... def eat_food(self): ... player = Player(100, 100, 100) player.take_damage() player.heal() player.eat_food() Because the player stats are instance variables and belong to `self`, you don't need to pass them in and out of the methods. Hence, the method signature is much cleaner.
In this case it's just the regular multiplication operator. In Python you can multiply strings by ints: print( "hello" * 3 ) # Prints "hellohellohello" Python can also implicitly convert between bools and ints, where True is 1 and False is 0, making this sort of thing work: print( "hello" * True ) # Prints "hello" print( "hello" * False ) # Prints ""
hardcoded constants everywhere programmer writing copy paste code (setvalue 8 times of values 0 to 7) most functions don't have docstrings wew
If you’ve got funding: Red Hat Software Collections has 7.2
&gt; And what about the random engineer on Reddit whose trying to read your code on a screenshot and has no domain knowledge of the scientific realm? I had no inkling that "temps" was anything but temporary since I have no context. The list is called temps, why calls a list of temporary values for temps? That doesn't make sense. It's very obviously temperatures, and if you are still in doubt, it says temperature 2 lines above the method.
Its not a specific mission. They're talking about their whole future architecture including commercial cargo and crew, SLS, Orion, LOP-G, and all the other stuff. It's good to note that for the last 15 years there has been a continuous loop of these projects starting, being delayed, stagnating, and being replaced with something basically the same but dissimilar enough to require starting over from scratch and being more expensive than the last, the whole thing is highly controversial.
oh, you're _funny_
For me it's more about understanding the details of how the tools work. It allows you to be adaptable and quickly build stuff or modify stuff that does things that aren't available off the shelf.
Get that camelCase out of here!

No worries. Also I checked through your code - it looks pretty fine :) Definitely nice uses of classes going on.

I could do it. I’ve worked on machine learning algorithms for use with fantasy football in the past, spent a lot of time on it. I’ve made time series models that predict player performance, and fantasy football team selection algorithms that uses a genetic algorithm to select the team based on the performance prediction from the other model. Already got the data for training too. $100/hr

I tried using Evil mode a while back, but gave up. Do you think it's worth learning? I'm currently running Tmux+Vim, but I've definitely heard good things about emacs.
That and being able to seamlessly switch between python, javascript, and go makes me very happy.
**tl;dr b1ackcat is full of shit and you shouldn't trust a bunch of smug assholes with no domain knowledge or any context of the code showing off to redditors how much better at coding they are than [NASA's coding standards](https://www.fastcompany.com/28121/they-write-right-stuff)** &gt; As others mentioned, the on_rio_status method is disgusting.

There is literally a person in the photo in front of the screen typing.
Seems like a very useful module, I will definitely learn it and see what I can do with it from there. Thank you for the info!
Definitely interesting. I did notice that if I try to change the axis limits within the loop, it will use the final limits instead. x = np.linspace(0, 2\*np.pi, 10) y = np.linspace(0, 2\*np.pi, 5) t = np.linspace(0, 4.9, 25) X, Y, T = np.meshgrid(x, y, t) U = np.cos(X+T) V = np.sin(Y+T) fig = plt.figure() camera = Camera(fig) for i in range(len(t)): plt.quiver(X[:,:,0],Y[:,:,0], U[:,:,i], V[:,:,i], units='inches', pivot='mid') a, b = plt.ylim() plt.ylim(a-1,b+1) camera.snap() animation = camera.animate(interval=50) animation.save('celluloid.mp4') I will explore this more. Also, I am the developer of [animatplot](https://github.com/t-makaro/animatplot), which is also for making animated plots with matplotlib. My library wraps `FuncAnimation`. I am intrigued by the use of `ArtistAnimation`.
Damn I've been using python for quite a while now and I've never thought of assigning to slices. I mean when I think about it now it totally makes sense. I don't know how I missed that. That's so logical and obvious.
I think I’m the only person in the world that uses Spyder!!
Haha that's the first thing I noticed... Painful to see
Oh! I see, how clever. I really dig this. Goddamn Python is such a beautiful language

Today I learned I'm actually an electrical engineer.
Fortunately they replaced the Windows on ISS with Linux... https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/155392-international-space-station-switches-from-windows-to-linux-for-improved-reliability
Linux is more annoying than than the built-in advertising in Windows 10? Or the forced updates and reboots? Or NTFS? 
The honest answer is that it's one of those things I know I *can* do, but not currently something I know *how* to do, and so it's just not in my current workflow. I'm not officially a programmer, my job is actually marketing related. But in the past year and a half I've come to realize how beneficial coding can be in this field. I've been using Python for about nine months (was using VBA for about eight months before that). My approach to learning has been almost entirely practical rather than academic. I did an Intro to VBA course about two years ago, and I'm currently doing a PostgreSQL with Python course in an effort to start learning databases, but those are the only two proper courses I've done. Everything else has been "I need to do X, if I don't know exactly how to get it done I'll hit Google and learn what I need to learn." So there are best practices (version control and virtual environments probably being the biggest two) where I'm aware of their existence, know what they are at an abstract level, and know that I *should* be using them, but haven't yet taken the time to learn the ins and outs and incorporate them into my workflow. Honestly I haven't yet felt the sting of their absence enough to put in the time and effort to learn them. Copy/pasting a .py file into a project folder every now and then just hasn't been a big enough hardship yet to make me seek out a better way (but with an upfront learning curve) yet. I definitely have felt the sting of my clusterfuck data situation though, and I've started to feel the sting of lacking version control, so those are currently the top priorities in terms of learning new skills and incorporating them into my workflow. I've actually been meaning to organize all these thoughts into a standalone post asking for general advice, so I'd definitely appreciate any feedback.
It's a PyQt GUI, not until common to see stuff like this is QT GUIs.
Using PyQT makes thing wonky sometimes. Everything is an object.
Interesting! Thanks for giving it a shot. I wonder if that's a limitation of `ArtistAnimation`. The code I took the idea from [mentions](https://github.com/has2k1/plotnine/blob/master/plotnine/animation.py#L33) that specifically as well. I'll have to experiment further. 
It doesn’t really matter. Just pick something and start building. Flask starts out a little simpler but ends up needing more pieces configure. Django comes with a little more out of the box but a little steeper learning curve. 
We don't code for legibility to strangers on the internet.
Hi, I'm clicked on your link. it redirected to GitHub profile, What I am supposed to look?
You know, I'm getting really sick of people just flat out ignoring my explicit call-outs that I'm exaggerating to prove a point. Obviously you shouldn't expect some stranger on the internet to read your code. You shouldn't expect *anyone* to read it. Except you or your co-workers. A year from now. After you've forgotten everything about how this piece of code works. **That** is who you are writing clear, readable, self-explanatory code for.
Can you explain more about the Supervisor? How it works with my application
I actually just started using spacemacs in the past few weeks after usually using vim with no additional plugins for the past few years (didn't even use tmux, just used `:tabnew` or a new terminal). I definitely like it a lot but there's been a bit of a learning curve, but no problems that aren't a quick search away. Personally, I mainly switched for [ess](https://ess.r-project.org/) interactivity to leave behind RStudio's subpar editing and since I currently have a handful of web projects which I usually don't do. For my use case it's been vim++ and I'm really happy I switched, but still just use vim for quick edits. It's definitely worth a shot from my perspective! But I'm one of those [math-focused developers](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2015#tech-editor).
NASA is a huge entity. He could've worked as a programmer designing their toilet seats mechanisms. Or writing simulations at JPL. Or anything really. Very probable that he isn't lying.
I disagree. The reader will always have some domain knowledge. &amp;#x200B; You don't hire someone fresh out of compsci 101 to write scientific code that manages a rocket booster or whatever it is. You hire someone with a related degree or work experience and a knack for coding. You don't hire someone who's only programming background is writing code for rocket boosters to write web apps.

If the code is for temperature sensors, it's pretty obvious what temp means, even if you've forgotten how the code works. This is just being silly 
Is that Mike Rowe’s voice?
I would love Atom but it is just SO slow
Boooo
I didn’t doubt him. He currently handles their programmer hiring for the NASA location in my area of CA. Let’s just say I’ve been going to all of his tutoring hours. 
I bought a license 7 years or so ago and have taken it with me thru Windows, Mac and Linux installs. I'm fond of VS Code and Jet Brains IDEs, but I'm always using sublime for its great search features. #endplug
Like stealing candy from a baby. 
because it’s updating the same keys “name”, “value”, etc in each iteration of the loop, you’ll only see what remains which is the last update. it sounds like you’re trying to flatten the dict?
I see. and yes I'm trying to flatten it. also, why did I get down voted? is this not the place for this kind of question? 
isn't it constructive criticism tho? and with every set of general guidelines there are exceptions so everybody throwing specific cases aren't actually arguing his point, the way i see it, there are reasons to think that the code above wasn't written by someone too proficient at SE and the review by blackcat is just bringing up those reasons ^of^course^I^could^be^wrong
Pipenv really is a trap. The user manual looks good, but the actual implementation is fucking schizophrenic. Every time I reinstall my project, pipenv breaks in a different way and I spend hours getting it working again. Often this involves stuff like poking around the pipenv codebase to find undocumented environment variables etc. Oh, and typically lots of breaking changes are introduced by a hacky workaround to an earlier breaking change. Also, I have never seen so many reverts in a project's release changelog lol but more like cry Pipenv really sucks. It wastes more time than it saves, and is frustrating in the worst way. /u/crabbone put it really well: &gt; Do you like spending time solving problems created by other people while creating software which they allege is intended to solve your problems of the kind your are already solving?
just here to ask, since i don't know java, does it not have operator overloading and const references? or is it just sticking with an earlier c++ standard?
Here's the python doc on `.update`: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.update. Calling `.update` modifies the dict in-place with key-value pairs from the method arguments. Here's what I think you want: elements_list = [] for name, element in elements.items(): value = element["value"] indicator = element["indicator"] elements.append(dict(element, name=name)) You seem to want to convert a nested map into a bunch of flat maps, by making the keys of the nested map the value of the "name" key in the new maps. 
Yep, sure is
This. I prefer flask since my projects never get too big and it's much simpler to get something going with basic functionality.

Just crack it in a minute with a debugger and you are fine. 😂 
Because you already passed it. Whatever is on the left of the dot operator is passed as the first argument.
idk, there is an "s" there so it is \`temps\`... that is pretty explicit, at least to me.

Over-priced and behind schedule 
I think I see your problem. (Apologies for the confusion/c++ lingo) In the first case, I think you are calling the member by referring to the class(type) name, this is giving you a function pointer to the method, so when you call it there is no objection left on the left of the door operator to be passed as the first argument. Ex: # first case Foo.bar(self, baz) # this is equivalent to (Foo.bar)(self, baz) # second case foo = Foo() foo.bar(self, baz) # this is equivalent to (Foo.bar)(foo, self, baz) If you are in the context of a method of Foo the second becomes (Foo.bar)(self, self, baz)
Object methods are not re-created per object, as are the object variables (attributes). `self` is needed exactly because of that: since methods (usually) operate on top of object attributes, they won't work unless you tell them which object they are supposed to act upon. Say you have, ``` class Increaser: def __init__(self, initial=0, step=1): self.value = initial self.step = step def increase(self): self.value += self.step a = Increaser() b = Increaser(10, 10) ``` You know `a` is an object, and you also know it is not the same object as `b`. But technically, `a.increase` and `b.increase` are the same method, in the same memory address. If you print those, Python will tell you it's the "`bound method Increaser.increase of &lt;blah.Increaser object at 0xSomeAddressMemory&gt;`." It being bound means it *already* knows what `self` is, what the object-to-act-upon is. Likewise, if you call just `Increaser.increase`, the *unbound* function, you **must** pass the object because the function won't know what `step` to add to `value` otherwise. Like /u/tletnes said, "Whatever is on the left of the dot operator is passed as the first argument" (if it's a bound method). In the end it doesn't matter if you write `Increaser.increase(a)` or `a.increase()`. They are the same thing.
what does it mean when I use two variable in the beginning of the for?
It’s mostly just a standard. It has to do with encapsulation of instance attributes. More modern JVM languages have ways to automatically create getters/setters for you but it’s still a common thing. Python doesn’t really have a true _private_ classifier so this type of encapsulation is hardly ever needed. 
Thanks all
Visual Studio Code mainly
Oh, hahaha, the world knows, and now you do, but nevermind that. You actually did write "installing locale". You must've edited the post later. But that's fine too. At least you made clear what you mean. That might have been a mistake--I don't really care. &gt; C.UTF-8 and will never even notice Well, that's bullshit, and I just explained why: the size. The impossibility of making a compatible font. I actually made about dozen of fonts. It was before TTF/OTF garbage became your only choice on every desktop sytem. So, yes, I actually do know a thing or two about it. The only "sort of fonts" that are available today that don't have to implement the entire Unicode table are the `*.pk` files distributed with LaTeX: because of how PDF is designed you can indeed have a font per "script" (this is so because PDF being a technology which predates the widespread use of Unicode has standardized font data-structures with dictionaries limited to 256 keys). What you choose to ignore is that I don't only complain about the user who's screwed up by idiotic libraries like `click`, but also the authors of fonts, who, if Unicode becomes standard will not be able to make standard fonts. In principle, whatever the implementation, it is simply not possible to implement the Unicode standard for a single human being. Something your overly humane self decided to disregard. (Of course, you can make defective fonts: i.e. just put a square or any other random symbol in place of glyphs you don't design). There could've been multiple other better solutions than Unicode. From technical perspective too. But it's worst bit is this "corporations only" side of font developing. I don't think they made it on purpose. More so, I don't think Unicode panel had any knowledge or experience of developing fonts / good knowledge of writing history of their writing system or other systems. But their idea played just way too well into the hands of MS, Adobe and Apple for them to pass on the opportunity. And now we have this shitty standard, and the whole of humanity has a contractual obligation to use it.
I'm on an i7 with an nvme and I can't even stand the initial load time.
Yeah, this is display code, and that part of the code specifically seems to be padded mostly for show I think to fill the screen? Also, the variables change, and setattr() would look pretty hacky there. unless there's a lot more to do, it's probably find to copy 8 lines of code.
Depending on the meaning and number of components, that might be over optimizations. My guess is that each one of those is one of the components of the rocket shown on the left. Unless they are identical, it may not be ideal to put them in a list, just to make this one function smoother.
That entire on_rio method with a bunch of redundant incremental set value bullshit is awful. That wouldn’t fly in my dev shop.
Brace yourself, day 3 is coming!
This looks like code for a 3D printer 
Yes it’s a list of dictionaries, how can I make it work?

Thanks, I didn't have time for all that. Well done!
&gt;Maybe it's only on the paid version, but PyCharm can definitely have multiple projects open concurrently and working sets. Thanks, I think I found a way to do that in PyCharm. Thanks! &gt;I don't know what you mean by preferring the IDE of Eclipse to the IDE of PyCharm...that's what they both are so that doesn't seem to make any sense. I was referring to Java. Both are IDE's indeed. But I wanted to point out that for Java I was still familiar and happy with Eclipse, but have moved to PyCharm as my IDE for Python, instead of PyDev (natural choice for a developer familiar with Eclipse) &gt;Also don't know what you mean about "when to build the project". You don't really "build" Python projects. That's a term from Eclipse. In IntelliJ/PyCharm/etc, the project is always being re-built in the background for you... i.e. PyCharm, in the case of Python, is running some code in the background to check what you type, type hinting, auto complete, spell check, etc... Sometimes it needs to re-index the whole project, but there other processes that you are not aware running in the background. Same goes for Eclipse, but you have the option to disable automatically build, and trigger that yourself. I am used to the latter way, where I modify parts of the code, some new files, delete, test something somewhere else, and then finally trigger a build within Eclipse. That concept, as far as I know, is not customizable in JetBrains products (though I could have missed, but asked an engineer from work who moved from Eclipse to IntelliJ, and she said it wasn't possible)
Brilliant. Successfully opened [multiple projects](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/opening-multiple-projects.html) in the same PyCharm. And using Scopes I can now see only the subset of the project/libraries I am working on. I have one more experiment for later... using both projects as egglink's in my local sys.path, then opening the code in PyCharm, I wonder if the IDE will open the file from the other already open project, or if it will show the file from my file system, without relating that source code to any project in my scopes. That's how I used to code/debug/troubleshoot in Java, with multiple projects open, inter-related, and opening files and jumping between projects, while debugging or just reading the code. But getting more and more comfortable with PyCharm. Thanks! 
Go spacemacs! It’s really hard for me when I see these editor battle threads and I walk my way through it like a checklist because spacemacs literally has it all. But then I’m afraid to comment because im afraid I’ll sound like a snob lol. but I honestly don’t know why everyone hasn’t switched already, besides the time it takes to learn vim keystrokes I guess. God I could never go back to a mouse tho it’s so sloooooww. I also use vim for quick edits when I’m trolling around config files on the CLI and whatnot but code writing is done exclusively in spacemacs. Glad to hear you’re enjoying it!
Hmm, this could use some linting
I worked with both of them and I’ll recommend to try both. 1. They both are popular, when you’ll start looking for job, it’ll better for you, if you’ll be able to work with any of them. 2. While you’re studying your main goal is learning - so trying both is great opportunity for self-learning. 3. After you write a project with each framework, you’ll be able to choose what you like more. ps I prefer Django. If I’ll want to start from scratch with microframework, I’ll choose aiohttp/tornado.
The thing that made me stuck with vim was how awesome it is.

Hey organizers, you're doing lots of things really well, but I want to suggest one little thing you could do better right now, about the moderation of questions: moderate better by moderating less. I've heard two people complain that their questions they considered reasonable were just deleted from the queue, and then the same thing happened to me. The moderation tool already allows the audience to downvote bad questions, and speakers can always just choose to skip some. Of course you should remove questions if they're completely off-topic or offensive or you're really really sure they got completely answered in the meantime. But if you just don't personally appreciate a question, just let the audience vote it up or down. ----- When it happened to me, the speaker (Ervin Varda) was talking about CYCLOMATIC COMPLEXITY, a term probably no more than 5 people in the room understood. It started as a side comment, but then there was [a section of his talk](https://youtu.be/D7XJHGuYEUE?t=14808) that suddenly became all about cyclomatic this and complexity that, and eventually he invited the audience to help him try to reduce the cyclomatic complexity of some piece of code on the screen. That would have been a great time for somebody to ask "can you just pause for a moment and tell us what that means" - if the moderator had allowed that question! I later looked it up on Wikipedia. Turns out it could have been answered in 15 seconds, and it would have instantly improved the understanding of the talk for 95% of us. It's even ironic, because that speaker had talked about concrete plans for "not losing the audience". Basically the moderator sabotaged the speaker's explicit goal. ----- Again, I've heard two other people complain about basically the same thing: they asked something on-topic and the question just disappeared before it could be voted on. I don't know the details of their questions, but their reaction suggested they were surprised by that outcome. I understand you almost certainly just made a mistake. But the mistake would have been avoided if you had been less zealous about removing questions that you're not sure about, so I'm asking you to change that now and for the future.
Vim requires a huge time investment, but it's also a huge payoff. If you're going to learn Vim, the earlier in life you do it, the better. Because over time, you just keep building and building, automating more and more things to the point where you hardly even type anything any more, you think of an idea and code just spits out.
Evil mode just doesn't cut it for me. As a transition tool, sure. But Emacs ecosystem wasn't designed to be Vim.
I really like Spyder because it gives me enough features to be fun to use, whilst being lightweight enough to stay snappy. Unfortunately, Anaconda pulled funding last year, and it looks like they're intending Jupyterlab to take over, which still has a way to go IMO.
The failure occurs on a line that tries to open a file, and says you don't have permission; that means there's at least one file or directory that you (meaning the user account running the script) don't have permission to open. The solution will be to manually go look at the file or directory mentioned in the error message, and see what the permissions are, then fix them to allow doing what you want. Also consider /r/learnpython for help with learning/writing Python, since it's designed for that.
I don't think you are meant for the real world. 
He's right though :/
This is what happens when you write code in the real world. Where time is of the essence, and people have lives and families in addition to their day job. No point in perfecting everything when what you have works perfectly fine, is simple enough for others to read, and most importantly, is delivered on time.
Who cares whether you use a for-loop for a fixed-size list of like 9. Trivial nitpicking. Plus, what if it isn't even loop-like, and those values get switched around. You didn't even consider that they may have a reason for doing it this way.
There is nothing wrong with the above code. I literally see nothing worth mentioning or making the person go back and re-do it. And most of the time, people have reasons for doing they things they do. Like oh noo, hard-coded numbers in what looks to be calculation-heavy code. You seriously think those numbers would be easier to read as variables? That's nonsense. And the "potential for-loop candidate" is just that, it could be a for-loop, but maybe it shouldn't be a for-loop, maybe it makes no logical sense for it to be a for-loop, what if those values get swapped-out regularly? 
You are multiplying a string with a boolean inside a formatted string for pluralization. This looks very hacky. 
I know it's a cli application but I still like having some kind of Screenshot in the readme.
OK, so. Let's consider a class: class Foo: def bar(self, arg): print(arg) Let's make an instance of it and call: f = Foo() f.bar('calling bar()') And let's compare to just a function: def bar(arg): print(arg) And we can call it: bar('calling bar()') It looks like Python's doing something special in the first case by magically passing the `self` argument to `Foo.bar`, where no implicit `self` is passed when we call the bare function. But is that true? Let's try this: import types types.FunctionType.__call__(bar, 'calling bar()') No really, type that in a Python interpreter and see what happens. This is because really there's no such thing as a bare function call in Python; every "bare" function is an instance of `FunctionType`, and calling such a function is calling the `__call__()` method of the instance. If you know enough about what you're doing and the structure of the base objects, you can create functions. For example: body = "print('Hello, world!')" global_names = {'print': print} code_obj = compile(source=body, filename='__main__', mode='eval') hello = types.FunctionType(code=code_obj, globals=global_names, name='hello') hello() Hello, world! Which also means the implicit passing of `self` isn't a special case: every function call in Python involves an implicit `self` argument, because every function call in Python *is* a method call.
Best of luck!
Well they are still updating Spyder separately. I’m running Spyder4 beta and it’s extremely stable along with having code folding &lt;3.
They have internet explorer on the taskbar lmao. 
Multiplying a string with a boolean is an idiom I use quite a bit and I don't consider it hacky at all.
That's JSON.
Euuuuh...... where is the video lmao
How about getting into reinforcement learning, and using OpenAI's Gym to teach your code to play games? 
I recommend Django because it contains all the batteries you need, the documentation is amazing, and the source code helped me learn how Python works. Django source code taught me more than any other resource.
Haha. Yeah I guess it was a bit disappointing but he's done some other pretty interesting mouse experiments. Pretty sure once he gets it working it will be interesting.
Beginner course!
&gt;Never use 'temp' for anything. If it's really temporary you probably don't need to assign it in the first place Actually, I don't think "temps" here indicates "temporary", but rather *temperatures*. You can see they have variables like conair_temperature. so this is definitely something this code is working with.
If I am reading your code right dog is a class it is not a list therefore it does not have a index, however list1 has 2 indexs, and each of those indexes has the attribute your looking for.
There’s no room for error when people’s lives are at risk. 
Hi friends interesting question. In my opinion as a python developer for many years, if you wanna build real world web application in python I prefer using Django , For some reason I use flask for small project . Best wishes.
It’s not like it’s being used for something important...like space travel

PyCharm for big projects (integration with web frameworks is really great), Emacs with [Elpy](https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy) for smaller or quicker jobs, and Notebooks for data analysis and teaching.
Replace subprocess call to `notify-send` with [notify2](https://pypi.org/project/notify2/). Define a **main** function that encapsulates the command line portion. Run the entire thing through `pylint` and fix all the whitespace warnings. Better yet run it through `yapf` or `black` first. Source a configuration file from the XDG_CONFIG_HOME -- or the standard default -- and use that while allowing env vars to override those values.

I simplified your code, because it's a mess. It will print a list of objects with `name` attribute "Doggy" (last line) formatted for easy reading (formatting done by `__repr__` method): ``` class Dog(): def __init__(self, age, name, sex): self.age = age self.name = name self.sex = sex def __repr__(self): return 'Dog "{}", {} years old, {}'.format(self.name, self.age, self.sex) list_of_dogs = [Dog(6, "Doggy", "Male"), Dog(7, "BorkMcBorkBork", "Male")] print([x for x in list_of_dogs if x.name == "Doggy"]) ```

Somehow this makes me think the creator of Sublime and WinRAR are good friends with each other and have long phone conversations.
You're an idiot for presuming to understand the requirements of the code just from looking at a small code snippet.
Latest update for VSCode significantly improves search: [https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1\_29#\_multiline-search](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_29#_multiline-search) &amp;#x200B; Not sure if this brings it to parity with Sublime or not, tho, as I'm not really a Sublime guy, but it's definitely a nice improvement.
/r/learnpython 
Thx 
Great blog. Had MS started embedding ML features/functions into excel (e.g. as shown in the blog) they would have millions of users and would be advancing the state-of-the-art in ML. But... Microsoft - it seems - needs to be left completely behind in a new area of technology (e.g. the internet, smart phones, etc, etc) before they finally get their shit together. 
I love VSCode. PyCharm would be my second choice.
Sublime Text + Terminal
Yeah, but I do web dev, and also use intellij for manuscripts and CLion for rust.
Learning commands for terminal is 50x more annoying than remembering in windows where each option is. Just an example. If you say something bad about a system, don’t forget there is also bad things on other systems. We just get used to them (which is why I said “for my personal taste”).
Agreed with you, my apologies. It’s common to see people atacking windows among the programming community so I jumped over the fence.
Sendgrid was recently purchased by Twilio but they have a really good email API. They have a template engine available to use
There really isn't. A 2000 line file is fine if it's not a mess. Just keep practicing! Knowing that you have a mess is a first good step. 
It's the best thing in the world. 
And you are a very rude person. Do you talk like that to people on the street? Some things about code do not fit specific requirements. And if you have to code on this level why do it in python even? I think it’s safe to assume this is a person that is used to old-school practices. I am not saying we should demonize people. But we should stay current with our times. Reading the cpp core guidelines on github for example, they include great advice for any language.
What's xray?
Creates a dictionary where each key is `node` and each value an empty `set`.
What? I have the exact opposite of a bone to pick with people. I'm the one *not* triggering about what I think is imperfect code. Please excuse me, for I didn't know it was unreasonable to think it's ridiculous to get triggered over a screenshot of code which isn't even all the bad.
I see thanks for the advice I’ll implement those things 
I think its hard to give any useful organizational advice without knowing what problem you are trying to solve, and the way you are going about solving it. &amp;#x200B; Here is some really generic advice: &amp;#x200B; 1. Write functions that have a single, clearly defined purpose. Don't write functions that try accomplish multiple things that are logically separate. That's "messy" and gets confusing down the line. Break big, multi-purpose functions into smaller, separate functions. 2. Write docstrings for all your functions! Codebases with bad documentation can seem messy when they really aren't because they are cumbersome and confusing to work with. 3. When your application becomes big enough that there are large pieces of it that are organizationally separate (here is all the database related code, here is all the GUI related code, etc), separate those areas of the code out into different files, make them proper modules, and import them where you need them. 4. Parameterize your functions/classes whenever possible to make them modular (i.e reusable). It's really "messy" to have multiple functions that do close to the same thing, but vary a little based on some piece of information. Make that piece of information a parameter for a single function. &amp;#x200B; Idk, hopefully that's helpful. Have fun!
Criticism and being angry are very different things. Does your response deal with the subject at hand or are you finger pointing? Why do you feel you have to start characterizing my personality when we are actually talking about code guidelines? 
Right after you did the *exact same thing*. You seriously think you are the only one allowed to have an opinion? Because oh boy, you're in for a treat once you leave your safe space, and into the real world.
Show your ram some mercy.
If you want a fully-featured vim, try https://spacevim.org/. But eventually you might find more value in maintaining a vimrc yourselves.
sharing the error message would be helpful
&gt;Or NTFS? What's wrong with NTFS? It's no worse than Ext4 or XFS. There's journaled, last-gen stuff like those 3, and current-gen checksummed filesystems like ZFS, BtrFS, ReFS and HAMMER2 that can self-heal bitrot. If you're using any of the last-gen non-checksummed filesystems and thinking that somehow ext4 is superior "because lolz ntfs fragmentations ext4 doesn't" is just malarkey, as I've seen plenty of fragmented to hell ext3/4 systems. I've never had a "forced" reboot. I've had some where it *would* have forced it, had I ignored it for days on end. Rebooting for anything other than kernel updates is pretty BS, but still. &amp;#x200B; The ads? I've just run the de-bloat powershell script for that and it's all gone. &amp;#x200B; Now the good: Windows Subsystem for Linux. I get Windows with all the goodies it has (better font rendering, better color rendering, vastly superior hardware support, beyond vastly better software options, etc etc), along with 99% of what's best about Linux. It's got some performance issues compared to running the same stuff on Linux natively, but it's not bad and it's getting better. Sure beats dual-booting, and sure as hell beats stupid shit like "why doesn't firefox scroll the webpage when I use my touchscreen?" or "why the hell does this font look like a burning pile of dogshit?" and it's a million times better than WINE. &amp;#x200B; I'll code on whatever requires the least amount of fuckery to get working and keep working, as I don't get paid to figure out why the hell Nautilus suddenly quit accepting my mouse-back button to go back or how to get my sound to auto-switch to my headphones when I plug them in or how to keep my sound from defaulting to HDMI out when I'm actually using optical out or any other number of bullshit things that Linux fucks up that Windows "just works" with. &amp;#x200B; Is it annoying that I have to constantly delete motherfucking candy crush from my purchased-in-a-store copy of Windows 10 Pro (not some bundled-with-a-PC home crap)? Yes it is. Is that more annoying that plethora of garbage issues Linux runs into? Nope, not at all.

hint: use numpy.arange and numpy.outer also: /r/learnpython
Neat, but no. This package highlights the reason I recommend against using semantic versioning blindly. What's the point of releasing a new version every 1-6 days for months on end and that's without a change log? That's not a stable API, which doesn't that violate the whole idea of semantic versioning? Slow it down. I will not use a package that releases that frequently and will upgrading my dependencies once every 6 months or so.
The issue turned out to be much simpler: the webhooks communicated with my site through HTTP, but lost their way when they were redirected to HTTPS. Thanks for your detailed reply, though!

Thank you so much. I was just researching to make sure that I have everything installed. 
Nice, looking forward to your next video.
Ah that's good stuff. As its my first really large program I'm probably breaking all those rules, but I'm learning.
Sandi Metz is mostly Ruby but has lots of thoughts that apply to all programming languages. 
You cannot import from an upper directory apart from within packages. You can only do that by manipulating the import path. Pytest does this for you, thats why you can just write "import src".
Corporate and government operations the world over use windows, the office suite, outlook, and skype. They're the default business software provider due to inertia from training millions of office workers in their use, even if they're usually a few years behind the competition
I'm building my first API for work so we can better manage networking data for our stores. Before I came in, we used a spreadsheet that has been passed through so many teams that none of the data could be trusted anymore, so I took the spreadsheet, made a SQLite database, built a front end to reference the data, and now building an API that allows the front end and database to interact while leaving the API available for future projects for monitoring and such. :) First time ever using Python, so I'm lurking here for tips. ;)
&gt; or a new terminal does not make difference IMO. The whole point of a terminal in editor is that it understands programs output and you can jump to error lines for example. Tmux can't do it AFAIK.
Whatever you say, you're not passing any good code review
This is what I'm working on right now. Should be ready to publish soon. 
Underrated comment right here. Had a client one who made their own staff video manuals for the software I was working on. Their cost of every small change was ridiculous.
That should be really helpful for people working with matplotlib. I am inspired by other people's code all the time, it is always interesting when someone is inspired by mine.

Thanks for making this, saved me a headache trying to quickly throw together a few animations for a presentation - took less than a minute to recreate an animation that took ~ 45mins of wrestling with matplotlib directly, will be using this in the future.

I second this, and will add: design your program to be unit-tested. This will force you to follow most of the above advice, since if you don't, it'll be too hard to test.

To say that something is not wrong because it is popular is an extremely dangerous thing. I do not need to call on history for us to understand how many things we look back upon now were once greatly popular, and in demand. To phrase this in a way that is more relevant to corporations: market value does equal positive impact. 
Thanks! I stumbled across your code a while ago (I forget how) and basically wrote this code. I figured others might find it useful so I packaged it up :)
&gt; I said I was, but was having trouble recreating the results. I've never had a problem running the exact code listed on the matplotlib examples. You specifically said you had trouble with the time series data. Are you sure you're using that right? Gotta start with the basics. &gt; Have you ever worked with Matplotlib? I've been coding python for 13 years. I mean, I linked you to an example of a heatmap. Yes.

Yes! 
My issue was that I needed something 'like' more than one example. They were seemingly identical except for which function they used. Copy and pasting the example code works, yes, but only to do exactly what was in the example. I'm not trying to throw shade, considering you have been at this far longer than myself. My question was only what resources you use. If you exclusively use the official doc's then that is all you had to say.
Again, you're in the wrong place for questions and yes, I use the official docs almost exclusively. That's why I linked to it.

&gt;[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html) strives to provide local data storage for individual applications and devices. SQLite emphasizes economy, efficiency, reliability, independence, and simplicity. **SQLite** would be a good choice for such application since it will be a local app. Also, using SQL is easier than using CSV file, since filtering data will be as simple as writing one line SQL statement, which is not the case with CSV file as you will do the hard work yourself. Python provide a preinstalled sqlite3 module, which is easy to understand and to use. See the module's [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) for more details. &amp;#x200B;

You were able to import tensorflow so did you have to define that virtual environment as 64bit beforehand?
No
what if setValue is threadsafe or something like that?

I believe it will just give you an error or not load if you try to do so
That's crazy. We already have a hard time keeping all out documentation up to date, I couldn't imagine the effort involved in doing video guides...

&gt;The reader that matters will always have some domain knowledge. &amp;#x200B; What if the reader is just updating the GUI and doesn't know anything about temperature sensors? &amp;#x200B; And why wouldn't they have a new hire work on some non-mission critical code that has a GUI to display temperature sensors? &amp;#x200B; It's pretty unlikely that NASA rockets have python QT GUI code reading from Rio sensors ...

A little confused I am. The link on [www.wikipython.com](https://www.wikipython.com) works perfectly. wikipython is a hobbyist site and is not "secure", (though in 3 years not a hint of a problem) but that is why downloads are all from GitHub - which is secure. the GitHub download link is: [https://github.com/GitHubJohn2/TB1-Python-General-Toolbox/blob/master/TB1%20Pro700%204pg%20600dpi%20for%20GitHub%20111818.pdf](https://github.com/GitHubJohn2/TB1-Python-General-Toolbox/blob/master/TB1%20Pro700%204pg%20600dpi%20for%20GitHub%20111818.pdf)

Yeah, my script runs fine. I don't understand what you mean by system fold paths.
I like videos for learning concepts because I'm a visual person and I need drawings most times. And for those it's usually fine because concepts don't change often if at all. Examples would be network protocols or how different kinds of DBs work.
Import statements are from the root directory of the project in Python, regardless of where the file actually is in Python. In your case, that is the project_name folder, which is why your import works
Yes, you can type `code repo-name` which works the same way.
Sorry system file paths.
Sorry if I seem a bit dull, but how would I check that?
I could tell you what it is but Wikipedia probably does that better. Instead I'll tell you what it gives you in this scenario: a reproducible environment that you describe with code.
Another way to phrase it: the programmer doesn't know about `collections.defaultdict`.
How about you pay yourself industry rates in order to drop out from school.
Don't get me wrong, but I've been googling it for past 4 days and I got lost :D
It might just work. Or you might have another lib in your library path that gives you hell. Or the other way round. You don't really want to find out. Virtualenvs are there to save programmer time and hairs.
thanks! ;3
If you are hardcoding any file paths then switch to using pathlib. Also make sure you close any file you open with python. Remember it will remain open even if you have a syntax error so it’s best practice to use the With open Method of opening files. 
It's just a containerized environment for modules or packages, there's some out there for python and all of its deep learning tools, but you can also make your own.

Hey, I'm sorry to bother you. firstly, I have almost 0 knowledge of python and I'm currently taking a course on it. Secondly, this isn't my homework; I'm looking for this purely out of interest. And finally, if you have any suggestions on which kind of query to Google, your help would be greatly appreciated! Have a good evening, Max

How common are programming classes in high school? I graduated in 2012 and we didn't have any. I did go to a public school, however. 
I did a search for graphics.py and found this http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics/graphics/index.html
ETL tool for MSSQL. It was too slow for my liking so I used R.
Text write up would be great but don’t do a docker file. My favorite thing about this video is the step by step install. There are already plenty of pre configured docker files available already. 
It's an experimental "next-gen" atom from the same developers, rebuilt for speed, along other things. It's technically still electron based, but a bunch of the internals are being rebuilt in rust with a thin-as-possible frontend layer. https://github.com/atom/xray
I think I see, you mean in my program. I'm just getting into python so it's a very simple program that generates math questions, there's no file paths in the program. I tried it all with idle closed and in admin mode.
It depends. Google has a decent API that splits addresses into pieces. I've had significant difficulty with user-input addresses because of completely random input, and dealing with international addresses

I think AP CS is spreading in places that support the AP programs. My high school offers it now, but didn't when I graduated in 2009. For what it's worth, there are a couple of high schools in my area (Seattle) that offer CS classes taught by people from the University CS department, but it's Seattle, so probably not very generalizable.
Is there some other option other than the obvious one? All I can think of is "diksh" (based on the first sound of "dictionary", but that's....very wrong.
/ditk/ and sometimes people who hear it slightly out of context giggle and hear it as /dik/ or /dikd/.
if it makes you uncomfortable why not call it a dictionary?
The de facto national programming language is Java because of the APCS course.
I pushed for a programming class in my high school, and it went into effect my senior year (2017), although we went with JavaScript instead of Python. For reference, this is in a very small Midwestern school.
This is silly and not a good thing. Do not "standardize" on one particular language.

Right now in my high school AP Comp Sci is a very popular AP. Our School also provided Computer Programming I and II which teaches Python 
There are absolutely reasons to use the above pattern instead of a defaultdict. For example, if you wanted to iterate through it later and didn't know whether every value set would have had elements added to it.
Dictionary. 
Welp, tellin it like it is.
Dang. Why didn’t they pick VB.
Say "map" instead. I ptefer to call it a map brcause several other lanugages call it a map, not dict. 
I think python should be the universal standard for open source projects as well as the programming language of every nation.
Didn't read all of it but the only mention of python I found was about teaching complex types as python named types such as "tuples". Nothing more, I also read that, some part of the teaching will be dedicated to development such as websites and I highly doubt they'll teach the kids anything except HTML/PHP (unfortunately especially not Flask/Django). But of course I would love they set Python as studied programming language. Anyway they'll get it all wrong anyway because french educational system is fucked up, and you can trust me, I've seen shit in more than 20 years being a pupil then a student.
"Make Python great again", right ? Well you should hate french government and maybe the "parisiens", but the other french, we are mostly friendly. :)
"Meet my sister......fourth best prostitute in all of Kazakhstan." ;) Had to.
Yeah I was speaking about that. You can install it but to get it running as expected you have to do some pretty crazy configuration shit that isn’t documented anywhere by Redhat so far as I can tell and only exists on some very specific blogs or Stackoverflow threads. 
import os s = "Hey, this isn't my homework. I'm just trying to get free shit." f=open('log.txt', 'w+') for i in \[i for i in range(len(s))\] + \[i for i in range(len(s), 0, -1)\]: print(s\[:i\],file=f) f.close() os.startfile('log.txt')
Because that version of 3.6 isn't out in your distributions package manager

I mean agreed but you have to build a curriculum around something.
Alright in that case if you want to try to install pyinstaller again try python -m pip install pyinstaller Seems like your permissions at the temp levels folders are not the same as your control permissions for whatever reason. This also brings up another option. Using virtualenv to create an environment then installing modules in that environment to keep it separate. python -m pip install virtualenv Go to the directory you want to place that environment..still in cmd... Virtualenv nameofenvironment Still in cmd... Travel to the new environment directory&gt;Scripts&gt;activate.bat This is generally best practice because it allows you to only use the modules you need for each environment. This way when you use pyinstaller in the environment it will generate the exe using only the modules you need.
Looks to me that `tc1`-`tc8` are variable auto-generated by Qt when loading in a UI markup file of some kind. Doesn't look like the programmer's fault.
Graduated in '07, only courses available were online through VHS. I took two- both were utter garbage and mostly consisted of copying someone else's code into a new document and then submitting it. I think programming education needs to start pretty early, age 10-12 or so. That's the sweet spot where you're young enough to have the enthusiasm to tackle new things and just get lost in them, but not too young that you aren't capable of understanding the basic ideas, following instructions, and etc.

The discipline that is supposed to answer your question is called "software architecture" (as opposed to "computer science"). However, the relation is similar to philosophy and math. On one hand you have something that is easy to prove correct, but means too little to be useful, on the other hand--a whishy-washy attempt at finding meaning and usefulness.

I'll first answer the question asked in SO, and then the one you ask. &gt; Why he called it BurpExtender itself when he could have called it self? Because calling `self.fuzz_url(...)` doesn't mean the same thing. If this class is ever extended (inherited from), then `fuzz_url` may be overloaded, in which case this code will be calling to an entirely different method. If the author did it intentionally, it was done to prevent accidental overriding in subclasses. &gt; But why it counts as it as an extra parameter? This is how `.` (dot) operator works, when applied to object and method. The algorithm is roughly as follows: Given `foo.bar(baz)` 1. Look up `"bar"` in the list of properties of and `foo` (could be `__dict__` or `__slots__`), if found save it to `f`. 2. If not found, look up `"bar"` in the list of properties of `type(foo)`, if found save it to `f`. 3. If not found, raise an error. 4. call `f(foo, baz)`.
Hmmmm, interesting. So I have pip 18.1. How do I get that version of python?

[Joel Spolsky once recounted having Bill Gates review the design](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/06/16/my-first-billg-review/) of a feature he was managing for Excel in the 1990s. This is the key line: &gt;Bill doesn’t really want to review your spec, he just wants to make sure you’ve got it under control. His standard M.O. is to ask harder and harder questions until you admit that you don’t know, and then he can yell at you for being unprepared. You don't have to use young and evil Bill Gates' MO, but I think he had the right idea. When you do a code review, the real question is: does this person have the problem under control? That's the difference between a good code review that only a human can do, and some anti-patterns that pylint can tell you about.
So how does it work? Are all anaconda's python virtual machines 64bit by default?

I like Flask way more than I like Django, but they have different aims. You can get a Flask app running in like 4 lines, while with Django you get a folder full of stuff even for the simplest stuff. The upside of course is that it has most of all you will need straight off the bat. You might like that, or you might prefer to build something as simple/complex as needed for the project. I use Flask on the backend and Vue.js on the frontend, to also get the benefits of modern js frameworks.
Isn't there a way to "obliterate" an instance using its memory address?
OP meant distribution package manager as in : “apt-get”. Pip can be used to manage Python packages, but Python is an OS package/dependency managed by apt-get. Different beast.
Why did you have to?
Java and Python are widely used programming languages all over the world. The software development is done in a very robust and concrete way with these languages. But, there are some key [**differences between Java and Python**](https://technographx.com/5-key-differences-between-java-and-python/) which are mentioned here. Let us have a look at them. 1.Type of Language Python and Java are both high-level programming languages. Python is basically an interpreted programming language. If you want to execute the Python code directly, you have to use the operating system specific Python interpreter. On the other side, Java is a compiled programming language. The code written in Java is compiled into the bytecode that runs on any platform having the Java Virtual Machine. The code can be transferred from one platform to another very easily. 2.Programming Paradigm Support A number of programming paradigms are supported by both the programming languages. Python supports functional, procedural programming paradigm, imperative and object-oriented concept. Java was developed initially as an object-oriented and class-based programming language but it has evolved with time. 3.Code Readability Python puts a strong emphasis on code readability. It enables to keep the code clean, concise and readable. Developers prefer Python over other programming languages for avoiding writing additional code and to keep the applications maintainable. Java comes with a new set of features with each of its new version for simplifying the software development process. In the case of Java, the developers have to put extra effort and time for maintaining the code and keeping it organized. 4.Standard Library Python has a large comprehensive standard library. The libraries make it easy for programmers to write a variety of different software applications. There are over 130000 different Python packages that include a database, graphical user interface, web frameworks, multimedia, image processing, scientific computing and much more. Java also allows developers to select from a wide range of different libraries. The developers are also able to choose from the core, user interface, and integration libraries. But still, Python scores more than Java in the standard library category. 5.Speed and Performance Both Python and Java lack the speed required for facilitating high-performance computing. But, the Java code execution speeds up by JVM through JIT compiler. The bytecode is compiled to native machine code quickly by JIT compiler. Also, concurrency in Java makes the software applications run faster. On the other side, Python code can be executed in a fast way through different implementations of the language.
i need some assistance ,i am working on project on sentimental analysis ,in which i want to identify the word through there abbreviations which makes it easy for chat bot to communicate with the user and have more liberty to interact with customers
Use of `except:` or `except Exception`. Use of `global`. Use of `eval`. Presence of `print` or `input` in almost _anything_ that isn't trivial. Files handled without using `with open`. Use of **dromedaryCase**... this one is mildly facetious. Use of _Hungarian Notation_ ... this one isn't.

why is the APP (trello) exporting this json, putting the Array[1]?
Not reliably. You might be able to do it with **ctypes**, but I'd tend to question the value and wisdom in doing so for anything but malicious purposes.
It's the de facto standard in the UK now as well.
python is the best
Yes mandatory. 
That's a fine choice though. For one, it's the easiest language to play with. Everyone has a browser and you can just open the dev console and start writing code. It's everywhere. Web development is huge, and it's the language of the browser. Being good at JS alone is enough to get a job. Node makes it so you can do the backend too. JS alone can lead to full stack web dev. And there's support everywhere, resources, libraries, everything. It's absolutely everywhere. It might have some real oddities, like addition not being commutative... &gt; [] + {} "[object Object]" &gt; {} + [] 0 ... but clean JS done right can look good and be very easy to work with. Some things are nasty, sure, but JS *can* be very elegant. I'd say JS is a smart choice, as Python would be. 
If you're scraping from Trello it could be an internal format, if you're using an official API, I'd look at the documentation/submit a big report
There's ways to use `global` and `eval` safely, and some typically fairly specialized edge cases for doing so, but _usually_ they're a code smell. Be curious to see an example of that lazy-load approach, though.
As /u/sabogo says below, you have to standardize on something to build a curriculum around it. The authors of the report do anticipate your concerns: &gt; A programming language is necessary to write programs: an easy-to-use, interpreted, concise, Free, free, multiplatform, widely-used with a large community of programmers in the education community is to be preferred. At the time of the creation of this program, the selected language is Python version 3 (or above). _Expertise in a specific programming language is not, however, an objective of this curriculum._ [emphasis mine] Moreover, Python is already the language of choice for the _concours commun_, the entrance exams for many of France's elite engineering schools. That doesn't mean that students exclusively learn Python. In the engineering schools, students will typically build on that foundation to use, e.g., Java, Matlab, C++, etc., as they need to specialize in different areas. But they have a certain degree of computational literacy under their belts. &gt; Un langage de programmation est nécessaire pour l’écriture des programmes : un langage simple d’usage, interprété, concis, libre et gratuit, multiplateforme, largement répandu, riche de bibliothèques adaptées et bénéficiant d’une vaste communauté d’auteurs dans le monde éducatif est à privilégier. Au moment de la conception de ce programme, le langage choisi est Python version 3 (ou supérieure). L’expertise dans tel ou tel langage de programmation n’est cependant pas un objectif de formation.
That doesn't mean that they'll never touch any other programming language. It's more like if there's situations where they need to teach data types, inheritance, aspects of functional programming, general computer science stuff like algorithms, then they'll use Python. It's okay to have a standard language for learning generic concepts. And not just that, but it's also about being able to have standards for testing knowledge of these concepts. If there were a standardized test, you need to be able to write questions targeting a standardized curriculum. It's way easier if they're guaranteed to have been taught certain material by a certain grade. This way if tests show blocks of python code, they know that everyone should be able to work with it. 
I'll see if I can dig up the source of the lazy load approach and if not I'll put together a code snippet that demonstrates it. But yeah I completely agree, usually you're just in for headaches if you use them.
Delphi surely! 
Pizza is a dangerous thing for you health...
You can do similar things in Python, sometimes. You can assign into a pattern by doing this: head, *tail = things In the above example, you'd get the first value from your list of things in head, and all the other items in tail. a, *middle, b = things In the above, you get the first item in a, the last item in b, and the rest in middle. https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3132/
&gt; This is silly and not a good thing. &gt; &gt; Do not "standardize" on one particular language. I don't think you understand France.
This task is oddly specific for not being a homework. Secondly, if you need code to... I don't know, learn Python I guess, you could google out anything you'd like. There's a ton of public Python code out there, short and long, with comments. You could even start with googling "python tutorial" and results would be much, much more useful than some code doing one, very specific thing.
Because they're not retarded.
It's been a bit unstable last i tried ( last 6 mon ago)
For fbs, what were the reasons for choosing NSIS over WiX? I converted the installer for our Python software at work, and WiX has given us a lot less trouble then our original NSIS version.
&gt; conversely, over-engineering simple solutions for the sake of propriety or academic correctness But... what if I want to reuse my code somewhere else? Writing a function properly so it's a simple function call away should not be a red flag, unless it's not in a reusable code block.
This array[1] seems to be added by my JSON viewer plugin.
It actually isn't that hard if you have a passion for coding.

Feel good, Kazakhstan Much attention is pay to teaching children digital skills.This also help increase the level of computer literacy in Kazakhstan.

I just remembered another Python library that maybe has a somewhat similar scope - http://zulko.github.io/blog/2014/09/20/vector-animations-with-python/
Cool projects, maybe some better editing skills are needed.
They're choosing among governance systems first in ranked ballot voting. After they pick a system they will elect any people required by the governance system. The systems they are choosing among are PEPs 8010 through 8016. For example 8010 would then mean that they elect a new BFDL, 8011 would mean there are 3 co-BFDLs, 8012 would have the Python core developers voting on anything controversial unless there was a clear consensus.

Python: the language stupid enough for your average school student.
It's called MATHEMATICS, the basic subject that all programmers born before 2000 took and yet still became proficient developers. Learning a programming language through a curriculum is utterly stupid, but I guess society wants more vaginas in front of keyboards, so forcing the ladies into it at school is the only way...
Fuck you and your whitespace-dependent language.
thanks for response ;3 
Thanks you for the thorough response. I had also read a blog post discussing the specifics of plots, figures, axes etc and how they are handled. The same blog post indicated that many people have similar frustrations with Matplotlib docs. Certainly didn't mean to sound like I was badmouthing Matplotlib. For me, the Matlab functionality in open source package is invaluable. And the chances of my problems being a result of my own ignorance are nearly 100% Maybe my initial post was not clear enough- OpenCV has pyimagesearch, learn OpenCV and several other blogs to walk novices through some of the nuance. Anything similar for Matplotlib? 
You have not get laid lately, do You?
It is the same as to force everyone to learn math
It’s stupid easy. I don’t know your setup, but it’s as simple as installing rh-php72 and the HTTP RPM that provides the module for Apache. Then simply load the module like you would PHP5 from days of old. The PHP module ends up in /opt/rh/rh-php72/root/ somewhere. 
Yes, but there is basically no job where you don't need any basic math. I'm also not a fan to force ppl. to learn advanced math, some ppl. are just not good at it and will never use it. They would do better learning something they actually like. I still don't see why i had 9 years of music in school for no reason. If i want to get into music, i will teach it myself when i am motivated to do so and will learn in 2 weeks what i didn't learn in 9 years because i wasn't motivated.
Superior potassium 
Schools are not teaching exact knowledge they are giving skill to think and find the answer of problem. Maybe not all of them will use programming in their jobs but they will think differently.
Do we have any idea who will take place instead of Guido as BDFL ?
In theorie, yes. But thats not what my experience shows. I still hate or have a really negative attitude against everything i was forced to learn in school that i didn't like back then. And i can see how 80% of school kids will absolutly hate programming because that's just not something for everyone. It's the same with math. Out of 18 kids in or class we where two wo loved math and everyone else just hated it and does to this day.
Does '$python -m pip' work? 
 I think it's depends on teacher and every Ministry trying to do there program according to perfect teacher skills. 
Clearly, they should all be learning Perl. 
It’s in the benchmarks and Cerberus is slow as hell. Wanted to use it for a prod app but it was so unbearably slow for large JSON schema that I had to move away from it.
&gt; he was graduated in USA yea, that will surely help the kids become Python programmers make it possible for their parents to get them unlimited 100 Mbps at home for $10 per month, and do not have to pay giant prices for hardware that gets imported into the country by a monopoly controlled by "President's" family, that'll help more this is how Scandinavian countries became internet and programming literate in 90s - 00s, not because their minister of education "graduated in USA"

I would also appreciate, if you open an issue for any feature you miss.
A bit confused about the last one, isn't that the convention for class names?
A link to a post containing audio about trying to extract information from text.
you know better 
No. Hungarian Notation is when you incorporate the _type_ of a thing in the _name_ of a thing, ie: **thing_list** or **map_dict**. If you meant the second last, then still no, the convention for class names is **CamelCase** not what I persist in calling **dromedaryCase**, which I am quite certain is one of the greatest evils ever committed by humanity upon itself (and the Bactrian).

Honestly I really think this is nonsense. For one programming alone, especially the way it is often taught in high schools, isn't extremely useful to most students. What we really need is education that focuses on the technology behind computers and programming languages are just a part of that. I like to compare this to the way things where done decades ago when I was in school. One of the classes that exposed student to different technologies was aptly call "shop" class. A class where you learned a little bit of the different industrial technologies. These days computing, the related electronics and allied industries are an industrial technology all of their own. It would student a lot of good to see a little bit of everything related to the technology to spur interests. FIRST competitions are actually close to an ideal here as students get exposure to many facets of industry be it programming, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering and things I'm forgetting. Some schools have also created Makers Spaces which is for all intents modern shop classes. My point is high school should be about giving students exposure to the reality of the work world so that they can develop interests to pursue in post high school education. Standardizing on any one language just distorts reality.
None that I can think of, but you’d be able to get away with docs+google for almost any kind of task
Having taught A MOOC where we made this mistake I trial and completely agree with you. The fights we had over these kind of how to videos were intense too. I was on your side but my boss was not. Ultimately data won the day when the videos were shown not to be effective compared to documentation.
Look into stuff like bountysource, you get to help an open source project while getting paid to implement specific features.
Well things haven't changed much. I graduated in 1978 from high school. For the most part computers did not exist in the school. One of the science teachers managed to get the school to buy a HP calculator / computer, it was a strange device but he wouldn't let anybody touch it. In any event I'm a strong believer that we can be too focused on "programming" in high school doing students a huge disfavor. What students need is a broader exposure to the tech world with a bit of computer science included. By the way I know this might shock many here, but mechanical engineering, engineering, geology, and etc are all part of the world of tech. WE need to do more for students to expose them to real career choices so they are better prepared for the path they will follow after leaving high school.
Maybe he does and that is why he said "Do Not "standardize" on one particular language".
I guess I'm just generally confused on how they work. I can't grasp them at all.
There may not be a BDFL depending on the governance model. I'd be shocked if they picked the BDFL model. There is no clear #2 among the core devs and the reason we're in this situation is most of the core devs disagreed with Guido on assignment expressions - they're in this situation because they broke the BDFL.
Well no not really. It is a huge disservice to students to leave them with the impression that Python is the language of choice everywhere. Beyond that high level languages are not ideal for a balanced education. I'm still of the opinion that having high school students spend a year learning to program is wasteful and not in the students best interest. You would be far better off exposing students to a variety of professional jobs. In the end many high school students have no idea what many of the trades or professions involve and how careers in those occupations feel.

I once reviewed code which had no blank lines, no comments, no logging. Some of the simple checks I do are looking for comments, logging, exception handling, and that general coding best practices are being followed (such as variable names making sense, files handled correctly, code is readable and not made to be as few lines as possible). I also look at it from this approach: If there was a bug in production and this person is no longer with the company, would there be enough info to debug from logs and enough comments for someone to understand that section without having to go through all the code.
Could you extend on this?
Oh! Didn't know that was called Hungarian notation. I haven't seen lots of *thing_lists*, but I frequently encounter *lst* (this one always bums me out for some reason) or *l* lists and *s* strings (these two I have no problem seeing in short scripts, but I can see them becoming more than annoyances in projects of any size). dromedaryCase is a cool name I hadn't seen yet which contrasts nicely with CamelCase. I like that name more than mixedCase.

I absolutely hated linear algebra in school because I just didn't understand it and why I needed it. Now, several years later, I have to use machine learning at my job and also started programming video games as my hobby, and guess what I need for this: Vectors and matrices. So I learned that stuff within months because YouTube is such a better teacher than most teachers I had in school. &amp;#x200B; If my maths teacher would have told me that I need all this for video games... 
That's some wonky code under [error handling](https://validx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#error-handling) from validx import exc try: search_params({"limit": 200}) except exc.ValidationError as e: error = e error.sort() print(error) would do it like this: from validx import exc try: search_params({"limit": 200}) except exc.ValidationError as error: error.sort() print(error) 
and you can also do `apt-cache show python3.6
too much indentation
My high school didn’t have a programming class so I started a club for it in my junior year. Before then, the best you could do for programming was learning LabVIEW for robotics.
Must be British
Poor security choices in code (blatant disregard for OWASP, etc) should be handled as code quality issues, don't differentiate between sloppy, slow, or insecure code - it's all low quality code. 
I agree with that to some degree, but there was probably no teacher in the world that could have motivated you to learn linear algebra. You where just not interested in it at that point. Also if you have 30 Students every one would have a complelty different way you had to motivate him with. There is not "a way" you can teach and it will magically make everyone interested.
Interestingly enough, you see Hungarian Notation a fair bit in Django. I've never thought to work out why it's accepted.
I mean just because it’s a Python course doesn’t mean they couldn’t discuss all of the different languages and where Python fits in on the first day of class. It can also help to standardize so that students can collaborate easier. I also believe programming teaches a new way of thinking that a lot aren’t exposed to, which can’t really hurt. Agreed on the trade/professional skills though.
The values are always 1 and 2 until the requirements of the project change. By that time your project is already in production. Changing these two values forces you to take the system offline, edit the source code, and redeploy everything again. Then you look back and think you would've avoided all that trouble had you not explicitly defined them and, instead just used a config file to initialize all the values every runtime.
Joel on software, yeah, so hard to remember
I said exactly about my country, because in Russia students in schools learn only pascal, then in other countries they studying python. It makes me angry.
It varies a lot, at least in NJ. My high school taught Visual Basic .NET -&gt; C++ back in 2007, with Java supposedly offered as a final course (it was canceled by the time I signed up for it though). Conversely, many of my coworkers from NJ report that they had no programming classes offered at all. The most they had were engineering classes (AutoCAD) or robotics clubs offered after hours.
Cute, but that actually means "Frankic", not "French". 
&gt;This task is oddly specific for not being a homework. Not unfathomable that someone should want a copypasta generator for YouTube.
Generalize the third time you have to implement the same thing is the rule I go by
WTF. I graduated in 1991 and we had one. It was the first year and there were only four of us in the class, but two decades later and you didn't have *any*?! My kids definitely have programming classes offered in their public school.
Django should be great for this. The ORM is awesome and you get a minimal CRUD app (admin panel) for free!
It's written in this way, because \`error\` variable is used in the next example sections, which are outside \`except\` scope. And since all examples are actually executed and tested using Sphinx doctest extension, these tests crush without such silly assignment \`error = e\`.
I had programming in my public school in 1978. BASIC on an HP 3000 and then FORTRAN (seems like all the programming languages back then we're shouting). Granted this was in Palo Alto, California. But still, I'm having my 40th high school reunion next year.
Code style is a big red flag, if your code is messy you aren't keeping track of the overall product. 
Ah ah ah. En python, s'il vous plaît.
In my Algorithms class the prof will often write some pseudo code on the blackboard to make a point, then say "this should compile in python btw.". Out of all the popular programming languages, python does seem to be by far the easiest to get into and understand.
Great Progress!!! &amp;#x200B;
This is absolutely not bad practice... I don't know what you're thinking. You say "hard coded" like it's a bad thing. And your further comments go on to leave no room for any corner cases. ``` class Square(): sides = 4 ``` vs ``` class Square(): def __init__(num_sides): self.sides = num_sides ``` One of these is proper, the other allows for setting a value in a nonstandard way that breaks all assumptions. There's absolutely a reason to use class-defined variables. It's a feature of the language... 
Every french person I've met speaks pretty solid English, even in rural areas
&gt; libre et gratuit means "open-source and free" rather than Free and free 
- Commented out code - Magic numbers - Classes/functions that might not need to exist - Nonspecific exception handling - Heavy nesting - Wrong tool for the job- failure to use a better data structure, or a contextmanager, etc. - PEP8
I dont get it
The way you talk, you're obviously not a professional. All theory but no real experience to back it up. Room for any corner case? There's no room for compromise when you're working on operations.
Fuck in my school they still teach java 
Don't even bother replying. I've lost interest.
r/learnpython
Why not just encourage people to learn what they want? Pythons great, but not for everything. Some people are motivated by app developement. That means things like java are better.
You're not discussing code written in "several other languages", you're using Python and the name of the type is `dict`. `map` is a completely different thing. Why do so many Python coders have an inferiority complex about the language and its terminology? I bet that people using those other languages don't say "I always call maps "dict" because that's what Python calls them", except perhaps apologetically as their own flaw.
* Use of except: or except Exception:. * Use of global. Reliance on side effects. * Use of eval. Even if you think it's a neat corner case, it's not. Use a library that explicitly handles your corner case and does it with consideration for all the security implications you are not thinking about. * Long functions/methods. * No tests written * No docstrings * Use of Print instead of Logging and Log Levels * Any unbounded lists (E.g. read a file into a list, read a query into a list, etc.) * Manual closing of files instead of using a context manager * Any Python2-only compliant code (e.g. `print "hi"`, or using %s instead of .format) * Reusing common names like File * Any `import *` * Mixed whitespace (2-space, 4-space, tab) * Lack of a requirements.txt for imports added * Use of threading with insane thread pool counts (I've seen people start 20,000 threads claiming it makes things faster). * Multiprocessing without respect for the number of available processors (`multiprocessing.cpu_count()`). 
OP...enlighten us!
Fine, let's call them associative arrays instead.
I have extensive experience writing performant Python, code reviewing peers, and deploying production code in the wild. I've worked on systems used by millions and load tested to hundreds of thousands of concurrent users. I have an extensive background in DevOps and performance testing Python code for large-scale production launches. However, I have no reason to justify myself to someone so defensive and insulting. You replied within 1 minute with a childish "Don't even bother replying. I've lost interest." You judged I'm "not a professional" from a single reply. 
Hey stupid, give me an example of a square with more or less than 4 sides. Oh, you can't? Are you saying you dismissed the other person's comment simply because it contradicted your pre-conceived idea of hard-coded class values? You're the one who appears unprofessional, buddy.
To be fair Java isn't the worst language to learn. At least it can be useful in the professional life, and once you know it it will be easy to learn other languages.
Don't know what g\_hunter is on about. That man obviously has access to squares with more sides than you and I.
This is great! Are computers common at home for students? Otherwise the legendary [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) would be nice for practicing cheaply at home.
That's the goal. They specifically say that the goal is not to produce python programmers. It's just that at the end of the day, general concept or not you need a tool to actually manipulate the concepts and the tool they choose is python.
For those who don't recognise the name: in the 2000s Joel Spolsky had a pretty famous blog about programming, and then he started a site you may have heard of Stack Overflow. It destroyed its competitor Experts Exchange in about 4 months and good riddance.
In what world is a dromedary not a camel though
I see nothing out of the normal here. What are you referring too?
Same one in which a zebra isn't commonly considered a horse. Two humps is the Bactrian camel, the type species of the genus... one hump is the Dromedary, _not_ the type species.
"Html" highlighted... Whats the problem? OP High AF
Java is slightly harder to pick up, but you end up with more translatable knowledge.
I think it's more meant to be a common point of entry to programming for students.
The Dromedary is the type species, and it's way more common, representing something like 95% of all camels.
Recent versions of Windows have restrictions on what you can do with files in certain directories, like C:\, C:\Windows, C:\Program Files\, etc. You might want to try moving the whole project into your Documents folder, and see if that helps.
Eh, couldn't remember his name, it's very generic. I hope your day gets better 😊
The magic that lets Git store every version while keeping repositories small is called [delta encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_encoding).
**Delta encoding** Delta encoding is a way of storing or transmitting data in the form of differences (deltas) between sequential data rather than complete files; more generally this is known as data differencing. Delta encoding is sometimes called delta compression, particularly where archival histories of changes are required (e.g., in revision control software). The differences are recorded in discrete files called "deltas" or "diffs". In situations where differences are small – for example, the change of a few words in a large document or the change of a few records in a large table – delta encoding greatly reduces data redundancy. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Thanks for the clarification. I'm not a native English speaker so I don't really get your first paragraph. When we say in French that a software is "libre" we clearly mean that it can be redistributed freely hence why the clarification in this link makes sense. When it comes to new things and software, we use English words and in this case "open-source" so we don't have to juggle between Free and free. Thanks for the link, I'll make sure to correctly use "open-source" or "logiciel libre"
I will try the library later. But can I just tell me how did you generate this documentation ? Is it sphinx ? I want to make my library have documentation like this
What someone called the campus cops on him ? LMAO
This page does not say any such thing. It's a consultation about the curriculum, and links to a whole bunch of proposals, one of which may propose the use of Python. 
Calling that ironic is like saying it's ironic cars drive on roads made of concrete. In other words there's nothing ironic. 
Smiles and cries man....
I'm using windows 7 and my python project is on another drive.
It often takes a little while for me to break junior engineers of the habit you’re recommending, but they thank me for it later. If you want to pass *every* value, you shouldn’t be wasting your time with classes. Make some closures and call it a day, because you get nothing from OOP when you’re passing in literally everything.
Thank you
Now I get it...
My office has adopted Black for that reason. It doesn’t matter whether I’m using VSCode and you’re using Notepad: our stuff still looks the same afterward. It derails so many unneeded arguments.
Good gracious, why? Who defines a class to be used as a variable? Why? Unholy.
Perhaps one could elaborate on said freelancing?
You're not wrong: “libre et gratuit” could mean “open-source and free.” I'm just being pedantic: only hard-core FSF folks really make a distinction between Free software and open-source software. Here's what I was trying to say in the first paragraph: The English language makes it hard to distinguish between _gratuit_ and _libre_. I was attempting to make that distinction by using “free” for _gratuit_ and “Free” for _libre_, but I probably should have used a less subtle translation.
But %s is faster than format.
holy bitterness, batman!
Criminy. That's both clever and horrifying. Good call on the replacements. 
Consider using f-strings.
Sure. Slower and more readable.
Uhm, if you stream them to s3 anyway, why don't you just drop em into cloudwatch and use that to filter? While it does not give you line numbers it provides the exact time, logged by stream and usually process id which makes it very easy to filter for the full process log and see what exactly went wrong where and when. I'm not 100% sure if the Hadoop deployments on aws actually support this, but this is how we do all our error logging for lambda/redshift/rds/dynamo. So I don't see why hadoop should not allow the same thing.
Then study Python on your own time? 
I'm currently working as a remote freelancer as I finish my computer engineering degree. I landed my current gig on Upwork, and to start out you get the bottom of the barrel jobs that pay poorly, but be good at customer service, and stand by your work. Once you get some feedback from clients you can start to get better jobs because people are more likely to trust you if you've had previous good feedback. To be fair though, my first gig was local but not really anything sustainable long term; I was doing some data cleaning and importation for a local record store for a couple hours a month.
I heard they even made python official language in France or is it already an official language?
Yeah, any advice on what I need to learn to start this? I would love to program python remotely for a living.
&gt; Fuck in my school they still teach java Depends on what you are going for. As a general education requirement for the population at large, python is a great choice. However for anyone then going on to a career in any kind of engineering/computer-related field, learning a statically typed, object-oriented language like JAVA is extremely good for the brain, as is learning one of the functional languages etc. You need to learn a wide variety of things in order to really be successful at the computer thing. In my experience, anyone who learned *just* python makes for a truly awful python programmer.
[removed]
Out of order... In MEMORY???
Yes. This was not intentional on the part of the original developer, but it passed the tests so was deployed to production. Where it continued to work. Until some totally unrelated code caused memory allocations to happen in different places whereupon it inexplicably broke.
where does the conda executable point to (i.e. is it the same place your python executable is) Is pip in your site-packages? More importantly, why are you using conda on linux (esp. if the first thing you are trying to do is to just install pip)?
This came just in time for me! Thanks! 
If you have time, I’d be very interested to hear about some scenarios where you’ve found *funky* to be useful. Or some specific problems it has solved for you? Or some “cool” things you think *funky* could be used for?
Trying to pull photos/videos from instagram profiles without any repeats using selenium... I'm already stuck on how to obtain the link to the photo/video itself from the profile page. UGH!
Wow! I can just imagine the smug "super coder" who chose that solution going, it's always going to be sequentially in memory, it's all in one thread anyway, so my solution works. Yeah, TECHNICALLY, still a stupid ass solution though. 
Cloning with some modification seems weird for me. I need to learn valix DSL like this \`/items/0/options\` for manipulating Python object. Maybe better use a builder or some other patterns for creating a modified object? Others things look nice. I will try to use this in my next project.
Well Pandas is basically numpy but better. Just more in depth data analysis. Pandas is pretty much built, fundamentally, off of numpy so it will be very similar. But it will be much higher tier basically. &amp;#x200B; Numpy is a bit more ground level, while still covering a lot of ground, whereas Pandas is more specialized in its field. Particularly data analysis and the streamlining of it.
In this case it was a junior dev just mashing the keyboard until something that looked like it was working came out.
My python executable is the conda python. Yes pip is there but it gives a bad interpreter error on trying to execute it. Why would I not use conda on linux? Also, the first thing I am doing is not installing pip but I removed the python-pip and things broke.
I guess it depends on how many methods you’re adding. If you’re implementing “what’s the area of an n-sided square”, though, then there’s no point dragging a class along for the helluvit.
Now we call that “Enum”. (Which I like and use a lot, BTW.)
thanks for the input. could you elaborate what's this Upwork all about? 
yeah, could you explain what medium did you use to land your first remote freelance job as a python dev? 
It's a double sided marketplace where freelancer can find clients and clients can find freelancers. Upwork.com
how so?
execfile
When I think “hard coded”, I think of strings used as dict keys in 15 different places, like `result[‘customer_id’]`, such that you’re boned if you need to change that string everywhere or if you typo it in one location. Then I’d ask the person I’m reviewing to write `CUST_ID = ‘customer_id’` and use the constant everywhere. Or now, if there are lots of similar keys, to make an Enum of them. But that `Square.num_sides` goofiness would earn a talking to.
okay. can freelancers who like to work remote also make use of it? and how roughly how much do these "low paying jobs" pay? 
so basically they re-implemented bit flags as classes. that's awesome. hopefully they mirrored all the bitwise operations so they can properly work with these class flags :D
Don't quote me on this, but I think French might be the official language in France
**Coding conventions** Coding conventions are a set of guidelines for a specific programming language that recommend programming style, practices, and methods for each aspect of a program written in that language. These conventions usually cover file organization, indentation, comments, declarations, statements, white space, naming conventions, programming practices, programming principles, programming rules of thumb, architectural best practices, etc. These are guidelines for software structural quality. Software programmers are highly recommended to follow these guidelines to help improve the readability of their source code and make software maintenance easier. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
This was many years ago, but from memory this was part of the code: def __lt__(a, b): return a &lt; b
Better to fall from grace with grace than to fall with bitterness.
This has been a *huge* win for us. First off, yes, I hate wrapping strings in double quotes. I think they got that wrong. But the benefits of having tiny PRs in GitHub because everyone’s code looks alike, regardless of editor, makes up for it. After a little while I’ve stopped notice the places where it makes a different decision than I would, and now I can write run-on lines of code like defining a nested dictionary without pausing to make it look pretty. When I save the file, Black will fix it. LPT: add a target in your build system so you can run something like `make itblack` to emblacken the whole project at once. Then people who haven’t set up their editors yet have a single command they can run before they file a PR that does the right thing.
I'm from Kazakhstan. When I was in 10-11th grades (2011-2013), I was taught Python a bit. Unfortunately, there weren't enough hours and the teaching was not so good so I failed to grasp it (or maybe it's just me being stupid :D).
&gt; Citation needed. The google. Last tested with Python 3.6.0 (along with some not relevant data to this topic; e.g., string concatenation). It's a solid 2x faster. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40714555/python-string-formatting-is-more-efficient-than-format-function &gt; It's no longer such a sticking point it seems and I no longer see references to % style removal The PSF said they'd never remove %s, but yeah, I saw it too. It was people wanting to change things, rather than for an actual advantage. At least f-strings are easier to read; a lot easier.
Sounds good - keen to read it!
Yup, I work remotely through it! It depends, a lot of the low paying jobs are fixed priced contracts and I had to do two of them one for $20 and one for $70 and they both took way more time than I would've liked. But then I got a contract for $25/hr and now my current job is $40/hr and long term. I started on Upwork in June so I'm pretty stoked with where I'm at now.
congrats to you dude. :)) 
Not since 3.6 https://bugs.python.org/issue27078
According to [Python developer's guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0471/), **os.scandir()** is a better and faster directory iterator. &gt;Python's built-in os.walk() is significantly slower than it needs to be, because -- in addition to calling os.listdir() on each directory -- it executes the stat() system call or GetFileAttributes() on each file to determine whether the entry is a directory or not. &amp;#x200B;
Yeah, I don't have the cultural background to know the nuance that comes into play when capitalising the word free or not
Thanks 😊 Hard work and luck got me here
Nice

I'd suggest first to break down the problem into domains, logically. One for data reading, another for data processing, and one for output. Create a folder for each one, Google how to create modules. Each module can have a class in it. Then in main.py or something, import these modules, and create a processing function calling these classes with if statements, e.g if CsvProcessor.has_file() or something like that, then Data processor.calculate_foo(), something along those lines.

Hmm, appears you're correct about the type species -- ahh the failing memory of age -- though only the two humped "true" camels still exist in the wild and the non-domesticated ancestors would have had two humps (apparently the dromedary fetus has a two-hump developmental stage and the adult retains a vestigial second hump)... perhaps that accounts for why there's a general preference for dromedary as the more accurate name for the one-humped variety.
I find it rude to be handed an answer and do nothing with it. Especially since it was the correct answer. if you had looked at what was printed by my first answer there would have been no reason to ask what turned out to be your second question.
Poor, sad folks. This being a thread about Python though I'll still call it a code smell in this language, where that behavior doesn't hold.
You get used to it and it doesn't seem so bad, but yes the best code practice is the one for the language you're using.

may i ask how much do you earn now? 
It's not a FAQ or Q&amp;A type of post. It's a YouTube tutorial on handing json data with python. Would your say, not it is suited for the subreddit. 
Yes, here it is: https://wemake-django-template.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/template/upgrading-template.html#goodbye-pipenv It was quite easy to do. 
btw what languages did you know when you did the very first job?

From [Wikipedia.org entry for Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) &gt;Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of packs that store a large number of objects delta-compressed among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a packfile. See also [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Internals-Packfiles](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Internals-Packfiles) You can find these pages via your prefered search engine. But as u/athermop says this question is not related to Python.
Yes, you can embed bokeh plots for websites.. https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/embed.html
Sure. I started at $35/hour, moved to $40 after 10 months and then to $50 a little after the 2 year mark
So, he's a blind programmer?
Thank you!
Thank you!
But why would you do this? This seems like such a scary thing to do... this may result in virtually anything, even downgrading your packages... Is this some form of chaos testing or something like that?
So you can no longer get your expert sex change?
We have [a pretty long list of learning resources in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index#wiki_new_to_programming.3F). Try a few and see what resonates. For a brand new programmer I'd recommend automate the boring stuff with python. Also, if you don't have one already make sure you look for a project that interests you and start on it as soon as you can. Programming is a lot more fun if you have a goal. Come visit us in /r/learnpython if you get stuck. 
Okay, you know what they say. Out of performance, security, and ease of use/modularity, pick two. Which one should I be worried about? Especially given the extreme increase in performance based on the benchmarks (which btw, I can't check out the source on mobile, I assume because that's delegated to a C extension?).
The bad part about this is there's two types of AP CS. AP CS A (Java, equivalent to the general college "intro to programming and OOP" and general programming concepts class, like recursion, inheritance, dynamic dispatch, etc) and AP CS Principles. Principles is hot garbage. No college I know of offers any credit for it whatsoever. The majority of it is in some psuedo code language or just general computer literacy, and a large chunk of the test is a presentation/project about some piece of tech that interests the student.
The very first job I was only really familiar with python and had taken a course in MATLAB (but I had been developing in python as a hobbyist for two-three years before then). And I was pretty familiar with linux shell-scripting since I had been playing around with linux since I was a kid. I ended up learning some PHP and SQL on the job so that I could upgrade their website. No matter what languages you know, you can always learn what you need for the job at hand. It's really about being persistent and open to new ways of thinking. (And also not being afraid to learn while you're not being paid).
Hey all, Long time observer here but given I wrote this article and it’s getting some looks feel free to reach out if you have any questions! Thanks for checking it out 🙏🏼
We don’t need to resort to name-calling. While I too disagree with their idea, we can be polite about it. \
I liike.
It stores the differences. If the first version of a string is aaaaa, and the second is aaaab, you don't need to store ten characters to represent this. You just need to record that the last letter changed to a b.

Great article
/r/flask and Miguel Grinberg's flask mega-tutorial should help.
Made a little script that checks the tier 2/3 helpdesk at work for new tickets. if there is, it starts randomly flashing all the phillips hue lights red and changing their brightness for 15 seconds. So far no one is annoyed. 
All web pages are written in html.
Both are called camel case. It's a nice alliteration, easy to understand and remember and covers everything you need. Once you need separate terminology to differentiate the case of a single letter per word it just means you've been leading a pointless argument for way too long.
Under `code/`, I see a `.ipynb` file. That's a [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebook containing Python code. To run it, you'll download a copy of the code on a machine with Jupyter installed on a suitable version of Python and open the notebook. The code in the notebook presumably imports the .py files that are distributed with it.
Is somebody suffering from a case of premature optimization?
If you want a shared server that any student can upload images to, that will require someone with some Python experience to design a suitable interface and write some glue code to call the published code from that interface.
Well at least your dictator care for education and science. Thanks to our dictator erdogan we don't have any universities in top 500 anymore. 
Actually no. What's your field? I don't do web-based programming. I'm an aerospace engineer. I often work with huge datasets (20+ million nodes and 20+ million tet elements). I work with legacy Fortran file formats and do I/O (with stuff in-between) with them that can take 30 minutes to run. If I care about speed, I use %i, %f, %s, etc. If I don't, I'll use an f-string. str.format is the worst of all worlds.
Wrapp that 'wall' object in class that inherits from pygame.sprite.Sprite and voila, make as many instances as you want.
I think you need to make a `Shape` class, and then make a `Square` inherit from a `Shape` with `4` sides.
Great success!
Speaking of suspiciously separate terminologies; alliteration with Cs is called consonance. I said "mostly facetious" way back when for a reason.

Oh i wasn't actually refering to the gui - rather the datamodel behind Django. Djangos model based approach takes all the annoying work of working with SQLite out of your hands and it makes extending the schema later a lot easier. Of course you could have the django service also run in a webserver displaying the data and use django for what it was actually built for - creating a website based on your data and stuff and making displaying that data easy. It'd be an option either way though in my opinion.
What libraries were you using in Python? I've always had better soeed with Python over R. Although, that could be me lesser experience with R as well 
&gt; I'm working on a highly optimized code Python is probably the wrong language for you. &gt; but that is still 1 more instruction than needed for every shift. Python integers add hundreds of instructions behind the scenes. &gt; is there any way to tell python to use the underlying 64 bit representation and behave as C would? Not with a python integer, no. But you can use an external, C-based library like numpy. &gt;&gt;&gt; a = np.array(255, dtype=np.uint8) &gt;&gt;&gt; a array(255, dtype=uint8) &gt;&gt;&gt; a &lt;&lt;= 3 &gt;&gt;&gt; a array(248, dtype=uint8) 
I'd happily use something else, but it's a school assignment and I have to use python...
Can you use cython? If so you can write optimized C code and use it from python. 
What would that look like in code? I can't seem to make it work.
/r/LearnPython might be better for this questions, but the library you will want (assuming it’s Microsoft excel) is probably “xlrd” and you might also want to use regular expressions.
That's not related to PyQT per se, in Python itself most things are objects

&gt;Any Python2-only compliant code (e.g. print "hi", or using %s instead of .format) Note that byte-strings \*gained\* use of % interpolation in Python 3.5. It's not going away, and % interpolation is, by definition, not "Python2-only".

Hey /u/RinAsougi, I have some experience with Plotly and Dash but personally always found myself coming back to Bokeh. I find Bokeh a little more straightforward for building visualizations (and also think it looks a little better out of the box). Plus, their documentation is top notch. However, Dash is very well suited for spinning up dashboards. With that said, Bokeh also has some built-in affordances to do so (which would be an excellent follow-up to this article). Chartify definitely looks super cool, and I plan to dig into it a little further. As a data scientist focused on Apple Music, though, I’m not sure if I’m allowed to like it. 😉 (Totally kidding!)

&gt;intCustCount As an example, what kind of "count" variable in Python would ever not be an int? (or an int derived type, etc) Certainly this is a prime example of the "int" part being totally redundant. &amp;#x200B; &gt;strLastName Similarly, with strings now being unicode in Python 3, what last name could ever be stored in a LastName variable that wouldn't be a python "str"? &amp;#x200B; &gt;since they aren't terribly ambiguous Right, I'd say it's a much more powerful condition than that. There is simply no other builtin type possible in the cases you suggested, and if there were, it would be \*those\* oddly-typed variables that should perhaps be named with the type, leaving it out for the common cases. In other words, "intCustCount" offers literally no beneficial information over "custCount" (or "cust\_count") as a variable name. &amp;#x200B; Just something to consider, and one of the reasons hungarian notation can be despised when it's used inappropriately.

I take your point, I just think the objection is really a personal one. I'm new to Python and most of my work has been with very strongly typed, oop reliant languages where you could quickly get lost in the sea of identifiers whose name alone wasn't enough to immediately suss out what they were . I started using Hungarian notation to make my life easier, which it did and so I've never stopped. For example edtCustName tells me it's a GUI Editor object with a String property for the value, where just CustName would have told me exactly jack and/or shit). On top of that my "obfuscation" experiences have been pretty harsh and I never want to be "that guy" who's name is cursed because of shit code. If someones primary complaint against me is that I use Hungarian notation I'll take it. I will say that my very limited use of Python so far has been refreshing since it seems that the paradigm is more about doing things well straight forward rather than just adhering to a paradigm. When you are in the weeds you see OOP as being "that which must be" when really a lot of the time it was more trouble than it was worth. But I digress, I hope you see my comments as just my perspective, I'm not trying to have a religious debate about right and wrong. :-) 
Open folder where you have your file and on the address bar write cmd and press enter
&gt; alliteration with Cs is called consonance … no. consonance is a generalization of alliteration, not a special case for a particular letter.
Interesting! I will say that all the AP classes and tests that I took seemed considerably less difficult than their college-course equivalents, but I can't imagine what 'computer literacy' would even pretend to substitute for.
Quick side note: python _is_ strongly typed. It's also dynamically typed, which is along a different axis.
Your professional programmer doesn't have much Python experience. I would personally send that merge request back with a requirement to replace that with appropriate type annotations, like: ``` muffins: List[Muffin] = [] ```
I know. I was just trying to figure out what OP was trying to show. Threw a shot in the dark that was it. 
Could you share the why behind this? Thanks
&gt;I take your point, I just think the objection is really a personal one. Sure, that's why I ended with it being just "something to consider". More specifically, like with your "edt" prefix example, that's maybe an example where context isn't enough to indicate what behavior the variable has, and so a little naming help is a big benefit. It just happened that the specific examples for things like "str" or "int" name-prefixes are often the cases where such notation may be unwarranted because they are the expected types. Quite often, in Python, we don't care about the \*type\* of an object, but we very much want to know the behavior. So it may not matter that it's a list, a tuple, or a string, but we need to know if its a "sequence", and can treat it that way (ie. the "duck typing" philosophy). So it's common to name such variables generically as "seq". Sadly, it can matter if it's a list or string sequence, since they often need to be treated differently in practice; though rather than adding a type name to the variable, it's more typical to simply test the object to see if it behaves more like a list or a string, and handle it based on those results (ie. we may want to iterate over a list of strings, but not over the sequence of characters in those strings, etc.) From that perspective, in an ideal world, you might envision not caring whether you were given a string or a GUI Editor object containing a string, assuming you want to manipulate both as if they were just a string without losing type information in doing so. In such an ideal world you'd be able to just consider it a CustName without caring at all about the actual type... In practice, this isn't always achievable (at least not easily), but in theory it \*is\* possible with Python, and when such behaviors are supported by a library or tool it can be very elegant. &amp;#x200B; &gt;I hope you see my comments as just my perspective Certainly! Seeing other perspectives is an important way to learn, and it's one reason I think it's never worth getting too dogmatic about any particular practice; often it's there for a reason, and we learn more by understanding those reasons than just dismissing the practice out of hand.

There's a significant difference between Simonyi's Hungarian Notation and the resultant bastardization that is Microsoft Hungarian^[1](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/05/11/making-wrong-code-look-wrong/). In Simonyi's horribly-named "type notation", the the type **domain** is part of the variable name. Got a string that is escaped for HTML? `he_name`. How about SQL-escaped? `se_name`. Essentially, information that is *not* part of the type, but is part of the data's usage, gets encoded into the variable name. This allows domain errors to be caught more easily: `se_name = he_name` looks *wrong*, because the domain prefixes don't match. This is good, because the problem can't be encoded in the type system of the language, so it has to be encoded at the level of the programmer. In Microsoft Hungarian, this was confused by Simonyi calling it "type notation", and all that was heard was "type". So, the type of the variable, which is totally discoverable via tooling, is crammed onto the front of the variable, which aids nothing: `str_name1` vs `str_name2`. This is all to say that I hope you use the former :)
grasp is arguably not too well known, but solid is an industry standard for application development. if you're doing more academic stuff, data science, functional or procedural programming, or maybe some other disciplines, it might not as relevant, but for anything heavily OOP you should look it up. you're probably doing a lot of it any way, but it gives you a terminology to communicate complex ideas
And yet your first answer gave me more error responses, I'm not sure where you wanted me to place that since it doesn't work alone in it's own function nor added into name\_dog, granted the issue with it is i was never defined but I'm not even sure what you wanted me to do with "i" thus I ask the question; " How would this help search for an object attribute?" Just pretend I'm a moron or something and explain it please.

This was a [good suggestion](https://github.com/thoppe/pixelhouse/issues/21), and it was easy to add a better way to escape animations! Version 0.1.5 now escapes animations with any key and should respect your REPL more. `pip install -u pixelhouse`. I'll keep thinking about the other stuff.
Lol I just made something to calculate hypotenuse of triangle after the user inputs side a and b. # Calculates hypotenuse of a right angled triangle. from math import sqrt print('Enter the sides') a = float(input('Side a: ')) b = float(input('Side b: ')) hypo = a ** 2 + b ** 2 print('The hypotenuse is ' + str(sqrt(hypo)) + '.') &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; If you're spending 30 minutes on I/O (and stuff in between?) then a minute or so doing the actual work why are you bent out of shape about formatting? Cause the I/O is the slow part. Optimizing string formatting makes sense. Again, I don't care if it's just one message. I care if it's 20 million or more.
Human Resource machine. Quite fun and gets a little challenging towards the end. Anyone can do the first few levels but unless you have some programming background quite hard to complete. https://store.steampowered.com/app/375820/Human_Resource_Machine/
I have however had issues with bokeh parsing all files I'm a folder as separate url graphs. It's supposed to be able to do that but I've had no such luck.
So 30 minutes on string formatting? Or actual disk reads/writes?
Yea, looks to be a bug
And although its only marginally a game, this has python. https://www.codingame.com
It's a safety net that costs you, and in a dynamically typed language it costs you a lot. First, _any_ use of duck-typing completely invalidates the value of the notation. Sure, to someone for whom your code is a black box an error referencing **strFoo** might hint that they need to replicate the interface of a **str**, but sitting right beside that hint is the _actual_ part of the interface they need to replicate. Second, you're introducing a maintenance nightmare should the need arise to permanently change the type; changing a **list** to a **deque** doesn't change the semantic meaning of a variable, but you've forced me to hunt for _every_ reference you've ever made to it. Worse -- if it's library code and your variable could be considered part of the public API -- you've forced me to the hunt for every reference _someone else_ has made to it. So we either maintain your name but invalidate it's meaning or we pay your technical debt and **strCurse** your memory. Third, it cannot be trusted at the same time that it cannot be introspected; unless you've included an assert below every use the implied promise that **strThing** actually is a **str** can't be known to hold. And if I ever do want to verify you've kept your promises I need to write a parser for your personal naming scheme. Type annotations are _so_ much better. Basically Hungarian Notation is a safety net for you and a PITA for everyone that follows you. And, in Python, it's an indication that the code was written by someone who didn't understand or trust the features of the language. Features which certainly do introduce their own issues, but issues for which other features and idioms of the language exist to address. And, in the end, it's always someone transposing lessons learned in a statically-typed language that has no introspection into a dynamically-typed language that does.

It's a generalization of alliteration using consonants; c is a consonant. As is s, which is -- you'll notice -- one of the two letters I chose to use to demonstrate consonance above.
It is an app too.

Despite what many people say, disk read/write is fast. I wrote a library that parse a very inefficiently structured 2 GB Fortran binary file is 4 seconds on an SSD. Casting ints/floats/strings is what's slow. If you write a parser for integer/float data and you don't really need the int/float data and can get by with just strings, it will be much faster, 100x faster or more.
The accepted answer in the very post you linked to shows that f-strings are the fastest. &gt; **tl;dr** - Python string formatting performance : f-strings are fastest So if you care about performance, you use f-strings. If you care about readability, you also use f-strings. 
This is because Python starts searching for modules in the current working directory. The problem here is PyCharm: It sets the cwd to the toplevel path of the program, which means that the files under `util` are accessable under `src.util`. To fix this, you can go to the configurations dialogue and change the cwd there.
You misread the table.

&gt; It's a safety net that costs you, and in a dynamically typed language it costs you a lot. Sure if I had been working with a dynamically typed language (which I wasn't). Like I said, I'm new to Python. &gt;you're introducing a maintenance nightmare should the need arise to permanently change the type I'm sure I'd have nightmare regardless if it came down to not knowing how to type appropriately to begin with. &gt; it's always someone transposing lessons learned in a statically-typed language that has no introspection into a dynamically-typed language that does. I've spent 99% of my career with static typing. It is what it is. My foray into Python is for my own interest and edification, it isn't what puts food on the table. Certainly I can see and understand the view point on disliking it. Though I would argue that dynamic typing in and of itself is problematic (imo), perhaps that's just so much static time warping my view. When I asked the question it wasn't to defend the notation to the death, I was curious. Perhaps I shouldn't have been, I didn't realize using it made me such a bad programmer... 
Second best language for everything indeed!
I'm currently slugging my way though some monte carlo integration simulations and I have no idea what I am doing! Woo hoo! lol. I really wanted to like Python and be good at it, but my data science program is making us do things that are way too complicated for our skill level, so this has been majorly frustrating instead of enjoyable. BUT, I'm glad the rest of you are working on some cool stuff and enjoying yourselves! :)
The code is here: [https://github.com/neozhaoliang/pywonderland/blob/master/src/gifmaze/example\_hilbert\_curve.py](https://github.com/neozhaoliang/pywonderland/blob/master/src/gifmaze/example_hilbert_curve.py) It' a pure python program and runs surprisingly fast for making gif animations. It was designed for making maze animations but last night I realized that it can also draw spacing filling curves \~

I'm happiest about seeing ocaml in the list
Fascinating! Where can I read more about this?
Have you looked at [sage](http://www.sagemath.org/)? 
This is a thread about code smells in Python, and Hungarian Notation _is_ a code smell in Python. It's not -- necessarily -- in other languages. So using it doesn't make you a bad programmer, but using it in Python very likely makes you a bad Python programmer. And sure, dynamic typing is problematic, even fatal, for the subset of problems for which static typing is a requisite... but static typing is an unnecessary, even crippling, hindrance to the subset of problems in which it isn't a requisite. There's a reason why it's one of the fundamental choices a language makes, and also why there's no "right" choice and plenty of languages modern and mature exist across the continuum of those choices. The problems arise when someone takes the ideas and patterns from one corner of the Strong/Weak, Static/Dynamic diagram and tries to apply them in a language written for another corner. So, for instance, the notion of "typing appropriately" is a bit of a silly idea in Python... you choose the sensible starting type and you swap it out for something better if it comes along, and you're fundamentally empowered to do so by the language and your ability to make anything mimic anything else. You're _always_ writing generics _unless_ you choose to more strongly type them; polymorphism is the default... and that is a _good_ thing when you're prototyping. It's a bad thing once you know your problem and it can be set in concrete, and that's when you break out C and start writing extensions. And, when you do so, you'll notice that the cPython implementers tend to lean heavily on Hungarian Notation. Why? Cause it's appropriate and a good habit in C, it's just not in Python.
Wrong on every account there, first off I'm studying Python, I'm learning the basics and making a text base adventure game as practice, my code above is my text code so I don't have to go through every process to check if something is working throughout my whole code. Secondly this has been the first question I've asked because I've been searching for the answer for well over a week with no results on it, I'm sure you can understand how frustrating that can be, as for everything else I have been noting in a text document, researching into the enumerate function as we have been talking about "rudeness", as a follow up I'm sorry that my process of learning through example is considered bad. And lastly I did not ignore the sidebar rules, I took the bots advice and reposted this to the correct sub reddit days ago, only reason this has been kept open is so I could get a full expectation to your answer. So thank you for your help but please stop being a judgemental dick.
Fingerspelling is from a sign language (in this case American Sign Language). It is very beneficial when EARS don’t work perfectly, it’s the visual delivery method requiring working eyes (tactile delivery is usually reserved for people both deaf and blind)
you mean the transitionf from blue to red looks discontinous? You can change this by using another palette for the global color table. For example: 1. just use two colors in the palette ``` surface.set_palette([0, 0, 0, 0, 255, 255]) ``` 2. change the return of the function `color_pixel` to ``` def color_pixel(index): return 1 ```
Yep! Change the colour encoding to a circular format.
OH I know the right way to remedy this: traverse the rgb space using another hilbert walk, then adjacent vertices will also get adjacent colors.

So now I get it, "i" wasn't even supposed to be a thing in your answer, that really threw me through me through a loop because I didn't get what you meant, and I've got a understanding of what enumerate does (really should of just told me to use that), but yeah, so I just need to run enumerate with a if command under it, righto thanks for the help.
The critical information is missing: what's the error you are getting? Remember, we can't see your display. 
The problem is fixed now and I have uploaded the new code. One can simply change i/360.0 to i/.256.0 in the hls\_to\_rgb function call.
Please, put it in your post body for others to see.
Looks like two balls at the bottom and a dick going up. 
Figure out the data structure of the output from scoreboard.txt. Attempt to retrieve the values in a different method Ex Score = line[0] # get first item in list Player = line[1] #get 2nd item in list ‘store result in tuple’ player_result = (Score, Player) Or ‘Store result in dictonary’ player_result = { ‘score’ : Score, ‘player’ : Player } Also import random belongs at the top of the modue
/r/oddlysatisfying 
Yeah, at first I understood that it took you only one second to write the code. Now *that* would have been truly impressive.
Thanks man, really helped 
&gt; player\_result = { ‘score’ : Score, ‘player’ : Player } Mat 4 Mat 4 Mat 4 &amp;#x200B; it now just prints the same score and player instead of taking 5 different ones from the txt file
The main performance boost achieved using Do-Repeat-Yourself concept. For example, each validator starts with the following code: if value is None and self.nullable: return value Yes, there are no “reusable” functions like `check_none(value)` or `check_min(value, min_value)`. At first glance, it breaks common best practices. However, I don't think so. Because it makes code more readable. You can open the sources of any validator and easily understand how it works. And it also eliminates function call overhead. That is why even pure Python version of ValidX is still faster then other popular libraries (only [Validr](https://github.com/guyskk/validr) beats it, but it implemented on Cython). Getting back to your question. 1. Performance definitely is not an issue. 2. Security? If you afraid of potential malware hidden in compiled C-extensions, which is fair enough, you can get source code, audit it, and compile it by your own. There is no any black magic. 3. Ease of use and modularity? Given my note above, modularity may be some kind of issue. But it doesn't affect on end user API, i.e. ease of use is not an issue also.
If you hadn't said anything, I wouldn't have known that English wasn't your first language. One of the hardest parts of speaking another language fluently is having enough mastery of the syntax and vocabulary, but not having the shared cultural foundation to grasp all of the idioms. The Simpsons in French works really well because the translators grasped that (plus the voice actors are great). (Of course, I have to watch it in VO because I don't have that shared background.)
