Somehow got attorney and budget in the same sentence, either luck or pure algorithm
I would love to, really, but the program will never resolve because it's so expensive it's completely clogged up, so I can't get any information out of the profiler. Is there a kind of profiler that can run like an Activity Monitor, that prints out efficiency information about the pieces of code that are running and what % they're taking up or time they're taking to execute while running?
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/memory_profiler
&gt;&gt; And I mean, you shouldn't pick a language because some company picks a language. &gt; Yes, you should. If X company using Y language is the primary (or only) consideration for you choosing Y language that's just chasing fads. &gt; That they've opted to use a particular language is an expert endorsement. Yeah, but an endorsement is not a mandate. If someone recommends I use a particular language, I'll take it under advisement _after_ I finish evaluating how well suited it is for what I'm doing and my time constraints (just as /u/redditpentester says), including whether or not I'm going to have to spend time learning the language, toolchain, and ecosystem before I even get started on my project.
Just run it on 6 or 10 or 600 of the sites?
This not a helpful python hint, but how about pressing play at the same time, by messaging in chat "go!" or something of that sort? Years before online streaming was a thing, friends and I would watch movies together using IRC or other text chat, we would designate one person the starter, and when they said "count" in chat, everyone would count from three, and press go at the same time. We never successfully set up scripts to do it for us, but we were a bunch of noob script kiddies.
Of course everyone has dealt with worse logical errors, but why make it so easy to add another. You're comment screams to me that you've never worked on a large project with other developers. Not everyone is as smart as you, my point is simply that this is a very simple mistake that the language could easily prevent. It's not that hard to miss a single comma in a 20 element array, again of course this is a beginner mistake, but it's an easy mistake that even a senior engineer can make when they're burning midnight oil. Again I'm not saying this is a common mistake, I'm saying it's easy to make and there isn't a good reason for it other than "making multi line strings slightly easier". Who has so many multi line strings in their code that this should be a feature? Most app strings are a sentence or less and if they're longer they're probably in a database. It doesn't matter how great a dev you are, when you have to interact with code written by other engineers you will likely encounter bugs. This is an easy bug to prevent at the language level with virtually no loss in functionality. I know they aren't going to make the change now, but they should have when they released python3.
Nobody should bother with /r/learnpython as some of the advice there is either poor or plain downright wrong. Telling the perpetrators upsets them as they think they know everything so clearly the main Python mailing list, the tutor mailing list or even stackoverflow are vastly superior, and I've seen some crap on the latter. "Why have you down voted my perfectly good answer?". "Because it's not the one liner the OP asked for".

I personally think its the brain tendency to want to meaning no matter what 
I haven't the faintest idea what you're asking for, please rephrase your question?
Scale out the processing into multiple machines. Create task/queue system for scraping, parsing, and saving the data. You don't have time to optimize right now.
How about we replace `,` making up a tuple with `(,)` making up a tuple then? Because noobs might get confused and forget that something is actually a tuple. Also it's not easy to add another. You want to write another variable into a list? Well you add comma before doing so.
There are a number of different programming language paradigms (imperative, object-oriented, functional, logic, etc.), and they each encourage you to think about programming in a different way. Learning at least one language from each major paradigm gives you an excellent basis for learning new programming languages. While you already have a preference for Python, I think it will help you to learn to think and program Java-style. By all means, compare how the Java way of doing things differs from the Python way, but don't try to resist learning to think in Java just because thinking in Python comes more naturally. 
The urls are fed to the main function through a queue. Is that what you mean? I can ask the other devs about multiple machines. I don't have any other machines to work with, but once I hand it off hopefully they'll have something far stronger to run this on
I'll second that. To the OP I'd say look for a new job, as the clanking of spurs in a cowboy organisation can be replaced by the peace and quiet of a professional company that actually understands just how difficult the software development process is.
Oh, I've already got one. But, I mean, I'm pretty sure they're aware? Either they suckered me in, or they actually think this is no big deal. Considering that there's two of them that on Feb 1st started rewriting the entirety of their release project together with the same release date, I'm pretty sure it's the latter. 
I have some C++ code that needs to be formatted in a specific way. I've written a Python script to automatically format the code. I would like this script to automatically execute every time I build the C++ project in Visual Studio 2013. Is it possible to do this, and if so how would I do it?
Thanks for the hints, will try them tomorrow. However, do you know how should I safely remove my actual Python3.6 installation? Or I might just re-install again overwriting it?
Embrace both! Different languages lend themselves to different ways of thinking about problems. Knowing a variety of different languages helps you learn new approaches so you can pick the best one for the task at hand. Knowing multiple different languages makes you a better programmer in *any* language. My advice would be to embrace Java, and not just for your classes. Try not to just think in Python and translate it to Java; learn to think in Java too. Learn the idioms. Use the common patterns. You know the Pythonic way of doing things, now try the Java-esque way.
Hi there. I've been learning django and I'm looking for something open source to contribute to. I just starred the project. I'm TheGeoLawton. 
Thanks for this. I've actually been looking for a tutorial on this for a while. Awesome !!!!
There’s literally a bullet on that page which reads “Cartopy, New Management, and EoL Announcement”.
Just launch more ec2 instances. Or if you just want to optimize your parsing code omit the HTML tree parsing step and try to hack your way there with basic text searching. I write scraping software for a living. If you want to give me a call I can try to answer your questions. Just PM me your info.
No, it's still very much the case.
Have they rewritten DCM in something else? Angular 1 was extracted from work on that. 
No no course but I have been working through a book that just seemed to click with me "Beginning Python From Novice to Professional Third Edition" and the you tube channel "DrapsTV" python beginner intermediate and advanced. Read a bit, watch, use it, read more use it, start over try to write better code. Just hope I am not developing some bad habits on the way. 
Why does it come with a version of bash from the 90s? Why did it come with ancient Apache for ages? Apple don't particularly care that much about updating third party dev tools.
Front is React
I appreciate it, actually Sending now! 
You did a make altinstall thankfully. AFAIK just run make altinstall again and it will overwrite the previously copied files. If you really want to remove it, it's a bunch of "python-3.6" folders in /usr/bin and /usr/lib somewhere. Check the output of your make altinstall command or run "make -n altinstall" to do a dry run, and see what it's going to copy
I know there is a problem with licensing. For example, Apple is stuck with an obsolete rsync because they are not allowed to preload later open source versions due to changes in licensing rules. But since the latest OSX is free I don't see how it matters anymore. Unless the rules apply to for-profit hardware with open source software installed.
Ah okay. Im don't know that much about Web Development. What exactly ist React (JS Framework?) or better what does it do and at which point is it integrated into Django?
&gt;Oh okay I'll just do everything in Swift, since that's what Apple would want &gt;me to do. Or maybe C#, even though .NET is almost entirely tied down to &gt;OS-specific cases. Sigh. Apple produces Swift and Microsoft produces .NET. That's something completely different. &gt; Or maybe I should just dump Python for R because a lot of fintech &gt;companies use R. Well, if you're working in financial tech, that would actually be a reason to choose R. The point is... let's say a numeric library is used by CERN, Fermilab and Los Alamos National Laboratory. Do you think these organizations just picked a library at random? Do you think they haven't expertly evaluated the options? If some of the biggest labs in the world are using library X, it's certainly going to be good enough to handle your project. There's a reason every open source project that scores a major corporate user brags about it on their web page. It's an endorsement regarding the quality of the project. &gt;OR! I should make everything "blockchain" because people keep talking &gt;about that and even Disney and Burger King use "blockchain technology", &gt;right? Right??? You know full well what I meant. A standard definition of when a language has gone mainstream is "in use by a multinational corporation on an infrastructure project". That has nothing to do with fads; it has to do with acceptance, capability and quality. If I'm looking to hire an accounting firm for my business and they tell me they've worked with Exxon and IBM, that's not "following a fad" to choose them; it's recognizing that if they can handle such large clients they can certainly handle my company. People choosing to misread this obvious truth are just being silly. &gt;Oh wait, what you're saying is actually horrible advice and I should stick &gt;with educating myself on the best solutions tailored for the task I'm facing, &gt;like any responsible coder. Go work for a serious company and try to pitch a technology choice that no one's ever heard of because you're a "responsible coder". You could also be a Pascal or Visual Basic fanboy pushing your favorite tech. They're going to want to know who else has used it. The last time I was involved in choosing parts of a stack for a company any open source library had to have not one but two corporate sponsors. It was a tough criterion but it made sense for a critical piece of software. Software developers don't steer the ship - and for good reason. &gt;Meanwhile when they ask you in the interview, "So why do you use &gt;Python?", you can maintain your answer of "Because they do." while &gt;everyone else gives an answer that shows they actually understand what &gt;it is they're doing. This is getting ridiculous. If you're working in data science and you choose to code everything in Pascal or Pharo because that's just what you like you better stay self-employed. Who loses a job by answering "Python is the mainstream, dominant choice in this software field?" &gt;Wait... cashflow associated with a company immediately means you &gt;should use the programming language, regardless of your use-case? If someone is risking a billion dollars on the product, they've done more due diligence than you ever will. This is starting to read like a fanboy's plea to base a company's infrastructure on an esoteric language. &gt; That has to be the dumbest thing I've read today. Actually, it's so common sense a business practice I'm laughing that you're disputing it. Every company in existence promotes major clients. It's a foundational concept: "If we're good enough for &lt;best in the world at whatever&gt;, we're good enough for you". If our diodes are used on the International Space Station, they're capable enough for your toy car. If the Navy SEALs use our gear, it's good enough for you to go hunting with. How is this a dumb concept? &gt; Keurig makes a lot of money selling coffee machines but I'm not going to &gt;start stuffing shit into little plastic cups and adding hot water just because &gt;it works for them and their product. That doesn't even relate to what we're talking about. If an accounting company has Keurig as a client, yes, you will use them because Keurig does, because you're not close to being as big as Keurig. &gt;By your own logic, we should all still be using Assembly because it sure &gt;worked for IBM in the 50s and 60s! If it were the 50s and 60s, then yes. If not, you've gone off the rails to take offense at **obvious logic**. Heck, I remember when New England Motor Freight opened a terminal in a particular city. When I asked the sales director why, he explained that Jevic had just done so. Since they're about the same size and serve the same region, they figured that if Jevic needed a terminal here, they did too. 
I love you, and your work, Olav. Great job. Keep it up.
"Facebook is currently in the process of upgrading their infrastructure and handlers to 3.4 from 2" Why 3.4? Why not 3.6?
Most simple solutions are the best solutions.
Debian 9 only comes with Python 3 by default. On my laptop it's just Dropbox preventing me from removing it entirely.
Very novice programmer, but I would turn it into a list with .split() method, then use for loop to iterate through it.
I am working on a webscraper to download an image from a JavaScript-heavy website. The website makes a get request upon loading the image which I can see with the dev tools in the network panel. I will try out the proxy solution from [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36744627/network-capturing-with-selenium-phantomjs) SO post.
So what the hell has this got to do with Python?
As I said, why isn't there a big, red warning at the top stating **THIS IS EOL SO DON'T BOTHER** rather than something buried in a contents list several lines down?
Hey! I checked out the app and was considering contributing, but I'm VERY strongly opinionated about coding style, project structure, and model structure, and after looking at your code I'm afraid I might come off a tad too strong on changes to the project x_x how open are you guys to some well intentioned constructive criticism/game changing refactors?
Languages are just tools. You can have a favourite tool, but no carpenter is going to complain that he is being taught to use a screwdriver, when what he wants to do it use a hammer.
Overture
Watch some of their conference talks. It's loko but it works.
The ads organization uses AngularDart; it's probably used in other sites that they don't bother to mention.
Vs has pre and post build steps in your project build configuration. 
Your py3 installer is much nicer than mine. I had to switch to Conda when my environment got all jacked up. 
&gt; Well, if you're working in financial tech, that would actually be a reason to choose R. By that logic everybody would do what they did and buy Oracle, because of their superior sales and marketing, and not buy the vastly, technically superior Ingres, which I believe still, thankfully, lives on as postgresql.
Have they not heard of the [six module](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six)?
They don't put out bug fixes either, just wait for the new version of the OS to come out. Check out what's happening on their bug tracker, no chance? At least that used to be the case, or have they now got even worse? Over priced, over rated products from a highly over rated company that happens to be the most valued in the world. Please stop the planet, I want to get off :-(
Thanks for the response. What do you like about the book?
Tell your colleague to upgrade to a supported version of Python!
I just want to commend the responses in this thread. Most top responses just give bash/unix one-liners, and don't even mention Python at all. A Python version would be possible, and even quite short, but it's good to remember we have a toolbox, not just a multi-tool.
This is a perfectly good approach in many cases. Consider that you will need to store in memory the entire contents of the file, plus the entire list of lines (which depending on the language and split method may be larger or smaller than the original file). If memory is tight and the file is large, a better algorithm is to read the file line by line and free up the memory as you finish each line.
You should know at least one non-scripting, statically typed OOP language. Java and C# are fine OOP languages.
I take it that you missed this part "A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds" in PEP 8? As for project file and folder structures using your favourite search engine would have got plenty of answers, some of which have all ready been pointed out to you in other replies. 
Just get it done and leave it in the past.
As the other reply noted, this would require reading the whole file into memory. Thankfully, by default, using the idiomatic with open(file_name) as fh: for line in fh: #do something with line Only reads the file one line at a time. 
You're an upbeat person, fantastic, and all the best of luck to you
Yeah the wheel turns slowly enough that if you learn Python/Flask, you wont be left out in the cold. Shit, even learning Java/Spring won't put you in a bad spot, and that is losing to Python these days.
Very excited to read this. I'm just getting into blender and do a lot of Python for work. 
You should learn and be confident with a half dozen different languages to get used to different paradigms. You will be better able to solve problems in whichever language you are using. (But be careful not to drag in styles from one to the other...I'm looking at you python logging library.)
You're going to get good at Object Oriented Programming.
Can you use a command lien client to connect to your database? If not, I would resolve that issue first. Django DB configuration is usually pretty straightforward.
Focus on the fact that Java and the underlying JVM are capable of some really high performance, dynamic optimizations. Hope or try to make that an aspect of your Advanced class. Poke around in areas of the other languages (Clojure, Kotlin, Scala, even Jython) that compile down to Java bytecode and run on the JVM and you might find there are reasons for different languages and platforms to exist. Being able to see value in those and adapt to new ones that will be introduced in the future is what will make your future life interesting.
I like the idea, but have the following critiques: 1. HTTPS. There is no excuse for not using HTTPS in a world where [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) exists. 2. You *need* a designer. You took Bootstrap, kept the defaults for some components, and inexplicably chose to colors that make site look like a circus. I can't take you seriously if you can't even pick decent color scheme. 3. Make your search facets links that filter the results. 4. Show more than 5 results per page. 10 is typical. 5. Your login link/session store is broken. Clicking the login link on the homepage directed me to http://www.gitmeet.net/diego7319. I was also able to view that user's settings page. My attempt to change the email address, seems to have "fixed" something. As I said, you have a good idea, but you have a lot of basic things to fix if you want to gain some traction.
that's a really good advice, and I will definitely look into that. Thank you!
&gt; Python is considered a weakly-typed or dynamically-typed programming language. No it's not. Python is strongly typed and dynamically typed. They are not the same thing. &gt; The Global Interpreter Lock &gt; But my laptop has multiple cores, maybe I can put them to greater use by splitting the work. Like many people, you misunderstand the GIL. Python supports multiprocessing using the multiprocessing module. Threading is different than multiprocessing. You can very take advantage of your cores. The GIL is a thing, but you can release it with some C code and people do. &gt; Disorganized Build System C++ sure isn't better. Also, your numpy example is outdated. Numpy installs fine with pip now. &gt; Performance &gt; Python’s raw speed when it comes to performing a variety of computational tasks or I/O-bound tasks is not stellar as demonstrated by several standard-bearing benchmarks. On I/O bound tasks, Python is fine. I run an open source project, written entirely in Python. My benchmark problem is 2 GB. I can read the entire thing (it's a very complicated format) in 4 seconds. On the typical problem, the code runs at roughly the speed on your SSD/hard drive/network. It's fast enough. The problem is not Python is bad at reading/writing the file; it's that you're asking it to do too much. If you care about speed, use a binary format. Python is slow, but often not where you think. It's terrible at casting integers and floats from strings. It's bad with large nested for loops, but you should be using numpy for that. &gt; There are implementations such as PyPy that are fundamentally faster than the CPython reference implementation Depending on the problem. For heavy mathematical problems (so numpy/scipy), it's slower, and that's assuming it runs. &gt; The Great Schism: Python2 vs Python3 The "Great Schism" is gone. Most libraries support Python 2 and Python 3. People are migrating. &gt; Over time, the wider developer community has created tools like 2to3, 3to2 , and six — which were all well-intentioned gestures — to improve syntax compatibility across libraries, but were not perfect solutions as there is always some code that cannot be converted. Six is fine. The Python devs suggest not using 2to3 or 3to2. The suggest six, modernize, and futurize (is that the name?). &gt; Class abstractions are leaky in Python. And?
And tears everytime you type 'python' into terminal and it loads version 2. You can safely point that at python 3. Usually. Sometimes.
It's called the Raspberry Pi because of Python https://www.techspot.com/article/531-eben-upton-interview/ &gt; Pi is because originally we were going to produce a computer that could only really run Python. So the Pi in there is for Python. Now you can run Python on the Raspberry Pi but the design we ended up going with is much more capable than the original we thought of, so it's kind of outlived its name a little bit. 
There really isn't, as a user, that much more to know. I prefer dlib, everyone has their favourite..
I can see that being a not-so-great solution then. In our group, we basically pretended it was TV, no pausing allowed :p
That's really helpful. Thanks for taking the time to respond thoughtfully. I'm reading up on it now, and I think I'll probably buy it! I appreciate your help! 
I used to burn out a lot.. Regardless of work pressure.. if you can do 1 thing well to prevent burn out(like in Unix philosophy :)), try to get to bed at the same time and wake up at the same time. It will drastically improve your quality of sleep and reduce your chances of burnout..
instagram uses django btw. If you follow django's basic tutorial for a blog post its essentially the same functionalities of instagram, just make the 'post' of a blog a picture instead of text. Having said that, don't be fooled thinking a single person can do something like instagram as it stands today. What you are looking at now is over years with hundreds/thousands of people working on it and billions in investment. So... yeah, you could do a basic website and some of the same features though. heres the django blog post tutorial: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/tutorial01/
I'd bet they do use go.
Well this is relevant to my interests.
``` this is code ```
``` this is code ```
Seems like triple backticks dont really demarcate code blocks.. but a single line of code. If there is a line break, it just merges all the lines. so the only way to do line breaks as well as use triple backtics is to use tripple backticks for each line ``` line1 ``` ``` line2 ````
Thanks for pointing it out.. Yeah.. I am more familiar with stackoverflow and github style markdown.. I mixed things up here.. will polish it up.
Yeah. As I posted earlier, some markdown variants (gfm and pfm) do allow triple backticks for code blocks, but not reddit.
Why is that? I am using SQLAlchemy with Flask for a project I am working on, with Flask-Migrate it has been pretty easy to work with. What should I be looking out for?
Thanks for sharing your experience with Ansible. It does look very interesting, and in fact it is on the top of my list of candidates. The ability to easily deploy applications with it makes it that more interesting, as we can have both configuration managment platform and a deployment platform in one product. One could do the same with say Puppet, but I believe Ansible is more suitable for this. 
But most, if not all, languages have little things like this. One of the sources of confusion in most languages is operator precedence. Python isn't too bad here, but there are things like this: &gt;&gt;&gt; a = 1 &gt;&gt;&gt; b = 2 &gt;&gt;&gt; a, b == 1, 2 (1, False, 2) &gt;&gt;&gt; (a, b) == 1, 2 (False, 2) &gt;&gt;&gt; a, b == (1, 2) (1, False) &gt;&gt;&gt; (a, b) == (1, 2) True After seeing this a while ago I now *always* use `()` around a tuple, even it it's technically not part of the tuple.
client side framework, i think it's the most popular atm. 
Between Reddit and HackerNews, I've readily been enjoying the blogs posts you guys have been writing. :)
Except Blender now has a Bmesh module which makes creating mesh a much easier and understandable task. 
Nice article. The last line still stands, it's possible to use python inside blender but not the reverse.
this the future of CAD. it has many names: generative design, indirect CAD, code based design... there are many scripting languages/software to do this: 1. FreeCAD python 2. Blender Python 3. OpenSCAD 4. PostScript 5. Tikz/PGF, asymptote, pstricks 6. MetaPost 7. xml/svg 8. https://www.cairographics.org/ 9. Elmergrid .grd 10. Gmsh scripts .geo 11. OpenFOAM blockMeshDict 12. netgen scrips .in2d I personally do code based CAD because: 1. git 2. fully parametric design 3. object oriented CAD and I use FreeCAD because 1. opensource 2. cross-platform 3. backwards compatible 4. python 
I am far from an expert but when I get this problem I do print(type(line)) and it will print out the type of data in the variable. Then you can do str(line) or int(line) or something.. 
First r/learnpython should be were you post this. But I don't go there so: Second: You are looking for it in then if it isn't there return 0. Problem is your only do this once from what I can see so if it didn't find it in the first line it just returns. This is a good use case for else in for loops: with open(yourfile, 'r') as f: for line in f: if var in line: return 1 else: return 0 What this does is if it find the car it'll return 1, but if the for loop finishes without breaking then it'll return 0 This way you'll go through all lines in the file. Fyi, try not to name your file as 'file' as it is a built in. Use f or any other name but 'file' 
That's perfect! I've been trying to figure out a quick way yo determine type in Python. I am already forcing a string method on what I'm handing the function to make sure it isn't trying to check for an object amongst a string array or something silly like that.
Probably still some issues with 3.6 
Let's walk through this: def check(var): Good so far... with open(file.txt) as file: Alright, so this should fail because file.txt in quotes, but my guess is you just skipped those by accident. And you're shadowing the **file** builtin, which isn't ideal, but will work... for lines in file: Ok, so **lines** is a bit of a weird variable name here, because when iterating over the object that's been set to **file**, you're getting each *individual* line in turn ... so I'm thinking maybe you think you're looking at the entire content of the file? But I'm not sure ... right now **lines** is the first line of your file. if var in lines: return 1 else: return 0 ... which means that, since you return here in both cases, what you've written is "check if var is in the first line of file.txt; if it is, return 1, otherwise return 0". Computers always do exactly what you've told them to do. Try: def check(string): with open("file.txt") as f: return string in f.read() Or, if you don't want the entire file in memory at once: def check(string): with open("file.txt") as f: for line in f: if string in line: return True return False And you should get there. 
Freecad with Python is brilliant!
Just do def check(var): with open(file.txt) as file: return var in file.read() read() returns all the characters in the file. No need to loop over the lines. 
It's hard to know where you are going wrong without seeing some code. It seems that all of the processing is being done within one script? When writing a crawler like this, it's generally advised to seperate out I/O bound and CPU bound tasks. Basically having a dumb scraper which pushes the responses to a NOSql database, allows you to have another process simply parsing the HTML and extracting your data. What you are saying highly suggests something is wrong or inefficient in the architecture or structure of the code. 
if I could encourage more people to get in! 
That's kinda funky. From all of my years of programming across several languages, that looks so odd. But for all the glory of programming: *it doesn't matter how it looks as long as it works.* 
That gets a wee bit nuanced, and has some behavior you should be aware of. The **for** and **while** loops do indeed allow for an **else** condition, *but* the **else** only fires if no **break** statement was ever encountered in the loop. In what I'm assuming is your current loop, you're returning from the loop it **var** is found, and doing nothing otherwise inside the loop, which means that you'll always get to the **else** of **var** isn't found: def check(var): for line in lines: if var in line: return True else: return False And that works very much like this: def check(var): for line in lines: if var in line: return True return False But with one subtle difference: if you had some logic that did a **break**, the **else** world never fire. So, let's say -- totally arbitrarily -- that you wanted to do the same check, but for some reason you wanted to only go as far as the first line that ended with an exclamation point. def check(var): for line in lines: if var in line: return True if line.endswith('!'): break else: return False This function would return True if **var** was in any line up to and including the first that ended in an exclamation point, False if **var** was in no line *AND* no line ended in an exclamation point, and None of **var** either was or was not in the file, but if it were it came after a line that ended with an exclamation point. Suddenly you've built a check that has tree possible end states, not the two you'd expect. While this: def check(var): for line in lines: if var in line: return True if line.endswith('!'): break return False Always returns True if **var** is in the file up to the first line ending in an exclamation point, and False in all other situations. This subtlety is why you rarely see for/else and while/else being used... it's very valuable in code in which you explicitly want a different response to a **break** than to other means of exiting the loop, but prone to bugs if used without care.
Tried again without --enable-optimization and now I still have the same problems :c
&gt; It is great for small, quick-and-dirty programs that perform single-threaded, sequential tasks. Python has its flaws, but that ain't one of them. Unfortunately, the wide spread of the Python language in many computing fields shows a different story than yours. /u/billsil gave you some good point to refresh your knowledge of the language.
I am very curious and honestly i want to see your proposed changes. Feel free to open a pull request. We are always open on criticism in a good manner 
See you on github Geofry , waiting for your commits
Interesting sources, I will study and turn them into nodes.
Have you heard of Blender parametric feamework called Sverchok? Can add it also to the list. 
Python 3 has lazy evaluations on iterables, this library extends it to sequences (index based access). Once your pipeline is defined, you directly access an item in the middle of the sequence, and in the middle of the pipeline, whereas you can't with nested `map` in pure python: tmp1 = lproc.rmap(f1, arr) tmp2 = lproc.rmap(f2, tmp1) res = lproc.rmap(f3, tmp2) print(res[2]) # request output for a single value &gt; 252.5 print(tmp1[2]) # probe a single value &gt; 3

What the holy hell is a "noone"? But, seriously, I see lots of problems, and you're right ... ultimately though I'm not sure how we go back, find Charles Babbage, tell him to just keep that shit to himself, and then toddle off to France to kill Jacquard before he gets his look running. All human enterprises are about compromise built atop compromise built atop compromise. The only way to get any work done is to harness and improve the compromises that have come before. And that's because even the simplest systems you could possibly work with are just abstractions of a shit ton of similar compromises. Or, I suppose, we could just rewrite it all in Rust.
but is it code based or GUI? there is also [antimony](https://github.com/mkeeter/antimony/blob/develop/README.md)

Is Rust really so great or you are just ironic?
Rust is pretty great, if what you were doing was thinking about rewriting most of the stuff that's currently written in C in such a manner that you'd eliminate all the memory access bugs that plague programming like a damned STI... but if what you're writing isn't low level memory access, or is already very tolerant of those sorts of faults, then it's just another language with some very good ideas, and no doubt some bad ones baked in. You seem to be under the impression that humanity has evolved much further than it has, in fact, done... we didn't even figure out automated testing until WELL after we'd written enormous untestable structures into projects we now all implicitly rely on but can't fathom. We've spent uncountable human hours of effort on the house of cards you're talking about, and **no one** is going to go back and rewrite it all. So yeah, it's great, but the notion of rewriting everything in it has almost become a meme to describe how people who love shiny new hammers think it's a good idea to unpry every nail ever driven BEFORE whacking in the replacement.
Dude, just how high are you right now?
It's a scale thing ... you don't need fake users once their activity drives real users to your site... basically if you're ever in the situation where you need to scale up your fraud, then you've kind of misunderstood your calling.
Do i understand you correctly that there are essential problems in computing that have been ignored and worked around using leaky abstractions? Could you give an example of one of these problems? Maybe we can start a useful discussion about how to solve these "at the root".

typing.NamedTuple doesn't seem to be a type but an instance of typing.NamedTupleMeta in Python 3.6: &gt;&gt;&gt; type(C) &lt;class 'type'&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; type(typing.NamedTuple) &lt;class 'typing.NamedTupleMeta'&gt; And in Python 3.5 it's a function: &gt;&gt;&gt; type(typing.NamedTuple) &lt;class 'function'&gt; 
Uh
Why would I use this over plain old mocks?

what kind of automation this is? what should I google for? 
Whitepace in the examples is a mess: needs more spaces after commas, less spaces near keyword arguments etc.
I'd say it was a bug as from [typing module docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html):- &lt;quote&gt; class typing.NamedTuple Typed version of namedtuple. Usage: class Employee(NamedTuple): name: str id: int This is equivalent to: Employee = collections.namedtuple('Employee', ['name', 'id']) &lt;/quote&gt; I've checked the bug tracker and didn't spot anything obviously like it so it should be raised, if only to get the docs clarified. 
Sverchok is node based visual programming, parametric, the idea came from Grasshopper from Rhino, but as non programmer, I found the idea of list inside list or nestedness interesting. Very Pythonic.
Switch to decaf.
I've been waiting for a "Python Design Patterns 2" talk for a long time. This site is a nice alternative.
It is easy to mimic this type of behavior, but it is very, very hard to do it in a way that Google will be fooled. I wouldn't bother if I were you.
I too miss haml. Wish I could be of more help but the python community doesn’t seem to appreciate it. 
Not really, `locals()` is a bit smelly: it is implicitly dumping everything in scope into a dict and you'd have to check the whole function to find out what is in there (easy to mess up). In python we want to be explicit: @decorator def foo(): x = 'bar' return {'x': x} Or @decorator def foo(): x = 'bar' return dict(x=x)
Check out Pyjade - https://github.com/syrusakbary/pyjade There are subtle differences, but like haml it uses indentation instead of open/close tags.
django has [django-hamlpy](https://github.com/nyaruka/django-hamlpy) which is based on [HamlPy](https://github.com/jessemiller/HamlPy).
Yeah that title is very uninformative.
&gt; And you're shadowing the file builtin, which isn't ideal, but will work `file` was removed as a built-in in 3.0
Do you have prior programming language experience? I mean a real programming language, even if it's non-trivial programming in Visual Basic—ugh. P.S. In general, in English, only the first word, proper nouns, and acronyms are capitalized.
It's called Wen Automation, and I'd start with looking up Selenium.
Seems like somebody just got jilted.
My guess is that the phone version is still using web tech for almost any application that's less resource intensive than a game, music, multimedia, or an app using APIs not available to web. Kivy is an option if you need the full range of APIs. The base of Kivy is python for Android and it would provide you an option for a webview with Flask as a server: https://blog.kivy.org/2016/05/android-apps-with-python-flask-and-a-webview/
Yeah pep8 is your friend op
Chances are it will be too difficult to get a library that complex working on a version of Python that none of the authors are attempting to support. A lot changed after Python 3.3
Haha - rust - ironic. I get it.
You are right. But the cost and time to write a new library from scratch make it inviable. 
Be minded that it loads all file content into memory, while iterating over lines is lazy loading.
What was it about?
If I got it right, NamedTuple is code generator, and not regular subclassing. Since it is pure python (and should be relatively short) you can review it yourself. 
Yes, you can see it when you turn on your computer, when you turn on your browser, when you send an email... the matrix is everywhere :) For a starter, we could have just one way of communication between networks. A simple one, easy to understand, and well documented, with great tutorials and examples, that even kids would understand. I never said it will be easy, but it will never happen if no one talks about this right? I am not an expert, i am bad programmer, but i can clearly see that a lot of things are wrong. All starts in our minds, so there must be a start somewhere. I ignore all the voices telling me to shut up, they are slaves to their egos.
yeah it reminded me of grasshopper the moment i saw it. grasshopper and other visual programming interfaces alike are great but at some point you realise that they are limiting. indirect CAD is for sure very unintuitive but in the long run it will pay off. just ask any mechanical engineer sho has to work on a CAD assembly designed by someone else. it is a nightmare.
I could put up a screenshot. Have you tried running the example? Shouldn't take more than 5 mins.
&gt; For a starter, we could have just one way of communication between networks. A simple one, easy to understand, and well documented, with great tutorials and examples, that even kids would understand. Relevant: https://xkcd.com/927/
 Unfortunately I'm just on my phone at the moment. If you can submit a screenshot as a pull request that would be appreciated. The screenshot should probably belong below the "complicated.md" and have it have a picture of the portion of the form that has a matplotlib plot with sliders.
&gt; have just one way of communication between networks We do. Depending on whether you are talking about communication between different IP-based networks(subnets) or between networks using different protocols (for example ethernet and CAN-Bus) this is either routing or protocol translation.
That's basically machine learning workflows.
Nice! I still think making it through shapes is easier.
I'd use it more if it was more stable. 
Postscript? What kind of madness must it take to code Postscript for CAD?

Thank You
Thanks! I appreciate it, also mobile so can't sit down and run it yet. Will look into this deeper, as currently wrangling pyqt5 to realise a remote UI over ZMQ. 
Metaclassing is weird. Subclassing is OK.
Holy shit, upvoted and bookmarked! Maybe I can finally learn to do Python!
Compromises like the ‘six’ library?
https://github.com/nboughton/stalotto It's written for Linux users but it'll scrape all the historical data and deposit it in a sqlite db.
If you need to support version 2, six would be acceptable. But if you don't, I see no reason to complicate your code with yet another dependency and version specific branch statements. Does it still have `if isinstance(x, six.whatever_type)` everywhere?
A lot of people forget that C (and Rust) are already high-level languages, they're just high-level languages with no runtime and an emphasis on direct memory management. Python is a *higher* level language, without good constructs for manual memory management.
Start here [Porting Python 2 Code to Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html).
&gt; Sometimes you need to create a commit with particular timestamp. When? Why? Worrying about commit timestamp seems to be "sweating the details".
Lynda has a good course by Simon Allardice, I think it's called foundations of programming, and it uses python. Really good resource!
&gt; But they're needing the current month to be at the end of the csv file and the preceding months before it in order so they can see the line graph properly Instructions unclear. Are you saying you need the entries sorted by descending date, or is the last line somehow different? [You can parse the date with `strptime` in the the `time` module.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html?highlight=strptime#time.strptime)
Yeah.... Worng place to post. :) Tank You!
Books! Books are great for revision and reference. They can be verbose or concise. You choose [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse) 
Many possible use cases, depending on your workflow: https://gist.github.com/ythecombinator/7e70d7baea74305c93e6 http://eddmann.com/posts/changing-the-timestamp-of-a-previous-git-commit/ https://alexpeattie.com/blog/working-with-dates-in-git
710 :)
I found the best way to learn the basics was reading books. I find it easier to learn from a book than a screen. That's just me though. Automate the boring stuff or Python crash course are good for starters !!!
If this month were January 2018, that needs to be last. The first month on the csv would be February 2017 then March 2017, all the way through to January 2018.
The shell script `build_pex.sh` in this project is literally more bytes of active command line than a shell script that does the same thing as this entire project. I mean, cool project and all, but essentially enterprise level programming.
This would be better at r/learnpython, but in the first one you are modifying the list in place, and the function can read the global variable and mutate it. In the second you are assigning to a variable named `mylist` which you have not declared to be global, therefore a new variable is created that has the scope of that function and it does not modify the global one, it masks it.
When you are not an expert and you think all the experts are wrong, you've got to question whether you really understand the problem.
I like C. I *don't* miss C. If you're going for no runtime, no auto-mem management, Rust really does just in every way feel like what C would look like if you wrote it 30 years later after seeing things like Heartbleed in the wild. It's too easy to -- literally -- kill people in C.
"my first program"? 
I ment for free
Thank You!
Thank You!
You should add a note at the bottom about `collections.Counter`. First teach them the theory of how to do it, then show them how it would be done in real code.
This would be described in technical language as "sort the dates in ascending numerical order" from time import mktime, strptime sorted(mktime(strptime(date, '%B %Y'))) I advise that you check the format string (%B %Y) as I did it from memory.
I used codeacademy free online course with python built into the website. Very very good! 
This one? All I could find after some searching. https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/184oj7/pycon_2012_stop_writing_classes/
To bad. I was hoping for a view of the repo with a slider that let you go forward or back in time, seeing changes to the files or to particular files as you move the slider. That would be very useful. Anyone know of such a tool?
First look for the basics of the language(goole is a good friend) the strength and weakness. Then choose a skill to learn(Image Processing, Machine Learning, Web dev, Web Scrapping, game dev, etc) then look for info on that skill written in python.
I'm hardpressed to think of any reason why one could reasonably suggest to never use classes. That's like saying never use a hammer--why not? It's not inherently a bad thing, it's just a design practice. What reasoning could someone have to suggest to never use classes? That kind of just contributes to the stereotype of Python being a messy language also.

If you write a class with one method that does all the work. Write a function. If you have three functions all sharing a global dict, write a class. 
Sorry, I didn't knew about this. A user posted code about this function (in the comments) but it didn't work as expected. Are you sure that Counter do the same what I wanted to do in the post ?
Because Bash 4 is GPLv3
Thanks. I will do this in the future.
So how can re-arrange the csv based off of the current month?
Glad to hear it might be able to be of help :)
I didn't miss your sentence, you missed mine, because I explained to you where your credibility went.
I had a similar problem recently, and ended up using the solution in Section 10.8 in the Python Cookbook, which suggested import pkgutil data = pkgutil.get_data(__package__, path) which takes care of a lot of the logic and edge cases automatically.
Have to create a script to match Customer Account Names from two different reports. (Sales Report vs Internal Account Names) There is no standard naming convention so have to rely on Fuzzy matching here. Currently started with fuzzywuzzy library - its pretty straightforward to use but the results are not very accurate. Need to refine the data some how and then keep trying. 
Ill try it :)
I wana learn Python from start to finish.
There’s also some good explanatory codes out there, a good starting one is to google a pong game python code, I found one previously that goes into detail why they wrote what they wrote and what each function is actively doing. Google is your friend here, but definitely codeacademy for getting into the nut and bolts of the language 
Here's another fun way. &gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(A, A) True &gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(B, B) True &gt;&gt;&gt; A is B False &gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(A, B) True &gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(B, A) True What are A and B?
That's because `+=` is implemented by calling `__iadd__` and thus mutates the argument, it's not exactly the same as `=...+` which does an addition and then an assignment
Thanks.
Just for anyone following up, I ended up doing: `yum install python36 python36-devel python36-tools` which used the EPEL repo Then to create the virtualenv: `python36 -m venv ~/virt/projectdir` to create the virtual environment. I used `2to3` as I wasn't looking to main 2.7 comparability, now I'm going through the dependencies removing `backports`, `futures`, etc.
Is there an example of this happening you can share?
Much has been said on why global variables are bad. Instead of adding to that, it's better for you to read this thread [topic](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/148108/why-is-global-state-so-evil).
I believe tweepy is the standard most popular. I use it in my projects for some time. Recently I switch to twitterapi for the more simpler syntax and it is up to date.
Ahahah thank you for posting that question. I was reading the same thing and I felt stupid asking what is the use case for that. I can't think of one. 
encapsulation either students is a member of the module and module-level functions can manipulate it, or it's a member of a class and class methods can manipulate it.
Intellij version control history diff tool is quite cool, but there is no slider :(
Yes, this.
Nice!
That's fun (I had to really think about it too!). The one case I could think of is A=type and B=object (or vice-versa). 
This class is dependent on a global variable, and if the class was being used in a different module this won't be apparent. If you created two instances of this class, the two instances could interfere with one another. Unless you intend otherwise, in which case the students [] is like a shared database. Also , Python is not multi-threaded, but in a multi-threaded system (like C++) this object design would be buggy.
Python has modules for namespacing and module level variables and has good data structures like tuples and dataframes if that's what you need. It's not saying "never use a hammer", but rather telling people not to use a hammer to push a button. 
I don't want to sound too condescending here, but I have a very good sense for what you're expressing -- it's exactly how I used to think. All I'd like to suggest is that learning a bit more about functional programming (from a language like Haskell) could at least give you some different perspective on solving problems in Python.
You can buy used books...they are less expensive than your lunch! Your mon/father will gladly help, I'm sure! 
&gt; I'm hardpressed to think of any reason why one could reasonably suggest to never use classes. I apologize if that's what I insinuated; the point of the video is that classes shouldn't *necessarily* be your entry point to every problem. You shouldn't NEVER use classes any more than you should ALWAYS do.
That's the one. I don't agree with everything he says, but there are some good points in it.
Yeah, you can set this up yourself with metaclasses but type and object are the inbuilt pair I was thinking of
This sounds like a remote debugger could be useful. I used [winpdb](http://winpdb.org) in the past. However it appears to not be maintained anymore.
I was indifferent until you posted this. &gt; Maybe even if I knew about Counter, I would not have included it because this task can be accomplished in a more basic way (even if this could be more or less wrong) &gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import Counter &gt;&gt;&gt; c = Counter([m for m in 'Hello are you there']) &gt;&gt;&gt; c Counter({'e': 4, ' ': 3, 'l': 2, 'o': 2, 'r': 2, 'H': 1, 'a': 1, 'y': 1, 'u': 1, 't': 1, 'h': 1}) &gt;&gt;&gt; c.most_common(1) [('e', 4)] &gt; P.S about the job interview, trust me, they ask you to do things that you can't even immagine. You have to know how to do it both ways. Yourself, and using the standard library collections.
I think tradingview might be useful 
There was a moment in the late 80's and early 90's where PostScript was pretty much everywhere, and was the de-facto way to do high quality graphics stuff. NeXT integrated it into the display system, it was in printers. It made a certain amount of sense to try and stuff it in everything, and because it was fairly common and growing more common, it seemed like a useful skill to program it by hand.
A Counter will take any iterable so:- &gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import Counter &gt;&gt;&gt; c = Counter('Hello are you there') &gt;&gt;&gt; c Counter({'e': 4, ' ': 3, 'l': 2, 'o': 2, 'r': 2, 'H': 1, 'a': 1, 'y': 1, 'u': 1, 't': 1, 'h': 1}) &gt;&gt;&gt; 
... Bet your a treat at a BBQ... And a hypocrit. Thanks though.
I used to do the same, but then I realized how modules and classes make the code so easy to modify, upgrade, and maintain. Its gonna be impossible the way it is now lol
Because I like them? It was just the first thing I thought of, would be neater like you have
The former yes, the latter no, as having started work in the electrical engineering industry in 1974 before moving into electronics and then computing I've learned rather a lot. Over and out.
This is a reasonable heuristic rule but the real reason for classes is to define your own types. A Type is value and semantics, and classes allow you to tie all that up in a single name. This leads to much clearer code. That nonsense about don't use classes comes from the same places that say don't use inheritance or don't use OOP. It's mostly over generalized advice but it helps to know what alternatives exist.
if you're authenticating, you can use auth_client = gdax.AuthenticatedClient(key, b64secret, passphrase) auth_client.get_product_ticker(product_id='BTC-USD') not sure if unauthenticated works the same.
You already got the answer, but one other thing you did wrong is to post this in "r/python" when the right place to ask questions is " r/learnpython ", as it says on the right of your screen in bold letters...
Perfect. I'll have a look. Just lloking for the concept or idea behind it all. Once I have that, then I can do my own thing for our projects. Thanks again.
kgb and mocks actually work pretty well together. We're not aiming to replace a mocking framework, but rather trying to solve the spying part in a way that's cumbersome with mocks. There's things kgb can do that mocks can't. With a mock, you're replacing a top-level function or a method on a class with something that looks/acts like the function/method but is under your control, potentially overriding behavior and tracking state. You can do this with the mock package under Python 2 or `unittest.mock` on Python 3. The problem is that patching functions isn't always straight-forward, depending on what else has imported the function. When a module does an import, it's creating an entry in its local `__dict__` for each of the things it imports, creating its own references to functions. Say you have `module_a.py` and `module_b.py`, each doing: from urllib.request import urlopen `module_a.__dict__` and `module_b.__dict__` now looks like `{ ..., 'urlopen': &lt;function urlopen at ...&gt;, ...}`. Replacing `module_a.urlopen` won't impact `module_b.urlopen`. They're separate. If this code is outside your control (third-party package, perhaps), your tests could be sensitive to this. When patching `urlopen`, your tests would have to know which modules imported it and try to patch each of those specific dictionaries (at least the ones that could result in a call during your test run). It can't just patch `urllib.request.urlopen`, since the modules have their own variables pointing to `urlopen` references at this point. See Python 3's [Where to patch](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/unittest.mock.html#where-to-patch) docs for their take on how to get around all this. It's often doable, but annoying, and your tests are susceptible to changes in those modules. If the import is occurring within a function or some other namespace you can't get to, then you may be out of luck. For instance: def my_function(): from urllib.request import urlopen urlopen(...) If that's imported during your test run, great, you can patch `urllib.request.urlopen`. If it's imported before, you might be out of luck. kgb takes a different approach. We don't care where functions are imported from or into. We don't try to replace them with an object that *looks* like a function. We keep the function there, intact. What we do is replace the underlying bytecode of the function (`function.__code__`) with that of a dynamically-generated proxy function that can record all calls and optionally forward on to the original or a custom function. Because we're modifying the *original* function's bytecode, anything that's imported the function already will get the new behavior, and can be tracked. This means stable, predictable unit tests, not affected by code reorganization in modules you may not have control over. It means your functions and methods are still functions and methods -- code that introspects your functions won't see anything out of the ordinary. They'll see the same docs, the same default arguments, the same function signature. It means greater control -- you can spy on an unbound method on a class up-front and then track calls to future calls to the bound methods from instances of the class. You can also spy on methods on instances that are otherwise not easily mutable. And it's also stable (don't let the bytecode replacement scare you). We've been using kgb for years in very large codebases with over 10,000 unit tests in total, for a range of Python versions.
Kudos grammar nazi... With that level of detail, I bet you could actually help with some tips, apart from the obvious Oxford dictionary. So, how about we try that next time?
Adding to the other good comments: * In my opinion it's all about readability, which is what most of the other comments have implied too. Just from looking at the `Student` class, it's not at all clear where the `students` variable comes from, who else has access to it, and so on. And the other way around too: from seeing the `students` variable, you can't tell who uses it. * You can actually get an error by changing the code just slightly: students = [] class Student: def add_student(self, name, student=332): student = {"name": name, "student_id": student_id} students += [student] # instead of `append` student = Student() student.add_student("Mark") Results in: UnboundLocalError: local variable 'students' referenced before assignment * Let me show a better way to achieve the same thing. Later on in the video the code evolves to: students = [] class Student: def __init__(self, name, student_id=332): self.name = name self.student_id = student_id students.append(self) Still mutating global state. A better way would be: class Student: students = [] def __init__(self, name, student_id=332): self.name = name self.student_id = student_id Student.students.append(self) This makes `students` a class attribute of `Student`, neatly indicating who will be using it. There are [even more advanced ways](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12101958/how-to-keep-track-of-class-instances). 
I have nothing to add to my posts. If they are not useful then ignore them. I am not interested to give more feedback on the program.
Also sidewalk is one word.
Great reply thanks!
Great reply thanks!
These youngsters...
If your program has no parallelism (multithreading, multiprocessing), using a global data frame might be OK (for small, quick, low-maintenance programs). If you want parallel processing, then you'll need to use a producer-consumer type of pattern with Queues. If the datasets are huge (i.e. won't fit in memory), then storing to a .csv might be appropriate as would reading back the data in small chunks. What are you optimizing for?
And recognizing when you're just hammering a nail, and when you're building an entire house.
There are lots and lots of blogposts on the internet on how to deal with git timestamps: &gt; My country is under a daylight saving time period and not all my commits are made during the morning/afternoon. Because I commited after 11:00 PM - which, given the local DST, was after 00:00 AM - my 100+ days commit streak got broken - which made me very unhappy. https://gist.github.com/ythecombinator/7e70d7baea74305c93e6 --- Another one: &gt; A tendency I have picked up is to be very commit happy when developing locally, and then find myself rebasing a lot before pushing to a remote. As a result of this I sometimes am required to alter timestamps of certain commits to make them more meaningful. I found that the simplest of which is adding a specified timestamp to the current commit. http://eddmann.com/posts/changing-the-timestamp-of-a-previous-git-commit/ --- &gt; Sometimes you make a mistake when committing to Git. You’ve either committed the changes with the wrong author tag or at the wrong time. For example, you do a bunch of work and then forget to commit before going on holiday. If you commit when you get back, and if you’re a pendant, you might want to change the dates to when you actually did the work. https://swoogan.blogspot.com/2015/06/changing-date-on-series-of-git-commits.html --- I needed some changes from another branch so that I could work on top of those. (I don’t know why I didn’t think of branching off that branch, but whatever.) So I cherry-picked them, but realised, as we all hate – the commits appear as the most recent, but the timestamps have the original date. http://hey.georgie.nu/git-change-date/ --- &gt; Recently on a side project I’ve been working on I decided that I wanted to create a repository… 2 weeks later. This was because initially I felt I didn’t have much code to begin with, no point keeping a version control of code that hasn’t been written yet.. right? https://leewc.com/articles/making-past-git-commits/ --- Or if you're tend to procrastinate a bit :) &gt; What happens if you’re lazy (like me), and happen to only make that final commit way past your boss’s deadline? https://garysferrao.github.io/git/commit/date/2015/12/01/change-git-commit-date.html --- I didn't include StackOverflow threads with discussions on the same topic. However, they are easily searchable. I found that common solution to modify GIT_AUTHOR_DATE and GIT_COMMITER_DATE is cumbersome and not reliable because often you want to set these timestamps to be the same and have to modify both. So I just composed a tool that provides more simpler interface to git built in functionality - to modify those time stamps. I believe some folks may find in useful. I personally find it useful.

Well, at least the creator posted it here and reads the feedback, presumably applying it to future videos.
Thank you /u/Konchshell.. yeah.. thats what I meant. Thanks for pointing me to the tutorial. I will go through it. I have use a lot of libraries (`openpyxl`, `xlwings`, `pyautogui`, `pywin32` etc etc), I never had a problem with importing any libraries, or any modules in these libraries. So far the code has been restricted in single files, and each file (`module`) would do its own thing, without interacting with other modules (written by me). I do have to run all the modules, one by one serially. A few weeks back when I did the integration of these modules, I did try to figure out how to import the modules using relative imports but faced some problems and was in a time pressure. So I took a shortcut and so instead of figuring out the right way to do imports, I essentially ran each of the modules sequentially by running it through `os.system` os.system("python module1.py") os.system("python module2.py") etc etc. This worked fine, but now I have some more time. So I am writing out the tests, and cleaning them up. Heres a highly simplified version of my project so far for replicating the problem: package1 tests __init__.py test_module1 test_func1 subpackage1 __init__.py module1 func1 To test the function `func1` in `test_func1`, I thought it would be best to do a `relative-import` of `module1` and just call `module1.func1` at the time of running the test. The absolute path of `Class1`, `Class1.func1` could change, but as long as I keep the _tests_ folder in a similar relative location, any problems because of file paths would be minimized. So in `tests_module1`, I put this at the top of the file from .. import subpackage1.module1 as m1 Then in `test_func1`, I directly attempted to call `func1`, using `m1.func1()` after setting up the appropriate variables so `func1` can run. I run this with the `cwd` set to `tests/`, so assuming the same convention as navigating linux file systems, I would expect that `from ..` signifies a location where the `cwd` is set to `subpackage1`. So `from .. import subpackage1` would import `subpackage1` located under `package1`. However, that didnt work. I have also tried other variations, to get relative imports to work while located under the `tests/` directory in the `ipython` command line (or running `%run test_module1.py` while located under the `tests/` directory: from ... import package1.module1 import Class1 as Cl1 from .. import package1 from ..package1 import module1 from . import test_module1 None of this worked. I also tried to replicated the example in PEP328, I wasnt able to find a solution: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/7w1vsp/does_relative_imports_work_as_per_pep328_in/ Absolute imports do work. So when located under the `package1` directory,the following these will work: import subpackage1 import subpackage1.module1 Do you have any insight as to what I am doing wrong?
Yep yep. I like simple guidelines though, cuts through the complexities. I could say a functions is an encapsulation of code, while a class is encapsulation of data. And that might make more sense to some people, but the truth is you dont REALLY get classes until you get yourself deep, and head first into some complex abstraction of code, like an MVC or an ECS system.
Wondering what you are hoping to do with the scraped data? Run some ML algo to figure out whether there are any correlations between keywords and price spikes, so as to know when to buy or sell?
I use classes for 3 things when writing large (10k LoC or more) programs. The first use is to encapsulate a module of the program. This is not the same as a Python module. It's more like your typical "service" architecture in other languages. If I have, say, a need for an object that watches a log file, I will write a class to encapsulate that information. The second use for a class is to model a domain object. There are two ways to go about this. The first is an anemic model. An anemic model consists of domain objects with NO associated behavior. They simply contain data (think: namedtuple). The other way to do this is a rich model, where a class contains both data AND associated behavior. The choice between the two depends on how much logic you want to give to the SERVICE operating on the model. Anemic = more service logic, Rich = less service logic. Again, choose wisely and for your specific use case (data processing tends to favor anemic, it seems). The third use is for GUIs. This is where I would make GREAT use of inheritance like I would no where else. I primarily write GUIs in PyQt where inheriting a GUI widget to add some functionality or tweak initialization is an absolute must. When building GUIs from smaller elements, I will compose them in a container widget instead. Classes ARE NOT bad. They have specific uses. I would contend that you should NOT use classes for things that are singleton in nature. Often, a service MIGHT be singleton at the start of development, so you favor using a module and module globals. But I've found that as development creeps along, I want that service as a class, so I can instance it, and even inherit it and override it. Hope this rant helps...
So, a `Student` doesn't represent a Student? You can *add* a student to a `Student`? And the list of students is in global state? What kind of OOP is this 🤦
 Thanks for the pointers. I checked out the book and youtube channel. I found the DrapsTV and the book you suggested very helpful, because it directly addressed some of the problems I am having in building my system (Networking/imports). I am also learning in a similar fashion, using edX course (Intro to Computer Science from MIT) https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-11 and a few books `Code Complete2`, `Clean Code` and `Introduction to Computer Science` recommended by the course. The book lays a great foundation for understanding computerscience, but sometimes can be a little lacking in actual implementation in Python. 
Yeah my experience with Python is limited to mostly some general purpose scripting. I've built one 'full blown' application with it for reading blockchain hex dumps but that's the biggest cohesive project I've done. My in-depth experience is with PHP so I tend to extrapolate based on my PHP knowledge. I tend to just code in Python like I do in PHP but I do have some functional experience with languages like JS and I know some things like list comprehensions, lambdas, currying, etc but you don't see that a lot in PHP, even though it exists to a degree. It's fun to do compared to boring PHP but I also feel slightly dirty sometimes.
i'm surprised more people who need to use python ecosystem don't reach for hy lang more often
Great reply thanks!
The data sets are pretty small - not more than a couple thousand records. This is an academic research project, so the focus is more on using this program to demonstrate the results of some method rather than the performance of the software. I just figured that in case this project grows or if I work on bigger projects in the future it would be useful to understand paradigms that are scalable. 
If I'm routinely performing the same analysis with different input parameters, I often make a class: class Analyze: __init__(self, a, b, c): self.input_params = [a, b, c] self.data = self.load_data(a, b, c) def load_data(self): # self.load_data could be loading data from file or generating it, returning a dataframe def plot(self): fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.plot('a', 'b', data=self.data) fig.savefig('{}'.format('_'.join(self.input_params)) analysis1 = Analyze(1,2,3) analysis1.plot() analysis2 = Analyze(1,3,2) analysis2.plot() Ultimately it depends on the scope and extent of what you're trying to do. If it's an ad hoc analysis then it's probably not worthwhile going to such lengths, but if it's something you perform frequently then it can be worth organizing more concretely. 
I'm not sure I catch your drift. Multiple inheritance was probably a pretty random example but it was a relevant one for me recently when I had a bunch of code already written (lots of controllers) and needed to add a way to make a method available to all controllers. i didnt want to muddy up the immediate parent class so I wanted to create a new sibling for the parent class that the other classes would all inherit from and receive a new method. But this meant that I would need to make that the parent of the parent class and wasn't sure what kind of side effects that might have since it was already extending another class. Traits exist in PHP to forego this but I've never tried them so I figured I'd wait until a little bit later to read more into traits and settled by dirtying up the main parent class (i.e. MyController extends Controller which extends BaseController--one big chain) OOP is a big deal in PHP since that's the only way you can write tolerable code ;(
Oddly enough, I develop in Notepad++ and test functionality in IDLE. I'm not a big fan of bloated IDEs. I've heard good things about Virtual Studio Code, though. Might try that out.
When I mentioned twitter, this was a while ago when I was tracking hashtags, and creating a timeline from news sources. So if a big event occurred and a hashtag blew up, it would create a timeline sort of like reddit live of only a list of approved twitter handles. currently scraping data is for the website i am building for a personal project. its already posted here so I won't link it again. I think there is a pyfinance subreddit that you might be more interested in for that sort of stuff.
That was a *really* good explanation. I have spent years scripting things that got bigger than intended without once considering I could consolidate all those values into an instance of a class that has setters and getters. Thanks. 
There's a couple of ways you could organize the program. I would recommend not thinking about each file as a "script" but rather a set of functions with input and output, and then a master controller function in the main script that looks like: def main(): data_frame = pandas.DataFrame() populated_frame = populate_frame(dataframe) simulated_frame = simulate(populated_frame) plot_data_frame(simulated_frame) I'm simplifying here. But what I'm suggesting is perhaps these top level functions take the whole dataframe, but any functions use use to do the work internally should only take that data which they are operating on and be unaware of any else. Just keep in mind the idea that functions should only consume the data they need to operate and you can break the program down in a scalable way. 
[ipdb|https://www.safaribooksonline.com/blog/2014/11/18/intro-python-debugger/] is a pretty light debugger. I hear ya on bloat.
Looks like you forgot the main reason underneath the wide and growing adoption of Python: productivity. The extra effort one spend in writing a large test coverage is usually lower than time saved thanks to dynamic and concise essence of the language, so it pay out... not mentioning that unit tests also checks the behaviour, not only the type compliance. Furthermore, I feel strange reading these critics in SOA, and much more in modern microservice dockered architecture. On classical monolithic applications deployed on though application servers, millions of lines of code compiled and packed together, things like forced encapsulation, static pedant typingz efficient threading and zipped single-file artifacts are still worthy, of course, and in thay context I could still advise you Java or C#. But no, not on microservice architecture. Here you scale dinamically with multiple instances, not statucally with multiple cores. Here your move around cached layered images, so doesen't matter if one of the inner layer is big. Here you have many small project, easily guaranteed even with just gray box tests, typing is really the least problem. Here you could easily reimplement the single critical performance service in Go or C and keep the huge Python productivity on all the other pieces. And so forth. Maybe, just maybe, you looked at your problems from the wrong POV...
Is this all django? 
Nö.
Nö.
This makes sense, thank you.
This would be a useful approach for what I'm trying to do, thank you.
Looks great! Is the frontend Django or some JS framework?
pretty much, you can better data just using the exchange APIs tho, scraping the data from html methods isn't worth it when binance has a candle request on their API. HTML scraping could work for social media but I'm not there yet. 
git diff master@{10 days ago}. #?
Explicit setters and getters in Python are discouraged though. Just use plain attributes. Unless you need something specific to happen when the attribute is looked up. class Student: def __init__(self, name): self.name = name self.grades = [] @property # makes it a 'getter' def mean_grade(self): return sum(self.grades) / len(self.grades) student = Student('craic') print(student.name) # just an attribute student.grades.append(6) student.grades.append(10) print(student.mean_grade) # looks like an attribute but has a getter [More info](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property).
Absolutely. Instead of walking away from the screen so they can have a think they just keep typing, not like when you had to think about what you were doing or your code came back from the data prep. dept. uncompiled :-)
Just to clarify, my drift was mostly around the context of this being a kind of beginner topic about classes in general. Your use case and level of knowledge wasn't where I was aiming at. Knowing when that kind of model is appropriate is really quite and advanced topic, so I think it's best to not even mention it in beginner or even intermediate tutorials, because you should have a very deep understanding of why you need that pattern. The danger is in shoehorning it into basic projects because it seems like a "cool feature that makes the code more enterprisey". Usually I've found in Python that less is more, and that advanced patterns can look deceptively simple, but the distinction is not obvious to newer Python coders!
From the [time module docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html):- &gt; On Unix, return the current processor time as a floating point number expressed in seconds. The precision, and in fact the very definition of the meaning of “processor time”, depends on that of the C function of the same name. &gt; On Windows, this function returns wall-clock seconds elapsed since the first call to this function, as a floating point number, based on the Win32 function QueryPerformanceCounter(). The resolution is typically better than one microsecond. &gt; Deprecated since version 3.3: The behaviour of this function depends on the platform: use perf_counter() or process_time() instead, depending on your requirements, to have a well defined behaviour. 
Oh I see what you're saying, yeah definitely true I was probably a bit over the top with classes. I use them commonly but I typically work on only a couple projects at a time so I'm always building up on top of what I have so I should have probably mentioned that. It's definitely a noisy world for beginners and I'm still trying to get my feet on solid ground too, I'm definitely still learning a lot about OOP!
Why ECS? It seems mostly independent from class architecture to me.
check blackhatworld forum, they specialize in that
On python 2.7
The code before it gets lost for ever rendering this post useless. def decorator(func): def wrap(*args): data = func() return data return wrap @decorator def foo(): x = 'bar' return locals() print(foo()) 
Yeah to be fair I don't think the guy I initially responded to was trying to make it sound like the point was 'never use classes' since that was just his quick synopsis. I was just kind of curious so I prodded a little bit since I'm not familiar with the video he was referring to. I think it'd be rare to find someone who adamantly opposed classes and OOP.
So click on the link I gave and then changing the `3` to a `2` will give you the 2.7 story.
That doesn't matter. The point is that `time.clock` measures CPU-time, not wall-time. 
I hope so. It just concerns me the tone is one of "knowledge sharing" when the knowledge is purportedly "how to write classes 101" when the examples are so fundamentally flawed.
Appreciate the tutorial. Man, as a python beginner do I ever hate having to mess around with global variables. I wish I could just pull in any variable into my functions. 
Learning less "popular" languages (not trying to open a can of worms here, just saying that python is kind of hip right now) will broaden your job prospects when you are out of school, and make you a more desirable job candidate in general.
Your python process would access files relative to it's current working directory, there is no change to that behaviour. To access the files in the package you use something like: import pkg_resources my_data = pkg_resources.resource_string(__name__, "foo.dat") which get the contents of foo.dat, but there are other ways to manager folders, filenames and even caches. https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html#basic-resource-access https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html#resourcemanager-api 
Shebang and chmod then. There is no use to pack binary to run a script. How heavy is a "PEX" ? Several MB ?
Fixing a few hundred sphinx-build warnings in our engineering documentation. Issues ranging from broken links to title underline too short. It sounds tedious, but the constant stream of little wins is quite addictive.
Whenever using a language feature, if you can answer "why" and you can defend that why them you can use it. For me personally I find the most oft reasons fall under dependency inversion and dependency injection.
&gt; I think it'd be hard to find anything written nowadays that isn't done in OOP Most of my Python code does not feature classes or only in a very limited way. Of course I use a lot of classes from (standard) libraries, but I don't think that is what you meant.
Awesome!
I am decent in Python, have been coding for ~ 6 months now. Not expecting to getting paid 100$/hour.. but probably can write scripts to automate stuff. In fact, I am currently write a full fledged application to automate the data analysis pipeline for a semiconductor company. Wondering if there are any websites where I should look for smallish gigs to build my resume, which pays out in cryptocurrencies (to reduce the headache of currency)?
Follow the advise in ajfriend's reply. https://docs.python.org/3/library/pkgutil.html#pkgutil.get_data
The best way to do it is with requests. Find an API and query it, it’ll be like 5 lines max including “import requests”. I think yahoo finance has an API you can use
I agree that multiple inheritance is bad - to me it is the second-worst Python "feature", after metaclasses. It leads to objects whose definitions are spread all over the place, and coupled in non-obvious ways. However, it is hard to make the argument that multiple inheritance is unpythonic, since it is a first-class language construct in Python - you don't need to jump through any hoops to do it.
I used quandl before but never got that extensive into it. There is a free set and also sets of data you can pay for.
Cool! I'll submit a PR sometime next week
Woah this is slick! All in Django??
What I don't understand, is how does this post get so many upvotes?
Note that if you do this for your class so that you can commit 2 hours after the deadline without losing points **this is academic dishonesty**.

tkinter should actually be installed by default.
Thanks a lot 
Just stay away from global variables in general. It makes your program very hard to reason about if it’s modifying state in some mysterious part of the program.
I still fail to see why I would apply any effort to a manipulate commit data besides to correct author in the rare case I forgot to create a proper .gitconfig . So somewhat we are on the same page. As far as academic honesty, I see college as an academic speed bump and a series of hoops to jump through-- that if you are lucky applies to the day to day of the real world. Granted, I tried to squeeze everything I could get out of it. But, a bunch of people got a meaningful piece of people for not truly meaningful effort... Academic honesty. I'll start caring about that when the administration starts making the criteria knowing the subject material and the underlying concepts.

What site are you trying to scrape from? Post a URL for a product that's giving you trouble. If the data isn't showing up in the source, it's probably doing some ajaxy late loading of the data, which is a huge pain in the ass.
I have a question. Your site is awesome. 
Even then wouldn't 2 Student objects be sharing the same class attribute? I think a better way to do this would be: class Students: def __init__(self): self.students = [] class Student: def __init__(self, name, student_id=123): self.name = name self.student_id = student_id students = Students() mike = Student('Mike', 123) jerry = Student('Jerry', 234) students.students.extend([mike, jerry])

Not really sure what the target audience or point of this video is. You are covering installation of 3rd party libraries, pip, python versions, Pypi, and other beginner topics, then you start talking about making web apps. People who don't understand that flask has to be installed don't know enough to make web apps, so this seems like a pointless video.
you must see my previous videos on my channel in the python playlist
soup.select('component-name, .tl') - names soup.select('.price, .nowrap') - prices than chunk it with regexp 
Hey thanks for the tips, what goes in the space for component-name though? If I have to type the actual complete product name to select the product that kind of defeats my purpose, I was more hoping to be able to group select them using what they have in common in the href link (which happens to be a prefix of "/product/"), or at least something along those lines If it helps the url in question is https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Shaco1993/saved/D8Dyf7.
In an Entity Component System... ehm.. system, every Enmtity is a Class, every Component is a class, and every System is a class. And they all inherit from a top Entity, Component and Systems class, With special Methods to add the Entities to the Pool and so on. I have not seen an implementation of ECS without OOP, not saying it can't be done though. 
Yep! Elasticsearch for the search engine though :)

That was my attempt at being funny. There isn’t really a question but more of an inquiry to know how that was done. All my Django sites are very CRUDdy and this one just has a different flow. If the source is available I would love to see it. But if it is not I would understand why. 
I think there’s a site called Alphavantage who have an excellent free API. 
Does anyone have a video somewhere? I need it to appreciate the drama.
I think it's not so bad to have a class attribute, since the scope is very clear. In your example everything is even more clear, but you need to remember to manually add the students to the list each time you create any. I think the possibility of forgetting to do so is a huge drawback that doesn't outweigh the benefit.
Hey man, hang in there! I've been in a similar situation and found that working on side projects / learning not only helped to distract me but also gave me tangible evidence that I was making progress. What kind of dashboard are you making? Is there a github?
The project contains 3rd party library docopt as a dependency, so you cannot just run a script unless you have docopt already installed in your environment. Binary is a self-contained way to distribute functionality the project provides without installing 3rd party packages at your machine. PEX size is 484K.
Started learning python on Saturday. Just wrote my first program. 5 lists, each containing dates, times, home teams, away teams, or TV channel. Input the team and the date you want, and the program tells you if there are any nationally televised games that day or not, along with those five pieces of information if true. I built it using index comparisons to find matches in arrays of the lists. 
/u/yash270, just in case you don't realise, I want to point out why you are getting downvoted on all your comments. It's because you don't really reply to feedback or engage in discussion. Instead you constantly encourage people to subscribe to your YouTube channel. It makes it seem like you are only interested in growing your number of subscribers, and not interested in improving your content.
Even if you don't use OOP personally in Python, a lot of the things you use in Python are written using OOP (lists, dicts, etc).
Thanks! 
Actually i am busy making tutorials so i dont get much time to reply people . appologize for my mistakes i would reply to all comments from now onwards u/Marein
Nice, a "from scratch" article that isn't just `import NeuralNetwork`.
Ahh haha :) Well I was going to put together some blogs post for a similar site and post the source code on github.. It'll be ready in a week or two so! I'll let you know?
Why would anyone do this?
as for communicating over the net, twisted is a solid library, but it may be overkill for what you want. Pyro4 could be a simpler solution if you require python programs to talk to each other in a client-server / RPC kind of way.
It's unfortunate that the optimizations cause problems on your system. They didn't on my (newer) version of Debian so you might consider upgrading?
Very nice, what is your plan marketing and monetizing wise?
many linux distributions separate the GUI libraries from the command line stuff. This makes it easier, more efficient and safer to configure a headless server environmnet where all those hundreds of megabytes of additional gui libraries and dependencies are useless. Hence the separate Tk package 
Not for production code obviously. You can use it for the first commit instead of the "initial commit" or "adding readme" or for personal projects where in most cases the commit messages are yangni because most of the fun personal projects are not going to be super popular and used by everyone like we want to believe it will be.

You could use a custom image where you can mount the code as a volume (e.g. https://github.com/yvnicolas/docker-odoo), that way you could add pdb or pudb or ipdb breakpoints in the code at will... Simple attach the container to your prompt and you're good to go. For development I would certainly advise running from source. It's not that difficult, just need Postgres, some, python deps in a venv and you're good to go :) https://www.odoo.com/documentation/10.0/setup/install.html#setup-install-source
At least you need to write a code of a web server and send a result of you `hello` function to a browser.

I suppose I'd have to reinstall everything for upgrading Debian version, so for now I rather keep this system. In the future I might reinstall everything and change Debian version, or install any other OS. Anyway, maybe the problem wasn't the optimizations, but the missing packages. Did both things before it was working fine. However I'll keep it installed as it is now, at least it works =)
They seem to all have the same python boot camp pinned to the top. IMO, a clever marketer wrote some python to sell a python boot camp. I’m kinda impressed tbh.
&gt; import requests ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests' pip install requests
Ive yet to write anything, but have enjoyed how the sendex YouTube channel presents material
How was this implemented?
install selenium and requests. https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/ pip install selenium and pip install requests might work from a command prompt.
Sounds like you may just need to install those modules, which is done with pip. First, set up your environment variables See 3.3.1 here: https://docs.python.org/2/using/windows.html When that's done, open a command window (Windows key + r, then type in 'cmd' and click 'Run'), and type: pip install requests Followed by: pip install selenium On mobile or I would verify, good luck!
 numbers = range(0, 100) prime = [number for number in numbers if number not in (0, 1) and all(number % i != 0 for i in range(2, number))] print(prime)
Very true, but OP said he used Anaconda which installs tkinter if I'm not mistaken.
What do you mean?
Sorry for being late, but here's the code for the site: https://gist.github.com/TheZehn/08cd1329292c49dfe71749115e9e278d it uses the coinbase API to get bitcoin price. I get the price of avocado from a different piece of code that runs once a week and saves it to a local file which the code above pulls in. That code scrapes a website that lists avocado prices: https://gist.github.com/TheZehn/c8bfb2c138f7c1383b03a6594681f871 If you have any questions, let me know.
Thanks a ton! Indeed the answer was wrong for the first few hours. I have fixed it quickly after releasing the puzzle as there were several hints. :)

Why would anyone sign up for a boot camp where their pitch is they make broken shit?
Because someone who’s considering a boot amp doesn’t know enough to know that’s broken shit

Every Python tutorial... "how easy is it to get started with Python?! Easy enough to make a Twitter bot, let's get started!"
Not the marketer. I don’t endorse what they’re doing. It’s scummy and obnoxious. I just admire the evil genius of it.
You can also use: with open(filename, 'r') as file: line_total = len(file.readlines()) 
Spam bots are genious now? Lmao
this is an assignment for a class, and I'm supposed to debug that code (not re-write it) so I'm just trying to fix what was given! But I'll def post to learnpython next time, didn't realize that existed :) 
this was my function for counting words: def num_words_in_file(filename): fileref = open(filename,'r') whole_str = fileref.read() fileref.close() words = whole_str.split() total_words = len(words) return(total_words)
Oh, I see! In which case that's a bit strange, since I'm not seeing anything that shouldn't work. Does it raise any exceptions or behave wrong? Try putting some print calls here and there (or use pdb but that's probably overkill) to suss it out
Ok, changing the last line of the code to return float(total_words_file)/float(line_total) worked! I still dont understand why the regular / changed my answer to an integer so if you have any insights that would be helpful! Otherwise, thanks for your help :) 
Thank you! :) 
Damn. Back when I made my [Twitter bot](https://github.com/rhiever/TwitterFollowBot), it was still a relatively unique thing. Guess I better branch out to Reddit bots.
sadly, I had to take off the hashtag #Python and #automation from my (automated) tweets because of the follows then unfollow bots.
Its extremely rudamentary and most people here are beginners.
https://docs.python.org/release/2.2.3/whatsnew/node7.html
That makes sense but only if beginners also don't read/write comments. I guess that could be the case.
With python I hope
It is.

And embrace another old and annoying trend?
if you follow, post, reply, etc in niche topics you'll start getting follows from bots in that topic
Hm... I feel as if I'm not going to be much help at this point I'm sorry to say. However, my hail Mary is to try this all again- but in Python 2 instead of python 3. I'm not certain what the bot requires, but this is a good place to help get started: https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb/wiki/Python-&amp;-pip-Windows-installation Sorry I'm not more help, on mobile atm. One last question that might help- what's the bot? Does it have a home page (github, etc.)?
So when these encryption programs are sold online, do they all use a very similar encryption?
The good ones do. That said, if you're paying for a file encryption program, you're probably making a mistake anyway - it's generally much safer to use proven, open source tools like GPG.
I see, any suggestions on programs I could work towards that would be worth paying for?
I am not at a computer right now to give example code, but this can be achieved by reading the file as a stream and reading one character at a time and processing the the string each time you reach a delimiter (in this case, a comma). If you remove the Insert part of your sql file and code that into your script you can read through the entire file with a very small memory footprint. Pseudo-code: parsedString = "" with open file as f: char = f.read(1) if(char != ","); parsedString += char else: cursor.execute("INSERT INTO Table VALUES " + parsedString) parsedString = "" &lt;You may need to handle the end of file condition delicately here. Also, commit your transaction&gt;
Honestly, if your goal is to make money, you should probably just get a job in the field. Building a product that's worth paying for with no experience and no resources is _extremely_ difficult.
This was really interesting - thanks! BTW, I think there’s an error in calculating the example inputs to the middle node in the hidden layer: (9 * .3) = 2.7 (2 * .6 ) = 1.2 Those sum to 3.9 but you have it as 7.5 in both your images and your text. Unless I’m missing something?
That's my error. I re-calculated it but the final score is only affected by a hundredth of a decimal. 
Going with a dictionary is the right approach. You can't have the value of a dictionary key be multiple items, but you can have the value be something like an array, which can have multiple values. One possible thing you might consider is having the tags be the keys, and then use a set of the units as your value. The reason I suggest using sets is because sets already have an intersection capability implemented to them, so you could easily filter with multiple tags (which is what you want to do if I understand correctly). 
Did you bother to look at the graph before deriving standard deviation values? Look at the blue bar: nothing is below 2.0s and certainly nothing over 2.25s. It's a flat distribution. Why are you fitting a Gaussian to it? Let alone a Gaussian that seems to encompass about 1.6 - 2.4s in its core. The orange distribution - sure, that looks like a Gaussian isn't the silliest thing to do as a basic first pass on quantifying its performance. The blue one though is fundamentally different. Still, it's fair to compare the two distributions and you can certainly derive something like median and almost any percentile you want. With only n=100 you shouldn't rely on, say, the 1st or 99th percentile but the 20th and 80th should be reasonably stable.
Which makes a lot sense since enough training will always override the initial weights. I was simply confused because I was trying to replicate what you were describing. Thanks for confirming I’m not crazy.
What obvious code did he do?
How can they be "my" videos when its stolen Pluralsight content.
1: /r/learnpython 2: The way you're doing it, you need to use a second variable to store the total.
If you want to learn the basics of cryptography, you should probably pick up a book on the subject. Schneier's "Applied Cryptography" can be slow going but his break down of how many algorithms work is top notch. It's twenty years old now so you won't get a breakdown on more recent ciphers but you'll need to learn to walk before you run.
I use Jupyter tools to build what I have made. But scriptedforms can't be used within Jupyter, at least not yet. It's aimed use case is for you to be able to wrap up some key analysis, or program, or utility into an interactive user interface that you and others can then quickly and repeatedly use. For us it will be replacing tasks that our team currently will try and use excel for.
Slow down and make better tutorials. Based on what I've seen in this video your tutorials are just more "blind leading the blind". 
Google "cryptography roll your own". Crypto is very hard to get right.
If you want to use something like manipulate within Jupyter give http://jupyter.org/widgets a try.
As I said, your rubbish is just pathetic crap, silly little quizzes that are effectively meaningless to even professional programmers but are less than useless to newbies.
I haven't got a clue but why don't you ask on the [main tkinter mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/tkinter-discuss), also available on gmane.
I want to say you can via subprocess, but in my opinion, if you really need async, just use Go. Alternatively, you can also build libraries with Rust and call them with cffi in python.
My twitter account has like, 4 or 5 tweets over 6 years or so. One of them was vaguely python related, and the same thing happened to me soon after. Most of them went away eventually, but for awhile I had around 25 folowers, and 20 of them were somehow related to python.
A little disappointed to not see any discussion and comparison with Python's standard library asyncio or async functions.
I do enjoy a good joke and this is just fantastic, really funny, clearly the OP has never heard of the NSA or GCHQ, or the other organisations around the world that do similar things. Mind you it's great fun trying to get things to work, crypto sync is much more difficult to get than simply syncing any old transmission line.
If you are interested this is probably the most widely used algorithm is https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard . You might want to implement that to learn but I don't think you'd be able to sell something based on that and also caution you as it's very easy to make mistakes with cryptography.

is a set the same as an array? I'm very new to python/programming so l apologise for dumb questions. But yeah doing the reverse of what I thought does make much more sense. Thank you so much. 
A bot didn't work? Great, as far as I'm concerned they're just a PITA.
Beacuse there is none... Goroutines and channels are so easy and powerfull anyone can write multithreaded apps with ease. See http://nesv.github.io/golang/2014/02/25/worker-queues-in-go.html
No, you're much better off using C(++) or similar, as their statically and weakly typed approach are always superior to Python's strong and dynamically typed approach. Now it's time for my daily chat with the pixies at the bottom of my garden.
You can use the [place geometry manager](http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/place.htm) instead of pack or grid to accomplish this. Just as an FYI, make sure you don't mix two different geometry managers in your program.
Wow I'm so impressed that I'm going to put you up for the Victoria Cross. Not.

I think an ``apt dist-upgrade`` should do the trick without reinstalling everything, but don't trust me on this! :)
They're bots. It turns out that if you have an account follow users with low to medium amounts of followers, 10-20% will follow it back when they see the notification if you used decent targeting. 
Yeah! It's really useful for debugging. I think the important differentiation is that this works without having to import anything into any of your files so it's more easily injectable into an existing project without having to modify any of the existing code.
I'd be more impressed if they did it with like two accounts, tweeted useful stuff and snuck in their link only occasionally.

I have my fair share of debugging print statements littered though out my code and this actually looks kinda useful. But isn't the correct approach to just use an actual debugging tool such as pdb or some built in one from an IDE?
Maybe later!
Okay, what does `num_words_in_file` actually do, as the file has all ready been opened and then closed? Further why not cut and paste code direct onto this site site rather than a flaming png file which we can't cut and paste from to try out?
The long-term solution for Python is probably to run multiple Python interpreters within a single OS process, each with its own stack and hence own GIL. This is, apparently, already technically possible within the C-API, but there are likely a lot of implementation details that would have to be ironed out. I would say the main problem with Golang is everything other than coroutines. The other thing Golang does extremely well is distribution, but its niche is server-side apps, so that's not such a useful feature. 
Okay no problem. Didn't mean to post in the wrong place just looking for help. I'll be sure to post future questions in /r/learnpython.
Pandas not panda

yes, but still gives the same message 'There is no module named pandas
yes, but still gives the same message 'There is no module named pandas
Have you installed pandas ? Pip3 install pandas 
I have installed anaconda, but when I typ this it says that Pip3 is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
I'm not familler with anaconda. You might need to install pandas since it doesn't come with python3 by default.
Dude I made a type on reddit.. it still gives the same error message.
I tell you hwhatt
I installed it, but still gives the same : no module named pandas
Python is probably the most popular language for data science due to it's easy file handling, libs like numpy, pandas, and Tensorflow, and it's easy interop with C and Fortran.
Maybe the bot is one of the assignments in the boot camp.
Update on a python dash app for cryptocurrency tracking that some of you helped with: So it looks like whales that build walls found a work-around to my whale-watching app. Sucks for them though because I found a work-around to their work-around, so now even if the whales stack different orders of the same volume AND same price, I can still see that it's just one person behind a particular buy / sell wall. For anyone that hadn't heard about this yet (I know a lot of you have helped and offered advice so big thanks to you all!) check out the GitHub here. All you need is Python installed and you can run it locally :) https://github.com/pmaji/eth_python_tracker PS, linking the ETH donation address here (hoping to raise enough to host this on a website via AWS).

All python savants are welcome to look / comment. The next item up is moving from automatic refresh to a push-to-click refresh system. 
You are after "Multiple-precision Integers" and numpy is for parallel vector operations. https://github.com/aleaxit/gmpy 
https://gmplib.org/manual/Integer-Logic-and-Bit-Fiddling.html I can see that those bit-level operations like xor, etc are wrapped in the library so perhaps you should just try them and see. 
alright cool, appreciate it!
Hello! What I recommend doing is opening up the Anaconda Prompt (you can find it from your start menu, in the Anaconda3 (64-bit) folder). Once it is open type "conda install pandas" minus the quotes. Pandas should be one of the easily retrievable libraries with Anaconda. If that doesn't work for you, try typing "pip install pandas" instead. One of those should definitely work. It will prompt you to hit Y or N midway through the install. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode
**Bytecode** Bytecode, also termed portable code or p-code, is a form of instruction set designed for efficient execution by a software interpreter. Unlike human-readable source code, bytecodes are compact numeric codes, constants, and references (normally numeric addresses) that encode the result of compiler parsing and semantic analysis of things like type, scope, and nesting depths of program objects. The name bytecode stems from instruction sets that have one-byte opcodes followed by optional parameters. Intermediate representations such as bytecode may be output by programming language implementations to ease interpretation, or it may be used to reduce hardware and operating system dependence by allowing the same code to run cross-platform, on different devices. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Why should someone pay for this when they could take fast.ai for free?
Are you doing arithmetic too? +/-? Otherwise I'd just use C honestly, store the data as a big array of bytes and iterate over it to do the bitwise operations. Recent GCCs will probably vectorize it for you.
So...
Try it in a C based language. meal *= (1 + tax); If you want immutable primitives, look elsewhere.
My god. That's even worse!
Guys, I'm also kind of half joking about this so please don't take me too seriously.
That's always a valid question when you have high quality courses available online for free. However, the existence of Udemy (and its million of users) says that people would want to pay for a different approach. While the people at coursera might be a lot more qualified than me, there is such as thing as difference of approach. Some people just might like my method better and hence be willing to pay. Another aspect is that there are gaps left in the free courses because they assume people will put in the effort. For many people, that effort is too great because of several reasons. Hence the supporting roles. Finally, since we're getting paid for the course, we provide better support in terms of Q&amp;A. If you see the preview lectures, you will see that I provide a real-time chat support system for Q&amp;A. Of course, for some, this might not justify the cost. For others, it does. =]

I'm not supposed to use any additional python modules. I've found a working solution which is like this: decimal_data = struct.unpack_from('!22B', rawData, 12) data="" for num in: char = chr(num) data+= char
Actually that's not what immutable means. Immutable means you can't change the *value* that the *name* refers to ... not that you can't change the name, or re-use or re-assign the name. Any language that allows a **for** loop -- which most would agree is a pretty standard construct -- *must* allow name reassignment, otherwise for loops would have to look like this: for i0, i1, i2, i3, i4 in range(5): ... And I don't even want to get into the pain of a **while** loop with a new name for the accumulator on each loop.
Well, you got the right username for that attitude.
Thanks for the bit of detail.

I've just released version 1.0 of my language that I built from scratch https://github.com/lduck11007/MontiLang
I have no clue what I'm talking about, but is it possible you have multiple versions installed?
Please see this [guide on managing environments](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) with Anaconda. However, before you do that, if due to some black-magic your interpreter is python2, you might want to quickly try: &gt; pip install pandas i.e. pip with no "3" obv. and see if you are able to import pandas.
Hmm possibly. How would I fix that? 
Should I do not this in cmd or in the anaconda prompt. Because in cmd it wont work, and it is installed in the anaconda prompt 
If pip did not work then you likely do not have a separate python2 install. I would move ahead with the link on managing environments.
Because they harm you why exactly? I don't get it, yes they are bots but it's not like they can do anything besides reading what you anyhow shouted into the void So what?

Well, some of my important clients are from twitter. When my number goes down, my earning goes down. So it is not that teenage attention gathering shit anymore. 
First of all it's against twitters TOS: https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/report-spam Secondly, arguing that it doesn't hurt you personally is pretty short sighted. If everyone ignores these bots Twitter will quite soon become utter useless (although one can argue that for many it already is).
Yeah! HAML needs some TLC 😉 I’m actually curious what the advantages of Jinja(2). To me HTML is such a mess. HAML reads easy and keeps the HTML nice and clean, especially when you mix in code.

I'm going to write a blog post on how to create a similar site with and without JS! Good luck, here to help if needed.

I think twilio can recieve sms? I used it for sending sms but can not recall receiving... check it out. It has a python API which is easy to work with.

Hahaha, that's the way I feel everytime I hear there's languages with arrays starting at 1
What about John P Riley &amp; Lawrence Watt-Evans &amp; Alan Dean Foster? One of these things is not like the others. Split the string on ampersands first to get a list of authors, which may be one author long. Then parse each of those names with all possible regular expressions. Yes, you can put them in a list and iterate over the list. What do these numbers mean? Are they just dummy values? If you only want the names, use a set instead of a dict. Dicts are for key/value pairs. Don't create separate regex variables in the first place; just put them in a literal list or tuple at the start. 
Twilio isn't the answer. Thanks for the help tho !
It means "please subscribe, even though I have no content".
It's all about learning. We also have more complex algorithms like Dijkstra, though most users prefer the shorter code snippets.

In other words, roughly 100 python instances to a "hello world" in electron?
Poe’s law
What's the lowest number of Python instances doing the same job, you can push a Node instance down to? I know this is really a comparision of async go with threaded python, so it seems weird to bring Node into the fray. But as we live in the century of the javascript, huge amount of memory use is totally acceptable, so the overhead of multiprocessing vs. async isn't going to keep me awake at night. 
&gt; Missing out on asyncio makes the article somewhat uninteresting. Didn't need to fail mentioning asyncio to be uninteresting: &gt; What if there is shared data? Then the same story repeats. You should use the locks &amp; semaphores to communicate using shared memory. […] &gt; We saw threads and greenlets in action. In Go, when communication is needed between threads it uses a different strategy as “Share data by communication, but do not communicate by sharing data”. To understand how this statement is justified in Go, we should know thread counterpart in go and few message passing mechanisms. Both baseline and gevent have Queues (though afaik no equivalent to `select`, and it's non-trivial to replicate fully as I don't think there's any built-in way to multiplex either queues or events) though depending on your exact needs you can probably get a long way with get_nowait and put_nowait.
On my machine, node (6) baseline seems to be ~twice Python (I'm always a bit confused by classification of memory in OSX, a node shell is 8.5 memory, 17.2 real, 8.3 private while a python shell is 5.1 memory, 7.1 real, 4.9 private).
You installed praw using conda most likely which is stuck at 3.6.2. 
What do you mean by "host" here?
When you forward a port to an IP address in your network then the server needs to run on the mentioned IP address, not on your public IP address. If you want your local clients to connect to the port on the public IP address then you need to enable NAT loopback on the router, which may not be supported by all routers.
Yes, which is essentially what `setuptools` uses under the hood. I think.
Not quite. pip is really just a command line interface for distutils. setuptools is a third-party extension to the standard library distutils.
&gt; Basically - it feels like I should be able to put my regex strings in a list, Create a list of regex objects then for every file name loop through the list of regex until one matches, extract group(1), group(2), group(3)... without creating a ladder of if..elsif.... Yes, you're able to do exactly that, just as you wrote it. What's the problem exactly? In case there's more that one author, I'd recommend iterating over all groups (`match.groups()`) and adding them as authors, and in case you would later need even more complicated rules involving groups you could use non-capturing groups `(?: ...)`. Though as /u/confluence said, you probably should do things in a more hierarchical fashion: first try to split the file name into name - genre - author(s) by `' - '`, then split a list of author names by ampersands, then sanity-check each name using something like `([A-Z]\.? | [A-Z]\w*(-\w+)*)+` (a name is at least one name component, a name component is either a single capital letter (optionally followed by a dot) or a bunch of non-empty subcomponents separated by spaces). 
You can't "host" on your public IP, since that's not actually associated with any network interfaces on your pi. The public IP is on your router. If you want to serve public traffic, you have to host on your local IP (or 0.0.0.0 for all interfaces), and setup port forwarding for port 80 (or 443 for https) on your router to forward that traffic to your pi.
Apologies, my mistake.
Do you mean OpenShift?
Could you tell us more about your experience?
1. create a list of patterns, you may want to wrap them into some other object so you can perform the extraction of name bits name_patterns = [fname_lname_re, fname_mi_lname_re, …] 2. match all of these matches = [p.match(file) for p in name_patterns] 3. get the first one that's not `None`, here again wrapping patterns in some other object would be useful so you could have a useful [null object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_object_pattern) instead of just None but… match = next(filter(None, matches), None) An alternative would be to add one more pattern at the end of the list which *always* matches, such that you will never have "no matches" and can get rid of the default value in the call to `next 4. at this point you'll need to dispatch the extraction method, you could add indices to the matches in order to pick the extractor from a second list, or if you wrap patterns in your own object that object's `match` can return a more semantically convenient object e.g. one which knows how to output whatever data you need
**Null object pattern** In object-oriented computer programming, a null object is an object with no referenced value or with defined neutral ("null") behavior. The null object design pattern describes the uses of such objects and their behavior (or lack thereof). It was first published in the Pattern Languages of Program Design book series. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
I guess I wasn't thinking about Python. Technically in Python you would use a "class" to make a struct, since members (attributes) are always public. I'm thinking of a stricter definition of class that uses immutable types and private members.
Further to other, I must say sound answers, how about writing one big regex using the [verbose flag](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.VERBOSE) to make it easier to read? Then you've no `if elif` chain to maintain. `lastindex` tells you how many groups have matched, if any.
Indeed. What you say makes perfect sense in other languages, just not so much python. 
Please don't bother with /r/learnpython as some answers are poor or even plain wrong. If you correct them the posters throw their toys out of the pram. Much better to go to one of the main, tutor or help python lists or even stackoverflow.
If they're not sharing memory, how is this functionally different to python's existing multiprocessing?
Twitter got a lot better with spammy accounts for the past months. Noticed many bot ad companies shut down!
Pyautogui is a great library! 
That's pretty good explanation
This is the way I used to think as well. Yeah functional programming could enlighten your understanding.
This is the reason there are more spammy accounts of Python than those of JavaScript 
To clarify the other answers, the older, lower level, but still very valid method is a **requirements.txt** file which can be used by **pip** -- the Python package manager -- to specify and install dependencies. The newer, higher level, and forward-looking method is the **Pipfile** and **Pipfile.lock**. Both of the above are projects of the [Python Packaging Authority](https://packaging.python.org/) and their User Guide at that link is really helpful. It also touches on **pipenv**, a separate project that is the first to automate **Pipfile** creation and locking. 
Try using pip3 Pip3 install flask
You’re missing parenthesis in the line above it. 
1) Post questions like this in /r/learnpython. 2) Put 4 spaces at the beginning of each code line to have reddit format it as code, so that it's readable. 3) If you reference an error that you're getting, post the error. It probably contains information about the nature of the bug, and its location in the code. 2) Multiple lines are missing closing brackets, including the one right before `class Mike:`, hence the SyntaxError.
The format is hard to read. You should put everything in a code block. Where are the return statements in your class's init() methods?
Do http://www.cryptopals.com/ before you do anything else. 
I would argue the Node js tuts pushing their API's for everything are just as prominent.
Your missing two closing parenthesis on the Raindrops.append() Like above it
In a command line, run your program with `python helloworld.py`. You might be running this inside IDLE. FYI - The correct subreddit for this type of post is /r/learnpython . This subreddit is more of an area to discuss the python language in use, not learning it. It is good practice to read the right sidebars for information about a subreddit before posting. This is posted at the very top.
Ok thanks for the help. Sorry about that.
No problem. Welcome to Python. There are many people who will give you the help you need over there.
You don't have to pickle objects to transfer them, you just have to transfer ownership of that particular memory block. Big difference. Goroutines also have their own memory space: https://dave.cheney.net/2013/06/02/why-is-a-goroutines-stack-infinite 
As I understand it, electron is not really a bad choice other than it being a bit resource heavy. There may be other issues but that is the main complaint I have heard. 
Python developer for hire :) I know django (average - built two sites, supporting about 3), flask (basically), but mostly doing web scraping (LXML, requests, selenium, scrapy) and bot making (both using requests-forging). I have an ability to quickly learn and implement new technology as I get to it. I'm working on a freelance market for a year now and I'm constantly looking for new clients to work with! 
We have [a pretty long list of learning resources in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index#wiki_new_to_programming.3F). Try a few and see what resonates. For a brand new programmer I'd recommend codecademy. Also, if you don't have one already make sure you look for a project that interests you and start on it as soon as you can. Programming is a lot more fun if you have a goal. Come visit us in /r/learnpython if you get stuck. 
Flask has been a godsend for me the last few years. You will probably be able to standup the web app faster and make updates easier than you could with pyqt and working with updating, versioning or os specific bits
Cool site. Looking forward to the blog post
You might be interested in dash. https://github.com/plotly/dash
Electron is cancer.
If you share more on the kind of application you're trying to build, that would be helpful since different applications can benefit from different architectures. Also, how important is it to you that your app works and looks identical on Mac, windows and linux?, Considering you want it to run on all three platforms
Thanks! And how should I input several algurments? Separated by comma, within '' or "", etc?
Sorry about the sketchy link
100% of my kids that are alive today can swim u know that for sure
I clicked the link for this, then saw another video showing all the cameos Elon musk has been in and went down a YouTube hole for a while there. Then I never watched your vid... I promise to come back to it. Fuck YouTube.
PyQt makes a lot of sense for a desktop app, Flask does not, unless the developer has never done desktop GUI and knows packaging Electron or similar as well. 
I followed the readme instructions. When I run the 2nd command, I get this. https://i.imgur.com/mGwIB0H.png 
Don't be silly
thatsthejoke.py
&gt; A native application built on qt will always be better. But its not exactly friendly for a developer to write since it has a somewhat low level interface. a lot of QT is pretty high-level. depending on the requirements, it's possible to write virtually no c++ and stick to QML and javascript (or whatever they call their flavor of javascript)
Something else to consider is that PyQT is either GPL (**not** LGPL) or you need to purchase a commercial license for it. Similarly, Qt (which is used by pyQT) is either GPL/LGPL or you need to purchase commerical license. Using Flask/electron can probably be done with only BSD/MIT -style licensed code. There is no option to buy commerical licenses of these libraries. This may push you one way or the other depending on what kind of application you're building and your company's policy regarding open source software usage. 
Cheating is definitely not okay-- but, the bigger fish to fry is that I am losing faith in the institution to put out people that know their shit. You missed the whole point that they are graduating people that didn't actually learn anything and the credentials paid for aren't worth the paper they are printed on. And I'll worry about cheating when that bigger problem is solved. I don't even care anymore. Either you can do the critical thinking which can be demonstrated on the spot or you can't. The other diligence part, you can't really gauge that in an interview and well chosen references won't help you discern it. There are people-- somehow, I don't feel they paid a whole lot of attention in class. Or it was beyond their capacity or whatever. But, if an applicant shows up and can apply apparent skill towards a posed problem-- they are in. I just don't care if they copied all their answers in their gym class final. I am not ashamed, but the secondary education system is super broken and I really do only care about the end results-- not how anyone got there. When it is all over, is the person prepared to go out there and kick ass with both feet? Yes. Great. A schmuck with a degree and no useful talents or insights is worthless. Tell me how cheating undermines both of those last two statements. I posit that cheating is irrelevant-- because the actual goal is to just get the paper and be able to perform. Not being able to perform is the disqualifying metric.
Did you know some books or good tutorials about Dash? THanks
Don't be sorry; just don't be surprised if you get downvoted. Reddit's good at that.
You are half right. My attitude is bad. I won't feel shame about it though and here is why: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/7wd649/git_commit_time_machine/du3cy2u/ It should be the reply to /u/GNULinuxProgrammer, just above this post. It is at this time, but that is subject to change.
Thanks for the question. It means that a new series of video tutorials will start within few days. I do not know your field of Python programming but I hope you will be interested in the topics. For more information, you may read the article about the series on: https://www.mechtutor.com/numerical-computing-with-python/

Audio Engineer, here. That seems like it would be an incredibly difficult project, as you would have to combine GUI and audio handling functions and methods, not to mention load management and latency handling. You would be better off building a VST first before moving forward with a DAW. 
My main goal is to create a sort of interactive piano roll with a list of editable sounds that you can put together, export/import. I'm not focused on plugins, or recording, etc... yet, just the piano roll (if that's what it's called).
You can look at REAPER to see how you can do some scripting with it using Python. 
 specializing in Internet security.... I want to build an arbitrage cryptocurrency trading bot. ?? Two different things. Your bot exists in 1000's of forms on Github. I could give you at a handful of links that already exist. 
I was drinking while on code academy and prone to mild outbursts of outrage. Won't happen again. 
I read 'python for everyone' last year and I just finished a &gt;3,000 line financial program that tracks, manages, plots, and records data on the user's finances. I couldn't have believed a book about anything could have been as good as that book was, not just in explaining, but its so easy to reference that info later on when you need to. Read that book, then instead of reading another book, read that one again.
How the thing works: In "main" you can call or text your friends just as skype or icq when you are in the app, you need to put informations in your profile about (age, gender, location, first language, second language, knowledge of) "notifications" is where you receive notifications ! it's a message "people" is the list of all that are online Lets say have a question about nebuchadnezzar You go to "people", use the filter and select "knowledge of history" after applying the filter, you find 32 000 matching people out of 500 000 online you send a notification to them they will receive the notification and will reply to you, also by notification or by instant message or by calling from the 32 000 , there will be like 15 that know the subject very well last step: call them and enjoy your instant answer ! 
The advantage is that you are using Python, not bash. For example, the other day at work I used the subprocess module to replace an ugly bash script with a bunch of `sed`s and `awk`s to python's cleaner syntax. Here is the module documentation, for those who care. https://docs.python.org/3.2/library/subprocess.html 
I like it
PySide2 is LGPL.
Let say there are 15 thousand concurrent users. You have a general question aimed at people around the age of 30, which is about half, so 7.5 thousand. It benefits you to cast a wide net, because hey, bigger chance of an answer. Every hour, about 1 in 100 users have a question about something. So 150 questions per hour, that also aims for a wide net, on average half the users. Which means if I take a 20 minute break, I have 10 questions waiting for me. On high use days, say 500 thousand concurrent users, I'll have something like 400 messages waiting for me. Yeah, I'm gonna delete that app. And besides, there is no incentive for me to bother to reply. With Reddit, if I have a field of expertize, I'll likely frequent that subreddit with other peers. Which is likely the place people go to ask questions. There I can answer, and make inroads with the community as my reply will make me better know by everyone there. 
I can barely read that, the resolution is so low, but it certainly looks like you're not in the same directory as the script you want to run. Try to cd to that directory and run it. Or, alternatively, run `python c:\the\path\to\main.pyw`.
&gt; There are no true threads in Python. On top, we have GIL(Global Interpreter Lock) which never allows me to utilize multiple cores (on a minimum two core machine). This is just simply wrong. Python has “true” threads. The GIL, however, allows only one to execute code at a time, which isn’t really a problem for IO-bound code. Python’s `multiprocessing` library also allows for true parallelism using multiple cores, despite the GIL. The overhead comes in the pickling of Python objects for execution on those cores.
Wait a second. There will be no spam because there will be moderators. If you receive notifications, they will not bother you because the notications stay in notifications ( they won't pop up in the middle of your screen ), just don't click on "notifications" then
And you're going to pay these people in doge coin, right? It can only go up!
If it's not important for it to feel like a native app, you can build it as a web application and deliver it with very little bloat, because everyone already has a browser installed. This can be a few MB, whereas a PyQt app is probably tens of MB. Relying on users' browsers means you have all the compatibility and security issues that come with that, but that might not be a problem; it depends what the app does. If it needs to be a 'real' desktop app, i.e. running outside the browser, then the web route means bundling it with something like Electron. That's likely to mean a much bigger package, and you'll probably end up writing most of it in Javascript, rather than Python. The other consideration is that Python web development is (anecdotally) far more popular than PyQt, so it's probably easier to find people to work on an app built with web frameworks.
The numbers you gave are not correct. The program will be made to be working well. If you are still not clicking on the "notifications", you will be benefiting from the app that will provide you instantly people to help you in anything. You can also meet and socialize with a lot of people
That's an obvious error. Thanks for pointing it out for beginers
I'll try that
All of those tools will _use modules_. Read their source.
&gt; The program will be made to be working well. Mhm.
In the Elixir language immutability rules 
Really depends on what you're doing. You may think grep syntax looks ugly for example, but it runs far faster than what people would (incorrectly) assume they could just replace with a simple python regex. (Grep runs a very optimized algorithm) 
That post is super cringe. I don't care what your beliefs are to academia or academics but if you're ok taking advantage of unfair situations in the system and write 3 paragraph apology for it ('Cheating is not ok buuuuuuut.........it's sometimes necessary amiright and I don't even care') you're a cheater. Do not talk about this attitude with your coworkers because they will inevitably feel bad that they did honestly in life and came to the same point you did by cheating. As someone who hires new engineers to my company, I really wish I don't accidentally hire people like you. **Ethics is an important part of engineering.** We are human beings, and being human gives conscience, and the bare minimum of that conscience is honesty. If you think it might be okay to cheat your way through the system because you lost hope in academia, you're dishonesty and dishonest people should be engineers. Period.
Working with NetfilterQueue to intercept, analyze and detect security problems and data exfiltration. 
&gt; virtually no c++ and stick to QML and javascript In the **PY**qt sub? Come on...
If the software will only be used internally, the GPL doesn’t matter. If it will be distributed to the public or sold then it definitely does, but a PyQt license is cheap. The question starts to be whether he needs a *QT* license, which is unlikely but might turn out relatively pricey.
Learned how to use QRCode library to create said QR codes for a group (scanned at events and such). Right now it's a simple CLI script and it takes member ID number, name, date paid membership (or indicates non-paid). Now I'm reading up on Flask to make it a web-accessible form accessible from phone, tablet, etc. But maybe use Django. Or Bottle. The drudgery is looking over what each offers and deciding how much or how little is needed. 
3.2, wtf?
Python isn't well suited to this task I fear. However, since your requirements are simple I would head the "game" route and use pygame, pyglet or even Kivy. Or you could do it properly and use Juce. https://juce.com/discover 
Haha just grabbed the first link from Google, oh well.
I'm really starting to get pissed off now, that's two common sense answers I've seen on reddit this weekend :-)
Python is an interpreted language and Grep is a compiled C binary so of course it's not as fast. I used Python in this case because speed wasn't the priority, having simple readable code that other people can work with was. 
'm well aware of what python is. It's not just a compilation issue. There are cases where python *can* be faster than grep, depending on the search parameters. But in the general case grep is faster because of the optimized Boyer-Moore search algorithm it employs.
Now this. https://i.imgur.com/KZ8Ks2m.png
Instead of Cygwin I would suggest installing Windows Linux Subsystem.
really nice
To repeat for the umpteenth time please don't waste your time with /r/learnpython as some of the advice there is poor if not plain wrong. If you correct the numpties they throw their toys out of the pram. For sound advice go to any of the main, tutor or help python mailing lists or even stackoverflow.
Webapp might be a way to go. It dependent on a few questions: - how many platforms ? - main purpose ? 
[Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com/) is what you need. You can publish datasets and run kernels (scripts) in Python or R via Jupyter notebooks. It's like GitHub but for data science/analysis :)
If I may, let me refine my question a bit: what would be the advantage of running it as a .py file as opposed to a .sh file? The video shows him using IDLE, which I understand the advantage there. But let’s say I have a .sh file in a cron job; would it be advantageous to write it in .py file instead? 
Have you considered [virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/en/documentation/public-api/#)? 
Four things you got wrong. 1 I didn't need to cheat in college or at any other level. In many classes I was the curve. Copying would have earned me lesser marks besides it isn't without it's own investment of effort that seemed like more work and more risk-- just plain seemed like a choice without enough benefit. My accounting professors would have probably preferred it if I had, as the exception... 2 I am okay with skipping and skimping on things that don't matter. I am most certainly against cutting corners on material matters or shirking duty. Like I said, you can do the job or you can't. If you can't meet the specifications, that is the disqualifying metric. I suppose ethics could be a component of that-- but meeting requirements is often a very objective measure that we don't even need to get into the subjective shoulda, woulda, coulda of ethics. There is no cheating on requirements, it is or it isn't. On the setting the requirements side, who puts themselves under unnecessary risk by requesting insufficient limits...? Competency is what you hopefully get out of a college education and that is first. Cheating or academic honesty or a list of other things isn't first. You assume I assign no value to academic honesty and that I am an unethical person which is ignorant bullshit. It just isn't in the top 5 for me. 3 You realize that your argument is protecting the unethical practices churning out crummy graduates. I am saying I value the people that successfully acquired the skills and knowledge I am seeking with the ability to effectively apply them. Where's your precious ethics there? 4 You said I apologized. My wife is laughing her ass off. I'll be sure to send the useless applicants that are the purest of the pure your way. You are welcome to the last word in this argument. 
[Maybe we can just get rid of the GIL!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLqv11ScGsQ) 
There exist web engines such as Electron which are very suitable for writing desktop applications (although they can't reasonably target very low end computers). Some examples of desktop applications that are actually web apps include Spotify, Discord, Visual Studio Code, and Atom.
I have, and they are a good idea/option.... except if I want to check multiple files at once since they limit checks to 4 every minute. If the script were to be applied to a folder, it would take a while to check just the folder and be much slower than any alternative system. I did consider the “premium” speed option on their site but wasn’t able to find any information on pricing without emailing and possibly adding myself to a marketing list in the process.
numpy. Make a ndarray with your data, len(foo) dtype='uint8' (default?). Then interact with the array of bytes or simply recast your target slice into the format that you want it to be. numpy lets you take raw data, MemoryMaps it, then gives you easy arrays with specified data types. You can shape it if you know the structure too, E.G. (128,8) array of little endian uint64. 
Why is your app different or better than quora? https://quora.com
It appears that you're trying to install it in system Python and you don't have permission to do so. If you posted the command you used, we could know a little more. I would suggest using a tool like [pipenv](http://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to create a separate environment. 
The C API does allow for multiple interpreters, but they all share a single GIL, and compatibility with C extensions is only so-so. (E.g. numpy mostly works in subinterpreters, but there are bugs, and when you hit one you're on your own – it's not a supported configuration.) I would love to see this work, and Eric Smith seems to be trying to make it happen for 3.8, but I've spent quite some time looking at it and realistically I don't think it's doable. Removing the GIL from PyPy is much more plausible, but it's a lot of fiddly work and apparently no companies are interested in funding it.
At is heart, this is "Permission denied" while the current user is writing to `/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/pycodestyle.pyc`. That's where packages are installed by `pip` when using the system-python on OSX. The command you ran *should* have been included in your question. But we can guess that it's something like `pip install autopep8`, and we can see that `autopep8` has a dependency on `pycodestyle`. We don't know what user you ran this command as (but guess it's non-root). We don't know what the permissions are on this directory (but it's normally only writable by the `root` user). Either: * Become root, and do the installation of packages again. * Install the packages in a virtual environment owned by your user.
Thank you.
Thanks for your help!
This is lame haha.
use python 2.7
&gt; It's still LGPL even if you pay for it. Wat? From the Riverbank site: &gt; PyQt is **dual licensed** on all supported platforms under the GNU GPL v3 and the Riverbank Commercial License. **Unlike Qt, PyQt is not available under the LGPL**. If you meant *QT* is still LGPL, well, PyQt wheels ship independent DLLs, which I guess you could swap out if you felt like it. If you want to be more precise, you can build PyQt yourself, I'm sure Riverbank have the experience to support you - which you would be entitled to get, with the commercial license. But as I said, I'm sure there are situations where it would make sense to just license QT as well and simply ship it all closed.
&gt; plain old tkinter Maybe because he doesn't want his app to look like it was made in 1992 ? At least PyQT apps look like what Windows/OSX/GTK/KDE look *today*, not 20 years ago...
I'd kind of like to see some actual numbers for these, not just assumptions...
I'm embarrassed to admit I somehow never noticed I could just run Jupyter Notebooks like that with iPython. Very cool and handy. Thanks!
Those are in the discussions in the python tickets for the issues, linked [here](https://docs.python.org/3.7/whatsnew/3.7.html#optimizations).
Just compare master with 3.6 (or whichever version you're currently using) on here https://speed.python.org/comparison/. Any numbers in the article are based on the performance benchmarks from the original developers which are required for optimization-related changes. As always "actual numbers" are close-to-impossible. Even on speed.python.org you see a 10% speed boost by someone committing to the readme files
you forgot 'path'
Hi OP. I think you forgot to type "path" in front of the !="3". By the way, please check out r/learnpython as well.
Thank you so much !!! It works! I’ll check that out too.
ahhhh thank you so much!!!!
Thanks. That’s also partially why I’m not quite sold on using VirusTotal yet. That might work, I’m still open to other options as well if I have them though...
That would be great please PM links if possible 
The licenses are different for a company and an open source project. For an open source project, saying my program is BSD-3, but the GUI is LGPL isn't a huge deal. Matplotlib, which is BSD-3, supports PyQt (or wxPython or tkinter or PySide) with no problems; matplotlib is not forcing PyQt, so it's fine. It's on the end user. As a company, by default, if you use PyQt, your code is GPL (so now you have to release your source code). If you pay for PyQt, you're much better off and you may dynamically link to PyQt and you don't have to release your source code. That works well on Linux. If you distribute your software as a whl and make customers install PyQt separately, you're also in the clear, but nobody does that (unless you're paying for the source). Most companies prefer to package up executables on Windows and use pyInstaller to make a single file exe. You can't do that under the paid for LGPL license, unless you provide the end user a method for swapping out PyQt versions. Regardless, you still need to provide a method for swapping out the LGPL part of the code.
I've been curious about this before. I was mostly wondering how the sound synthesis would work... I guess there would have to be some kind of python wrapper around a VST.
There's lots of way to do this. Use a list of curse words and compare the string of the song to the list and return true or false. Maybe even regex to search for patterns.
I don’t believe upgrades will break code written for previous minor version releases, so as long as your code was written for Python 3 it should work with any newer version. 
Minor versions (eg. 3.0 -&gt;3.1) break nothing. Major versions (eg. 2.0 j&gt;3.0) break things.
I'm currently self-teaching myself Python through small projects. I used to toy around on the RaspberryPi, but recently installed elementaryOS on an old windows computer of mine. Got a Python environment setup, and have successfully built a Twitter bot that can retweet based on a hashtag search. Perfect for me as I follow several photography and web development feeds. I'd love some feedback and extra additions! [Tweeter](https://github.com/325Designs/tweeter-bot)
Try having a look at BeautifulSoup module. 
the claim was that QT is low-level. it CAN be, but if you don't have to write any c++ in the first place, it's irrelevant what binding library you're using. it would make no difference if it's vanilla qt, ruby qt, python qt, or brainfuck qt (fwiw, this is the python sub, not the pyqt sub)
 import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup # Add as needed. bad_words = ["shit", "cunt", "fuck", "asshole"] # This is used to get around anti scrapers. headers = { "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:58.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/58.0"} def search_lyrics(song_name): # We format the url with our clean query.setattr url = "https://search.azlyrics.com/search.php?q={}".format(song_name) # We first call the search page and get the HTML. with requests.get(url, headers=headers) as search_response: # We turn the HTML into a BeautifulSoup object. search_soup = BeautifulSoup(search_response.text, "html.parser") # The links are laid out in a table and the second 'tr' element holds the first result. first_result = search_soup.find_all("tr")[1].find("a")["href"] # Now we get the lyrics. with requests.get(first_result, headers=headers) as lyrics_response: lyrics_soup = BeautifulSoup(lyrics_response.text, "html.parser") lyrics_text = lyrics_soup.find( "div", {"class": None, "id": None}).text # For exploration you can print the lyrics_text variable. # We now check if the lyrics contain swears using a loop. # We initialize the 'clean' variable as True. clean = True for word in bad_words: # We turn the lyrics to lowercase to improve accuracy. # If there's at least one swear we break the loop and set 'clean' to False. if word in lyrics_text.lower(): clean = False break if clean == False: print("This song contains swearing.") else: print("This song is clean.") # We make the program run in an infinite loop. while True: # We get the song name from the user. song_name = input("Type a song name: ") # If the song name is empty we do nothing and try again, else we start the search. if song_name == "": print("Please type an artist and song name.") else: # Before calling our function, we clean the string. search_lyrics(song_name.replace(" ", "+")) 
Although core devs decided that 4 wouldn't break anything this time
Thanks for the info. Much appreciated!
I understand as someone new to the language why you might feel this way, but upgrades to Python are nothing like language standard updates in other languages like C or C++. As /u/KingofGamesYami mentioned, minor upgrades are guaranteed to not break anything (except maybe unless you were relying on buggy behavior which is ??? at best) and issue important security patches and bug fixes. For instance Python 3.5.2 has a bug [here](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.5.2/Lib/pathlib.py) in the Pathlib library mkdir function related to recursively creating the parent directories, and not passing the exist_ok flag with the recursive call. If you refused to upgrade and always stayed on python 3.5.2 you would ALWAYS have this bug, with no resolution. IF you check the Python 3.6 version of this function (or subsequent versions of 3.5) [here](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.6/Lib/pathlib.py) you can see the issue has been fixed. . It now correctly passes along the exist_ok argument. This is just one concrete example. You really should be using the most recent version of Python that you can unless you _know_ you can't for some reason. 
&gt; You can't do that under the paid for LGPL license Wat? There is no such thing. They explicitly say pyqt is NOT LGPL. It’s literally [right there on the first page. ](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) The only bit of LGPL would be QT itself, and as I said that part is shipped as DLLs by default. As long as you package it in the same way, there should be no issue. 
Yeah sorry, I just follow both subs ;) I agree to your point, but my point is still valid: it’s a python sub, there are python bindings, python is most certainly not low level, so recommending js or qml just looks weird.
I've read about some breaking changes in the 3.7 library changelog. Things that you'll need to import from __future__ in 3.7 but will become default in 4.0.
Python doesn't use semantic versikoning, so sometimes things break on a minor release. AFAIR, str and bytes was somewhat unstable from 3.0 to 3.3.
Your IDE might be configured to use a different Python interpreter/environment.
IIRC there are 3 issues with that, in CPython (though one is not cpyhton-speciifc): 1. The refcount is part of the object layout, so any object you touch gets faulted 2. The GC generates a doubly-linked list of object, that list is intrusive, meaning [even for objects you do not touch, on the first GC pass the object gets faulted](https://engineering.instagram.com/dismissing-python-garbage-collection-at-instagram-4dca40b29172). [Python 3.7 has grown an API to opt objects out of GC entirely](https://engineering.instagram.com/copy-on-write-friendly-python-garbage-collection-ad6ed5233ddf) but by default the issue remains.
Personally, I don't feel right to downvote a comment just because you disagree with a particular view. Is the comment unconstructive? I don't think so. The person states he/she is new and asked an appropriate question on regarding scripts breaking on new updates.
I can help you on this. what's the challenge you are facing right now?
Yeah, I thought that too and I wrote a test.py to show the version and the path of it. It shows that the python is the same as what I used in python console. import sys print(sys.path) print(sys.version) C:\Users\experiment\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35\python.exe "E:/pythonCode/image recognition/matploblib/python_version.py" ['E:\\pythonCode\\image recognition\\matploblib', 'E:\\pythonCode', 'C:\\Users\\experiment\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python35\\python35.zip', 'C:\\Users\\experiment\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python35\\DLLs', 'C:\\Users\\experiment\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python35\\lib', 'C:\\Users\\experiment\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python35', 'C:\\Users\\experiment\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python35\\lib\\site-packages'] 3.5.2 (v3.5.2:4def2a2901a5, Jun 25 2016, 22:18:55) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)]
Did you, by any chance, save your file as `matplotlib.py`? Because if you did, Python will try to import that file instead of the `matplotlib` package.
Oh my god! How stupid I am! Thank you for your help! Now it works.
The rules are that things can break on minor releases, but depreciation warnings must be raised for two version prior on minor elements and __future__ imports for two versions prior for major elements. 
So you're saying you want to [Automate the Boring Stuff With Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)?
Yes I have done few thing in PHP , and also in python basic operation on CSV files other then nothing.
it won't be static data , First I have to get data from Stock Trading Terminal which Provide RTD feature ....so using that need to get all data first and calculate Implied Volatility and that plot it live as price changes..
Looks doable with a bit of work.
It's not even pep8, it's consistency.. I can live with non-pep8 yet consistent style.
Thanks for your feedback. I completely agree with the fact that it is the backend which does all the heavy lifting. It can also be safely assumed that all the complexity is with the backend most of times. However, in my case, frontend wasn't a design oriented system. At times, it also had to handle some business logic too. And in our team, frontend was usually our Android apps which were pretty bulky feature-wise.
Yes, absolutely. Read the book, it explains that sort of thing well.
I was focused on Flask as mentioned by OP. Electron apps aren't web apps, but fair enough.
The advantage of python readability over shellscript and everything that comes from that.
Awesome, thanks for the feedback! Ordering it now!
MultiAV has a list of engines that all have a commandline version: https://github.com/joxeankoret/multiav 
Perhaps instead of 3.9 they want to go to 4 instead of 3.10. I think that was Guido's logic at least
Unfortunately the only answer to this is "it depends"! More specifically, it will depend on the kind of workload you have, the natural size of the pieces it can be broken up into, data formats, CPU/RAM/IO balances (both workload and hardware), and much more. I do have some general advice though: - There are probably expert staff running the cluster - see if you can get a ~hour meeting with them to discuss your specific workload. They probably won't (can't) help with code or suggesting tools, but it's a fantastic way to learn more about what tradeoffs you should be considering. - If you are on a cluster, you have lots of things that can go wrong. Think about how to run checkpointable jobs, so you can restart (close to) where you left off when something crashed. - Live systems are harder than batch processing. Do the latter if you can. - Get used to "directed acyclic graphs" - most of you tasks can probably be represented like this, and it's a great perspective for thinking about automating, dependencies, and bottlenecks. - Pure functions and immutable structures are fantastic for clear and correct code. Use them where you can, but it's often worth writing the "core" (small, expensive bit) in a more efficient style whatever the cost. Profile, don't guess! If you can tell us the general field and kind of task you have, I'll be able to provide some more useful links :-)
I suppose it'd be kind of silly to expect JIT compilation/optimization or removal of the GIL at this point or something. ;-)
I see. And while it makes some sense, and is definitely nicer, I think major release with no major changes would be somewhat confusing. Less thank 3.10 would (it's obvious one shouldn't compare it as decimals when you have releases in the form of x.x.x)
That will cost you 50$ per hour, minimum 1 hour or /r/DoMyHomework/
Why are you going to the school? It costs a ton of time and money but if you're not doing your own homework then you'll never learn the things you're supposed to. 
Your target audience are lazy students in a panic before exams? Lol ok. They also have the least money. I've actually been in that situation myself and irc was fine 
No. It depends on what’s going on. There’s a project where the back end is now done and the front end has yet to start. If the project is planned well, it shouldn’t matter. The two tiers should know how to talk to each other, minor changes only. 
I'm not sure if i quite get your question but how about you just use a function that does whatever you want, and then call it where you need it? It can't be that simple can it? :D
&gt; getting access to a computer cluster Anything more specific then this? Who runs this cluster? I'd ask for some more info what kind of work of job management they use. What do you supply and what do you get back?
I think it is very hard to generalize on this topic. If you say backend constantly missed their deadlines then I'd have a good look at what was to be implemented during the time leading to the deadline. You should have some kind of buffer for your work that should allow for slow progress or delays to happen without being behind schedule. Are the things you had to implement too big or was it just too much? Have you been involved in planning somehow (i.e. by being give an estimatation on required time)? Did you start into the next round of development with already being delayed because you needed to finish whatever you were doing before the deadline? When you write that backend devs _are always loaded with something_ this sound to me like maybe they are doing too much. From my look I'd say you should talk to your manager here and figure out how things can be improved.
I do all of my homework and overall have very good grades at school. This task is a pre-release material for a very important exam (igcse). I don't really feel comfortable with it and I am afraid that if I do it wrong then I will fail the whole exam.

This question is better-suited to /r/learnpython. This is a limitation of doing everything with a gigantic, flat tree of if statements. It's not a limitation of the language. There are lots of different ways that you can structure your code using functions or objects or both which lets you define each "area" in the story in one place and link them together efficiently. I suggest that you repost this question in /r/learnpython, and include a link to a pastebin with your actual code. Then people will be able to make specific suggestions.
I think I heard in a podcast at some point that there is some really integral part to Python that makes removing the GIL all but impossible. 
Unfortunately I don't yet know who runs the cluster or what kind of machines etc. The university is in the process of acquiring it, it doesn't have it yet. from other comment: &gt;this is a chemistry calculation-- given a direction of symmetry, we use an algorithm to build a possible permutation of the molecule's atoms and then calculate the symmetry measure. the part being parallelized is the calculation-per-direction, given an array of directions. at the barest minimum we'd need to be able to pass the molecule class, some additional calculation information, and the direction... &gt;we get back a result class. if needed, we could get back an ordered tuple instead.
thank you, this is very helpful. this is a chemistry calculation-- given a direction of symmetry, we use an algorithm to build a possible permutation of the molecule's atoms and then calculate the symmetry measure. the part being parallelized is the calculation-per-direction, given an array of directions. at the barest minimum we'd need to be able to pass the molecule, some additional calculation information, and the direction... we get back a result class. if needed, we could get back an ordered tuple instead.
Please ask questions like this in /r/learnpython. Except not literally this exact question, which really looks like a zero-effort attempt to get someone to do your homework for you. You haven't even told us which of these tasks you want help with (or if it's all three). Which parts do you need help with? Which parts don't you understand? Which parts *do* you understand? Can you describe in words how you think you should approach this problem? What is your level of experience in Python? Have you written any code to attempt to solve this? If you have, show us the code. If you haven't, make an attempt.
You can look at Holoviews which work well for live data stream, or Plotly (I have a preference for the first one, but a lot of people enjoy the latter as well, so it's up to you :)).
I have no idea about dash itself, I haven't used it, but as it's a web app platform it'll be some sort of CSS modification you're after, I assume if you look at the dev tools in your browser you'll be able to find the parent div and set the background colour with css? https://community.plot.ly/t/how-do-i-use-dash-to-add-local-css/4914/15
It's an interesting idea, but there are a few things off the top of my head to think about. Would you charge for this service? If so would it be funded by people buying it from the app store? What happens when you reach saturation, no more money coming in but you still need to run the servers. How much would you charge? How would you market it? Also a minor issue. People, in general, don't like talking to random strangers on the phone, so that would need to be optional. It would be a hard sell especially when things like Quora or specialist forums/subreddits/irc/slack/gitter channels already exist and are all free. Good luck though! 
I can agree with your statement that the question seems too broad. I just wanted to know whether the situation is same across companies. Yes, I was involved while giving estimations along with other team members. But it happened many times that I underestimated the depth of the requirement because of which a lot of "surprise" work popped up in between. Second major reason being dealing with legacy code. And finally, yes, sometimes it just exceeded the deadlines for no reason (sorry, just can't explain why, but even I never understood where I missed my deadlines). It should also be noted that the companies that I had worked with were all startups, which meant unclear features, little to no time in planning, fast development and deployment. However, this was not limited to backend developers but rather everyone in the engineering team. Still only backend suffered.
Have you looked here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lyricsmaster/2.7.9 There are lots of similar packages on pypi. 
The trading terminal I am using can send stock Quotes (Live) to Excel using RTD feature Or If One RTD client then can access that data directly. So I have two choices i ) Get data Directly from Terminal in Python if anyone created Python RTD client ii) If not then First get that Live data in Excel ( which I know how) , then from Excel to Python. The data in Excel will get update Live. 
Was hoping to learn how to use scratch for data science
1. You'll have to look for a client yourself… or you could look at its documentation, if any, or try to reverse engineer it. A bit of networking knowledge, a bit of `nmap` and `wireshark` or other may help. Out of scope of this subreddit. 2. Not sure if `xlwings` will see the changes. You'll have to look at that yourself.
You'll get downvoted less often if you don't call people numpties, regardless of whether you think they deserve it.
that plotting Part I think will be Easy compare to getting Live Data from Stock trading Terminal. To get Live data there is two option 1) Terminal to Excel ( using RTD feature) then to Python 2) If any RTD client avaliable in Python then terminal to python Directly. Is there ? 
I have no interest in being up or down voted, as the votes are not necessarily handed out by professional programmers, all that bothers me on any Python forum are facts.
It's the opposite where I work, the Android/iOS development always lags behind, we have missed many client deadlines waiting on the mobile app team. They recently started migrating all of the apps to Xamarin to try and speed up the development process (and get Windows Apps at the same time)
Fair enough, but you may have misinterpreted it as disagreement. You tended to receive downvotes and combative replies on /r/learnpython because you were rude to people.
Is getting the data into excel part of a process, whether business or personal, or is that something that you perceive as easy to do, or what? Perhaps to answer my own question are you thinking of using something like [MARKET.RTD](https://www.stock-data-solutions.com/docs/marketrtd.htm)?
Yes, part of Process if I can not find a solution to get data directly in python then have to get it done through Excel. 
okay got it. There are few who done regarding this..like [pyrtd](https://github.com/brotchie/pyrtd) **and** [pywin32](https://github.com/SublimeText/Pywin32/blob/master/lib/x32/win32com/demos/excelRTDServer.py) but it is not maintained nd not sure working properly
[Permanent](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-permanent-links-to-files/#press-y-to-permalink-to-a-file-in-a-specific-commit) GitHub links: * [SublimeText/Pywin32/.../**excelRTDServer.py** (master → 753322f)](https://github.com/SublimeText/Pywin32/blob/753322f9ac4b943c2c04ddd88605e68bc742dbb4/lib/x32/win32com/demos/excelRTDServer.py) ---- [^delete](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=GitHubPermalinkBot&amp;subject=deletion&amp;message=Delete reply du4nn8o.)
Other one is this. [pywin32](https://github.com/SublimeText/Pywin32/blob/master/lib/x32/win32com/demos/excelRTDServer.py) thnks for other links...will check ..otherwise will try to get it from Excel to Python then plotting nd all. 
Some changes between minor versions do break backwards compatibility but have had to go through a deprecation cycle first. Thankfully these are relatively few and far between.
No, all the big changes in str and bytes were in the transition from 2 to 3. Perhaps you're thinking of the [Flexible String Representation](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0393/) which was introduced in 3.3?
&lt;spits out coffee&gt; Oh gawd that would be a painful, painful exercise.
And before I forget one noticeable difference nowadays is that the core devs can change anything that they like, even in a patch update, if a library is marked as provisional.
As I've said I don't give a crap about up or down votes, I will correct poor or wrong advice, regardless of the forum that it's on, end of story. If you (plural) don't know what you're talking about, don't bloody well post!!!
Ah, yes, i looked at that and it would work fine for me.... except I can’t find actual download links for the engine and it doesn’t appear that he packages the engines in his code, I think they have to be preinstalled, which leads me back to the issue of where to actually download said engines... Unless I missed something.
Thanks (hah)! This is really cool. It's nice to be able to support creators, but it's also nice as just a tool to figure out who is behind the code you're using.
Does Python support self referential statements? Sorry, I'm new.
No, that's not it. The closest I can get to what I still have hovering in the back of my mind is 3.3 that re-introduce the u' notation. It might be that it was removed as no longer needed, because of the genereal changes to str, but later added again for compatibility with 2.x. It just doesn't fit that black spot in my mind. 
Works like an absolute charm. Does exactly what I need. Thank you so much. I am also taking other comments into consideration and seeing about doing more with this.
# Calling methods faster (maybe) Python 3.7 adds 2 new Opcodes, `LOAD_METHOD` and `CALL_METHOD` # `str.find()` ... faster for [certain unicode characters] [For certain unicode characters, str.find is] 3x slower than ASCII characters instead of 25x! # os.fwalk is 2x faster [than before] # Regular expressions... faster for case-insensitive matching ...if you’re matching ASCII characters you can see up to a 20x improvements in matching time 
*Python Ensembles* in this context mean ensembles in the machine learning sense within python.
For me, the real wins of a "real programming language" (i.e. a highly predictable one with easy-to-detect errors) come when you start doing anything "programmatic" (e.g. maths or more-than-simple logic) or when you start getting data that can have nasty edge cases (rather than predictable one off tasks). 
I think you will find a lot of people saying that it's the same but also a lot of people saying it's the other way round. From my work I could tell many stories where the frontend was lagging and as much where the backend was too slow. Good news first: you know what is slowing you down. So how can you fix it? The _surprise work_ is probably unplannable up front and I'd guess that this is nothing that can easily be postponed. If it is postponable it can usually be planned for and this should go to the managing person to plan this in accordingly. If your legacy code is constantly slowing you down than try to fix this. There is a good changce that it is not affecting only you but also your co-workers. I think it's the duty of management to make time for fixing this. Sure it's usually nothing that brings immediate value but you will be faster to develop with the codebase and you will feel more confident. Avoiding to improve an old codebase will lead to technical debt that will surely slow you down more in the long than you would have needed to spend to improve it. My advise is identify the problems you have with the legacy codebase and talk with management to try to improve things step by step. Sometimes in our professional life we probably have missed a deadline. You, me, the person next to us, we all have and we probably all will again sooner or later. The thing is that this shouldn't be the norm. The more complex, the more unknown something that should be developed is the more likely are the chances that a deadline will be missed. This is one of the reasons for small iterations in agile software development: try to break the big and impossible task into many smaller and easy to work tasks. What are you even developing if you are developing _unclear features_? And nearly no planning? Sounds a lot like a headless development department. Do you at least have any kind of direction or guidance on what to work on? Again I'd suggest talking to people over it. If you say startup the chances are good that you can grab your CTO and have a chat about how things are.
Oh yah for sure. A particular task I had recently was doing a huge data processing/filtering run (on the order of a billion rows of data). One of our R&amp;D engineers was trying to do it with grep/awk. Worked pretty well up to a point, and then he was looking at tens of hours per file, and several days to complete all of them. I reworked it in python and figured out a few optimizations and in our particular case it turned out that grep was really really slow; it doesn't do very well when your list of patterns to check is in the hundreds or thousands. Few hours later I had it down to under 10 minutes per file.
Well FTR here's the PEP for the u' notation change [Explicit Unicode Literal for Python 3.3](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0414/).
Good writeup. I recently started using Cython and am a big fan: it really bridges the gap between C and python in a unique way. The main trouble I've had with cython is for certain expressions understanding whether they will behave "the C way" or "the python way", especially since there is some hidden pointer magic going on when you use python objects from cython. The learning curve for cython is a bit rough, but since valid python code is typically also valid cython code, you can get started right away even if you've only learned the very basics.
Wheel tutorial: Make it round. Thanks y'all leave a comment and share it with your friends!
Don't let the women hear you think "clitoris" is a swear word!
Have you tried reporting tool? It helps a lot. http://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/quickstart/cythonize.html#determining-where-to-add-types
Take a look at Celery as a substitute for multiprocessing, across machines.
&gt; Html and css slapped togheter I work mostly on back and front equally. Each feature is mostly done alone by myself. I put a lot more thinking into the backend, but still try to KISS. That said, my frontend code is usually very complex (becuase of business requirements) and its not ”slapped togheter” in any way. It depends. Sometimes i write more logic on the client, sometimes more on the backend. Depending totally in how i see it is done best. Html/css is really not where the time goes, its more in javascript and business flow, teying to make the most easy and intuitive UI possible. Frontend is (to me) very important, becuase that was the user sees. The user does not really care about the backend becuase it transparent. Id say backend code probably is slower in the sense that its more business critical, and frontend can be built using some patterns used in the app. 
Not yet - I've still got high-level logic bugs in my code to worry about at the moment. I did spot-check the generated C code to see that it matched my expectations but I'll give the reporting tool a try when the program is closer to completion.
This is something you will get used to. Its very rare this causes a bug, because after all most langugaes have a concept of scope. A good practice is to give new names to ”result” container like variables. Or simple return the computation of some variables, no need to even reassign! The takeaway is, ALWAYS try to avoid global mutable state. 
Yep! you can still reassign (or bind as elixir folks like to call it) though :)
I second the mpi4py comment below. If you haven't done any MPI programming before, it's a bit obtuse at first, but it should be able to do what you need quite well once you understand how to do the message passing portion (send, recv, broadcast, scatter, gather, etc). 
LUA!!!
If I breakpoint inside a class, the inline value has a tendency to just show me the value of "self" when references an instance variable. Any way to fix this?
That was a very interesting read. Well done, sir. 
No idea, but I would try adding a repr o str method to the class, that might work
I must say i really like Erlangs concurrency model to Gos. The mailbox system Erlang uses is very pragmatic, and with the best pattern matching (imho) system available its a nice and consistent way to do massive concurrency. Gos gorutines are less verbose, but its rare one just spawns (erlangs version of a goroutine) a process manually. The power comes from the OTP framework. In go error handling is a massive pain, contrast in Erlang errors are handled very differently, and the motto ”let it crash” is really a nice way to manage process state and failure.
it's a python sub, yes, but that doesn't mean other topics can't be discussed. the initial claim was about QT's low-level nature. python, as a language, is high-level, but when purely using the pyqt bindings, you are using python in a low-level manner. Using QML + Javascript is higher level in this regard
This release includes built-in support for Basic Auth and some improvements in the middleware architecture. Checkout [the release notes on GitHub](https://github.com/prkumar/uplink/releases/tag/v0.4.0) for what's new.
Top of my head, use the to_datetime. https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.to_datetime.html
Seems like "fucker" should be in there somewhere.
Are you sure these aren't just the top words?
Cool. Did you use the screenplay, or speech recognition or something? I think your Y axis shouldn't be 'frequency' but 'amount of times used in the movie', as frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit of time. 
Hm. Clitoris isn't a swear word... Neither is sucking? Perhaps not even cock depending on the context... 
It depends on what your exact goal is. If you want to do some work for an audio application you're likely not going to want to implement any of the audio processing in python as [realtime audio waits for nothing](http://www.rossbencina.com/code/real-time-audio-programming-101-time-waits-for-nothing) and python will occasional pause execution. For realtime audio you'll want to use a lower level language with zero garbage collection (e.g. C, C++, rust, etc). Having the GUI in python however should still be reasonable. The [Carla](https://github.com/falkTX/Carla) plugin host uses PyQt4/5 for the GUI and C++ for the audio processing. I'd recommend checking out the Linux audio community as there have been a few FLOSS audio apps there which have leveraged python in the past.
You forgot Barbara Streisand!
This is pretty damn awesome. How can we do this? Can we take a look at the code or is this very sensitive information. Thank you.
Can we see the code?
This. Alternatively you may use the stemming package .)
I'm not sure I agree- It's very common practice (especially in statistics) to use frequency to mean number of times something occurs in a sample.
Seconding this. This is the de facto approach to distributed computing. Most of the patterns used in multithreading can be realized with OpenMPI. Especially nice: it will manage architecture-specific details like word size and endianness for you.
This is science I can get behind

If it is a distributed memory cluster, you're going to want to use MPI as others have said. If you're using concurrent.futures to make execution pools for local multiprocessing, check out mpi4py provides a similar interface that I've been able to use very successfully (https://mpi4py.scipy.org/docs/usrman/mpi4py.futures.html).
Could you show me how you did this, or link me to your code?
I'm more interested in the code than the site. Care to share?
Jython didn't have one. (Not that I'm trying to compare its performance with CPython's; just that it's quite possible to have a Python interpreter without a GIL.)
Im not ready with the code stucture. I want to cut the scrape part from the web app and upload it on github. I think its better for maybe other people to use it. I plan something like an unoffical 4chan API. 
Wow! This needs more attention! 
That would definitely work as well. Just that I wanted to be self-contained from Windows. 
That was something along those lines I was thinking. The issue is though, that I do call to_datetime() on strings like "Total" and that makes an error. Maybe that is solvable with a try statement.
I've been looking forward to implement elasticsearch in my Django site. Do you have a post or guide that could help me?
And clitoris 
Over to the right on the sidebar, there are a bunch of links. Also /r/learnpython
The most interesting thing to come out of this is that you think sucking and clitoris are bad words.
Oh my god, now we have to flag this whole thread as NSFW.
and bastards!
Well, it's per running length of the movie in this case.
Ok, maybe that's due to English not being my native language. I thought frequency would need a repeating factor.
I'd go with `occurences` there.
It wasn't. If I recall, Stan was on a journey to find 'the clitoris' to satisfy Wendy, because Chef taught the kids that's how you please a woman. Or something like that.
Did you use voice-to-text for this or something more advanced?
It depends on what features your calendar system needs. You should be okay with knowing a few common things, though; read up on lists, dictionaries, the `time` and `math` modules and the modulus (`%`)-operator
Working on a small application that will help me get a Tetris achievement on the Xbox. The achievement requires getting a 20 Combo (breaking 21 rows in a row). There are 10 "columns" in Tetris, and the strategy is to perfectly fill up the 3 columns closest to each wall and then go for the combo in the 4 remaining middle columns. The only reason this is achievable is that the game allows the player to see the next 4 game pieces, and the ability to save a piece for later. I'm writing code to brute force the building of the walls and then the combo. I already had a Tetris engine coded from a past project, so I don't have to waste time on that. I Incorporated the game into a GUI with entry fields so I can tell it what pieces are coming up next. The project is going "okay". I'm guessing I have about 10-20 hours of coding before I can go for the achievement.
Use the errors argument. If ‘coerce’, then invalid parsing will be set as NaT 
Step 1: read the sidebar Step 2: /r/learnpython Step 3: read THAT sidebar Step 4: format your code so we can read it (add 4 spaces before each line)
There's a [built-in](https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.path.html#os.path.splitext) command to get the extension. This should probably be posted in /r/learnpython instead of here, by the way. You should also clean up your post formatting so it is easier to read. 
Ah I also spent some time trying to get a Keras model to work with CoreML. It was pretty brutal because I had a lot of preprocessing and other logic i was doing in the script with the model, but you cant really export that. I'm also not a mobile developer so it ended up being pretty rough trying to get a prototype going.
Yeah, saw that above. Formatting's being a pain in the butt, put four spaces in front of each line and for some reason it's not accepting it. I'll retry in learnpython. Thanks :)
This is a question more appropriate for [r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/), but basically what you want to do is: for thing in list: if condition(thing): return True return False That way you get True it *any* of the items in the list satisfy the condition, and False if **all** of them do not. Also, while you're at it, you might want to look up either **os.path.splitext** or **pathlib.Path.suffix** for getting your file extension ... splitting on spaces and taking index 1 can be a problem with things like .tar.gz files, among other examples.
Yeah stan was like "chef how do you please a woman" and chef was like "you just gotta find the clitoris.... OOPS MOVE ALONG CHILDREN"
Worked perfectly, thank you. And for now I'm not worried about double . extensions, I know I'll only be working with single .
Yeah. Considering one of the most common phrases in the movie is: “Shut your fucking face uncle fucker. You’re a boner biting bastard uncle fucker.”
Bit of a stretch, maybe, and I'm going out on a limb here, but you *could* install a C++ compiler?? Looking at the Theano source code mingw-w64 should do.
maybe hug of death? :)
and bitch ok dogs dont normally appear too often in southpark
Not here to talk about what a swear word is. Interested in how you did it though. 
even bitch doesnt have to be a swear word. maybe op should extract the number of female dogs too
Can you run this program against all 11 current seasons of Trailer Park Boys and see how many times the word fuck is sad. im guessing around 5000 times
No. There is no breaking 4.0 release planned currently.
No. There is no breaking 4.0 release planned currently.
heh i used to do this back in the day, although i used ms word and ctrl+f with the scripts. 
top comments are so nit picky, it is south park it is a pretty good assumption they are used as a swear word
You know, it's pretty easy to keep abreast of changes: all of it is public, generally on the python-dev mailing list and/or as PEPs. The only recent mentions I can find of an eventual 4.0 on the ML is a bloke saying they're still porting from 2 to 3 and asking if there's going to be as large an upheaval, the various responses being: &gt; At this point, Python 4 is just a convenient tag for really big changes. (Ned Deily, who I think is the RM for 3.7?) -- &gt; No. Guido has gone on record as saying this won't happen. (Paul Moore) -- &gt; Emphatically no. Anyone suggesting big breaking changes in 4.0 is exercising wishful thinking :) &gt; There may be some cleanup in 4.0, but only removing things that have been deprecated for a long time in 3.x but hadn't been removed to maintain compatibility with 2.7. (Zachary Ware) — &gt; Guido has repeatedly promised that there will never be another upheaval as big as the 2-to-3 one, and that the change from Python 3.9 to 4.0 won't be anything special. Hopefully we can trust him on that. (Greg Ewing) So: * no, 4.0 will not be following 3.7 * no, 4.0 won't be an upheaval similar to 3.0, it should be similar to [2.0](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.0/#news)
&gt; clitoris bastards sucking cock
I mean it's literally the scientific term for that part of the female anatomy. By no means is it a swear word. 
If I had to guess I’d say he got the transcript, split on white space, and counted the swear words from a predefined list that he made. 
I think he was referring to cock
I'm not saying this is feasible or even sensible, but couldn't you write an efficient python module in C and that would increase the speed? Maybe that's just reinventing the wheel because of tools that already exist. I think the original point is that the advantage is you're working with a cleaner and easier syntax of python which is familiar instead of having to learn bash's syntax. I've heard a saying in the Javascript community "Javascript everywhere" because with things like node now they aren't just limited to client-side browser programming. I think a similar philosophy and desire exists within the python community to have "Python everywhere".
Sure of course you could. But someone could also probably rewrite it in Javascript and be faster too if they were really good. (Also I can cut the operation time down to about 5 minutes in total by using Pandas, but did not have it available in this environment) My point was not that C/c++ is bad. It was that sometimes a writing things in python is good and sometimes you should just stick to the command line tools because they are very good at what they for.
I am not sure whether that would solve your problem but have you heard of https://freeboard.io/. I hope it helps.
Whatever, clitface.
And cock
Hmm, quite different to my experience with earth observation sorry! That means no useful links, but a final tip: Can you break up the job into independent sub-tasks? eg pass the molecule, and "you check permutations 10K -- 12K and pass back an array of results". If so, each chunk could checkpoint on completion, and you have one master process aggregating results - much easier to reason about and optimise. Just remember: PROFILE, DON'T GUESS. Re: raw performance, it really depends. Use the `attrs` library if you're sticking with classes; consider `typing.NamedTuple` on Python 3.6+, consider Pandas dataframes if you can aggregate results.
Needs to be an actual development tool, the end-user won't have internet access.
You missed "Barbara Streisand".
Elegant, appreciative and pythonic. This is just awesome! 
This is a very cool project, thanks! 
Wait...so you went to the trouble of writing a Python script to extract the frequency certain words within the movie script, compiled them, exported it as a csv...just to plot it in Excel?
I haven't done any windows automation with python in several years, but my first thought was... Are you sure you're using the right language? There's other languages built around automating Windows...see AutoIT.
You're being downvoted because people are too lazy to tell you to read the rules.
Raised Christian. Have a nice fucking day!
Ah thanks! RTFM eh ;) I was on the fence since I'm not looking for beginner/homework-style code. I'll repost over on learning.
Does you application have foreground when you run it? Windows prevents any application except for the current foreground application from making some other window the foreground window.
I’m actually shocked that “clitoris” is used more than half as much as “bitch”.
Well, I'm sure they arent. Some of the most common words in english aren't included on the list. What OP did was choose certain words to search for and count how often they appear. It would be interesting to see a more conclusive list of words.
7 occurances
I am still not sure exactly how to save the handle to a variable so I can pass it to win32gui.BringWindowToTop and win32gui.SetForegroundWindow. I want to be able to save the handle to a variable so I can use win32gui.SetForgroundWindow(notepad[0]). I tried using this def enum_window_callback(hwnd, pid): tid, current_pid = win32process.GetWindowThreadProcessId(hwnd) if pid == current_pid and win32gui.IsWindowVisible(hwnd): windows.append(hwnd)
Yeah. I think it kind of depends on how familiar you are with bash scripting's syntax. And javascript being faster than C/++ ? That seems weird. I know the V8 is really well built and you can do webassembly (which I guess is like doing C/++ anyways) but I would assume that C/++ would always have the speed advantage over Javascript. Or maybe I'm overestimating the speed of using a C/++ module in Python compared to Javascript.
Yes. It depends on what these several functions are. You provided a generic question with no discussion of what your function does/outputs, so beyond a simple yes/no, I can't help answer how. Also /r/learnpython
Working on my first Python project (I'm learning web development). I'm hoping to use the Pillow library to create a basic web app that will let me make slideshows and collages for travel photos.

Barbara Streisand: 1
Just FYI if you only have one item in a bar chart you don't need a legend. :)
You're right. The function i inserted is called I a for loop. The functions take the number of bottles that were turned into a site on a particular day and multiply them by .10. I'm trying to get the sum of bottles*.10 and add them together. I can return this value but don't understand how the syntax should be. Would I add the function and their arguments together, is the return put I a diff var then add all those? 
And not *mother fucker* apparently ...
This is true! Didn't think of that one! 
Still not "clitoris".. 
I am very interested in gaining more job skills that use SQL and a minimal mix of something like Python. I generally hate programming and don't want to be debugging even 20% of my day.

Like this? Code is worth a 1000 words. summed_value = sum([friday_bottles(number_of_bottles)*0.1 for number_of_bottles in number_of_bottles_list]) That's shorthand for: values = [] for number_of_bottles in number_of_bottles_list: value = friday_bottles(number_of_bottles)*0.1 values.append(value) summed_value = sum(values)

I don't think there are many computers in the world that can computer vision analysis on every single square meter of the whole US.
As X approaches 0 you're basically asking OpenCV's detector to have sub pixel precision. I don't know how OpenCV works but it could be a pure and simple aliasing artifact that, when combined with the latency with activation of the servo, causes the wobble. Maybe try dithering or a simple gaussian blur on the input before passing to OpenCV? Is there any way you can measure the latency between your app and the servo and add a queue that buffers for exactly that long before issuing an update?

Maybe try dithering or a simple gaussian blur on the input before passing to OpenCV? There's also an input lag factor here. Camera -&gt; your app -&gt; servo movement takes time, some latency, and adding a buffer that sends say the average of the last X suggested updates to the servo may be useful (a windowing function)
As X approaches 200 you're basically asking OpenCV's detector to have sub pixel precision. This could be a pure and simple aliasing artifact. Maybe try dithering or a simple gaussian blur on the input before passing to OpenCV? Also there's an input lag factor at work here too, a latency between the camera, your app, the io for issuing an update to the servo, and actual servo movement. Maybe buffer N updates and only send the mean of the last N updates - a windowing function
If you had a pretrained image classifier, and just moved Google Maps a certain amount, ran the classifier, then repeated?
Might be true. But in most cases, however, the planning wasn't sloppy, as such. Though I can accept that it wasn't very thorough either.
At the time this was produced I would say bastards was a "bad word" for TV.
Two years ago my employer hired some schmuck freelancer to cobble together what amounts to an IoT management platform using ansible, python, and AWS services. Between a messy specification and the coder's own learning curve, they made a mess. Now they've brought me on full time and, along with the day-to-day Network Engineering, I have to go back and operationalize this thing, and I'm constantly shocked at the nonsense I find. The surprise twist being, of course, that the freelance schmuck was *ME ALL ALONG!*. 
Then you know what to do next. Find out which steps took longer than planning stage estimates. ;)
Wow! I can relate to almost everything you spoke of. Working in a fast paced startup leaves little time for refactoring old code as long as things *work*. I think it's time for us to prioritize cleaning up technical debt. Just curious, do you guys have a strict coding guidelines? And does that actually help? I was always told that developers should be given creative independence when writing code and enforcing guidelines inhibits that. Your insight really helped. I will share this with my colleagues too. Thanks a lot!

Thanks for your feedback. This is strange for me that Android lags behind in your team! Though not my domain, how does Xamarin compare to Kotlin/Java in terms of development speed? Anything in particular that improved your development speed? Was it really significant?

You made a word counting program 🤗
I think it is just the developers, they just seem slower! They never tried Kotlin, they went straight from Java/Objective-C to Xamarin. It seems to me from the outside that the initial development using Xamarin is slower and quite awkward, messing with a different edge case for each platform for each problem, but I can see the advantage of havng a 1 app in the long term.
Writing it up as we speak with a little github code to accompany it.
How about you also skip any filenames that start with `.` when you write your list comprehension?
copy pasting someone's content without providing a source: not cool.
See an earlier comment.
You're welcome! Hope things will get better for you :) We have coding guidelines. This is on one hand mostly following pep8 with some exceptions. We are not strictly enforcing these rules and each component may define their own set of rules - altough this is only very rarely done. Our CI runs flake8 / pylint to see if they are followed and make it easy for a developer to improve her code - most IDEs are able to do this aswell. I tend to focus on writing code along with tests to meet the functionality first in whatever style I like and then spend some time to meet the guidelines - good tests help in making this a very painless experience. Besides code formatting we have some guidelines as to what things to avoid and what to do instead (in the likes of "avoid _range(len(...))_ and use _enumerate_ instead"). For me the most important aspect is that your code should be easy to read and good to understand. This can often be improved by being consistent with a consistent writing style. If you are up for some reading I'd suggest getting a copy of _Martin Fowler - Refactoring_ and _Robert Martin - Working Effectively with Legacy Code_.

Hello, whats all this then? Going to explore it!

Oh yeah sorry, I did import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
It’s not hysteresis. Hysteresis would be if you had a tracking algorithm that tracked one face, but you presented it with two faces and it switched between which face it was tracking based on some movements. What you’re more or less doing now is tracking noise; be it jitter, optical distortion effect or numerical artefacts. At minimum you need a filter. Something to smooth the signal out. I’d look at a moving average filter to start with and go from there. That is; instead of using the last position, use the arithmetic average of the last N positions. The larger the N, the smoother the movement, but the less responsive the tracking. There are more sophisticated approaches if your math is good and you’ve got the time to read about control systems engineering

Your chart doesn't make any sense, you have time in both X and Y, how does that work? Are you spending less time now, as per the X axis, or WAY more time as per the Y axis. 
Wait what?
X is the timeline, Y is the amount of time wasted doing xkcd charts, maybe in hours or minutes, who knows.
Hi Mate, I have talked to you before as you have helped me ever so kindly with some coding for my school. As part of our IST course in yr 9/10 there is a python module to it. I have students participating in a GROK learning python challenge and the STARLAB mars rover challenge. I was wondering if you have any information/resources available which would let them have a go creating a game of their own. I have a wide variety of coding skills in the class, from complete noobs to a yr 9 student who is writing his own compiler/language and using python to make a checklist program which adhere to design constraints of an F1 car (over 64 pages of rules and tolerances) Cheers - absolutely love what you do!

*Beep boop* I am a bot that sniffs out spammers, and this smells like spam. At least 100.0% out of the 2 submissions from /u/harperterp appear to be for Udemy affiliate links. Don't let spam take over Reddit! Throw it out! *Bee bop*
...what. What is your end goal here?
While you can skip names starting with a period by adding a negated x.startswith('.') to the filter part of the list comprehension, IMO it would be one notch up to instead add a conditional that checks that the filename ends with .png (if that is expected).
The lib isn't quite production ready, and I'm working on the docs and other use cases to cover. But any review would be welcome ^_^

Awesome sorry I didn’t realize that existed! Happy cake day btw 
You might be confused but It works as it was built for. This is a cross post of the original posting on the /r/datascience subreddit. This posting is meant as a control. The /r/datascience post, got almost 20 votes. Our model was built specifically for /r/datascience. I cross posted in /r/machinelearning got similar response as this one.

True story. The unsocialised programmer stereotype is alive and well in the /r/Python downvote clique.
You remember wrong. A package in the standard library may have "provisional" status (eg. `asyncio`), in which case backwards compatibility is not required. On top of that there are just bugs / regressions, which happen without Python core developers intending for. Sometimes they break backwards compatibility.
Or use [glob](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html?highlight=glob) instead of listdir.
The graph needs to be more elegant for that. This is more like /dataisugly.
If he/she is just starting programming, [MIT Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) might be more enjoyable learning experience. Don't worry about making them a great programmer. Let them write horrible code. Unless they write bad code, they won't be learn to recognise and correct it. Let them fail; let them fail early, and fail often. After that head over to Coursera/Edx and there are a number of courses about python in particular and programming in general. 
Try codingbat.com, it's a bunch of practice problems that help practice the basics of programming. If you get stuck Google is your friend. Also, there are a ton of online books to help- if your going to head this route I recommend "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python", which is completely online for free at automatetheboringstuff.com Finally, when you get some experience under your belt start chasing your ideas. Working on/building projects is a great way to learn in my opinion.

&gt; One is a timeline, the other is a time amount A timeline is also a time amount. What is up? Spending more time making useless charts? Yes according to the Y axis, higher means spending more time. So what is the X axis? Well its time, so the further along the X axis you go the more time you've spent making useless charts.... WHICH IS WHAT THE Y AXIS WAS DOING!

Amount of time spent **IS** time gone by!!! I feel like I'm taking crazy pills over here, 
I have visual studio, but theano don't try to use it. Do you know which party of theano must be edit ?
Yeah that graph would also make no sense. What would the mid point of that graph represent to you?
You have some very severe misapprehensions about how graphs work.
I feel like I’ve encountered a ken m in the wild 
What does geometry have to do with this
What exactly do you mean by "You remember wrong"? Take a look at the [removals](https://docs.python.org/3.7/whatsnew/3.6.html#removed) in 3.6, and tell me they aren't breaking changes. 
What does it have to do with what I wrote?
The only condition is that the slope of the line is within the range [0,1]. Cannot be &lt; 0, because it is impossible to un-spend time wasted. Cannot be &gt; 1 because it's impossible to spend more time than has occurred on something. Otherwise it's just another dependant variable. You seem to be caught up in units, when what matters is quantities.
It's just a video of Hateinger forgetting to mention attrs and being overly cocky in his presentation. The rest is just salty people being annoyed the jerk is still in the center of cpython's maintenance.
That has nothing to do with this, what matters here is that you have 2 dimensions representing 1 dimension of data. The middle (or any other part) of the Axis makes no sense.
It's a graph of time on one axis vs concurrent activities and the percentage of which could be considered a waste of energy on the other axis. The phrasing is just colloquial. HTH.
Good point, I still haven't built the habit of checking pathlib.
Sorry, now I realized that my reply went into a wrong thread. This was intended for KingofGamesYami. 
Charts. Are. Not. Geometric. Line. Segments.
I'd need to know the endpoints. So I've done is define the units of the axes.
OK, thanks for the clarification. 
"Euclidian charts" do not have any rule restricting the units.
Wait, XKCD is not Python 3 compatible? Doesn't he know to `from future import print`? /s
Never mind them; just another example of Dunning-Kruger effect at play.
You can plot how many apples you have against how many apples your neighbor has. The fact both axes use the same units is irrelevant, because they're still different things.
Yeah that would be an actual relevant graph. You can't plot how many apples you have against how many apples you don't have.
No it's not. That would make sense. It's a graph of time vs a graph of time spent on concurrent activities. Which means the graph points to the same value. 
Middle of X and Middle of Y. Don't mean to be a dick, despite no one even attempting to listen to what I'm actually saying, but I don't see how I needed to explain that.
Because the second thing is meaningless. None of the axes you've been objecting to have been meaningless. How much time you spend doing something is a question that has a right answer; how much time has passed also has a right answer. "How many apples you don't have" does not have an answer.
People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but *actually* from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint - it's more like a big ball of wibbly wobbly... time-y wimey... stuff.
Why not? 
My understanding is that they are approximately the same in terms of performance. In some cases one is a bit faster, but not consistently one way or the other.
How many apples you don't have is the inverse of how many apples you DO have. You don't need two axis for that, just one will do. If you show an axis for time, lower on that axis would be using less time. If you show another axis showing how much time you spent doing something, that axis is also redundant. You can just show the first axis going down. Since no axis represents the amount of quality of the final product you have two axis that both mean more or less time dependent on what direction you go. 
I get that it's wibbly wobbly, and certainly wimey, but can you call time timey?
Showing how many apples you have only needs a line, 0 at the bottom, 5 somewhere above 0. Anything beyond that would be redundant. Kinda like showing time on two axis.

Hahah, good to know! I feel bad clogging down this subreddit though, but I'm glad I got it to work with everyone's help here :) 
There’s no middle of an infinite series 
So what’s the problem?
Really trying to reverse engineer a proprietary network protocol into python. Currently, it's only in C and JNI for Java. Lack of documentation is really making this hard.
There is no "above" with one axis. When you say "above", you're talking about a change along the *y*-axis.

**Histogram** A histogram is an accurate representation of the distribution of numerical data. It is an estimate of the probability distribution of a continuous variable (quantitative variable) and was first introduced by Karl Pearson. It is a kind of bar graph. To construct a histogram, the first step is to "bin" the range of values—that is, divide the entire range of values into a series of intervals—and then count how many values fall into each interval. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

Yes, its the middle of whatever endpoint you choose to define. What that endpoint is doesn't matter here.
