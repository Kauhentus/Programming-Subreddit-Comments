Thanks for that. I am brand new to programming; is there anyway to put that into words that someone new can understand. This system does this and that system does that type of thing. It seems like there is a lot going on there.
&gt;In this case I think there's an argument about what purpose the software serves, and ~~GitHub~~ bus companies being a private platform can ban ~~whatever they want~~ Rosa Parks from sitting where she wants.
It is not their job to judge the moral value of a program. Are they here to host software, or to judge the morality of a software? This is not good. Are they gonna start banning people when they don't like the use that is made out of their software? Today DeepNude, tomorrow what else? This door shouldn't have been opened.

I'm helping build an in house file transfer application for my company. I helped build the SFTP client for picking up and sending files, the PGP client for encrypting and decrypting, and now working on the FTP client. I had never worked with Python before this project, so it's been challenging and fun. The hardest part as the project gets more complex is error handling and making sure the exceptions are helpful.
The choice is always the same: further the nanny state for the "good of the people", or trust that most people are basically good and not total idiots and let them show it, I realize there's a lot of evidence against it, but I still prefer to be optimistic about my fellow man.
Atom and PyCharm are 2 different products in the end....
&gt; See also: democracy. I assume you mean that the other mix of society, platform owners, and legislative bodies represents democracy. If so, who decides that this democracy gets to judge the other's democracy's health?
I'm very curious about this as well, I guess we will have to find out.
&gt; even though I'm sure someone could come up with practical applications for them [They've tried this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Plowshare). Despite the good intentions, it was widely regarded as a bad move. Conversely, AI/ML has already obvious and numerous practical uses - not even considering ones we haven't thought up yet.
**Project Plowshare** Project Plowshare was the overall United States program for the development of techniques to use nuclear explosives for peaceful construction purposes. As part of the program, 31 nuclear warheads were detonated in 27 separate tests. Plowshare was the US portion of what are called Peaceful Nuclear Explosions (PNE); a similar Soviet program was carried out under the name Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy. Successful demonstrations of non-combat uses for nuclear explosives include rock blasting, stimulation of tight gas, chemical element manufacture, unlocking some of the mysteries of the R-process of stellar nucleosynthesis and probing the composition of the Earth's deep crust, creating reflection seismology vibroseis data which has helped geologists and follow-on mining company prospecting.The project's uncharacteristically large and atmospherically vented Sedan nuclear test also led geologists to determine that Barringer crater was formed as a result of a meteor impact and not from a volcanic eruption, as had earlier been assumed. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
It's censorship it's just not a 1^st amendment violation.
&gt; GitHub is in some degree responsible, legally and morally, for the content it allows on its platform. Well they are now. Once you start "curating" you lose common-carrier protection and *become* responsible for all the content on your site.
Right before 3.7.3 came out I got 3.7.2 :(
[The subreddit sidebar has a list of links. They're pretty good.](https://i.imgur.com/7z89ZYj.jpg)
that b is simply not true in reality. sure, while its in the uncanny valley, it's possible. but eventually these things will be as seamless as anything else. if you want to argue educational value, then relegate it to an educational platform. after the uncanny valley, there's no amount of detection that will make a image detector know whether or not these bits are fake. you are essentially claiming P =NP without any proof. just knowing how something is made is not the same thing as declaring something is fake.
That the wheel needs to be copied.
That's just being censored. Self censorship is when you avoid certain topics to avoid backlash from some powers even though you didn't receive explicit instructions to do so.
How did you made it , looks impossible you got any tutorial i could use to make this type of things requiring to automate process like this?
Is there a package for encrypting passwords in python you recommend?
Way to make a strawman - the Montgomery buses were run by the city and part of public funded transportation. Laws that apply to government institutions (e.g. freedom of speech, restrictions on discrimination, etc.) would obviously apply to the bus systems, or any public transport system, in ways that are not legally applicable or enforceable against a private company.
Sorry nobody helps, they're in a rush too and can't be bothered to read that mess. After you're done work reformat it and post to /r/learnpython
No, they don't have the money.
Thank you explaining it amazingly . The code was the only one found to give a complexity of O(n) apart from using Hash map/dictionary.

And why would Microsoft want that protection? Why would they defend and enable bad actors who want to make life worse for their valuable users? Free speech is a law protecting individuals from prosecution for protected speech, not a moral imperative that companies should provide harbor to those who would damage their business.
You're roughly correct. [Technology already exists at the fringes of this "fake detection" problem](https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/06/adobe-shows-off-first-research-for-tools-to-detect-manipulated-photos/) (although I believe that's for altered images, not whole/partial fabrications). /u/cecilkorik is correct that the search space is so unimaginably huge that you could never expect to fully recreate input-&gt;output and thereby prove something is faked, but you CAN use more machine learning to train a discriminator to detect images. The trouble is that these models (GANs) are essentially trained via an arms race between a generator and the same type of discriminator I mentioned above. Better discriminators will eventually mean more believable fakes and so on. For now, I suggest anyone reading this takes a few minutes to familiarise themselves with common tell-tales of GAN-faked images. I don't know of any for this particular technology, but it's common to see things like inclusions or exclusions (random small details missing or added in unrealistic ways), texturing or warping of image backgrounds, oddly shaped blur, etc. etc. Don't look at the semantically "important" bits like facial features, look at the bits that are less likely to be uniform in a normal photo - hairstyles, hand positions, backgrounds, lighting, large patches of featureless skin, and so on.
sure you are, spam bro
Disinformation Tools. I like that name to the phenomenon/category of tools out there
Psst... `if '.' not in line:`
So when it *matters most*, they make a choice that directly conflicts with the entire fucking point of the open source movement. &amp;#x200B; Fucking psychopath Microsoft/Whomever. Are we all kids here? Grow the fuck up. You do this sort of shit and it will just go elsewhere or underground. Good job cowards.
You shouldn't.
Wait - is set doesn’t use any kind of hashing, then that code *cannot* be O(n). A naive worst-case scenario, with an implementation of set that is just an array of unique numbers, is O(n^2). Consider an example where arr has 100 elements. Naively, you’d think that since you are iterating once, you have (n) iterations. But each check of array requires algebra to see if each (i+k) is in array. In fact, the way it’s coded (with two distinct “in array” tests), it iterates over array twice! So the very last item in a 100-item arr requires checking i+k and i-k against every element in array, which is 99*2 = 198 tests *just* for element #100. That’s really bad. Now, set may be improved: maybe keep it sorted, and then search it in a binary manner. That speeds up the search part (it’s now 2 * log_2(n) searches per element) - but now you have more complexity in keeping array sorted while inserting items, which also requires log_2(n) comparisons. So you have O(3*log_2(n)), or more qualitatively, O(log_2(n)). Still not O(n). There may well be better algorithms than this that approach O(n) even without hashing... but this ain’t it.
Who the fuck is making these dumbshit decisions at github? This is the very fucking reason why you exist you fucking idiots. When big shit like this come, YOU FUCKING NURTURE IT BECAUSE IT WONT JUST GO AWAY BECAUSE YOU PUT YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND. Ironic as fuck. Did they forget what the point of github was?
Indeed. The real problem is that a private platform can become the de-facto mandatory standard. Like Youtube and GooglePlay.
Too bad the technocrats decide what you get to see. While shouting "fascist!"
Its not a get out of jail free card. There are clear ways to tell what is a deepfake and whats not. Its just \*difficult\* at a lazy glance to now. Also the other thing has been happening for many decades. It is just blackmail/harassment and will be punishable the same ways.
Then why did OP post to /r/python? Changing that upvote to a downvote now.
It is officially supported. It is the future of Android.
Have you called support? Some times they can give you a refund
They’d want the protection as a CYA against getting a successful suit against them because they missed something harmful. Having that protection gives them the defense of “it’s not our responsibility”
…but it is a “cast reasonable doubt” card, which is often identical.
Good. Let the fuckers who are making fake nudes of people get malware.
Oh come on, I *just* built 3.7.3 this morning.
Honestly I doubt that Github is the one who took the repo down. Forks are still up and it would be easy for Github to go through those. And the dev made a new "grab the nudes" app. This was probably a publicity stunt for said app.
Some of us don't have a personal machine and have to use the PC's at our local library
I have the feeling the dev took it down, not Github, as forks are still up and the dev made a new app. Seems this was a publicity stunt.
The option of the future is a python language server (look up the language server protocol), although finding a client and server which, in combination, do what you want in a nice way, could be tricky. The most generic historically-favoured option is jedi. Beyond that, you're on editor-specific options. PyCharm community edition is open source, iirc, and the autocomplete is *spectacular* - it infers types and stuff like that. VScode integrates with language servers and jedi.
What about cost? The article didn't address this point.
Use whatever the instructor uses.
We love how it generates [openapi/swagger](https://www.openapis.org/) specs from our code. We also love the way it enforces the in/out arguments with [pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) Switching from different approaches, [fastapi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) is the one we're sticking with. It fits well from single lightweight app to full-blown microservice (k8S/knative/istio).
10 or 15 years ago, this project would have been what I ever dreamed of. I would have learned python back then just to adjust it, instead of learning it the boring, CS-light way years later. But now, I am not that interested in it. Seems a bit too sketchy for older me.
Although he brought up one good point. Tech to identify amateur porn lads and ladies is much better now, and similar to this program, more and more technology starts to develop at a much increased speed, and society has not caught up to this.

Thanks for the tip though
Read that, cannot get the data downloaded to perform the predict function you have written.
Which one did you pick?
If it's easy to detect what's a deepfake, then what's all the fuss about? Also, they're inevitably going to get too good to detect eventually.
Where did you hear that? I've only heard the opposite. On the stackoverflow language use survey kotlin is up 40% from 2018 to 2019 ([4.5%](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/) to [6.4%](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/)), and my own anecdotal evedence agrees with that. It's also just a really nice language imo
FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE!!! Great! Here we are again in the dark ages where certain knowledge was forbidden because it was blasphemic. Who defines what is forbidden knowledge? How is this even possible? What about the development that might have come based on this approach? Someone who already cloned the project, rehost it somewhere where it wouldn't get banned, please! It's not solely about removing clothes. It's a political problem. We **must not** allow knowledge to be forbidden! Where will the line be drawn? And who will draw it?

Success of malware campaigns is to the detriment to everyone.
This is incorrect. You do not lose protection by curating. Do you have a source for this claim? Otherwise YouTube, Twitter, etc... would have lost their protection long ago. See here for more: https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230

I thought people didnt use filter() or map() nowadays. Now everyone seems to have lost their minds over list comprehension
Hey, thanks for your reply. The "two" tables I want to compare between the two databases are always the same structure. Table XYZ exists in the same structure (same keys, same columns) in system 1 and system 2 (respectively database 1 &amp; database 2), but the possibility is there that the content varies from time to time. This is due to two different ways to bring this content to the tables via different classes. To verify the usage of those different classes, since they are supposed to provide the same table content, I want to compare the tables and see if the content is the same.
I'm enjoying it so far honestly. The author (Eric Mathes) gives plenty of examples, and I feel like he starts in the book well. I've never done coding before and I believe I'm grasping the content quite well, most likely because how he sets up each chapter, he begins with variables, and strings, and talks about the kinds of things you can do with python. The chapters 12-14 I think even show you how to code a space Invaders type game, so I'm really motivated to get to know the basics and fundamentals and try my hand at developing 2-D rogue likes.
Personal use of course.
do u have a link to the course ur taking?
It's still Java, different language only.
not entirely true, Pandas read_csv() has the option *chunksize* that allows you to iterate over a large file df_chunk = pd.read_csv(r'../foo/bar.csv', chunksize=10000)
Good luck soldier
There is already software to generate (fake) pictures of humans, so you could just have that create pictures of children, feed it to DeepNude, then either approve or disapprove of the result. This solution is rather manual though, so your point still stands, at least for inpatient people. That said, once you've accrued enough approved material, perhaps you could use *that* as reference.
Pretty sure common carrier status only applies to certain telcos. Microsoft / github should never have had common carrier status.

I just got his book in the mail. Looking forward to getting in to it this week.
Which one did I pick? In what regard?
Sadly I think you have to purchase the book I'm using. It's called Python Crash Course. But I've heard good things about automate the boring stuff. I got the book I'm talking about for like 23 dollars on Amazon Kindle
Thank you! I know I'll need it!
More effort into Reddit than programming so far.
Netcraft confirms it.
Yup. You know you've really begun learning something when you want to holler wtf every now and then.
Good luck, man. I'd only want to recommend to stick to notepad and terminal more in the beginning, because, ides are powerful, sure, but i saw too many times how people can't import a module because ide does not autocomplete.
PyCharm also has a built in terminal window that lets you interact with the environment you are developing in. The notable upshot of this is that you are able can `pip install` your packages from there into the virtual environment that the IDE creates for you. PyCharm also helpfully reads the `requirements.txt` file and suggests installing the packages you specify from there, remember to always specify requirements with the package name and specific version `requests==2.22.0` for example. The process you describe is discouraged for a number of reasons; most important of which is that you intermix packages between all of your projects. In a workplace environment or even if you decide to start helping an open source project, you will not want to spoil your system python with packages unrelated to the project. The virtual environment makes sure that only the packages you decide should be in it are present and nothing else, this lessens the chances for bad interactions between packages you might not have thought were interacting but in fact do introduce exotic bugs.
Could this be the same book: http://bedford-computing.co.uk/learning/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/No.Starch.Python.Oct_.2015.ISBN_.1593276036.pdf
Which course
Agreed, very excited to begin tho. It takes time, and I accept that.
How can you be sure that [https://tempail.com/en/](https://tempail.com/en/) will not fuck you over?
Oh! The book is called Python Crash Course! By Eric Matthes. I'm only in the very very beginning of the book.
Depends on the input, it only works with frontal bikini pictures, doesn't work at all with regular clothes. Even if it works the resolution is still pretty low, but the results do look reasonably realistic until you go artifact hunting.
Slightly off topic: pygame is a really nice piece of software, good for education purposes. However, it suffers from some limitations if it comes to animation. If your project is not strictly for fun and education, you should consider using pyglet instead of pygame.
Name checks out
Just because there are some tribe that does it does not mean that we cannot conduct a thought experiment showing how it is bad. That is like the very basis of philosophy. We can definitely prove some things are bad logically. Will that stop people, your tribe from doing bad ? No, but saying that "bad" and "good" are entirely subjective is just wrong
"Having a tool that can generate nude and pornography from any person and even children is not bad" Some redditor probably. This is the kind of the genie is out of the bottle stuff we knew would happen in the past.
The one that prevent child porn from being generated in my humble opinion.
Bokeh can output static html files depending on what you want it to do. Bokeh is very efficient in that it’s a JS library designed to interact with other programs. Essentially, you can write python which will create graphs in JavaScript- then you can update those graphs by sending data and the JavaScript will take care of the updating of the image (puts the burden of redrawing a graph onto each users web browser, instead of a server). But if you just want this hosted locally, that’s not of too much concern. A little further abstraction away from bokeh, is holoviews. Holoviews is a neat project that attempts to combine analysis + visualization all into the same pipeline. It works hand in hand with bokeh, matplotlib, and plotly to create interactive plots and dashboards. Has some extremely neat functionality from their “DynamicMap” class to create exploratory plots. panel (google search “pyviz panel”) is a dashboarding project made the help you glue pieces from the aforementioned libraries into a coherent dashboard. Very helpful for managing widgets and their subsequent plumbing. Plotly, I’ve heard good things about getting small projects up and running with plotly but have never tried it myself. Plotly has out of the box statistical plots (think of the plots seaborn provides matplotlib with) which is really nice. Regardless of the above choice, they can all output static html files that you can go in and change. However, this can result in extremely large html files depending on how much data you want to cram in there.

If your ide is not recognizing import modules, it's likely because the env for your project does not have them. Be sure to use the same base env for all or like a pro make sure you are setting up your env correctly to start for your projects.
Why do you think it's tedious?
Voted and nice work! Also, don't forget, 100% coverage is always a *minimum* coverage so keep working on it.
this is some shitty code. thanks pajeet
Do yourself a favor and look into some non os bound python installs like conda if you want to learn on windows.
Yeah, in that case, yes, but you need to know how it operates in order to fix it, when you install modules with alt+enter, you probably won't know.
Uninstall League of Legends! ;) Jk, good luck buddy. It can be hard but also very rewarding.
Well this is not the problem of the ide, as a professional you want your projects isolated by env. Anyone looking to use an ide should learn first how to use said ide..
Yeah, that's exactly, what i said
Also wouldn't it be easier to stop it and detect it if the code was open and available to all

Ok! 😅
Just a tip from someone who was recently learning python. Spend some time learning all the basics e.g. for/while loops, syntax, arrays etc and then do a project to learn more advanced things. E.g. create a script that allows you to find the scores online and push it into a CSV file. Programming is just like any language, you need to learn the basics and then go out and actually practice and use the learning guides/books as a reference when you need them.

 I started with the same book as well. It's a fantastic resource and the author is very detailed and easy to follow. I wasn't too interested in the projects, so I decided to move on to automate the boring stuff. Remember, consistency is key. If you don't practice, you won't retain the info. Best of luck.
From the couple of .py files I looked at there were no comments really explaining what they did. I think that should be added.
That's just the way it works in python. You need the quotes to reference a string, otherwise it thinks you're referencing a variable of that name. Question for you: how would you try to input a string of "5"? (rather than an int)
Thank you! I plan on moving toward that book once I figure the basics out. I'd like to finish this book though, and I hope I can grind through it. I plan on coding every day, and following the book as well as trying to give myself exercises off the top of my head to just practice what I've learned. Like seeing how much I can combine or concatenate with no real direction or goal, just getting used to the functions and creating strings and variables. It's really weird so far, I've never done anything like it, but I really like it.
So it's cool if Facebook removes all black people because they're a private company?
Good point
I'd say you and /u/Bonca1222 are both right to degrees... Sure, there is a degree of sophistication that could theoretically be achieved where it would be functionally indistinguishable from reality even by the most sophisticated tools, but i'd say that's much further than just crossing the uncanny valley. Just because you can fool people doesn't mean you're not leaving detectable signatures. Ultimately isn't an arms race, and it's *probably* best if it's conducted in the open. Also as others said, probably the right answer in the long run isn't detection of the fakes, but pushing adoption of cryptographic verification. If that's the case then the deep fake detection tech doesn't have to win the arms race forever... just hold out long enough for people to start assuming that if something isn't cryptographically verified that it's probably not real.
Summary: if you use anything that uses OpenSSL, even indirectly, you should definitely upgrade. I didn't think OpenSSL upgrading from 1.1.0 to 1.1.1 was a big deal [but apparently it is](https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2018/09/11/release111/). Note also that it's an LTS version so if you make this upgrade you won't have to do it again for a long time. For anything else, it's probably not worth it.
Thank you much! One thing I was curious about though... Is there any specific reason some code I read has a space before and after an = sign? I've tried to run lines of code without a space and it still runs, but when I see other code like the code I see in this book, there is a space before and after an = sign. E.g when naming a variable This is how I see it in the book name = "person" print(name) person But if I type it like this name="person" print(name) person It still works I'm pretty sure. Any reason to actually put the spaces before and after the = sign?

Check out the panda library. It’s really nice for something like this. You may also need the xlrd library installed.
Apologies, but I'm just following the instructions in the book because I'm completely new to coding. Python Crash Course told me to download python and then gen. Not to sure what modules I would be importing. Could you maybe give me an example?
I've just finished chapter 3 and really enjoying learning through this book. Although I have some coding experience from back when I was in Uni, it's a great book to refresh your memory and teach you all the basics in Python. I initially bought the book but realised that e-book is easier for me to use so if anyone is interested, pay me postage and I can ship the book to you.
It’s just for readability purposes. It makes the code cleaner to look at.
Python (in general) ignores spaces on the same line. The spaces are just so the code is more readable to humans. So a=2-3+ 4 (space intended) and a = 2-3+4 mean the same thing. Edit: you can also do multiple spaces
Good look out man. I also got the book on Kindle, it's a lot easier to use my phone. I'm just getting passed the white stripping I think it was called? Like rstrip() lstrip) strip()

Awesome, haha happy to know I can come here to ask questions, it was really the purpose of this post to be honest and its delivered already.
I don't mean to be disrespectful, but why does a comment like this receive so much support? Do people genuinely think that removing the primary source of something will make it *more* widespread? I understand the Streisand effect etc., but really?
doesn't make any sense
Well, no specifics here, just an advise to do more things on your own in the beginning to see, what actually happens under the hood. Seems, like you're using python interactive shell, so it's fine. It's more of a problem with other languages, like cpp, one of my friends has been writing commercial code for 3 years and he never opened cmake, so now he's having a lot of with it, when no visual studio is available :)
Why are you learning Python? Hobby? Work? I picked it up for bit of both. I am a gamer and would be nice to be able to code and design. Also, I am trying to get into DevOps which Python would be very useful in
Read the sidebar... And then head over to r/learnpython, they'll help you out.

This reminds me those games of the '80s, the ones you found on the pages of these home computers' magazines and you had to type, line by line, the whole program on your Commodore 64. Btw, good job!
&gt;As soon as this tool is banned others will come. Not if Github makes it part of their terms of use. &gt;There will come tools that are not specific to nudes but you can use them in that way. [...] where do you draw the line? You mean like Photoshop? I'll give you a hint, this tool that is specifically designed to manufacture fake nudes is on one side of the line, and Photoshop is on the other side. &gt;If I want to make fake nudes privately I think I should be able to do so. I mean this is somewhat a moral issue, but okay. Github isn't preventing you from producing fake nudes, they are just refusing to host software that does that.
Well if you output a list you can do that using a dictionary and list comprehension. You just need to make a dictionary of the form `{‘H’:’Hydrogen’, ...}` and then do `[dictionary[key] for key in element_list]`
The problem is that starting out most people do not create their own isolated python virtual environments. Because of this people start installing modules or even updating python on the native python. This native python is used by a lot of applications. There have been multiple accounts of doing this screwing up native Microsoft applications.
Hobby and job related, at least what I see myself doing in a future career. I don't know the path I should take to get exactly where I want to go. For fun and to learn how to code I'd love to dev up some 2-D rogue-like games. My ultimate goal is to somehow get involved in the field of deep learning, or AI development. I have ambitious goals to create education oriented AI some day
No worries haha
Ahhh I see. Well thank you for the advice for sure.
print(" I wish i had the détermination to learn python ")
Sounds great :) Maybe a route towards AWS or any cloud platform might help with that?
Interesting 🤔 I'm only following this books instructions to get a grasp on how coding works at all. It recommended geany, and I don't really know any better. So what exactly is Conda?
Looks like you are looking for pandas.read_excel(). This will convert the excel spreadsheet into a pandas data frame. To convert a specific column of the pandas data frame into a list run df[‘column name’].values.
Yes! This the sauce for anyone who's interested.
when you have the basics complete i would recommend robotics, its easy to learn with a rasberry pi, helps perfect logic and is very rewarding
Me too - I grew up in that era and had a Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore 64. Good times. &amp;#x200B; Thanks!
Anything specific about the language? Or just coding in general?
Seriously. The tomatoes and pickles aren’t even labeled and FORTRAN, the only language that *really* matters, isn’t even on there.
You can use xlrd library - [https://xlrd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://xlrd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) This library is simple and lightweight.
Performance can be an issue in some cases. The GIL is still there, and subinterpreters seem to be stuck in PEP limbo. The async ecosystem is maturing, but slowly - there's no good async ORM, for one. Embedding Python is still a big pain. Python 2 still exists.
How dare you leave Vue out!
&gt;Because of this people start installing modules or even updating python on the native python What native python? Mine came from Python.org and before that I didn't have a python environment
I recommend the course by freecodecamp on youtube, after finishing it I was able to make bots and programs on my own with little to no help from the internet!
Check this out- I'm pretty sure you can download google sheets as excel files too. https://youtu.be/vISRn5qFrkM
Try vscode or syder3. Conda is a package manager for python modules, like pip. But conda have those modules compiled, binary.
LORD ANACONDA is proud of you.
string = 'this is a string' object = string print(string + ' ' + object) &gt;this is a string this is a string
This was a really helpful book for me to read. Do every single exercise.
list = ["one", "two", "three"] print(list) list.append("four") print(list) &gt;["one", "two", "three"] &gt;["one", "two", "three", "four"] I hope this makes sense
I don't think I explained myself very well. I'm talking about the **user input window**. The user shouldn't be expected to use quotes while entering something in the program. As I said in the post, this is not happening in the IDLE, so I am guessing this is a quirk with how Terminal looks at user inputs.
Can anyone help me here . I know all the basic syntax of python but need to improve on writing codes . Anyone?
I see a bit of League in the background. Get your CS higher ;)
If you plan on doing stuff with AI/ deep learning in the some things that might be helpful are the [MIT lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63gFHB6xb-kVBiQHYe_4hSi) on AI to understand the underlying concepts and the python module [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials) for implementing neural networks
Youtube does the same shit. So does Twitter. They ban people all the time. You can build a server to host your own website with your own content if you wish.
Good question. I am just using the free account to try it out. The free level allows 30,000 transactions per month before you have to start paying.
Not sure about others but I’m making sure to save and advertise this tool as much as possible.
Import errors in pyinstaller exe's are almost always 1 of 2 things... either there is a hidden import within pyvlc that is preventing pyinstaller from grabbing all the necessary library code (all the py/pyd files of all the dependencies) or there can be import errors related to dll files, which can be harder to resolve. Often for dll files to work right you have to tell pyinstaller where those files are and include them as a data file so that they end up in your deployed application and can be found at runtime. If you do your exe as a folder and not a single exe, you can attempt to copy the vlc library into the deployed application folder and get the application working by hand... that can provide clues about how to automate the process and enable pyinstaller to capture the necessary files (by identifying which files get it to work). The pyvlc library files would be in your site-packages folder. Sorry if this is unhelpful, just providing some tips. vlc is a big, popular open source library, so you should get support on the pyinstaller issue tracker for issues related to it's python bindings. Pyinstaller has special import hooks for popular libraries and only by people submitting issues are they able to keep those hooks up to date and working.
someone else pointed it out, but yeah, to be clear, it's the module/package hierarchy, not directories. given this heirarchy ``` . | bar.py | foo.py | main.py | +---pkg | | bar.py | | foo.py | | __init__.py | | | +---mod | | | bar.py | | | foo.py | | | __init__.py | | | | | +---submod | | | | bar.py | | | | foo.py | | | | __init__.py ``` every bar.py contains: ``` print(f'bar.py with name: {__name__}') try: from .foo import msg print(msg) except Exception as e: print(f'Couldn\'t get .foo ({type(e).__name__}: {e!s})') try: from . import foo print(foo.msg) except Exception as e: print(f'Couldn\'t get .foo.msg ({type(e).__name__}: {e!s})') try: from ..foo import msg print(msg) except Exception as e: print(f'Couldn\'t get .foo ({type(e).__name__}: {e!s})') ``` every foo.py contains: ``` msg = f'My name is {__name__}' ``` and main.py contains: ``` print(f'main.py with name: {__name__}') import bar import pkg.bar import pkg.mod.bar import pkg.mod.submod.bar ``` we get output like this: ``` D:\projects\scratch\fldr&gt;python main.py main.py with name: __main__ bar.py with name: bar Couldn't get .foo (ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package) Couldn't get .foo.msg (ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package) Couldn't get .foo (ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package) bar.py with name: pkg.bar My name is pkg.foo My name is pkg.foo Couldn't get .foo (ValueError: attempted relative import beyond top-level package) bar.py with name: pkg.mod.bar My name is pkg.mod.foo My name is pkg.mod.foo My name is pkg.foo bar.py with name: pkg.mod.submod.bar My name is pkg.mod.submod.foo My name is pkg.mod.submod.foo My name is pkg.mod.foo ``` if we create a main.py deeper in the heirarchy with this: ``` print(f'main.py with name: {__name__}') import bar ``` and try to run it, it'll fail like this: ``` D:\projects\scratch\fldr\pkg&gt;python main.py main.py with name: __main__ bar.py with name: bar Couldn't get .foo (ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package) Couldn't get .foo.msg (ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package) Couldn't get .foo (ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package) ``` The reason for that is explained [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16981921/relative-imports-in-python-3), and it boils down to "relative imports can only work in a package, and you have to begin execution from outside the package (like in my first example), instead of trying to execute the package files directly. There are workarounds to this (including running with e.g. `python -m pkg.mod.main` though I that doesn't work here for some reason I didn't bother to dig into)
I found the solution! &amp;#x200B; It had to with raw\_input() vs input() and Python 2.7 vs Python 3. The solution was to use raw\_input(), or use Python 3, which considers input() to be raw\_input().

Thank you for your suggestion, I'll check it out.
Didn't thought about Sqlite. Shouldn't hard to modify if anyone prefer built-in solution :)
Ignore this redditor; Follow the book. You can you use vscode which is more friendly tbh but If your completely new to coding in general just stick with geany as for conda what the redditor was on about when you install python it will install globally meaning on all the computer which means if you install let says bs4 1.5 on you pc and then you want bs4 2 as well you cant it wont work a way around this is setting up a virtual environment where it sets up python within that environment and any-package installed will go to that virutal environment that way you can have multiple environments on the same pc you don't need it now the book will show you later with the projects but if your'e going into django the recommended way of installing it is through a ve and their are different ve's like virutal env, conda or pipenv (I recommend and office python does too) the book will show you virtual env when you get to django project go with with it then if you want to go into django get the book django for beginners and it will teach django and how to install it with pipenv(very easy) As for learning python have a strict routine so when you do lose motivation your routine will push to code and envetually you will regain the passion again it's what happens to a lot of people good luck
It's subtle, because on first glance I was like, okay, sure. But then, wait... what?
Why's MongoDB not among databases?
Always a comedian....
Congrats, man. Keep in mind: when you get stuck on something and it seems like you're not doing any progress at all, this mean you've found a rare and precious opportunity to learn and grow. Although it sounds really cheesy, this is something that took me quite a time to learn. The inability to tolerate frustration is what makes us quit learning endeavors like programming, so be tough.

Python is fun. I build useful things with it because it's fun. People pay me to write useful things, and I have fun doing it.
And why is docker amongst languages?
I recently had to do this, I used openpyxl. It worked a treat and was easy to use.
So how is this terms of use going to be specified ? Its impossible to do it without banning all kinds of legit software.
Databases *on top* of programming languages? I bet you eat dessert before dinner, too.
No offense, but why are you digging into numpy if you haven't got the basics of python yet?
What's new in this??
It depends on the manner in which your applications install and use python. I personally find it easier to have my own install as I know it wont be use by anything other than what I use it for.
Okay so there's a bunch of databases that are cheese but also NoSQL somehow while MongoDB is meat? No, it's not brilliant, it's for tech illiterates to have talking points.
Fortran? Unless you write code in brainfuck, don't even talk to me
The easiest way is to export the data as csv from excel and use the builtin csv module.
Ignore me or not, it does not hurt to have your own python and package manger. I find your reply off putting just in the rhetoric so whatever floats your boat.
Why would you ask for down votes?
Theres is nothing "wrong" with it. The only thing that leads me to use my own is the fact that I cant guarantee other developers are not going to use it. I like to keep my dependencies to a minimum.
You've made a jump there. Terms of use is an agreement that can be *enforced*, which leads to the punishment. The terms in and of itself do not guarantee punishment, it is up to the company (Github) to select when they enforce rules. It may be impossible to specify the terms precisely enough to delineate between permissible and impermissible software, but in terms of actual punishment, the terms are just a guideline as to what you can expect to be allowed to host on their platform. If they say "we will not host software that encourages or is heavily used in the production of fake nudes", it's entirely unclear where the lines are, and they can enforce on a case-by-case basis.
And you think the combined effect of you and your peers in personally redistributing, or linking to archived distributions of, the software outweighs the fact it's no longer hosted on the most well-known open source software site? I feel like you could *maybe* make that argument, and I can't really disprove it. But I think it's *overwhelmingly likely* that the software gets less use long-term than it would have if it wasn't removed from Github.
I understand like 95% of the stuff, but sometimes I have problems with indexes . Like I understand it takes something makes it to an array and uses it in the np.argpartition() function with the -k last element. Everything over that is bigger, but I don't get the [-k:]
Get PyCharm Community edition. It's free. You will feel A LOT better.
Geany is a text editor, where as conda is a package manager with python that is decoupled from the os. Meaning you can download a tar and extract it anywhere you like. This allows you freedom in setting up your own python install and managing it separately. Conda may be getting ahead of you at this point, though.
Interesting. I would stay away from using python 2 as much as possible. Support for it will shortly be dropped so it will become redundant.
On Windows even!
Packaging and delivering python applications is still a problem. To take a python application built out of a mix of python and compiled code and turn it into a desktop runtime or a self-contained server \*\*still doesn't have a clear and well supported solution\* to bundle up the app, dependencies and interpreter. Too many tricks are still needed, mobile is still hard, documentation is often out of date. Hopefully now that packaging has improved a lot (huge props to the pip/pypi teams), bundling said packages will become simpler. &amp;#x200B; \*For the server side i will preempt someone shouting Docker by saying you shouldn't need to add a whole jenga tower-like stack just to run a simple service. And just because source-installs are a done thing doesn't mean they aren't kinda gross...
Trying to figure out how to get Python + Flask + IIS to work together. &amp;#x200B; I have a small flask app that accepts HTTP Posts from an internal application and needs to relay them to another system via HTTP Post while writing the message to disk. If someone has a better idea how to deal with that situation please let me know :)
You really do learn pretty fast when you do a little bit each day
…is no one going to talk about how i-O-fucking-S appears to be labeled as being server infrastructure? No, but really, this is hilarious, bravo. I _think_ it's satire, but [it's honestly hard to tell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law) with the amount of moronic business people running around.
I'm a computer science student going into my sophomore year this September. When I was looking for a summer internship, I used Python to automate searching and filtering positions that is suitable and relevant to me. I took it one step further by using Python to automatically customized my resume and cover letter for those jobs and automatically send them of to potential employers. Until today, I'm still getting emails/ phone calls from companies asking me to go for interviews that I "never" applied for. I was lucky enough to be able offered several paid intership opportunities. My current intership is one of them. That's how Python "changed" my life. I'm using the same code to apply for more scholarships for this coming school year!
Can I get uuuuuhhhhhhh...... full stack please?
Gah my eyes! Turn that dark on!
Well, it supports `RUN` command, duh. /s
Makes no sense but looks tasty
Sure, I'll update project very soon. Thanks for replay.
Thank you! I really look forward to learning this stuff, and you're completely right! I know our future holds computers everywhere, might as well learn how to manipulate/work some of them.
Are you importing them as `from bottle import *`?
Absolutely, no open source software existed and it was distributed en masse before Github.
Python has a relatively low barrier to entry for a lot of basic everyday uses. I, as a professional in a non-tech field, recently used python to automate some really boring repetitive task recently added to my teams workload. My supervisors are happy and impressed with labor saving and my peers are glad I have saved them from a significantly burdensome and tedious task. Best of all, I actually had fun automating something which I otherwise have no interest in doing :D
At first, I thought this is r/CrappyDesign lmao. Brilliant?
GraphQL didn't make the lettuce

What about double whopper?!?!
oh wow, didnt know geany was on windows
Now I am hungry.
The ketchup and the gerkin need labels too.
As others have said, readability. But spaces are often omitted when passing values to a keyword arguments. Say you have a function that prints a table. You'll often see `printtable(rows=5, cols=7)` instead of `printtable(rows = 5, cols = 7)`. Doesn't make a difference though.
I'll take my downvotes for phrasing this like a bit of an asshole, but work on practicing rather than patting yourself on the back for opening an IDE. Starting is good but it's not an accomplishment that deserves to be discussed among a bunch of people.
You just started python?
Wow this sure is some interesting news about the dynamic, interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, extensible programming language Python.
Brilliant? This is just a picture of a hamburger with buzzwords
Hold up, are the pickled under the patty? WTF kinda shit is this?
Replace jquery with a dash of vue.js and it might be palitable
Hey man opinions are like assholes, everybody has one. This was my very first program, on a very long journey. I shared it here to get advice and to spark conversation, and it seems to have done me well. It's all a part of my learning process. No one around me codes, but plenty of people on the internet have been doing it for quite some time. Even the books I've been reading say it's easier (obviously) if you have people who already know how to code. Not sure what else I'm supposed to take away from your comment but it wasn't very helpful. I'm already aware I need to spend as much time as I can just practicing what I learn, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't get on reddit and talk with a bunch of strangers about it.
Yes. I've never done coding before and this seemed like a good language to start with.
Been learning Python for a little over a month now, with some prior experience coding with Swift. I am currently going through the MIT Intro to Computer Science with Python course on edx. This project just kinda evolved from me tinkering around with Turtle. It’s definitely not the greatest finished product but it was fun to work on and I learned a lot about using Turtle and using git. All in all, it was probably around 6-7 hours of work. Check out the [Github](https://github.com/alexalbertt/turtlepix) repo if you want, I have uploaded two example images there as well! Thanks
same!...(use dark theme)
And hey, Press F12, Open console. Reddit is a cheeky bastard.
Python 2 still exists, but it’s life is short. People like supported dependencies. We have sort of switched over. I might be switching jobs soon. The new place uses IronPython, which is sort of maintained and is still on Python 2.7. It has .NET support (so ni Linux support either), no GIL, used to have numpy, but it doesn’t work anymore. Nobody noticed for two versions...I complained about Python 2. Python 2 sounds nice now.
What the f is wrong with you noob. Seriously you post that in *light mode*?
MongoDB only pawn in game of life
You aren't proficient in Google?

There must be a problem with this version, I'm using \`pipenv\` and getting an \`\[WinError 8\] Not enough memory resources are available to process this command\`. I cannot create virtualenv. Everything works great in 3.7.3
Nah, there's a bunch of OSes but for some reason there's simply "Google" in there.
Stuff inside an if clause is sometimes not run. That is why extProc = sp.Popen(['python','haha.py']) is sometimes not run and extProc is sometimes undefined.
I've actually solved the issue,it is related to global variable thingy. Thanks for the reoly
No problem. I think when it's obvious what everything does these could be very useful!
failure is just the beginning. First in order to succeed in life consider these tips * Always use dark mode. * Practice coding
Checkout automating boring stuff with python book. Its pretty fun.
That's what I thought as well. I want my database as far away from the user as possible.

**Hello world** in everything but master of none.
It's an Impossible Burger, so some of the vegetables (like MongoDB) are actually in the programming language.
Lmao !!! *in Thanos' voice* you have my respect
I started a new job with piles of scattered data in various files and in systems with and without data APIs. So I've been writing some ETL scripts for the most useful data, and hoping it doesn't just end up a pile of scattered code in addition to piles of scattered data!
In my opinion relative imports are pretty useful and I find myself using them pretty often.
Thanks a lot for the answers. You all are very kind and helpful. I amnot native speaker , so perhaps I havent expressed my question very exactly. During writing and testing the mentioned codes, I find out the 'for' loop works very differently as I thought. so I focus on the 'for' loop in this concrete case: how does it work and whats the reason behind it. Especially in the third step: i=2, so a[i]=8, a[i-1]=20, then they are swapped, after that 'i-=1', so now we get i=1, but why a[1]=8 and a[0]=10 willnot be compared any more, what happened in the fourth step, the for loop gones on or not? I am very confused. the essential questionis: what happens after 'i-=1'? what has the 'for'-loop done after this step?
Working slowly through a python game development course at Udemy. Seems to be the best way to truly learn a language is to program a game in it!

Sure they can but the comunity would probably be furious everytime it happens.
[The IBM AS/400 has a 33% market share in server hardware.](https://enlyft.com/tech/products/ibm-as-400) Maybe they don't matter to *you*, but they are still a big player.
Political correctness, that is your answer. Because (for now) it is aimed just for women, eveybody is going nuts. But if in any case it was fully released working for both men and women everybody would be like, meh! These people is saying like *"wow that must be the worst thing they could have possibly done, now everyone will hunt this down and keep sharing it, fucking geniuses."* ( /u/neglera doesn't know that these people are indeed late to the party, and in the end they made more a favour than a harm bringing this to the masses so we all can worry and take action instead of just complaining, he/she doesn't seem to know that there must be people already selling this kind of tools in the deep web but just not for women pictures.), they have narrow minds and as far as they know this is the first time this happen and this is obviously a lie, they cry for images but they don't realize there are fake videos being released everyday. And no body gives a fuck. The worrying thing isn't the tool because there are a lot of people developing these everyday with private purposes, in the end is just a adult human body, anatomy, you can watch it everyday in pornhub. boohoo The problematic thing and what seems inevitable and sad is this kind of tools would be used with kids in some point.
Shit... i'm learning Java rn, guess i will have to change then '-'
Because if you lean in Java it is going to hurt.
This does not have any sense dude, for example AWS and google servers run over linux, in that case we need another layer with Azure and Linux.
No, REAL programmers use butterflies.
SOAP is that brownish rotten salad you must remove before eating the burger.
Nobody's censoring the GAN papers. It's still in the open. But it's also nice not to make it trivially easy for people to cause harm.
There's an emacs command for that
I disagree. Keeping the rules broad makes it easier to justify removing content that is *obviously* not okay, like this repo. This is why most terms of hosting will have statements about "offensive content". Nobody is trying to objectively define what "offensive content" means, but it's a clause that can be used to remove content that is plainly harmful/offensive, but not otherwise against the rules. I've been trying to avoid steering this towards a more political angle, but I think it would be very hard to justify why anyone should host this application. The ability to take photos of non-consenting women and with relative ease turn them into (somewhat crude) nudes is just plainly not something the tech community should support. I don't care about whether you distribute them or not, it's disrespectful and offensive. Before you bring up "but i can just do it in photoshop", I'll repeat what another commenter said: Photoshop is a hammer, you can kill someone with it but 99% of its uses are not harmful, this application is a nerve agent, you can do experiments with it but 99% of its uses *are* harmful. If the community is going to be furious about a private company refusing to host software that is designed to humiliate women, I think we have bigger problems to talk about than the rules of Github.
I want my users as far away from my database, too.
Nice but who is that dashing fellow from the video?
It's the Salad and OGs don't disrespect SALAd
That would be the Holy Grail of teaching programming indeed.
This looks like something an ignorant dev whipped together to try to show their manager “how many technologies a full stack developer has to manage”.
People like to act as gatekeepers in datascience and technical fields generally. Its really weird. There is a certain ego boost to "tell it like it is" to beginners from the mountain top. Its 100% ego
Here let me take this clip art of some object and just add programming words to things
What do you mean? I don't remember hurting while I was learning Java.
I cant seem to get the code to format properly even tho i led with four spaces
Well, not too sure what to work on but I coded an interactive chess board for my verry last exam in school. Now I'm just standing around thinking about what I should do the following weeks and months.
Hopefully you picked up the second edition of the book. It's been updated to only use python 3 and the projects are updated with more current frameworks. 2nd edition came out a month or two ago.
Try leaving another empty line before your code.
It's just a part of the salad. The REST is fine.
I think it is spelled WOPR.
Thanks man hope people can see now!!!!
&gt;But if in any case it was fully released working for both men and women everybody would be like, meh! I don't think I see that as the case. I'm trying not to talk about sexism here, but I think it's easy to imagine examples where the reaction to a fake male nude (i.e. Keanu Reeves) is totally different to the reaction to a fake female nude (i.e. take your pick of literally any actress). Due to our almost honor-like culture around women's sexuality, it's obvious to me that this kind of tool is far more damaging to women than to men (of course given that it would work on men). The fact that it is exclusively aimed at women *is* a problem, but the tool in and of itself is still problematic and. &gt;The worrying thing isn't the tool because there are a lot of people developing these everyday with private purposes, in the end is just a adult human body, anatomy, you can watch it everyday in pornhub. I don't think the tool being widespread amongst private circles is something that makes me worry *less*. I totally see what you're saying but think you've missed something important. Sure, you can go on your favourite porn site and see as many naked women as you want, but these women *consented* to you seeing them naked. Making it more clear, do you think there's a difference between uploading a video of yourself in the nude to a popular site versus uploading a video of someone you don't know who you recorded with a hidden camera in a changing room? &gt;The problematic thing and what seems inevitable and sad is this kind of tools would be used with kids in some point. Obviously that's a problem of itself, and this goes beyond the reaches of Github, although Github refusing to host such tools helps (albeit in a minor way, since I assume people trying to manufacture child porn are not the kind of people to download their tools from Github).
I personally write all my applications in Google
I agree, Keanu is a good guy, but he's not a god. Stop worshipping him.

Looks like you're bottlenecked by your request rate; a thousand urls being checked one at a time is going to be very slow. A quick google search on asynchronous request processing for python suggests that the `aiohttp` library might be what you want (assuming you're on Python 3.5.3+).
I don't know if you're being sarcastic or something. The last Keanu film I watched was The Matrix a couple years ago, he was literally just the first well-known action actor that came to mind. I guess I'm surprised I didn't think of Tom Cruise.
Yeah, this kind of task is like the Hello World of async programming.
It's good news that more and more people are learning it.
I'm getting the same thing on two (Windows) computers. Maybe I'll spin up a VM to check.
The reason it's slower is because you're doing it sequentially. You'll want to parallelize it using some kind of task queue or threading. https://hackernoon.com/how-to-run-asynchronous-web-requests-in-parallel-with-python-3-5-without-aiohttp-264dc0f8546?gi=9e46b9d4b62a

What a braindead reply.
&gt; but that doesn't mean I shouldn't get on reddit and talk with a bunch of strangers about it. And you should. But the problem is, you're not really talking about anything. If you have questions about something specific or run into problems then by all means ask away.
Yeah that 33 is legacy percentage my friend. I get they're big and all that, but putting them next to linux and AWS as a part of the "full stack" is silly. Although they did just buy Red Hat so I guess they aren't going anywhere too fast.

Thanks ill check it out!
Python's ex 'Benevolent Dictator for Life' Google him.
Thanks a lot for the answers. You all are very kind and helpful. I amnot native speaker , so perhaps I havent expressed my question very exactly. During writing and testing the mentioned codes, I find out the 'for' loop works very differently as I thought. so I focus on the 'for' loop in this concrete case: how does it work and whats the reason behind it. Especially in the third step: i=2, so a[i]=8, a[i-1]=20, then they are swapped, after that 'i-=1', so now we get i=1, but why a[1]=8 and a[0]=10 willnot be compared any more, what happened in the fourth step, the for loop goes on or not? I am very confused. the essential questions: what happens after 'i-=1'? what has the 'for'-loop done after this step?
Next switch to linux and forget about windows.
Threading is trash.
This is really not appropriate for this subreddit.
The GIL is a major issue - no proper threading. Added to that, sub processes cannot kick off their own sub processes. Very limiting. It’s very, very slow. The lack of (mandatory) type safety is a big issue for medium to large code bases.
Symbolism aside, who the fuck eats pickles under the meat
It also misses another vital infrastructure part. Something known as a network? And maybe some protocols to communicate between nodes in suchs a network?

OP, you don’t know shit about full stack, do you? “Brilliant” 🤦🏻‍♂️
You can think of range(5) as a list \[0, 1, 2, 3, 4\]. The for loop is going through each element in order and thus decrementing "i" inside the loop, will not decrement "i" on the next iteration. For example: `for i in range(10):` `print(i)` `i -= 1` Produces: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
The technology behind it is. I meant the AI. The same software this program uses is being used by self driving cars.

If you’re wanting to maintain the existing formulas, then you might have to use VBA. As far as I’m aware, most python packages that work with excel just bring over the values.
Your comment is humorous. I was beginning to doubt myself when I first saw this. Like what am I missing here, how do I not see the connection? Glad I’m not the only one.

Not quite as sudden if you take a closer look at the photo - the juice boxes are a German brand, and under the table you can see part of a banner for some event, also in German ("Samstag" is German for "Saturday"). Our brilliant mechanical mixologist creator would seem to German, or at least *located in* Germany. Makes me swell with German pride :-P ... I suppose you would probably need to be pretty familiar with German/Germany to begin with, though, to be able to pick up on those hints in the photo, which makes it a bit of a Catch-22.
More specific than that.
Ops! You're totally right. Thank you for the link. Yeah, that's too much.
Well I really don't know I just know that I like to code ... I'm just very new to all this stuff

What kind of a normie shit is this? Where is SQLite3? This is a python sub after all.
Yes. Check 2Captcha API. We did it (in the office) a few weeks ago. Selenium + javascript (execute driver) + while True is all you need.
You can do efficient Shit with it (e.g. evenness test of a number n with 1&amp;n), you of course need it when doing binary manipulation (e.g. bytecode compiler/interpreter)
Shouldn't the cheese be under or mixed into meet, the lettuce as well? unless interfaces exist in some mystical nether region where code doesn't live and you are exposing your database server directly to the internet instead of using an interface?
I wouldn't say it's fundamental. It's definitely useful in places, but you won't be writing custom descriptors often, and existing ones generally tend to Just Work^tm as a convenient abstraction.
They just don't understand it!
Well they can just rename it and make its use broader and that would make it ok. So i guess you are ok with isp's censoring porn because its imoral and probably illegal to serve porn to minors? It's the same level. Tech companies get to be the ones censoring the internet based on morals or ethics. How much power over us should the tech companies have? A deepfake tool may be unethical but its certainly legal.
"You are the worst &lt;insert champion name&gt; I have ever seen. Please uninstall!!" Those are my find memories of league. The python community if much friendlier and nicer. A much better team comp to work with.
Ahem, ***I*** execute all my assembly commands by hand.
You probably never touch R, I can see that in your brave words. I'm a main C++ scientific programmer in the field of mass spectrometry. R has a lot of unique potentials for what was designed; statistics, data analysis and visualization. I do love python, but for those proposes, I prefer an scripting language like R. Hope you give it a try. If it's too demanding for you don't brother.
That's not what I said, and you know it. That's an ethical discussion that is completely separate from what I'm talking about. IIRC private companies do have to adhere to certain discrimination laws when hiring but they are not similarly restricted in who they cater to, such as with a platform. Hence why private scholarships can target specific minority groups without issue, or there are women only homeless shelters.
I use them almost daily. I have to deal with binary network protocols, sharing data with C code and firmware running on microcontrollers without operating system. The `struct` module is also a great friend of bitwise operators.

&gt; You probably never touch R i have a few times. i find it awkward to work with, even if it produces nice output. &gt; If it's too demanding for you don't brother. fuck off with your condescending bullshit.
It's not brilliant. It's incorrect.
I think the idea is that fullstack has become "you do everything" yet is treated like something as mundane as making a burger.

A mini-fridge works pretty well, and if you feed all the tubing internally to a single output spout (with a parallel one for the liquor), it really helps with the issue of little juice drops sticking in the tubing and spoiling; having the tubes on a toggle-feed between the individual mixers and a water line so you can periodically flush them out also helps. I built something similar, although not quite as technically sophisticated, around 5 years back, mostly as entertainment for parties. Eventually donated it to a friend when I stopped really throwing parties - it never quite worked perfectly (it didn't have any calibration functionality, so recipes were always somewhat "approximate"), but it was a lot of fun to build, and certainly got a lot great reactions.
The descriptor protocol is very fundamental to how python works. You probably won't use it as much as you would iterators, generators, and decorators, but I don't think that makes descriptors any less fundamental. &amp;#x200B; Anyway, it's not a very complicated subject. You'll spend more time making this post, reading the comments, and thinking about whether you should learn it than you would just learning it.
Yeah and I'll extend it.
You...just dont' use the stuff you don't want to use. [Here's a whole django application in 22 lines.](https://github.com/syntarsus/minimal-django/blob/master/minimal.py) That's not serving a REST API, but you get the idea.
Lol, srry if it was offensive. As said, R is a cool language in the context of sciences (In biology and chemistry is THE language for statistical analysis of very different datasets)
It just takes a few minutes...
I used Pandas too, I was able to specify columns and also sheets from my Excel document
Neat project you could play with rounding the RGB values and make your own filters
Then just download the csv file yourself either online or using pandas data reader
&gt;been told it is terrible to use virtual environments because of "dependency hell". With RHEL, if I remember right we had to build a specific Python version ourselves. This meant collecting a bunch of OS packages to support the building process. So from that perspective, yeah it can be a pain to manage. Python specifically, no. `pip` and requirements.txt makes it a breeze to manage. &gt;I've heard that one shouldn't use Python built from gcc because there would be conflict with the OS version That's not really right provided you build Python correctly. You can do a `make altinstall` which will preserve the existing symlinks to the OS's Python. Then, create virtual environments using your *alt-installed* python. That way, the OS version does not get overwritten and you can use whatever version you want.
so what you're saying is without grilled mushrooms its all worthless
It seems like a pretty dated diagram since they mention phone gap which nobody uses.

Hey I am having alot of trouble utilizing aiohttp, could you help?
What problems are you having?
The colorful letters make programming a joy.
&gt; this could end up being used to manufacture child porn with relative ease. from how I understood it you would need large amounts of child porn to start with as training data - unless you were OK with fully-matured adult features warped by a computer onto a kid, in which case... what the fuck, man.
too much .NET for the hamburguer

Why not do this with rsync? You don't even need python for that, or just call rsync from within a python script so you can do more than just rsyncing

Good job!
Fft, find frequency of Background audio, kill it (maybe?) Or try some filters (Low pass etc)
Maybe if you're running Python on the same computer Outlook is running on. Definitely not remotely.
That's so cool man. Best of luck!!
Performance wise? Not really other than it makes doing multiple things at once easier. Where aiohttp really shines over flask of websockets because it's a first class citizen rather than a janky bolt-on.
Belatedly upgrading our application to Python 3. Linux is all done and was almost a joy to work with. Trying to get the conda build to work on Windows though... OMFG it's slow progress. 😱😭
So true
 &gt;So i guess you are ok with isp's censoring porn because its imoral and probably illegal to serve porn to minors? Since when is anyone talking about the law? I think the tool itself has abhorrent intentions and implications, and I have yet to see anyone effectively argue otherwise. I don't care about the legality, I'm asking "Should a private company feel compelled to host content they disagree with?", and I don't think anyone is going to argue that the answer is no. &gt;How much power over us should the tech companies have? Try this framing instead: How much power should a tech company have *over itself*? Let's imagine a newspaper that sells ad space. I send an offer to the newspaper of their usual fee to advertise my upcoming martials arts training camp for white neo-nazis. Do you think the newspaper should be allowed to decline my offer, even in the absence of competing offers? Would you require the newspaper host content that it has an absolute moral disagreement with? This is similar to a lot of the discussions around Tumblr's anti-nsfw decisions. I tried to think of it in this way: if an imaginary sole owner of Tumblr went onto the site they own and saw their site was being used in ways they didn't want it to be used for, would it be a form of censorship for them to remove the content? If I don't *want* my website to have porn on it, and my users keep posting porn on it, is it censorship for me to start disallowing it?
why is mongodb not cheese?
Great job! Thanks for sharing. Hope you keep developing it into something bigger and better. Just one small suggestgion, to make it more readable on Reddit try indenting each line of your code by 4 spaces on the post. That way it will post it as code. As is you lost all of your indentation on functions and if/else statements.

have you considered using incrond to detect the new image and initiate the script to transfer? Incrond is like cron but always listening. I have used this with rsync over ssh exactly. I used a bash script for the transfer though. I prefer bash for os level stuff like this.
You could do it with Flask and maybe Ajax too but trust me your life would be easier if you used JS for this one.

I don't see this top down, but rather representative. &amp;#x200B; Programming Languages are the meat of the Issue, while databases are quite cheesy.
Awesome work! What’s your next project? Also, if you want to learn more, look at the edX.org (free) classes on Python. Especially from MIT and Georgia Tech.
Finally some good fucking food
Exactly. Nobody uses DB2.
&gt; error handling and making sure the exceptions are helpful Defining error messages so that they are useful was a big step up in cleaner code for myself. Sounds like you're relatively new to Python, but this is already one hell of a step to progressing with Python, or any language really.
Thanks! I wasn't familiar with rsync and wouldn't have thought to look at that as a solution. Looks like that might work well for me, I'll give it a shot.
Huh, I bet it used to work before. Anyways I agree it is not the best approach.
First of all : nice job, really ! I have listed some ideas to add features to your program, but imo you should really just find what YOU want to do and try and develop it :) - Make the program ask the weight and the height and return the result instead of hard-coding it. - Keep a list of the previous bmi for each person - Calculate how much someone need to lose to go back to "not overweight" But again, the most important thing imo is that you pick something that interest you and that you try your best to develop it. That way you'll learn new things or new languages for fun :)
Thank you for your really good ideas
A hamburger with random tech words all over it. &amp;#x200B; okay
Thank you.I think I am going to learn django and make a bmi calculator website and add new features, like input buttons, how many kg has a person to lose and so on.I want to also be a fullstack developer. And imma check out those classes.
looool
Mods, can you please do that thing you talked about, where posts are hidden until they receive a proper flair, and deleted if they never do? Maybe a message send to OP to remind them to read the rules? Any kind of hurdle at all would be a huge improvement.

To add to that, you might also wanna think about hashing the page and only storing the hash in a file and then comparing the hashes.

&gt; Python specifically, no. pip and requirements.txt make it a breeze to manage That is what I thought. Thanks for weighing in.
You are mixing up while- and for-loops here. You decrement your i as if you were using a while loop, for example like this: i = 0 while i&lt;5: #Do something i += 1 You would do this in a while loop because the while loop does only check wether a certain condition (in this case i&lt;5) is true or false, but it does itself not change anything that would make the outcome of that condition change between individual cycles of the loop. So you have to "manually" change the variable that you are checking in your while condition (in that case i). &amp;#x200B; In a for loop however, you don't have to (and also shouldn't) try to change anything about the i variable, since it gets assined a new value from the iterable that you created in the range function. Think of it like the range function creates some sort of list \[0, 1, 2, 3, 4\] and after each cycle of the for loop, i gets assined the next value from that list. So your subtraction of 1 does not do anything in the next cycle.
So fun to watch lol

True, thats why I did suggest flask, not familiar with Plotly Dash so no idea.

About 6 Months ago I started with some little Python projects. Actually I'm a normal Webdeveloper. I'm working with HTML, PHP, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery and then I found flask. I was completely overwhelmed with it and made a really small website, but I didn't see for what I should use it. A few days ago I came across flask again and found this awesome tutorial. I'm done with part 7 now. He explains everything really good and also the quality is fantastic. If you're also a flask beginner oder maybe even intermediate I can really recommend you this tutorial from Corey Schafer. Please bear with typos or grammar mistakes (I'm form Germany and still attending school :)
I guess I should mentioned one caveat to this -- if it's a Python package that's not available precompiled (meaning you have to build it on your system yourself), then it may require some OS packages to be installed. But you should be aware of what those are ahead of time I would think.
One could just as easily argue that you've pre-empted *any* argument. If you say built solutions aren't allowed, and source solutions aren't allowed, then what *would* you allow as a solution? And I'm not a fan of Docker by any means, but it does seem like a lot of services are standardizing on "just give us a Docker image" as a solution for any language these days.

Try them then it's good to learn new things, flask is an important lib to know with python. &amp;#x200B; Regarding JS 2 reasons come to mind: 1. Greater reason, i'm sort of a purist so whenever i can do something related to the original i tend to try, for example if i read a book i try to get the original if i speak the language, back to this example if you're already working with HTML and the browser and there is a language for execution which is JS, it makes more sense to stick with the same context, i think it's more elegant this way. 2. Lesser reason, I'm old school, in my time i worked with some of the older languages and versions, i got burned a few times mixing things up like mixing 2 languages so i try to avoid this, it usually causes a mess and a headache, permission issues etc..

Performance is a red herring. If people really put as much weight on performance in their real-world language choices as they claim to in internet discussions, we'd see a lot more trendy web services written in C or assembly. The truth is that a lot of languages that are derided as "slow" are actually just "slow*er*", which is not the same as "*too* slow". Python, Ruby, PHP, even JavaScript are all slower than other things you could choose, but not so slow that they're untenable choices. Same mostly goes for static typing. [The empirical evidence one way or another is mostly not there, or beset by methodological issues or too-small effect sizes](https://danluu.com/empirical-pl/). The idea that you can't successfully write anything more than a trivial tiny puny baby child's Fisher-Price "My First Code" toy program in a dynamically-typed language, however, is empirically verifiably false. Same for basically all the cliché stuff people trot out in these threads. Python's biggest disadvantage is lack of a convincing story for skating to where the puck is going. Which is of course something of an unknown, but is trending more heavily toward mobile, and Python on mobile is not great right now (despite a lot of work being done by some understaffed and underfunded projects -- pick one and help them out, if you can).
Apparently it's some [`virtualenv` problem](https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/1380)
It is kinda weird. The world needs more programers. I hope to become a coding guru someday 😆😆
better use linux. for macos and linux most python programs are cross compatible.
I mean many people have gotten on here and given me some great advice and even showed me that I can access the book I BOUGHT for free? So I was able to cancel my physical copy order. Like this is the exact reason I got on this Reddit and posted this. I need help, and people came flying in with amazing advice.
Remember Google's [abomination unto the lord](https://blog.emojipedia.org/google-fixes-burger-emoji/) that had the cheese under the patty? In the alternate reality where that's a burger, this database cheese would make more sense.

Yes, python is the same across the board. Developing python programs will be slightly different though if that makes sense. For example, pip install and other terminal/command line stuff is different. Pathways tend to be structured different too. Those are examples and I'm sure others can contribute. That being said, those are all a Stackoverflow thread away whereas building fundamental fluency in python will not change between them.
Docker should be the plate
&gt; Spend some time learning all the basics e.g. for/while loops, syntax, arrays etc and then do a project to learn more advanced things. Nobody could ever conduct a conversation in a foreign language on politics without being very comfortable know how to ask where the bathroom is. Baby steps.
Oh hi Seattle
&gt; This was my very first program, on a very long journey. The problem with these is that you're asking for (and everyone with similar posts) recognition of your start with the enthusiasm of crossing the finish line. Maybe you'll be some savant on this thing, maybe not. But you can't get the applause until you win the gold.
Thanks for the insight! I guess I’ll be starting on my Mac, I was worried windows was the best route and I was considering waiting to start learning till I built my pc
Is this a plugin for Python toturial, or a toturial of Python itself?
&gt;I myself do not know how to reconcile disinformation and hate speech in the modern world with people's general unintelligence. You could grow up and just stop caring
How so? Docker requires an OS to run on top of.
I'm a beginner and I don't care for these "look at me" posts. They don't make any third parties any better, and they're asking for recognition for something they haven't done yet (learning and becoming proficient with the language). I mean, let's look at beginner vs just begun. I've made a system that takes in a json file with some parameters such as employee #s, names, and links to s3 objects for pictures, and it spits out a pdf that is sent to an ID badge printer. It runs multi-threaded when appropriate, and resizes fonts to fit dimensions for variable length of names. I've made a system that takes in the polygons of county plot records converts those coordinates to lon/lat, does similar with USDA data, and figures out in a county how many acres of what crops are being grown by whom. I've made a multi-threaded/non-blocking network server that listens for GPS devices to report their location/statuses, takes that, decodes from binary to json, and stuffs into a database. Or we have a Hello World four-liner. I know my code isn't great, it's not pretty, and someone better could probably make it better. But I did those things, and I'm better than I was. I don't ask for applause, because the fact that I don't need to outsource these things is self-applause enough. I've made myself 10x more valuable to my company than a year or two ago. My next one is starting to delve into data science (data analysis, visualization, and eventually machine learning for predictive modelling). And there'll likely be no applause, and that's ok. The questions I ask, with pointers to the right documentation are what I like about this and /r/learnpython . The feedback is much better that way, and when others do similar, I learn from their problems before they've had a chance to become my problem. If you need the applause to keep you going after the first page of the first chapter of your first python book, you're in for a rough ride, because if you start submitting a new post every time you learn about lists, dictionaries, etc, you're going to have a bad time.
Ok, in the process of writing this up, I was able to find the error. The \\'s in the byte string need to be escaped.

What?
It's not uncommon to create a class that *has-a* built-in data structure. For instance, an ORM will have a class that represents a query, and once the query has been run, the query object will have a list of the rows that were returned. In such a case, you'll sometimes find that the calling code looks better if your class implements the special methods to pass those operations on to the internal data structure. For example, instead of writing `query.results[0]` (which makes the name `results` part of your API contract), you could write `query[0]` to get the first result. Sometimes it even makes sense to do some housekeeping before or after the forwarded operation. In Django, `query[0]` will send the query to the database if the list of cached results doesn't exist yet. But you can still use that query object anywhere you could use a built-in list, and callers can use it without having to care whether the objects are coming from the database or from a cached list in memory.
Thanks for the update. Does the 30k basically mean you can upload and analyze at any ratio? My understanding is you need to algorithmize a base photo and then one can run an analysis. So you might upload 10,000 photos and then run a set of 5,000 photos against the original set. This would leave you with 15,000 more photos to analyze against the base set.
Of course, do you serve your meal directly on to the table? You put the plate on top of your table, so you can move you meal to whatever place you want regardless of the kind of table

[https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science#) 2. you don't need book 3. depends on what you want to do, if talk in common you need to know: \- how to setup dev. environment(linux + ide + plugins) \- how to work with github \- know python(syntax, pep8, builtin modules, etc) \- basic CS \- maybe some kind of how web works(OSI, HTML\\CSS\\JS) 4. nothing. you don't need any certification if you can do thing. better certification is your own pet project on github or opensource activity.
FORTRAN was my first language and i know you're just pulling the pudd but its still up there in my heart
I second these answers and have a second resource for starting to learn in addition. Check out https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-computer-science--cs101
Excellent !!
Hmm, interesting. Would you say what you mentioned is considered standard "pythonic"? In my previous experience, I would treat the query and the results completely separately. My query object would be an immutable representation of just the query, nothing else, without the ability to run anything. Instead the execution behavior is handled by an engine, for example: `results = db.run(query)`. If I wanted to look up the results, I'd run the query and examine the results list, and I wouldn't touch query again unless I needed to reuse the actual query, so the responsibilities are completed separated. Caching is done explicitly by me rather than implicitly by the query object. Would you say this way is "unpythonic" and instead I should change my approach in python to be more stateful?
You've never created a derived class based on a collection before? This sort of thing is very common in e.g. .net languages like C#. It allows you to make use of the collection methods and properties, but also add your own for specific use cases. What actually constitutes being "pythonic" is a bit of a moving target. That term is usually reserved for doing things using idiomatic python - like using list comprehensions instead of normal loops over collections or ranges. It becomes much more hazy when you try to equate being pythonic with implementing specific patterns for specific problems. If you don't have a good reason to subclass a list, then there's no reason to do so simply because someone believes it's more 'pythonic'. That just adds unnecessary code. There are good use cases for it though. Don't be so concerned with 'pythonic', except when it comes to the core mantra of PEP 20: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/
Both work. Is the latter considered more pythonic? Or faster?
I would advise using kivy, it's easy enough to load images with it, and move them around, with or without animations, and it allows for touch interactions as well as mouse, wich is kind of nice if you want to play your card game on a tablet. It's well suited for such 2D projects.
I'm still confused in my post where I've asked for recognition or applause. All I said was wish me luck! I posted this here to start conversations on something I've never tried, simply because I heard the python community is very welcoming and helpful. Obviously some are not. Other than this thread everyone has been super friendly and helpful, so thanks for nothing.
I see where you are coming from. Now we need the table too....
I don’t know why this is so hard for people to understand, you just need to think of it a bit more categorically. From bottom up: Bottom bun=platforms Meat=backend Cheese=data. May as well add json, yaml, etc Pickles=APIs Top bun=front end Lots of solid analogies at every level if you ask me! How pedantic, unfun, and lacking in creativity are we as a group that we collectively say this makes no sense?
Linux and MacOS tend to have better tooling in the open source world, unless you’re into .NET. MacOS is an obvious good (though relatively expensive) choice, especially for iOS users, and you can always run VMs on it if you want Linux (Eg for docker) or windows.
As far as I know it has never worked. The linked PEP, which introduced relative imports, gives the reasoning for why it isn't allowed. The name `package.foo` from the absolute import `import package.foo` is directly usable in a Python expression. But `.foo` from `import .foo` would not be usable in a Python expression. Using `from . import foo` results in `foo` in the namespace, which is usable in a Python expression.
Found Guido's alt account.
Nicely done. How come there are blank spaces on the bottom left and top right?
There is nothing wrong with your approach. I think you are overthinking this. Pythonic is about your code architecture really, but how you achieve it. Utilizing the magic methods to get something done, making object behavior inherent, rather then additive, is considered Pythonic. What problems you actually solve doing this is up to you. Sometimes a problem is best solved with an object that is iterative, sometimes you want the object to be a context manager, etc... That's really all it is.
Nice mate, it was also one of my first projects! Maybe try to add other features like asking for user input, or telling in which category a person is (if you look it up, people can be divided by their BMI in underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese I, obese II, obese III). &amp;#x200B; Other project you might want to consider is a calculator to transform Celsius into Fahrenheit. Look up the formula and give it a go!
Recently finished an intro to Python course and I'm just working on a basic inventory management system. I wanted more practice with classes so it's very class heavy. It's been kicking my ass but I have learned a great deal!
I think you could also use rb (raw byte strings)
This was far more helpful in some ways than your other comment. This is a hobby for now but I'd like to get into AI.
Pygame for ease of use, very simple to use. I recommend it over Kivy, Kivy can be overwhelming at first.
this is legit!
&gt; I'm still confused in my post where I've asked for recognition or applause. Your very submission is karma whoring. That is asking for applause. &gt;I heard the python community is very welcoming and helpful. It is. OMFG, it really is. But you didn't ask for help. Your post is Stuart from MadTV saying "look at what I can do!". Sorry, I know that sounds dickish, but my frustration isn't with you, it's with all the posts like it, on this and other subs. Satisfaction for time well spent, for real accomplishment doesn't come from others, it comes from yourself. Do something that doesn't make you proud to show others. Do something that makes you realize that you've contributed to the world, you've made the lives of others better.
FORTRAN and COBOL are special to me. When I was trying to get into schools I was told to “teach yourself to code,” and the only relevant books at my local library were those two, already old and worn and disintegrating by the time I got them. Not knowing any better, I “taught” myself FORTRAN and COBOL without ever having touched a computer.
Yes, both work. Not sure if `not in` is faster (certainly not slower), but it is more Pythonic, since it's a built-in part of the syntax.
And that's good, that's how it starts. But I'm proof you don't have to be Guido's little brother to do something cool. Find an itch, and see if you can scratch it. If you can define the problem in english (or some verbal language), along with the tasks you'd give to a minion to accomplish it, you're 90% of the way there.
&gt; You've never created a derived class based on a collection before? This sort of thing is very common in e.g. .net languages like C#. It allows you to make use of the collection methods and properties, but also add your own for specific use cases. Not in the FP style I'm used to. Scala has a pretty powerful collection package that pretty much always contains what I want, and the cases where I'd use custom collections would be complex enough to involve using a dedicated library instead (like a distributed list, perhaps). If I wanted to create a behavior for a list of something, it was always preferable to just create a function using it than creating a new class with that function. i.e. an external function `def convert(input: List[Type1]): List[Type2]` is preferable to `Type1List.convert`. So composing existing behavior explicitly, rather than creating a new type that emulates things. Now I have implemented my own Monad types before, but that feels pretty different from how the "pythonic" philosophy in the book approaches it. In FP, you'd want to implement your custom Monad types in order to be able to compose them together, whereas in Python implementing your own custom type seems to be more similar to inheritance where you want to look/feel like something but do things differently, and composition isn't a major factor. Or am I wrong about that? &gt; If you don't have a good reason to subclass a list, then there's no reason to do so simply because someone believes it's more 'pythonic'. That just adds unnecessary code. I agree, the book just didn't explain why you'd want to do the things it suggested so I was curious what people here thought. My intuition was that the "good reason" to subclass a list in python is something that I didn't encounter in my previous environments.
Great work!
Look man I'm foreal just a lurker on Reddit and I am proud that I've finally started, I wanted to make a quick post on Python to show people I was a beginner so I could get some conversation going. I'm sorry for those posts you've seen but it's less about just wanting attention, and more about wanting information that I would have had otherwise. I'm teaching myself with books and the like and no one around me codes, so I just wanted a place I could come and ask questions because I don't have anyone else to ask. I understand I could have went about it differently but I just wanted to make a quick post and this one did the trick! I feel as if I've accomplished nothing also! I literally just started from scratch officially yesterday, I have much to learn. Sorry I struck a nerve, I understand what you mean.

I've done a LOT more bash than python in the last 9 months, and that is just how it came out of my brain :)

Thank you, I appreciate your perspective. I am probably overthinking it, mainly because as the book said, "many experienced programmers try to bend python to fit patterns they learned from other languages, and never discover python features outside of their experience", so I wanted to make sure I'm not committing that mistake while learning the real "pythonic" patterns. Especially since the book also expounds on how Python is not designed for FP so I'm likely being overly paranoid about committing faux-pas in bringing in too much "bad" FP practices. Also, do you mind expanding on why utilizing the magic methods is considered pythonic? From what I'm reading it's faster to using built-in types, so I was curious what the exact reasons are for eschewing them. I'm guessing enforcing statefulness and type restrictions?
nevermind i fixed it :P
I did that exact project under 3 minutes
Foreal wish I had a friend knowledgeable on coding (even in the slightest) like yourself. One of the big reasons I'd love to go to school for this type of thing is to meet others (literally anyone) who are interested in this topic. Partly the reason I posted here. Question you may not know, but does information technology cover programing at all? And if so in what depth, I've been wanting to go to school and there is a good 2 year program for IT. Just curious if I'd learn about programming while in a course like that?
TBF if you're running 1/3 of that skillset making 16.5 I pity you.
That only makes me wonder why they listed specific RDBMS and then "nosql" even more.
I think you could also do value = r"\x0112".encode()
I don't see a single cryptocurrency or a reference to block chain. When was this made, the dark ages?! (the /s should be obvious, but explicit rather than implicit)
TBH, I have no idea. I've just been doing computer and CLEC telecom stuff for the last 20 years, worked my way up from just a high school education. Lots of self-study in that time. FWIW though, I've met brilliant programmers that are self-taught, and idiots that showed they could study for a test but never apply the knowledge (with a degree). Degrees are good if you actually take the time to learn what you need with learning as the goal, not just a couple letters to impress a recruiter. If you do better with IRL help, check out your local python/programming meetup groups. Even if you don't get a python expert, a good programmer will understand the fundamentals of program logic, debugging, etc, and be able to help you work through your problems. If you do have a python meetup group, GO!! One in my area has everything from people who are just starting, to guys that have been/are python release managers. IOW, guys smart enough I can't even think of a programming question that would stump them. Not that I'd say go to the top for each of your questions, but more saying that you can definitely find the right person with the experience/skill and domain knowledge for your questions/roadblocks.
I fully agree!!! I myself was in a similar situation a few months ago (until I realised our school has a programming club) and found it very encouraging to see other people starting to code on the internet. To give context, this encouraged me enough that I now have done a few projects to do with encryption and have recreated an enigma machine, have started on pygame and am starting to become able enough to attempt to think up my own projects and plan and design them. Resources which helped me a lot were Code academy, and actually Reddit. Btw, I would probably use VS Code for my code, or simply use the integrated IDLE which comes with python install, but that is personal choice. Would check them out though, they have nice features (though less so IDLE).
Understandable! Just don't commit the crazy sins I've seen at work such as: * `if container.__contains__(item)` * `if condition is False:` (which, fun fact, is becoming a SyntaxWarning soon, and will eventually be a SyntaxError)
I want a book because it is easier for me to process information written on a page that I can turn to when I need to refer to it.

YO HOW DID YOU DO THIS? I wanna do this :O !!!
Nice!
I don't know that I understand the problem with the second one. &amp;#x200B; If I have a function, for example, that returns True or False depending what it does, wouldn't: &amp;#x200B; If is\_it\_sunny is False: raise\_car\_top &amp;#x200B; Be correct? &amp;#x200B; Or do you mean more like: &amp;#x200B; if (a == b) is False: look\_confused
Thanks for the advice! Glad to hear I'm not the only one who's excited to learn about coding. Everything it's already done for our world, imagine if everyone learned how to code!
Dude thanks for the advice! And yes I plan on actually learni g the materials and applying it myself somewhere somehow. Lately I've been thinking about what programing could do to help my everyday problems, and trying to obviously figure out how coding works in the first place. As of now I've hardly even scratched the surface, if anything I'm just looking at the surface and I understand that. Since this post I've spent about 7 hrs total learning about the syntax and functions and all that. I've gotten to the stripping of whitespace with strip(). I know I've got such a long climb ahead, so looking into those meet ups I will definitely do!
Python doesn't have arrays as part of the standard library.
you guys know this can be used to ruin women's social lives, right? Nevermind the actual weirdos that would use something like this regularly... The fuck is wrong with you people? I expected way more from this community.
no the fuck it isn't. nobody should be faking nudes of anyone, nor invading their privacy by using other people's pictures without their knowledge to search up information on them. It's fucking disgusting.
Then I would fake a nude photo of Sara Hukabee Sanders and would superimpose a bucket of fried chicken where her head was supposed to be and give her confederate flag stripper heels.
For your first example, this would be more correct: if not is_it_sunny: raise_car_top() The naming of that variable makes that read weird, so this would be an improvement: if not sunny: raise_car_top() Using bash as a model, that's more or less like: if ! grep -q sunny ./weather ; then raise_car_top ; fi And for the second example: if a != b: look_confused() The reason `is False` or `is True` is frowned upon is because you should just be checking for "truthiness". You almost never actually want the low level behavior of `is True` - because that asks "is this value that I have, literally the value `True`?" when you almost always mean "is this value not a falsy value (False, None, 0, empty)".
who hurt you?
Something controversial? Not on my Reddit!
Thanks for posting! Also a web dev getting into Python, this looks great.
Probably a pretty fun and visual way to learn about multithreading too, get the number of threads available on a system, break the image down into blocks, assign a turtle to each block on its own thread.

If I was going to create something that had never been done before every time I wrote a program or web app, I'd probably be here today with no experience in how to do anything. That's not to sound snarky, but I wanted to write this just to see if it's something I'm capable of doing and thereby sort of broadening my skill set as well as being able to place it on my resume. Plus something light weight that could perform such a small task could possibly appeal to people I think, but that's not really my intention. Anyway, do you have any answers to my initial post by chance?
the code is correct. It prints ['0 1\n', '0 2\n', '\n'] the issue must be in the file being passed to read.
Statefulness yes, type restrictions isn't really something you worry about in Python. Just add it in the doc string. So again, don't over think it, there is a reason to use a programming pattern, that is designed to best solve a problem. That is still going to be true. But if you come from Java and are using getters and setters everywhere, well that is just wrong in Python. All methods are public anyway, and you can access attributes directly, so don't do that. And the same applies not using magic methods. Lots of people get stuck using nothing but the `__init__` method when writing their classes and fail to see the possibilities of the rest of them. Which is really the point the book is trying to present. As to your specific issue, remember that, where a function is encapsulation of code, a Class is an encapsulation of Data. A function DOES something, a class IS something. So yes, making an object that can be iterated like a list is a super common operation in Python, rather then putting that data into a list. The if the data is going to be referenced a lot, and the state of that data matters at runtime, it should absolutely love in its own object, and perform operations on itself. It doesn't make your query approach wrong, but I think in terms of databases where the state does not change at runtime, it is a perfectly valid approach.
I have heard of "turtle" butbi have never seen that before

From my understanding, the extension needs to run locally in the user's browser, so no. You could do this with JavaScript, though. Look into puppeteer.

any of the O'Reilly books are fine for reference (particularly recommend the python cookbook and the comprehensive python reference). That being said, you just don't learn programming very well by using a book. It'll go in one ear and go out the next. I would recommend the following instead: &amp;#x200B; Step 1. Learn the basic programming concepts/(cs?) that are universal: how memory and data structures work, how functions work, how object-oriented programming works, how binary works, how algorithms work and the basic ones. If it's in C, if it's in Python, it doesn't really matter tbh. A lot of people can eventually make a garbage program that does what you want using a ton of resources. Optimizing that program puts you in a different league imo. For this, there is nothing better than Harvard's free CS50 course (that I have found). &amp;#x200B; Step 2. Do a project. You just won't absorb by going through chapters of a book. Nothing clicks like a program working after several errors and trips to online forums. Go trial and error using the reference book and using the online forums (Stackoverflow). &amp;#x200B; Good luck
Great work. Some ideas: - Your code seems to repeat some of the same things such as the calls to `bmi_calculator` and printing the results. Look into the `list` type and `for` loops. With this you could make the code shorter, easier to read, and make it easier to add more family members. - As others mentioned, the data is currently hardcoded. You could get the data from the user, or perhaps save to a `json` file. - You might consider tracking weight changes over time and storing those in the file mentioned above. - More advanced, but maybe with the weight changes over time you could chart them with `matplotlib` or similar. Keep up the good work!
So everyone's equal, but some are more equal than others?
Probably a quick five-liner in Javascript
Ah, fair enough. It's amusing, "A function DOES something, a class IS something" is why in FP we would want to separate data from behavior (have logic live outside of data representations), but I supposed in a stateful world different strategies are needed. Alright, looks like in Python I need to change my approach to be more stateful. Thanks!
Isn't what? Isn't a get out of jail free card? Your argument doesn't rebut that claim. You just wished for a world where no one ever does anything unethical. Well I've got news for you, reality doesn't work like that. So, given that (real) nudes do get leaked, and amateur pornos are getting deanonymised, I would much rather live in a world where when this happens to you, you don't get fired or stigmatized for it, because you can claim it isn't real.
Exactly were my worries. The extension consists of html, css, and js as well and while there are apparently transpilers that convert python to javascript, I doubt they'd adapt to something like selenium. Anyway, I feel dumb for assuming selenium to be the only thing that exists of its kind. So thank you for pointing out puppeteer to me. Seems like it's something I should've been using all along! and /thread
I'd find what that checkbook connects to, then us any number of pythons modules https://datatofish.com/how-to-connect-python-to-ms-access-database-using-pyodbc/
name will be the first line of the input. The *line will absorb everything else beyond that from the input. The input is being split into subsequent lines
it's a great job, so cool. I'd like to ask, is it possible to replicate the image but change the pixel value by some criteria like if R value&gt;x then the pixel become green, etc?
Ohk thanks a lot kind stranger
sure thing. I should clarify, "lines" is anything that is type and separated via a space. &amp;#x200B; For example: name, *line = input().split print(name) print(line) will prompt for input with no context. You can type anything into that prompt. This is my sample input message this will output This ['is', 'my', 'smaple', 'input', 'message']
You have been a great help :)
haha that's pretty great. I refuse to look at it, though! Okay, I peeked. I'm just stunned that 2 years into web development nobody has mentioned anything about triggering events in pure vanilla javascript. Unfortunately, Event.initEvent() is deprecated so that code specifically might not work, but this provided me with everything I need for sure. dare I say /thread?
Don't post screenshots of code. Use https://pastebin.com/ or similar to post code. Check your input file for Windows line endings, e.g. CR+LF instead of just LF.
Not at all interested in the specific application. But does anybody know if this contained some new ideas/concepts or applies GAN in a novel way? It was reported as far better performing than the previous Deep Fake tools. Is that just because of natural advancement in the technology or did the author come up with something new?

Here’s the link to the [code](https://github.com/alexalbertt/turtlepix?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)
What are you talking about? This is a software that uses one or more algorithms, the nerve gas analogy is completely wrong here. An algorithm does not care what you feed to it, it will give the output based on input. This particular version was trained on nude photos and thus generated nudes. But since it is an algorithm so it should be fairly easy to take it and use it for a completely different application and if it is any good that could be really useful. As far as I know this was based on [pix2pix](https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix) which had lots of useful application. If this makes any improvements on that (in terms of performance, accuracy etc.) then there is no reason it can't be put into good use.
Yeah, using Pillow(the imported image processing module) you can do all sorts of image manipulation
Not 100% sure why that occurs. I’m guessing it’s due to a bug in retrieving the RGB value at those coordinates
I have the graphics for a pack of cards with jokers and back cover if that would help you. They are public domain. I used them in my (badly coded) Tkinter card game. https://stevepython.wordpress.com/2018/11/14/gui-card-game-completed
&gt;This is a software that uses one or more algorithms, the nerve gas analogy is completely wrong here. Nerve gas is made of one or more chemicals thus it is okay to let everyone have nerve gas. &gt; This particular version was trained on nude photos and thus generated nudes. This particular creation required a number of additional features in order to function specifically in order to create nudes. But the pedigree of the program is irrelevant. Github has no reason to support a project specifically dedicated to creating fake nude photos of people and every reason to not support it.
The Python packaging system (and to be fair Python is not alone here) is a big motivation for using Docker. I don't have to deal with virtualenvs or pyenv or any of that nonsense. tl;dr Docker exists because package and dependency management with languages like Python is a massive PITA.
Which will come first the Year of the Linux Desktop or the Year that Python gets rid of the GIL.
This is really cool! I cloned the project and I plan to look through the code and refactor/expand on it tomorrow. I've done a small amount of work with PIL myself, creating a script that places an image of your choice inside a Grateful Dead "Steely".
There’s something you can do to phase cancel stereo audio by duplicating it and flipping it to leave the mono.
Why does this sound like one of those that drank the "Everyone should learn to code" things lol....Coding will not save the world man lol....Unless you have an actual reason to learn to do it there's no point. If you're actually going to be a developer have at it. If you're just doing it to do it you're probably better off spending energy on something more productive.
This sort of repitition is a perfect use case to learn the basics of classes.
This would be great for those Minecraft art memes that were floating around a couple months ago lol
use pyodbc to speak with the Access driver. Then just send an update statement to the database. Figure out which table contains the checkbox.
Looks like you can use the Google Maps [api](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/intro) to get distances and times, looks like you've got quite a few options with it as well. I didn't look in to their billing, though, but the API is pretty straightforward to use, send a request and you get json back. I've used some of the Google geocoding APIs before, pretty easy to use and convenient
NEVER post pictures of code. Copy and paste or don't post. Also, this belongs in /r/LearnPython
In an Access database, that checkbox may or may not be bound to a database record. We don't know the use case. Even of that checkbox IS bound to a database record, updating the corresponding record with pyodbc may not help you at all. It entirely depends on how that database is being used. Is there an event handler on that checkbox? Is there other validation or code that is doing important things you care about based on the value of that checkbox? None of that code will run if you simply update a database record behind the scenes.
I plan to learn about AI, I would like to make something education oriented. I have to educate myself further.
Every email service ever lets you just create rules for that shit
I know. It was a joke about how he’ll forever be our BFDL in our hearts and stuff. Come on buddy. (っ･ω･)っ
No... You've to put in effort.
That's almost literally minimum wage in Seattle. I was just commenting on the orca card
Something like this: https://github.com/kovacsbalu/WazeRouteCalculator ? Do a quick search for "Waze Python API" or similar and you'll find what you need eventually.
OpenRouteService is free and has an OK python interface. Gets upset if you make too many requests too fast, though.

Corey Schafer is the best. Love his videos.
Thanks for the pointing me in the right direction, Microsoft's python language server seems to do most of what I want.
I can't find any turtle in the result pic. j/k, nicely done man.
You could use https://asciinema.org/
Hi, you can use online Python IDEs to show your code and results, e.g. [https://trinket.io/features/python3](https://trinket.io/features/python3) or [http://www.codeskulptor.org](http://www.codeskulptor.org/)
I found his channel only a few days before, but I also love it!
As long as people keep answering here, nothing will change. Sad but true. But of course I totally agree with you. And posting Screenshot imho is not only kinda lazy but also disrespectful towards the passion of programming.
Can you link to your code?
Awesome Work, keep it up!
Or if you don't have it anymore you could probably whip it up in like 30 seconds this time around, right?
Is the filling "on purpose" where you could do it faster/all at once, or is it hardware related?
I've seen people use repl.it but I am not familiar with it. Maybe check that out to see if it fills your needs.

I find this project really cool. I cloned it and run through some of my photos but the problem that I'm facing is, I couldn't control to what resolution the generated image will be scaled to. I understand 1x will not be possible but how can I control the resolution of the result image so that I get to decide the level of detail on the generated image?
Hey guys, there’s this cool experimental language that’s getting out of beta called Python! I’m going to try it out when I have the time tomorrow.

You can turn it into a .exe using pyinstaller.
Honestly the output was very poor. Someone with decent photoshop skills can probably do a lot better with the given images in their library.
You're suggesting they're better at reading code?
Yes, our benevolent for dictator life :p
I need it... https://twitter.com/deepnudeservice
Sorry I meant lists
It's like someone was trying to write an example of how not to Python. Inputs need explanations, also, don't use cryptic variable names: `number_of_students = int(input('How many students?'))` Another potential source of confusion is _, try for example: `for student_index in range(number_of_students):` Explain what you want: `name, *line = input(f"Enter student {student_index + 1}'s data in the form of name score_1 score_2, e.g. Brian 79 99").split()` In other cases it would make sense to be explicit with your string separator: `split(' ')` This time I'm not recommending it because the default (any whitespace) makes it so you don't have to strip() for double spaces, etc. This is elegant but novices don't understand it: `scores = list(map(float, line))` Maybe do: ``` scores = [] for score_string in line: scores.append(float(score_string)) ``` You may not want to bring error-prone floating point math into this: round(0.625, 2) Out[15]: 0.62 round(0.635, 2) Out[16]: 0.64 Maybe use 'scores as cents' and integers? Like 99.99 -&gt; 9999? Then again it may not be important in this case. But with money it would be and extremely so. Again the input explanation: `query_name = input('Query about whom? ')` Generally all languages but English are a big no-no in programming, but if you do know one, using it can be a boon to learning. That way you'll understand what is arbitrary and what is syntax very well. For example: `nom_complet, *ligne = input('??? ').split(' ')`
Yes but if you learn by applying, not just reading a book. Just like when we were younger, reading a book about how to build Lego would be ok but you probably wouldn’t retain much. Now going to play with the Lego and learn as you build is much more useful. Same applies to languages and programming. ‘You learn as you do’

I started learning Python last year. I discovered him 3 months after starting. Wish I would I have known about him when I first starter, it would have made learning the basics soo much easier.
Pyfftw
**Pyglet** is also an option as it makes working with sprites, user input and displaying text easy.
They're all perverts. I've been saying the exact same thing for years about social media, smart phones, cameras etc. All of the above have been used time and time again to ruin lives and none of them should exist. Don't even get me started on the internet. The internet has ruined so many lives it's unreal. But if I say the internet should be banned *I'm* the crazy one? If we give people the tools they need to record and distribute potentially embarrassing information we might as well just start raping and murdering because we're just as bad as the ones who use them for nefarious purposes.
Its should be illegal because we've been told anything that offends feminists is worst than satan. Back in the land of reality this is simply a tool that does the same thing that you could do with photoshop or even a pencil, just maybe a little faster. And there is nothing that decrees it has to be used exclusively on women for nefarious purposes.
won't somebody think of the pixels!
It happens when the width of the picture passes the height of the picture, so the bug should be in that part of your calculations. Looks like a fun project!
Hi there, Coincidentally, I'm working on a simple Blackjack game in Python 3 which I posted a few days ago. I've got it to a playable state albeit with a few bugs. It might give you a few ideas even though it uses no graphics libraries, just print statements. You can download it here: [https://pastebin.com/WvmEtZDg](https://pastebin.com/WvmEtZDg) The output looks something like this: ---DEALER--- +---+ +---+ |♣ | |♠ | | 8 | | T | | ♣| | ♠| +---+ +---+ Chips: 110 Hand value: 18 ---PLAYER 1--- +---+ +---+ +---+ |♠ | |♥ | |♥ | | 3 | | 7 | | 8 | | ♠| | ♥| | ♥| +---+ +---+ +---+ Chips: 90 Hand value: 18 ***DEALER WINS!*** On a side note, you can use the turtle module to display .gif images - it's pretty easy to do, compared to some other alternatives. Good luck!
use a jupyter notebook and export it to html.
Good job on coding it. Now I have this post in addition to my wife to tell me I'm obese :(
This is exactly the type of project that might not seem impactful at first sight. Yet I am glad I got a notification to check this out. It is a really neat challenge to replicate this/improve on it. I haven't worked with any GUI or graphics at all in Python, and I have been learning Python for a couple of months now. Thanks for the inspiration!
True. I couldn't find a good channel for beginners.

It seems like you went for a pretty hardcore functional approach to Scala, which means you missed out on things like traits. If you did this in Scala you wouldn't be saying "I'm making a class that's like `List`", you'd be saying "I'm making a class that implements the `Indexable` and `Iterable` traits". Same basic idea, but with less formal declaration, in Python: your class isn't "like a list". Multiple built-in types in Python are iterable and indexable, not just `list`. And you're writing another type that's iterable and indexable. Also it's not really worth worrying about the performance implications. Some of Python's built-in types do get to do some fancy things, yes, but that's because the language itself uses them all over and as a result they *have* to have hand-optimized implementations down in the C code of the interpreter just to let Python's own base performance as a language be bearable.
Thank you for the ideas
Thank you
oh I am going to try that one for sure.
Nice, btw do you guys know alternatives to endtest? I mean codless automation tool?
Since you are going to study computer science. Maybe invest some time and effort in trying yourself instead of immediately asking help and posting in the wrong sub.
Agreed, just giving an analogy. My point was that anyone with those rockstar ideas for their first project can't do the basics you laid out, they're never going to get off the ground. If they marginally do, it'll look like someone ran their code through the python version of Google translate. Probably would run about as well.
What you need is not another fft, what you need is multithreading. Split your workload into multiple threads and call the fft on each. Since most of numpy is actually C or Fortran, you probably can use multithreading module.

Either parallelize the FFT (First two splits or so fork) internally or externally (one process per fft) Or implement the fft in Rust or something like that (super easy interface to python) and call it from Python
That's hilarious.
Nltk or smth Like that. It's for natural language Processing and there's a free O'Reillys book called "Natural language Processing with nltk and Python" or smth Like that
can I do the multithreading within Python? I am quite new to Python... &amp;#x200B; I have several GPUs at my dispense which I assume could come in handy as well
Thanks, your girlfriend's pic is now on DeepNude's creator server.
It might be more efficient to modify the query with a lower in the field that you need lowercase. Most dbs support it
What is?
The bot reply on your question. Maybe it's just me..
Fellow Python beginner here also. I started with courses on DataCamp and EdX for two weeks now. Do you have any other sources for education and applying the theory in practice? Would be happy to stay in touch with you!

Two possible ideas for programs that are useful and could be built up iteratively: - a macro tool: a cli tool that lets you select snippets of code or text or passwords or whatever, through command line prompts - a note app: a cli (or gui... Or eventually both!) App for taking, sorting, and looking up notes Either of those could start off really simple taking input and output through `input` and `print`, writing data to and from text files, and progress from there Expand the app from working on flat lists of notes/macros to working on arbitrarily sized tree structures to teach data structures and complex conditional or recursive logic Expand IO from print and input functions to something like `click` or `prompt_toolkit`, or maybe add an http rest API to your app to access your notes / macros through a web client / mobile app Expand data management from text files up through pickles, through to SQLite, through to manually interfacing with an SQL server / using an ORM library or interfacing with a NoSQL database I feel like there are more possibilities for expanding this app, but I'm drawing a blank right now
What, you don't use cheat cheets? How is that even possible? For data science with Python I use the ones of [datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/community/data-science-cheatsheets), just browse through it, for the ones that interest you.
Now match the colors to a DMC color chart and you have a cross stitch pattern generator!
How is that even possible? Ha ha 😁😁 It is very much possible with Python. Python has built-in cheat sheets. And then there is the internet. Who cares about cheat sheet when you have the interpreter?
Eh I don’t really think that turtle is good for these things Turtle is mostly for drawing stuff PyGame has more stuff to do with it
You should learn to use the built-in help functions. Available in the interpreter: help and dir functions. I don't remember others but there are probably a few more of them.
Google for "GPGPU with python", there might by something but I'd imagine that you need to write CUDA or CL for it. Other than that: multithreading in python doesn't use multiple cores (in CPython - the Story ist different with PyPy, IronPython etc.) - you need to use multiprocessing (more overhead, a tiny bit more complicated but it's manageable. If you really want the performance and true multithreading I'd really use rust to write a library for Python that provides a parallelized FFT
I always found making my own cheat sheet guaranteed my mastery of the material.
I did something similar that draws it line by line. I'll have to find my code
doesn't it only work when you remember the name of functions tho?
How about "I have no mouth but I was banned on Reddit".py ?
No, you don't have to remember anything. It's a really beautiful feature of Python that is often overlooked. You can get the map of the whole language if you like. Just start by typing help in the interpreter.
I just google everything when I need to use it, never have to memorize anything besides the basics. (terrible, I know)
Very very very interesting! Thanks for posting! By the way, there are still some Russian words down the page, around the end of the article in the tables!
Yep It's called "Stackoverflow"!
I just forwarded this message to the author of the article, he will fix it hopefully.
Thanks for answering! I'm guessing then best way would then be to create a class so I can pass it on apply and create a new column, right? So I'd have: players\_return\["return\_win\_per\_rolling\_mean"\] = players\_return.apply(my\_class, axis=1) &amp;#x200B; How would I build this class though? Still very basic here when it comes to OOP
I did the math for mine too, and uh... no comment... lol - when I was younger, I’d see programs written in AppleSoft and QBasic now a new generation is releasing similar content in one of the most ubiquitous languages of this generation.
More like multiprocessing as multithreading won't really work as long as the GIL is around
Luck Good
Gud look
Good luck
Good post! I have been working with an enormous dataset and have a dictionary that has 12 million keys. If I am reading the article right, I should change this dictionary to a bunch of instances of a class. This may slightly decrease the memory usage, but I think it would be a lot slower. Do you have any thoughts on this?
What is it in /r/python with those low-effort articles that present basic stuff acting as if unveiling deepest, most arcane and secret knowledge. Is it just in effort to promote their blogs by any means possible? Does /r/learnpython not allow blogs?
Big thanks for the Instagram-API library. I didn't know that was a thing. At the moment the script uses geckodriver and Selenium. Probably going to stick with them for now since I am very new to Python and need to learn a lot before I do anything with the program. I know the Instagram-API-python probably would make thing simpler, but I really like the idea of the bot of imitating clicks, etc. and hope it comes useful in the future for other programs as well.
How do you enter code in here so that it actually looks like code, with the grayed-out background?
A good programmer never memorizes, we use Google or other means of help. I've been programming for about 15 years now and I still Google things all the time. Over time you will start remembering the simple and basic things but you never need to memorize. No job is going to fire you for looking something up.
Isn't that the site that flags every useful answer for deletion?
You would need to include some type of JavaScript into an E-Mail HTML template with analytics. However this is not allowed because of the security ramifications it imposes. The only way you could handle something like this would be to have access to the actual computer in question.
&gt;This particular creation required a number of additional features in order to function specifically in order to create nudes None of which are so specific that it can't be used for any other set of applications. The only reason Github banned it is because Microsoft feared the backlash it will receive (in terms of sales, stock points etc) so they had to show that they are taking proactive action. They and everyone else knows this kind of strategy is never effective in achieving anything and will only make it worse. You can't control what a particular technology will be used for, you can only make sure that you're using it for a good purpose. If someone can utilize the improvements made in Deep Nude to an application (say enhancing MRI images for different diseases like cancer) that will be a good thing to come out of it. Banning technology based on its usage is just stupid and are the kind of things I expect from people who have no clue about how software, internet or basically how human nature works.
Raw text was new for me. Thanks for this
Not a single mention of backtesting. Odd.
interesting, thanks for the link. i've been using php for my backend for years and i'd love to try something more... modern.

Does it? Serious question. I'm pretty new to all of this, I've only been doing this for a year. It has been very helpful, so I would be curious to know of there are issues with it.
 [https://www.reddit.com/wiki/markdown](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/markdown)
I really, really hate StackOverflow. Their moderation is notorious for being extremely pedantic and flagging helpful Q&amp;A's as duplicates, off topic, or some other reason. I don't hate it as a question solver. I hate it as an answer seeker. I don't post questions or answers on the site, because I was a frequent lurker coming in from Google searches. I literally can't recall a single helpful solution on the site that wasn't flagged for deletion.
.. and really cool **cmd-line** tool is to use [cheat.ch](https://cheat.ch) \-service. For example if you would like to know how to use generators on python you would type: &amp;#x200B; `curl '`[`cheat.sh/python/generators`](https://cheat.sh/python/generators)`'` &amp;#x200B; on your command line. or if you need to know how to convert interger to string in C you would type: &amp;#x200B; `curl '`[`cheat.sh/C/integer`](https://cheat.sh/C/integer)`to string '`
That was my first project too! If you are ever lost i can send you mine to use as a cheat sheet ;)
That was exactly my thoughts!!
You can create DataFrame from that list like this: `df = pd.DataFrame(data=[{"key":"val","key2":"val2"},{"key":"val","key2":"val2"},{"key":"val","key2":"val2"}])` I am not sure how do you need exactly compare this information with other DataFrame, can you explain a bit more or give example data?
I see Maybe we are really on different levels then. I use it a lot for data manipulation for machine learning, especially for pandas, it has been very helpful. But mostly because I'm still learning a lot, so these are questions that have come up probably a million times. It might be only helpful when on a beginner / intermediate level on some libraries, and get less useful after? In what situations didn't you find what you wanted?
THIS. I'm making my own toolbox for functions in different languages and its SOOO helpful
This would be much, much slower
Try timeit library
well from further down in the article, perhaps you could use a `namedtuple` to get even more of a performance boost?
How does one get 12 000 000 keys?
12 million? What are you working on?
Do you suggest to replace the dictionary with an instance of a class with 12 million attributes? Or the values inside the dictionary?
I'd doubt GitHub cares they just don't want it to be associated with them
What about data classes introduced in Python 3.7?
Name of the game
I would try reinstalling pycharm (likely culprit) and python (unlikely but easy to do).
Unless you're actually running low on memory, just stick with dictionaries. 12 million isn't that many keys, and if you run into issues you probably need a database or key-value store.
You should see my atomistic simulation analysis ;-)
\&gt; The object size in RAM has become significantly smaller Is this an error? The class is shown as using 56 bytes while slots class is shown as using 64 bytes.
\&gt; non-mutilated objects love this translation lol
been a while since I did any web scraping but if you're using beautiful soup isn't it something like `soup.findAll(attrs={'class':None})` ?
A careless Enter gave me 1,000,000 copies of a 2048x1024 image the other day. Surprisingly, the """memory leak""" killed Chrome instead of Python.
haha just did a Celsius-to-Fahrenheit calculator in like 4 lines of code!
If this is the case he can use AutoIT to automate the process.
on some phones there are emergency contacts that u can access without unlocking
Thanks for checking it out! Yeah, raw strings are super helpful for escape characters.
Thank you!
 @property def _get_y(self): return self[1] @property def _get_y(self): return self[2] Good post. Just a quick correction, in the tuple example need switch the third property to \`\_get\_z\`
Multilevel modeling is a big one. As far as I can tell, there isn't a "standard" package that can estimate multilevel models with arbitrary crossed random effects and partially-crossed effects. Item Response Theory models are also a big one in my line of work. We use specialized software for some of it, but it helps that R has a standard package that we can use.
Great, now go and try to make a binary to decimal calculator. It's not too hard but you have to look some things up. Look on google how to convert from binary to decimal and try to code it. It's good because if you don't know much about decimal, you will learn a bit. If you can do it, it is also a good problem because you can escalate it: first you make it binary to decimal then you make it decimal to binary then you make it work for any number base then you can make a graphical interface then you can try and put this interface on a website. It is a big challenge, it took me a long time because I was a beginner when I did it (I was 21 so for you might be an even bigger challenge). I also did it in Java, but python might be a lot better for this problem.
Surely the owner will try to phone it sooner or later. Make sure to keep it charged.
also, post here the code so we can review it mate ;)
12 million keys is an inordinately high amount of attributes for something like a namedtuple.
not sure on the question, you may be able to use a combination of str.isnumeric() and or character itteration to get the desired result? Will need more info on what you're trying to achieve to help though
 def startMenu(): print(' 1. Enter World\n 2. Create new character\n 3. Exit') mainMenu = int(input()) if mainMenu == 1: enterWorld() elif mainMenu == 2: newCharacter() elif mainMenu == 3: print('Goodbye!') else: startMenu()
looking to have the else: run based on any input other than the first 3 elif statements
\`\`\` In \[1\]: from dataclasses import dataclass In \[2\]: @dataclass ...: class Test: ...: x: int ...: y: int ...: z: int ...: In \[3\]: t = Test(1, 2, 3) In \[4\]: import sys In \[5\]: print(sys.getsizeof(t), sys.getsizeof(t.\_\_dict\_\_)) 56 112 \`\`\`
you could either add another level above that which splits it out to numeric/str values a bit further mainMenu = input("") if mainMenu.isnumeric(): if int(mainMenu) == 1: enterWorld() ....... else: startMenu()
it's cleared out the indentation, but you get the idea.
It has 10% battery, I’m gutted that they didn’t start the message with the number I suspect they weren’t sure how much text appears in the preview. If they have text it we are hoping they ring it! Not sure we have a compatible charger as it’s an huwawei
 def startMenu(): print(' 1. Enter World\n 2. Create new character\n 3. Exit') mainMenu = input('') if mainMenu == '1': enterWorld() elif mainMenu == '2': newCharacter() elif mainMenu == '3': print('Goodbye!') else: startMenu()
this worked
That's a much simpler approach!
Bioinformatics genome wide analyses. The shear amount of data to work with makes the job fun!
yeah apparently &amp;#x200B; input('') is better than input() when you need to take the input as either an integer or string
Do this def startMenu(): print(' 1. Enter World\n 2. Create new character\n 3. Exit') try: mainMenu = int(input()) except ValueError as error: startMenu() else: if mainMenu == 1: enterWorld() elif mainMenu == 2: newCharacter() elif mainMenu == 3: print('Goodbye!') If the the user doesn't enter a number an exception will be raised. We catch that exception and prompt the user to try again. If there is no error the else runs using the value they entered.
&gt;the """memory leak""" We have docstrings for memory leaks now? What a time to be alive!
well yea, i can't really fathom the need for that anyway. an in-memory object (regardless of what it is) seems like the wrong solution for that much data
That’s exactly what I was thinking. As with everything, it’s a tradeoff.
Huwawei should be Micro USB, unless very new and then possibly USB C. Most should be Micro, though.
ooooo interesting, so I can create nested if/elif statements using else, that's cool &amp;#x200B; also try: I need to read up on that one and value error
I once saw a docstring documenting a memory leak on a function that someone at work tried to optimize with Cython. The compiler had messed up free, so the function would malloc a piece of memory and never release it. Instead of fixing that, they simply slapped a "use sparingly as it leaks memory" warning on the docstring.
No, the article is comparing a large number of small dictionaries (3 entries), to a large number of small object instances (3 attributes). Python knows how to do some memory sharing in the objects case because the dictionary keys (the attribute names), can usually be shared among all instance dictionaries (PEP 412). It doesn't apply to the situation of a single large dictionary. Generally the overhead of all the memory for all the stored objects will greatly exceed the memory overhead of the dictionary; so don't worry about it, you have bigger fish to fry.
&gt;Instead of fixing that, they simply slapped a "use sparingly as it leaks memory" warning on the docstring. Somehow, they managed to discover the coding-equivalent of those warnings on cigarette cartons
ahhhhhhhhh ok while mainMenu = False elif elif elif

Explain please
Thank you for this information
Sadly they haven’t set it up
A normal class has size 56 + the size of ```__dict__```, which in this case is 112, making the total class size 167 bytes. The slots class does not have ```__dict__``` making the total size 64. ```python In [3]: t = Test(1, 2, 3) In [4]: import sys In [5]: print(sys.getsizeof(t), sys.getsizeof(t.__dict__)) 56 112 In [6]: class Test2: ...: __slots__ = 'x', 'y', 'z' ...: def __init__(self, x, y, z): ...: self.x = x ...: self.y = y ...: self.z = z ...: In [7]: t2 = Test2(1, 2, 3) In [8]: print(sys.getsizeof(t2), sys.getsizeof(t2.__dict__)) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- AttributeError Traceback (most recent call last) &lt;ipython-input-8-8510dfdf4853&gt; in &lt;module&gt; ----&gt; 1 print(sys.getsizeof(t2), sys.getsizeof(t2.__dict__)) AttributeError: 'Test2' object has no attribute '__dict__' In [9]: print(sys.getsizeof(t2)) 64 ```
You can still see the overall pattern in the image, despite the fact that you've encrypted each pixel's value with what's supposedly a secure key.
How would I get around this
Bots that can read websites and click on things is a very advanced project. I have a CS degree and never did anything that hard.
&gt;Who cares about cheat sheets when you have the interpreter? &amp;#x200B; You're talking about figuring out what's happening through a REPL, right? Either way, toss out the standard REPL in favor of ipython, ptpython, or - am I missing something good?
Thirdedededed this. Making your own cheat sheet is a very effective tool to memorize them. (Flashcards can also be handy -- I've recently created a new set for all the fancy statistical acronyms that I'd otherwise never be able to remember.)
Actually, yeah. A lot of the time, reading the implementation of some maths, with a canonical, well-documented API (e.g. numpy), is much easier than trying to parse the godawful mess which is mathematical and algorithmic notation.
https://i.imgur.com/wyKgW7C.png This past week, I have been working on a Google Drive file renamer. It uses Python\Flask and the Google Drive API. You can rename your files using regex. I implemented batch requests where you can send up to 100 API calls in 1 request which helps for faster renaming. I've tested it on a thousand files and it works pretty good. Now I'm just figuring out other features I can add or rewriting pieces of the code make it better. You working on anything?
I live near there! I have my phone though
Working on a Google Drive File Renamer. https://i.imgur.com/wyKgW7C.png One of my first Flask projects. Pretty much works good now, just thinking of other features to add.

Have you tried to download more RAM?
Please pop the SIM card and pop it in your phone and give a call to your friends number. Once you know the number you can contact the owner.
Selenium is a good library for that. It checks the HTML elements and imitates clicks and other stuff. [https://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/](https://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/)

Sure, Python interpreter can have a beautiful interface. I use SublimeREPL and Cmder. And of course, IPython/Jupyter Notebook is great, too.
How long does it take to run your script? Why does it need to run on the second server?
Nice beach
Oh man how did I not realize that😂 Thanks for the insight!
The script on the second server takes around 20 minutes. As for running on the second server, there is spcific app that runs there and the script on that server automates a task for it. But in the grand scheme that automated task is small part of an overall process that needs to be done on that particular server.
ahhhh, I see now. Thanks!
Where can I download the pygame package? That runs with 2.7 python.
And you need to return the value _where_? To the same HTTP request that started it? HTTP isn't really designed for that.
I had issues there too, eventually I just hardcoded in a resolution. I might work on adding an input to let the user control the resolution after running the script. You can try messing around with the image processing code to forgo/change the resizing step. Or you can try changing the distance the turtle moves from 10 to a smaller number.
Yep this was my first time working with graphics in Python as well. Really taught me a lot!
Dont run such bot with an account you dont want to lose. Going around the api might get your account banned.
Great suggestion, we are heading to a local phone shop to put the SIM card in one of their phones. At least that way we can leave the phone with them as we are only on holiday in the area and not here for much longer
&gt; Once you know the number you can contact the owner. It's a good way to retrieve the number, but other than finding the carrier with it, how would you contact the owner?
Yeah pretty much, I'm new enough to this and couldn't find much on this spcific question online.
It’s on purpose. It’s controlled by the Turtle refresh rate that I hardcoded a value for, along with the speed of the pen of which I also specified a value.
thank you =)
That's definitely a bad idea. HTTP requests shouldn't take 20 minutes.
I was thinking of having the script on the second server output a 'task complete' file when done and use robocopy to move it to first server and use that as an indicator to carry on with the overall process
reddit doesn't support the triple backticks, you gotta do the four leading spaces per line thing
Could it be worth serializing some of that to disk and only working with subsets one at a time? That seems like an obscene amount of keys.
Hey, that remind me of an excercise in highschool! Here's how I resolved it: Basically, each time you launch the code, it generate a list with every int from 0 to 255 in a random order. The code look at each pixel, and if for exemple the red value of said pixel is 55, then the code will look at the 56th value in the list and make it the new red value. You can use the same list to decrypt the image afterward. If you want extra security, you can encrypt the list, since encrypting a bunch of integers is easier than encrypting an image!
Thats one of the only times I've had an answer from a coding related post which I can understand thank you. Did that completely jumble up the RGB values or does it still have some resemblence like mine
What's slowing it down? I found conda on linux to be more of a pain.
Tbh I found this to be the most effective. Let's me focus more on problem solving and system knowledge. I dont need to remember the semantics of the utility -- theres documentation and Google for that.
Looks great! I would be interested to see source code.
For memory?
Try heroku
Maybe have that in a Redis?
Generators, generators here and there, they're everywhere! Lol in all seriousness, they really do help with memory efficiency.
twitch chat is just an IRC front end, so try expanding your search to any IRC bot. then just point the bot towards the twitch channel's IRC server and you're in business.
Well, it's great if it helps you. I stopped going to that site in 2012-2014-ish, so maybe it's better now. I don't know.
Hoping they have SIM contacts, or at least one contact which we can phone to tell them where the phone/we will be
I’d look into using integer keys if you’re not and using numpy. Python objects have crazy overhead. A 32 bit integer is 4 bytes; add 4 for a pointer and 12M*4 bytes for that array. The same sized python int has a pointer and a value, so 8 bytes and 12M*8. Nested dictionaries are the worst.

I have a set of 1.5 billion data points that wouldn't quite fit in ram. I ended up importing the whole thing into Postgres and running queries against it. With some good indexes and smart caching it's really comfy to work with.
Do you know the fix? My guess is they couldn’t solve it, but a doc change is easy.
Does this really look like the subreddit for this to you?
prob ur best bet is to use sockets. have ur web app connect to ur python script and wait for ur return value. pseudo code: import socket s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) s.connect(("IP_ADDRESS", PORT)) s.send(b"YOUR COMMAND") output = s.recv(1024) with this ur first python script would connect to the server ur secondary python script is listening on and u can handle the data requests this would require learning about sockets and networking which is pretty simple in python.
If you have an intel CPU, np fft backed by MKL will be 30-40% faster than FFTW. If you have an nvidia GPU, use cupy for GPU ffts.
Nice to see a good human once in a while. Good work.
I’d just kick off multiple jobs. System calls have the least overhead.
A little, but not much. Where do you store your Arial font on Windows vs Linux? That’s the sort of stuff you need to worry about.

Maybe they have the find my device service enabled?
Thanks for the reply, I'll look into sockets and networking so.
np! if u need any help feel free to dm me!, cheers.
For reference, only "New" Reddit supports triple backtick. "Old" Reddit is stuck with quadruple spaces, as well as most Mobile clients.
Well if you are on windows type in the cmd Pip install PyGame But I’m not even sure if that supports Python 2.7 Python 3 should be the best
New Reddit redesign supports both, but mobile apps don't often support it.
At least we've restricted the suspects list
Use the Anaconda python distribution instead, it comes with numpy, spicy, pandas &amp; and a slew of other libraries. That should get you up and running.
Just in case the owner sees these comments, we have left the phone with the EE shop on the retail park in Alnwick. The store assistant David is posting on the local Facebook pages so I’m really hoping this can be returned to the owner
Oh okay thank you! I will look into the details of it!
If you're familiar with discrete numbers and algorithms then those operators will empower you to write extremely efficient algorithms that operate purely on the binary data that underlies the algorithm. For instance you can perform nearest neighbor searching and indexing of a quad tree using bytes and pure bitwise operands.
Sounds like a job for batching. Also, if someone already hasn't suggested it, use Pandas. Also, if your data set is huge (12 mil key/value pairs? or 12 mil rows?), consider looking into Spark or something like it
I wouldn't call 'xor encryption' a secure key.
mods pin this post for a while
I maintain a list of python functions and codes on a google collab
thanks, corrected!
A one time pad is perfectly secure, assuming it's used correctly.
I believe you're correct that 895 is the problem. `re.sub()` replaces all instances of the pattern in the statement, so that on the next line, no more tokens are left to find in the `re.search()` and the while loop exits.
Ohhhh! So I need to use the count and surround it with a while loop. Thank you!

I’m wondering, does `pyinstaller` work and make *.exe files for Windows if used on Linux?
To be honest, because the application relies heavily on scraping new/recent data, it's very tough to backtest it. Open to suggestions though. Hence, my aim to collaborate.
I suggest you do some programming challenges (simple and easy ones) read Python official documentation, stackoverflow and note down useful functions and modules creating your own cheat sheet. It's impossible to remember what all the functions do in Python because there are so many, and it's pointless anyway. You can always use something like PyCharm, or Jedi to autocomplete, Even `help` function can teach you a lot. But if you are just starting use a text editor so you can get familiar with the functions. Another way to learn is posting completed and fully working solutions to codereview.stackexchange.com for review. Exercism site also have mentoring for free.
I had a similar issue recently that was due to our firewall. This was my solution: **Problem**: trying to install modules/libraries via command line or PyCharm, I got the error “Could not fetch URL [https://pypi.python.org/simple/pyodbc/](https://pypi.python.org/simple/pyodbc/): There was a problem confirming the ssl certificate: \[SSL: CERTIFICATE\_VERIFY\_FAILED\] certificate verify failed (\_ssl.c:661) - skipping” I *really* didn’t want to ask IT to install every module I might need, so I found this solution. &amp;#x200B; **Solution**: Create python config file Create the file C:\\Users\\&lt;you&gt;\\AppData\\Roaming\\pip\\pip.ini Paste the following contents: \[global\] trusted-host = pypi.python.org pypi.org files.pythonhosted.org Save/close Module/library installation should work now
He's not using a one time pad he's xoring each byte with the same value.
Another way of making the image less obvious is using the output of the pixel to generate new keys as it goes. You can also play with bit rotation to avoid the xor undoing itself. I wouldn't call this ciphering, but it's fun. Carrying to generate new keys as it goes is what is used to remove visible patterns from the result.
thanks again for the suggestions. Another quick question, will i be able to deploy the flask template on an already existing website. Say, if have developing access to a website which is being run on JavaScript, and now i want to add a button which would run the python scripts. Can flask or django do that? I am asking because when i started with trying and running the server at the website's server IP it gives an error saying "invalid port."

You could scrape historical news. After all they don’t delete the stories from WSJ or wherever you are scraping. I have played around with Q learning and other methods but getting the sentiment “score” if you will is difficult. A guy out of Stanford opened sourced a NLP that had sentiment scoring, I haven’t invested any time in it but it may be a way to get up and running on a shorter timeline.
Numpy etc isn't just some Python code - it's C, Fortran etc.. You should probably go with anaconda that way you'll have pretty much everything
&gt; Python doesn't have arrays as part of the standard library. Sorry but this is false. Python has typed arrays https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html which are useful when you need to store big chunks of memory and you don't need the full power of ndarry from NumPy.
Obligatory [https://xkcd.com/927/](https://xkcd.com/927/)
Use [Conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda). Your co-workers are sadly mistaken. Conda will manage all the version dependencies of as many virtual environments as you like. It will also manage version dependencies of binary packages, like the MKL linear algebra package for Numpy/Scipy, etc. Don't build anything yourself. Just download Conda and use 'conda install'. Everything is installed privately and doesn't interfere with system provided python or libraries.
If it doesn't work, call your own phone with the Sim card. Check the number, and Google it.

Progress is slow - I fix one problem only to be immediately hit by the next one.
Also, I meant that on Linux I don't use conda at all, just pip. Much easier.
Never tried it but I don't see why it wouldn't. Try it see if it works.
why would you think the timeit library would help with memory in a question about something being slower?
It's called searching documentation online ;-) this way you'll become familiar to it and won't be "limited" by your cheat sheet
Well it's using this library to post to instagram: https://github.com/LevPasha/Instagram-API-python From looking at one of the example it accepts your username and password which replace the YOUR_INFO strings. https://github.com/LevPasha/Instagram-API-python/blob/master/examples/upload_photo.py For the reddit part it is using PRAW which requires you to register an appliation on your reddit account. https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/authentication.html https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/ When you do so you will get a client_id and client_secret which replace the YOUR_INFO strings.
Well thank you, usually people think my explenations are confusing! From what I remember the pic was completely unrecognisable.
I will. I’ll edit this comment later today to see if it does.
Those are not the same thing, and you rarely need to hardcode this much data. Stop trying to write Lisp in Python.
So, this has to be something in my code. I re-installed Python, and PyCharm with the same results. I then ran the project from Idle, with the same results. What could I have possibly done to my code to warrant this behavior? I am using PyQt5 to create a GUI, and Pandas to interact with Excel data. My project currently has 4 different files.
It works completely different from Deepfake. Deepfake is doing face-swap, i.e. you take porn and put somebodies face in it. It needs boatloads of training data to understand how to transform one face into the other. Deepnude is doing pix2pix in-painting, i.e. take picture and draw boobs on it, it doesn't need training on the users side, since it isn't translating the pixel data, it just draws some boobs in the area. It also doesn't do video, just single images. The [README (mirror)](https://github.com/stacklikemind/deepnude_official) contains some picture example of what is going on under the hood.
you could set up your flask or Django app as a web service , so your existing JavaScript website could do an Ajax request to your python app and receive the response. Another alternative could be using AWS lambda functions with API gateway , and you wouldn’t need a server ( you can also package flask apps as lambda functions using something like Zappa, but what it is doing is the background is mainly the same thing, i.e: AWA lambda+API gateway )
you missed the point of the rhetorical question
Hey /u/ProfessorKeenBean Adrian Rosebrock from [PyImageSearch.com](https://PyImageSearch.com). I offer over 300+ free tutorials on the [PyImageSearch.com](https://PyImageSearch.com). Use them, learn from them, ask me questions, I'm happy to help. My paid books and courses help support the blog. They enable me to continue offering free help and tutorials. Posts like this really discourage me from helping others, and to be honest, really bums me out, as instead of coming to me to ask for help, you turned to reddit to ask for a free copy. That really stings. Anyway, if you ever want to reach out, you know my email address or can contact me: [https://www.pyimagesearch.com/contact/](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/contact/)
When I've to deal with large numpy arrays, I simply use sparse matrices.

I think by now most are usb c since p9 is already usb c.
I stand corrected.
Yeah I've thought about that. I guess once I have a historical database, I would just run the algo at set time intervals, in the past to see what it would've done, and then measure the performance. Just tough building all of this as a one man shop.
There are plenty of libraries in python that make sentiment analysis fairly easy. Just takes some tweaking to catch weird things like sarcasm or false signals.
Great attitude! Be the change you want to see in the world. Cliché quote but validly positive.
And here I am, writing a language with 32 bytes (4 words) of overhead and wondering if it's too much ...
If it is simple stuff you could probably use Google Colab (basically Jupyter Notebook) and share it with them.
Off topic, but is anyone else seeing this in the r/Python subreddit? It doesn't seem like it belongs here?? Am I just crazy?
Did you even read the post?
OP mentions the users phone had a notification from this subreddit. So it's likely the owner frequents this sub, and therefore might see this post.

incorrect, we have yet to establish how many phones circle42 owns for our find owner function to work without error
You probably shouldn't have 12 million keys. At this point memory becomes a factor and it makes more sense to arrange the data in an ordered index or binary search tree index instead. Or if the keys are just used instead of object attributes, then definitely at least convert it to an object.
Using selenium is slow, advanced. instead going with API as someone suggest is the best idea. I'm doing a mini script using reddit API and never once considered using selenium. Selenium is good for small websites. Tldr; Use API if available or 3rd party ones, of they don't fit can't do your job then try your own.
Why isn't this being moderated!!!!
Done this while learning front end web dev. Quite useful. Started learning python recently and thinking of doing the same, with adding my own functions folder for re-use.
What is preventing you from using something like Redis to store these values? Do you want all of them at the same time? or is it just a lookup table?
is cupy recommendable?
Because of the code content as it is right now, all I needed to do was add `count=1` and the it was set. I really appreciate you looking at my code.
overapi.com is a good collection of cheat sheets
Huh? The topic is about memory usage, not speed. They're often at odds. I can easily estimate the memory usage of my program very accurately with a few basic multiplications. I can also calculate very easily how it will grow with N vs. M. That number will be accurate for other computers. I'm not very close to my estimate, I can ask what I'm doing wrong and easily find what's taking up extra memory. For speed, you cannot really do that, so you cheat and time a representative problem. You're not going to count FLOPs. Then you look for ways to speed it up, but there is no "optimal" answer.
 I finally finished my second big(ish) project and Im glad I finally finished. Its called Pylette and is a palette creator which can create palettes from images. I created it because it wasn't a fun experience to pick colors one by one and typing the values into a pixel editor to get a palette from said picture. I was especially bad for pictures with few colors which couldn't be imported because they had to many imperceivable colors because of compression. So I made this program to help me out, but it took longer than doing it by hand over a hundred times so I hope that you guys enjoy it and use it so that there is at least some return in investment. So any feedback would be appreciated and would like to know if you think it is good enough to share it other places which don't have anything to do with programming.

How can you contact the owner when you have their phone and SIM?
thank you!
Visit the nearest carrier store and inform them.
You're writing Lisp in Python. Don't do that. It's not good. Ah fuck, who am I kidding. It's just not worth trying any more, is it?
 [https://www.tweepy.org/](https://www.tweepy.org/)
It takes 12,000,000 keys to describe an individual atom?
Good to know. I will probably make another bot after finishing this with the API and see how it works compared to this one.
Well, of course we used traits. But we never saw a need to extend Indexable or Iterable. Having an extensible library of higher kind behaviors is there to encourage you to write your own custom ones, and instead develop complex behavior by composing functionality rather than inheritance. I never saw anything that couldn't be handled by one of the existing collection implementations, so you'd just boil your business logic down to a explicit series of operations on a collection. But in python, it seems to prefer inheritance over composition? By implementing your own classes that override special methods and treating them like existing data structures, it kind of feels like that's encouraged.
Why don't you use something simpler like: &amp;#x200B; `import re` &amp;#x200B; `search = re.compile(r'.*(orig|orgi).*(\d\d\d\d\d)', re.IGNORECASE)` `""" Your list goes here """` `for i in for i in listVals:` `print(search.findall(i))` `[('Orig', '06889')]` `[('Orig', '05815')]` `[('Orig', '06039')]` `...` `[('Orig', '35346')]` `[]` `[('Orig', '04314')]` `[('Orig', '04314')]` `[]` `...`
Pretty though.
Thank you!

i am also new to Python :) it's fun honestly.
&gt; But in python, it seems to prefer inheritance over composition? You don't have to inherit from any particular base class to implement the special methods (in Python 3; in Python 2 you have to explicitly inherit `object` somewhere in your hierarchy to enable them). So if you want an iterable and indexable class, just write a class that implements `__iter__()` and `__getitem__()`. It doesn't have to inherit from `list` or any other special base class to do so. &gt; By implementing your own classes that override special methods and treating them like existing data structures, it kind of feels like that's encouraged. Again the issue is you're thinking that "implements `__iter__()` and `__getitem__()` means it's a list", rather than "means it's iterable and indexable". Idiomatic Python code shouldn't ever care whether a given iterable/indexable thing is actually an instance of `list` (or a subclass of `list`, etc.); it just cares about whether the thing is iterable and indexable. Stop thinking of it as "make this behave like that other data structure" and start thinking of it as "make this *be* a data structure".
Or you can just create it with Endtest.
Good to know, thank you
How, without the PIN code ?

Check out /r/learnpython
Personally I'd do keywords = """a number of keywords across several lines or many lines as a long string""".split() If you really want to do something like your last example you need \ at the end to escape the newline: string = "a number of keywords" + \ "across several lines or many lines" + \ "as a long string" print(string.split()) Also word of advice. I would advice against overwritting built-ins. If you do write "str=..." and then later in your code have for instance pring("something" + str(3)) you'll get an error that you are trying to call a str as a function because now str is no longer the builtin function but the string you assigned to the name.
For practice you can look up common exercises, there are tons of “already been done” projects for you to do yourself and gain the experience. I have this dilemma sometimes. My best projects usually fulfill some type of need. So, I need to first have a problem to solve before I’m able to create a solution.
It does not.

Immutable objects cannot be mutilated, only deleted.
What's the question?
I don't know where to start :/ any resource recommendations?
Not sure if I'm missing a joke or if you're trying to help. I just mean that I've always heard and used "mutated" rather than "mutilated". In English, the word, mutilate connotes violence, while mutate is just a simple operation that changes state.
Once you've clarified what you want to do then /r/learnpython is probably the place for you. It sounds like you don't quite understand the business logic behind the solution to your question. Python can't tell you what that is. Sort your business logic out then codify the rules then build it in python.
More the former. Immutable objects are immune to mutilation, by virtue of their utter refusal to change state.
I have the exact same issue at work. I found two workarounds: 1. Go to https://pypi.org/ search for the module, download the right wheel and install it via pip. 2. Open a hotspot with your smartphone, connect with your computer, install via pip
Try to relate it to something that you do on a regular basis and be curious with the mindset of ‘hmmm....what if I do this?” For example, if you check twitter on a daily basis, what if you mine Twitter data? If you are a fan of exercise, what if you creat a program that you can use to track something?
on your smartphone you can get the sololearn app for learning python. it's pretty good. you can download the python interpreter as a standalone not requiring installation or admin rights. yes, the tutorial at python.org is a good place to start learning the syntax and basic stuff.
In practice, is there a difference between inheriting from an interface, and just implementing all the special methods between make up that interface? Seems to me that it's pretty much functionally identical in python, unless you're doing explicit isinstance checks on something. I do recognize the flexibility in python's approach, I'm more talking about how "pythonic" stresses behavior that *feels* like the behavior you get from OO inheritance. Also in chapter 3, the book's examples encourage building your custom dicts by inheriting from dict and userdict, so I'm guessing it's pythonic to do plenty of direct inheritance as well? While I wasn't initially thinking of "implements __iter__() and __getitem__() means it's a list", this got me thinking, isn't that basically what duck typing is about? For example, the update method on dict checks if the first argument has the keys methods or not, and if it does, it assumes that it's a mapping, otherwise it assumes they're key-val tuples. Is that not pythonic? Given the large number of polymorphic arguments supported by functions (functions that take x, where x could a variety of different types and behaviors), it seems like the standard library is taking a lot of shortcuts/assumptions to figure out what is what, including "if x has method g, it's y". I do get your point about approaching things to "be a data structure", I'm more talking how in my previous approaches, I never wanted to create any custom things that were "iterable and indexable". I'm trying to figure out what's the "pythonic" criterion for saying, hey, this usecase should itself be "iterable and indexable" over using an existing data structure.
By me, certainly. It is by far the most superior GPGPU library in python as long as you’re on team green.
1. **I heard that python.org the actual site has the best beginner tutorial / guide. Is that true ?** This is subjective. In my opinion, I find the official documentation to be superb. The tutorial provides brief examples of how to implement data structures, functions, classes, and some of the common modules. It is by no means comprehensive, but it is a great start to familiarize yourself with the language. 2. **Also is it possible for me to learn from my smartphone and maybe input code as well ?** Yes. I have an iPhone, so I am not sure as to what IDEs are available on Android; but if you are an iPhone user, I highly recommend [Pythonista 3](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/), an IDE developed by omz. It is a pretty thorough IDE with many modules already pre-installed and there are methods which allow for the installation of other modules via pip. You can develop fully-working applications on this. I have even used it to solve a few programming challenges on *HackThisSite*.
/r/learnpython
Look into data scraping libraries: requests, beautifulsoup, selenium.
Can you add SimpleNamespace to this analysis?
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar. &gt; is it possible for me to learn from my smartphone and maybe input code as well Yes, but the methods to do it are pretty terrible. Pythonista is a passable option.
