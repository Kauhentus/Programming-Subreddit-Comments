I don't see any sabotaging. The complaint is common and pointless until python 3.7. Then if we want to discuss about yaml as a format... don't get me started.
It is simple, you don't need any library : L_iter = L.__iter__() [[a] + [i for b, i in zip(range(n - 1), L_iter)] for a in L_iter] j/k don't do that (this code works tho), I would suggest you do do a simple batching function def batch(iterable, size): counter = 0 current_batch = [] for element in iterable: current_batch.append(element) counter +=1 if counter % n == 0: yield current_batch current_batch = [] yield current_batch
Only if it was possible to make an ascii one so that it could be used in the terminal
```python class Counter(): def __init__(self, count): """Creates a counter starting at 0" self.count = 0 def count1(): self.count += 1 print(self.count) counter = Counter() counter.count() counter.count() counter.count()``` That should do the job? 
never seen one, but it's highly dependent on the number of transactions. Python is not that good with multithreading and overal speed of code execution isn't that great either 
It would really help if you copied and pasted the error you are getting, instead of expecting other people to run your code and see for themselves. py&gt; counter() Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 4, in counter UnboundLocalError: local variable 'count' referenced before assignment Inside the `counter` nested function, you need to declare count as a nonlocal: nonlocal count This is Python 3 only, in Python 2 you can't do this directly.
I suggest finding a mentor, someone experienced you can talk to when you find things difficult to understand. Online courses are fine, but it's good to know live person able to answer questions, even stupid ones.

I suggest `pathlib.Path.glob`. Do not use any other ways since discover this method.
Interesting think, you can go to the jail for this comment but I'm not) 
try to read about classes what you are trying to do is related to classes. try to watch this playlist [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTsqhIuOqKhwlXsIBIdSeYtc](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTsqhIuOqKhwlXsIBIdSeYtc)
If you're using Python 3 you need to try "nonlocal" here is one example: [https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#why-am-i-getting-an-unboundlocalerror-when-the-variable-has-a-value](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#why-am-i-getting-an-unboundlocalerror-when-the-variable-has-a-value) &amp;#x200B; def createCounter(): count = 0 def counter(): nonlocal count count += 1 return count return counter if you make "count" nonlocal Python finds parent and automatically creates a closure for it. &amp;#x200B;
 s = 'my string' b = b'is a mess' s + b # this raises the error you're experiencing. To make it word you either need to encode s as byte or decode b to a string. s = str.encode(s) s + b #This works and gives you a bytes object. You will need to decode this to a string if you want to make use of it as a string object b = b.decode() s + b #This works and gives you a string object. You will need to encode this as a bytes object if you want to make use of it as a bytes object. Just make sure you take note of encodings and make adjustments as and if necessary. 
find out more here about string to byte: [https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-bytearray](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-bytearray) &amp;#x200B; for example: pad(b'bla bla') wont work because of the error you already know :) try this: pad('bla bla') # without b &amp;#x200B;
Thanks a lot for your reply, actually i think i will try to do this , but i also wanted to know how to implement a standard way of implementation.
Thanks sure i will read this.
Now the same thing in 3d?
not possible with this program, but of course with matplotlib.

Hey /u/AlphaPrime90, totally depends on your use case. HoloViews is a really compelling package, but is definitely focused more on exploration/analysis. If you want to go straight to that step HoloViews is probably the right choice. If you are more interested in getting into the nitty gritty visualization building, Bokeh or any of the many popular plotting libraries may be better. 
Some things are really surprising: * ClojureScript and Rust being ranked fairly low levels, despite being JS and WASM friendly AFAIK. * `npm` ranks at the bottom. Python packaging is better in comparison, and `pip` is still the go-to package manager. * jQuery is still alive and kicking. * people use PyCharm to edit JS? Why?
It looks like you are importing the non-Ananconda version of Pandas. The anaconda versions usually have either "anaconda" or "continuum" (or both) in the path. Make sure you are actually running the Anaconda executable. How do you know what version? import sys print(sys.executable) &amp;#x200B; You might need to configure Spyder to use Anaconda rather than the version shown in your output. 
matplotlib has an Animation module that can make 3d animations. In this program all things happend on the square grid and the animations are directly encoded as binary data and finally written to gif. It would be too tedious to implement line drawing algorithms on gif canvas.
Thank you. I was concerned because the end of support for (bkcharts) and (bokeh.charts). So I wanted to make the transition. Do you think bokeh is going to remain supported?
Start with a dictionary of the words and their corresponding abbreviation.
Your first sentence isn't very fair. There are plenty of programmers who have used Python since versions &lt; 1.0 that would choose not to use type annotations.
PyCharm ships with full features of WebStorm (IntelliJ's web dev IDE)

I signed up! I'll be starting tonight. You can private message me today and we can work on it together. I work full time so I won't be working on this until the evenings EST. We could also do reddit instant chat but I won't see those if I'm at work because Relay for reddit doesn't have chat built in yet. 
I see! Good to know.
&gt; Do-Repeat-Yourself concept. For example, each validator starts with the following code And this is why I believe Python should have macros. Good to note on the function call slowdown. On the security perspective, I wasn't claiming that you're a malicious actor-- just that it seems to be easy to make large blunders that go undetected for years.
Is Hilbert your hammer? Haha. I think a simple for loop would suffice to walk the rgb space :)
1. /r/learnpython 2. A better way here would be to use for word in lines: print(word) time.sleep(0.3)
I'll check tomorrow. Thanks. 
&gt; I think a simple for loop would suffice to walk the rgb space for r in range(0, 256): for g in range(0, 256): for b in range(0, 256): pass Not really, since the transition from 255 to 0 is always a hard transition so it wouldn't be good, but you could do 0to255 and 254to1 in turns, so range(0, 256) and then range(254, 0, -1). To avoid awful nesting, you could do backandforth = list(range(0, 256)) + list(range(254, 0, -1)) for r in backandforth: for g in backandforth: for b in backandforth: pass
Use HSV instead. Keep S and V the same and take H from 0 to 255 (or 360, or 1.0, or whatever ) and then convert your HSV colour to RGB for rendering. Another way is: Start with RGB(255,0,0) Gradually increase G until 255,255,0 Gradually reduce R until 0,255,0 Gradually increase B until 0,255,255 Gradually reduce G until 0,0,255 Gradually increase R until 255,0,255 Gradually reduce blue until 255,0,0 And you’re back to the start. 
&gt; py&gt; What's that `py` prompt? I usually get a &gt;&gt;&gt; in my python interpreter?
Awesome!! I will PM you. 
In my free time I'll continue to work on \[Valve's Artifact API wrapper\]([https://github.com/iscre4m/pyartifact](https://github.com/iscre4m/pyartifact)). Every little bit of practice designing library API is great, especially when there's a potential to have users :) I might also write a post about releasing a library from scratch with everything then (2 years ago) and now - how new tools and their integration with other tools advanced and how many of them aren't able to keep up with the advancements in python ecosystem.

Not yet using type annotations: understandable. Creating your own weird class hierarchies to emulate type annotations but in a half-assed way that mypy won’t help much with: not as understandable. An experienced Python programmer would use a bare list, not one wrapped inside another class name just for finales.
That gamecube intro sound with the purple squares was all I heard while watching this lol
Oh God I know that feeling. it's actually a quite nice feeling when you learn something new and can apply to so many different things even if it is overkill potentially.
This is a valid solution to accomplish the same task, unless your task is to use closures on your programming homework. 
Why do I feel like this was a homework question?
you mean JSON validator right? I did not see it anywhere
Guys.... Guys... He is calling count() and not counter()
Sorry about that, I'm still in the learning phase myself so instead of the insults would you mind explaining how you would do this correctly as I believe this method achieves the same outcome?
puppeteer uses the google chromium driver, there are techniques to determine it but there also techniques to work around: e.g. [https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth) basically this gif/example show only wild clickery and loading of the images etc, it would be much more trustworthy if he had shown the success result from google afterwards, this leads to the question why he actually did not :| &amp;#x200B;
1 &amp; 2 are definitely an annoyance when it comes to using Python-only code, however I would argue there is a benefit to doing it this way The value is that you can use the library with different programming languages far more easily. For example, in college I had a class on compilers where each assignment took input and produced output as text from `stdin` and `stdout`. So then between assignments(!), we could switch programming languages without needing to struggle with things like [FFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface) or serialization.
**Foreign function interface** A foreign function interface (FFI) is a mechanism by which a program written in one programming language can call routines or make use of services written in another. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Although the title refers to the JS aspect, I wrote the conversion scripts in Python, and also took the chance to use Black to reformat our Python source as well. Conversion scripts are linked from the article.
I haven’t gotten any indication that it won’t be. They just released a huge update in version 1.0 last month and quickly followed it up with a dot release so it seems like they are still actively maintaining it.

Thanks. Bookmarked your guide for future reference.
$50? LOL. If they arent real people, they arent followers.
For hobbies and open source projects, it might make sense to see more ClojureScript and Rust, but companies are VERY slow to use new languages. Python has been with us since the 80s, so it having momentum still speaks loudly to mangers. The same concept is true for jquery. Though you may not need jquery, it is being maintained in a responsible way where they remove shims and code as browsers support more features with straight JavaScript, so the computational cost of requiring JQuery goes down over time, and it isn't going anywhere fast due to all the PHP / Wordpress devs and people using it alongside serverside templating. You'll see Python and JQuery for many years--Python probably decades or more. What you won't see is lots of companies using ClojureScript and Rust until they grow large enough to be trusted by a manager that wants to somehow imagine the same application code will last forever. Go is just starting to reach that size but isn't quite there yet. Rust has a lot of enthusiasm among open source where merit trumps management decisions, but these things will take a lot more time to change in business. Npm is great in that it is a million times better than not having a package manager, and it is better to use the main package manage than to have fragmentation, but... Npm made mistakes--a number of them! The biggest might be the huge node-modules folder that often adds 30k files to an "empty" project. BUT, that chart wasn't about package management. It was about building specifically, and while Npm provides running of scripts (which I would always prefer be used over pulling in grunt or gulp since you already have npm present for package management anyway), the feature set offered in webpack is enormous. Pycharm Pro (not community) gives template completion support for frameworks like React, Angular, etc.
You can always look at the soundcloud API, they have code samples in python: https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/guide It doesn't seem like something particularly hard to do, but I wonder if it's allowed. I'm not familiar with how soundcloud approaches bots, but for some platforms that's not allowed (ex: facebook). If it is allowed, I'd suggest you do it yourself, it seems like a pretty cool project to learn more about python and APIs. That's the sort of project I got into to learn python.
Is it free?
Yes, the course is free. If you want the certificate, I think it's $40ish or so. &amp;#x200B;
Awesome design but not sure how to execute the code myself. I'm new to python and just trying to dissect the code. What do you use to run this? Also getting import gifmaze as gm ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'gifmaze' Sorry if all of this is pretty simple to answer &amp;#x200B;

I’m going to sign up for it later today. I think a study group is a great idea!
I just mentioned them as a jumping off point for those interested in learning. Here's a decent resource for c: http://mrbool.com/the-4-pillars-of-object-oriented-programming-in-java/33900 Polymorphism is the pillar that really made python classes click for me. Polymorphism is built upon the idea that several tasks in programming are effectively identical but their implementation varies according to inputs. For example addition between floats and addition between lists. In one case we want arithmetic in the other we want to concatenate. In order to implement this functionally we would need a massive addition function that checks for every possible combination of data types and then adds them together according to their types. Classes let us define the behavior of addition inside the data type (python data types are just classes). So if you add lists together the class will reference the list add method that is specific to the list class. The power of this approach is immense, we can now incrementally build functionality in a distributed manner rather than using one massive function capable of dealing with every edge case. That feature alone makes classes super useful. From there you should look at encapsulation which allows you to simplify data management by storing information inside the object itself and referencing it directly rather than juggling all of you variables and passing in and out of functions. I'm not a pro programmer but once the philosophy of oop bites you it's suddenly a much easier framework to work and think within.

My first project I am very very new to coding so I'm sure this will be trivial to the max but please bare with me as I will be an avid browser in this thread. Trying to build a dictionary of all local restaurants. Each restaurant containing its own list of possible user selections ie; fast food, steak, sushi, etc... User inputs desired food type and program spits out all restaurants equal to that value. Seems simple enough but we'll see how much I screw it up. Please tell me if I'm on the right track because this seems like a lot of coding. restaurants = [ { "McDonald's" : ["fast food"], }, { "Bob's" : ["breakfast", "American"], }, Etc for all restaurants where I live. Then, something like this to display matches, if type_of_food in restaurants == restaurants["user input"] Would appreciate nudges in the right direction 😅 
How will you fund the algorithm, I don't think I would code a trading algorithm without an equity stake or a large salary that would eclipse my cut of the trading profits.

The difference is that you will need to pass that counter instance around and that count is able to be altered by something other then the method. The closure "locks" the count variable in the scope of the outer function and since the only thing that still has access to that scope is the counter function it is the only thing able to access and modify count. It's basically a global counter that is almost but not quite a Singleton that can only be incremented and returned via the intended mechanism.... Sorry writing this quickly on my phone. Closures are awesome for shared connections to third party resources like databases.
Thank you that's extremely useful!

I retyped it from memory, my bad there.
Disclaimer: I'm a college student without much Python experience (mainly Java and C#) I'd create a class called "Restaurant" with fields for its name, location, etc. and an enumeration "Food" with the different foods. The class Restaurant also has a list that holds Foods (add them manually per instance) and a method checkFoodAvailibility(Food value) that checks if the user input (food) is in the list. User types a food, you loop through each Restaurant and displays every Restaurant where that method is positive. Was this helpful? 
Well, it's kind of unpredictable, in which order `pip freeze` will spit out the package list. Now, imagine something like this happening: Package X-0.0.1 depends on package Y-*.*.*, both of them were installed before you started your update process, package Y-0.0.2 was installed. Now, package X-0.0.2 in addition to previous dependency, added a new one, on package Z-*.*.*. However, the newest version of package Z-*.*.* is Z-0.0.1, which requires Y-0.0.1. Since your package X didn't explicitly state that it wants Y-0.0.2, then it will be downgraded in order to install package X. Finally, if `pip freeze` listed package Y before package X, then `pip` would first update Y, then, while updating X, it will downgrade Y. In other words, you will have started with X-0.0.1, Y-0.0.2, and ended up with (after upgrade) with X-0.0.2, Y-0.0.1, Z-0.0.1 (i.e. upgraded X, but *downgraded* Y). So, to answer your question about safety: whether you are going to call `conda update` or not, doing what you do with `pip` will, potentially, wreak havoc in your installation. So, it is not safe by any means, but the cases when it will fail aren't very common, so, in trivial situations, may even work the way you wanted.
If you want to up your webscraping game, learn how to use lxml. It's many orders of magnitude faster than Beautiful soup.
Hmmm. I have seen it pop up a few times here and there but never really gave much attention to it since every was using/recommending BS4. But will take a look at it, thanks!

It works fine for me.
I don't know Sublime, but you should focus on making the virtualenv working. The virtualenvs created by pipenv are nothing special in this regard. You can use pipenv from the commandline to configure your project and from this point on it is not really necessary to touch pipenv very often. Usually, adding and updating dependencies, as well as publishing a package is nothing you need as a workflow while coding in your editor.
The venv works fine, but running the build tools in Sublime defaults to the global python path. Ideally, I'd be able to run whatever editor I desire and have it hook through the venv. Hope that makes sense.

I really appreciate this type of content, it's perfect for what I'm working on. I'm going to try out this workflow for documenting my current project and see if it catches on with the group I'm in. Thanks for the contribution even if doesn't garner a lot of upvotes.
Just wondering why are you asking in a python subreditt are planning to make a program for this yourself using python?
Yep!
Yep, why not. Looks like feasible task and interesting project.

You can change the Python prompt using `sys.ps1` and `sys.ps2` which are set to "&gt;&gt;&gt; " and "... " in the interactive interpreter (and not defined otherwise). I change my to "py&gt; " because I don't like the way the default prompt is rendered in email as a third-level quote.
The poster is asking how to fix his bug in a closure. Answering the question by saying "don't use a closure" doesn't help him. (Especially since a class based solution is probably going to be bigger, slower and less efficient.)
Yes, and showing running code/examples ...;
I think that would be great!
And long before he calls `count()`, his `createCounter()` function fails with `UnboundLocalError`. That has to be fixed before you even get to the count/counter confusion (which is so trivial, so easily fixed, and nothing to do with closures, that I assumed it was a simple typo that the OP could fix themselves).
What? Why would I call an int? Declaring count nonlocal isn't an error, and it does solve the OP's closure problem. Did you try running the code with and without the nonlocal declaration?

My aunt is a host on a morning radio show 3 time zones ahead, starting at 3AM in my time zone. They don’t archive their shows, so I automated recording off of their streaming service so all of our west coast family can listen as well! Now just to upload it to a Dropbox or google drive so I don’t have to add it to the drive when I wake up... any advice?
Previously (before an edit), the code had `print(count())` three times. So changing the namespace of `count`, an int, would still fail to do anything meaningful since `__call__` is undefined for ints. OP has updated the code snippet now to properly `print(counter())` instead.
I am maintaining two Kodi plugins ([plugin.video.srfplaytv](https://github.com/goggle/plugin.video.srfplaytv) and [plugin.video.rtsplaytv](https://github.com/goggle/plugin.video.rtsplaytv)) which allow you to watch the content from the video library of Swiss Radio and Television. The first one is for the German speaking part of Switzerland, and the second one for the French speaking part. These two plugins share a lot of common code, so I'm currently extracting this shared code into a new Kodi script, that can be used directly by these plugins later. This will make it much easier for me to maintain these plugins in the future, and I might add a new plugin for the Italian speaking part of Switzerland (RSI).
Glad you found it helpful. Feel free to provide feedback on what works or doesn't work with your group.
OK, got it. But then we are back to my first response. This is no question about pipenv, but only about how to point the Sublime Build System to the Python executable in your venv. If you point it to the "python" or "python3" executable, it will automatically use the corresponding venv with its installed packages.
Would take me about an hour
Reading them aloud, like as in a audio/video clip? not as much Something like an annotated version, or a "no fear python" type would be. Which sounds like (or similar to) what you're saying, just in a text form. It makes it easier to refer to, both the two parts of it (code and explanation) and between my use and what it is so, a very good idea, I would just prefer to see it in text
Yes good idea!
Thanks!
Thanks for the feedback. I really like the idea of no fear python.
me too lmao. I really like the idea of helping along with the learning tip of "read code", and helping to explain code bases people are likely to use/see used

ok, so you are a noob with python. is there a programming language that you at _not_ a noob with? or are you a noob with programming in general? if the latter, then i think you are taking on too much of a learning project. if the former, then for a project of this level, i think you should use the language you already know and not try to combine something like this with the learning process, even if it's just learning a 2nd language. but to sortof answer your question, experienced programmers can use Python for a project like this, it can be done on Windows 7 or 10, and it can be made as a standalone app. i just wonder if _you_ fit into that category. so you want to make a compiler. what kind of code will this compiler be intended to compile? what kind of compiled product will it be producing? machine code?
is this the input code to be compiled? or is it the output the compiler needs to produce?
Hi! Why did you move from poetry to pipenv?
lots of programs are awkward to use because they are written by programmers that ha very little experience in doing anything but programming. it won't be long till when i need to check and be sure there is a real human pilot flying the airplane i am boarding.
You mean the process to upload the package? it's not that complicated but can get REALLY tricky really fast. Here is a really good article about this: [https://realpython.com/pypi-publish-python-package/](https://realpython.com/pypi-publish-python-package/) ...or you can get rid of the [setup.py](https://setup.py) and use [poetry](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry) with a pyproyect.toml file and create the the virtualenv, build your package and publish it. It's really nice and, by my experience, way faster than pipenv.
that's what open source is for. but we see far too few people doing it.
That is a good idea, it would be good to have the possibility to do so. I'll look into it, thanks!
Hello! I'm a bot! It looks to me like your post might be better suited for r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. That said, I am a bot and it is hard to tell. I highly recommend posting your question there. Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster. Show /r/learnpython the code you have tried and describe where you are stuck. **[Be sure to format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F)** and include which version of python and what OS you are using. *** ^(this bot is written and managed by /u/IAmKindOfCreative) ^(This bot is currently under development and experiencing changes to improve its usefulness)
It's `{% for ... %}`, not `{% foreach ... %}`. Everything else is ok; I ran your code here and all went good (after changing 'foreach' to 'for').
i've had to go to extremes to educate non-devs about different aspects of computers. my high school science fair project was titled "the programming concept: words that move machines". it won first place. a friend overheard one of the judges, an air force colonel, say when his group was walking away "now i understand what those things do".
This is a hefty job for moderators. You can't stop the tide.
Great work! Could you give me a timeline of how and what you did in Python after getting the basics done? I myself am well versed with the basics and not sure of how to proceed. Seeing as you've progressed to making your own library in just 9 months, I'd really like your input on this

I agree. It doesn't mean the vast majority of subscribers will agree. Reddit follows the laws of entropy and decay like all systems in the universe.
It'd be nice if people agree, but I can't stop 'em one way or the other. Posting an idea, however, in the hopes that some people take it to heart and help prevent the "do my homework", or "make my soundcloud sub bot", or "help me scrape the whole interweb" posts.
Funnily enough, after using the instagram api, I was fed up with how it wouldn't post some posts because of the size. So I went back to Selenium (since you can click the resize button before posting) and it has posted much more successfully since then. Not to mention I have now added the functionality to download videos off of instagram using Selenium as well. So yeah! Now I just gotta run it in headless mode.. somehow.
Yes. Also, maybe explaining how to digest a library. I remember studying philosophy that it took a while to get the hang of not reading cover to cover and such. Just a thought. 
Teach me how you made it!
sorry about the title but it is urgent for us cause we just found out that we were doing our project wrong. &amp;#x200B;
The link is not valid. Can you please share the code
And it's a problem to have questions here because ... ? If people didn't like it, they would get downvoted. It's a self-regulating problem.
What are you using to create the actual email contents? Just passing a string to the msg argument is going to get very odd results. The stdlib email is for creating or parsing email contents, and then you can pass an instance to smtpib for delivery. The email library handles all the serialization the msg argument needs on your behalf and you have complete control over things like encoding and MIMI types. https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.html
Dont' skip the reporting - I do remove them! It takes some time, but I do get to them.
Personally, I'd rather just be helpful. Nothing is more deflating to someone trying to learn than earnestly posting to a forum dedicated to the thing you're learning about than being harangued because you posted to the 'wrong place'. As long as we're all still talking about python, I don't know why we need to get our underwear twisted over something you can just as easily ignore.
The vast majority are downvoted. Many of them are unanswered. The reason you direct people to r/learnpython (and the Python discord) is to help people become more effective at finding solutions.
We also direct people to the [Python Discord](https://discord.gg/3Abzge7) which is a *great* place to have questions answered. Also, report them - I do try to clear the modqueue as frequently as I can!
Not questioning that you remove them, just noting that if a user agrees with this post but doesn't want to burden the mods more, that they can at the very least not answer.
Welp, it is against the subreddit rules, check the sidebar.
I intentionally unsubscribed from /r/learnpython to get away from the stupid questions asked by lazy people (as opposed to valuable questions asked by people who have done their due dilligence, which regrettably make up a minority of posts). However, I want to continue getting news about the language and community, have discussions about interesting libraries and implementation details, and so on. That distinction is why we have two subreddits in the first place.
Well, first I did a [cheat sheet](https://github.com/wilfredinni/python-cheatsheet) for personal use, and when people got interested in it, decided to do a website: [pythoncheatsheet.org](https://pythoncheatsheet.org) and thus, learned flask. Then just started building things: some command line tools, a bot for Reddit and Twitter, then a blog... lots of scripts... lots of reading and youtube videos. At some point started to read other peoples code and see how they formatted their code and solved certain problems. &amp;#x200B; I'm certainly not an advanced or even intermediate developer, but everything I've learned to this point was like a natural process. If you have the basics, I think you have to leave the books and tutorials and just start building things.
One solution would be an automoderator which (temporarily) removes posts reported as belonging in /r/learnpython, or even those which have X comments containing the string "/r/learnpython", immediately. The poster would get a message saying "This post may belong in /r/learnpython and has been temporarily removed from /r/Python. If /r/learnpython is a better fit for your post, click here; otherwise, click here to reinstate your original post.". If the user incorrectly reinstates a post, *then* they can get downvoted to hell.
It's something that comes over as assholish to people who are new to python and new to the reddit python community. Just be helpful or ignore those posts.
Being helpful encourages the posts, ignoring them is rude. Giving (polite) directions to the proper place to ask is a happy medium.
If restarts and stuff are not a problem, maybe you can also use the sched module in the standard library https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html
Then maybe phrase this differently, because it sounds super curmudgeonly and mean as written. Like "those damn kids get off my lawn". This is a welcoming community, if you can't find a way to enforce the rules while also being welcoming, then we change the rules, not become unwelcoming.
Looking at you StackOverflow...
Because it's the same questions over and over.
You forgot the question mark. 
Oops
See, this is a more positive and inclusive way to phrase the same thing :)
first thing I thought after reading the title was "fuck that, this isn't SO"
&gt; Personally, I'd rather just be helpful. Nothing is more deflating to someone trying to learn than earnestly posting to a forum dedicated to the thing you're learning about than being harangued because you posted to the 'wrong place'. Really, it's that defeating? "Hi, this subreddit is for discussion, not programming help. Please check r/learnpython or Discord for assistance with programming Python".. if that's gonna convince you to stop learning Python, I don't know what to tell you.
They may not know what SO is or are unfamiliar with the platform, or simply prefer reddit. I use reddit for stuff like this typically. 
You don't want people to ask questions here? Then what's the point of this sub? Just a python circlejerk like all the other language-specific subs?
Nor should you. This is just OP's opinion, not the official position of the sub. And frankly, I think OP's wrong.
I want to come here to read interesting articles about python without having to scour the internet for them first. It says right in the sidebar that this is not the place to come to ask questions about how to do something in Python.
&gt; The vast majority are downvoted. Many of them are unanswered. Sounds like a problem with the people who frequent this sub rather than with the sub itself. 
I think the next platform to integrate ML for tasks like this (natively, not with bots) will be the new reddit. Moderators would just flag posts and label which rule it violated, and ML could learn to recognise more. Mods can adjust the sensitivity rate.
One option is to configure AutoModerator to remove posts and leave a note in modmail when they have been reported more than once or twice, then approve the false positives. It's usually just a matter of trial and error to find the right threshold for each subreddit.
Then we're not answering them well enough!
Sorry to be so blunt, but I think this is ugly and unclear. I think namedtuples or classes are the way if you want to stop nesting dicts. It’s good that you’re thinking about these things though.
Just subscribe to the Python Weekly newsletter; 99% of its content is the best things posted to /r/python in the last week.
It's not hurting shit.
1) If this is the communities wish, then start a post to discuss and see if there is enough momentum to convince the mods to change the rules. 2) Posting articles related to a language as opposed to becoming another stackoverflow is not circlejerking. 3) The point is the share new/interesting things about python.
&gt;Then maybe phrase this differently, because it sounds super curmudgeonly &gt;and mean as written. Yeah; it's like we're supposed to be Haskell programmers or something! ;-)
No, the point is that people should check out the rules before posting in a subreddit and to utilize the subreddit for its intended purpose. I don't feel like wadding through several dozen homework questions to find something new and interesting about python.
&gt;#3: When I'm coding, I don't feel stupid anymore Just wait until the code review for that!
r/__main__
Yah that's not how that works.
They're being sarcastic, the behavior OP is asking for is the type of behavior SO is infamous for. If you ask a question that's remotely similar to another question, you'll get directed to the other "solution" even if you've tried it and it didn't work.
Would you be able to explain the `__get__` method you've implemented in `tworoutine.py`? I'm not sure how you'd ever get `self.instance` to evaluate `True` on L28. I understand descriptors for the most part, just not this completely.
I'm the author of /u/pythonHelperBot It is not ready to be a mod at all. Right now it has those keywords as flags, but also does some simple NLP to identify questions. Basically if a key phrase is used, 99% of the time it's a newbie question that should be on r/learnpython. But then it waits a period of time for reddit votes and then tries to classify the post as a low quality question. To avoid becoming spammy, the bot is really restricted in when it's allowed to comment if a title is missing a key phrase. I prefer false negatives over false positives, but because it's a real world system, it has false positives. This current setup is going to be a performance baseline for measuring a more complex classifier, but the complexity is taking time to build out. Basically it'll be a comparison to a database of stack overflow questions. Once I have that built out, I can test its performance and adjust its restrictions so I can get an idea of the quality of that classifier. Either way, the bot doesn't comment frequently right now, and does have enough false positives that it's comments shouldn't result in removed posts (yet). Honestly, the mods do a really high quality job filtering out the posts. There are lulls where it builds up somewhat because the mods all has personal lives, but even considering that, they're really on top of the low quality questions. (I've been watching pretty closely since around march or april this year) 
Is there a way to set them to a new value like you have done? Without having to configure then on each new instance
This question belongs in r/learnpython you'd be entree suited to ask there. /S
I disagree. Plenty of people here are not new to programming or python and come here for posts about the language and libraries and whatever else. It’s annoying to pollute subs with beginner questions. It’s not hard to usher people to the right sub for it.
If this were a more specific subreddit maybe it'd be better, but /r/python is huge, python is incredibly popular, and it's something beginners are bound to ask a million questions about. You're going to get newcomers every day of the week here. Most people just don't read the rules first thing whether they should or not. Really though how many people come here and ask a question, get redirected to /r/learnpython, then ask another question later and abuse it because it was answered? I just scrolled through like the first two pages of the new posts, looked at the questions, looked at their submissions and it was all like their first post to /r/python. /r/python is going to always have people breaking this rule whether we like it or not. 
my first Hilbert curve code took me 3 days. but that was long before Python and written in assembly.
I think you and the mods need to catch a hint from the downvoted that this is a bad decision. Make a separate subreddit for your sweet article posting if that’s what you want. There are so many people learning to program for the first time, and happen to choose python to be their first experience and exposure in our world. Getting rejected on a subreddit is a bad experience and may sour an otherwise hopeful student of programming. Not everyone has great resources to learn from.
Better to be helpful absolutely never hurts anyone. It is bad karma to hold an answer when you have it. Better to give it and recommendation that they post in the right sub next time where they might get more / better help. You can do that all in one post.
Honesty, that isn't what r/python ought to be IMO. r/learnpython should just disband, and /r/python should be the place for questions, while a new sub, something like /r/pythonnews or /r/pythondiscussion should be made for articles/discussion.
This isn’t a place to ask questions. Perhaps you should ask this in /r/learnpython /s I can’t resist a meta joke. 
Here’s my 2 cents (since everyone is jumping on the pile on here) There needs to be a sub that caters to intermediate to advanced questions within python. The extremely low-on-the-totem-pole questions within /r/learnpython cause me to vomit sometimes— I run to the hills of SO or wherever (and curation on that is pretty meh if you ask me— lots of items/approaches seem outdated and inadequate). Can someone (or bot) begin to separate the wheat from the chaff? 
you can get more than 256 colors in GIF. i wrote code to do this back in BP (Before Python) ages. google for "true color gif" to find out how and see some examples.
Yes, one can use local color tables to get more than 256 colors ~ but then one has to specify one such table for each frame (at least, in this animation) and the file size increases larger ~
Reddit itself, and all the myriad mobile clients, are not geared toward "newbie reads the rules before posting." This happens on EVERY sig forum everywhere. This issue is as old as the Internet itself, with uunet flamewars. It's not going to get fixed brcause humans aren't deterministic programs adhering to a shared deck of instruction cards.
Have you posted something interesting related to python? Probably not. I’d prefer seeing questions being asked than having people not post anything at all. Some of the questions asked are certainly interesting. 
Yeah, it's kind of a dick thing because it makes it clear that the poster isn't welcome in your community. You're fooling yourself if you think that people who take it upon themselves to 'police the sub' for 'off-topic' submissions are always going to do it in a gentle fashion. I'd much rather deal with having questions posted here than have this sub turn into the stackoverflow community. Those people suck.
there are lots (nearly infinite) choices for how you might want to do it or where. you can even do it on your smartphone if you can get access.
This is an issue that crops up in many subs and I just don't get it. It takes zero effort to ignore posts that don't interest me, but I'm sometimes amazed by what does. I'd never know if any of them had been filtered out.
I disagree, sure it takes away from what this subreddit is for somewhat, but that not a reason we can't be helpful. Tell them the proper place to ask questions for next time, then be a good person and help them out. It's not hard. If we just downvoted people to oblivion we will just look like an community of assholes to someone who is obviously new and just looking for some help. 
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
This subreddit is for things related to the programming language Python, not for things related to snakes. Your comment has been removed, but if it's cute enough, you might try posting to /r/aww
Watched this some time back. It was good, and I liked how he hammered home the point that you aren't going to remember every function of every library. That's something that beginners need to be made to understand too. Also, I learned that I had no mastery of my editor compared to this guy. lol
Hey I know this is an old thread but I don’t guess you have this on github or could provide me any direction if I wanted to try to do the same thing do you? This would be really helpful to me. 
Some rules are retarded. E.g. on Freenode, everything is offtopic in #c++ - in order to actually talk about anything, you have to use #c++-general.
I'm not very familiar with python, but does anyone know how one might turn something like this in to a Screen Saver for Windows 10?

News and discussion about the Python programming language, not debugging poorly written code or explaining what iterators are for the umpteenth time.
I was pretty much referring to your commit comments of "Fuck pyí" and "Hate PyPi". 
What's the deal? If you don't want to help someone then don't respond. Of course people are going to ask questions. 
Reddit is many things to many people. The whole point is that communities can largely self-regulate. Mods are definitely important to deal with things like spam, community takeovers, and general in-bad-faith stuff, but if something is "off-topic" for a subreddit then it gets downvoted, if it's "on-topic" it gets upvoted. If you use the default sorting, you are seeing a curated list of things that your fellow community members thought was awesome, effectively crowd-sourcing what is on or off topic :-)
And thank you for that. I think that if possible we should be striving to be stewards of the Python community. And that means being welcoming to those with questions. Yes, /r/learnpython is great and we should direct people there. But that doesn't mean we have to turn into scoffing elites, snobs who turn up their noses at the people looking in at our community and wondering if they can fit in. &amp;#x200B; Python is AWESOME! My first programming language and I'm so happy I started here. I don't feel any need to hide away what I've learned. I'm more than happy sharing it and helping other people learn.
Haha makes sense. I can understand the frustration 
I got this: runfile('C:/Users/WIN/.spyder-py3/untitled7.py', wdir='C:/Users/WIN/.spyder-py3') D:\Programs\Anaconda\pythonw.exe 
This is a really salient point and I respect that you came at with a programmers attitude, how can I make this better? IMO a subreddit called Python is a natural landing spot for people interested in Python. It doesn't serve the community as a whole to turn away people because they didn't land in the right spot first try. &amp;#x200B; But an advanced Python subreddit, that would give the new learner pause and perhaps say "I'll come back here when I know to ask the right questions" At least the ones with any pride and sense of proper etiquette.
I hope to one day be a good enough developer to make a meaningful contribution to Django. At this stage in life the framework is so mature it's non-trival to improve it. 
I think it's still helpful as long we point them to a more appropriate place to ask questions.
Thank you for your efforts! I get wanting to be conservative about it so that it doesn't become a nuisance. That said, I think the scheme I outlined above where it just "quarantines" suspect posts to remind the poster that /r/learnpython exists, and allows the poster to reinstate their own post if they disagree, sidesteps at least some of those issues.
[r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython) 
python_theory / python_news / advanced_python / python_gatekeepers there's enough possibilities and you're probably very right. And to be honest i think just not upvoting questions keeping the front page clean should be more than good enough. There's only so many good interesting articles about python a day having a few questions on the new page is a welcome distraction for me. 
What program do you use for the desktop webapps ?
/r/learnpython seems to be a place for beginners with beginner questions. Never had an intermediate or advanced question answered there, and the name certainly doesn't suggest that an experienced person wit a specific question should be asking there. Is there a subreddit where those questions would be welcomed and answered?
It could be written full-screen in large typeface in everyone's native language, with a four-part quiz implemented as a captcha, before you can read anything or post anything, and you'll still get posts which YOU think don't apply.
I'll check that out. Thanks
Not sure if I haven't done it already but I'll check out this one again. Thank you. 
So post that stuff...if that is what you are here for then great, but don't push others out because they aren't as advanced as you are.
&gt; I'm so tired of that excuse for not reading the rules. All you have to do on mobile is click on "About this community". How hard can that be? Really? On which mobile client? I had to dick around with the one I use to figure out how to find the subreddit rules. Sure enough, there's a way. If it weren't for your complaining, I'd have never even noticed because it's simply not relevant to me 99.9999% of the time. Moreover, newbies are going to find /r/python without knowing in advance what reddit is and without noticing the rules on the side bar anyway. It's like reposts. I hate reposts WITH A PASSION. But blah blah 10,000 new people every day blah blah excuse excuse. It's never going to stop. Just like people asking questions in /r/python is never going to stop unless you make the subreddit super caustic, maybe require everything to go through a mod queue before a post can happen, or disallow people without a certain amount of karma in /r/python from making new posts. If you want to be that draconian maybe you'll succeed. It'll suck though. You guys *really* need /r/advanced_python or something. That'd be so much more effective than just bitching at people. 
When you see a sub called /r/Python and you want to ask a question about Python, this seems like it would the appropriate place to ask. You shouldn't need to look at the rules. If I wanted to ask a question about sandwiches, and I went to /r/sandwiches ...and was told No sorry, this sub is only for professional chefs...I would feel pretty shitty about it...I might even decide that if the sandwich community doesn't want to help me then maybe I'll go join the Falafel sub instead. Screw those /r/sandwich jerks. :)
Not quite. Functions and methods are interchangeable terms, but a class in Python is much like a class in Java, and an enum is closer to a namedtuple (&lt; Python 3.4), a class extending Enum (Python 3.4), or a dataclass (Python 3.7). 
As a new learner and new member of this sub, thank you! 😊
The rules aren't unchangeable...I mean the mods probably won't change them, but they COULD be changed if the consensus of the subs users wanted them to. the rules should help a sub thrive, not make it seem like the community is full of assholes.
I think this post here is doing a pretty fine job of expressing the communities wishes.
How about &gt; https://github.com/DistrictDataLabs/yellowbrick
That works!
You can always do `x &amp; 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF` after the shift. But as has been mentioned already, Python is a wrong language for the kind of thing you are trying to do.
Sorry you're being downvoted a lot in this thread. I agree with you that it's super frustrating to have many of the r/Python posts be people asking SO-style questions (and having them answered) despite the explicit rules in the sidebar. That's not why I'm subscribed to this subreddit. That being said, I think many of the comments here are right: r/Python is too general of a subreddit name to be able to "stem the tide". People will come here, not read the sidebar, and post r/pythontips-style questions. Obviously I'm not condoning this behavior, but I think we're gonna have to accept it as a fact of life. So to me, it seems the best thing to do would be to leave r/Python as it is and make a different subreddit for more advanced topics (r/advancedpython?). Then we can share cool developments, debates on best practices nice lectures from EuroSciPy, or whatever, and we'll actually be sharing with the audience that wants to see it.
...from my experience, yes, we have.
Thanks for sharing. Im about to explore this vs dash/plotly. Im after some interactive dashboards/charts/data tables for data analysts (sales , product performance analysis ), will you suggest Bokeh or Dash for this?
Awesome advice. Thank you! 
1. You setup two cameras, and then capture two images from them at the same time. Or, you take a single camera and take two images from two different locations. 2. If you have two images you can create a *disparity map* with values that are proportional to the depth. To get the actual depth in meters you need to calibrate your cameras. I.e. their exact relation to each other must be known/measured. &gt; Some help would be really nice because I am really new to Python but I already coded with other languages. Given the questions I think you have more of a computer vision theory problem. Once you understand the geometry involved in stereo, using the OpenCV python bindings to create what you need is not that hard. Good luck!
This whole thread reeks of gatekeeping, tbh. If this sub is about python discussion in general, it's a hard argument to say that it *can't* include beginner help as well. 
IMO a better option would be to create/enforce tags on all posts, that way it's all here and you can filter out whatever you don't want to see.
As someone who doesn't really interact with front-end, why is it surprising that jQuery is still popular? 
Great mate!
Or /r/pythonnews
First a specific subreddit and then move on to all
My comment didn’t format correctly, but yeah. Lemme know
Not only JSON. Any data that can be loaded into Python dicts, lists, tuples, and generic types can be validated by the library. But if you mean the library doesn't generate HTML-code for input forms, yes, it doesn't provide the feature. It's out of scope.
Hi Monty.
Keras, surely? Matplotlib and pandas are such bread-and-butter data science libraries I would be hesitant to discuss them in a specific ML post... I would also add hyperopt to the list but not sure how frequently that's used.
This is basically what I came here to comment. 
though it is fair to expect that things will get worse as Python keeps gaining even more popularity
&gt; Python is AWESOME! My first programming language Python is AWESOME! Not my first but very likely my last programming language. All my attempts to learn anything else have failed Of course I'm joking but half of it is truth: I've yet to find out another programming language that will have an impact as big on me as a programmer.
Well the first thing I think when I think about SO is "fuck that, what a bunch of twats on that site." I was mainly making a comment about how horrible an experience SO can be :p
&gt; The people there are SO nice and polite and wonderful and helpful! was that sarcasm?
Better idea, @OP, implement a BOT that checks every submission's text for a '?', then automatically posts a reply which says "If this post is asking for python help, please delete this submission and repost it in r/&lt;whatever&gt; with a guiding hyperlink.
I understand your feeling, but I'll disagree with you on this. I have a few safeguards against becoming overly spammy. The most important being never comment on any post by a user who has a previous post the bot commented on. So if the bot messages you, it should never message you again (unless I lose my database, which will happen eventually, though I make backups to help mitigate the scope of that eventual failure). I thought about the private message angle, but then you'll have multiple people (or bots) performing the same action without anyone being able to see. Beyond that (and more importantly), if the bot makes a mistake, it deserves downvotes, not to hide in obscurity. It doesn't delete it's comments at any point because I feel like hiding from its mistakes is unethical and it deserves the downvotes. (Though I'm still torn between keeping the comment to own its mistakes, and deleting the comment to reduce clutter. I think owning the mistake is more important though, since it lets everyone, not just myself, see the bots success next to its failure, rather than reweighting it so the bot looks like it performs better.) A comment creates ownership. Other redditors votes determine usefulness. Moderators are more easily able to step in if necessary and ban it. I feel like the bot usefulness outweighs any arguable clutter. It makes one comment with an outline of things to keep in mind when posting on /r/learnpython, and doesn't make comment replies. If the bot were perfect, a private message might work, but it will never be, and accountability is very important to me. And finally, usually when the bot comments, there are less than two other unique and non-OP commenters on the thread. "Help me print "hello world"" just doesn't draw redditors. Now, I know plenty of bots that I think operate in a way that is spammy and pure clutter and noise producing. So I work to keep this bot from acting that way, and I do understand the argument against it. But I feel /u/pythonHelperBot does a fair job of helping new redditors, while minimizing spam and still being accountable to its actions. 
From my various tests, pretty much no XML package out there is able to do that (hell, all of them will alter break some existing formatting — mostly but not exclusively inside starttags). You have to deal with it yourself by adding padding whitespace, in ElementTree using the `.text` (leading text pseudo-node) and `.tail` (following-sibling text pseudo-node) of the various elements. That aside, it's really annoying that you don't provide actual runnable code, my experiments with code I find sensible leads to a completely different result (and one matching my expectations unlike yours) for test case 1: `A\n&lt;whitespace&gt;` is a single text pseudo-node, so an element being inserted at the head of `a` would be stuck to `a.1`, not inserted in the middle of the text &gt;&gt;&gt; r = ET.fromstring("""&lt;foo&gt; ... &lt;root&gt;ROOT&lt;/root&gt; ... &lt;a&gt;A ... &lt;a.1&gt;A.1&lt;/a.1&gt; ... &lt;a.2&gt;A.2&lt;/a.2&gt; ... &lt;/a&gt; ... &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; ... &lt;/foo&gt;""") &gt;&gt;&gt; r.find('a').insert(0, ET.Element('a.3', text='A.3')) &gt;&gt;&gt; print(ET.tostring(r, encoding='unicode')) &lt;foo&gt; &lt;root&gt;ROOT&lt;/root&gt; &lt;a&gt;A &lt;a.3 text="A.3" /&gt;&lt;a.1&gt;A.1&lt;/a.1&gt; &lt;a.2&gt;A.2&lt;/a.2&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/foo&gt; 
As someone that doesn't have that much time to browse Reddit, I was about to suggest the bot approach. It's awesome to see that someone has already decided to run with that idea. Are you open source? It sounds like a great project! I agree with the stance that a couple people have had here - we should try to be as welcoming and helpful as possible, and that's something we try to take to heart on the Discord community as well. It's kind of inevitable that people will ask for help here - especially beginners, who it's important to make a good impression on. I always felt like what we wanted was *more* Python developers in the world. If we're going to achieve that, we need to not ruin the first impression for beginners, or scare them off. I still think the bot is a helpful solution, but in our experience, people really hate that impersonal touch given by an automated reply. I wonder if there's something we can do to soften the blow a bit? 
Python is a coding language you fool
Snakes came before damn computers nerd
Same dude. I hate this coding shit I want some actual post about pythons.
 I'm not an expert by any means but after doing dozens of Python-based projects ranging from web scraping, database (MySQL and Google Cloud services), [data analytics,](https://www.learntek.org/blog/what-is-data-analytics/) mini-games, and machine learning, I've definitely gained plenty insights on Python and its amazing technologies. Basically, to become an expert, you just have to dive right into the language and do all kinds of projects that come to mind. As you get more complex with those projects, you'll find yourself easily sifting through the official Python docs and stackoverflow, where the community is very much so thriving and teeming with knowledge you didn't know you should be aware of. Also, holding a job of some sort helps too, since you'll feel some pressure to do more and be better. Apologies for the lack of links and external references. I'm currently on my phone and wanted to type this up immediately.
/r/learnpython 
Yah, youre weird?
Yes. Someone is having trouble and took the time to write something out. They come back, excited about the new notification-just to find out some subreddit mall cop wants them to go somewhere else. 
I'm working on CLI TODO tool. Simple usage, pure python 3.6. No dependencies. &amp;#x200B; Code is here: [https://gitlab.com/n1\_/eagle](https://gitlab.com/n1_/eagle)
The correct solution is to move the more involved news/technical discussions to a different subreddit. r/Python is the obvious and intuitive place for new comers. I think it was a mistake in making this an intermediate / advanced python subreddit.
I think the name of the subreddit is fatally wrong for it not to be beginner friendly. It was a mistake to make this subreddit for intermediate / advanced python... we should have an r/pythonx or r/advpython subreddit.
Pycharm sometimes has a little bug where it does that even when the reference to the library does actually resolve. Probably the same bug and it has been fixed for the next release... 
Cool, that makes sense to me. I eventually just disabled the error message haha but I was just worried that somewhere else down the line there actually would be an import error. Oh well I'll roll with it for now. Thank you.
No. Are you worried about pushing two day old posts down? Reading help posts can be beneficial to everyone. That’s my opinion.
&gt; 10000% this. ... &gt; I've picked up a wide range of new skills/knowledge bases over the years It is not too late to pick up math. ;-)
Hello! I'm a bot! It looks to me like your post might be better suited for r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. That said, I am a bot and it is hard to tell. I highly recommend posting your question there. Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster. Show /r/learnpython the code you have tried and describe where you are stuck. **[Be sure to format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F)** and include which version of python and what OS you are using. *** ^(this bot is written and managed by /u/IAmKindOfCreative) ^(This bot is currently under development and experiencing changes to improve its usefulness)
Then go and read /r/learnpython. Personally I do not have the time to read about 35 variations over "Please guess what my homework assignment is and make it for me" interwowen with 40 to 50 questions about how to get anacona to install the packages needed to screen scrape something and post it to reddit after the ML model have NLP'd it.
But just look at the sub, a whole bunch of day old posts as early as page one and two. It’s not hard to find these articles and it’s not like these questions are pushing that content out. It’s just making the sub more lively and keeping people here. The content you want is still there. Articles aren’t being buried by questions, there just aren’t many Python posts to be made that aren’t questions.
Python in Android? When? 🤓
Are you aware how much moderation is currently taking place? You need to look at the number of posts in /r/learnpython to see the real load. 
You’ll get more help at r/learnpython. 
But it’s not for intermediate / advanced python. It’s *about* python not about *learning* python.
Thanks for the pointer. Much appreciated.
Hundreds of beginners end up asking a question here instead of going straight to learn python. Someone is doing something wrong... and blaming the new comers is the best way to be toxic.
[Use the `PYTHONSTARTUP` file.](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONSTARTUP) This also works in Python 2. The file itself is pure Python, nothing tricky there: import sys sys.ps1 = "NOBODY expects the Spanish Inquisition! " The only tricky part is setting the `PYTHONSTARTUP` environment variable permanently. I have no idea how to do that in Windows, but on Linux, you can put it in your `.bashrc` file: export PYTHONSTARTUP=/home/monty/python/startup.py and whenever you log in, it will be set for you automatically. (This assumes you use bash as your shell, if you have no idea what I'm talking about you probably are using bash, but if you aren't, you need to find out which shell it is, and find the appropriate incantation to use.)
Well, guess I got whooshed then lol. 
we 1000x nao.
Sure is. Check out the Arcade library: http://arcade.academy

The resolution was embarrassingly simple. Apart from the obvious error in my template, I was using the wrong template name. Thank you all for the help and apologies for taking up your time. 
from os.path import exists if exists(file_name): with open(file_name, 'a') as fh: fh.write('Ask /r/learnpython for more info.')
Hello Sir have a question for you I want to add an element to a list how do I do this in Python langage please reply as soon as asap,,,
I think python can be great for making games. Ever check out pyGame? 
\pi.tɔ̃\ https://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/python
This is highly surprising; I'm French (maybe you are too) and even in academia I think the average English level is terrible.
“We” haven't done anything. It was a long time ago, and nobody should be held accountable for their ancestors' actions (were them good or bad)...
Not to sound like a dick but I've completely stopped visiting this sub because it's nothing but questions and beginner stuff. I only see posts like this that make it to my front page.
Hello time traveler.
Thanks! Just checked in a change that enables you to change the parameters in realtime as the video is playing. This is a capability that would not be possible if using the command line version and thus shows the benefit of a GUI beyond making the initial parameter input easier. [https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/48845583-e4752980-ed6a-11e8-9b2f-6c3d5d2442ba.jpg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/48845583-e4752980-ed6a-11e8-9b2f-6c3d5d2442ba.jpg) &amp;#x200B;
Yes, that's what people _should_ do, but that's beside the point I was making. /r/python is a logical first stop when you have a question. Decades of experience should tell us that people usually don't read FAQs or rules before posting. It has real costs for moderators to moderate and users to read questions that break the rules. Perhaps we should re-think the current paradigm that guides people into making posts into the wrong place? If your town decides to make stop signs white triangles 16" from the ground, how much blame do people running stop signs deserve for running stop signs? After all, the town planners can say "well it's all printed in the brochure you can pick up right outside of town"! I would say, yeah, people running those stop signs fucked up, but the town planners also fucked up by not accounting for the way human beings actually work... 
And here I am in Almaty, learning Pascal and algorhytms
I think the threshold is feeling literate in how to go about using python to glue anything and everything together. 
I fuck with pygame 
Very much agreed, I prefer the idea of being a welcoming community to one that says "oh sorry this is the wrong department, here let me transfer you so you can say all the things you told me to someone else who might give a " That said, I like /u/anders987's suggestion of effectively merging /r/learnpython and /r/python and moving topics in here into something like /r/advancedpython or, per /u/neuroneuroInf's suggestion, /r/pythonnews Whichever way we slice it, I think that any post asking for help should be both answered (as appropriate) and also direct the asker to resources that are likely to better serve their needs.
Even though I spend quite some time browsing "funny" subreddits, this actually made my day.
It's great to be idealistic but you're not being realistic. &gt; User who is asking very basic questions about Python which can probably be answered by using google. Install this random ass program that most of us have probably never heard of to join our empty support area because 99% of people don't have it installed and instead use Discord.
&gt; Don't think so. Most get removed by mods thankfully. Every morning on my news crawl I end up reporting at least 10 posts that are very basic questions.
Formatted correctly, it looks like this: from os.path import exists file_name = '/home/pi/hello_world.py' if exists(file_name): with open(file_name, 'a') as fh: fh.write('Ask /r/learnpython for more info.') 
Unfortunately filtering on tags doesn't work on the official mobile app IIRC. Filtering based on tags is also just searching for things that don't have a specific tag or a janky CSS hack on the desktop site last I checked as well.
The way it happens in /r/python is that either a bot posts a helpful suggestion to go to /r/learnpython or a person says &gt; This belongs in /r/learnpython I can't remember seeing anyone being an asshole when doing this and I see it happen every day.
The problem is that quality content is much more difficult to create than beginner questions, and as such, it will be posted less of it. Thus, if we allow beginner questions it will be difficult to find the quality content were come here for.
&gt; If this sub is about python discussion in general, it's a hard argument to say that it can't include beginner help as well. It's really easy to check what this sub is about, read the side bar: &gt; News about the dynamic, interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, extensible programming language Python &gt; If you are about to ask a "how do I do this in python" question, please try r/learnpython or the Python discord.
Nope. Check out https://www.khanacademy.org. You can take everything from algebra to multivariable calculus.
All the programming language subreddits I visit operate the same way as this sub. The main language sub is for discussion and news regarding the language, support questions are directed elsewhere. A while back the mods weren't so strict about enforcing the /r/learnpython rule and this was the worst sub for me to weed through.
I don't think most people here understand the volume of these posts that the mods remove. I certainly don't know the total number but I report probably over a dozen throughout the day if not more.
Instead of posting a picture of your homework and saying 'help with bottom one', try working through the problem, then if you get stuck posting a well worded, descriptive question. I want this to be a helpful, welcoming community but questions like this lead for posts that call for the removal of all questions from this sub. If you're genuinely stuck on this, try posting in r/learnpython, but you should still phrase this better than you have.
If you want to set up an alternative, and it gets traction, I'll help promote that as well.
Traitre. Tu renvoies une mauvaise image de la France à l'étranger avec tes commentaires... on peut se chamailler à la maison , mais il faut faire front commun à l'international. Les allemands, les chinois et les americains l'ont bien compris..sauf nous visiblement. Un peu de dignité, surtout en ces jours.
Something being easy to do doesn't necessarily mean it's 100% the best thing to do. Remember, what this thread is arguing about is incredibly easy to solve, "just ignore the threads you don't want to see", but apparently that's too difficult. Look, I get your annoyance. But are you also going to pitch a fit about some advanced question someone fields about a script? Or is it just the *beginner* questions that bother you? 
Are you studying somewhere? 
&gt; "just ignore the threads you don't want to see", but apparently that's too difficult. I'm not sure you understand the volume of posts that are being removed. &gt; But are you also going to pitch a fit about some advanced question someone fields about a script? No because advanced questions are often instead a discussion about the language instead of "How do I reverse this string?".
Tip: TK is not sufficient for games. Use something a little more advanced. It's not that TK can't do it, but it requires digging deep for game-level graphics (typically on a virtual canvas), so it would be better to learn a more game-specific library for your graphics needs. PyGame and Arcade have graphics facilities. Even MatPlotLib would be a better choice than TK for game interfaces, and would take advantage of your vector graphic skills. Check out the [many game libraries](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonGameLibraries) available, to make it easier on yourself, so that you don't feel like giving up as easily as before. &amp;#x200B; A word of warning: If you are thinking of going from simple 2D games to 3D, I would delay that impulse. I feel that 3D graphic libraries in Python are still in their infancy, and have a long way to go before they are accessible by relatively new game-makers. &amp;#x200B;
Not an expert but according to [PyPi Friendly Readme](https://packaging.python.org/guides/making-a-pypi-friendly-readme/) you probably need to include the "content type" of "text/markdown". Sounds like it was newly implemented earlier this year and you'd need to make sure setuptools, twine, and wheel are very recent. Another [Step-by-step page.](https://dustingram.com/articles/2018/03/16/markdown-descriptions-on-pypi)
Well I figured it out! I had to create a project file and edit the project file to point to the venv exe. { "folders": [ { "path": "." } ], "virtualenv": "venv", "build_systems": [ { "name": "venv", "cmd": ["$project_path/.venv/Scripts/python.exe", "-u", "$file"] } ] } Since I have the luxury to work remotely, it was an imperative that I can setup-and-go with my projects from whatever machine I have for the day. I store the venv locally within the project (`.venv`) to make this possible. Now I've got a simple batch script that spins up a new venv at a directory with all the boring setup parts done.
Use pysimplegui, so far it's been a blessing for me, creating GUI in Python can suck so hard but the guy behind it has really made it extensible and great.
&gt; I learned that I had no mastery of my editor, compared to this guy. lol It's like he just thinks and then things happen on screen, seems like magic at times.
Stomping newbies for failing to RTFM has been a time honored tradition for longer than I've been alive, but it still isn't very nice. 
Hey! I dont have it on a public git repo but that would be a very little thing to do. Its however very rough as most of the logic are in the Qlik Sense script. What I do is more or less looping over and dump out all the data into individual files for the different positions. If that still sounds like something useful, let me know and I see what I can do to publish it. Br K
Telling newcomers to use a different sub isn't going to help reduce new questions. It just guarantees that the beginner will be frustrated. They aren't going to learn from it because once they've been told, they ask on the correct place either way usually. What you'll get is simply way more threads with no answers. Everyone has been annoyed by the top Google results being links that say the equivalent of "just Google it" and we don't need to make redirecting to /r/learnpython the same thing. If you just want news, you should make a /r/pythonnews so that it's clear what goes where. On other programming sebreddits you often get timid apologies in questions saying sorry for potentially asking on the wrong subreddit. Those could be people who started with Python and got frustrated. *The most obvious destination should be the correct place for the people with the least information.*
Who in the hell is talking about "stomping newbies"? Redirecting them to a subreddit where their questions are appropriate and will be more attentively addressed isn't stomping them.
Most developers have probably never heard of Discord and are wary of someone telling them to install a desktop application to ask a question. Reporting them is even worse. It sends a strong signal that Python is not friendly to newcomers if the most obvious place to go spends significant effort to not answer questions.
You cannot take actions based on what people *should* do. The fact is they don't, so you need a system which works when people do not read the rules.
[Added](https://github.com/metaperl/python-oop/wiki/Videos). 
I don’t mind the n00b programmer questions. I do mind the constant wannabe data scientists asking about machine learning. 
&gt; Most developers have probably never heard of Discord If you haven't heard of Discord and do anything with computers, then that's an issue. Moreover, if you work with computers, figuring out what a new technology is should not be a problem. &gt; wary of someone telling them to install a desktop application to ask a question. You don't have to install anything at all! Discord is browser based. If you want to install the desktop application you can, but there's no need to do so at all. &gt; It sends a strong signal that Python is not friendly to newcomers if the most obvious place to go spends significant effort to not answer questions. I think it's important to be friendly to newcomers, and the messaging that we use (and one of the reasons I ask people to report things) is quite friendly. However, people who are looking for help with things should understand that their first inclination isn't always the right one. I see similar things happening on Stack Overflow; people ask questions without doing an iota of research, and then feel like they haven't been welcomed when their question gets removed or marked as a duplicate. When you're asking for help, you have the responsibility to: * do some research about how to answer your question * do some research about where to ask your question * accept that the answer to your question might be "this isn't actually the place to ask questions" If you lack those things, then you're not going to make it as a programmer.
Use the ML Automod to delete all questions asking “where is ML 101 so I can become a data scientist”
I think you have misunderstood. This isn't a place for asking "how do i do this in Python" at all, no matter the level. All "how do I approach this problem" questions are currently against the rules, not just beginner questions.
hmmm...
But then you're just, again, showing preference to more advanced users of the language than the less advanced. It comes back to you don't want *beginner* questions here, not just you don't want *questions about learning python* here. That's a distinction you're allowed to make. But it's really frustrating to people trying to figure out "is my question advanced enough to ask?". Either say "no questions about how to write python" or "all questions about writing python". Learnpython is not beginnerspython, so even the advanced questions should be posed *there*. But then this sub loses the discussions that could come from them. So my perspective is just take the bad with the good and truck on. Also as it's been pointed out, and not accusing you of having done it, but there's a big difference between "Hey, this would be better answered in /r/learnpython" and "Get this off here, read the sidebar ffs".
mods woke up
I only speak Python. Did you mean: mod != “awake”
print(“understandable, have a nice day”)
then they can give their 110% at learning maths
Ok so what is this sub really about?
&gt;Trying to split this established subreddit will be a bigger disaster than the early days of 3.X A sticky at the top would easily take care of this, and wouldn't be even close to a "disaster".
&gt;They come back, excited about the new notification-just to find out some subreddit mall cop wants them to go somewhere else. Exactly! This is SOOO discouraging! We the "advanced" users should be the ones to have a special sub for python news/discussion, not the other way around. Honestly reddit mods, and bots that auto remove/ban are what make reddit suck.
They probably come from someplace over their. 
I have to resist the temptation to just throw a link to "how to ask questions the smart way." When someone doesn't even try to research before asking, it comes across selfish and devalues the community.
Tags don't work for anyone not using a browser.
There is something called open source and you should know that. Education is non profit and data is for everyone. I asked the question because programming language is the one thing everyone should know and should be there even when people can’t afford it but very eager to learn. If you can’t support it may be you shouldn’t comment on people. Peace ✌🏻. 
The #python IRC channel on FreeNode is always active and helpful, with over a thousand people online any time.

As a NASA engineer who occasionally works with 3D printers (which this code clearly is given the thing about gcode and an extruder), "TC" is obviously for "thermocouple" and "temps" is obviously "temperatures." Not everyone is a computer-science trained developer writing deployable production code for a customer. I'd say there's like a 90% chance this is an intern who learned python in recent months writing something cool to automate work his team is doing on a small research project (especially since the username on the other screenshot is in the NASA address book as an intern at JSC).
Definitely temperatures... TC is thermocouple and temps is temperatures. Makes sense in the context of automating a 3D printing rig of some kind which this appears to be doing.

Great call - I've added that to the sidebar, and I'll add it to the removal note as well.
They're images come from wheir?
I'm not sure where these particular releases get their images, but you can make your own from publicly available images, using a bit of image manipulation magic. &amp;#x200B; [https://medium.freecodecamp.org/sketchify-turn-any-image-into-a-pencil-sketch-with-10-lines-of-code-cf67fa4f68ce](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/sketchify-turn-any-image-into-a-pencil-sketch-with-10-lines-of-code-cf67fa4f68ce) &amp;#x200B; [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42073941/convert-image-to-pencil-drawing-not-pencil-sketch-using-imagemagick](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42073941/convert-image-to-pencil-drawing-not-pencil-sketch-using-imagemagick) &amp;#x200B;
Python provides lots of behavior to objects There is some top level syntax that allows programmers to plug into some underlying functionality Often times that is through “Dunder” methods
Copyright plugin, finally!
TL;DW: Protocols: Python is a protocol based language. What this means is that any operations you want to do have corresponding underscore methods called data models. For example, `__init__`, `__enter__`, `__next__` etc. Metaclasses: Sometimes “library developers” need to make sure “user developers” implement a certain method in the subclasses they define, and metaclasses help to accomplish this. Decorators: Sometimes you want to modify the behavior of a function **F** slightly for a specific purpose, but you don’t want to alter the code of the function itself. So you create a decorator function **G** that takes **F** as an input and produces your slightly different function as an output. Instead of hardcoding `F = G(F)` to get the modified behavior, you just put `@G` above the definition of F. Generators: A generator is like a function, except it’s actually an iterator. For example, instead of doing a computation and appending the result to an output list that you return at the end, you simply yield each computation as it occurs. This is useful whenever you want “library code” and “user code” to interact in an “interleaving” manner—the library code should use generators to **yield** control to the user code. So the user code will ask the library code for the next result from the generator, do a computation with that result, and then ask for the next result from the generator. That way, the user code doesn’t have to wait for the entire result from the generator.
Along with using namedtuples, I'd recommend overriding `__getattr__` as well as, or instead of, `__getitem__` so you can use `fruits.banana.color` instead of `fruits['banana'].color` or `fruits['banana']['color']`.
Good catch -- the descriptor implementation was not fully ported over from the Tornado version of the same code, and I was clearly not testing it. I just fixed the descriptor code and pushed out a few short unit tests. Thanks for trying it out.
Then adobe illustrator it is xd. I will create my custom icons, but kind a liked those ones...
Interesting... They look a little sharp pencil more than chorcoal drawings using that implementation
I ended up using 2 classes with souped-up metaclass that allows iterating over the static class, doing reverse lookups on the class attributes and some other stuff. I don't know if this is the best approach (it was quite more complex than what I proposed on the OP - that took me 10 minutes to prototype, while I spent about 1h30 fine-tuning the Metaclass and constant classes), but I think it's worth trying it for a while. The thing I liked about implementing using classes is that it's quite flexible and it's mostly IDE friendly, since I mostly wont need to use strings to reference the data. Here's how it looks: from _constants import ConstantMetaClass class Shortcut(object): """ Class representing a shortcut. """ def __init__(self, sequence:str, text:str) -&gt; None: self.sequence = sequence self.text = text def __str__(self): return f'&lt;Shortcut:({self.sequence}) {self.text}&gt;' def __repr__(self): return self.__str__() class Shortcuts(metaclass=ConstantMetaClass): """ Container class for all the Shortcut values. """ add_game = Shortcut('Alt+A', 'Add game') game_launcher = Shortcut('Alt+L', 'Open Games Launcher dialog') plugin_manager = Shortcut('Alt+P', 'Open the Plugin Manager') quit = Shortcut('Ctrl+Q', 'Quit application') restart = Shortcut('Ctrl+R', 'Restart application') games_tab = Shortcut('Ctrl+1', 'Switch to games tab') journal_tab = Shortcut('Ctrl+2', 'Switch to journal tab') settings_tab = Shortcut('Ctrl+3', 'Switch to settings tab') assert Shortcuts.add_game.sequence == 'Alt+A' assert Shortcuts['add_game'] == Shortcuts.add_game assert Shortcuts.key(Shortcuts.add_game) == 'add_game' &amp;#x200B;

I’ve been having a hard time getting my first python job. Nobody uses it locally so the project are what I can fit in between work and going back to school for yet another BS... If I could get a job I wouldn’t need to go to school - is there any way to work remotely out of the gate?
I feel like this is with every language. I used to view it as reading a book and learning it. But its more using it as soon as possible and reading a book on the side to discover neat things.
The sub's not called /r/herpetology.
Thank you very much. Only if I had more than one upvote
Thanks &amp;#x200B;
Python doesn't have switch/case statements but yes in other languages you could implement the same thing with a case statement.
Yes it is. Python is a bit of an outlier by not having a dedicated switch/case statement.
Thank you sir/madam for the kind explanation
Serves me right for doing something I knew could backfire - thanks!
Good bot.
Try to move an old PHP solution over to flask. Seams like a decent first flask project.

I don't have experience with it, but Django should be good. Django definitely supports [SQL databases](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/db/sql/). &amp;#x200B;
Like pythonanywhere.com?
I'm a Python beginner. I'm currently messing around with some calls in the Destiny 2 API to do some stuff with a Unicorn PHAT on a pi for fun. 
I think what /u/NicolasGuacamole meant was a situation in which people came here asking questions about pythons (the animal).
Ah, I thought you were doing something fancy that I couldn't see. It looks like `instance` attribute is entirely unused in your tworoutine class and a holdover from something in Tornado, then? In the prior version, it appeared that it was possible to setup `tworoutine` via a factory method, by providing it the instance during initialization. In the current version, `tworoutine.instance` goes entirely unused. --- I got excited, because I'm doing something similar with a scheduling api that allows users to submit async or sync jobs, but also have decorator/descriptor functionality.
I hope they support jupyter notebooks property this time
Yes. Of course you can implement just about anything.
most often, personal projects are most important than certificate. Do some coding, put it on github, blog about it, write documentation etc
Yes but that isn’t something unique to python.
Remote positions are usually meant for mid to senior level developers. Although, sometimes junior positions do appear. I'd say freelance and pick up 15$ projects until you have reviews and then you can pick up some 100$ ones.

Try throwing this up on r/learnpython and see what they say. 
Just coming up with the ideas for person projects is so damn hard lol. But thank you for the reply! 
An obvious personal project that accomplishes just having a project but also building a portfolio is building your own website using Flask, Django, or another similar module. You can incorporate all sorts of things in the website such as a blog and little tools you may write in python or another language. 
Running the same code block over and over again hoping for output is getting tiring

This is just a video about syntax and how the language works. Knowing this doesn't make you an expert. Just because you read a design pattern book doesn't mean you know how to use design patterns, in practice it just means you know of design patterns and how to use them on toy examples. I went in hoping for some good real world examples but instead got someone trying to show off syntax. You could get the info in this video from reading the docs.

I think I interpreted the reporting as being a way to ban people, but looking through your post history, I see that your message seems pretty good. I spent more time in other subreddits (Go and Dotnet) where I see people often apologize in advance for asking questions, and I just always think they must have come from here. But again, your message seems well-worded. I do agree that Python is a big enough community to segregate into two. I just think it's done backwards with the more obvious one in "front" so to speak. In terms of Discord, I only just heard of it, and a very unscientific poll of other developers (all polled being over 30 years old like me) did not reveal anyone else using Discord (though some had heard of it). I, having recently heard of it, thought I did my due diligence: downloading the desktop app, reading about it, and then adding the golang discord channel to observe. I didn't notice a web client and I also read things that made me think that Discord was mostly used by gamers, so I'm guessing your impression comes from mostly knowing developers aged 18 to low 30s or simply knowing developers that are gamers. I'm 33 but don't play games, so I'm probably in the group not likely to hear of these types of things quickly, which is too bad because of of the best things in programming are researched by game developers first. Maybe you're mostly right about Discord, but I don't think the assumption is perfect. I teach a Meetup with a lot of middle aged people changing careers (code camp students) and I'm guessing the average person there would be as hesitant to download Discord (and not realize you could use it online) as I was a short time ago.
Python can be pretty good with games, though there are ups and downs to programming with it. There are a couple of different libraries for it like Pygame, Kivy, Panda3D (but not many use it), Pyglet, and PyOpenGL (though that requires Pygame). The only real problem with it is Python being a data-heavy language can slow games down once you're handling a lot of data and drawing stuff to the screen simultaneously (Though that doesn't happen all too often). But I would definitely give it a shot if you're feeling up to it.

 I'm not open source yet. There's a set of core features I want to have largely developed before I open source it, that way I can minimize the amount of code wrangling I have to do. There's just too much about the bot that I want to change each iteration. That said in my opinion the bot should be a community tool, and open to the community, so it will be open source eventually. I also agree, welcoming is pythonic. And I know automated replies aren't exactly welcoming, especially when the reply boils down to "post somewhere else". At this point in the bot, there isn't much I can do to get around that, short of not running the bot at all. To help soften the blow, I wrote the message be as kind as possible, (and with some help) get it to be as helpful as possible as well, including linking to ways to format code for reddit. It's a bit of a balancing act, but I think its message is generally preferable to a comment that just says, "/r/learnpython". I'm always looking for helpful ways to phrase its reply!

It's a super tricky problem, isn't it? On one hand, you need automated tools to really manage the torrent of questions, but on the other hand, beginners don't really like being told to go elsewhere by a bot.

Hey, that's my sub! I thought about making an ML bot that x-posted everything from r/python to r/pythonnews ... unless it was a question. But it ended up in the pile of things not started. If there is actual interest, I'd do it for the python community. 
WSL Interpreters PRO ONLY :(
I made r/pythonnews 3 years ago. Nobody posts anything. If even two redditors thought it was worth seeding it with content, I'd do it.
If you don't mind implementing full websites for $15, I can make up some work for you so that I can reuse them later. :) For that price I'd suspect some type of straightforward data manipulation or modifications to existing projects.
Honestly, JetBrains subscriptions are a no-brainer in terms of value. For just PyCharm, it's $9/mo -- which is less than a typical streaming subscription. Especially considering that you get a [perpetual license](https://sales.jetbrains.com/hc/en-gb/articles/207240845-What-is-a-perpetual-fallback-license-), which is something a lot of people don't know about.
I’d hope so - but I’ve seen some bullshit before. A buddy wanted a realestate data-processing webapp for $100... i was like, “this will take me at least a month of full time work, in part because I have to learn how to use the framework you want me to use and clean all the data...no”
Yeah, but as someone who only codes casually I am not ready to pay even 9 bucks a month. And I am fine with CE not being able to use a remote interpreter or not having some extra support for Django. It's just this particular feature would be really useful as I really like WSL but alas...

&gt; A buddy Yep, I've been in your shoes on more than one occasion. Most people have no clue what it takes to develop a project and figure that since *you're a computer whiz* that it's like typing up a paper or something. I almost lost a good friend the second time that I did a major project for him because we both felt like we got royally screwed (I charged him 1/3 of the price even, but yet *I was taking him to the cleaners because no one else would do the work.*). It definitely pays not do paid work for friends or family.
Failing at this facial recognition code Need help ;-; Heres the code - "https://realpython.com/face-recognition-with-python/"

It means for a typical small company. It's pretty easy to purchase a software licence. But going through the process to do a donation is a lot more involved. For example, if Django sold books, I'd buy one for every developer on my team. I mentioned that as the article started off by mentioning the potential lack of funding for Django.
What are it's advantages to say ZSH?
No, memory should not be saved where ever possible. Saving memory is usually just one of many competing priorities. Anyway, module imports are cached in the dictionary located at `sys.modules`. The amount of memory used is the same whatever. (Unless your function isn't getting called)
So if you can save the memory what is stopping you from doing it? And if the memory is in the stack though you would be saving memory.

Pycharm pro is free with a .edu email
irc it is more a question of good style. having your imports on top makes it more readable in the sense that let the code reader have an overview of what are the dependencies.
Please do. Also, why only a few redditors? Why not make a post on r/python when you make it open source, for all to see? Or maybe add one more line in the bot's reply linking the code?

The only memory being saved is the in scope reference to the time module. The actual time module is still held in memory, as you can see if you check sys.modules.
&gt; So if you can save the memory what is stopping you from doing it? For one, it's generally a bad style that makes it harder to read your program because it does not match commonly-used python styles. (There are occasional good times to violate this convention...optional dependencies, functions that are rarely called and that are importing seriously large modules) Anyway, wherever you import a module, it is stored in the global sys.modules dictionary.

I think you may be confusing Python with the IDE editor you use to write and test code. Best thing for you would be to take this whole problem over to r/learnpython. 
You need to put more effort into your question. Read it as someone who doesn't have the slightest clue what you're talking about and provide all the information. What's "this website"? CMU Academy looks like a college/university...what are you really asking? There is no type of python, there is just python and it is used in a large variety of ways. Furthermore, r/learnpython is more suitable for questions.
I like your idea of requiring a flair. I think that could help a lot!
It certainly feels like a large number are removed a day. And the automoderator catches many as well.
Looks similar to this website: [http://www.pythonsandbox.com/](http://www.pythonsandbox.com/) Perhaps this a CMU branded site that accesses the Python Sandbox.
Thank you! I updated the post with the new link. The source code was moved around a little and broke the link. Thanks for saying something.
&gt; So if you can save the memory what is stopping you from doing it? I might want to optimize for performance, instead. Let's say that module loading works the way you think (it doesn't, but let's imagine). Each time you call the method, memory is allocated to hold the time module, the module gets loaded, the method executes, and then the memory gets released. Then it needs to get garbage collected. Every. Time. Allocating and loading memory is expensive. So *arguably*, you're saving memory, but you are heavily impacting performance. Also, if this worked the way you think, it would also require the entire module to be loaded onto the stack, not in the heap, and that's a whole can of worms that we don't need to get sidetracked in, and there's a lot to keep in mind with how Python largely does heap allocation anyway since pretty much every variable is actually a reference, and we can also set *that* aside too. The key point is: many tasks boil down to a tradeoff between memory consumption and performance, and memory is usually cheaper than performance. The very premise of a caching system is built around the idea that you use more memory to boost performance. You could use less memory, but in general, the more memory you put in your cache, the more useful it is. 
Thanks this helps. I get what it is now. Thanks!
The entire point of python is to trade off speed and efficiency against ease of use and readability. If your margins are small enough that deferring import of a library significantly helps matters, you might want to consider another language.
I feel like trying to get that subreddit going will split this subreddit's content and users when as of right now, this subreddit should be about news and discussions.

I hope they fix the memory leak issue inspections get when they run on our code. The entire 2018 love has been a no-go for my team.
In an effort to make this easier, The upcoming pyglet v1.4 has support for easily setting 3D projection, and loading obj models (glTF coming soon). New codecs can be added at runtime. There is still a big lack of tooling, but once the basics are in place it would make it easier for someone to write tools. 
I disagree. He specifically stated that knowing the syntax inside and out isn't what you should aim for. What is important is recognizing when certain features are useful to solve a specific problem. You can then look up the syntax.
Cool!
More python specific than anything, but python struggles to import programs with dashes in their names. Here is a [7 year old thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7583652/python-module-with-a-dash-or-hyphen-in-its-name/24659400) with some hacks to get it done. Not sure if it has changed/improved since then. Generally though, using random special characters in places where no special characters are needed is going to get you into random trouble in many programming languages, just depends on the language, the specific context, and the special character.
I just uninstalled conda through control panel and then reinstalled. The same problem still persist. Do you know what's causing this?
So, I've been using a pro version now (with a yearly license) and have perpetual license for version 2018.2. If I do not continue my subscription I would not have the pro features of 2018.3 (WSL Interpreters), but what about free features/ improvements like Multiline TODOs or Improved Plugins repository. Can I upgrade to 2018.3 now and continue using free features even after the subscription expires. Or do I get locked out of the whole version 2018.3 and need to downgrade when the subscriptin lapses? (In which case I might just skip updating). Thanks. 
Do I still have 0 likes? Hmm... Maybe the motivation was not clear: "Under Linux, in a terminal, you can use 16 colors. However, most terminals support 256 different colors. You want to write a console application that uses some nice colors. If you find it difficult to pick colors from the 256 colors, then this GUI app. is for you. How to use it? Let's say you find a nice color on an image. Open it in Gimp and use its color picker tool to identify the color. However, Gimp will tell you the color's HTML hexa code, e.g. #ABCDEF. With this app. you can find the closest color from the 256 X11 colors, and then you can immediately use that color in your console application."
Downvoted for having absolutely nothing to do with Python, despite the dodgy attempt to use Python in the misleading subject.

I stand by my statement, this video only discusses one use case enforcing constraints with metaclasses and then he points out btw theres "collections.abc" which isn't the right library actually it's just from abc import ABCMeta. Collections.abc is where the implementations of ABCMeta are(Predefinded classes that enforce things). His Protocols, Generators, Context managers just go over the standard implementation that you can get from reading the docs or any book. I am not saying the video isn't useful if you don't like to read and want to watch a video of python stuff go for it. Just that it is not going to lead anyone to being an expert and doesn't describe the process of getting there. Framing problems properly with a language is what I see as expert level. Being able to solve a problem many different ways but picking one that is maintainable. But here are some examples of the type of problem I would have liked him to talk about. ``` # a property that caches the return value for expensive calls that return the same result def lazy_property(func): def ret_func(self): if hasattr(ret_func, "_lazy_property"): return ret_func._lazy_property value = func(self) setattr(ret_func, "_lazy_property", value) return value ret_func.__name__ = func.__name__ return property(ret_func) # a decorator that adds a lock around a function for thread safety def synchronized(func): lock = Lock() def new_func(*args, **kw): lock.acquire() try: return func(*args, **kw) finally: lock.release() return new_func # one that locks all the functions in a class def sync_class(cls): for k, v in vars(cls).items(): if not k.startswith("_") and inspect.isroutine(cls): setattr(cls, k, synchronized(v)) return cls Use case for metaclasses that isn't enforcing a constraint setting __getattr__ for the class In [13]: class HTTPClassType(type): ...: def __getattr__(cls, name): ...: if name in [ ...: "put", "copy", "post", "get", "head", "delete", "options", ...: "patch"]: ...: return partial(cls.request, name.upper()) ...: print("class gettattr") ...: raise AttributeError(name) ...: In [14]: In [14]: class Test(metaclass=HTTPClassType): ...: def __getattr__(self, name): ...: print("instance getattr") ...: raise AttributeError(name) ...: In [15]: In [15]: Test.asdf class gettattr --------------------------------------------------------------------------- AttributeError Traceback (most recent call last) &lt;ipython-input-15-8495351bb34c&gt; in &lt;module&gt; ----&gt; 1 Test.asdf &lt;ipython-input-13-e40380f2f6ac&gt; in __getattr__(cls, name) 6 return partial(cls.request, name.upper()) 7 print("class gettattr") ----&gt; 8 raise AttributeError(name) AttributeError: asdf In [16]: Test().asdf instance getattr --------------------------------------------------------------------------- AttributeError Traceback (most recent call last) &lt;ipython-input-16-15bd29d74d92&gt; in &lt;module&gt; ----&gt; 1 Test().asdf &lt;ipython-input-14-b29b9c0b1fd6&gt; in __getattr__(self, name) 2 def __getattr__(self, name): 3 print("instance getattr") ----&gt; 4 raise AttributeError(name) 5 AttributeError: asdf In [17]: ``` List of common problems I see solved in terrible ways all the time. Serializing objects and sending them to different processes to build apps that use multiprocessing. Splitting up an object that logically belongs as one object but it's not maintainable because of size. Like a client for an api with 500 different calls. Building an object that navigates a UI like android, where you could build out navigation for the main UI but it has 100s apps so it ends up a huge unorganized mess. How to make an extendable commandline util that can be debugged(I'm looking at you openstack). Writing a good shell executor using popen. Properly abstracting a big process(you can't do everything in one line even in python). 
But why? The real SFTP does it better...
In the future, good first steps to troubleshoot such problems are: 1. Look at the value of `sys.path` and see if directories you expect to be there are actually there, alternatively, that nothing you expect to be there is missing. 2. When package X fails to import package Y, but you think you installed Y, look at `X.__path__` to make sure you are importing X from the place you expect it to be.

Mauvaise image rien du tout, ça n’a pas de sens de prendre des petits bouts d’Histoire pour justifier un commentaire.

Donc répondre à quelqu’un qui fait un commentaire humoristique (certes douteux) en ramenant ça sur le tapis, ça me semble extrêmement déplacé...

Awesome :). I'm trying to work out how best to have these script GUIs deployed in a work environment and I am coming up with three distinct paths I could go down. My preference is to only go down one. Here are my options as I see them: * Create a JupyterHub server * Positives * Users can login, access them from anywhere in the centre * Python distribution is centrally managed * Applications are centrally managed * Negatives * Set up is not 'plug and play' * JupyterHub runs on Linux, paths will all display in Linux format by default which may confuse users * Create an Electron App viewer * Positives * Becomes a desktop app that is comfortable for users * Users can set \`.form.md\` files on their machine to open with this electron app * All data is local, simpler for users * Could be made to be plug and play * Could potentially provide a method for people to bundle forms and a Python distribution with the Electron App viewer making a little portable App framework * Negatives * No longer centralised * Need to have something on every device for it to work * Will no longer be able to target devices like phones for simple forms served over the intranet * Use pyodide and jyve ([https://github.com/deathbeds/jyve/pull/27](https://github.com/deathbeds/jyve/pull/27)) to make this completely web based * Positives * This would be serverless * Python would run within the users browser * Could be used to make static pages online for documentation etc * Negatives * Difficult to access local files * Difficult to save * Difficult to use networking libraries * Not many python libraries have been ported to wasm for use in pyodide yet Given your interest, by any chance would you have a preference out of the above options?

Still don't get how to keep working on their own style/formatters instead adding good support for 3rd party tools that you can update and configure on a per project basis and that then allows other developers to use the same configuration. &amp;#x200B; It's nice that they add more checkboxes on how to sort your imports, but isort has this all figured out already and has configuration that's part of your codebase.

Well, SFTP is FTP protocol, which uses SSH as transport protocol. FTP itself is very simple, here is its description: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc959 .

1. /r/learnpython 2. There's no functional difference between the two. The second is arguably better for readability in the general case, but in cases like Flask web apps, it's generally fine to import some functions directly into your namespace so you don't have to write long module names every time.

Came for the joke, stayed for the show, eh?
Thats how you build an audience 
I do not know this one way or the other off-hand, but does /r/learnpython or /r/python have more subscribers/posts/activity? I think the answer to this question would be an interesting signal to input into your algorithm for determining what the majority of people are looking for. My gut tells me that the majority of people coming to /r/Python are looking for help, not discussion. (Also it tells me there is probably significant overlap...aka, people looking for help also want discussion). It's my hypothesis that the amount of activity is highest around people looking for help and that /r/Python is the natural first place on reddit for people to look for that help.
Interestingly I learned about this feature this week as well when I tried creating an equivalent of `operator.attrgetter` for `setattr` using `functools.partial(setattr, name='name', value=value)` and failures led me to the same conclusion through `help(setattr)`. Does anyone happen to know if there's a way to provide _argument placeholders_ to `functool.partial` for functions with such positional-only signatures?

Too hard eh? Try rot13 then. Also /r/learnpython would be really helpful to you.
Firstly, do not call "import random" multiple times. The module only needs importing once. Secondly, the source of your error is that you are creating a variable named "random". This overrides the "random" module. Then, when you try to assign something to variable "random2", you call the method "randint" of the VARIABLE "random" (the module, which would have the method "randint", no longer exists) Change your variable "random"'s name to "random1" *I cannot test this since I don't have access to Python currently. Does it work?*

No, but it seems that you are installing flask in a different environment. List anaconda environments with `conda env list`, then choose the proper one and install all libraries you need. The best solution for you is watching/reading tutorials on virtualization though. You can also refer to conda's documentation and installation tutorial.

Transforming some user shopping data with Pandas.
Looks good. Might wanna create a GUI for it next.
No, that was not what was happening, I just installed flask on a virtual server at work and it messed up the anaconda installation, whilst it is just a new empty development server, it wasn't a big issue per se.
Why not use something jinja2 templating language? Then you can target web pages and local display. 
Matpolotlib had basemap but it's been deprecated afaik. It was also hard to use and hard to install
It's the only question he asked..
&gt; Ray has undergone treatment in the UK since his diagnosis in March. Unfortunately, the doctors there believed operating on Ray’s tumors would be too risky to attempt. Ray obtained a second opinion at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, TX, where they believe surgery is both possible and advisable. Here’s the catch: with immigration laws and health insurance policies, we can’t get Ray covered for his operation to happen at M.D. Anderson. To give Ray the best chance at surviving this, we want to pitch in and help him obtain the best care possible. TFW when you don’t even bother reading the plea for money before ignorantly trashing American healthcare. I mean, did you even read the link before posting this?
He has healthcare under UK’s NHS....
The reality is that nobody gets out of here alive. It is something liberals don’t understand, you have to take a very personal interest in your own life if you expect it to last. As for cancer we may eventually have viable solutions for the majority of cancer types. However these days most solutions for the various cancers are just a few steps away from treatement you would get in the dark ages. Sometimes it just isn’t worth it. 
So fucked up that he's attempting to get American healthcare, because the UK healthcare system is leaving him to die?
Thanks ^^
Does that change anything about my statement?
For the record, UK healthcare on cancer varies dramatically depending on the area (don’t ask), and anyway they are constantly trying to save money. US is at the other side of the spectrum, where they will do everything they can because they make money from it. Places like Italy, France or the Netherlands usually sit in between these extremes. Chances are that if he had taken a trip to the continent, instead of flying to the other side of the Atlantic, he wouldn’t have to pay.
Trying to figure out how to run a database on a shared drive in work so that multiple users can write and read from it. Something so simple seems a lot harder than I first thought.

What part are you referring to? Something benefitial here is being able to write python within markdown and have it make a live update GUI. The aim being to have a syntax that is quite readable and accessible by most users if need be. Isn't react a JavaScript framework library?
Thank you
I am a CS student and I organize a study group for my section each week. I was really annoyed at how difficult it was to reserve the on campus study rooms, so I wrote a script using selenium and twilio to reserve the rooms I want each week, the moment they become available. Then, it sends a text to my group with the details. Currently working on setting up a simple flask webapp, so people can choose turn on/off the text alerts and view the weekly schedule.

React uses Javascript mixed in with HTML. I suggested looking into React as a basis for how to integrate HTML into another language. 
I called for insurrection, but there's no need to smash all of Guido's statues now that the palace coup is complete.
Ahh sure. ScriptedForms is built on top of Angular and JupyterLab modules. So I guess your idea is what I'm already doing?
Obviously an issue with that PC.

Is your laptop running 32-bit Windows? If so you need to download the 32-bit version of Python. (It may also be called the x86 version).
Daddy 😩💦
Really great work!!
Those are lists, not arrays.
&gt;Guido: ... it was only when I went to university to study math that I found out that they had a computer and students were allowed to use it. &gt;Interviewer: and [mumble] you were supposed to talk to that computer by programming it [pause] How did that feel like finding [gets interrupted] &gt;Guido: that was the only thing you could do with it It's always interesting to hear Guido, but the interviewer questions were so bad. It feels like this person didn't watch a single interview with him and went in blind.
Is it open source? If not, you should consider putting it up on GitHub.
Do you not understand English well?
I Just put the source code on the site.
Please upload it on GitHub, if you’re planning to do anything serious with this project!
Great idea - will try to start using this method of organizing. Any chance you can do the snippets.py setup - I have a few snippets I find myself adding to nearly every notebook - would like to integrate into my flow.
I have a 64bit, I have tried both versions (just in case) and both of them didn't work
How does this differ from eg py2exe?

Very odd indeed. Have you tried running the installer from a command prompt? It might give you an error message at least. Failing that, consider trying the version of Python you can download from activestate.com - even if it's not really what you want it might throw an error message as well. 
r/learnpython
Cool project! I noticed you were using a C program for setup. You might want to look into Bash scripting or Makefile for creating setup scripts/rules. Otherwise, nice job :)
The way this interview went reminded me of the hedgehog and the fox distinction. The interviewer being the hedgehog trying to fit everything into a more black and white world view, and Guido being the fox and effortlessly at home in ambiguity, frustrating the hedgehogs attempts to discuss broad themes.

Which part are you having trouble with bud? I recently did facial detection using opencv as well :)
Thank you :).
Very nice interview. Very philosophical too at some points, mostly from the interviewer, but still, Guido went with it. I believe he enjoyed it. I liked it.
I feel Anaconda does not care enough matching only one to one. 
Will do! When I started off I though I would have a more complex setup program (control flow etc) and didn’t feel comfortable doing that in bash. I opted for c over python as making exes is less of a pain. In the future I will certainly look at Makefile. Thank you for the kind words 
No problem!
Sounds a lot like the old vs new python philosophies. To expand on that the old python was really strong on duck typing without, compared to all the type strictness or severe type hinting we see (or proposed) in the newer iterations on python.
Maybe r/cscareers could help

Jesus. Why open the interview with that question? You have to gain a rapport with the guest and the audience before dropping bombs. Turned it off after that. 
Hard to accept a mistake like this when MIT and Harvard is also mentioned in the ad.
Yep! While browsing more I saw a python ad from the same people and would you believe it used java haha
Just another one of the 3 billion devices running java.
Nah it's just Jython
This could be on purpose. If you know what the deal is, you’re not part of the target audience, and your clicks would not have value to them.
This stat makes my soul uncomfortable
Generic "software development" banner used as a background with varying slogans? 
No I didn't. Thank you for explaining.
Good thinking, although I'm assuming they're running ads on the course page and odds are they value revenue over skewed traffic data
Actually a port of Python to the JVM. Kinda neat! No 3.x tho.
It's an implementation of Python. The standard version is written in C, but you can use Jython (written in Java) instead. AFAIK you can use Java classes with it and some standard Java libraries, though I never worked with it so I can't tell you what it's actually like.

Wish the reddit questions were given more time. I'm sad that [my functional programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9sj6xy/questions_for_guido_van_rossum/e8pf4js/) ones never got discussed. ;_;
See, this is what I do not understand. I also write nodejs and javascript but when I'm expected to do so I follow the rules of that language. It's like grammar to me. Why don't people understand this? You come to a language don't bring another language's syntax or standards into it. It just confuses people. 
It's cool mate!
I wonder if there is a possibility to run the same tests for both mocked and real API. Periodical running “real” API tests allows to make sure that our assumptions about the external API are still valid.
Found it. There are a couple of ways to do so, the simplest one seems is to create regular TestCase of external tests without VCR.py, and then subclass it with adding VCRTestCase as a parent class. Have not tested this yet, though 
And yet, some folks get sore if someone asks a python syntax question in this subreddit...
What the ad is for, edx, is really good though
First, let me say I think that the comparison to the stackoverflow community is apt. I’m a newbie coming from to this group with a background in chemistry, I initially went to stackoverflow to find answers and the community felt totally unwelcoming so I came here - such a nice change. From my perspective I think joining this subreddit with the learn python would make some sense and then make a more advanced python group as well. The only conundrum is does that mean the new merged group would receive less traffic because adv. users would skip over it? What is the traffic like over at learn python? What is the response rate like when questions are posted? If users stop answering questions here are they are likely to migrate over to the advanced thread as well? Just some thoughts from another coding newb...
There are ads on Reddit?
May I recommend you “invoke” as a Python alternative for “make” and “setup.c”? http://www.pyinvoke.org/
The two are extremely similar because they are both thin wrappers around the Qt API. 
So why would one choose one versus the other?
r/crappydesign
I see. I just remembered how poorly you have treated helpful redditors in the past and I lost all interest in helping you. https://snew.github.io/r/learnprogramming/comments/8ulojw/hex_editors_with_realtime_image_viewing/ https://snew.github.io/r/learnprogramming/comments/8uq5j3/hex_edit_images_realtime_viewer/ 
No idea what you're talking, and I don't even know you, and I think you'll find it's those people who treated me badly by giving poor answers.
Ok great thanks!

Just to add to this, you can just type "python" in your terminal to get an interactive prompt.
Well the issue here is he used twisted as a core part of the entire system (which I'm changing) and he followed their style. Twisted doesn't follow pep8 at all really. 
/r/learnpython 
&gt;because the UK healthcare system is leaving him to die? At least its *free*, right? Free Healthcare folks, its like magic...
I don't think the one making the ads know it, they just took some stock photos or something that looks a little bit good
Post your code samples with formatting, please. Your examples are not syntactically correct and it's hard to tell if it's because there's a syntax error or because Reddit did bad things to it.

Not sure how I managed to miss that... fixed now. Thanks for flagging it
Have a look at IPython: [https://ipython.org/](https://ipython.org/)
If you already have existing CLI scripts parsing args, take a look at Gooey, it does literally white only take a few lines to make a functional gui for basic programs : https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey
How do i run the code when it has all the files on github like installation of open cv was fine but idk whats next 
Yes, That is the another way to get list of dictionary keys.

I've been working on an easy to use Python library that lets you write less code to do more things and it on GitHub [here](https://richienb.github.io/quilt).
Wow. I read your comment before watching, and expected the first question might be something relevant but insulting, e.g. "Why do you think so many Python programmers are moving to Go?" Instead it was much worse. I feel like this guy would interview a local politician and open with "What are your thoughts on the Curry–Howard isomorphism?"
I was out with my girlfriend waiting on an errand to finish at a place, so we went walking around the nearby shops at the little strip mall thing. My girlfriend has T-Mobile as her phone provider. There was a T-Mobile store nearby, but they had a sign hanging over their door that was hung upside down. Since we had nothing better to do, she went in to kindly inform the manager that the sign was upside down. When she came back out, I asked what they said. She told me the manager said they hung it upside down on purpose to get people into their store so they could talk to them about signing up. They didn't have anything to impress on her since she already had a plan, but I thought it was genius. This could be similar, or it could be a graphic designer who didn't know better. Either one.
I'd look into renaming. [Quilt](http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt) is an existing tool that's used extensively in Debian, OpenWRT and lots of other places.
Didn't look very deep into it, but I'm just wondering - why would one want to install your package and ``` import quilt_lang quilt_lang.absolutenum(-1) quilt_lang.absolutedir('.') ``` instead of just using the stdlib? ``` import os abs(-1) os.path.abspath('.') ```
Exactly. Those are List.
First two I can think about: - Licence model: PyQt has no LGPL option, - Maturity/longevity: PyQt may be more mature currently, but with a smaller company behind
I hear a lot of negatives about them, people saying they’re a waste of time - but I’ll probably end up doing them simply because it’s another qualification under my belt, if you have the opportunity to do them, why not?
It means they wanted people to be able to read it 
That's clever
Unless a job requests it, I would not bother. If they want to pay for it, then by all means. My experience has been that people/companies only care about projects. Do some projects that sound amazing, document them, and then tell people. The other thing they respond to is passion.
Yeah but you often only pay when someone clicks on your ad. So this could actually make sense to reduce the costs for the ad a bit.
Interviewer : narrow intelligence Guido : general intelligence
That's not nice.
How did you download it? It’s not as easy as just copy and pasting everything from GitHub, you’re going to need to download some dependencies
Numpy right?
While in a terminal, type python3 (or python if you’re not using python3) after that type, import cv2 and hit enter. Lemme know what happens after that
Gooey is a very nice tool. :).
Thanks! That seems much easier to learn

Look into web frameworks like Flask.
I really appreciate your feedback and I will be working to fix this.
Thanks again but my problem is the logic on how to slove the current captcha but from different ip computer! 
Here's the thing: it might ease development _for you_, because you're already familiar with the library, since -- well -- you wrote it, but it does not ease development _for other people_, because when they run into code that uses your library, they have to figure out how your library works, instead of relying on their most likely already existing, and much more universal, knowledge of the standard library.
Well, you'll need to extract the captcha and present it to the user on another computer, then capture the response and forward it to the server.
Honestly? Just throw it out and start from scratch. Figure out what you want your library to be _about_ - "grab bag of convenience functions" is a nice approach in languages like JavaScript that don't have them built in, but in Python most of this stuff is in the standard library, so pick a thing that's not in the standard library, or maybe is in the standard library but could be improved, and focus on building that one thing.
I can get the site_key etc of the targeted domain-captcha but when i use them on a php script i got domain error !! Somehow must must bypass domain check ..!! This “present to the user is my problem” Thanks for your time !

I've recently been sick, so while I'm off work for the next few week I decided to learn python properly. I'm statistician so I very conformable with R. To jump start the process I decided to code up from scratch a few ways of fitting logistic regression models. Once that is done I'm going to try and port some of my old R code that I used to solve a couple of pet projects (simulating battles in the Risk board game, hang man etc, etc).

People always talk about marketing using the 'Nigerian prince strategy' . Aka, intentionally This is the stupidest argument I've ever heard, makes absolutely no sense (why would you intentionally limit your target audience--saying because it targets only stupid people is absolutely asinine and stupid) and the worst thing is that people continue to parrot it as if it's some science and not just bullshit that one person said one time and made a bunch of suckers believe him. The argument is that typos (or in this case, erroneous images) are intentional and will automatically weed out "smart people" so that the stupid people will be clearly visible. Please tell me how this makes sense in practice--if anything, it only raises the chances that the stupid people will actually see the mistake and back out. Adding "intentional errors" will NEVER help you out, it will only hurt you. Please, someone try to actually substantiate the 'Nigerian prince' strategy. Otherwise, stop fucking pretending like it's real and not just a fuckup made by literal Nigerian scammers who don't know how to spell.
True
Nice! Thanks!
It might technically be Python, but it's written in the style of Java...
You’re not the only one... It happens 
I ended up reposting this since last night I realized I was talking about lists and not arrays (my old Ruby brain is mixing the two up, even tough they are different in Python) and had to change the post to reflect that. Then I wanted to update title in reddit and that did not work so here we are :) 
It's why we have verbose errors :D
It's case to say that they don't know to differentiate Java from Python. But most probable is that the guy who did the montage had no idea what he was doing, neither it was reviewed before being posted. Shame

Hey Richie, A lot of programmers create things like this early on in their programming careers - basically wrapping existing functionality with your own function names that seem easier to understand. As you program more you'll find that you understand "raise RuntimeError(msg)" just as quickly and easily as "quilt_lang.throwerror()" and with the benefit that other developers can understand it too. So this is probably not very useful for most programmers, and over time it will stop being very useful for you as well, but I want you to be encouraged that this is a normal part of developing as a programmer. It's part of abstractly understanding a language - the part of your brain that stores what the language actually does and will eventually be the part that tells you that print and cout and console.log and whatever else all do roughly equivalent things when you learn different languages is what you're writing out here. Good luck and keep going with Python!
Why not use GNU Octave? It's a matlab clone free to use https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/ 
I definitely wouldn’t be paying to do them, my point was - if you are provided with the opportunity to do them, then go ahead. 
The return type should be based on if you want the data to be mutable or immutable. If you want mutable data, return the list. If you want immutable data, return a tuple of the list.

yeah but this is edX
What's with all the blockchain spam recently?
Code completion engines is good example of usage. Majority of modern text editors support language server protocol or at least plug-ins. This allows relatively easy to impliment code completion for your favourite editor. For example, neovim provides Python client to its MsgPack RPC plugin protocol. So, there is everything to build code completion engine for SQL.
Sounds complicated but I just decided to learn on a whim so I don’t know a lot about computer science in general, just the basics. Problem is, I don’t really _need_ anything from coding since I’m still a student. Maybe I could think of a project that I want to make that’s relevant to my interests, but I don’t know what the capabilities of python are.
Not to mention his tone was extremely condescending. 2 mins in you can tell this guy thinks he is a walking god of Python.
It's edX, an established educational platform with a decent reputation and considerable ties to esteemed institutions.
Well imo, the best way to get started is think of a reason you want to learn code. Im using python because it's a very common language for robotics and is great for data analysis. Another thing is just try and automate something maybe tedious to you otherwise. Like i download alot of music from YouTube so i learned how to make a web scraper (goes through websites, collects html information) and downloads the music for me.

The reason I want to learn code is mostly just for general interest at this point. I’m also wanting to go into a physical science career, so coding for data analysis and the ability to write programs to help research could be really important or helpful. But I think I’ll have to read some more tutorials and make some more really basic code before I’ll be able to wrap my brain around something like a web scraper.

You could use the standard library to write your own implementation, but otherwise, I highly doubt it. I don't think the standard library has image support. Looks like jpeg compression was supported in python 2, but I think you'll need something like imagemagick, pil, or something else
With the caveat that Octave doesn't implement everything that MATLAB can do, and some parts are implemented in a different way. I got bitten already by numeric instability of some of Octave's algorithms.
Marketers don't know shit about programming, why is this a surprise?

Automate the boring stuff with Python course is 10$ on udemy right now. I went through this course after taking edx course Harvard’s Fundamentals of Computer Science and have a much better grasp of what can be done. Best of luck!
Thanks! Someone linked me to automate the boring stuff, that definitely looks like a really broad tutorial that’d be super helpful. Is the Harvard’s fundamentals of CS course free online?
This seems to be a basic problem adressed by millions of researchers and practioners... can you use a Standard Database management system?
Trying to convince my daughter that learning Python is fun.
Sounds interesting..
Yep! Free!
Hey, I think I can afford that :)
Hey checkout jupyter: https://jupyter.org/ You can use it with Python and it lets you work with notebooks (similar to wolfram Mathematica). I have used it and it is way better than Matlab. 
I am losing speed! I have been focussed at creating daily journal for learning python, but it's just that I don't know what to write in that journal anymore. I started with learning about internal working and reading different blogs. Basically, I was lot motivated because I love looking at new programs. But after a month of doing it daily; I kind of am not able to find out new blogs about interesting things. I started checking out Wikipedia and Rosetta code for program ideas, and trying to continue working. My notes are here [https://github.com/kuroop/python-notes](https://github.com/kuroop/python-notes), if anyone wishes to check. But mostly they are programs without explanations.
Harvard maintain an image to people who have never been, which is that they're the best of the best. Seems that's just a facade. That's the reason why it surprised me; they made me expect more. Also good point about outsourcing, you're probably correct.
Lex here (interviewer). Criticism taken. I was very well prepared, but it may have not sounded like it. You're watching an introverted scientist learning (and failing often) how to have a passionate, interesting, flowing conversation. I'm learning and improving. Thanks for coming along for the journey.
I like the idea. Will definitely check. That got me thinking, what can make a TODO tool more effective? What can actually help user to finish the tasks? What are things you are doing different in your tool ?
Python is a great choice for you. Automate the boring stuff is very 'general' start. I started with that book in 2015 and now work full time doing data analysis stuff and some application development. 
&gt; graphic designer who didn't know better More likely that.
All the best :)!
For people who advocate for flexible / dynamic typing you lot sure are rigid when it comes to type checking acceptable redit topics. Sorry... couldn't help my self :-)

You expect the front end designer to tell the difference between Python and Java?
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar.
Add a named parameter that allows you to change behavior, with the most common case as the default. i.e. def get_data(self, as_copy=False): list = [1,2,3] if as_copy: return list[:] else: return list
Is there a reason that you've used Flask? Just curious as it doesn't seem to be needed to achieve the emailing. If you wanted to use Flask a bit more you could have someone enter their email on a webpage to get it sent to them.
I see thanks for the input :) 
No, but I feel as though, what with the code being the entire point of the course, someone should probably have told them. Do they want their potential customers thinking they don't know the difference between java and python?
I'm working on a **Pomodoro** application. The text to speech module I'm using is horrible. Adding vlc module to improve sound potential. I'll also explore other text to speech modules.
Hey, I am not being critical but being jokingly mocking to front end designers. You are on point.
To be honest I wanted to this send links as sms to my phone I was using simple smtplib and mime modules but it wasn’t working the way I wanted but now it works perfectly fine and but some how it cannot send links to phone since. I am using html template

Even they admit, "Look, you're gonna move to Python anyways. Join this course to get interested, then eventually decide to switch to Python.'
You can pass a url to the VideoCapture method, you can even include a username and password if needed. I used VLC to test the URL. You can also use cv2 to convert the stream into a web friendly format like jpg. And to take it a step further you could use Flask to create a webpage of the converted camera stream. import cv2 cap = cv2.VideoCapture("rtsp://user:pass@192.168.1.2:8080/out.h264") while(cap.isOpened()): ret, frame = cap.read() frame = cv2.imencode('.jpg', frame).tobytes() yield (b'--frame\r\n' b'Content-Type: image/jpeg\r\n\r\n' + frame + b'\r\n\r\n') 
I didn't think python has a GC, the VM uses reference counting to clean up unused objects. 
I wonder how long it will be to get venv in WSL. That is a bit of a bummer.
It's an ad, you need to show beautiful things, not the real ones. Joking, Java has paid so many bills for me in the past, I owe it a lot.
It means that Python is using C or C++ implementation under the hood for most actual computations. Python is used to "describe" what your program should do. &amp;#x200B; Simply put, most built-in things in python are actually C
Sounds really cool, I doubt I can help much but I will try since it seems like a really interesting project. 
Simplifying a bit, but: The `heavy lifting`, which means all the expensive matrix calculations and so on, are implemented in C/C++. If you write your NN/ML algorithms in Python, you actually only create a description of what calculations you want to have performed. When you run the model, the Python code itself is only used to create a graph of the calculations-to-be-performed, which is then handed down to lower-level languages to actually execute it. What does that mean? Basically nothing. Pandas and Numpy also use C/C++/others under the hood to improve the performance of complex calculations. CPython (which you are probably using) itself is also written in, you guessed it, C. And in the end, it doesn't really matter what code you write, it's executed as machine code on the CPU. In the same way C is easier to write than assembly, Python is easier to write than C. Sure, you could call Python a scripting or templating language for C without being technically completely wrong, but that does doesn't really mean anything.
Yeah, it's THAT important. :D
Hey that’s really neat! Thanks 
Looks nice. Never heard of it... Thanks for your hint!
Adding one more point to what others have already posted: Consider the principle of the _least surprise_. Don't have some functions return mutable things that change the state of the hypertable and other functions that return copies. Pick one approach and stay consistent. Think about how other people (even if you work alone) would like to use this hypertable, and what they would assume happens when they do something with it. Personally, I'd generally advocate against returning copies. If you want users to modify the data directly, just return it. If you want users to modify the table indirectly via other manipulation functions or APIs, then return a non-modifiable representation of the data instead (ex. Tuple since Python has no FrozenList). If a user then tries to change the data, he will immediately get an exception and be notified of his mistake. By returning a copy, someone might make changes to it and expect them to be available in the hypertable, which will quickly become a very unpleasant bug to find.
You too bud!
that's a very interesting way of looking at it. Perhaps I should work with that and declare very specific copy functions if that is what you want. I makes less sense to have copies be your default option now that I think about how I usually use objects 
PySide2 is the officially supported version. I've been able to convert most features from PyQt5 to PySide2 by simply changing the import statements. I have found a couple of features that did not work if I try to go from PySide2 to PyQt5 (no titlebar option and keep on top option). I have not yet investigated how to implement them using PyQt5. For OpenSource projects, PySide2 is the way to go going forward (in my opinion)
I recommend Jupyter Notebook.
Will it work in conjunction with PyCharm? 
Yeah, that's a bit weird in Python. Languages with Pointers let you more easily differentiate between "return a reference to the underlying data" and "returning a copy of the data". But since Python has no Pointers, you'll have to implement your own constraints. I'd maybe take a step back from "what should I return" and think about "what's the benefit of using the hypertable over using the raw data directly?" and "what is the abstraction/encapsulation that I want to provide to users?". You could also ask some more provocative questions: If you expect your users to regularly directly access the underlying data for reading and writing, why even use the Hypertable at all? Maybe users could just use normal lists and you just need to provide a few utility functions to perform commonly used actions? Maybe the Hypertable is not the correct abstraction for the problem you're trying to solve? I don't think that's the case for your code, but that's how I'd approach architectural decisions or abstractions I want to build.
`import gc` &amp;#x200B; `gc.disable()` `def allocate(num=1_000_000):` `lst = list()` `for i in range(0, num):` `temp = list()` `temp.append(lst)` `lst.append(temp)` `gc.collect()` &amp;#x200B; I'd try something like that. It'll create a bunch of lists and reference themselves (so the reference counter doesn't free them). I don't know of any other option for controlling the GC timing other than the gc module.
i totally get where you are coming from. in this case i made the class because it would clean up my code but i didnt want to use existing classes because it had to be as lightweight as possible. not robust and flexible but fast. You probably had this somewhere. tables of data with columns but now you want a collums and now a row. now a specific selection, now a transpose, you want to remember collums names but also not manage separate lists etc. but given the data sizes, it had to be fast too. I used the Astropy table before but it slowed down my code like 100 times, it was insane. in my case i now always return pointers unless i return specific slices (these rows from these columns) since i cant really return the pointers there

Am I the only one that tried to upvote both of the posts in the picture
What is this called? Is this valid python code? Where dan I learn more about that code structure?
So why aren't you?
It's valid. Reddit reformatted it, putting it all on a single line, but it's still valid. https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html
i wanted to just call it table but i work on heavily protected computers due to state secrets etc. My crappy IDE doesn't have refactoring and I already had a Table class that I wanted to redesign due to me discovering my class structure was shit. 
The database is for storing key performance indexes so that we can access and track variations with respect to processing conditions. Currently at most 4-5 people would be accessing the database, both read &amp; write. I'm having trouble finding what database engine to use as I'd preferably want it to be a database stored on the drive as a file, which won't get corrupted/fucked by multiple users possibly reading or writing to it at the same time. The shared drive is a mapped network drive run by an external IT company. I have no real idea about networking so I don't know how that works or if it will impact this project. I just know that it shows up in the file browser when we are connected to the company network. From my knowledge it is pretty much magic. I initially looked into a MySQL database at the brief recommendation from a colleague, but quickly realised it requires overly complicated things like server-clients etc. which really isn't on the cards as I won't have a dedicated machine to run it from. I've stumbled around and currently think SQL-lite might be what I need but I'm still wrapping my head around requirements and what is reasonable. Any alternatives for a simple database library or API that seems to fit, I'd be very happy to receive suggestions/pointers.
I'm running Anaconda with PySide2 and PyQt5 both installed. I'm not using any of the Anaconda features however. &amp;#x200B;
Stack Overflow has muddied my waters a bit. I *think* sql-lite is what I need, but I honestly didn't understand that corruption of the database can be a real problem (e.g. from multiple users writing to it concurrently). [This question is what gave me pause.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/788517/sqlite-over-a-network-share) Any constructive tips would be much appreciated. 
Coming a bit late with an answer but since no one mentioned it and you know R you should definitely take a look at the [`statsmodels`](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) package. It provides a formula interface similar to R (e.g. `y ~ x1 + log(x2)`) and provides a lot of goodies for statistical analysis like factor tables, hypothesis testing and time series models.
Ah, no, I typed in this: pip install pyside2 Just 1 install. 
Jumping into this a bit too late, but I still want to leave a few points since you haven't gotten any good answers yet. 1. There is no good way to quantify "level of competency" without actually seeing your work. 2. Depending on what you code, the hard skill requirements may be completely different. If you want to work as web-dev, you might also need to know/learn JavaScript (if you're applying for full stack positions), the entire data science stack (advanced maths/statistics, neural networks, ...) or you could be fine with just Python (ex. for microservice backends/REST APIs). 3. Programming language is not the only important tech hard skill. Depending on the position, understanding of networking, system administration, HTML/CSS/JS and SQL/Databases, as well as related tooling skills (Continuous Integration/Deployment, Git, Testing, ...) could also be an important part of the job. Those are much easier to learn though, and you'll typically learn at least the basics of them while learning programming. The basics are typically enough for the average developer. 4. Hard skills are not the only important things - soft skills like communicating well and structured thinking are often more important than having outstanding hard skills. Even in a pure programming job, you'll write much less code than you'd expect right now. Most of your time will be spent thinking about problems and potential solutions and then discussing that with others. 5. Companies can differ wildly in hiring. Some companies expect you to have 10 years of experience in a 5-year-old language, others focus much more on potential. We've hired people with almost no programming experience because they demonstrated that they were both willing and capable to learn it rather quickly. 6. Not all roles in tech teams require you to be a hardcore coder. Many companies/teams need people to do the project management/product owner tasks. This is a role that works very closely with developers, and having someone that at least has a basic level of coding experience is typically a big plus. You can look into learning things like Agile/Scrum (for the "cool" young companies) or ITIL (for corporate settings) if you want to go that way. I'd recommend you don't worry about when to start applying, and just do it. Be completely open with your current level of skills right from the start, demonstrate your willingness to learn and work hard, and go from there. In the worst case, you'll get rejected and can ask questions like "what skills would I have needed to get an offer?". The interview practice and the responses you get will help you much more than any coding exercise can. And if you re-apply some months later after self-teaching yourself those skills, that's a really good way to make a good impression ;) 
Maybe I'm stating the obvious here, but: Have you looked at Pandas already? Its DataFrame is basically the standard for high-performance tables in Python. Unless you do a lot of the heavy lifting in C/C++ and HyperTable is just a Python binding for that, Pandas will probably outperform anything you could develop yourself by a huge margin.
i have not. thanks. Ill see if this suits my needs

That would be a complicated way to do it, best way is to use pip. In an ideal world you would use virtualenv/pipenv, but requests is enough of a common-use module that it doesn't hurt to add it to your main Python environment. It' a 2-step process: First, install pip (if you didn't already install it together with Python). There is a pretty good guide on \[[https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)\]. Instructions are for Linux, except for downloading the install, process is exactly the same under Windows. script but Then, run `pip install requests` or `python -m pip install requests`.
Check out /r/learnpython for questions
Though I understand the problem, but with the constraints mentioned ; even I feel and with less resource investment, your best bet is SQL-lite. [This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4060772/sqlite-concurrent-access) is relevant; But what i guess is it still might cause corruption of files in case of network failures if operations are not atomic on the network drive.

What the fuck is even a blockchain and why are they used for everything these days
Thanks. 
I agree that it's probably "temps" for "temperatures", but for the sake of legibility it would be better to spell it all out. For example, I wouldn't have known that this has anything to do with 3D printing because I have zero experience with thermocouples. Further to the point, many other comments in this thread assume this is simply for reading temperature.
Thanks. I'm probably going to implement SQL-lite and test it a bit. From what else I've gleaned, the locking failure shouldn't really be an issue that is statistically going to happen that often even if I tried to make it happen. Hopefully between statistics and weekly backups, it shouldn't be a problem.
Oh and if I could go back and do it again I’d do the automate the boring stuff lessons first. Then do the EDX course and try to solve the problems they present (they want you to solve them using C) using Python.
That's the video I needed! Only problem Python won't run on Anaconda on my computer. I spent hours trying to fix it but it seems it's a problem many have. As far as I can understand some computers will always give the same error message. So I had to use PyCharm. How different the set up would be with PyCharm? 
Don't worry OP I am coming out of the exact same thing. However the more I study python and understand it the less I feel the need to "wrap it" to make it easier to use.

I bet they have multiple courses and just use the same background design for all of them.
Don't bother calling the gc module. It'll just do it for you. Just don't make circular references or it can't clean things up, unless you use a weakref.
Not saying i agree or disagree with anything you say. The benefit is when you have limited capacity to process reactions. So say you are a nigerian prince and you have only so much time for your activities and the people that react on your ad are far more than you can realistically bait. In that case it is about the ratio of stupid vs smart people and you do indeed have an incentive to only attract stupid people.

After Berkley endorsed water seer (an anti-scientific scam), I would not get amused by anything of the sort. Organizations are too big for their own good. There are so many layers between the clever eggheads and the publicity people that eggheads are actually not involved a lot of time. 
My bad! 
There needs to be a compilation of HD python wallpapers.
This looks beautiful 
Been looking for a better wallpaper. This is awesome! Thanks for the share
Thanks. Gonna put this on my desktop wallpaper
Nice! Thanks for sharing 
Hey, I'll assume it's python3, but anyway you usually want things the other way around, retrieve the the value using the key. It would simply be \`dictionary\[givenKey\]\` But here you want the key given the value so you will have to iterate over the pairs: \`\`\` for pair in dictionary.items(): if pair\[-1\] == givenValue: return pair\[0\] \`\`\` The one liner using comprehension list would then be: \`\`\` \[pair for pair in dictionary.items() if pair\[-1\] == givenValue\]\[0\]\[0\] \`\`\` But please, keep in mind it's not a good way to proceed.
This would fit /r/learnpython better, but I don't think dictionary is intended to be used that way. One way (I wouldn't recommend using this) to fetch key of current value when iterating trough values of dictionary is this: dictionary = {("a", 1): "foo", ("b", 2): "bar"} for val in dictionary.values(): print(list(dictionary.keys())[list(dictionary.values()).index(val)]) 
Thanks!! I’ll try it out

Thanks! We need a mobile version :)
Thanks bro
Please note the following line: del(years_of_experience[1]) Should be: del years_of_experience[1] `del` is a keyword not a function, magic is happening here and douldn't be obfuscated.

I have no idea but this sounds like a cool project. Please share results and code when you’re done!
What version of Python are you on?
Was on 3.7.0 before installing tensorflow. That forces you to downgrade to 3.6.7. I presume that's what tensorflow needs 
&gt;num=1_000_000 Holy shit, you can use underscores in the literal notation for ints and floats? That's amazing, love it
Why are you using pips propriotary clone anaconda? 
Because it was for a class in college and that's the way it was done there. Would that be a problem doing it this way? 
Source images. Don't just steal them and post them.
My experience with it made me bias, but it just felt like a corporate tool companies buy in bulk for their devs thinking it'll boost productivity when really it's clunky. Anyway, are you working on windows i imagine? If so hopefully windows 10? Please setup your WSL. Even on the windows 10 home edition it's substantial. It's like a built in docker compose environment for development on an ubuntu server. On it you should ok to install tensorflow core and karas. Just follow the website's main instructions.
Thanks, yeah I'm on windows 10 education. I'll look into setting that up tomorrow so.

One issue with PySide2 is the use of some of their specialty libraries like their graphing library that does not have an LGPL option. That leaves you in the same place as PyQT if you need those libraries... And the commercial license for PyQT is cheaper if your project is not open source.

Increased threading performance in my portscan module from 250 to 2000 threads : [https://github.com/Aperocky/PortScan](https://github.com/Aperocky/PortScan) Apparently Apple secretly placed a hard cap on RLIMIT\_NOFILE that are kernel based and probably doesn't even have available API for changes.

I don't think I ever needed to import the typing module dynamically.
Pretty cool, thanks!
You waited until you were called out by a half dozen people before crediting a source. Whether it's a watermark or something else that was removed, a) it's poor ettiquite to do so without explicit permission from the artist and b) you always should at least credit the source. I've uploaded many photographs I've taken semi-professionally in the past, only to find various other websites steal them, crop them, edit them, and use them without any credit to me.
"trying to give people something" that you put zero effort into? Or do you call googling and cropping effort? It happens all the time that people crop out sources and copyrights because they think they're ugly. But at least give credit to the source then.
If someone's looking for a quick video case study on generators, here's one from my course (this video is free so I'm pretty sure I can paste it here): https://recluze.teachable.com/courses/beyond-basic-programming-intermediate-python/lectures/6096396 
Wat?! This will be faster and way easier. ``` a = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] c = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8] from heapq import merge for i in merge(a, c): print(i) ```
What you're describing is just literally how a generator works isn't it? I understand how they function. I didn't think that my ```getThing``` function was technically a generator because I'm just iterating over a generator in the function so although it functions similarly to a generator (Because of the act it returns a single value) is isn't one. That's how I currently understand it anyway.
Nice
In my implementation I don't have access to lists, only generators so I can't implement that. Thanks for that though, I didn't know it was so easy to merge lists.
Your solution, while working, is somewhat inefficient, because you sort the entire `itemList` every time you append something - if you're going to do that anyway, you might as well just say `itemList = a + b; itemList.sort()`. But the input lists are already sorted, so you want to make use of that fact. It's strange how involved this is in Python. In Haskell, I'd do: mergeSorted [] xs = xs mergeSorted xs [] = xs mergeSorted (x:xs) (y:ys) | x &lt;= y = x : mergeSorted xs (y:ys) | otherwise = y : mergeSorted (x:xs) ys a = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] b = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8] print (mergeSorted a b) And because Haskell lists are essentially generators already, this does the trick, efficiently and in constant space. So how can we port this approach to Python? One problem is that unlike with Haskell's lists, we cannot "peek" at a generator - snatching off the first element is a destructive operation, so by just wanting to look at the first element, we already commit to consuming it. Not good. One thing we can do is provide a "lookahead" wrapper for iterators, something like: class Lookahead: def __init__(self, iterable): self.iterable = iterable self.current = iterable.next() def peek(self): return self.current def pop(self): result = self.current self.current = self.iterator.next() return result And now we can write this mergeSorted function: def merge_sorted(a, b): itemList = [] while (a.peek() is not None and b.peek() is not None): if a.peek() &lt;= b.peek(): itemList.append(a.pop()) else: itemList.append(b.pop()) return itemList Or we can even make it return an iterator by using yield instead of appending to a list: def merge_sorted(a, b): while (a.peek() is not None and b.peek() is not None): if a.peek() &lt;= b.peek(): yield a.pop() else: yield b.pop() And what do you know, it's almost as short and concise as the Haskell version (not counting the wrapper class and the overhead of transforming lists into generators though).
The other option is that I sort after all items from the generators have been appended, which is actually what I had initially. I'm not sure why I changed it actually. In my actual implementation I only have access to the generators not lists so I can't actually do that. I understand your wrapper class and function, but I don't really see what the benefit of it over my code is. It seems to do the same thing. Something I also forgot to mention which is rather important is that in my implementation I need to be able to access the output list at any time which is one reason I need to constantly sort the list.
True, having a link would be helpful
it works with any iterable
Wow that is super simple. Thanks :)
No problem, I missed a similar question in an interview once and after I found out about heapq I was kicking myself. 30min on a whiteboard
Most people seem to forget #1 reddiquette; remember the human. If OP really wanted to steal it, he would claim it as his own and glorify himself upon the art he did not create. People do make mistakes. 
I have had this opinion for a long time that it's easier to program libraries in low level, bare metal languages like C/C++/Rust, than making full-blown applications. The notion that you can program libraries in the lower levels and have an interface blown up to a higher level, to Python/bash/ruby/JS etc. is the most important parts of computer science. Building applications is easier because of this very fact. All the hard work is already done for you at the lower levels, so all you as a programmer need to do is glue all these pieces together to make something meaningful out of, say `np.linspace()`.
So you're admitting that you modified original work? I've looked over the dribbble site and can't see that the artist attached any kind of license to it. Which makes this what? Copyrighted? I'm a bit flaky in that area. In any case /u/moekakiryu is correct. You should at least have credited the creator.
Exactly. If the author did not give explicit consent it's automatically copyrighted as far as I remember. That's also why it's so important to attach a license to any code you open-source. Without giving written consent (easiest by using an existing open-source license) it's unusable if you want to be legally correct.
Stop giving op so much flak . It was out of good intent.
It's our (mirumee.com) work. I appreciate trying to contribute but it would be easier and more legal to reach out and ask for a wallpaper version.
A cracked version of PyCharm would be an asshole move even if your intent is to benefit the community. It’s interesting that you continue to defend your intent without admitting your actions. 
[The image owner](https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9zts0m/_/eacnk36/?context=1) seems to dispute your claim that you reached out. I think I’ll take their word over yours. 
I wouldn't point anybody to /r/learnpython as too many answers I've seen there are poor or downright wrong, and telling the fucking idiots who've posted the crap that they're fucking idiots gets you banned :-(
They may very well be the copyright holder. 
Well really all I want is to be able to get tensorflow and keras working with python so I can put together a jupyter notebook for a basic neural network.

Haha thanks. Yeah I did and it doesn't seem like any had this problem. Cheers anyway. I'll give your steps a go and see how far I get. 
&gt; I didn't think that my getThing function was technically a generator It's not, but it's also not really doing much - the for loop is redundant, because it returns after the first item. That means the whole thing is effectively equivalent to: def getThing(generator): return next(generator, None) In which case, you may as well just use the next() function directly. In fact, you should probably use it without the default value too (ie. just next(generator)) which will throw a StopIteration exception when it reaches the end, rather than you checking for `== None` which has the problem that it'll do the wrong thing if `None` is an item in the list (or indeed, anything that compares equal to it - you should use `is` here if you're checking for exactly `None`). 
maybe this gives some insights [https://blog.qt.io/blog/2018/11/15/python-qt-3000-hours-developer-insight/](https://blog.qt.io/blog/2018/11/15/python-qt-3000-hours-developer-insight/)

I would say uninstall python entirely and anaconda. Restart your computer and make sure there's no python paths in your environment variables. The problem you could be facing could be due to the two different tensor flow versions installed or something with the anaconda configuration. You then want to install the specific python version tensorflow supports (latest). Afterwords install virtualenv, and pip3 for python3. This will help you isolate package installation and let you easily nuke/reset incase something goes wrong again. Within the virtualenv (lookup tutorials), install tensorflow and karas. Then jupyter, then the plotting library in those specific orders. The reason being tensorflow and jupyter usually have a large list of dependencies. If the installation goes well (no errors when testing it out), within your virtualenv directory do a `pip3 freeze &gt; requirements.txt` so you just need to reuse that file for any future environment setups. If you run into issues again just reply back with a full stack trace screenshot and i'll take a look at it. 
Note that your examples aren't actually the same as the OP's here though - they're merging only two generators, while OP takes a list containing an arbitrary number of them. If already sorted, best way is probably to just use the builtin `heapq.merge()`. This'll fetch the first item from each into a min heap, then keep popping off the minimum and fetching the next from the corresponding generator. 
Perfect. Thanks for your help.

Your example isn't really doing anything better than just: return sorted(itertools.chain(*generators)) Because you're still reading all of the generators into a list and just sorting it. Using generators isn't giving you any value, because you're basically converting them to lists by appending all their contents into itemList. It's also doing that a bit oddly. If what you want is to merge a bunch of generators yielding items in sorted order, this is actually already present as `heapq.merge`, which will work without needing to read every generator into a list upfront, instead generating values while only reading a single item from each at a time. Eg: for x in heapq.merge(generators): print(x) 
Flask gives you more options. Django is opinionated. I started out with Django, but ended up using Flask for this exact reason. I want/need more control. If you want to you can set up Flask exactly like Django, except maybe for the underlying ORM. I'm very content with SQLAlchemy as an ORM, it is more powerful than Django's built-in ORM, so maybe if you want to do fancy more complicated stuff on the database-level Flask/SQLAlchemy is more suited.

I'd suggest using general notification services such as https://libraries.io/pypi/mplcursors.
He's not selling it, using it to brand, passing it off as his original work and so on, I agree that he should have sourced it but the copyright doesn't mean he can't make a background out of it and share it on a forum

Well first of all, that artist works for that company. What was your point again?
That is pretty snazzy 
you may use setuptools instead of distutils directly. you'd like to just call setup function. if you install package, you can use \`pip install .\` or \`pip install --editable .\`. \`editable install\` command makes pth entry for your project directory. so you don't need to write installer. &amp;#x200B; PyPA (Python Packaging Authority) has good tutorial ([https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/)).
Technically, it does. If the work is a clear derivative of the original (i.e. minor alterations only, as in this case), it is considered a copy, and its redistribution (i.e. uploading somewhere else) as unauthorised. The grey areas start where the changes are significant enough that the original can be considered an *influence* rather than the primary source. Of course there is a degree of tolerance, authorities have better to do than prosecuting kids sharing pics on the interwebs, but it’s still technically copyright infringement.
If you can provide a source, I'm happy to admit I was in the wrong.

Personally I’m of the opinion that Python isn’t the place to go if you want an executable. If you want to distribute as a script why not put it into a repository pip can reach? This way your app gets updated everytime the user does a pip update. If you are he’ll bent on using distribution packaging systems that is something I can’t address. To say the least though it is a lot of work to do all the flavors out there. As for Linux executing a python file it first needs to be executable in the file system. Second the first line needs to point to the Python interpreter or use the ENV command to find it. You should already know this if you have been executing your app from the command line. To test the various Linux distress you will likely need to install the various distressed into a virtual machine of some sort. Unfortunately this takes a lot of time and resources. Unfortunately you have little choice because some distrust vary in significant ways. This is one reason to avoid distro package managers (there seems to be dozens now) and use pip instead. Your hope is that pip is setup right for the platform it is running on. I’d search out forums for the support of pip and study how pip install some of the popular apps from the pip repositories. The reality is that the use of QT complicates things once more. Try the QT forums for details as to how to make sure the correct libs are included. In any event all of these issues just highlight how bad of a choice Python can be when it comes to distribution. The more platforms supported atheism worse it gets. As such you might want to consider a rewrite in C++ and limit the scope of supported platforms/distro. In the end you will have fewer distribution hassles and you can easily use the systems package managers. 
Absolutely fantastic, 25 years into Python and someone comes up with a way to slice lists. What next, how to use dicts? If this carries on Python might get into the list of the most popular programming languages in the world.
you got your heapq and all, but this is what I came up with as far as lazily evaluated merging of sorted sequences written by hand is concerned #!/usr/bin/env python3 def merge_sorted_sequences(*args): iters = {iter(seq) for seq in args} heads = {} for it in iters: try: val = next(it) heads[it] = val except StopIteration: # ignore initially empty sequences entirely pass while heads: it, yield_val = min(heads.items(), key=lambda t: t[1]) yield yield_val try: next_val = next(it) heads[it] = next_val except StopIteration: # depleted iterator needs to be removed from heads del heads[it] a = [0, 0, 1, 2, 3] b = [4, 5] c = [1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 11] d = [3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 12] e = [] seqs = [a, b, c, d, e] generators = [(x for x in seq) for seq in seqs] expected = sorted(sum(seqs, [])) result = list(merge_sorted_sequences(*generators)) print('result:', result) print('expected:', expected) if result == expected: print('working correctly') else: print('git gud') 
A simple kind of proof of concept for [Stegano](https://github.com/cedricbonhomme/Stegano) (a Python steganography library): [https://stegano-web.herokuapp.com](https://stegano-web.herokuapp.com) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;

Ok cool feel free to go ahead an make [this](https://dribbble.com/shots/4307976-Python-Logo-Abstract/attachments/982245) fully credited version your wallpaper. 
No it wouldn’t be a benefit to the community. But I asked if they were had a higher res version for a wallpaper and they said no. I didn’t crack or undercut anyone. There wasn’t some market for python wallpapers that look almost like this one that I would be competing against by taking someone’s pay-for-use work and redistributing. That simply is not a good analogy. 
Cropping and retouching the advert text out of [this](https://dribbble.com/shots/4307976-Python-Logo-Abstract/attachments/982245) image (the left edge ends up looking whack where the next was so I then had to correct that but I still didn’t get it 100% right) and then using a resolution expander. Yeah not zero effort.

 &gt; We aren't all 12 years old anymore. It has been shown time and again that finding the right demographic, target them with ease of use and access and quality will get you customers that are brand loyal. People who do not pay for your work would not pay for your work anyway. 
Appreciate the feedback! 🙏
If it's for security, you gotta be absolutely sure that the false positive rate is essentially 0. This is kinda sketchy with machine learning... And like all biometrics, it could be forced open by an attacker who has physical control of the employee. You can't *force* someone to give you a password, but you can force their face in front of a camera.
Oh it is entirely possible. Your false match rate would be huge. Facial recognition is generally terrible for any type of biometric usage besides 3d, which is pretty hard to model correctly.
While true - that's not what this is. An artist put up a low res image for portfolio, and OP then hacked up the high-res advertisement itself to make sure no one got credit for it, then gave it away for free for internet brownie points. OP even admits he asked for permission/high res version first (and not getting it) before hacking up the advertisement to give away. Just because it's on the internet does not make it free use or moral to do whatever you want with it.
The advantage of my implementation is that it never needs to sort anything, as long as the inputs are already sorted individually. In order to do that, it needs to be able to inspect the head element from each input generator without committing to consuming it; that's literally all the wrapper does.
