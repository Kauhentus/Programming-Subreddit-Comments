Ladies, with this script you too can download all your dick pics with ease lol jk jk
I see you used selenium. Just wondering.. Is there no way to accomplish this with requests/bs4 or an api? Wouldn't that be more efficient? I believe fb messenger has an api and I thought there was some pre existing messenger packages.
Automatetheboringstuff maybe?
There is probably a way to do it. I wrote this in around a day or so. And I tried going with requests only at first. As it was pretty difficult to get basic request as even logging in with all the data on facebook with request so I went for robobrowser. For some reason specific place I needed to use was no visible in page source (I assumed due to javascript). So I went for selenium instead for picture scrapping part and then downloaded images using requests. I am planning to add multi-threading for sure to make downloading faster, but as for now I don't know how to scrap src from images with requests only. Tho I might take a look into some online api's if there are any good once and maybe make use of it.
Working on my first Python project ever. Never really used it before now. I don't get why `requests.get('reddit.com/r/randomthread123')` returns response 429 (too many requests) when I'm only using `requests.get` one time, not accessing the site any more than that

That sounds very useful. Do you use any windows-native libraries provided with the system itself? Could you "simulate" clicking on some elements without actually moving the mouse pointer? So far I have usually seen GUI automation in Python done with x/y coordinates which isn't the best.
Hi, today I used Selenium with success, my use this time was basic, but work as expected.. thank you so much!
It has pluggable backends. So, right now I have an AutoItX backend because it is the easiest and fastest for me to implement so I can work on the user-facing API. I'll also implement a win32 and UIA backend. All of those let you specify controls in a window by their handle so you don't have to know their x/y coordinates.
üëç Glad you had success 
I see. I can understand your issues with the js. Good luck lol. Even if you can't figure it out, you still expand your knowledge on it so it's not like you're completely wasting your time on it. If you could come up with an efficient way to scrape pics, I'm sure a lot of popular Facebook pages would like that where people submit a lot of stuff. You could make it so that you store the pics into a database and then make a real time webpage showing the latest images. Would be great for like "wtf moments" pages.. But yeah something simple like what you made would be good for downloading a lot of pics you shared with someone. What you already made sounds useful don't get me wrong. A more direct approach to getting the data instead of using selenium sounds more ideal for speed and if you need to tweak it to do other things like auto respond for other reasons then it would be a lot easier with an api. But yeah good luck.
I'm guessing you're trying to run one of the examples they have in the README. In short, yes there's ways to make relative paths system agnostic. If you're still on Python 2.x, take a look at os.path (specifically os.path.join). If you've moved to Python 3, you should be able to use the pathlib module.
My suggestion (and this is by no means professional advice, just how I got into coding) would be to start a project and stick with it. The first real python program I wrote was a basic password cracker, and while the code‚Äôs kinda shit, it was probably my most valuable learning experience. 
Without digging into your code to much (Mainly because Im a newb too) Get rid of the hardcoded creds. Hash them or prompt the user to enter them then hash/send off or do whatever you gotta do with them.
This is not a homework service. 
I was asking for ideas to help me brainstorm not a copy and paste assignment 
Creativity and originality are also skills to be learned. 
So now you need more classes, but the input part will be the same. Fill in your tagged data, train it on some subset of the data, and repeat for each class.
Looking to just collect and work with the data. Not interested in buying / selling, simply collecting the data, setting up tickers, plotting it, etc.

Thanks a lot for Your feedback! This was just a little side-project as I am working currently in other company with PHP as web developer. But I really liked the way python is so I wanted to try. Never thought of making it something bigger then small software. But Your ideas really sounds great of course and I might work on ways to improve it in the future if time allows.
I'm not so familiar with `ffmpeg`, but perhaps you could extract the same data using `ffprobe`, which has support for outputting data in a machine-readable format?
I don't even understand what's happening. Poor me dumb me!
I wasn't aware ffprobe can apply filters, I'll do some testing tonight to see if it gets me what I want. Thanks.
When I created Edabit, the intention was always for it to be the place people go after reading any \[insert\_language\_here\] 101 book. It's supposed to be the tool that gets you through that weird awkward phase once you know what functions, loops, variables, etc ... are. So my advice to you is simply to pick up any Python 101 material and spend a few weeks on it. Then jump into Edabit challenges. At least that's how I always intended the process to look like.
Could this be used for hyper parameter optimization of neural networks?

Check out python's matplotlib package. You can use it to make plots. It has a way to even animate your plots.
Yeah, Guido has been working there for quite a while.

I am new to programming and Python is the first language that I have started to learn in order to help automate some tasks in my daily life. I am a Network Engineer and thought Python would be a great to learn. I have enjoyed it greatly so far. I am working on a homework assignment this week dealing with loops and I have been stuck all day trying to get it to work. The goal is to prompt a user for two integers x= low number y= high number and z= x +y. Then write a loop to count by 2's from x to y. Here is what I have so far... if anyone could help show me what I am doing wrong and how to count by twos in the loop it would be greatly appreciated. x = input("Enter a Low Number:") y = input("Enter a High Number:") z = float(x) + float(y) print(z) num\_list = \[float(x), float(y)\] print(num\_list) while float(x) &lt; float(y): print(float(x)) else: print("X is Greater than Y")
Since this subreddit is for: &gt; News about the dynamic, interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, extensible programming language Python you get rude responses. Try again in /r/learnpython.
+1 for automate the boring stuff with python. It's a super good book and doesn't make too many assumptions of prior knowledge.

It‚Äôs not a trivial thing. Is your optimization problem turkey parallel? Is it just multi-start local optimizations? Then you can do it manually. Is it splitting off runs of the objective function? Then (a) you‚Äôre unlikely to find an optimizer that can do that many at once (unless maybe computing numerical gradients in 30 dim). Then you may be able to use dask or some job queue. Either way, you need to provide a lot more information. And you should do it to /r/LearnPython

Don't provide alternatives such as "yes and no" or "no and... yes" and you're good to go
0) This belongs to /r/LearnPython But some tips: 1) Optimize it more 2) Wasn't enough? Code it in C/C++/Cython as library to be used from Python 3) Still too slow? Can you split the problem and run it parallel? If you can, you could use something like Dask. Anyway, it's often easier to optimize something 30x than make it run in 30 different computers in parallel.
Interesting, did you figure out what is going on?

Further to /u/MisguidedFacts' comment, looking at the source for get\_config indicates it's using os.path.join already, which inserts the correct delimiter for directories on your OS. Use this instead: import os.path env = habitat.Env( config=habitat.get_config(config_file=os.path.join("tasks", "pointnav.yaml")) )

TOS-breaking stuff is pretty much all I write on my personal time. As far as I see it, they're free to try to prohibit something and I'm free to try to do it anyway. As long as I'm doing it for personal use and not for profit, the worst thing that happens is I lose an account or an IP gets banned etc. ChromeDriver / Selenium can be hard to detect or easy depending on how you use it. I usually start with Scrapy (simplest solution first) and move to Selenium if there's more than minimal anti-scraping.
Try https://pythondiscord.com, an amazing community.
They won‚Äôt track you down. Selenium drivers with right pauses basically are humans. They have absolutely no proof to say differently.

If you do it hard enough that it degrades their site, or if you try to profit off of it, they will track you down. Especially if it's a company with deep pockets. It's about how much of a target you make of yourself.
&gt; As far as I see it, they're free to try to prohibit something and I'm free to try to do it anyway. Technically you're not; people have been convicted for things as trivial as bypassing client-side validation by disabling JavaScript in their browsers. Among other things, you may be charged with fraud, copyright infringement, and whatever the legal term for "malicious hacking" is in your country. It's just that in order for that to happen, the target needs to 1) find out about it, 2) have an important enough interest in stopping you, and 3) have enough of a case to actually win it in court, if need be. Because of this, you get away with it in most cases, or you just get banned, simply because that's faster and cheaper than going through the whole legal machinery.
Sure. I meant morally, not legally. Legally you're not at any risk either unless you do something pretty stupid.
Very cool! I will definitely consider this in the future. There is a similar program called MultiNest that is an adaptive MC sample. If I remember correctly it attempts to recognize and break up regions of high likelihood into a finer set of ellipsoids. It also gives a dramatic speed up. I might be a bit off base here, but do you think it would be possible to easily calculate the evidence value similar to MultiNest to allow for model comparison/Bayes factor type stuff? The evidence is an integration over the posterior distribution, which is very hard to do with a homogeneoud grid in high dimensional spaces. 
Ok thanks
&gt;Sorting by difficulty would be a good idea for the site instead of just easy/hard. There you go. Feature added. :)
Just added the ability to sort by specific difficulty and will update the skip/continue algorithm in the near future.

I'm about done working on a bot that takes posts from reddit, converts it into a video with tts and such and automatically uploads it to YouTube. It was surprisingly simple. I wouldn't be surprised if most of those reddit story channels on YouTube are bots. 
Returning to this post after using Plotly Express for the last 2 weeks to say thank you - it really is quite sickening how easy this makes complex layouts. I have two questions, please just point me to documentation if it exists and I've managed to completely miss it: 1. Do you natively support (or plan to support) multiple graph types on a single chart? So for example if I wanted to overlay a line graph of a single series over a bart chart of a different series? 2. I'm also using it in a web app and my quick (probably hacky) approach is to us `plotly.offline.plot`, setting `output_type='div'` and then just passing that through to the views. I don't want to use Dash, is there a more elegant way of passing data through to a web view of plotly that I've missed? Thanks again for this! &amp;#x200B;

Gotcha. If it doesn't work out, you might consider exploring some Python image libraries like PIL

This week I am looking to build a machine learning model with tensorflow that can spot anomalies in log output data and send notifications in response.

How does this relate to Kriging?
It might, see [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b8xk3a/i_wrote_a_python_package_to_do_adaptive_sampling/ek149i5?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).
If it's just one page - you could just type it.
well you are not an Idiot in any possible way because you are learning something, if you learn it very well then it is always beneficial for you. But yes as compared to Python the demand and scope of R is pretty less which makes people to move on Python. Almost most of the application of Programming language is done either with Python or Java . The best Possible solution for your situation is to learn R first . As you have the knowledge of r from before you can learn it in no time and then Pursue any Course like [Diploma in Python](http://pythonandmltrainingcourses.com/courses/best-diploma-in-python-course-in-delhi/) . when you will have the skills of both r and Python it will be very easy to get placed at big Company . With the skills of both this language you can become a Data Scientist too which is a big profile . Don't loose hope , if you learn it properly any technology will be beneficial for us. Thank You
I don't know about that, but I'll look into it, I've added it to our [todo list](https://github.com/python-adaptive/adaptive/issues/178)). See [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b8xk3a/i_wrote_a_python_package_to_do_adaptive_sampling/ek10sjg/) comment of a co-author where he elaborates on the difference with Bayes.
Very nice writeup!

This is faster at running myGP right, not the Python code you write?
I think this is a question that is more suited for the r/learnpython subreddit.
def getInput(): try: Number = int(input(‚ÄúEnter a number‚Äù)) except: print(‚ÄúInvalid Number‚Äù) getInput() 
Or even just numpy.
You are probably using Python 2.x and should be using `raw_input()` instead of `input()`.
It's a VM for small side projects, it will be ok.
Maybe the objective here is to beat pyright in speed. After all, a big advantage that was touted for it was being faster. [https://github.com/Microsoft/pyright](https://github.com/Microsoft/pyright) vs [https://github.com/python/mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) 
Are you trying to write a keylogger? Most browsers / operating systems explicitly protect against practices such as that. So to answer your question: no, not unless the user manually runs the script or executable after downloading. You can have programs run on startup by placing the executable/shortcut in the relevant startup folder for your OS.
There are two aspects to this. 1 Your own personal use. Here all you care about is not getting caught. So, you have to make your program behave like a human. 2 Selling the program Here you are concerned about legal liability. You will need to take legal advice, but you want to make sure that you are not exposed to any legal liability from the users of the website. Remember, that when you sell the software you will have signed a contract with them and you don't want it to be used against you in court.
Correct. Mypy statically analyzes your code and does nothing to affect the runtime performance. This version of mypy is compiled with [mypyc](https://github.com/mypyc/mypyc) to make it faster.
Sounds like you have well optimized Python code, badly optimized C code, or both üòÉ
I understand why you say that, but no, this is not the case. There has been work on making mypy run faster for over a year now. The release of pyright and the speed advantages here are merely a coincidence. Also pyright lowered it's performance claims AIUI.

Python 3.8 is in alpha stage ([https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0569/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0569/)) so probably will not be officially supported by any IDE until release or beta. &amp;#x200B; Referring to pycharm issues for py 3.8: [https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-33884](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-33884) &gt;Python 3.8 is still in alpha, so the feature set is not finalised yet, but PyCharm 2019.1 should at least recognise it as 3.8. &amp;#x200B;

Great! When possible, please also do on NLP courses. You‚Äôll become a DL master while this community will appreciate a similar write up.
Fundamentally, glRotateF is a function to _apply a rotation amount to a display matrix_. It doesn't take velocity, it takes position. Repeatedly applying position, however, does act like it takes velocity. It is also, as you can clearly tell, lossy. It's no different than using "rotate" in photoshop. After a few hundred rotations, things start to get blurry. What you should do is instead rotate the original matrix you use to the position you want every time it needs to change, instead of constantly transforming the one you already have. Instead of managing your rotation state in gl, you need to manage the rotation state in your code, and update the GL each frame with the new state. You can use glLoadIdentity() to reset your matrix state (including translations). However, what you _should_ be doing is using glPushMatrix/glPopMatrix to save and reset your drawing state. Call glPushMatrix before you rotate and draw (display.flip) then call PopMatrix to undo your rotation. 
I'm disappointed to see it's not named PyCraft
It is. Using your domain knowledge to get into programming is a great idea.
Tank you! I will definitely check these courses out adter I finish my specialisation in Coursera.

That‚Äôs said ‚Äî and IANAL ‚Äî the bar in the US for what constitutes ‚Äúhacking‚Äù sufficient to involve Federal criminal liability is _ludicrously_ low thanks to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA).

At the very least if they‚Äôve got more money for lawyers than you you‚Äôll almost certainly either lose or settle any suit they choose to bring on the matter. And if you ever make a dime off of what they consider their data they will have considerable incentive to choose to bring such a suit. So, best advice, just stop once you‚Äôve asked this question out loud. If you can‚Äôt plead ignorance, you‚Äôll end up pleading something more harmful to yourself. _Definitely_ abandon any thought of selling your work.
How about the Udacity courses?
If you have even the slightest amount of preexisting experience in one framework over the other, go with what‚Äôs more familiar. They can all do what you want so go for what‚Äôs comfortable. If you don‚Äôt have any experience with either, Django might be easier to learn. I prefer Flask but Django will pick a lot more defaults for you. 
You're opening the file and parsing it every time you need to do anything. That's a really suboptimal way of doing things, especially if settings get accessed often, since Python's JSON parser is pretty slow. Have you considered caching the data in your object instead, and saving it when needed?
&gt; Could I make this run on another persons computer without them having the modules listed above or python? No, unless you were to compile it using py2exe/pyinstaller. (Technically the module would be included in the executable, though). &gt; Also, could I have these open without having to edit it as a script and run it? Even when you compile it to an executable, the user still needs to double click the program to run it. (Or add it to start-up to have it start automatically on boot). So, it will always need the user's co-operation to work. On a side-note, your question is better suited for r/learnpython.
It depends on what do you want to do, it's difficulty, and the scalability you want to obtained. Flask is a micro-framework, this means that the is a small base to make an easy a lightweight web service. There are multiple plugins or add-ons to add persistence, user management, websockets and other features to your service. On the other hand, Django is a more complete and complex framework. It doesn't only set the basic features needed but force you to adapt to their projects structure. IMHO, Flask can adapt better to your protect in case you want to work with third party modules.
That's a good idea. I was actually considering it a while ago. The implementation will arrive soon!
The use of angular is no issue here. &amp;#x200B; Pick flask if your application is extremely simple, or if you like to make conscious choices about every feature. Django is better if you want everything out of the box, which ensures all features fit well together, it is also very well documented for python standards. &amp;#x200B; When you pick django you will need some time to read documentation. When you pick flask you might probably need to search for some packages that fix your need.
Right now I guess pycharm is the best choice for 3.8. 3.8 really simplifies a lot of code, so I am using it for a future product. Thought there are more people, despite the beta status

another option would be to use python 3.7 and from future import walrus operator. Don't know if such a library exists

Python is interpreted, so it won't run without python. However, that doesn't mean that python has to be installed, you can include a copy in your program directory or even bundle your program and the python runtime into a single file.
This question would be better for r/learnpython. You also could have phrased it a lot better, it took me a while to figure out what you're actually asking for. You could probably use some kind of loop, if the dataframes are iterable you could use `zip` to iterate through both of them, subtract, and put the result in a new dataframe. Or there might be a built-in method that you could find in the documentation of the unspecified library you're using for dataframes. I don't know. Not enough information.
I assumed one would already be using numpy, good to point this out! 
Ofc ur using another library on top of it its not C its python c lib :D
[removed]
that's probably a classic case of running a library that is based on highly optimized code (e.g. numpy that is mostly optimized C code) and trying to write better C code. Not saying it is impossible but it is really hard and the optimization process takes lots of time. 
Ok, that makes sense to me. Your co-authors comment also cleared things up. Still, a very cool package I hope to use in the future
Ooh ok, websockets then is important to mention (especially since is not Angular specific). You probably want flask-socketIO or django-channels then. &amp;#x200B; If you are using websockets you probably want low latency and high control. I personally would gravitate towards flask in that scenario. But I must say that I have no experience with either of these packages.
thanks
Aye. If it is actually a ToS, and not some other form of agreement, those terms are simply the terms under which you may operate on the site free of intervention. Worst they can do is ban you. If it's not actually a ToS but something else, that may not be the case.
1. /r/learnpython 2. Look into `os.path.listdir` and `for` loops.

&gt;thanks! sorry I posted on the wrong sub
Ha Ha. So true. I tried writing some OpenCL code to solve a finite difference problem. Turns out programming GPUs is very hard. I got far better results using OpenMP to make better use of my CPU.
I've wrote a program at work that uses our competitors private API. Can I get in a lot of trouble for that? When I was navigating around their Angular website with devtools open in Chrome I could see requests being made to an API, so my program just contacts the API directly.
Out of curiosity, what are some practical applications for your package? It's incredibly intriguing but I interested to know what someone could do with this information!
I'll try to implement such a system ! But then everything would happen from the terminal
This is useful for literally **everyone** that evaluates mathematical functions in Python that are "slow". Where slow is defined as: taking longer than 1 second. There are some more examples in the gallery: https://adaptive.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage_examples.html 
What option should I use when opening the file so that I can read and write to it?
Why do you want to do that?
Otherwise, I would have to load the file twice. Once with `r` and other with `w`.
Why do you need to load it twice? You only open it for reading when your class is instantiated, and then you only open it for writing when needed.
Oh. Thanks!
You can make it without the users prompt by hashing the password. Just don't hard code it. This code is still vulnerable to credential theft but its better then hardcoded. You have a few choices here, the following I found on StackOVerflow rather quickly: import yagmail yag = yagmail.SMTP() yag.send(contents = ["See picture below", "/local/path/to/img.png"]) To get this done, first install (below) and then register your email into the keyring once by using: yagmail.register('myemail', 'mypass') If you also put a .yagmail file in your home (~) folder containing your username, you can use yagmail.SMTP() in your script and safely login. Install: pip install yagmail # python 2 pip3 install yagmail # python 3 Another option is to just hash and decrypt: Our encryption app: encrypt.py 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 import sys from simplecrypt import encrypt, decrypt from base64 import b64encode, b64decode from getpass import getpass password = getpass() message = sys.argv[1] cipher = encrypt(password, message) encoded_cipher = b64encode(cipher) print(encoded_cipher) Our decryption app: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 import sys from simplecrypt import encrypt, decrypt from base64 import b64encode, b64decode from getpass import getpass password = getpass() encoded_cipher = sys.argv[1] cipher = b64decode(encoded_cipher) plaintext = decrypt(password, cipher) print(plaintext) Problem with the last one is the keys to the kingdom are in the code still and easily detectable. I would do some research into this and am curious what kind of solution you come to. I'm studying infosec and have am a Python Hobbyist so if you decide to pursue this it will make you a better coder. I would be curious to know what you use.
Thanks, but it was just a silly mistake and easy to fix. I thought it was a funny screenshot so I decided to share.

If you're familiar with OpenMP, you could try OpenACC for GPU programming, it's about the same level of abstraction. The Portland Group compilers with OpenACC support are free for personal use, I think.

How exactly does it simplify except with the walrus operator? 
How is numpy optimized? I do know that vectorization using numpy runs extremely fast compared to python, partly because it's a 100% array operation, but I'm curious how they manage to optimize things so fast.

Just making your program artificially slow. Overall pretty decent for a first little guy. Check out click and see if you can convert the tool to use it :)
Some ideas: - instead of `get`, `set`, `rem`, define `__getitem__`, `__setitem__` and `__delitem__` - Do not write `with open(...)` all over the place but place them in one common function that does this one thing for you, maybe `update()` for reading and `save()` for writing. - Allow the user to enable/disable auto-saving to file. - Do not clear the storage by writing `{}` to file, empty out `self.data` instead. - Do not create an empty file on first initialization. - Don't assume a default filename.
If you could run arbitrary code on other people's machines when they download a file, without an absolutely massive security vulnerability exploit at play, the world as we know it would literally end in a day.
Your loop is this: while float(x) &lt; float(y): print(float(x)) You said you want to count by 2's, so where is that part? I suggest you add a line where you increase x in each run, like this: while float(x) &lt; float(y): print(float(x)) x = x+2 &amp;#x200B;
May be there is classic error of converting code from some king languages like python to either C or C++ - copying of heavy objects - vectors, matrices instead of passing by pointer or reference in C++ case
This just happened with me. I was prototyping something using Javascript's big numbers, very easy to use btw, and then rewrote it in C using GMP and it went significantly slower. I'm like 90% sure I know the issue(s) but haven't felt like going back to it. I also tried Rust using num, and that was a mess mostly because I hadn't really used Rust before so it was longest to develop and slowest, but there are certainly things I can do to speed it up. It's just a matter of whether rustc will let me...

No.
Should autosave be on by default? What should I do with the \`change\` and \`clear\` functions?
Im over 40 and learning
Got it.
Its never too late to learn things :) 
Seriously? Of course it's not too late. It's never too late, and you're not even _that_ old :)
No chance. Don‚Äôt touch it. 
I'm working on a side project to enable everyone to have their own personal assistant with a bit of NLU (thanks to snips-nlu) and a developer friendly API to make skills easily. The library is working well (https://github.com/atlassistant/pytlas) and I have already made a quick server to expose the library via WebSockets (https://github.com/atlassistant/pytlas-server) and an android application (https://github.com/atlassistant/pytlas-mobile) to communicate with this server. I just need more time to add more docs and polish.
You might also consider posting this to/r/learnmachinelearning 
Unless it's how to pack your parachute.
Since you already have solid answers, I'll just point out that the r/learnpython sub is a great resource if you have other questions.
Started with 19. Can't imagine what happened if I were one year older. &amp;#x200B; It's never to late to learn python, your brain won't explode.
That doesn't sound right. It's interesting how much of a variation in speed there is in benchmarks like [this](http://www.wilfred.me.uk/blog/2014/10/20/the-fastest-bigint-in-the-west/). Haskell's GMP implementation kids ass compared to everything else, though CPython at only 3x slower. The C GMP implementation should beat Haskell's implementation.
Thank you for this! I'm looking to get into computer vision after finishing my PhD and this will come very handy. I've already done some tests with NN but I haven't implemented anything on my own. The ImageNet bundle seems the most appropriate for me, but it is too expensive at $600 so I'll probably go for the $10 course.
well.. xD 
I attribute the slowness of my C GMP code to not knowing best practices around it. Also I primarily use node/python so I'm less comfortable when I need to manage my own memory, which was another aspect of this because I was generating a list
@Flogge Ping!
that's literally what gave me a raise and full time where I'm working... still generating some of the studies based 100% on their data to this day, no shame.
You should ask basic questions on r/learnpython, but a couple of things: \- you need a counter that starts at the low number and gets incremented by 2 every iteration of the loop \- the loop should end when that counter is higher than the high number \- just set x = float(x) and y=float(y) after the inputs so you don't have to keep repeating "float()" over and over
You are probably early compared to many of us.
From my limited knowledge they just write extremely optimized C code that can be invoked by Python. So it's doing most of those intensive operations with compiled C at the speed you would expect compiled C to run.
So was it faster after the mistake was fixed?
Name was taken sadly
I don't think `change` is needed... And clear: `self.data = {}`
You converted to Cython, not C, and you're probably also measuring the conversion and compilation steps, not just the resulting binary module.
Should I add autosave logic to `clear`?
Type the following in CMD to install: `python3.6 -m pip install beautifulsoup4` Replace `python3.6` with your version of python. This will ensure it is installed to that version of Python for you.
\`r+\` is read and update permission.
Ask at r/learnpython, we will be happy to awnser your question 
Yeah significantly so. 
Agreed. Never too late.
You don‚Äôt have to be young to learn firstly. Second, even if you did, the cutoff wouldn‚Äôt be 20. Most doctors don‚Äôt actually get medical training until they‚Äôre over 20. (Gotta get that pretty much irrelevant to practicing medicine bachelors degree first)
Ok.
That is actually so awesome to here. Glad people don't worry about 'being too old to learn'. You have an amazing attitude towards learning.
20 is very young. Agreed.
Yeah, he said that it was a silly mistake that he fixed easily. The C code ran much faster after the fix.
I love adventures! The new places and new activities. The feeling of accomplishment after getting something done. Learning is a wonderful thing. It took me 3 weeks and so many different ways that i tried to reverse a string for an abacus program. But the other day i found it and you know i was talking about it
I feel you. The feeling you get when you finish something is amazing. Are you on the discord server for this group?
Like i said i already installed it for 3.7 the version i am using. The package is even visible in the libaries in my project. 
Then what is the issue? 
The compiler still says that it cannot find the package
Send your code. Shoe how you are importing. 
Also try running pip freeze to see what's actually there
Why would you do this?
depends on the site. I think google does anti-botting by tracking likes like mouse movements and scrolling.
Working on a gift for my girlfriend. I recently got a starter electronics kit with led's and buzzers and LCD screens that can be connected to the Pi. I host a Minecraft server on my Pi shared with just me and my gf. My script will flash an LED and a buzzer when a specific lever in the game is pressed. I normally leave the server up while I'm away or studying at my desk, so if my gf misses me she can log onto our server and spam the lever and I'll see the LED in my room flash and buzz. The interaction from a Minecraft instance and the real world is very interesting and I'm thinking of more ideas on how to take that further than just lighting up LED's and buzzers. Apart from that I'm also developing a program to help me learn Chinese. And I also hope to work on the Chinese text-based game I was working on in the past.

 While True: time.sleep(1) 
Is PyCharm still indexing? I found that PyCharm sometimes messes up packages and needs restart. Another more robust way might be to create a new virtualenv, install needed packages and use it in this project (it's much more reliable and manageable in my opinion). &amp;#x200B;
Even more so, if you use the numpy version, which comes with Anaconda. There they make extensive uses of the Intel Math Kernel Library, so that they can squeeze out all available performance from vectorization optimization.
i restarted it a couple of times by now at first it was underlining the imports because it they werent installed for 3.7, but after i did it for 3.7 it stopped underlining them and only gives me an errror on running. How do i add the packages from the virtualenv to my project ? &amp;#x200B;
YES! Edabit is awesome. It helps to quickly train programming concepts. I think exercism is the next step as it is more project based.
Interesting! Thanks for sharing. 
What was the silly mistake? 
Indeed they did: [https://github.com/Microsoft/pyright/commit/0017f645b3716e7026b625e2a9cf1b5cbc85fc48](https://github.com/Microsoft/pyright/commit/0017f645b3716e7026b625e2a9cf1b5cbc85fc48).
I probably spent six weeks trying to figure out how to reproject polar data to x,y. I couldn't find a formula to do it, so I had to do it with loops. I tried all sorts of fancy stuff to make the python faster. The best I could do, with a very complex method, was 10 seconds per reproduction. The worst I got was something like 800 seconds. I finally went to C, and did a really stupid loop, nothing fancy, and it completes in .3 seconds.
Using C

He used strings instead of char pointers. It's a noob mistake. 
i managed to make one a while ago. what have you done so far?
Just a little life hack, use Google Rewards Surveys and the Udemy App. The Google funds can be used to make payments, and Udemy Mobile prices are are almost always 90% + off. 
Please explain 
So in microcontrollers, space is extremely limited. We can't afford to use complex strings. Instead we have char arrays and pointers. Pointers are... Pointers :D. However, what's cool about then is that they point to the location of your data in the microcontroller's memory. Pointers make your data more reusable and easier to iterate through. If you use pointers in python, your code would be even faster; though I believe pointers don't exist in python. 
Django for a more complete framework, batteries included so to speak. Flask if you are going for lightweight and simple, or need to do many customizations.
 I guess with a shim library for the "walrus operator" vscode and the python extension would work perfectly fine. I don't see yet any additional benefits to switch to 3.8

Exactly. It‚Äôs so weird over here, originally I moved to GA from Cali and there were MeetUps groups everywhere. Out here it‚Äôs always only Atlanta. 
Sweet! Thank you! 
I might be misunderstanding this, but aren't all variables in Python essentially pointers? As I understand it, Python has stored objects that are referenced when declaring a variable. So if for example, you write: a = 1 What you actually do is create the pointer \`a\` that points to the object in Python memory that corresponds to the integer \`1\`
Thanks very much for sharing!

Thank you [FAVORED\_PET](https://www.reddit.com/user/FAVORED_PET)! &amp;#x200B; In short, "push and pop" worked as a charm! &amp;#x200B; In detail, you are absolutely right. Rotate function does takes position. The continuous rotation makes it feels like taking velocity. Actually I was thinking to 1) somehow reset the view (cannot find the function) or 2) even rotating it back (crazy idea, feels really wrong). But push and pop does exactly what should be done. What a nice concept. Appreciated your help!
&amp;#x200B; I see. The input function returns a string (like "42") not a number (like 42). You can convert it like this: &amp;#x200B; x_str = input("Enter a Low Number:") x = int(x_str) y_str = input("Enter a High Number:") y = int(y_str)
The non-conda version of numpy that you install via pip uses OpenBLAS, which also gives significant performance improvements over building from source without a BLAS library. The differences in the two (OpenBLAS vs. IntelMKL) vary by numpy function/method. &amp;#x200B; Whenever possible, I try and use numpy installed via conda, but that's not always doable; if you're trying to squeak out every bit of performance, that would be a good first step.
x = r * cos(theta) y = r * sin(theta) ?
AMD CPUs can also use Intel MKL from what I understand; I've read that there are benefits in comparison to OpenBLAS as well there, but this isn't something I've seen benchmarks on or anything. &amp;#x200B; Also Intel MKL performance will vary with instruction set extensions on the CPU, for example, I could see a case of an Intel CPU with AVX-512 significantly outperforming (on some numpy operations) Intel CPUs with just AVX-2.

Yea I'm reading a good book on it now, "learning Python" by Mark Lutz. He says that's why Python doesn't need variable's types declared since the type is stored at the object level while the variable just points to the obj. 
numpy is a python library wrapped around a much faster C library.
This is how all imperative programming languages function.
You obviously have no idea how to write code.
IIRC, that compiled C is also using multiple CPU cores when available, without any of the problems that come with introducing multiprocessing into Python. All outside the GIL, too.
Good small post for beginners :)

Nice! The code is easy to read, well commented, and looks like it was a blast to make! If you want to take it to the next level, consider these ideas.. - Get the while loop to be breakable by an escape sequence, like ctrl-c - Change some of the commentary to docstrings - Allow the user to pass their text in the CLI like so ./morse.py ‚ÄúThis is a string to be converted‚Äù
I've been telling myself that for the last 5 years of writing code.
Mayb be this bot is the one that needs some deep learning.
That's really interesting. OpenBLAS is so common I just assumed the conda version used it.
No, it's not
Interesting. Have you thought about packaging up and uploading to PyPI?
Thanks! Well prepared review. 
It‚Äôs a little more complicated than that. Think of a radar, where the data comes back from the radar as angle, distance, reflectivity. Now just switching that data to x,y,reflectivity is how you suggested. But really the radar is telling you what the refelectivity is for some 2D area out in the world somewhere. The datapoint, in relation to the rest of the data, is really an annulus. So figuring out that annulus and drawing it on a map, with the rest of the data, is what I had to do. I‚Äôm sure there is a more mathematical way to do it, but my method seemed to be similar to how others did it. 
Heard kivy could help with that, although no experience with it :)
So what you‚Äôre saying is you bamboozled us?
Yeah, having to track and declare variable types was a bit of shock to my system learning Fortran after starting out in Python. I just kept thinking "there has to be a better way", which I guess is how Python got started.
No, not at all. Python is somewhat unique in this regard.
To be clear technically its not a pointer. Python is pass by object-reference.
Don't give up. Keep trying. You're obviously dealing with a serialization issue which is killing your performance. I would start there. 
I'm kidding. I fixed it right away after this test. I was just being lazy tbh. Someone asked me to post details, so I'm going to when I get home tonight.
So which imperative language doesn't use references?
Thanks changed it
You can use the openblas version with conda, it used to be if you installed numpy from conda forge it would use openblas, not sure if that's still the case.
Flask was easier for me personally because Django expects you to do things a certain way, which means some initial reading has to be done. Flask had me going in minutes, but it might require you to know what you want to do in more detail.
Ah. Facetious retort. After 25+ years of developing software, I still have problems picking up on that. 
Thanks for actually looking at my stuff! The sleep was added in some people can read the success or failure messages. I was going to add click in addition to the CLI. Again, thanks so much for looking at my project!
Awesome! That seems to work. I appreciate the help and the lesson. Thank you.
Also try pypy next time. 
Your welcome :)
Very strange slide (#3). C and C++ are also used for web (standalone web UI and CGI). Java (NanoVM, Java Card) and .NET (.NET micro framework) have embedded platforms support, as well as Python (MicroPython).
numpy does not support xlsx, try pandas: import numpy as np import pandas as pd xlsx = pd.read_excel('excelFile.xlsx') data = np.array(xlsx) 
not sure why you don't want to use pandas. there are some other libraries that allow you to read xlsx files, numpy does not support xlsx itself. loadtxt is for text based formats like csv files. https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/python-excel-tutorial
Did you try making the grid finer? Play with the 0.01 here: u, v = mgrid[- 0.035:pi:0.01, - 0.035:pi:0.01] 
What was the mistake?
Hashing is not the same as encryption.

For each of those libraries there was a time when Python existed and the library did not. That means the authors had their reasons to use it before they've created their libraries :-) So yes, you can use Python without any of third party libraries. It's just MUCH more efficient not to do so
Out of curiosity, is there a reason you're reluctant to learn Python modules? While they're perhaps not literally essential, they're often practically so in any professional application.
There is just a few that I think are good, but that's about it: numpy, fastprint (I made fast print lol), and pickle
Modules are one of the best things python has. Definitely worth! But, learn only things you need. Interested in Machine Learning? Learn Tensorflow2.0 or PyTorch. Interested in Web? Flask or Jango. If you mean built-in modules, don‚Äôt bother bout them much, there‚Äôre a lot of them and you don‚Äôt need every single one, you‚Äôll find and learn what you need by doing things, on your way! Have a good luck with this language, bud!
Yes, moving the surface about becomes much slower, but the jagged edge problem remains. 
Are you from India?
Thanks! I might actually try and make a command line piano, also what do you mean by "pass their text in the CLI"?
Thats amazing for someone whos just learnt python, well done
Since i used both of them i had the opposite problem: Python so much slower than C

Once you learn the base syntax of any language the first thing you start looking for is that language‚Äôs mechanism for re-using code... no, there‚Äôs no reason to learn Python without learning, at a minimum, how to find and use modules in the standard library.
The jagged edges you're seeing are produced by aliasing which happens when you try to draw diagonal or curved lines using discrete pixels. You need to apply some sort of antialiasing filter to fix this problem. This kind of filtering is really time-expensive if it's not done on the GPU. I don't know Mayavi at all, but quickly looking at the documentation, I get the impression that it might only be applied when you create an image using the screenshot function. It also seems to be controlled by the **figure.scene.anti\_aliasing\_frames** parameter. [https://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/auto/mlab\_figure.html?highlight=aliasing#screenshot](https://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/auto/mlab_figure.html?highlight=aliasing#screenshot) &amp;#x200B;

Looks like the [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.pencolor) mention that the color string is just a "Tk color specification string". A quick search of that phrase comes up with [this](https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TkCmd/colors.htm) as the list of recognized colors. Also note that you can set custom colors with their red, green, and blue components (see the same link to the docs above).
No.
Seriously there's no function to convert polar to rectangular coordinates? I wrote that code 25 years ago. 
I‚Äôm working on a project know requiring me to write to excel‚Äî Look into openpyxl; a set of libraries that can alleviate extracting from workbooks/sheets in a favorable fashion.
TIL about winsound, the built-in library for beep sounds
Realistically, if you want to run the package unmodified you'll need to run it in its native environment. The easiest way to do this is probably to spin up a container or a VM. I usually use VirtualBox for this, but YMMV. 
This is a pretty cynical take, but on some level I agree. I see companies (mine included) trying to (ab)use celery to manage complex, interconnected asynchronous workflows, and it tends to break down very quickly and spectacularly. In my opinion, it's good for just the occasional out-of-band job like sending out a periodic email blast or doing some data aggregation in the background. Anything more complex than that will become a never-ending grief generator. If you need that complexity, then pick a more apt tool than Python.
I'm not reluctant. Complete opposite intact. I will happily use them because it makes things easier. I was just wondering, from a learning perspective that is, if it's worth to learn making things from scratch But apart from the learning side of things and when it comes to actual application, I fully intend to use modules
What imperative language doesn't use references? C, C++, Go, Rust, and more. You can manually get reference semantics in these languages by using pointers (and C++ and Rust have special reference types). 
Do you know if I was to go for the beginners bundle for 100ish dollars and later but next bundle would the price of the first one be deducted.of the later one or is it the whole price that I would have to pay?
I think, my sir, that you're trying to fool us. If you're an actual new user that simply copy pastes everything, then you'll get an exception because time is not set.
Post to r/learnpython 
I believe this is a rather old talk! Beyond that stage fright is a strange thing you can do fine one day and a week later have a difficult time even delivering a coherent sentence. It would s a real strange feeling that I experienced in college communications class. You do one quick stand up and believe everything is fine. Two weeks later you are grasped by the strangest feelings you will ever have. So yeah difficult to follow but I think understand what-is happening. Frankly my college experience killed any desire I ever had for public speaking. 
[Astropy](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/) is the package you're looking for.
I'd email him. I think I did that and he said you'd just have to pay the balance, but that was early last year
Thanks!
Honestly, PyImage is all you need, but Rajeev's course is a very good second, especially given the price.
Wow, ok going to do this from now on!
Well I don't own the ImageNet bundle, but for the looks of it, if you've got the money it would be amazing. The other $10 courses are also amazing in value. 
Did not give those a try sadly, I often find Udacity either outdated or patronizing at times 
I've done Jose Portilla's NLP course on Udemy, also highly recommned it!
The `np.loadtxt` function is for reading simple text files such as tab-delimited files or `csv`s. It will not work on Excel documents. Excel documents are compressed `xml` documents. If you really can‚Äôt use other external libraries, then I guess you can hack together an xml reader for this document. It would be much easier, however, to use either `pandas` or `xlwings`. 
look into argparse. You would basically do this: parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='This app converts to morse!') parser.add_argument('text', help='string to be converted') args = parser.parse_args() Then your text is available inside `args.text` What this code does is register an argument parser, that will prepare your app to receive arguments from the command line. On the first line we start up the parser. On the second line, we register an argument. It is called 'text', and there is a help text. Help texts are cool! If you run `python yourcode.py -h` it will output a cool help to guide users on how to use your app via the command line! Give it a try! Lastly, when we call parse\_args, we retrieve the args and store them on the args variable. There is lots of things to do with argparse, here are my favorites: * Registering Mutually Exclusive Groups of args, so your program will expect either param A or param B, but never both (cool for flags and stuff) * Registering file type arguments, so the file will be ready for you to access, not just a filename string (you could use this to read a file and convert IT to morse!) * Registering named arguments, so you can go `yourcode.py --text "I'll convert this text"` or even `yourcode.py --file file_to_convert.txt` and you'll be passing down args to your code like a PRO(grammer) Sorry for the wall of text, I recently learned this and love passing what I know to the next guy :p
If you try to use a txt reader on xlsx you dont deserve that job...
Oh men feel much better now! Thanks for that :)
OOF
Agreed. And it also gives you motivation. For those whose expertise is computer science itself, programming for the code is already fun, but we can also employ our hobbies into it! Like music :D
Interesting! I wonder if they are doing something to their python plugin for IntelliJ IDEA, which is what I've got at work. 
i would use VScode, i use it and havent had many problems 
I've been scaffolding a small Django app to record water sample test results for a bunch of swimming pools. I'll flesh it out once we have the pools up and running. The goal is to keep an iPad in the lab to record the samples, and for me to be alerted if any of the values are out of range. Should be doable despite my limited Django skills. 
I'll look into it
wot
Ah I see - I completely misunderstood you! It depends on your end goals, I think. Using numpy/scipy as an example, there's a definite case for one writing their own numerical method instead of scipy.integrate.ode, or writing one's own neural network from scratch for learning how they're built. On the other hand, unless you want to be a library developer, there's probably not much to gain from writing things like matrix multiplication or symbolic differentiation from scratch.
You'll get a syntax error first from having a capitalized while.
I feel attacked!
I also would like to know it! I'm a biologist, mainly studying with DataCamp and Coursera
TL;DR ???
Will probably start deploying for Pycharm
This week I'm working on a Python/Flask web application based on a blockchain framework, to allow users sell/buy tickets for events

They're missing the most obvious collaboration, which is sticking PyCharm Community Edition in the Anaconda installer. 
No simplifications, but huge speedups * Doubled the speed of class variable writes. When a non-dunder attribute was updated, there was an unnecessary call to update slots. (Contributed by Stefan Behnel, Pablo Galindo Salgado, Raymond Hettinger, Neil Schemenauer, and Serhiy Storchaka in [bpo-36012](https://bugs.python.org/issue36012).) * Reduced an overhead of converting arguments passed to many builtin functions and methods. This sped up calling some simple builtin functions and methods up to 20‚Äì50%. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [bpo-23867](https://bugs.python.org/issue23867), [bpo-35582](https://bugs.python.org/issue35582) and [bpo-36127](https://bugs.python.org/issue36127).)
I'm so glad you like it! Answers: 1. not yet but we're working on a set of functions to do exactly this 2. we're mostly focused on Dash as a mechanism for this, but what you're describing should work. Alternatively, you could serialize to JSON and send the JSON payload to the browser and use plotly.js to render it once there. This is how plotly.py/plotly\_express work under the hood
Portfolios are more important than certificates. While certificates can be important (Dataquest, Datacamp, Coursera etc) it's more important to have a great portfolio.
I agree. Check out pandas.read_excel() The only downside I‚Äôve found is that if you freeze you code (pyinstaller, etc) like I do, pandas makes the exe pretty large. 
It was already possible to use Anaconda with Pycharm right? What does this collaboration mean?
What's your project?
I think by default it installs Spyder because the intent was that it's more familiar for people coming from matlab to jump in and start working. Probably will install Pycharm now
Django has more packages contributed by the community like all-auth, tables2, Crispy-forms, etc
I'm not sure about other industries, but in the web dev world, a Python certification (if such a thing exists) would impress no one.
I think after I heard the 10th story of some company getting burned badly by celery, I kinda lost all hope for that thing. There are so many horrific, unfixed, almost impossible to debug, mission critical [bugs](https://github.com/celery/celery/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Issue+Type%3A+Bug+Report%22) in that thing, its comical. &gt;If you need that complexity, then pick a more apt tool than Python. exactly, thing is also that you can even still use python for the tasks themselves, just don't use it to execute, control, schedule or monitor the task (at least not with celery). For example with [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/).
Got the same goin here. Im just a fan of the themes lol
/r/learnpython is a better place to ask
Thanks, I did try that but got unstuck and went with the div option. I‚Äôll do some further reading now I know that‚Äôs a valid route!
But Spyder is free and I love it! Haven't use PyCharm, so I have to ask, what will make it better than Spyder?
It's for extra credit at school... 
Everyone is asking one the mistake was. I'm truly interested in how fast your code is now that the mistake is corrected.
PyCharm has a free community edition. You only have to pay if you want stuff like web development and database features. Scroll to the bottom here to compare: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/
As others have mentioned, portfolios are important. I would also practice writing code with a pencil and paper pad, without a computer. Why? Because you're likely to be asked to solve some problem at a whiteboard, which is basically the same thing. Good to have done it a bit first.
As mentioned - it's free but they have a version with additional features. I'm not very familiar with Spyder so I can't tell you the differences. I know I liked the Spyder variable explorer because it was similar to Matlab when I started programming but now I strongly prefer Pycharm and Notebooks.
I'll try PyCharm this weekend, regarding the variable explorer (something important to me) does PyCharm have something similar?
If they merge anaconda with pycharm I am going to be very happy 
It seems nowadays people are flocking to JupyterLab for that sort of experience, anyways.
Omg!
What is Anaconda? Can someone fill me in?
Try using a session: [http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#session-objects](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#session-objects)
Can you figure out a way to generate a request that takes you directly to the data after the "view more" step?
You have credentials in your file - should remove and change link to a version without. When it's exiting is it successfully completing or erroring? Have no experience with either of these things but maybe you're experiencing some api limit and getting an exception ? You've got a while true and no timeouts / sleeps.
Thanks. I knew some python before, but past couple weeks was when I really started taking a more structured long-term approach to learning it. I‚Äôm curious how you made yours... it took me a long time googling to figure out certain tasks needed. 
This is welcome news..

Ah, that makes sense. In most scenarios memory movement is far slower than math/number crunching when it comes to programming today. GMP is just a handful of math calculations, where the math is going to be faster than the loading and unloading of variables within the bignums. For this reason, not dynamically allocating memory is of the highest importance if you've got the need for speed. Languages like C it's reasonably easy to keep fast, because you can identify when memory is being (c|m|re|de)alloced, which is slow. It's also easy to see in C if data is being copied during a function call or being passed by pointer. The C way is to preset the size of the array and per-initialize it. Once all your variables are setup, then the benchmark starts over the math, not over the whole program. This is because in the real world, you setup your variables once (think like a loading screen in a video game) and then then use those variables for as long as the program is running, which could be months, so there is no point in bench marking the program startup time and instead benching the real world speed of what the program would be like past load. Kind of like benching the fps after the loading screen, not during. In higher level languages, even in C++, let alone Python and Javascript, it can be harder to tell what memory management is happening under the hood, which can cause surprise slowdowns. Like in C, benching should be done after variables are initialized. In modern languages, if you can keep the language from dynamically initializing variables, the slowdown should be unnoticeable from C for most real world tasks, if what you're doing fits into the cache of a modern language (which is probably does if you're not writing a video game). The problem is, how do you get Python to not dynamically malloc data in the middle of running? The answer: You don't. You can't. Which is why Python in the real world is often 66 to 100+ times slower. A single malloc on a modern processor starts at ~20 times slower than using a preallocated variable, and that's if the cache is on your side. Newer processes are slated to get even slower when it comes to dynamic memory allocation.

Ah, that makes sense. In most scenarios memory movement is far slower than math/number crunching when it comes to programming today. GMP is just a handful of math calculations, where the math itself is faster than the loading and unloading of variables within each bignum. For this reason, not dynamically allocating memory is of the highest importance if you've got the need for speed. Languages like C it's reasonably easy to keep fast, because you can identify when memory is being (c|m|re|de)alloced, which is slow. It's also easy to see in C if data is being copied during a function call or being passed by pointer. The C way is to ahead of time know the size of the array and pre-initialize it. Once all your variables are setup, then the benchmark starts over the math, not over the whole program. This is because in the real world, you setup your variables once (think like a loading screen in a video game) and then then use those variables for as long as the program is running, which could be months, so there is no point in benchmarking the program startup time and instead benching the real world speed of what the program would be like past load. Kind of like benching the fps after the loading screen, not during. In higher level languages, even in C++, let alone Python and Javascript, it can be harder to tell what memory management is happening under the hood, which can cause surprise slowdowns. Like in C, benching should be done after variables are initialized. In modern languages, if you can keep the language from dynamically initializing variables, the slowdown should be unnoticeable from C for most real world tasks, if what you're doing fits into the cache of a modern language (which is probably does if you're not writing a video game). The problem is, how do you get Python to not dynamically malloc data in the middle of running? The answer: You don't. You can't. Which is why Python in the real world is often 66 to 100+ times slower. A single malloc on a modern processor starts at ~20 times slower than using a preallocated variable, and that's if the cache is on your side. Newer processes are slated to get even slower when it comes to dynamic memory allocation.
Spyder lacks a lot of features that most IDEs should have. No multiline selection or editing, for example. And they're slow to put out updates for things that they do implement. They've been sitting on an update for ~2 years that adds code folding. You can search the issue on their github, and one of their lead devs responds every 6 months saying it will be in the next update. I realize they're open source, so on one hand I'm impressed with what they've created, but I'm also disappointed. I will gladly try pycharm if it comes with anaconda.

I just want them to fix the Jupyter Notebooks bugs on Pycharm...
I'm confused, why not just use PyCharm?
The overrides? That thing tilts me so hard. I often make notebooks for all the projects I work on for prototyping and then add a copy of the notebook generated as .py with some cleanup to start combining and just keep them binded. I then usually open the full project in pycharm to start working on the full directory and when I first noticed the overrides I couldnt figure out why they were happening for the life of me. It makes me want to just not touch pycharm at all since it forces me to now just keep the notebooks outside the project directory,
Thanks I forgot my credentials were there! Also, I managed to fix it , it was the (msg;) part that was killing it
When you say "not for beginners", do you mean beginners to programming? To python? To computer vision?
I basically copied some of it because i was stuck, but not before i fully understood what the code did (thats my policy, no copying before understanding) but the rest of it is mine and ill upload it soon
The only problem that I found with Spyder is the lack of support for PyQT5, it Sucks, but is not a deal breaker
while certainly possible (read rb from a file handle, write wb to another) I can't say I recommend it (yes I have done this myself). Instead, you should look at ffmpeg and see how much you can do with that.
The only Anaconda I know of is the RHEL graphical installer https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaconda_(installer)
*Note: I made the tool I'm about to recommend* I personally recommend [SnekChek](https://github.com/izunadevs/snekchek) This program was designed as All-In-One linter for stuff like flake8 and pylint, but also isort and yapf, or even vulture, pytest and automatically uploading to pypi. All tools (except pylint) are configured in a single file (`.snekrc`) and will work just fine. Furthermore, some fields that are intended to be kept private (like say, TWINE_USERNAME/TWINE_PASSWORD) can easily be configured in environment variables instead. I've been using it as linter that requires passing for a long time, and despite the main development having died out, it still works and any PRs made will be accepted. As for an example project that uses it, check out the repository itself. `.snekrc` contains the configuration for all the linters (`.pylintrc` is still separate due to the giant filesize) and `.travis.yml` to see just how easy it is to use.
Well, he might be coding mostly in Java and using simple python scripts for certain tasks. Jumping over to another heavyweight IDE just to write 5-10 lines of code instead of staying right where you are might be seen as an unnecessary hassle. + Download Size, constant updates etc.
&gt; x the Jupyter Notebooks bugs on Pycharm... You should check out their new jupyer notebook support which they included with 2019.1. It is rather nice.
Anyone know if I have to get a new premium license if I already have pycharm professional?

Yeah the variable explorer and inline plotting in the console are the big things keeping me on Spyder.
Yeah it's a shame, they achieved a lot of stuff that no other Python IDE did (like the variable explorer) but they have no funding and development basically stopped.
It's a Python and R distro. Installing it gives you Python, Jupyter, Matplotlib, Pandas, the Spyder IDE. Perhaps most importantly it has the conda package manager, which is like pip on steroids.
It seems to me that all the python implementations of ffmpeg are lacking in some sort of features. The most complete in terms of complex filtering lack the ability to play the files instead of simply exporting them. Having looked briefly into OpenCV it seems that it might be my best bet. Out of the box reads frames in numpy arrays so it might give me flexibility.
Impressive!
One of Python's strengths is its HUGE amount of supported and well-made third party libraries for basically anything you can think of. It might be worth learning Python without modules to do some basic stuff, but if you're going to anything more advanced, there'll be a handy module to help you with it.

I think your employer wasted their money. The only course I ever took on deep learning for computer vision was Stanford's CS231n which is online and free. I can't speak for any of the courses you took, but I was more than productive after about halfway through this.
I can‚Äôt get use to PyCharm. I‚Äôm so ‚Äúat home‚Äù with VCS. Is it worth committing to the jump? 
I wonder what this means for their option to install VSCode during the Anaconda setup process.
It can be nice not to have to declare types in Python, but this means that you often *do* have to manually track the types in some way since there's no compiler to notify you when you use a variable incorrectly because you forgot its type. Python's dynamic typing can feel like the best or the worst part of the language depending on what kind of program you're working on.
I bet that's step 2. Step 1 is show good faith, integrate anaconda, and gain users because anaconda is awesome. Step 2 is add pycharm to anaconda and gain users because pycharm is awesome. 
This, and some. I use IDEA ultimate because I often code in golang and python. Okay I could have both GoLand and PyCharm but having one icon, one set of settings, etc makes it that much easier. Frankly the experience is no worse than PyCharm, all the features are there (plus some extra) just at the cost of some Java buttons loitering.

If you enter the Python's Universe from the Data Science Gate, chances are extremely high that Anaconda is your ticket.
I can't say I disagree, I always feel like I'm more in control with Fortran, everything feels a bit more 'direct' or primitive. With Python I'm constantly checking the documentation to make sure it's doing what I want it to do.
Sounds very cool, will be checking this out
You might be interested in looking into [Code golfing](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/54/tips-for-golfing-in-python) instead. For example, we can write the Fibonacci function like this: def fib(n): if n &lt; 2: return 1 return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) ... Or like this: a=5**.5;fib=lambda p:round((.5+a/2)**p/a) It might not be very readable, but both should yield the same results.

How far has anaconda come? I‚Äôve not used it for 4 years since it destroyed my python installation
You need to wait a while.
I have stopped using IDE's. I think I learn more when I write all code by myself. I use python debugger (pdb) though. It's great!
It didn't destroy your python. You destroyed your python. 
Yeah I've been golfing for a few weeks but I thought that a final 40% size reduction could help. I'll send you the problem and what I came up with tomorrow and add you on discord if you want
It's pretty unlikely that you'll get much optimization. Base64 isn't meant for code compression, it's meant to be able to represent binary data in an ASCII or similar encoding. Perhaps you could compress with gzip and your script decompresses and execs, but not only is this a very bad practice, it's probably not in the nature of code golfing. Code golfing is about the smallest source code, the original code being executed. If you gzip, use base64, etc you are not making your source code smaller: your source code is still the same, but it's represented smaller. Now it does seem like your challenge isn't source code, it's just file size, so maybe gzip and exec would work. But I'd suggest to optimize your implementation before doing this
This seems more like an r/learnpython and r/learnjava question.
I assume that's the main target. People are using this default as one of the reasons why vscode is better for DS
Yes, but if you feel at home you can continue. They both have their nice parts and if you're familiar enough than it would likely take you some time to get up to the same speed.
How exactly do you not write your code when you use an IDE?
Prob gonna get down voted like hell but seriously vscode by far has been the best IDE ever. I don't get the point of PyCharm or Jetbrains ngl 
Please implement a gratifying clank sound!
It comes with a ton of data analysis packages by default, which can be useful if you're in an environment where you can download Anaconda but package managers are blocked. 
Cool. Thank you for your advice. :) 
You can compare audio using the same mechanism speech recognition is done. Here a library: https://github.com/michaelgundlach/pyspeech
Social media like 4chan &amp; reddit are the examples of how they stayed up even after criticism. 4chan is another example of their users being so reeetarded that it's almost a cult. Make something on that line? Forum like, but with a lot of user interaction. With video, image, easy emoji/gif upload etc. Integrate other services such as imgur like stackoverflow does to upload images. Gifphy can be used for gifs. Each user can have personal walls of images like instagram but others don't get bombarded with everyone's personal content. If you make it like fb/twitter, it becomes sort of professional because there is less anonymity of general users. Expression becomes limited because users start realizing everything they write/upload can be uses against them. So, when it starts becoming mainstream, it will eventually become shit &amp; fail or will be taken down. I think you get the idea.
Well you have to think, Cali is like the tech hub of the US. You can‚Äôt throw a rock out there without hitting a start up or something similar.
I still had numpy arrays and functions in the function I defined. My excuse is I was past the Ballmer Peak and it was late. It's running at about 500ms now.
Oh man, I really hope they come up with some sort of light weight and simple IDE. All the current IDEs just feel awkard to me.
Yes. It's running at about 500ms now.
Morally, you are generally in the *bad* side of things. Legally, people have been charged with crimes for less and also gotten away with more - so it entirely depends on factors mainly outside of your control. If your entire *intent* is to violate a ToS in the name of profit, you are most likely fucked. This post is likely potential proof of that, in fact. When it comes to using whatever you made as a business, it will not matter if *selenium is detectable.* It will instead matter that you are selling software that is *obviously* violating the ToS of a website. Basically, if you are gonna go profit on this, assume you will be doing it on the small scale behind the curtain. You will definitely not be doing it on a large scale as a major business opportunity. Additionally, there are a non-inconsequential number of cases where people are VERY boned (financially speaking) for doing exactly this - without even trying to profit. Tread carefully - especially now that you have posted proof that you know what you are doing is against the ToS and are potentially pursuing profiting off of that.
It was a hoodwink. I am *not* a bamboozler.
I still had numpy arrays and functions in the function I defined. My excuse is I was past the Ballmer Peak and it was late. It's running at about 500ms now.
flask. hands down. if the project gets complicated enough that you'd want to leverage django, you'll probably want a whole architecture overhaul anyway. ie api gateway, service mesh, etc.
Haha. The way you kept being coy about your ‚Äúsilly mistake‚Äù in all these comments made me think it was something either super embarrassing or super secret. Thanks for replying!
Generators for everything that would make it less hard coded. You say a few thousand lines so I assume this is where they want you to go. Maybe not trickery with compression?
Autocompletion?
I've not heard of Airflow before, I'll have to check it out.
Sometimes the path can get a little messed up on Windows, but with some simple changes, it's easy to make sure everything works. And the hasn't happened to me in a while.
Thanks for the suggestion, however it didn't help (nothing was marked for update). I'm going to reinstall the boto packages and see if maybe that shakes something loose.
I have code and pycharms at work and prefer code since it‚Äôs lighter weight and doesn‚Äôt annoy me all the time with misspellings in my variables and method names among other things. I know that can be turned off, but I didn‚Äôt have to try and find that setting in Code.
I think Code is the best thing MS has done in the last 10 years.
Figured it out. My best guess is that the boto\* versions in the yum repo may be incompatible with the version installed by `pip install awscli` (which is how awscli was originally installed on this box). When I did `yum update` it overwrote the pip-installed versions, which caused awscli to bomb. Maybe? Anyway, I forced a reinstall of botocore, boto3, and awscli, which resolved the problem. The `--ignore-installed` was actually the Rosetta Stone. `pip install botocore --force-reinstall --upgrade --ignore-installed` `pip install boto3 --force-reinstall --upgrade --ignore-installed` `pip install awscli --force-reinstall --upgrade --ignore-installed` If this is the case, then I'll have to be vigilant about watching for boto package changes when doing yum updates, and then reinstall via pip.
Thanks for the suggestion. But no, it's not. All I did was `data = requests.get("reddit.com/whatever")` `print(data)` And it outputs "Response 429"
Ok....? So a description would be nice
Kinda. You‚Äôll need to run in debug mode and add a breakpoint or else it‚Äôll just remove the variables after the code completes. I tend to use spyder when I‚Äôm either still exploring my data or working with large amounts of it. For more functional scripts with Qt5 and stuff, or for quicker coding, I use pycharm more often

So it does everything vscode does for free. For how much?! With a subscription model?! Yeah, no thanks
vscode = G.O.A.T.
Vim. Its what I use. 
I think I have good input on this. It really depends on what your job is, if that is where you plan to apply it. I happen to work at a job that relies heavily on excel. For many of the daily tasks I do, they are somewhat repetitive, go here, change date, update workbook, send data to x database. This is not all of my job but a good 2 hours is spent on these tasks. Those before me leveraged VBA to reduce the amount of time it takes to do these tasks and simplify it. Im still new to python, a few simple scripts that bull data or send it somewhere but nothing crazy. He main issue I have with excel is when you are importing 900,000 rows of data and handling it in excel it is slow, it bugs out, takes forever to load. The point is that excel isn‚Äôt meant for that. I‚Äôm an analyst on a trade floor, I don‚Äôt want to spend my time uploading prices for two hours a day. Python offers a more straightforward way to do it all. Most of the data services we have subscriptions to also have apis. Python offers a way to simplify the data pulls and pushes without have to do anything in the middle, not sayin that you can‚Äôt do that in excel, but this is just one way python may be used. My point is, look at what you want to be doing. If you are in finance and building financial models (and not like crazy quant simulation shit either) then excel and VBA are going to be something you spend a lot of time in. If you are doing something else that requires a general use programming language to automate tasks or do some more difficult analysis, python may be better suited. And if you just like learning shit then learn both. My honest opinion is that if you just focus on one for now, then if you decide you need the other, it will be a hell of a lot easier because you already know the principles. 
I love this! Very useful. Having someone do the leg work and give an un-endorsed review is such a big help for those of us who have been eyeing some of these courses for a while but don't want to feel like we picked wrong. Thanks OP!
Good job. If I can give you a small piece of advice - there are a *lot* of comments in that code. So much so that it breaks the flow of reading the code. Also a lot of the comments are describing *what* something is doing, and not *why*. This is probably a habit that you want to break early on. Keep up the good work.
Who will be judging the competition. Remember that you have to impress them more than your peers. If the judges are teachers I would come up with something that is relevant for their field.(get a list of questions together) For me something that is useful and unique is more impressive than creating your own version of something that is already available. 
I never really figured this out: Whats the difference between installing a package via pip and via conda? I've noticed that installing a 3rd party package via pip makes it available while using Jupyter notebook but the opposite doesnt seem to be true

aiohttp is kinda slower than other ASGI frameworks/libraries. Right now I'm using starlette for production apps, and it's been really nice.
Thats what we‚Äôre planning on adopting it for.
Yes, I also made the jump from VS code and it was very worth it. VS Code is still amazing for python with the right plugins, but Pycharm was built for it.
That‚Äôs true. I never really knew the giant differences until I left. A huge reason I took up learning python to get a better job to move back lol
you cant even add variable inspector in vs code. I rather use jupyter lab
lol you cant even add live variable inspector in vscode, how come it is the best IDE? It is just a glorified text editor. Even jupyter lab has much more features like variable inspector etc
nope. Jupyeterlab is far better
Hang on you do have a live variable inspector with the python extension in vscode. Also I don‚Äôt only code in python its very annoying to have to constantly switch especially for full stack applications. 
Lots of larger projects on Github...
I would still purchase some python books. I know you've probably been told that before but really they'll help you learn faster. 
I want to recreate a game I made a few years back on my old computer for a CS class final called "Frosty Saves Christmas."

Perhaps I'm being stupid here, but besides the vague "enhanced support for anaconda", what does the anaconda edition have that the normal professional edition doesn't?
I'll try to help, but I'm confused by your question. When you say reset, do you mean you want them to be empty dictionaries? Or do you want to "un-nest" them and put them in a list? Just to clarify
Hey thanks a lot - I added an edit
Also it don't want none unless you've got buns hun.
Few thousand lines of code but doesn‚Äôt know that encoding with base64 makes a string ~33% bigger... You don‚Äôt want encoding, you want compression like lzma.compress() What you‚Äôre attempting to do may be considered cheating as the code isn‚Äôt readable (and also you have a decent chance of breaking any imports) If you want to make the filesize smaller but keep the code readable, you want to do something called minifying. Minifying does stuff like change 4 space indentations to a single tab, remove unnecessary spaces, and replace variable names like reallyLongExampleExampleFunctionThatDoesStuff ‚Äî&gt; a() Your best bet at staying within the rules might be to write your code and debug in main.py but submit main.minified.py
lol jupyeterlab is a joke
It is never too old. I am 32 and learning; I am getting the hang of it pretty quickly tbh. Good luck! 
You might try looking for projects needing speed optimizations. It‚Äôd be more impressive and there are lots of good libraries with N^2 algorithms or higher.
No, but if you‚Äôre starting out, yes.
Lots of online resources for that. My favorite class I am taking right now is on codecademy.com. Easy to follow and lots of hands on work so you feel like you are learning and retaining it. Might take the full stack class on Udacity too since it covers python development for both the front and back end.
I would take a high res screenshot rather than rendering at the native resolution. VTK has a kitchen sink of options.
Not *authenticate into*, it's *authorize to do*. That characters sequence is a hash that says to server if your api request is allowed or not.
I‚Äôll have to check it out. I‚Äôm taking a beginner to expert course on udemy. Then diving into pandas since my current role as an analyst is very data analysis driven. I wish you luck!
Udemy is great and all I just didn‚Äôt like that the course did really force you to really do any work if you know what I mean. Codecademy at least makes me write up some code to find the correct solution before it lets me move on to the next lesson. I find that I need courses that make me do the work to keep me on track otherwise my mind will wonder off.
The api generates and/or saves the token, internally it knows who is the token holder, so it responds accordingly. Each token is unique.

Thank you
It's a nice package with prebuilt binaries of several non-python dependencies. You would need to use apt or whatever package manager to find and maybe build these yourself, and hope you got all the right versions. It's not just a bunch of stuff pip could do. &amp;#x200B;
 Try some of these: print(data.text) print(data.json()) print(data.content) http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/
I prefer the `typing.NamedTuple` over the collections namedtuple but the defaultdict is a favorite.
&gt; It didn't destroy your python. You destroyed your python. It's a valid point, why'd you guys down vote this. Precautions could have been taken, and failure to take those precautions is the user's fault. 
It's a "batteries included" solution especially for scientific computing, data science, etc. It includes a buttload of packages that the average Python dev will never touch, but that are indispensable to people who use Python based tools not necessarily devs. I don't use it myself. 
Thanks! Im not very good at commenting yet so ill try to improve it.
They're not really references in the same sense as JS, Ruby, PHP, etc. I can tell you don't really understand how Python works. You should read up on it.
This is especially true on windows where some python libraries have external dependencies on other libraries and those that are built from source. Pip on windows (without using the linux subsystem) can be a nightmare at times. 
Are you talking about **callback** functions? No, there is no difference. The only difference is how you use them. Typically, you call a function to get a result: number_of_pages = len(pages) A callback function is a function that you register with some object (usually a GUI widget), and that other object calls the callback function when some kind of event occurs. def callback(): print("You clicked the button") button.action = callback If you mean something else, please explain. 
Unlikely.
I'm guessing it's a branded version that will have all the actual changes folded into pro/community just like the education version
You do you. No matter what you want to code in, it's your right to enjoy it.
There are many differences actually; conda is also a virtual environment manager, conda tracks and installs non-python dependencies (see, e.g., the many versions of numpy), conda strictly enforces package version dependencies, pip doesn‚Äôt.
Mayavi seems to have a screenshot function, but I couldn't get it going. Seems like the documentation is a little bit on the thin side when it comes to examples. At this point, I'm just walking around blindfolded by feeling my way through with examples and tweaking them, since I don't have much experience programming. How do I do it using VTK? Using the same Boy's surface example, what line of code do I need to add to get a decent screenshot?

I am new to this programming language but hopping to get lots of interesting things to learn through it. I have knowledge of C and C++ and hope it will help me in learning Python more smoothly. I know that Python is of of the mostly used Programming language at present and is highly demanded at market. Any suggestion will be highly appreciated. Thank You
There is one on the github. Its a handler for the stdlib logging module which logs to a specified database
Not just on windows.

You might as well ask "why are their entire companies devoted to simply combining other peoples products into complete solutions that solve a customers problem. Why do the customers pay them for this when they could simply do this themselves". Why use Redhat or Ubuntu when you can just "git clone" the linux kernel, download gnu software, apache, et cetera and build it yourself? Anaconda does not exist to provide environments for school classes. It exists to provide an environment for folks doing real, complex work. The same way Redhat exists to provide services to their paying customers. The people who ride for free are just a side effect.
I use python for image and signal processing and just moved away from anaconda. It is very convenient in the beginning but solving environments with conda ended up taking too long once I had installed a few libraries. I also find more on pip than on conda and conda-forge. Also have had to reinstall conda twice due to conda not being able to update due to it wanting to uninstall something that it says it needs? I came to python from matlab and anaconda was great because it installed everything you needed for you. Whereas python back then was a pain to get started with (in my view). Now python comes with pip so getting started is super easy. 
What's wrong with good old `jupyter notebook`
Deque with the maxlen constructor argument makes a very nice sliding-window data structure.
That‚Äôs awesome. Thanks for sharing! There‚Äôs a ‚Äústarred‚Äù pun in there somewhere, but I‚Äôll leave it for someone else...
Beautiful 
Working on trying to get flask authentication with cognito using onelogin as an idp. Cognito isn't exactly being the most cooperative piece in this endeavor. 
Take a look at Flask-Login. That should provide everything you need. 
Good point. Without anaconda there's a lot more compiling to do, and all the bug potential (introduced by the badly decoupled separate library/include layer) isn't a problem if you have premium 24/7 support.
I hear you. I have both as well and prefer vscode as an editor in general, but sadly it feels like most of the python functionality is hacky at best in vscode while it's native in pycharm.
Anaconda is really more about conda. conda is a mix between a package manager like apt, and virtualenv. It allows python packages to depend on non-python binary packages. These dependencies can be baked into an environment file that can be instantiated on linux, windows or mac. An example is pytables. This was intended to alleviate the pain of building scientific packages like numpy or pytables in a time when it was challenging to get them working. Things are different now that there are good wheels available for most of these scientific packages now. If pipenv takes off then the only thing conda has going for it is the ability to install non-python packages, even tools like cmake.
Like, not using autocompletion sounds like you're trying to get typo bugs in your code. Hell, I sometimes write variables until the last letter and then still try to autocomplete it just to be on the safe side that my dyslexia didn't kick in again! 
You might be getting down voted because there is a community edition that is free. 
But wait, there's more: [You can also inspect numpy arrays and pandas dataframes.](https://i.imgur.com/TE0BSeO.png)
hehe thanks man
It's probably the most used module on all of the standard lib. The inconsistency with capitalization always annoys me though.
Python Certification is generally let others know you being certified to work on Python Language. Python being a simpler language than Java requiring lesser code writing is in most demand. Certification is basically from institutes who offer training. There can be 2 certifications Basic/Beginner Level Certification Advanced You must join the [**Best Python Training Institute in Noida**](http://pythonandmltrainingcourses.com/) for becoming an expert of python It's actually a certified course which simply means all the companies certify it, if they want to hire you. They train you as per industry standards and the certificate is provided. If you will not join any python certification course then it will take more time to understand the concepts of python and even finding the dream job. So, for doing Python you must join Python certification training and become a master of python in a few weeks.
Imagine this as small lcd screens hanging on a wall. 
Wow that seems a bit complicated for me but i'll be sure to look into it
The situation improved significantly in the last year since many packages are now shiped as wheels which include the required dependencies/dlls. I don't know in the situation about machine learning packages, but the scipy packages (numpy, scipy, matplotlib), which where a nightmare to install some years ago now just work out of the box.
This makes me think of Stephen Wolfram's idea around exploring computational spaces just as we would discover actual space. It is quite possible that somewhere, out there, these "generated" images might actually exist. The exploring of the computational space, in effect, being little different from faster than light travel.
1-Pycharm feels like a bloated text editor for most of my projects. I'm usually using Sublime or VSCode because most of PC features are just overkill for me. 2-VScode's plugin system is just so much better. 3-PC is not a generic Ide, it's taylored for Python but most people do not just write python code 24/7. I know it handles other files than just .py files but other Ide handle those files much better 
Another advantage of getting used to PyCharm is that, if you ever need to program in Java, you can very easily pick up IntelliJ, which is Jetbrains' fantastic Java IDE.
&gt;conda strictly enforces package version dependencies, pip doesn‚Äôt. Does this mean that conda makes sure that no version conflicts occur? And is installation via conda preferred over installation via pip? 
I would consider a function decorator `@pure` as the most Pythonic way to represent this if it is important to your code base. @pure could potentially validate or assert this fact with a wrapper depending how fancy/complex you want to get. You could confirm that the called function does not mutate input variables or global state, or even inspect its AST for impure function calls. It seems superfluous to modify the name. Many important standard library functions are pure functions are math functions or tests (`.startswith`).
You can use pip in conda env as well.
I can't just install things at work, so kind of have to make due. I spend most time in jupyter anyway. 
If space truly is infinite it‚Äôs inevitable that those images actually exist.
I don't do a lot of plotting but I'm pretty sure there are packages built on top of matplot lib (Bokeh? Seaborn?) that are specifically designed for interactivity and this sort of thing. You might check them out.
Check out Corey Schafer's Flask tutorial, he also explains this.
Not necessarily, no.
No it‚Äôs not. This is a common misconception. Being infinite in size and random isn‚Äôt a necessary condition to contain every different configuration inside. It‚Äôs like with pi, people say that because it is infinite it must contain every subsequence. A number that contains every subsequence like this is called a ‚Äònormal number‚Äô. Whether or not pi has this properly is not known.
Actually, it can be both. A simple approach is to have the server generate a random token, and internally associate it with the client. That token, then, is an *authentication* token, because it is proof of the identity of the client. Authorization, then, is performed by the server: given the proven identity of the client, the server checks its authorization rules to determine whether this particular client is allowed to do what they are requesting. However, it is also possible to encode authorization directly into a token, using cryptography. Here's how that works. First, the client authenticates against another service, and requests authorization for a particular action. That service determines whether the client is allowed to do what they requested, and if so, it creates a snippet of data that says "whoever holds this token is granted permission foobar". The service then cryptographically signs the data (using its private key), and the data + signature bundle becomes a token. The client then takes the token and goes to the actual server that it wants to talk to and hands it the token as proof of permission. The server can now check the validity of the token by verifying the signature against the other service's public key, making it impossible to fabricate the token, or modifying it to grant other permissions. If the token checks out, the server then grants the client permission; this is possible even without knowing the client's identity, provided the server trusts the authorization service enough to take their word for it. Since the token doesn't identify the client, it is not an authentication token, but it is an authorization token. Both of these have pros and cons to them. Authentication tokens have the downside that in order to share authorization between disjoint services (e.g. in a SSO scenario), they all have to talk to a central authorization service behind the scenes, and managing this can be tricky, practically impossible, or undesirable from an organizational point of view. Authorization tokens have the big disadvantage that they cannot be revoked, so additional protections must be introduced, and they must be scoped carefully (e.g., you may want to time-limit the validity of a token, and you may require additional proof from the client).
Anaconda does a lot of work ensuring compatibility between various packages and their dependencies. I don't know what it's like today (because I always use Anaconda) but it used to be really complicated to install things like Scipy and Numpy because they have very complicated dependency trees. Anaconda's packages just work. If you don't want all of it, you can install Miniconda, which just gives you the bare bones Python install but lets you use conda to effortlessly install anaconda packages that again are set up to just work out of the box.
And the performance gains for appending and popping makes deque awesome.
Trying to ensure purity in Python is essentially hopeless. Even a function as benign as this is impure: def notPure(a, b): return a + b Why? Because you can pass in values for `a` and / or `b` that overload addition in an impure fashion, and those effects infect the entire call chain (i.e., calling anything impure makes the caller impure too). Const-ness is practically impossible to guarantee for similar reasons. In order to have any hopes at all of making useful deductions about the purity and constness of things, you need to somehow restrict the range of possible inputs; and that "somehow" essentially boils down to type checking, one way or another (even if you do it in your head, or through conventions and a battery of unit tests). This isn't an academic concern btw.; I've been bitten by this many times, in production codebases. I haven't found a good solution though, other than "use a different language" - essentially, my conclusion here is that if you're going to roll with Python, then you have to accept that pretty much everything is potentially effectful and potentially mutable, any kind of reasoning about it is best thought of as implicitly prefixed with "probably" or "hopefully", and in order to increase certainty, you need to use extensive amounts of (automated) testing. Avoiding powerful abstractions also helps (at the expense of, well, being limited on the "making your life easier with abstractions" front).
Nothing‚Äôs wrong with classic jupyter notebook, just wish that this IDE had it for free ediion. 
Very cool! Also, the music got me ;)

&gt; Does this mean that conda makes sure that no version conflicts occur, whereas pip does not? Yes. Which is why, if you really clutter a conda environment, adding a new package can take some time to solve the dependencies. Should never be a problem if you use different environments for different things. Conda is a dependency resolver. It'll always give you an environment where everything works together (unless it is literally impossible). Sometimes that means you will have a slightly different version of a package. Pip doesnt do that. It checks, and if really things conflicts... it still install! So careful with pip. &gt; And is installation of packages via conda preferred over installation via pip? Yes, it is. But you can still install packages from pip (some packages aren't on conda), even in virtual environments. Since the last conda version, there is much better integration with pip packages. Can't explain how though, because it's beyond my level, but they have a blog page out there explaining how.
I need this as a wallpaper
They made it more vague, but there‚Äôs not clear to me they meant it to be less fast. What is significant to you?
in the worst case you generate all the plot then transform them into a gif/video
Use can use object serialization, python standard library already provides awesome [tool](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/pickle.html) for that
Take a look at the built-in `pickle` module which allows for serialization of Python objects. 
You probably want a test runner like [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) and an HTTP client like [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/).
What's the song name? 
No. They probably don't know about docker. 
There are a lot of libraries you can use for this. A unittest framework and the requests library. Might be worth having a look at the *Robot Framework*. Ig I am not mistaken they include examples which contain what you are talking about.
You can make animations in matplotlib but it's a bit painful, try plotly express for the simplest possible animation in python, makes since good looking stuff, with the option to customise. 
You can either use something like pickle or another way of serializing an object, or depending on your list contents it might make sense to save it as a csv file.
You definitely need to ask for permission. The data being publicly available doesn't mean it's publicly available for all uses and redistribution.
There are an infinite number of positive integers, but none of them are equal to -3.
You might want to look into [poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/) or [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) if you want something closer to the proper Yarn experience.
Thanks for that suggestion.
lol the community edition is shit
Bottom of the page: "If you have any questions about either the data or how it can be used for your own betting system, just contact [Football-Data](http://www.football-data.co.uk/contact.php)" &amp;#x200B; By all means scrape and use it privately, but I expect you'd potentially run into problems if you wanted to then re-distribute it.
To clarify: both of those tools actually keep an environment per project and a lockfile of all of your dependencies automatically, just like Yarn does, so they don't just interact with whatever the current environment is.
Alright, thanks!
Yeah, I saw that, but since I'm not using it commercially I thought I maybe wouldn't need it. But I will contact them!
They also do full code reviews so you do not risk supply chain attacks.
&gt;for my web development class https://i.imgur.com/96qWGwO.jpg
Another approach you might be able to take here would be to distribute the project but don't include any data directly in it, but instead provide a script that can download and populate the data. &amp;#x200B; (You're not redistributing it yourself, you don't need to think about how you'll keep it up to date, and other folks can always source alternative data sources at some other point in time)

Please please please make it easier to build conda packages. Currently it is an absolute nightmare to make packages with any dependencies beyond the default conda ones like Numpy, networkx etc. Trying to build a package at the moment with ~10 dependencies spread across ~6 different channels and it is torture.
&gt;Robot Framework Yeah, that looks like something I could use. Thanks!
social inertia, and for a while pip was a load of ass on windows so conda was the only sane way to get some packages
In addition to the other issues about this not being true of infinite things, it's not generally thought that space is infinite. Big Bang and relativity make it finite.
Pickle is not optimal for storing data but more for objects. What does your list contain? How about an sqlite db? Or plaintext files like csv? Advantage is you can then read only the part you're interested in, while with a pickle you would have to load the whole thing. 
It's on a small LCD screen clutched in my hand.
Sites like that almost always have terms of service etc, so have a look around the site. There are also all kinds of sport data APIs out there that you can use (some free, some paid), again with their own terms of use.
To be fair, if the organization only accepts .docx, it's already a red flag to not work there. 
I actually have to store nodes of a binary search tree. I said list like to sort of abstract away from it. I did consider a database but how would I store the tree? Row wise?
I thought about this, but reading only sections I want would be difficult right?

But is that more legal? To have a function in the module that downloads and reads data from this specific site? Wouldn't this be exactly the same?
Disclaimer, I never used conda, but I used enthought EDM, which is quite similar. conda is more like pipenv than pip. The other difference is that while the pip/pipenv packaging system is a mess, conda manages dependencies in a much smarter way guaranteeing that you never have an environment that is made of incompatible parts, _AND_ it manages beyond python wheel stuff, that is, it also manages compiled and versioned non-python libraries. Why? because if you have for example stuff like mayavi, and that depends on VTK, you have no guarantee about VTK. Is it installed on the machine you are deploying to? is it in the right path? is it ABI compatible? is it the correct/compatible version? There is a _massive_ amount of problems in producing a reliable installation of python software, and these tools are made to handle these problems.
I haven't found any free API with nearly as good data as this site.
planet caravan by black sabbath, i think it was the paranoid album.
If the token doesn't authenticate you, how do you authenticate? That needs to happen before authorization. I think the token authenticates you and then authorization happens on the server - just like if you had used username/password to authenticate. &amp;#x200B;
Oui, √ßa l'est :). As you provide only a tool to do something that is avaliable publicly, if somone use your tool for commercial used, that somone should discuss with company offering the data. The only think you should care of if it's OK, to scrape it. 
Anaconda manages Python versions for you. You can swap between versions with ease. This is very important when libraries are only available for a specific version of Python. For example, you install Python3.7, and then you need to use Python3.5 (TensorFlow for example isn't available for 3.7) . With Anaconda swapping between the version of Python is trivial.
It's each node of a binary search tree. But if the file gets super large like several hundred GB how would I solve this
Person who uses python but isn't really a dev here. Conda is a fucking lifesaver, I probably wouldn't be using python without it.
No token is used to "authenticate into api". There are authorization tokens used to allow permissions on some system parts and there are various authentication types needed to retrieve authorization token in the first place and to establish trusted interface to api.
 import hallucinate 
Any form of technology based job I have seen does not care a damn about certifications. Maybe in cyber security they like a couple but programming, no. It is the portfolio that shows it all. No degree. No nothing. They want to see proof of your coding abilities and what you can do. Hell, some placing hiring will toss a printed copy of code, tell you what it should do, and then state, "find the error(s)." And walk away. 
If space is infinite and every sort of configuration of stars is possible, then this is the most powerful telescope ever built. PS: I'm completely aware space is finite. Just sayin.
You probably don't want to hear this, but the capitalisation is perfectly consistent. Defaultdict is written in c so not capitalized; OrderedDict is written in python so PascalCase. 
Python 2 will soon be gone so you should have very good reasoning to step back instead of stepping up imo. 
It's an old unix server.
Should I then have some kind of disclaimer about this? I mean, I wouldn't even think about legal issues if I got my data through an open source module. I guess I have to tell the user that I'm actually scraping a website and which website? Regarding scraping, shouldn't this be handled in robots.txt? `# All robots will spider the domain` `User-agent: *` `Disallow:`
There are a handful of gotchas, but unless you're doing a lot of asynchronous programming, you'll be fine. Consider upgrading the python version on the server, if possible.
TIL. Thank you
I don‚Äôt have headphones and I‚Äôm in a loud environment, so I was wondering what it would be. That‚Äôs such an appropriate song for this.

Mostly running scripts to ease my work and stuff. What's "gotchas"?
r/interestingasfuck
You could use file handles in cython, using the overloading approach to only read from disk. Just store it as a big array and use fseek to navigate. Let the OS handle getting efficient accesses right. If you know how big each node can be you can directly jump to any node, its parent, or its children.
Ur phone has LCD?
Mock it. You don't make calls to an external API in tests, you mock it. You mock I/O too, to keep your tests fast. You do the same - mocking- with what you're expecting with your interactions with a database. You aren't testing the database, you are testing your code handles what is retrieved from the (mock) database or what the database would respond with if your insert good data, bad data eg breaks constraints, etc. No tear down, in memory mocks make testing faster, safer, more maintainable.
Yeah, pickle only allows to read whole objects, so if you store everything as a list, you'll have to load the whole list...
That is not a reason to not switch in TEN years since python 3 is out. At the end of the year, python 2 is dead.
Good questions, thanks for asking. Calling by string / task-name -- definitely do-able. Your application's "huey" instance has a registry (huey._registry) which records task name -&gt; callable. So one way you could do it would be to write a wrapper that takes the string, looks it up in the registry, and obtains the callable in that manner. Another would be to use Django's "import" helpers and just resolve the module paths in that way. To abort a pipeline, just raise an exception in the task and subsequent tasks in the pipeline will not be executed. Similarly, any task in the pipeline can be revoked, which will also halt processing. Unhandled errors raised by tasks within a pipeline are handled by [defining an error handler task callback](https://huey.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#Task.error). For monitoring you have a few options. Huey logs unhandled errors at the ERROR level (including traceback), so you can attach a handler to that logger that emails you or whatever. Or you can register a [signal handler](https://huey.readthedocs.io/en/latest/signals.html) for the SIGNAL_ERROR which will be called when a task fails with an unhandled exception. I'm not sure I understand the last question about bulk processing.
It's worth taking some time to learn what's in the standard library. [The Python 3 Standard Library By Example](https://doughellmann.com/blog/the-python-3-standard-library-by-example/) is a handy resource.

I don't think there will be any major problems, other than you really wishing you were using Python 3. Some syntax is different, some things are done in dumb ways (see differences between input() and raw_input() and how unintuitive that mess is, xranges, etc.). Good luck to you. :) FYI, Python 2 is losing support by the end of this year, I believe. You should see if you can get your office to use Python 3 :)

Hi, 0% knowledge of Python here and I have a question, it may be pathetic but I'll ask it anyway &amp;#x200B; Is it possible to build a whole OS (Operating System) like Windows, Linux etc... just from Python? If yes, is it worth it?
It‚Äôs a convenient way to install and use Jupyter Notebooks for developing Interactive Python programs in the browser with libraries others have mentioned. You can mix code, graphics, plots, text, etc. with ease. Think Google Docs, but can run Python inside them. 
The universe is infinite. What is finite is the _observable_ universe, everything beyond that is not observable to that because light (or any other form of information) from there has not yet had time to reach us since the Big Bang.
&gt; What is Anaconda? It's a python distribution that includes a bunch of data science packages out of the box and its own package manager (i.e. conda). Most critically it bundles all of the library dependencies for the packages it installs (even on operating systems where that is a patently moronic thing to do like OSX and Linux) So if it's not clear yet, Anaconda has NEVER made sense on OSX or Linux to me. It kind of made sense on windows for a while prior to binary dependencies being allowed in wheels in pypi (i.e. when it was more of a pain in the ass to gather up all the dependencies for each package manually than to deal with the idiosyncrasies of conda). Now that binary windows wheels can include dependencies it's completely superfluous (IMHO). The only redeeming quality left is that their packages include the intel mkl out of the box, which is a very convenient shortcut if you use functions accelerated by that library over free libraries (and can't figure out how to roll your own). But since a bunch of people got hooked on its workflow over the years it's persisted as the defacto python distribution and package manager for many people. So the advice I always give people is that if you have no explicit reason to use anaconda (i.e. you aren't already somehow mentally locked into its workflow), just get the official python build (from python.org, brew/source on OSX, or your distro package manager/source on linux). Then simply use pip and virtualenv as intended. ----- TL;DR Anaconda is a relic from when wheels were garbage on windows (which is no longer true). It's persistence is entirely a symptom of the fact that an absurd fraction of python "programmers" don't actually understand python packaging or virtual environments (which is completely understandable, it's been a bit of a mess and there really are no good comprehensive resources I've found). If your gateway into the python world was installing anaconda and using conda to manage everything, your world view of the python packaging ecosystem is probably a little warped.
I'm confused. Isn't that just for static typechecking? Won't you still have to use the collections.namedtuple?
Why one should use poetry? (also I think that the packaging situation with python is pathetic, but that's a topic for another time)
Pycharm community absolutely supports notebooks
Nah you can do it in community too. That said, I occasionally run into issues displaying pandas dataframes
If it's several hundred GB, you want to use a B tree, not a binary tree.
Oh, gotchas are small details to watch out for. In this case, things like: 1) string literals are not Unicode by default, 2) print is a statement like raise instead of a function, 3) integer division doesn't upcast to float, so you have to do eg 1/float(3) I'm confident that you would be able to proceed as if you're writing python 3 (except async) and the errors you get would be sufficient to correct yourself.
Ah, I'm dealing with some data that has this sort of structure. That's why I finally came to this data structure.
11 Hours, you say? To Shreds, you say? &amp;#x200B;
What language the underlying code is written in is an implementation detail that could change at any moment, not something to base naming conventions on. https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2009-March/086646.html
Like a regular schema for each entry?
Yeah, there's a domain specific data set that sort of fits the definition of a binary search tree. And I was wondering if I could cache it like such. I didn't even know it was like a binary search tree until someone pointed it out.
IRC on #pypy or a mail to the pypy-dev mailing list.
What if each node is serialized separately? How would I store that?
Seriously, just create a database table and index it on the field in question. The index is a B-tree, which is like a binary tree but optimized to work with having to make multiple reads from a potentially large file.
This looks pretty good Serpent!
Thank you, this answers my question! I will probably just stick to not using Anaconda then.
I would agree with this very much, if Django did not already provide an excellent interface for dealing with test using the database. Plus, to some degree, aren't you testing your mock?
I never used Jupyter Notebooks, but that is good to know. I typically use Atom with the Teletype addon and Github. Together those work great for group projects. Thank you!
The typing NamedTuple is actually the typed version of the collections namedtuple. I like its syntax more especially for the type hinting of the fields and the default values. And the way with the class definition (like Enums and dataclasses etc.) reads nicer to me compared to the stringly named one liners that you usually find in namedtuple definitions. Chech out https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.NamedTuple 
Thank you! I actually plan on using either TensorFlow or Pytorch later for one of my research projects, so this is really nice to know.
That's a very impressive Turtle app! Good job! &amp;#x200B;
I'm confused by what you mean when you say it protects against supply chain attacks. Could you explain further?
&gt;also I think that the packaging situation with python is pathetic Because of that. You can think of Poetry as npm for Javascript or cargo for Rust. It get rid of the setup.py and replace it with a pyproyect.toml file. And you only need one command to publish a package. 
I typically find myself browsing StackOverflow to find answers to my bugs. It works pretty well for working on individual projects, however, I can see how having 24/7 support would be useful for a company.
Why small? Large would be much more awesome :-)
Well, no. If there were infinite mass and space to fit it, then the probability that as t approaches infinity any given configuration appears will approach 1. But it's not a guarantee, it's just the monkey with a typewriter thing.

You are mostly right; adequate tests are OK, regardless of how you achieve that. You are wrong on two important things though: &gt; Tests aren't part of our application. &gt; If your tests are adequately **testing your code**, they aren't written incorrectly. (emphasis mine) So what's wrong about these? Well; testing the code (as in, running it to make sure its behavior matches the spec) is only one of the things tests are for, and the other things are actually more important. Automated tests serve the following purposes: - define the desired behavior of the application, or a part of it, in an unforgiving, unambiguous language - document the implemented behavior - verify that the actual behavior matches the defined spec (this is the "testing your code" part) - signal regressions (i.e., when some part of the codebase changes and accidentally violates assumptions made elsewhere in its dependency graph, then one of your existing tests should fail) - isolate the source of a bug / regression (i.e., when you notice that the application as a whole fails, the unit test failures should lead you to the culprit, and if not, you should add unit tests that help you rule out all the possible candidates but one) And in pretty much all of these roles, your test suite is very much a part of the application, together with your other documentation, deployment scripts, getting-started-guides, dependency lists, virtualenv setups, and what have you. Regarding the database thing: spinning up an actual database for your tests is important for end-to-end testing (i.e., testing the application as a whole), which is a type of test mostly focused on detecting bugs and regressions, defining the application's behavior at the "user story" / "observable functionality" level, and verifying at a per-feature scope. These tests are important, maybe the most important ones you have, but in a properly test-covered codebase, they often form a small majority of all test cases, and you don't actually run them very often (typically just before deploying, or as part of your nightly builds, or when integrating a feature branch, or something like that). On the other side, you have your unit tests: tests that define the behavior of individual parts of the codebase. Here, the focus is on isolating behavior, defining the behavior of components in isolation, at their interface boundaries - that is, each test ideally exercises one aspect of the unit it targets, **AND NOTHING ELSE**. No other units, and certainly not the database (unless the database is the thing you're unit-testing). Instead, you provide a "mock object": an object that exposes the same interface as your database, but does only the absolute bare minimum that is required to implement the test. To mock a database access layer, you can suffice with "chat scripts": tell the mock database what queries it should expect to receive (or, slightly fancier, which properties should hold for the queries or method calls it receives), and which results to return. If it receives an unexpected query, fail the test. (Or, alternatively, just make the mock database log method calls, and assert the desired properties of that log after the fact). Because no actual I/O happens, nothing needs to be set up or torn down, the test runs blazingly fast, and there are no outside factors that could mess with the experiment and cause false positives or false negatives (e.g., if you use a real database, it could be in an unexpected state from previous test runs, causing a test to fail with which absolutely nothing is wrong). You want your test suite to answer not just "can you find any bugs?", but also "where are those bugs?", "how am I supposed to use this particular function here?", "what are the invariants of that object?", "will anything break if I make this change?".
Cool, I'm glad someone made a video for the Arduino folks. I discovered MicroPython quite some time ago, and haven't looked back since.

String encoding and integer division are going to be two general gotchas. Make sure to `from future import division` and invest some time learning about how python2 inadequately auto-handles string encoding. 
Ah ffs I know it is exactly the monkey with the typewriter thing. And I was joking. Hence the PS. Also what is your t?
I thought pipenv was npm. Also, I thought that the toml file (ah yes, yet another file format, as we didn't have enough of them already) was to specify that you wanted to use poetry (rather than... what? setuptools?), not to configure poetry. So where does this leave us? how does one create a package on python? What's the one way to do it? 
if you've got infinitely many values distributed between 1.0 and 2.0 though, and you discover that 1.6 occurs 0 times over that infinite set, it becomes worth examining right

It‚Äôs just that I think anaconda is fundamentally flawed. It brings its own shared libraries (\`.so\`/\`.dll\`/\`.dylib\`), but doesn‚Äôt completely separate itself from the host system. So inevitably, you‚Äôll end up compiling something against some host system libraries and some anaconda libraries and after an update you have a mess and no idea why it‚Äôs breaking with random segfaults suddenly.

What framework are you using? You can create a route and then bind a button to an href or call it via javascript.
what is your tts source?
Flask. but do I do create that JavaScript route?
Those numbers are diminishing significantly though, right?
Thanks!
Not really, why would it?
Yea that's correct (about version conflicts). I think the second question depends on the type of work you do. I prefer conda usually, but it can be slower. You can also use `pip` within conda environments, and it generally works well.
You could try flask's jsonify for ajax calls

Not really, the set `[1.0, 1.5] U [1.7, 2.0]` also has infinite values; its maximum is 2 and its minimum is 1; and it does not contain 1.6. The size of a set has ***no*** effect on its contents. "Infinite" or "unbounded" or "uncountable" are only ways to describe the size of a set. Those words do not describe the set's contents. Ever.
I am pretty sure only the flagship/highest end phones use AMOLED. As the technology becomes more affordable more manus will switch to it but for now LCD is still the predominant tech. For example, Apple currently only uses OLED tech in the iPhone X, all prior models have LCD displays.
I do use IntelliJ but since I‚Äôm new to Java so I had no issues of using it. All my java stuff is for school but I use python for work and home. Think I‚Äôll just use PyCharm whenever I start a new project to give it a fair chance! I did see it had a database button. Wonder if it‚Äôll work for sqlite3. That would be pretty neat. ^_^ I do prefer VSC theming :3 
Any tutorial relating to this?

because we're talking about star distribution and we want to know why stars are distributed the way that they are?
Okay... I guess I didn't really word myself well? I mean you build the set of your data in physics by examining the world, but then you compare to your expectations: if you're expecting that any hypothetical abstract value between 1.0 and 2.0 is a possibility, and then you run a trillion experiments and you find out that actually, any value within that range except 1.6 seems to be within the realm of things we're finding, that's something that bears examination.
Thanks for the reply. Sounds pretty promising. &amp;#x200B; Two follow ups: &amp;#x200B; \- If you abort a pipeline, what happens to all the other tasks in the pipeline? They stay on the queue? I guess the way to handle that is to revoke those as well, then as part of the error exception handling? &amp;#x200B; \- Let me try again with the bulk question. Say I have a million items that need processing. I don't want to put a million items on my queue all at once because that'll use a ton of memory. Instead, I want to somehow monitor the length of the queue and keep it loaded with a few dozen items (or so), and then have a long running process that enqueues items as the queue gets too short. We have a class called a CeleryThrottle that we've developed for this purpose. Every time we loop over the million items we call throttle.maybe\_wait() before enqueueing more items, and it either sleeps a few seconds (determined by current, measured rate of processing) or it enqueues another item. &amp;#x200B; Monitoring sounds tough. I guess we only use email now, but it'd be really nice to have something better, that could send alerts based on increased error rates. I suppose that's on me to build. Maybe prometheus could do the trick. Hm.
You should always work with virtual environments "virtualenv" this will keep your system clean and your projects separate. Also you should consider an ide, PyCharm or Visual Studio Code would be my recommendations.
Not really because it depends entirely on the probability assigned to each number. For a uniform distribution over an interval every individual number has probability 0. 
I think we‚Äôre not communicating very well. I didn‚Äôt realise your question was even about stars.

&gt; - If you abort a pipeline, what happens to all the other tasks in the pipeline? They stay on the queue? I guess the way to handle that is to revoke those as well, then as part of the error exception handling? The pipeline is not enqueued all at once, but serially. The main use-case for a pipeline is to use the task queue to process things in a particular order. So a task is executed -- if it succeeds, then the next task in the pipeline is enqueued. If it fails, then the error handling task (if it exists) is enqueued. &gt; ... bulk ... Sounds like you would be fine just using multiprocess.Pool or something? You just trying to saturate your cpus by running a bunch of tasks in parallel, there's xargs / parallel. &gt; Monitoring... Email is easy, just attach a handler -- python logging has an SMTPHandler built-in. Equally easy is to add a signal-handler for the SIGNAL_ERROR that talks to some metric service. Lots of tooling out there for this kind of thing, huey should be "open" enough to allow you to add whatever you need. If not, then feel free to create a ticket on GH.

Why are you learning Python 2? It will no [longer be supported after 2020](https://pythonclock.org/) . 
There are a few Coursera courses that I found helpful when first learning python. They're free of you audit them. Some are oriented more toward data analysis, so you might look for those.
Trying to implement Gaussian Process to fit transit functions to light curves.

They are, but you'd be surprised how many are still on LCD's. Particularly because of Apple being slow as fuck in upgrading.
I dunno, I don't use JupyterLab but I know it aims to capture a similar type of experience. You can read through the GitHub issue regarding a variable explorer, I didn't read through it but there might be plugins/extensions that enable it: https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/443

I've found Poetry to be closer to Yarn, including having separate `add` `install` commands. Poetry is typically faster for most operations because Pipenv does its own hashing. I did a quick comparison of the tools in a blog post you could find in my post history. Poetry also has a comparison to Pipenv in its README.

Do not add code directly without any indentation to [quiz.py](https://quiz.py) as that causes them to run upon import. If your quiz has code like: &amp;#x200B; playerscore = 0 x = 0 while True: if x &gt; 0: playerscore += 1 \# rest of code &amp;#x200B; you should refactor that like: &amp;#x200B; \# at the top of the [quiz.py](https://quiz.py) playerscore = 0 ... \# at the end of the [quiz.py](https://quiz.py) if \_\_name\_\_ == "\_\_main\_\_": x = 0 while True: if x &gt; 0: playerscore += 1 \# rest of code &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;

I honestly think people should just standardize on pipenv at this point. It was buggy and had a rough start, mostly because PyPI was pushing it as an official thing before it was really production-ready, but it seems pretty production-ready now. I've been using it for months without issue.
Hmm. I much prefer using poetry to pipenv. It has a more robust dependency solver, and it feels better for library development than pipenv. I'm not saying it should replace pipenv, just that it is also a good option.

I would rather be using pure pip, as anaconda doesn't integrate with poetry, my preferred packaging tool. However, conda provides binaries for numeric packages that are compiled with Intel mkl, which are much faster than the standard wheels on pip. Additionally, conda supports non python dependency management, which is vital for scientific / numeric work. Before I was doing research however, I had no need for these things, and consequently never used conda. 
End to end tests require the database. If that is what you mean by 'tests' then yes. However, the bulk of your tests shoudl be unit level, not anything that interfaces with external components. It may be worth reading about the [practical test pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html)
if the universe is practical infinite then shouldn't all of these exist *somewhere?* 
I agree that it's kind of obnoxious for a testing framework to fail if you don't follow a best practice unrelated to the test. But it's still a best practice.
It should let you do it. But you shouldn't do it.
You can store the running total as a global variable outside of the scope of your gambling function - this way, it persists across function calls. This is generally a bad idea, but given the simplicity of your program it will get the job done. Another way to accomplish this goal is to pass the running total as a function argument. For example, your function header could be written as "def gamble(z = 0):". In Python, defining a variable in the function definition means that if it isn't specified, it will be initialized to the default value on the right side (in this case, 0). When you call your function for the first time the running total will be empty, but when you recurse within your function by calling gamble again, you can pass the current winnings as an argument (e.g. gamble(z = ??)). All that's left is to update the total value within the function itself. Perhaps you can use the += operator which increments the value of a variable by the right hand value. Have fun! Let me know if you have any questions.
thanks for the prompt response, I tried it and it still didnt work. to clarify I have to put the if \_\_name == "\_\_main\_\_": at the end of my quiz code correct?, and define playerscore as 0 at the top of the quiz. do i have to do anything to the menu or can i keep my from quiz import playerscore
Keep it, that's the intention. Let's try this way: 1) open [quiz.py](https://quiz.py) in your editor and select all (Ctrl+A) 2) press Tab on keyboard 3) go on the top of the file and add the line `if __name__ == "__main__":` 4) add the line at the very top `playerscore = 0` &amp;#x200B; So your code was like: abcd efgh ijkl mnop qrst and now it's: playerscore = 0 if __name__ == "__main__": abcd efgh ijkl mnop qrst &amp;#x200B;
Pipenv has a variety of problems, from use in non-user contexts due to the reliance on click, to the author's weird distinction between the concept of a Python application and a Python library even though many times they exist together one and the same, to the slow resolver, and more, specifically to the author being a complete and total dick to the entirety of this subreddit and then not only refusing to apologize, but tossing all responsibility aside to "being bipolar made me do it".

Thank you kindly for your help. It is really appreciated. It works now!
&gt;The pipeline is not enqueued all at once, but serially. Oh wow, doesn't that mean you lose the ability to make pipelines asynchronous? I.e., if you have a pipeline with two tasks, you can't let your code move past it until at least the first task is completed? Is this right: task1 = my_task() # Takes 30s pipeline.enqueue('task1', depends_on=task1) return Response() # &lt;-- This won't run for ~30s? &gt;Sounds like you would be fine just using multiprocess.Pool or something? Sorta. The nice thing about using a task queue for this is that you get the API of pipelines and of tasks, and you can run the tasks in a distributed fashion across numerous workers on numerous machines. And it's a system that's already in place (unlike Hadoop or something, that we don't have). &amp;#x200B; Sorry and one other question, if you don't mind a late addition (I know I'm asking a lot and I appreciate your time). What happens to tasks in the queue (or in process) when the workers are shutdown cleanly? Does the worker wait for them to finish? Does it kill them and resume them again after? Do they get error conditions and need manual intervention? In a docker world, I'm expecting our workers to be pretty transient for better or worse. &amp;#x200B; Thanks for all the responses. Super impressive system and I'm enjoying a lot of things about it. &amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôve been following r/python for a long time just because I‚Äôve been really interested in learning it and I knew seeing various posts would inspire me.

Without knowing the specifics it'd be hard to suggest how to model it on a SQL DB. But there are DBs optimized for graph work, see [https://neo4j.com/](https://neo4j.com/)
**TL;DR** The decoration happens post-creation (i.e. after the class/function has been defined) --- **Explanation** The order of opcodes for functions is as follows: LOAD_NAME(0) # co_names[0] is the decorator name LOAD_CONST(0) # co_consts[0] is the `code` object for the function body LOAD_CONST(1) # co_consts[1] is the name of the function MAKE_FUNCTION # function gets created with the name and code, and gets put on the stack # keep in mind, the stack is now [DECORATOR, OUR_FUNCTION] CALL_FUNCTION # This calls the decorator and wraps our function Note that if your decorator takes arguments (e.g. @mything(10)) it will evaluate that call BEFORE creating the function, but wrapping will still happen AFTER function creation.

Biologist here as well, working as software dev for the past 6 years (3rd job, couldn't be happier). Nobody has asked for certifications so far. Employers have loved the biology background. I've only had to pass interviews and challenges to get the jobs.

.remove has to iterate over map.living_bots again. Instead what you can do is use `for i, bot in enumerate(map.living_bots)` and use `del map.living_bots[i]` instead. 
You could probably use Map.living_bots = [bot for bot in map.living_bots if not (bot.life and bot.hunger &lt; 0)]
Yeah no worries. Supply chain attacks have happened in the Python ecosystem (npm is much worse for this). Imagine a popular project is taken over by some seemingly supportive developer. It goes like this: We get exhausted working on open source stuff, so someone gets to know you online and seems like a friend. They contribute to your project and in time offer to take it off your hands. Then, one day they enter a seemingly simple update to the project that sniffs for credit cards or mines crypto. So, Anaconda reviews the code for each package they add to ensure repeatable results and no one has place nefarious code into an otherwise useful package. It says it right on their main page. They brag about it all to time in interviews and things too: ‚ÄúSecure open source supply chains with a private package repository.‚Äù Hope that makes sense. Peter Wang talks about it on Talk Python too: [https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/198/catching-up-with-the-anaconda-distribution](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/198/catching-up-with-the-anaconda-distribution) 
Did you have trouble mapping hits from China?

That's amazing. The data is rasterised to ~160x160 km squares, so your actual location should be hidden.

I think it would interesting to see time of day as well. Not sure if it would work but you may see a wave as it traverses the timezones.
Perhaps you could look at excluding areas in the sea i.e. The English Channel, between France and England which looks like one of the 'hot spots' 
Yes. An animation with each dot popping out as the clock runs on screen. Don't know how hard that would be with python, I'm just a newb.
In what situations do you need to create a sliding window?
There's only 24 hours in a day may e a different color for each hour rather then a rolling view. 
Ya, that would probably work and be much easier to implement. I'd bet you'd still get a good sense of it rolling across the planet.

Is that using geoip from your access logs or are you collecting GPS coordinates?
Would it make sense for living bots to be a set rather than a list? Does order really matter? Removing from a set is O(1).
Sure but what is important is the percent English speakers, in which case all of Europe is higher than India (except Russia)
South Korea loved it! North Korea not so much.
I think you might have a different idea of what pipeline means than how it's used in this project. A pipeline is a pipe. The result of one task is fed to the next task, etc. Pipelines express a sequence of operations, one feeding into the next. If you just want to run tasks asynchronously, Huey already does all that. Regarding shutdown behavior, it's all documented.
Seems like I may have a different idea. In celery a whole pipeline operates like that, but it all gets enqueued at the same time. The idea is to send a pipe of tasks to the queue all at once. When each task finishes, gets the results and is already queued up to go.

You have a point in what could be Punta Arenas, Chile. I wonder if that‚Äôs an American down for deployment to Antarctica with the US Antarctic Program...
This seems unrelated to Python.
Looking at the code, he's getting the IPs from a log file and using the Python package geolite2 to get the latitude/longitude from the IP.
Yes, python can interface with an arduino using the USB serial port and [pyserial](https://pythonhosted.org/pyserial/). You can use [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to draw nice plots if required. If you have any questions about using python, you should ask them in the /r/learnpython subreddit.

That comparison is invalid. You want `item_wanted == "Food" `. Also, please ask these questions over at /r/learnpython next time
Probably a crash as the if and else don't line up
It'll print out each number in numbers. The else is lined up with the for loop, so once the 2nd for loop doesn't do anything, it'll print numbers[index] since else also works with for, not just if.
It's not an invalid comparison. It's just not what OP wanted.

You should avoid modifying the sequence while you are iterating over it. The best solution is the one posted by Query42, in which a list comprehension iterates over the `map.living_bots` sequence and produces a new list. You may find that you need to do slice assignment, as in: map.living_bots[:] = [bot for bot in map.living_bots if not(bot.life and bot.hunger &lt;= 0)] This will not assign a new list to the `living_bots` attribute, but will instead replace the content of the existing list.
This is a for-else, which is a thing in Python.

&gt; It's a "batteries included" I actually don't like that :P. I use Miniconda over Anaconda -- Anaconda is the one that comes will all that stuff that you probably won't need. Miniconda is just the basic Conda package manager + Python (the leaner version). The reason why I like Conda is that historically it was a better alternative to PIP, because they provided binaries that were easier to install (compiling installing SciPy and NumPy from source was historically painful). The other advantage is that it also makes sure you install compatible versions of the packages resolving dependencies reliably. On top of that, it also lets you easily create virtual environments. What's also nice is that it doesn't clutter your computer, because everything is installed in a (by default) ~/Miniconda3 folder, with an ./env subfolder for your virtual environments. If you don't want/need it anymore, simply move it to the trash.

Flask and SQLalchemy make it pretty easy to prototype a backend so that would be my choice - flask really just lets you write python and gets out of your way IMO. The downside to Flask is that eventually you‚Äôll need most of the features that Django has included so you‚Äôll either have to roll your own solutions or find existing libraries (which is possible, flask has an active community). However, most projects never get that far. If you do choose Django, check out Django rest framework - it‚Äôs great for building REST APIs. 
I just had an issue related to this and they're looking against mkl from the conda defaults channel for Windows at least, because they don't have scipy on Windows with openblas yet.

I did not know you could extract location from an ip-addres. You might use this information to figure out the optimal time for posting.
The advice is generally to not use your system python, so why would you want your various development environments, which might depend on different versions of non-python libraries, to depend on your system installed version? What about ABI incompatibilities from different compiler versions? What about tracking and resolving shared dependencies which would get bundled in each wheel that shares the dependency with no means of tracking them? Would you propose using pipenv or poetry to provide a dependency solver to complement pip, since it lacks the ability to ensure a consistent environment? Do you propose using tools like pyenv (I think?) to handle dealing with lots of python versions? I submit that using conda is an elegant alternative to the collection of pip-related tools that still don't solve all the problems conda is trying to. A close look at everything conda-forge is doing shows that it is a very ambitious and fruitful endeavor to act as a cross platform package manager that resolves dependencies across not just python packages, and python versions, but also the compiler compatibility settings, and versions of those non-python dependencies. Just the build machinery and testing architecture of conda-forge is fairly brilliant and a worthwhile solution in the general packaging problem space.
I recently discovered that Brian Okken's "Test &amp; Code" podcast has tons of non-testing content and should be in the same lists as Python Bytes and Talk Python to Me. I see it got mentioned above, I just wanted to give a shout-out since I've only recently realized I shouldn't ignore it - just ignore some episodes...
It offers a similar feature by connecting to a Jupyter server yes

shapely and freecad for me are actually in conda but not pip due to distribution challenges. It's notable that shapely is a dependency of geopandas which appears quite popular for whenever your data science stuff deals in geography/mapping. I think there are a number of small scientific package ecosystems for which conda is recommended. Biology, geology, oceanography and meteorology come to mind ... I know there's even a bioconda where they maintain a separate channel I think. You can get weird issues where multiple libraries depend on a finicky dependency like CGAL and you have to make sure they play nice and can all depend on the same version. With wheels you either have each library vendoring their version, you, the user installing/compiling it, or you let the small army of conda recipe maintainers at Anaconda or conda-forge deal with it.

It's often called "GeoIP". IPs are usually allocated to certain networks, and the location of those networks is often known or approximated from whois information, ping triangulation and other techniques. It's not always very precise, for example, when dynamic IPs are re-assigned in a large networks. It's the same technique used by ~~porn sites to show "women near you"~~ weather sites to show the weather at your location.

I didn't find any benchmarks, and so far have not had the time to do them by myself. I found the following sentence in the documentation: It should be noted that the Numba typed dictionary is implemented using the same algorithm as the CPython 3.7 dictionary. As a consequence, the typed dictionary is ordered and has the same collision resolution as the CPython implementation. So I would guess that the actual dictionary construction speed will be similar, although the typical Python overhead will be missing within the jitted function.
How much are you paying per 1000 words? 
Let me know if I'm misunderstanding your question, but it looks like the number of points that are used to construct the curve is defined by the number of points you give it. This then returns an object, which you can use to evaluate (using the __call__ method listed at the bottom) the curve at any x or at an array of xs, like so: curve = scipy.interpolate.Piecewise.Polynomial(x,y,...) result = curve(new_x) #evaluates the curve at new_x

Lists are passed by reference - that means, Python does not create a copy of the list you pass in the function, so all operations you execute on the list, will be applied regardless of the scope! This is not a bug, this is intended behavior, and perfectly fine!

With Huey enqueueing a pipeline returns a result group, which encapsulates a list of results for the individual steps. The result from each step is available as soon as it's computed. So I think Huey works how you'd expect.
No it's probably that the GeoIP database that the OP used maps all Chinese IPs to the same location, because it could be hard to retrieve more precise info. The locations in such tables are often quite crude, based on data that's aggregated from various sources and IP lookups. If you have an IP you know to which country it belongs because you can simple check which provider registered it in which country (for example at bgp.he.net, but this is publicly available info). If the provider happens to be active in one province/state only you can narrow it down further. For a more precise lookup you can trace an IP, which will give you more info about the area. For example, when I trace your IP in Canada I may get a path like Home -&gt; regional hub -&gt; regional hub -&gt; Amsterdam -&gt; Ashburn/NYC -&gt; Toronto -&gt; regional hub -&gt; ... -&gt; your home. If from elsewhere I know the last regional hub is in Montr√©al, then I'm quite sure you're living in the proximity of Montr√©al and that's the closest we can get. Such information is worth *gold*, as it can be used for targeted advertising without even knowing who the person is you're targeting. It's very plausible that for China no such info is collected by the GeoIP database. Maybe it's hard to pinpoint IPs to locations because the IP space is changing a lot every day, or maybe China is just not interesting to target for the databases.
It totally depends. You can target the nth child of a parent with a class or id or you can scan the innerTEXT of the element, or you can just parse all children of a parent. CSSselect and XPATH can be your friends.

I would check out inventwithpython.com. They have some nice free content in terms of books and tutorials for projects. Maybe pick a project from their game or cryptography books.

In your defense, it's not consistent and it is confusing. Strings and integers don't behave this way in Python, but dicts and lists do. Other than reading the docs closely or experiencing it as a bug in your own code, there's no reason that you'd expect this inconsistency of behavior. Getting confused by it and crawling deep into variable passing semantics/deep-copying to understand why this happens is a common "coming of age" moment for Pythonistas. There exist other languages that don't have this inconsistency, Clojure for example commits to immutability fully and you'll never encounter a case where you implicitly modify data in a way that is visible from the parent scope. There are performance reasons why Python has this behavior, but it's explicitly trading away consistent behavior in core data-types for performance. So when people say "It's not a bug in Python", they're not wrong... but it's an idiosyncratic design choice that confuses many novices and that many other languages handle differently by having separate mutable and immutable types.
I wonder if that big red spot in Kansas is [this place](https://splinternews.com/this-is-the-new-digital-center-of-the-united-states-1793856143)
you should crosspost this to /r/MapPorn!
I use PyCharm so it‚Äôs not really an issue. I write a section, clean it up, and move on. 
Does pycharm tell you where you could write a better code? I guess you are referring to styling mostly
Styling mostly. Sometimes it lets you know when types are incompatible and things too. 
Being a German guy in South America, I can ensure that many Brazilian folks love Reddit (mainly in my coworker social circle). I'm glad that knowledge is international!
I'm in the same boat (somewhat). You're probably looking for an answer from someone with more experience, but when time permits I refer to PEP guides for Pyhton; they allow me to follow accepted standards for writing code. Here is a link I've used in the past: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
Styling is less a concern than the quality of the code. I am reading code written by others and sometimes I feel like I am reading alien written code. I struggle to understand it

So THATS how you use a variable, I've been wondering this for AGES! Can you have more than one?
This seems more suited for r/learnpython
While there is definitely some good value in this topic, i would offer a few (hopefully) constructive criticisms. I didn't come to the article understanding the connection between dictionaries and hash tables so the structure of your introduction feels confusing. Two seemingly random paragraphs followed by an "objective" paragraph that does not adequately explain the connection. This leads to me feeling confused through the entire article until i pieced it together after the fact, what you were attempting. Then, I'm well acquainted with Python dicts, but not so much with hash tables so it might be good to do a very short but of theory about what they're used for in CS generally. From there i have the info i need to enjoy the topic of building one from scratch.
Almost (but not quite) enough for me to get it to do what I want.
yea from that selling point of getting out of your way and you just writing python really is appealing to me. However, like you've said, django is a very polished all in one product. Thats pretty hard to pass up as a beginner especially how i am trying to do a full stack app. Thanks for the advice on Django rest framework. Looks great
everything in memory is stored as a reference, when working with primitive data types the pointers change every time you reassign a new variable. for objects though the pointer remains the same which is why you can make an object and make another variable that points to the same object and if you change the values inside the object the original object changes as well
Pythonic code is like punctuation in English. Sure, you can write a whole book without punctuation, paragraphs and capital letters but it would be ugly and hard to read. If you practise for long enough, it becomes second nature so you capitalise the first word of every sentence and full stop on the end of every sentence.
Got it. And stupid new reddit can‚Äôt see sidebar. 
Probably where whatever he used for the geoIP data defaults to if it doesn't know the precise location in a country (i.e. the centre of Greenland). You can see a similar thing in China where there's a large amount of traffic from the centre when there's no major population there.
Honestly one of the best browsers that I‚Äôve used. Since the Vi-bindings are built-in, it flows a lot more nicely than Firefox/Chrome + Vimium
It's only legal to buy, not use, Reddit in China.
Same. Documentation + google.
Thank you! I've been trying to understand the different behaviors between the typing members and their original counterparts. So this one seems to largely overlap the use case for a frozen dataclass; any insight as to when/why to use a frozen dataclass instead? 
BOOO
Hello! I'm a bot! It looks to me like your post might be better suited for r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. That said, I am a bot and it is hard to tell. Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster. Show /r/learnpython the code you have tried and describe where you are stuck. You can also ask this question in the [Python discord](https://discord.gg/3Abzge7), a large, friendly community focused around the Python programming language, open to those who wish to learn the language or improve their skills, as well as those looking to help others. *** [^(README)](https://github.com/CrakeNotSnowman/redditPythonHelper) ^(|) [^(FAQ)](https://github.com/CrakeNotSnowman/redditPythonHelper/blob/master/FAQ.md) ^(|) ^(this bot is written and managed by /u/IAmKindOfCreative) ^(This bot is currently under development and experiencing changes to improve its usefulness)
These concerns don't often clash, but when they do I favor readability over optimality. This reverses if the code in question becomes a noticeable bottleneck for application performance.
Yes, but that's not how Python works -- it doesn't have primitive data types at all! In a language like Java, doing `int y = x` copies the primitive value of x, but compare that with Python's behavior: &gt;&gt;&gt; x = 384830 &gt;&gt;&gt; y = x &gt;&gt;&gt; z = 384830 &gt;&gt;&gt; x is y True &gt;&gt;&gt; x is z False &gt;&gt;&gt; id(x) 139799918891792 &gt;&gt;&gt; id(y) 139799918891792 &gt;&gt;&gt; id(z) 139799918893360
I know this is a wrong way to think but I‚Äôm almost intimidated how big this community is. Makes me feel like I‚Äôm almost too late to hop on. I know I should think this way but I‚Äôm a little older now and big learning curves are kinda intimidating 
Cool
The difference is, sometimes hard to read code can be read by the machine and perform much faster. You have to make a decision to either make it easier on the machine to perform or if you want someone else to be able to read the code should the need arise. Something only I should be working on, like a personal project, I will focus on making it perform the best; something that will be worked on as a team, I try to make things a little easier to read without impacting performance that can lead to cost increase to run a process. If I cannot make something as readable as I would like, comments are an option to help explain. 
Most of the gems act like kickstarters. Bigger the community, better the feedback gets. Your work will of course get appreciated if it suits the subreddit's needs. 
Okay cool. Thank you :) 
Love this project. Keep up the great work!

After I've read your comment I thought common, it can't be that big. But damn dude what the hell

In the month values example, you have use country_names instead of month_values as the array. Otherwise very good explanation of how to add or substitute values.
I'm working on writing an alarm clock code that will dim up a couple of LEDs and play audio files that the user has uploaded onto a pi zero. Also hoping to eventually have it double as a weather station, as well as a bluetooth audio player. I'm pretty new to Python (and programming in general), so it's probably going to take me much longer than it should!
