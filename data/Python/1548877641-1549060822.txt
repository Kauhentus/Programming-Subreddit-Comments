that's really cool
&gt; But this isn't true. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A tuple is immutable, but if it contains a mutable object such as a list, set, or dict, it is not hashable. Yury says this in his twitter thread: &gt;That said, it's possible for an immutable collection to be non-hashable. Hashing is a recursive operation, so If an immutable collection contains a mutable object, it becomes non-hashable. https://twitter.com/1st1/status/1090325247830704128 So I think its pretty clear that when talking about "immutable hashable objects" he means objects which are immutable all the way through and through.
We have a Makefile (standard entry point for all our projects) that runs the following line when bootstraping the project git config core.hooksPath .githooks This sets up the local git repo to run our custom githooks, which we can then ship with repo/project So our `.githooks/pre-push` file in the repo contains #!/usr/bin/env bash set -e make lint make test Which forces the linter and test suit to run before git will push a commit, it's cut down on failed builds dramatically. Would love to hear some arguments for why adding in another tool with a yaml config &amp; abstraction layer is better than using bash/shell scripts which can also be shipped with the repo

Firstly, I didn't take a calc class. Well I did, but it wasn't required for my major (A.S. Software Development). I did get the degree, but only a little 2 year. I did go to a community College (MCTC in MN), which does have an excellent CS/IT program. A 2 year A.S. degree should be enough xp for you to at the very least land a low(15$+) p/t internship or something. One of my classmates was a 45 year old woman who used to work for one of our local TV stations as a producer, went to school for the 2 year degree, now is a programmer doing just fine and enjoying her work more. So there are all sorts of us out there is what I'm getting at. Seriously I am *so* bad at math. This is why I became a programmer in part (I can google to get answers to math scenarios.) . Also if you end up in the Ecommerce section of the world of programming you will be doing a lot of Front-End/Back-end work and not necessarily have to use complex mathematics.
WingIDE is worth a shot. For a long time it was about neck-and-neck with PyCharm.
That's really reassuring. Thanks again for your input.
Thanks :) 
I would also suggest WingIDE. I've used it for years (since the 2.0 days) and really enjoy using it. I've yet to find anything that comes close to its debugger.

&gt; So I think its pretty clear that when talking about "immutable hashable objects" he means objects which are immutable all the way through and through. The order of his words and points causes confusion and can lead to horrendous mistakes. To someone who knows Python, sure, it is understandable. But to a beginner, it is horrific.
Kind of, I like my code the very special way.
Are you not allowed to install your own software on your laptop?
&gt; s the best, it's what I currently use, but they are taking it away in about what do ya mean taking it away? No more EDU or Community editions ?
&gt; why Because you're not a racist, who can't tell the difference between yellow people.
I'd just buy it on my own because it makes my own life easier and more efficient.
The question was about debugging. What's a good vim setup that helps with this? &amp;#x200B; (Serious question, I like vim via ssh, but have no idea if there's a usable way to debug with it) &amp;#x200B;
Talk with management. It's a stupid policy. If they're trying to save $$$, they'll end up losing way more in lost productivity.

I've tried so hard to start using vim. Spent a few full days reading tutorials, fiddling with configuration, learning vimscript, installing language servers. Spent a further few days forcing myself to use it instead of pycharm. Vim is a spectacular text editor. It's incredibly powerful. But it's not an IDE, its ecosystem is a fucking mess, and its features (such as they are) are far from discoverable.
Off topic: What is the color scheme on those `&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;` parts? Asking for a pycharm.
Oh definitely, but it sounds like in OPs case they have some push to standardize the IDE across devs (which also seems like an annoying level of micromanagement).
&gt; This is kind of pedantic Why do people say this in a technical discussion. If you can't be accurate in a technical discussion, when can you be accurate?
The color theme is [https://draculatheme.com/prism/](https://draculatheme.com/prism/), but there are instructions for pycharm \[here\]([https://draculatheme.com/jetbrains/](https://draculatheme.com/jetbrains/)). The font for the site including the code snippet is \[Dank Mono\]([https://dank.sh/](https://dank.sh/))
I said this: &gt; if you have an immutable object, then you can create an immutable hash value for it And you said it isn't true but I don't see where you argue against it. You say: &gt; A tuple is immutable, but if it contains a mutable object such as a list, set, or dict, it is not hashable Which is equivalent to "if you have a mutable type, it is not hashable" And then you say: &gt; The reverse is also true-- any class deriving from object is hashable (unless __hash__ is overwritten in the MRO), but unless written such that all attributes can't be set nor deleted after object initialization, it is mutable. Which translates as "any class is hashable, but mutable classes will have 'mutable' (e.g. non-constant) hash values" 
Because even in a technical conversation it's annoying and unproductive to halt the discussion (or criticize the speaker) over overly-literal interpretations or criticism over minor, insignificant details. Saying the criticism is pedantic acknowledges that it is accurate, but besides the point. It would like if someone asks how to do a matrix multiple in python and I say "use numpy and the np.dot function" and someone else chimes in "nah ah! technically that's not python because numpy uses fortran! You're wrong and bad and you should never give advice". See what I mean?
Why don’t you just use 2to3 It reformats the code and it pretty much stays the same

That's great, thanks. I'll look into it. I'd rather re-program my habits and just learn it though. Good suggestion!

Can you elaborate? 
yeh u know me
- knocked out a one-off script to pull three values from ~125 different Excel files scattered in a ~125 different directories; required a little extra logic because the values would always be in an expected column but not always the expected row - worked on the core of an audit tool that, for each client, looks at 185 fields in a SQL table and determines what percentage of that client's records have that field populated; core functionality works, just waiting to find out what the export should be (for now it just prints, and I can pipe to a csv.) - put together a prototype for management of a tool for one of our QA processes; instead of the performer going to a web interface and verifying dozens of data points across several pages, this pulls all the data directly from Mongo and puts them in one place in the correct order (i.e. it makes the QA process much more efficient.) - finished up a pytest course; worked through some BeatifulSoup tutorials

With vscode you can debug flask easily https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-flask#_run-the-app-in-the-debugger
It's python. Just do ``` pip install Bluetooth. bt =bluetooth.Bluetooth(). ``` ( I guess... Kappa) 
Right, if you replaced flask with pyramid, it would totally be an article written based on my experience. The thing is, it just doesn't matter. Just build something.

Yes it works if That ‘a’ string is there but doesn’t if it is removed. At least with the examples posted it doesn’t. I will have to give formatted strings alook. 
OMEGALUL IT'S ACTUALLY TRUE. Example 3-1. findmyphone.py ``` import bluetooth target_name = "My Phone" target_address = None nearby_devices = bluetooth.discover_devices() for bdaddr in nearby_devices: if target_name == bluetooth.lookup_name( bdaddr ): target_address = bdaddr break if target_address is not None: print ("found target bluetooth device with address ", target_address) else: print "could not find target bluetooth device nearby" ``` 
Vim has no built in debugging support. I don't dev in Python regularly but Vim is my daily driver. I would try ipydb if I really needed a debugger. (My dayjob is Ruby on Rails, and I use byebug when I really need a debugger. Byebug is also a text-mode debugger tool like ipydb) The best answer is "don't use a debugger, it's a crutch". With proper decoupling and unit tests you'll need your debugger so rarely that it won't matter. I realize this isn't a reasonable answer for an existing code base.
Just getting started with some tutorials! I had begun an associate's in computer science but never finished, so I'm having a blast getting back into it so far!

&gt; that doesn't look particularly better than pythons syntax especially for nested callables I guess that's a matter of opinion, but in my experience Go's syntax is more popular, even among my Python-dev colleagues who have never written Go before. The other tricky thing about Python's syntax is (last I checked) it had no way to express args/kwargs or default values in the type. &gt; For your second, if both methods use the same generic types, the object should inherent from Generic. If the methods are just generic but not relatedly generic, then use individual typevars. They can all be the same, since typevars are evaluated per function or generic object only. This is helpful. My question was about the second scenario. Where does one define the typevar? In the class or in the module scope? Sounds like it may not matter, but module scope is more conventional? And while I'm genuinely confused and grateful for the clarification, this was originally meant to be indicative of the broader confusion that arises from Python's conservative approach to typing syntax support. They could go a long way by extending the syntax more either by extending the syntax supported by the interpreter or by pushing the syntax extensions into a new language that "transpiles" to Python a la TypeScript.
The general answer is "Vim is an editor. Unix is an IDE." Of course that's technically BS because it's not an "integrated" environment if you have separate tools. All the same, I think you'll find that anyone who uses Vim daily relies on a host of other tools to help them do their job, and fill gaps in their workflow. Example: I have configured my vim so that the keystrokes "\\json" pipes my current document through \`python3 -m jsontool\` to reformat it as pretty JSON. Vim isn't formatting the document, the python stdlib is. This isn't an example of Vim 'missing a feature' as much as it's an example of how Vim follows the Unix philosphy.
This is why I am such a fan of Go
I completely agree, editorconfig changes everything. Playing Devil's advocate, one reason for the team to standardize on tooling is that you can share optimizations and experience within the team. My company is very strict about developers getting to use whatever editor/platform they want, but it does lead to some hassle. All the same, the team would never standardize on my favorite (Vim) so I cope.
The lack of symbols to identify blocks of code. Indenting as a way to mark a blocks of code is a real pain in the ass. It is incredibly easy to have some nasty bugs show up because some spaces appeared in the code instead of tabs. Beyond that strange behavior when trying to create text streams. I actually like Python and try to avoid expecting to much from a scripting language as far as performance goes. This seems to be where most of the detractors tend to complain about Python. I try to tell them that Python isn’t there for execution performance but I actually don’t believe many understand that. It is the same thing with complaints about executables, if you want an executable Python is the wrong choice. 
&gt; The other tricky thing about Python's syntax is (last I checked) it had no way to express args/kwargs or default values in the type. You're not wrong, and I do dislike this, especially given that this past week I've written a decorator that conditionally changes output types, so being able to do some stronger work with `Callable[[Callable[..., original_return], Callable[..., new_return]]`, would have been nice. &gt; This is helpful. My question was about the second scenario. Where does one define the typevar? In the class or in the module scope? Sounds like it may not matter, but module scope is more conventional? Module scope is more common. Something like T = TypeVar('T') def f(t: T) -&gt; T: return t def g(t: T) -&gt; T: return t There's no requirement that `T` be the same across `f` and `g`. The above is equivalent to defining `T` and `S`, and using one in each function. &gt;They could go a long way by extending the syntax more either by extending the syntax supported by the interpreter or by pushing the syntax extensions into a new language that "transpiles" to Python a la TypeScript. FWIW, I'm not sure how necessary this is. Because types are just python syntax and can be manipulated as such, you can do a lot of *really* powerful stuff. For example I've been getting a lot of mileage out of various forms of if six.PY2: X = TypeVar('X', bound=one_thing) else: X = TypeVar('X', bound=a_different_thing) which can be useful if the api/type changed between the python2 and python3 versions of a module and you want your code to be compatible with both. Similarly, you can define objects and functions that return Types, which can be useful. All of that gets analyzed at "compile" time. Some smart work could probably get you some form of dependent types, for example. You'd likely need to do the gross thing you have to do in java to get dependent types too, which is define `ONE` and `TWO` as generics and implement, but the codegen could be done in a module you'd import and then you'd be done and it would mostly just work, I think.
No I am not. Everything has to be downloaded through our company's software store.
&gt; blackbox \[...\] efficiently searches for a global optimum (minimum) of an expensive black-box function Interesting. How does this compare to [hyperopt](https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt)? &amp;#x200B;
They are blocking all Jetbrain applications from being downloaded on our machines
Nope, they are taking all of Jetbrains away unfortunately
Nope. Can't use EDU/community/pro, nothing :/
What is the reason for this? It really doesn't make sense to me. Have you told them how much slower development will be without it?
Yeah, everyone using different tools also makes mobbing hard.
Bizarre, considering it's written in Python.
It probably helps that pre-commit works on Windows as well as Linux/Mac. It can also target changes files only, which can be important with some tools / project sizes. Your approach is nice — as our company don't need to support development on Windows, I think I will test this for my projects. I found pre-commit to be a bit of a hassle. I also would like a simple way of running docker build and run, and pytest locally. 
That sounds incredible -- all the flexibility of VS Code, but as an IDE. Can it really be done though?
Disclaimer: it's a (fantastic) debugger frontend, not an IDE.
Automate the boring stuff is what you need.
r/learnpython
Well then, more power to you, but it seems pointless to me.
read the sidebar.
I don't know R but after a quick look in the package I think you can do it with pandas, maybe some handy method of Finstr should be implemented on your own, but pandas is definitely something to check. 
Use the string.isupper() method supplied buy python, this will return a True or False. Using this in a IF statement to check if the user input is uppercase, ELSE ask the user to re-enter using uppercase only. Hope that helps.
Sit there with the user. Speak your instructions clearly, and be unsparing with the yardstick when they do it wrong.

Real devs use vim!
I like WingIDE
Did a quick search, and this Slashdot comment (and its children) from a year or so ago captures the essence: https://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=10854741&amp;cid=54793683
While your comment has been properly addressed below by /r/Deto (thank you!), I'd also like to point out that a few Twitter posts should not be viewed as official and exhaustive Python documentation ;) If you do want to actually help and think that you're competent enough, I suggest you to create PRs to improve Python docs instead. There are multiple places where they can be better structured.
Why not? :)
Taking a very large SQL file and trying to make charts/graphs with it to pull data my boss is asking about at work on an underpowered crap computer. 
Step detection, like , someone taking a step? I had something on a raspberry pi zero w and an 3 axis breakout, and did some tests walking, jumping, ect, and found the G's for steps, and set it for that g level (ignore the axis orientation stuff). Simple solution to a simple problem, imo. Or are you talking about something else?
&gt; &gt; A tuple is immutable, but if it contains a mutable object such as a list, set, or dict, it is not hashable &gt; Which is equivalent to "if you have a mutable type, it is not hashable" This is not true. What are you smoking? a = [] b = (a,) A is mutable. B is immutable. B is not "deeply immutable" (such that all data within the immutable type is also immutable). Just because B is immutable doesn't mean you can get a hash for it, because the built in hash function fails due to the fact that it isn't deeply immutable. And before you start arguing that "immutable" and the concept of "deeply immutable" I am stating are in fact the same, no they are not. According to the python docs immutablity doesn't even mention the immutablity of data members. If you decide to argue "wait, the docs also say 'they [immutable objects] play an important role in places where a constant hash value is needed, for example as a key in a dictionary'", important role does not mean universal rule. Furthermore, &gt; &gt; if you have an immutable object, then you can create an immutable hash value for it &gt; And you said it isn't true but I don't see where you argue against it. I supplied the counter example of a custom-created object. The simplest code counter example would be class foo(object): __hash__ = None __slots__ = tuple() A `foo` object would be immutable. This example is an object without data however if I wasn't on mobile I would be happy to write a class just like this but has a data-encapsulating initializer. Either way, this object is not hashable. Further-furthermore, &gt; &gt; The reverse is also true-- any class deriving from object is hashable (unless __hash__ is overwritten in the MRO), but unless written such that all attributes can't be set nor deleted after object initialization, it is mutable. &gt; Which translates as "any class is hashable, but mutable classes will have 'mutable' (e.g. non-constant) hash values" No it doesn't. Take, for example, the following: class bar(object): pass I can add and modify and mutate and (well, almost any) attribute of data I wish on such an object. It is *mutable*. However, I will always have a consistent hash value, because the builtin hash function for basic objects (at least in CPython), is linked to the object's id (which is constant and unique throughout at least the object's lifetime). Further-furthermore addendum: &gt; "...is hashable, but mutable classes will have 'mutable' (e.g. non-constant) hash values" This is a contradiction. For an object to be considered hashable, by definition in the documentation, the hash value must be consistent across the object's lifetime. In short, There are three concepts. Mutablity. Hashability. Having a hash value. Mutability is unrelated to the other two. Hashability implies having a hash value. *Most* builtins that are immutable are hashable in practice, due to in practice most immutable objects being deeply immutable, and those objects providing a hash function that returns a value based on their elements. This is not a hard and fast rule, however.
And forgot a `;` or `} ` is not annoying as well? Even more if you are working with a compilated language (Java?). Also it's not a real issue when you know that most editor know the day tell it to you. 
Capital True, False, and None, which is just slightly more cumbersome to type. And I'd far prefer null over None just to match other languages. There's a lot to be said for being better, but not for being just different. (I know some design came from some earlier languages, but null and nil cover the vast majority of modern languages.)
Nice, I work for a large company in a call center area, and I pull custin SQL, writing pandas/matplotlib stuff to organize and plot the data, it turns out great, I had great reactions to it. But I'm still making my crap call center wage and get ignored when I ask about moving up. Frustrated with it, but I enjoy the programming aspect, even if I'm doing it free during my time off.
&gt; over overly-literal interpretations or criticism over minor, insignificant details This isn't an overly literal interpretation. And in code, only literal interpretation matters. And this is extreme significanct, especially to beginners. &gt; It would like if someone asks how to do a matrix multiple in python and I say "use numpy and the np.dot function" and someone else chimes in "nah ah! technically that's not python because numpy uses fortran! You're wrong and bad and you should never give advice". See what I mean? You're comparing apples and oranges man. Your example is a Python wrapper and a Python function being called non-Python due to the underlying implementation being different. I'm showing that the implementation, documentation-supplied definition that has real world consequences and the definition given by this guy do not match up. And if in your example your question specified "using at most the standard library as of Py3.7", then in fact the guy who chimes in would be more than justified.

&gt; I'd also like to point out that a few Twitter posts should not be viewed as official and exhaustive Python documentation Absolutely. But I'd argue that as the tweeter is a self-proclaimed PSF fellow and core developer, he has the responsibility to at least clarify that his notions work most of the time and that there are important subtleties that one can read more about in the docs. Even that is better than it currently stands. Everyone knows that there will be at least one beginner who reads this and takes it as gospel because it came from a self proclaimed PSF fellow and core dev.
If it works as advertised This is gonna be such an insane time saver
In upper case of course. 
...because it is incredibly hard to read and follow to the point that third party apps exist solely for the reason to try and make both of the above better?
Are you trolling? Like seriously, you're switching around definitions of what it means to be hashable so that you can argue against whatever I'm saying. Earlier you said this: &gt; A tuple is immutable, but if it contains a mutable object such as a list, set, or dict, it is not hashable. Now you're saying this: &gt; Just because B is immutable doesn't mean you can get a hash for it, because the built in hash function fails due to the fact that it isn't deeply immutable Of course you *can* compute a hash value for literally anything that is stored in memory. Again, besides the point. I'm not going to waste any more time discussing this with you.
Would there be a way to host this on a website if someone wanted to, where people could just go to the website and not have to have python installed?
&gt; important subtleties that one can read more about in the docs I stand by by what I wrote there. It's not possible to write something that exhaustively describes every possible detail, and frankly, I wasn't aiming to do that at all. &gt; self-proclaimed PSF fellow and core developer What? I'm not self-proclaimed. My list of Python contributions grows day by day. I'm also not cowardly hiding behind an anonymous name on reddit. Sorry, I have no interest to continue this conversation with you.
It is fairly easy to convert the row tuple to a row dictionary. You need the column names from the cursor description. rowdict = dict(zip([d[0] for d in cursor.description], rowtuple) This assumes the sql column names are also python identifiers. If not, you will need to write a name translation function to wrap the `d[0]
Actually it works really well with vehicles and objects due to their easy-to-handle edges compared to bodies etc Give it a try and see by yourself! :) 
It's in Python. I don't see any reason to not support unix systems.
Since it's in Python, can we also get a linux/OSX version too? (:
Then don't read it and don't follow. Who are you to dictate what people should or shouldn't use? ;)
&gt; I stand by by what I wrote there. It's not possible to write something that exhaustively describes every possible detail, and frankly, I wasn't aiming to do that at all. And that's fine. But even simply adding "look at the docs for subtleties" is better, of which you're ignoring that part of my reply. &gt; What? I'm not self-proclaimed. My list of Python contributions grows day by day. Bull-fucking-shit. It is [***in your damned Twitter bio***](https://i.imgur.com/VhkrkXq.jpg). &gt; I'm also not cowardly hiding behind an anonymous name on reddit. Really?

You're being called out on your bullshit and losing. Retreating is shameful.
Simply saying there are better mediums out there man.
&gt; Bull-fucking-shit. It is in your damned Twitter bio. I think you don't quite understand what "self-proclaimed" means :)
&gt; Are you trolling? Nope. &gt; Like seriously, you're switching around definitions of what it means to be hashable so that you can argue against whatever I'm saying. Nope, I'm not. The two quotes you pulled are not mutually exclusive. &gt; Of course you *can* compute a hash value for literally anything that is stored in memory. Again, besides the point. I'm not going to waste any more time discussing this with you. You're taking my "the world is a shade of gray" statements I'm saying and cutting them up and splicing them around to fit your black-and-white narrative.
[Do you?](https://www.google.com/search?q=define+self+proclaimed) &gt; self-pro·claimed &gt; Dictionary result for self-proclaimed &gt; /ˈˌself prəˈklāmd/ &gt; adjective &gt; described as or proclaimed to be such by oneself, without endorsement by others. You *described to be* such [*a PSF fellow and core developer*] by yourself [via your Twitter bio], *without endorsement by others.* You're fighting a dictionary man.
I just finished up a simple data analysis of Iowa liquor sales! I have some experience in Python, but I'm new to Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and all that. Like I said, the project is pretty simple, but I had a lot of fun working on it. https://github.com/connortoliver/iowa-liquor-sales
What was wrong with python2?
Training a discord A.I. using all of Reddit’s public comments as data.
"without endorsement by others" is the key. Saying that someone is a self-proclaimed, say, MD, means that they haven't received proper medical education. You saying that I'm a self-proclaimed core developer, suggests that I'm not actually one, which is simply not true. It is an offensive, inaccurate, rude, and most of all completely uncalled for message.
I’m a senior IT professional and I can tell you those comments are absolutely rubbish, firstly, no one is “super good” at developing/programming. Everyone codes differently, and the ones that end being really good are highly creative with their code, and everyone has strengths and weaknesses, (so be yourself). You need to be competent in other areas in the work place as well, it’s not just technical skill set (team fit, business acumen, etc). Secondly, from the top of head jobs that involve Python: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Configuration Management (CM) Continuous Integration Multi cloud platform scripting Middleware Serverless Architecture Containerisation Mobile app development Software engineering (Python is strong in areas such as facial recognition and web application for its use with Django) With machine learning, you can use NumPy, which I think is highly logical and once you played around with it, you can begin using it to number crunch. Allot of the skilled jobs above attract high salaries.
If you have good enough skills you can get an Up Work account and then do jobs for people using python. [https://www.upwork.com/](https://www.upwork.com/)
If you're even suggesting that people can donate to you, you should at least give credit for the stuff you've copy-pasted. For example: https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN
Upvote this post, thank you
&gt; You saying that I'm a self-proclaimed core developer, suggests that I'm not actually one, which is simply not true. [Endorsement](https://www.google.com/search?q=define+endorsement) of X and reality of X are not the same. You can be a computer scientist without having the endorsement that is at least a bachelor's degree, and then you'd be self proclaimed. But I have not anywhere seen someone othet than you or a group *endorse* the fact that you're a Python core developer. You are most definitely a core developer, and if you thought I meant that you weren't, this isn't the case. On top of being a core developer, you are endorsed as a maintainer/expert of 8 different concepts in the Expert's index. Self-proclaimed or not, hell take the phrase out of every one of my comments. The point stands firm. You as a core developer and PSF fellow have a responsibility to not mislead people and at the bare minimum could have added "check the official docs for the subtleties". 
I'm not a fan of Django's kitchen sink mentality but if you're playing to Django's strengths then it's hard to beat. It just sucks if you need to step outside those strengths (eg I had a project where mongo was a good fit, surprisingly, and I immediately discarded Django as an option simply because mongo support gets hacked into the model system).
Why would you need to use wine to execute a python program? Almost all python code works on all platforms.
I didn't copy paste it, this is the source code for the model and I just used a pre trained version (I did give the link to download the model on the README). I couldn't train the model myself since I don't have that much computational power, It would take me weeks :) 
How would css be applied to this? 
Hey man excellent work. Heres some tips to consider for future python projects: print 'Taco Bell, Sushi, or Pizza Hut. Which do you choose?' while True: next = raw_input('&gt; ') if 'taco' in next or 'bell' in next or 'tb' in next: tacobell() elif 'sushi' in next or 'asian' in next or 'fish' in next: sushi() elif 'pizza' in next or 'hut' in next: pizzahut() else: print 'Pick one.' For blocks of code like this, you can use fuzzywuzzy to match for you. Also you can `.lower()` the input before comparing: from fuzzywuzzy import fuzz next = str(raw_input("&gt; ")).lower() if fuzz(next, "taco bell") &gt; 25: You can delegate the work of picking an option to a single function (like `option_parser`), then 
/r/learnpython
Or you could use a sane editor which has a shortcut or command for commenting/uncommenting blocks. Also, I have no idea what you're actually suggesting because you haven't formatted your code correctly.
There’s no sidebar on mobile. Most people don’t see it.
That's very easy to fix: just change your color scheme to white text on a black background.
+10000 for standalone executable. Is there any good way to do this? Anyone got links that would help? pipsi was a semi-haccky way to do it with symlinked virtualenvs. That project is somewhat dead though I think.
Turns out all you have to do it google the name of your Reddit app + “sidebar”. Not actually rocket surgery; just lazy. 
You can also click the subreddit link and do About. Doesn’t change that no one sees it.
I highly recommend MIT's OCW, I think the course I've looked at is called intro to programming using python or something like that. Also crash course for python is a book I've been working through that walks you through developing a 2d game. So far it's not terribly challenging 
Oh rip sorry I'm new to posting on reddit I don't know how the code formatting works, probably should've looked it up
You need to understand (not just for python, for me this is any language): * All of the standard portions of the language, syntactically speaking. Well enough that it should be rare to need to google regularly used syntax, but rarely used (in general, not by you) syntax can be "I know what it is and what it's used for but I might need to see an example". * Idiomatic patterns typically used in the language * Have a decent knowledge of where to find standard data structures in the standard library, how/when to use them, and common patterns with them * Understand at least one (and be familiar enough with them to be capable of understanding others if need be.) * dependency management system/tool * unit testing tool * integration for CI/CD * configuration management tool * integration for IaC * web application framework (if it applies to the job) * gui framework (if it applies to the job) None of this implies super good. It simply says you know how to utilize the language professionally. Once you start understanding more than 1 language in this way, each new one comes very easily. In fact - I have always focused on how to quickly find resources to become familiar with these aspects/uses of a language more than I have studied languages outside of work. It keeps me able to pick just about anything up and run with it in a few short weeks.
Hey man excellent work. Heres some tips to consider for future python projects: I would delegate getting user input into a single function call: def user_input(): data = raw_input("&gt; ") return data.lower() For blocks of code like the below, you can use loops to make the comparisons for you, or even better fuzzywuzzy, as /u/Acsutt0n suggested). Also you can `.lower()` the input before comparing: print 'Taco Bell, Sushi, or Pizza Hut. Which do you choose?' while True: next = raw_input('&gt; ') if 'taco' in next or 'bell' in next or 'tb' in next: tacobell() elif 'sushi' in next or 'asian' in next or 'fish' in next: sushi() elif 'pizza' in next or 'hut' in next: pizzahut() else: print 'Pick one.' fuzzywuzzy and user_input example: from fuzzywuzzy import fuzz next = user_input() if fuzz(next, "taco bell") &gt; 25: tacobell() Also you have giant portions of code that are just repeating lines of print -&gt; raw_input -&gt; print -&gt; raw_input: print 'You start flipping through the discount rack when you feel a strange sensation in your body.' raw_input('&gt; ') print 'You stomach does a flip as you feel the Taco Bell you ate earlier making a comeback. raw_input('&gt; ') print 'Your insides spin, agrily protesting the coagulated mass of cheap ingredients that are laying waste to your digestive tract. You need to find a bathroom. Now.' raw_input('&gt; ') I would recommend a `story_output()` function, something like this: def story_output(data): _ = os.system("clear") if _: _ = os.system("cls") for char in data: sys.stdout.write(char) if char == "\n": time.sleep(1.2) elif char == ".": time.sleep(0.8) else: time.sleep(0.02) raw_input("\n...") Check out how that function makes that block look: https://i.imgur.com/grTjAR4.gifv Finally, why did you make this a .exe? It is trivial to get the python code out of it. I don't know why you did this, but from looking at the code theres no reason this couldn't have run on linux as a .py file. Your only import is: `from sys import exit` I'll respect your decision and not dump the source, but in case you were thinking freezing your python code "protects" it, it does not. 
Fixed it now
To what are you referring when you use the word "This"?
So it seems I'm going the right way by trying to track each and every transaction so I can have an idea of how much I spend and from there set a reasonable limit. I'll have to work on getting the habit, though. &gt; I prefer a simple app with no clutter, just press a button to add an expense, choose the category and that's it. &gt; After a couple of months i created an excel spreadsheet and imported my daily transactions See, importing data is the step I want to get rid of by getting some kind of online service going for me. I'd rather send some message that then will be parsed by a server instead of saving to a file inside my phone to then come back home and *import* it. That's why I had the idea of getting it to work with some messaging app (XMPP or Telegram, I don't know yet) so the moment I spend I can easily register the transaction. &gt; One very important tip is to save some small percentage for "FUCK YOU" money, which you can spend without giving yourself excuses, just like a cheat day in diet, this will help you stay on course. \*pulls out an envelop and writes "FUCK YOU money" on it\* Thank you very much for your feedback. It has helped me realize I wasn't so far off with my plans. Now I just need to get off my ass and start achieving them.
Why does it say "Do not use this"?

&gt; A is mutable. &gt; &gt; B is immutable. Pedantry time! So, B (the tuple `([], )`) is mutable, in that it's value can change. For example: &gt;&gt;&gt; a = (1, 2, [30, 40]) &gt;&gt;&gt; b = (1, 2, [30, 40]) &gt;&gt;&gt; a == b True &gt;&gt;&gt; a[2][0] = 'changed' &gt;&gt;&gt; a == b False The tuples `a` and `b` used to have the same value, then they no longer had the same value. One of their values must have changed (and I'd say it's `a`, since we didn't touch `b`). Therefore, tuples can be mutable. Which leads us to a rather philosophical "what do we mean by value in Python?" which is a much longer comment that I'd like to go into (the short version is "value is determined by the type's __eq__() method.)
I'm having the same problem. I checked around and saw that a solution for some people was to make sure that there were no mkl dll files in their system32 folders..apparently removing or disabling them by renaming the files has worked for some people. Apparently there's an issue where if anaconda finds those .dlls in the system32 folder it will use them over the versions installed in Anaconda\\library\\bin. This hasn't worked for me though, I'm still getting the same error.
Nice app. Thanks for the link!
So basically, your end story is a function of the food you ate?
It’s called Bandersnatch— oh god, who is doing this?
I guess that Internet Exploer 6 also still exists _technically_ as does windows XP, and netscape navigator.
Though that is a good workaround solution, it shouldn't need it, and so the op should look to find a way to make it cross platform compatible.
Damn, my second-favorite OS too!
Ehh, the problem with Django is that the docs and community are based around large monolithic apps. However, you can use Django almost just like Flask. You can use mongo and just use Django's views and templating without much effort at all. The problem a lot of people run in to is that they google for something like "replace Django's ORM with X", whereas you really just want to forget Django's ORM exists and use whatever ORM you like in your views. Django doesn't even have to know about it. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with Flask...it's great. Just that if you know Django well, you can do basically the same thing with it.

Check out /r/learnpython - Learn Python the Hard Way is not a recommendable source. You could try Python Crash Course or Automate the Boring Stuff with Python.
&gt; Pedantry time! So, B (the tuple `([], )`) is mutable, in that its value can change. For example:... &gt; The tuples `a` and `b` used to have the same value, then they no longer had the same value. One of their values must have changed (and I'd say it's `a`, since we didn't touch `b`). Therefore, tuples can be mutable. &gt; Which leads us to a rather philosophical "what do we mean by value in Python?" which is a much longer comment that I'd like to go into (the short version is "value is determined by the type's _ _ eq _ _ () method.") Extra pedantry time: is it the value that matters? Both I and the official documentation would argue that `b` has not changed. `b`'s third element is the object-reference to the given list. The object reference never changes, the object it refers to changes. If you come from a C background you can make an an easy analogy via multi-dimensional pointers. int a = 5; int b = 6; int *ap = &amp;a; int *bp = &amp;b; int *foo[2] = {a, b}; foo[0][0] = 7; // has foo changed? No, the referent of foo[0] has. This is the same reason the implicit copy, move constructors and the implicit equality operator has so much nuance and design choice making when writing C++. Are we the same because we have the same value? Or because we have the same address? If you did &gt;&gt;&gt; a[2] is b[2] False At any point you'd see the trouble. Same goes with a and b themselves-- you're constructing them via literals each time, and values more complex than booleans and smaller ints aren't cached. If you replaced the list with a custom object with no explicit defined `__eq__` method, the equality would be False at `a == b` because the default equality check is object identity. Or you could mark an equality method as always returning True, and then by your argument the tuple would be immutable In short, as I've said time and time again here, these objects you listed *are* immutable by the documentation's remark. But they aren't "deeply immutable" (which, yes, is a phrase I'm pulling out of my ass to refer to objects that are immutable, containing only immutable elements, all the way down the object-reference tree). In practice, immutable objects are usually either deeply immutable or contain elements in which their hash is consistent despite mutability (such as a custom object using the default hash method which relies on the id). Hence these two subarchetypes of immutablity are also hashable because the built-in hash function provides a hash value that won't change. But for the love of god, Hashability, immutablity, and having a hash value, are (fortunately or not) unrelated. Is it a pedantic remark? Sure. Is it important? If the original tweet wasn't clearly posed torward beginners who don't know these nuances, no. I don't care for this argument. I care about people in positions of power giving misleading information to others who are just learning. Because you learn it incorrect the first time, it will be stuck like that in your head forever.
Never do this before. But I'm sure there is one
Automatic texts that are sent out regularly to friends and family. Python starts the conversation... when they respond, you respond. Then it’s easy to stay caught up with everyone.
How would I go about setting that up?? 
It was a joke
well i mean it would be possible, no? as long as you had some sort of app and bluetooth connecting your phone texts to your laptop? idk 
It wasn’t a joke.
sharing is caring &amp;#x200B;
The paper it was written for is here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.00998.pdf The difference (as I understand it) is that hyperopt is setting parameters and evaluates the model directly. Blackbox assumes that the model is too computationally expensive to evaluate directly in an online manner. Instead blackbox attempts to create a response surface to estimate model performance (which as you can imagine is updated by actual model results when available). So ideally you get a computationally inexpensive approximation of model response. 
Python is a huge portion of my workflow. So for me to be able to present a solution that allows me to continue to use and alleviates their concerns would be the ultimate outcome. 
I used to have the same frustration, until I used autoformatting to convert all tabs to 4 spaces.
Could you add an option to cut the background out or make it transparent, rather than gray-scale?
Their concern is more around could any of python’s modules present a safety risk (ie. allowing outside parties to access internal environment. I was going to also suggest virtualenv as a solution as well. 
Hahaha! Thanks. I appreciate the input, and the chuckle. =]
Cool. I will check that out. Thanks. 
Boilerplate code in root packages, to prepare the python path, namespacing and importing. &amp;#x200B; I think having something which searches site packages, and automatically sets up the python path for each package and imported sub packages / modules, would be an improvement.
I wrote an entire course on this: [https://testdriven.io/courses/microservices-with-docker-flask-and-react/](https://testdriven.io/courses/microservices-with-docker-flask-and-react/).
Feature suggestion: for each wallpaper downloaded, clean the metadata (or configurable file that makes users decide what metadata to delete automatically). Good project btw.
For which countries? Or is this a global average? &amp;#x200B; For example, my understanding of the australasian market is Javascript, React, Java and C++ are top for learning.

here is the part where I declare the colormap: NDWIcmap = cm.get_cmap('ocean') NDWIcmap.set_bad((0,0,0,0)) then I have NDWI, a 2d numpy array containing nan and values between 0 and 1 NDWIrgb=NDWIcmap(NDWI) ##this line causes MemoryError Do you want a copy of the full code? 
I have a python, use it with your wife, or girl friend
Yeah, like if you have a tri axial accelerometer strapped onto you and the algorithm has to figure out when you took a step based on the incoming data (extracted features). It's a machine learning based approach as opposed to what you described (from what I can tell). If your objective was the same as mine, what accuracy did you achieve with your method? I actually started learning ML/data science around 3 months ago so I'm still finding my way with this stuff.
Thanks! :)

You should be able spin up a Kubernetes cluster on both Circle and Travis with either [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/) or [Kubernetes IN Docker](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind) (kind).

I was thinking I could run it and see if I could reproduce your error. Does the object have a .dtype attribute that you can modify?
unfortunately, the [ListedColormap](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.colors.ListedColormap.html#matplotlib.colors.ListedColormap) object doesn't have a dtype attribute. I'll post the full code in a second
My advice is to hold off with the carrier change for now. You have obligations to your family that have to be fulfilled and frankly I think there is a better way than to just set "carrier change " as the goal. I'd suggest a different approach instead. You're good at your job? Looking for some practical problems to get back into the programming? Combine the two: find something at your work that can benefit from a little Python. Programming is a lot about solving a problem and being good at your area means you're half way there. Pick a task that you're throughly familiar with (i.e. you already know the real-life solution) and translate this solution into Python. Pick another task to automate, then another.. This way you'll be holding to your $$ making occupation while learning what you are passionate about. After a while you'll become proficient in programming to the point when you can consider actual carrier change without jeopardizing your family. My bet however is that by that time you'll be recognized as a niche expert at your own company and I wouldn't be surprised if doors start opening, opportunities you don't even realize exist. Good luck 
post a link to the code.
Ok, I posted the code in the main post. :)
Nothing was wrong with it, what is wrong with it is that it's Long deprecated. It's like still using windows xp - it works but why would you do it. The syntax is different, structure is different (unbound methods and "new style classes" come to mind) it doesn't have new optimized features like f-strings, it drags the development of Python 3 down because the devs constantly have to maintain and test old stuff too and it's just fucking annoying that there's always that one dense motherfucker on Stack overflow saying "mimimi that won't work with Python 2" - "yeah of course it won't, it's 2019 ya wanker"
So the program requires a folder full of specifically named same-sized black and white images to process, and I'm not sure how to share that. BTW, I realized the issue was that I was running this with 32 bit python, but I have a 64 bit os, so I was only allowed to access 4GB of ram
This is an awesome project, I might give this a shot.
You can even customize the CSV files to make a whole new game of your own. The engine takes the CSV files (level stats, enemy stats and names, etc) and turns them into an SQLite3 database. It was a great exercise in learning to program, and I got a couple of my friends hooked trying to get to level 15 and win. 
It probably inherits the dtype of the colors array passed in. What is the type of that array? Is it a numpy array by chance?
it does. the colors array is built-in, and the dtype is float64
&gt; Mobile app development ... Finance Mobile app development? Isn't that restricted to Java for Android and Objective C for iOS? Am I missing something?
when creating a numpy array, you can specify the dtype as a keyword. something like: colors = np.zeros([5,10,1], dtype='float16')
A few reasons: * it only optimizes direct tail calls, it doesn't do anything for mutually-recursive calls (a -&gt; b -&gt; a -&gt; ...), * I don't intend to maintain the package, * and, while it's cool that you can modify the language like this, it's not exactly idiomatic or something you should force upon your coworkers. 
This week I'm developing a tool for r/GuildWars2 and using Pyside2 and just python to code it is great. I feel like I'll never have to learn C++ (thanks god) because of this. Source code: https://github.com/Aens/Gw2RaidExplorer There is probably bugs and poor code because I'm self-taught on everything (git, python, programming, english speaking) so let me know if you see anything that could be improved! What are your thoughs?
I second for SQLAlchemy Core. ORM is an overkill for most projects and is also slow. Before using SQLALchemy I built a large library around pure pyodbc (ODBC driver that I later used with SQLAlchemy). It is much nicer than simply returning a tuple. See [https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/wiki/Row](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/wiki/Row): `cursor.execute("select album_id, photo_id from photos where user_id=1")` `row = cursor.fetchone()` `print(row.album_id, row.photo_id)` `print(row[0], row[1]) # same as above, but less readable` However, SQLAlchemy Core provides many advantages over pure SQL -- it saves you from heavy string manipulation with limited safety checking. SQLAlchemy Core is mostly compatible and interoperable with ORM, and will provide an easy learning curve for you. &amp;#x200B;
Appreciate the input man (woman?). That's a lot of good info! I'll look at using those techniques in future projects. To answer your question: \&gt; Finally, why did you make this a .exe? I wanted more than python programmers to be able to play it. I may look at releasing the source later so linux/ mac users can use it also. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
I'm not gonna look at your code, and go try my own. Great idea
2d adventure. The point is to live one day as one of 3 characters whose decisions affect other two lifes. I'm still deciding how the gameplay will go so now it's more working on desdoc. But it will be python and pygame. 
Looking at already complete game engines like gamemaker studio and godot can give you more insight how the development goes. Especially godot docs. I'm a math and cs graduate and if math was explained like that when I was a little kid my university time would be much easier. 
We are Netflix...

Not as much as restructuring my code every time I run across one of the "gotchas." Couldn't you have just moved on if you didn't care about this?
Dont do it. 
You could not be more wrong, it’s specifically permitted by the license. Personal licenses are cheaper because they’re *personal*, as in, they’re associated with an individual and can not be shared. That doesn’t mean you can’t use it at your day job (you very much can) it means you can’t lend it to a colleague and when and where you go it goes with you.

I think the hard part here would be to find the balance between recipients enjoying the activity, and feeling spammed. Even if you have a whole list of different "opening" templates that you send, eventually it might become repetitive and the recipient may find it a bit impersonal. (How many spam comments/emails with "Hello, {{ name }}. How are you today?" have you responded favorably to yourself? So if I already don't believe in this concept, why am I about to tell you ways to do it? Weeeell, because even if this particular project might crash and burn, you'd still have learnt something from it, and who knows when, in some other context or setting, you might have a need to be able to send messages (it might be your business-critical server spamming you with alerts the next time around ;)) So, there are a couple of different approaches. I personally really dislike being dependent on third parties, since they have a tendency to go out of business at the most inappropriate of times, but that said, there is twilio.com, which could be used to send messages. There is also the wammu project (wammu.eu) which may be of interest. And there is always also the option to programmatically send emails, or post to twitter, or... you get the picture.
Wow this is truly amazing advice. Thank you so much for your 2 cents. This is such a good way to approach this.
Why are you using `is` with sets? Do you understand how sets work? https://tio.run/##K6gsycjPM/7/v0LBVqHaUEfBSEfBuFaBq6AoM69Ew1AhM0@hQhPBK0bwKkA8QxQeXL@mwv//AA
The thing I am currently toying with myself (you mention grocery list, this is related) is using owntracks (smartphone app), to communicate with mosquitto (message queue) on my server at home. I then also have mqttwarn set up to listen in on specific topics from mosquitto, and execute (python) scripts which evaluate the message, and finally potentially act on the message. So say I have a grocery list, say I have told owntracks that there is a region around my nearest grocery store, such that owntracks will detect when I come near that store. owntracks would send an event e.g. "padowi enters groceryStoreRegion" mqttwarn listens in on the topic that owntracks sends to, calls a script, which in turn checks what the message was. "Ok", says the script, so I entered that region. The time is in the afternoon. The calendar is pretty empty. eMail/Text/whatever the shopping list to my phone. I haven't gotten off my ass and done all of this myself yet, so I have no code to contribute, but this is what I am working towards myself.
This is not strange, afaik this behaviour is normal and the reason is you should use '==' if u want to check if the object is the same instead of 'is'. 'is' operator checks for the same instance of the object. Here link to SO with more details: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/132988/is-there-a-difference-between-and-is#133024
To me, this: &gt; I really like having Python objects returned like with SQA basically sounds like: &gt; I like to drink instant juice. I'm just too addicted to the artificial flavor and the colors are so bright and pretty. How can I make my orange juice taste like it's, basically corn syrup with a bunch of preservatives? I mean, maybe you can, but I find it hard to see how that would do you any good.
But what if we actually want the NSFW stuff? 
don't bother with this guy, he will literally argue with anyone over anything. I can't believe he's making this thread into an argument about what 'self-proclaimed' means lol.
&gt; A hashable object doesn't have to be immutable. This is pedantic, but according to the Python glossary: &gt; An object is hashable if it has a hash value which never changes during its lifetime (it needs a __hash__() method) This means that if you have a mutable object and implement its hash based on its (changing) value, then the hash changes as the value changes. You can still write code that does this anyway, but it breaks this rule. You might wonder about this mutable, hashable class: class Point: def __init__(self, x, y): self.x = x self.y = y def __hash__(self): return id(self) You can change the x and y attributes, so it's mutable right? Well, technically no. The "value" of the object is dictated by the _ _ eq _ _ () method, which by default compares identity: &gt;&gt;&gt; a = Point(10, 10) &gt;&gt;&gt; b = Point(10, 10) &gt;&gt;&gt; a == b False So what if you add an _ _ eq _ _ () method, then? class Point: def __init__(self, x, y): self.x = x self.y = y def __hash__(self): return id(self) def __eg__(self, other): if not isinstance(other, MutablePoint): return False return self.x == other.x and self.y == other.y Now this works, right? &gt;&gt;&gt; a = Point(10, 10) &gt;&gt;&gt; b = Point(10, 10) &gt;&gt;&gt; a == b True Still, no, because now it isn't **correcly** hashable, because the other rule is (also from the Python glossary): An object is hashable if [...], and can be compared to other objects (it needs an __eq__() method). Hashable objects which compare equal must have the same hash value. So either a mutable object can be hashable or have a properly working == operator, but not both. Effectively, this means only immutable objects can be hashable. But why are there these two rules in the first place? I'm not sure, but I think they made that decision because if mutable objects were hashable, the hash would have to be recalculated each time the value changed, leading to slow downs in performance that could be hard to debug. Imagine a 4 billion item list have to recalculate its hash each time a value in it changed. It's easier (and safer) to deal with hashes for only immutable objects.
There may be a better/easier way to do it, but I scripted something similar back in December, and figured out how to scroll to the next content by looking in Chrome's developer tools. In the Network tab, you can see the GET request that the browser sends to the server when you click the 'Next' link. The request that loads the next batch (page 2) from the initial page, looks like this: [`https://www.marvel.com/v1/pagination/grid_cards?offset=36&amp;limit=36&amp;entityType=character&amp;sortDirection=asc&amp;sortField=title`](https://www.marvel.com/v1/pagination/grid_cards?offset=36&amp;limit=36&amp;entityType=character&amp;sortDirection=asc&amp;sortField=title) &amp;#x200B; The query string parameters in the URL are: 1. **offset:** 36 2. **limit:** 36 3. **entityType:** character 4. **sortDirection:** asc 5. **sortField:** title To go to Page 3 from Page 2, the URL that gets sent is: [`https://www.marvel.com/v1/pagination/grid_cards?offset=72&amp;limit=36&amp;entityType=character&amp;sortDirection=asc&amp;sortField=title`](https://www.marvel.com/v1/pagination/grid_cards?offset=72&amp;limit=36&amp;entityType=character&amp;sortDirection=asc&amp;sortField=title) &amp;#x200B; and the query string parameters are: 1. **offset:** 72 2. **limit:** 36 3. **entityType:** character 4. **sortDirection:** asc 5. **sortField:** title My guess is, if you want to get the next 36 characters, you would change the offset parameter in the URL to 108, then scrape that page, then send the URL with the offset value 144, scrape it, then 180, 216, 252....
Working on it :)

iOS: Yes, typically you would use Swift or Obectiver-C. Id say Swift is as human readable as Python. However, you can indeed use Python, PyObjC or tinpy which allows C++ parsing. The iOS developer guidelines basically say you can use whatever you want. Android: There are many Python layers and IDE’s, I know a friend who uses Dr Python. However you would natively use Java or Kotlin. Don’t let that put you off. Once you create your first program in Python, you are well on your way to being a competent developer. If you are interested getting into the app development world, next stop I’d suggest learning Swift, which is not scary to learn. You would find yourself learning it quickly as you already would have the coding knowledge.

&gt;The lack of symbols to identify blocks of code. Indenting as a way to mark a blocks of code is a real pain in the ass. It is incredibly easy to have some nasty bugs show up because some spaces appeared in the code instead of tabs. Tabs vs. spaces is IMHO a total non-issue: 1. Set your editor to always use (4) spaces for tabs. 2. Use Python 3, since mixing tabs and spaces gives you a \`TabError\` The indentation-as-scope can be tricky if you nest very far, but that can usually be avoided by either extracting parts of your nest levels as functions, or in somce cases by using relevant parts in \`itertools\`.
Good question, haven't thought of it. Some sort of API to inject style tags and add extra static folders I figure , Any ideas or PRs are welcome.

Thanks for the reply, that's very helpful. I'll have a look at the paper to try and understand this better.
Hey, I was able to get Spyder working on an older version of Anaconda Navigator with no problems. I uninstalled the 2018 version and downloaded Anaconda3-5.2.0-Windows-x86\_64 from Continuum's repo [here](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/.winzip/). Hope this works for you.
&gt; I would like to generate an exe file and put it in windows service so that my code is not visible to the client. This requirement doesn't make much sense... Services are very visible to the "client" (I think, you mean it as a "customer", the person who is using your program). All your client needs to do is to look at the services and they will find your program there... That said... if you need an executable file you want to run as an MS Windows service, you are probably better off writing your program in something like Visual C++. That'll solve the deployment problem for you.
Hey! I made something similar with the Unsplashed API! :D Though it doesn't shuffle that many images because I'm using the beta API-thingy which limits me to 5 requests/hour :P.
If you really want to have single executable file, you could use tools like py2exe, pyinstaller or cx_freeze to freeze your script. This is, however, usually not a best idea, as the final exe file needs to include the whole python interpreter and the process of freezing itself is considered rather cumbersome and generally pain in the a**. Maybe scheduling a task with windows' tasks scheduler is an option? You can hide cmd window from your user if you do 'pythonw.exe your_script.py', if this is a case.
I use [ShareX](https://www.google.com/search?q=sharex) for screen captures and recordings; free, open source, and even available on Steam. Fantastic work; not sure how I wasn't aware of Pyside2!
I'm developing a TV Series / Movie scraper, [Owesc](https://git.kernel.live/btaskaya/owesc). Currently it has 2 provider, it uses youtube-dl as resolver with extra resolvers ([vev.io](https://vev.io), [thevideo.me](https://thevideo.me) and rapidvideo). I recently converted project to multiprocessing from async, it is better.
PyInstaller is what is currently most popular I believe. It's possible to make single-file binaries with it. I've used it for a mid-sized PySide2 project that uses sqlite for data storage and it works well for the most part. Sometimes it doesn't like some modules though, and you have to work around it. The size of the binary will become quite large as mentioned by others (around 55MiB for my application), but on the other hand the client machine won't have to install Python and the required dependencies you're using which themselves take up space (my project's venv folder is currently \~550MiB for example, mostly because of PySide and QT). So while the binary size is quite large it's still smaller in total than if the user had to install all the required modules and libraries.
Look at the file write module in Python. It could be useful. https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_file_write.asp

Learn to use google, it's one of the most basic python commands. Also: don't use random for anything related to passwords and security
Thank you
Why is ”random” bad?
Haha, :) Here is my latest one: [https://blog.finxter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/CheatSheet-Python-6-Coding-Interview-Questions-Email-Course-Ad.pdf](https://blog.finxter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/CheatSheet-Python-6-Coding-Interview-Questions-Email-Course-Ad.pdf)
Working on Python mitmproxy server to act as a middle man.. &gt;Please do suggest anything related to this..
Computers can not generate truely random anything. It can be close but there is an algorithm to generate random.
Because it's not "cryptographically secure". It uses the system time as seed for it's random number generator which means that if someone knows the time you generated it he knows the number. For everything security there's the `secrets` module. 
Cheers, and Sure, I'll do a little write up, video and share the code if its of interest. Also happy for feedback. Of course, at the moment it is just a lot of commented but unstructured structured code ;)
Ooooor, you just use `open`
Have her take a picture of it set up! I’m sure she’ll make a sign to go with it.
The python `random` module uses a *pseudo* random number generator, which means that an algorithm generates these random-looking numbers from a seed, but they are not really random. Knowing the seed or a couple of previously generated numbers would allow an attacker to guess future numbers generated from that seed. This is completely irrelevant if you are just generating a single password for personal use, but if you need large amounts of randomness for a security-critical applications, then using a pseudo-random source may weaken the security. An attacker with sufficient amounts of resources could, for example, try out all seeds that may have been used, until he finds the correct seed and can decrypt stuff you don't want to be decrypted. Guessing a seed is way more practical than guessing a large private key that was generated from a seed, because seeds are way smaller and less random. Most of the time, a seed is generated from some machine-specific constants and a timestamp, and there are only so many milliseconds in a day. The more an attacker knows about your system, the easier it is to guess the seed. So, to sum it up: Understand that secrets generated from a pseudo-random source are easier to guess than true randomness. It's still hard, and that is why pseudo-randomness is still useful. Just be aware of the difference. 
[PEP8: Spaces are the preferred indentation method.](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#tabs-or-spaces) 
```__dunders__``` are a bit ugly imo.
I am in the same boat. Did you find any solutions specifically for Visio?
+1 for obs
Type hinting is really good practice. Assuming you're roughly early twenties, learning type hinting is a good introduction to statically types languages, which will be good for future learning! Basically, it'll let you notice bugs (read line under the code) while in the code editor instead of when running the program. 
Ah, it parses the website because there's still no API. Hopefully that'll change as [they just announced that after several years the Alpha would end](https://alpha.wallhaven.cc/forums/thread/1778)
Almost! I turn 30 this year.
Very nice. Looking very elaborate. I loved working with PyQt/PySide too but when working on personal projects and packaging into exe for Windows 10... Windows give warnings way too scarier than it should be for unsigned files ... :( Web seems to be the most accessible without having to deal with that crap but I have no interest in learning JavaScript.
Yeah, that's inside the article.
Fbs is your best friend against that.
I am just starting out with Python. I like it a lot, but the double underscores are ugly and distracting. I plan to look into something like prettify-symbols-mode in Emacs, but for Vim. And I wouldn't mind if the indentation were replaced by {}.
Never heard anyone call it File write module. It's no module, it's part of the stock language
I just said "File write" because the article said so. I also pulled the "module" part right out of my ass because I didn't know what to call it :). Either way, the open() function is the way to go, with the additional arguments that the article mentions.
Sharex is amazing for snippets like these, don't need a full on screen recorder! &amp;#x200B;
Congratulations! Never played GW2 but this looks very informative and intuitive. Just curious, where/how did you start learning Python? I'm starting my self-taught programming journey now (also turn 30 this year) and currently i'm trying to gather as much learning material on it as I can. Automate the Boring Stuff gets a lot of respect on reddit so i'll probably start there.

KAREN TOOK THE ARC REACTOR
3-4 years ago I was in a webchat that had a bot and I was curious about it. There I learnt that bots were created getting something called "API" and I was like "what is that?". Upon research for a few days I noticed there was an easy way to access that API using python (turns out someone wrote a library for that specific chat) and I started playing with it for fun. Then eventually I was able to create my own bot and I learnt the basics of python adding commands. I programmed using notepad or IDLE so take this advice: Get into Pycharm ASAP, it will save you hundred of hours xD. Well, after that bot I realized I could do some other fun stuff if I could find other APIs. I made some silly projects like bots to update a wiki, bots for Teamspeak, basically bots everywhere. Then it turns out I coded an ERPs in Microsoft Access for my brother 1 year earlier and I was wondering if I would be able to do that with the freedom of Python so I got into databases (sqlite) and UIs and tried a bunch of them (tkinter, kivy, pyqt, etc) but it never clicked entirely until I found Pyside2. I got stuck several times (once for 1 entire month, damn generating PDFs, use pdfreport if you ever need to!) but eventually I was able to do a decent job and my brother stopped using MS Access in his business to start using my tool for billing and stuff. With that knowledge I started coding silly programs like a calendar/scheduler, a writer for novels, an VPS manager to launch bots over SSH, I even took a job for a transcriptor program with an audio player integrated. While doing that I learnt a bit of python everytime. Then one day I realized I learnt so much that I could improve my brother's program a lot, so I took upon the challenge to revamp the entire code and reduced 40.000 lines of code (no joke, the first version was hell of nightmare WET code. Google how to write DRY code). That's when I even dared to add different themes and my own classes. Now, 6-7 months later, I got all that experience and I can do programs like the one in this thread in less than 1 week. Things that helped me a lot: * Reading this subreddit daily (to be informed about python stuff, people post incredible useful things). * Stackoverflow when I'm stuck. * Find similar projects on Github to see what approach to make. * Pycharm warnings for code analysis (lets you know when and how a piece of code can be improved). * ORMs like Peewee are great for databases. My next journey is probably webs, but Django and Flask are hell of complicated to start with. I yet have to give it another try because each time I try I end up hating web programming lol. 
If you actually need a password generator, and not doing this as an exercise: use `pwgen`: https://linux.die.net/man/1/pwgen As for an exercise... what were the requirements? 
I just wanted to create something simple. I am not taking classes in python programming but i will soon
Try Think Python, it's short, free, and has lots of exercises. 
Thanks let me check that out!
you still should, c++ is awesome
I wish there was more info on using it with qml and bindings
The first idea that comme in mind is to use flask to create a small server that can be use to send and receive message. Maybe somone will have an other idea or library to share with you. 
The documentation for the sockets module shows how to do this
If you're looking to play with networking you could start with sockets. This is like as low-level networking as Python can easily do. Just as an example, pull up two python (3) shells and in the first setup the 'server': &gt;&gt;&gt; import socket &gt;&gt;&gt; s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) &gt;&gt;&gt; s.bind(('127.0.0.1', 65432)) &gt;&gt;&gt; s.listen() &gt;&gt;&gt; conn, _ = s.accept() This should hang on the last line, it is waiting for a message on port 65432. Then in the second python shell you can setup the 'client': &gt;&gt;&gt; import socket &gt;&gt;&gt; s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) &gt;&gt;&gt; s.connect(('127.0.0.1', 65432)) &gt;&gt;&gt; s.sendall(b'Hello world') Which connects to the same port and sends a message. The last command of the first shell should finish and if you type in the first shell (the server): &gt;&gt;&gt; conn.recv(1024) You should get 'Hello World' back. And this would work on two different machines across a network too, but '127.0.0.1' would have to be replaced with the ip of the server. --- So you could setup a two-way system where each side listens for a message coming in on their own IP and sends responses to the other's IP. But this can get complicated pretty quickly. For one thing the '1024' in the last line is the number of bytes to recieve, so if the message is more than 1024 bytes you don't get it all. There's an upper limit to what 1024 can be, so you end up looping until you get all the data, then concatenating it.
Done!
Why do you not want to learn C++
Python is fun, but you're gonna hate the dynamic typing once you dive in deeper.
You might want to learn how to take screenshots for later when you need to ask for help.
Well, "saving to file" is kind of broad. Files don't have a "save" functionality, they can be written to, they can be read from, truncated etc. I assume that you wanted to write to a file, but... do you care about the existing contents of the file? Do you want to write multiple passwords to the same file? Will you have to create a file, or it is OK to write to an existing file? Do you care if the file might be used by another program?
We were told to use google if we need help 🤔 
Compiling code scares the hell out of me because I often launch my programs 10 times in a minute to test and find bugs. The syntax is complicated with lot of symbols. Having to define different type of strings. I always hear it takes 7x time more to program than python. I yet have to find something I can’t do on python and can do on C++ that I actually need.
Got taught QBasic when in 3rd class. Then C, Vb, Binary, Asm, Java all in school officially.. It was one of a kind school. Almost everyone I know in my batch is specializing in computers now.. Really strange. No other batch before or after us learned all this. Teacher later said it was experimental courses for our batch. None the less, made it super easy for me to learn anything computer related, but made me suck at other subjects.
I wanted to write to a file the generated passwords. I got some help but now im wondering how i can make the password be one Enter apart and not written together everytime i run the script
Stackoverflow
You’ll be doing yourself a huge favor by really putting in the effort to learn python now while it’s part of a course. I studied physics, and learning python was one of the best decisions I made during undergrad. It was incredibly useful in other schoolwork and in my research, and has gotten me a great post-academia job.
Nice code thanks dude
Why would his age have any bearing on learning type hinting?
I have motion sickness from the shaky camera.

'Cause you can't teach us crotchety ol' dogs new tricks! :)
To be honest I have never coded in C++ so I don't have a clue but python does seem to be user friendly!
Now that python is used in embed devices and replacing many microprocessor codes (originally written in Assembly/C), its all more useful..
Vol
Yeah Its open source
C++ is much lower level, more to worry about. Pointers, strings, etc. There are ways to make it work in a more protected fashion (using string class, std template library, etc). But in general, python is much more friendly/safe. I learned on C++ way back, long before python was around. I wouldn't want to go back, it's much nicer to play in a higher-level library (especially for simple things like GUIs).
Qt for Python, a.k.a. PySide, is really good, and fixes the main downside of PyQt, i.e. the GPL requirement.
Next stop: try/except in python 😀
you can drop to cython to get that speed
And the next step is [select](https://docs.python.org/3/library/select.html). Then possibly something like [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/servers.html#putting-it-all-together)!

CSPRNGs are also pseudo random. They just are done in a way that is impossible to deduce their internal state from their outputs and are seeded by the system's pool of gathered entropy. /pedantry

I didn't mean much by it. I just started thinking along the lines of maybe he was studying something at university or similar. It was a dumb thing to say, so I've modified the above comment.
Mental plasticity is a well established phenomenon. It becomes more difficult to learn drastically new skills as you age. 
Yeah but... type hinting is cute but problematic. You aren’t actually constrained and it works against a feature of the language. 
Awesome; thanks!
It's really only good if you use an IDE that supports it. Also, only worth the time if you are working on a larger app or something that is intended to be around for a while. I use pycharm and implement type hints for everything I write at work but If I'm just writing a one-off script I don't usually bother.
wxPython, much simpler than PyQt and has a ton of extra widgets.

Well, inserting an empty line is the same operation as inserting your password, but as if it had zero characters (i.e. `''`). I.e. I imagine that you used a function to write a line, and this function would automatically append a newline character to the line you want to write. If the line is empty, then it will only write the newline character. The operation of writing to file multiple times while preserving all previous inputs and not creating "holes" is typically called "append".

Yeah they are cool, understanding side effects and why they are effective is valuable. The strong typed languages I mentioned also have protection against side effects. The coupling of the strong typing and overloading is very powerful. Interestingly both can overload on the return which is really interesting. The take away is that weak-dynamic types give you flexibility by allowing code to operate on disparate types. Strong static typed languages essentially invert the standard class function relationship. The function is associated with the type because of the declaration and the lack of ambiguity while oop languages will encapsulate the function within the type. 
Good work! This looks really nice. I have developed several moderately sized PySide2/PyQt apps but I am still using the default battleship grey themes. I am there with you on the job front. I really wish there were more PySide2/PyQt jobs out there, as I know it well and its a joy to work with, but jobs seem very limited.

There is almost **never** a good reason to do `from module import *`. It can have so many unintended consequences, greatly reduces the readability of your code, makes it very *implicit* as to what module you're using, and is just bad practice! 
How did you go about learning Python?
Yup, FP changes this relationship quite a lot. It gets interesting when your type system is powerful enough to be a proof engine :D
First stop taking pictures of your screen. You are basically forcing people to type out your code to help you and nobody wants to do that.
&gt; The python `random` module uses a *pseudo* random number generator Aren't all computer based random number generators pseudo random since our current technology is intrinsically deterministic?
Yes.
I use PyInstaller at work. I need to target RedHat Enterprise Linux 6 boxes with Python 3.5.

Anything? 
Python actually has a bunch of free resources. KhanAcademy is great for all things programming Youtube has full length video courses if you're a visual learner StackOverflow for questions Reddit to show off what you've designed
I can't remember the last time I've ever forgotten to add a `;` or `}`. An IDE not only takes care of braces but will also notify you on a missing semicolon.
I’ve now completed all the code so it can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, x^y and x^th root of y. Just trying to get it to do factorials now 😖

r/learnpython
Exactly. I'd much rather write a program in python and then profile to determine slow bits, and optimize those with cython.
Yes, business software. I write in javascript/python/SQL and a bunch of other things. I cut my teeth on BASIC (on an Intel 8088), then C, C++, etc.
Imo if your just straight up abandoning large parts of Django then it's the wrong fit for your app. I don't disagree that it's entirely possible to use Django the same way as Flask but I question doing that, the same as people building packages that are opinionated kitchen sinks for Flask.

Learning Kivy right now. The documentation is dog shit but the project itself is pretty interesting. Ended up choosing it over QT because of the licensing which made my head hurt.
If nobody wants to do that nobody should answer my question. It would've taken u less time and words to write the code, instead u decided to tell me this crap
This kind of menu structure isn't very good, as it ties the selection logic, the description and the output together. It would be better to create a generic logic that evaluates and prints a menu based upon a *data structure* that defines the menu entries and the resulting actions. This a a good way for a beginner to start improving his knowledge about how programming works at its core: find a generic enough solution to solve a specific problem. Textual menus are quite simple but essential for such a program as shown and a good example where you wanna establish a central solution, that gets *reused* all over the program. I have written a [tutorial](https://github.com/Lysander/snippets/blob/master/Python/python-misc/simplemenus/TUTORIAL.md) long time ago, which is only available in German - I have never found the motivation to translate it into English. But perhaps the code could guide all none German speakers too. (probably the Google translator is good enough today to make it understandable?)

Well, for one thing, we're talking in the context of the original article which claimed that you'd have to "rip out" (for example) the ORM from Django...as if *not* using the ORM was some extra work. I wouldn't exactly council someone to choose Django over Flask for doing (say) a microservice, because Flask is just great. However, I also wouldn't council someone to NOT use Django...if you understand how web frameworks work (admittedly a high bar). There is not extra work involved. No performance to be lost. I would disagree that building an "opinionated kitchen sink" for Flask is the flipside of using Django for a (say) microservice. The problem with using Flask is that the quality and consistency of all of the `flask-*` third-party packages varies widely. Gluing them all together is often a lot of work. Just not using the ORM in Django is no work at all. On top of that, we've all worked on projects where the specifications are a little hazy from the get-go and you just know the scope of the project is going to grow. I would guess that these types of projects are the vast majority. I would prefer to add bits of Django back-in then tack third party packages onto Flask. For anyone interested, here's a [complete Django project](https://github.com/readevalprint/mini-django/blob/master/pico_django.py): ```python from django.http import HttpResponse from django.conf.urls import url DEBUG = True ROOT_URLCONF = 'pico_django' ALLOWED_HOSTS = '*' DATABASES = {'default': {}} def index(request, name): return HttpResponse('Hello {name}!'.format(name=(name or 'World'))) urlpatterns = [ url(r'^(?P&lt;name&gt;\w+)?$', index) ] SECRET_KEY = "not so secret" ``` That's the extent of the work required to "rip out" the stuff in Django you don't want to use. 
I don't like your philosophy, old things are perfectly fine. The only reason not to use windows xp is because windows doesn't security patch it anymore. So what's wrong with using python 2 today? [American nukes are still controlled by a program using floppy disks](https://www.businessinsider.com/americas-nukes-floppy-disks-2016-5), Fortran77 code is still used today. There's not a single reason to change either of these. The only reason anything should be considered outdated is if there a security flaw found, which can be fixed without scraping compatibility.
Not if you feed them some real entropy now and then. There are many sources for entropy in a modern PC. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(computing) This is why wiggling your mouse can actually speed up cryptographic key generation. There is even specialized hardware that basically just generates noise at a high rate and produces high quality entropy. One example would be the noise generated by a CMOS sensor (e.g. a webcam) in complete darkness. 
**Entropy (computing)** In computing, entropy is the randomness collected by an operating system or application for use in cryptography or other uses that require random data. This randomness is often collected from hardware sources (variance in fan noise or HDD), either pre-existing ones such as mouse movements or specially provided randomness generators. A lack of entropy can have a negative impact on performance and security. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

If you look at the bottom of that Wiki page you'll see it's categorized under "Pseudorandom number generators". Do with that what you will. It's my understanding that the use of entropy doesn't inherently mean it's not pesudorandom. For example look at `/dev/urandom`([Wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//dev/random)). urandom uses "environmental noise" from drivers/keyboards/etc. and it's still considered to be pseudorandom.
If you say that you can't share your application with us because of sensible data, do that mean that many part of your app are hard coded, or data logic can work only with your specific use case?
They are - but there are advantages in a more modern system. You wouldn't write a new codebase in Fortran, would you ([I and many others would argue that you should even think hard about writing new C code today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSuRyLBrXgI))? And again if they want their systems to run in Python 2 so be it, leave them running, but if the support isn't there anymore it has a reason. Don't update these old system and keep the deprecated stuff in, update it. Indefinitely supporting old features, syntax, whatever ultimately is just sand in the gears of the language's progress. And still teaching this stuff is just argh. &amp;#x200B; IIRC Raymond Hettinger (python core dev) said in 2015 or so (at a pycon, it's on youtube, but I can't recall which talk it was) that he is immensly happy to see that more and more (/most) people changed to python 3 in production (he asked the question year after year).

You can try . format in print state E.g print( " Result = ".format(result) )

For short videos I've also used [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) pretty happily in the past - it's pretty much the Windows snipping tool but for GIFS. 
IMO you don't need type-hinting. At all. I doesn't do anything, it basically is a nothing more than a comment (well you could use a module to actually check types I guess) and the basic idea of them is against one basic principle of python. If you look at googles style guide it shows a imo great way to give semi-type hints: in the docstrings. If a function runs on an iterable put it to the description of that parameter - boom, done. &amp;#x200B; And I would support the "I don't need to learn C++" sentimentality. It of course can't hurt to learn more languages but there are better options out there. If you don't plan on learning it for professional reasons, where C++ probably will still prevail another 30 years, but rather for personal use: Learn rust. It's just as fast, if not faster than C/C++, you don't get cancer because of compilers etc. and it forces you to write safe code (study from some guy at MIT (IIRC - can provide a link to the talk where it comes up if anyone's interested) showed that most C/C++ applications have memory leaks etc. - even the guys that say "well I can write safe C" probably can't)

When I started to program, becaue I'm an idiot, instead of save the formulas inside csv files so I could modify if I need it, I declare variables and made lists of the formulas. That's why if I give you the code, all formulas, raw material, suppliers, amounts, etc. will be there.
No, just copy and paste the text
I use thonny, I've tried pycharm and didn't enjoy it. Looking at sublime text now.
Who gave you the idea that most boards support python? Do you consider the Pi a microcontroller? You'll have a REALLY hard time ever getting python onto an 8-bit micro (maybe something like the Atmega 2560, but I doubt it - and even if you could put it on, chances are the controller is quite a bit bigger than what's actually needed) and I think they're by far the most common out there.
Thanks for sharing your story and the tips, for someone that is starting it motivates me to keep learning new stuff. Since i'm just starting to learn my abc's I don't know how/where i could implement my code, reading some books might help give me some examples and build my path upon that. Right now I'm interested in making simple games, so that's my next step, a simple text based game or a visual novel using ren'py, but for now that stuff you mentioned is way over my head ahah. I'm using Atom, the packages is a neat feature, it allows you to customize it to your needs, like, color-coding, having a minimap to show an overall picture of your code or implement an unsupported language like ren'py for instance. It's pretty cool
Keep in mind that when you're writing a C++ program, you're generally going to have your code split across more than one file. When you make a change to a file, your compiler is pretty good about only re-compiling that file (and any files that depend on that file) - if you are making rapid changes to a single bit of your code, the compilation will be almost unnoticeable unless it's a really massive project. A lot of the concepts that give C++ its scary reputation (pointers, memory allocation, object lifetimes, typing, etc.) are all still *there* in Python, just hidden away. I definitely think that Python developers who want to improve should consider picking up some C++, if only to be able to approach these topics more confidently when they become important in the edge cases of Python programming. 
Isn't Micropython a thing? But yeah an interpreted language on microcontrollers doesn't sound optimal to me either
Most boards don't support python, I really don't know where he got that from. Just looking at it: circuitpython requires minimum 8k RAM for example. An Attiny85 has 512Bytes, the omnious Atmega328p has 2k. I can hate C as much as I want (and I really don't like it) it's still the way to go on micros.
I like python very much , you just have to deal with the language and the problem you are solving But when you try to deploy pyside python project it’s really pain that makes you wish you would be able to do this in compiling environment that’s where you consider C++ and for python programmer it’s really hard to grasp the language because the learning curve is different .. 
Yes, I'd say you aren't understanding the question. It's actually very simple. [See here.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/33463042)
I did when it was on the first version. I'll post it again when it's completed (still missing achievements, titles, etc).
This is such a great story. I feel like this would get you hired by 90% of the software hiring managers on the planet.
This is so much a matter of personal preference that I'd start with the list here [https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments](https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments). I've used IDLE and pydev but have now settled on Visual Studio Code, but note that I code purely for fun at home, not in a professional environment.
The fact they use expert. 
Dont ask python questions, ask programming questions and just have him write whiteboard code in python. Example, my company is ATT, I have this (prewritten) DB of telecom signaling info. I want you to provide me what you think the proper API setup would be. Id care more about his general problem solving/ability to think through things than anything else.
Heh... [h]ard. I see what you did there. 
How common are jobs that are heavily python oriented? I’m learning python right now and one day would love to be a software engineer, but I don’t know if I really have it in me to learn C++. 
It is, but it isn't really efficient. You'll need a way bigger controller than otherwise and a Basic size to even use it. There are loads of controllers with only a small fraction of micropythons minimal requirements
This isn't true, and the performance of C will continue to make it useful for embedded over Python.
There not hard problems anymore
Be careful with your example though... print( "Result = **{}**".format(result) )
I did an opposie
Ditto, the fact that they mention expert. I've seen people advertise as this in the past and it never holds up under scrutiny. There's two thing you can do here: 1. The slightly more pathological strategy is to ask questions about useful, but advanced (and therefore less-used) features of Python. Metaclasses, stateful decorators, stateful generators, implementing arithmetic over arbitrary object types using `__add__` &amp;c. By proxy, this does give insight into how familiar they are with more obscure software patterns in general: generators are a pattern, and decorators are a special syntax over factories. Adding state to either is an interesting way to build on questions about their familiarity with either pattern. Metaclasses are a type system pattern (but also arguably a factory) and likely to be less known outside of people who've been doing some really interesting Python code for a while. 2. Ask generalist programming questions and ask for solutions in Python. How would you implement a singleton in Python? How would you implement an efficient LRU cache? Can you explain the threading model behind Python's `threading` module? Compare and contrast vs `multiprocessing`, etc. This, without fail, weeds out a _lot_ of self-styled "experts." In either case, I also find it useful to ask about how familiar they are with the toolchain: common git commands (`revert` vs `reset`, `rebase+merge` vs just `merge`, whether they know what `reflog` does), Linux command trivia, network tooling or data processing tools if you're hiring for a position that uses that, etc.
I was in the same place about 6 years ago and now I am a python dev for a living! Best decision I have ever made
PyCharm. They have several licensing options and there’s a free community edition as well. 
OK, thanks. I really like C though I sorta suck at it. Now I just need to find a board and tutorial/book that will work on Lubuntu and/or Puppy.
These are awesome, many thanks!
Looks great. Do you have any tuts you would recommend? 
Pycharm is a charm
It's definitely possible. How long it takes you to learn enough to do it depends on how fast you'll be learning - it varies from person to person and really depends on how much time you spend on it. Automate The Boring Stuff is a great starting point.
I wasn't able to understand classes until I found this: https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/06/18/improve-your-python-python-classes-and-object-oriented-programming/ Before that I have read what classes are and do a bunch of times but I needed lot of examples to finally click.
&gt;How common are jobs that are heavily python oriented? Pretty common. I think I saw an article recently that said python was in the top 10 languages for jobs. Bear in mind, of course, that Software dev isn't the only job that will use python daily. Devops, academia, data science - all legit uses of python. Hell even admin jobs are spiced up with knowing a bit of Python. I found that my python skills overlapped about 80% with picking up VBA and that little language is basically available wherever you will need it, hidden tidily away inside Excel. &gt; I don’t know if I really have it in me to learn C++ There are plenty of languages that are as high level as Python. If you're looking for things that would be roughly comparable there are things like ruby. If you go into web you'll absolutely want some Javascript under your belt, and Javascript isn't much more of a push than python. As well as this, the more you learn about python, the less daunting other languages will seem. It took me a while, but I think I could probably hold my own in a Java role now.
Ask about packaging. How do they make their software available? How do they improve it? You want to avoid the whole 'works on my machine' as early as possible. IMO
I'm gonna make my input Ctrl-D
What advantages are there in a more modern system? I've never used Fortran, but if I did, I don't see why I wouldn't program with it. I mostly use Python since I'm more familiar with it, but if I'm writing something that requires efficiency, I'd use C. If we're citing people, Linus Torvalds thinks C++ sucks. I'm currently on a system which utilizes the Linux kernel, written mostly in C. What wrong with using Fortran77, or python2? Why does a language need active support? The only sort of things that needs active support are security libraries.
Yeah, python is great enough that it doesn't need to win every single battle.
OP, use "pass" for this situation instead. It's a no op keyword that the interpreter won't break on.
Definitely doable. So, your bottleneck seems to be spydus, which I imagine you can’t avoid using. Well, it’s just a web based service that is sending queries to a server. Good thing that such programs usually have an API. Which simply means that you can query the server with anything that speaks that same language. So your steps will be the following: 1) get the spydus API documentation 2) download postman and try to query spydus, look at the server response 3) write a python script that automatically incorporates your local database (excel files, you can easily export them in csv format to be more friendly to scripts) and queries spydus server. There are a few libraries that will handle that for you, also, postman will tell you exactly the code to use for each query you make. Then the script should take care of parsing the server response and do the logic checks you described. The output should be an updated list of customers without the inactive ones If you have an IT technician, offer him a beer and have a chat
I usually run Mint, but for microcontrollers I change to windows with atmel Studio (built on Visual Studio especially for micros). If you really don't want to Change you can always use avrdude via command line but I doubt that's fun. If you choose to go with avr controllers that is. As a programmer I use an atmel ICE (which supports on-chip Debugging which is really nice sometimes) and as programming board(which you really don't need, but it's more comfortable) I soldered one up myself. I think it actually is a good idea to start with assembly to get to know the basic principle of the system
[Link](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) Specifically, Chapter 12 (Excel) and Chapter 11 - Controlling the Browser with the selenium Module (three quarters of the way down the page). Refer to the early chapter for what the syntax means. Good luck.
&gt;Ive skimmed Automate the Boring Stuff in about 3 mins prior to me typing this that is the book i would recommend &gt;How long would it take for someone like me to learn to make a small program to save the day? I don't know how long the average beginner takes to learn, or how smart you are. However you have the right textbook and what you learn can be used again for other tasks.
As for material: I can't really give you advice on that. The YouTube Videos I've watched were bad, I read one book on it which was in German and the guy seemed like he was neither a good programmer, nor a good teacher.
&gt; So it's of no use to try to learn as we age? "It's harder, so f$#@! it." Who said that?
Cool story 
Fun fact: Perl has a `...` operator, called «yada yada». It replaces any statement, compiles, and dies with the message «Unimplemented» at runtime.
No they are not. Ellipsis is a valid python literal. [https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#Ellipsis](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#Ellipsis)
how is any of this expert-level? any senior-level engineer should be able to answer these. generally, i don't see why OP should be concentrating on determining the "expertness" of his Python knowledge. your goal with an interview is not to 'weeds out a lot of self-styled "experts"', but to determine whether the candidate will be a useful asset for the company, at a given price. an interview is not a dick measuring contest, but unfortunately many self-styled interviewers forget that bit. as long as he is able to clearly demonstrate excellent command of Python, there's no need to test for knowledge of the obscure details that can be easily learned when needed (but none of the examples here qualify as obscure though in my book). OP, you should instead focus on a) general problem-solving skills, one hypothetical task is enough here, b) determining if the candidate is a team player and will function well in your team with your company culture, c) breadth of his knowledge in other useful domains, such as networking, OS internals and databases (this is specific for a role to some extend, don't ask about things you don't need; alternatively ask about non-python topics that the candidate self-assesses as his strong points, and you happen to know a bit about too), d) see if he is able to lead the team and has positive leadership experience or aspirations, if he is keen on gently mentoring less senior team members etc, and finally e) try to somehow figure out if he meets the "gets things done" part of "smart and gets things done". this last one is the most important one, but it's also the hardest to test for. interviews generally suck, don't make them suck more by asking all the wrong things, making a fool of yourself and leaving a bad impression of your company. your time with the candidate is limited so make the best use out of it.
I hadn't come across enaml before. That looks really helpful. Thanks!
Idiot do not learns and doesn't understand their mistakes, so your are not an idiot. Let us know when you will have changing those part that do not let you share your code. 
yeah we all did 
You do that in only one week?! Great 
It's right in the name: it's more modern. There probably are more features, more safety, ongoing optimization, more active community, newly developed libraries etc. etc..I too am on a linux system and regularly write C - that it works doesn't mean it's good or optimal. C probably is just so widely used even today because everybody knows it and industries are very slow at adapting to new stuff. I think I've already linked the talk about drivers in various languages - they among other things talk about bugs, memory leaks etc. in the linux kernel that could've been prevented by using a more modern, more safe language WITHOUT any disadvantage like reduced speed. &amp;#x200B; A language like python needs active support because the interpreter needs to run on an everchanging OS. It's now like there's no development on Python 2 anymore, the last release was 2018-05-01 - and the time that's spent on that development could also go into making python 3.x better.
Micropython is a thing but it doesn't run on 8 bit chips. 32-bit chips are very common nowadays which is why Micropython exists. It'll slower, but dev time yadda yadda
You've been told by the bot before to asks these kinds of questions in /r/learnpython, as well as by other users and mods. 
I have the same problem. Did you succeed to solve it? 
num1 and num2 it can be anything, so you need a try except block for float conversion. you don't need that huge if statement. Much more elegant using dict (I think) arithmetic_dict = {'add': num1 + num2, 'subtract': num1 - num2, 'multiply': num1 * num2, 'divide': num1 / num2} arithmetic_dict[user_input] you don't need string conversion in results variable, because the print function can print anything. anyway :) good work, and have a nice and fun learning :)
C on microcontrollers is actually pretty fun because it's such a simple system to work with. No OS at all in many cases. C on desktop is a pain in the ass. All those pointers just to interact with the OS API.
Great that you're using Jupyter, but it's weird to see `input` still being taught to beginners. It's not a particularly useful function and makes even less sense in an environment like Jupyter which has interactive widgets.
Thanks a lot! It worked!

Technically it's not a syntax error, it's just stupid. Like even this isn't a syntax error: elif user_input == "subtract": "i can do anything" elif user_input == "multiply": ...
And yet my [pull request](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python/pull/1212) to have it added to [Awesome Python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python) goes ignored :(
Thanks everyone. I've settled on using Visual Studio Code for now, keep swimming in the MS pool, so to speak. Re PyCharm...I use JetBrains' DataGrip for postgres and mysql, but don't love it. It is almost too much, and I do not at all understand the point of the separate consoles which keep overwriting themselves. Lost too much work that way. I just want to open a file, work in it, run / debug it, and save it as I do in SSMS. I'm a one-man show at the office, so I need to keep it simple. I don't have a team that I share code and development.
Can you provide more information? is this a job offer? or school project, learning project?... Do you have any code? maybe on github?
Is this a job offer. Yes I have. No on github. I show more images of project if you have interest.
cool!
I was just experimenting with some code I found online and putting it together. The code in the picture is a few weeks ahead of where we are in lectures since we only just did print, integer, float, and string functions 😆 Don’t know why but I seem to be getting the hang of this coding malarkey pretty quickly 🤔 
The best way to design your UIs IMHO is with a GUI interface. Humans don't think in a "domain specific declarative language" when designing GUIs. It's the reason Delphi and Visual Basic were so popular in their day.
Ah I see! I hope they teach you Pandas, it's a great library that opens up a lot of possibilities (if you like working with data that is)
Being modern isn't an advantage and extra features are what libraries are for. As long as your security libraries are up-to-date, old languages are perfectly safe. C is always going to be more efficient than python, no matter how much they optimize it. The "more active community" isn't a given, pyglet is totally modern and it's community is no existent. Just because a library is new, doesn't mean it's better. That talk is pretty long, I'll watch it whenever I'm more motivated. Any memory leaks or bugs, could've been prevented by writing better code. What os is "everchanging"?
cooool Time to advance my job security :D
All hail rc.locale.
Yeah. We have 12 weeks to go from learning floats and strings to being able to use python to create graphs 🤔 
AMEN. I read posts here talking about how nice static typing and all the other C++ features must must be for larger projects, but like you I'm a refugee from lower-level languages and never want to play with pointers, manual memory management, etc. again if at all possible.
You did not develop a systemd service in python. You created a service file that calls a python script.
Do people actually use the StackOverflow search, though? I just search on Google and then inevitably select the StackOverflow link that appears.
I have a task I cannot complete: 1) You have a very large geodatabase table containing damage assessment survey data for the 2018 flood season. One of the columns is a text field holding the combined month-date in the format MMDD. For example, December 31 should be entered as 1231. However, the data entry was not consistent and some dates were entered as 3112. This is troublesome but at least you can fix the obvious cases where the numbers are wrong (in this example, the 31st month, 12th day is definitely in error). You are given a large python script that has almost been completed. This script relies on a cursor to go through each row and will do quality assurance on a series of columns. In the code, is a line that will send the date to a python module that will fix fields with obvious errors in compliance with the MMDD format. Your task is to write this module below. The module will receive the date field, fix the obvious date problems if required, and return it back to the main script.
My suggestion: Python has bindings for just about every language. You can use libraries from almost any language with more or less effort. But what about the other way? For that there's [Haxe](https://haxe.org/). Write once, transpile to C++, Java, Javascript, PHP, Flash, C#, lua, even Python! This lets you write code that can be called by almost every language. Between the two you're completely covered!
No, the ellipsis literal is fine. `pass` can be used when you explicitly want a no-op — eg empty function def or a 'catch and do nothing' — whereas this ellipsis indicates a section of code to be finished later. Even Guido was cool with this usage (having mentioned the fact that some people thought it'd be "cute" as a reason for implementing the literal)
I have to admit one of the great advantages of Pycharm is it's excellent extras, the tons of them (git history interface, grep, find usage of codepiece, ...). Heavy on the overhead (1.5 GB RAM), but best intellisense for Py i've used. Even when working on your own i do advice strongly to experiment with and use version control. VS is decent all around with plenty of packages for most other languages as well. 
Would he hire someone from Spain?
What do you use instead of input then? /newbie 
Im also starting with python but wouldn’t it be less work to declare num1 and num2 before making the if
Hmm ... I may have a look at amtel Studio if I can commandeer a Windows box. Otherwise, I might just give Arduino a try.
I’m also gonna be doing factorials and natural log and stuff, which will only require 1 number 🤔 
Arduino is fine to start with, with going to the microcontroller directly you gain Access to all the registers and thus "settings" and have the same functionality for ~2€ vs ~15€
Ask him language agnostic questions: As far as I'm gathering, you don't want someone to be good at python, but a good developer. He should have more knowledge than you would get from a code camp. Because you only have two developers working on the project, you want them to not only code but know what they are doing in a more general sense: If you don't have the database set up yet and that's something that he might need to do, ask him if he knows the [E/R-model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model) and give him some basic questions about it: i.e Let him build an exemplary business database in E/R-notation. Having someone that can properly design a database will solve a lot of problems before they arise. (especially if you want to grow the company) Even if he doesn't need to build the database, it doesn't hurt for someone to know how to design a database, especially if you work with one all the time. If this is nothing that he has to do and he doesn't know about this then ask him about simple algorithms and let him give you the computational complexity. (i.e. what's the fastest you can sort a list, what's the fastest you can do if you know the range of the values in that list) Let him read and write some UML models to figure out whether he can design software or is just a code monkey. Give him some system to design, like an exemplary online store and have him write down the class diagram. Then have him write an activity diagram: I got "backing pizza" (with the resources dough and tomatoes) as a question in my last interview. If you really want to test him, give him a sequence diagram. If he really is an expert he should be able to do this. If he can't write a UML diagram he isn't an expert. Being an expert includes having basic knowledge of designing and maintaining code, which is the reason why many people cringe at the idea of having a "python expert". There's no such thing as a python expert. If you really are an expert, you don't need the python, you could build a system in Java, Scala, Julia, C or python. Sure, it might take some getting used to it, but a real developer can code with any language. The abilities needed to be an "expert" are not tied to any language in particular. Another great tell is always mathematics: There are not programming experts that don't have a basic grasp on math: Give him the following task: Write the fastest program you can to add up the numbers from 0 to n. If he starts using loops, then ask him if he can do it faster. If he starts trying to do weird stuff, then this might be a bad sign. (although not a complete turnoff) He should be using the Gaussian sum: 0.5(n)(n+1) The great thing about this question is, that you can get the right answer, even if you don't know the formula beforehand. Another thing to ask would be to calculate the Fibonacci sequence recursively, then ask him to do this faster through [memoization}(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) Then ask him to do it iteratively. Also, try to really put on pressure. You want to know how frustration tolerant he is. But mainly try to keep stay away from python specific questions because you already know he has a good grasp on the language. No point in reconfirming that question or asking about rare language constructs that nobody uses/has to use/ know how to use. Try to pick out if he's a codecamp codemonkey or developer. 
**Entity–relationship model** An entity–relationship model (ER model for short) describes interrelated things of interest in a specific domain of knowledge. A basic ER model is composed of entity types (which classify the things of interest) and specifies relationships that can exist between entities (instances of those entity types). In software engineering, an ER model is commonly formed to represent things that a business needs to remember in order to perform business processes. Consequently, the ER model becomes an abstract data model, that defines a data or information structure which can be implemented in a database, typically a relational database. *** **Memoization** In computing, memoization or memoisation is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. Memoization has also been used in other contexts (and for purposes other than speed gains), such as in simple mutually recursive descent parsing. Although related to caching, memoization refers to a specific case of this optimization, distinguishing it from forms of caching such as buffering or page replacement. In the context of some logic programming languages, memoization is also known as tabling; see also lookup table. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
If I'm writing a command-line program that needs input arguments I'll use `sys.argv` or the `argparse` module. 
&gt;how is any of this expert-level? any senior-level engineer should be able to answer these. Should != could, many senior-level engineers are unfamiliar with that stuff. &gt;generally, i don't see why OP should be concentrating on determining the "expertness" of his Python knowledge. your goal with an interview is not to 'weeds out a lot of self-styled "experts"', but to determine whether the candidate will be a useful asset for the company, at a given price. Determining the "expertness" of a self-proclaimed "expert" is useful for assessing the ego/skill ratio of a candidate, which is arguably useful. I probably should've used something other than "weed out" in this case, though. &gt;general problem-solving skills, one hypothetical task is enough here This is _surprisingly_ difficult to get right in most roles, and very difficult to get accurate results from. Architecture questions (e.g. whiteboard, and talk me through, building an app that does X, and then go into detail about $these bits) are one of the best approaches but definitely not foolproof. I didn't bring this up in the spirit of addressing OP's question directly. &gt;determining if the candidate is a team player and will function well in your team with your company culture This _can_ be done using explicit soft-skills questions, but it's often just as good to assess this implicitly by challenging how they solve problems and assessing their responses both in terms of what they literally say to you, whether they keep a cool head, how they rethink their solution, etc.. Their demeanor throughout the interview also indicates this. &gt;breadth of his knowledge in other useful domains, such as networking, OS internals and databases (this is specific for a role to some extend, don't ask about things you don't need; alternatively ask about non-python topics that the candidate self-assesses as his strong points, and you happen to know a bit about too) See: architecture question. Great way to get an idea of what their strengths and weaknesses are and how they deal with their weak points. &gt;see if he is able to lead the team and has positive leadership experience or aspirations, if he is keen on gently mentoring less senior team members etc Totally not necessary for many individual contributor candidates IMO. It's one thing to have someone who can take initiative and use the tools at their disposition to their fullest extent to achieve a goal, but many senior engineers deliberately stay out of management and will give all the cues they can that they want to keep it this way. &gt;try to somehow figure out if he meets the "gets things done" part of "smart and gets things done". this last one is the most important one, but it's also the hardest to test for. This is solved using probationary periods. You can find out a surprisingly large amount about someone over 3-6 months. --- My comment wasn't about making the interview process a dick-measuring contest. Sometimes, you walk into an interview and the candidate's just got a very self-aggrandizing attitude. Resumes may hint at that, but while you should, always, _always_ enter an interview assuming good faith.
here is a good one [https://www.twitch.tv/anthonywritescode/videos](https://www.twitch.tv/anthonywritescode/videos)
Ah thanks. I'll check that out!
then you could nest ifs for example if (user_input == “factorial”) or (user_input == “log”) num1 = 5 #assinged by user If user_input==“factorial” #do factorial else #then ask for the 2 numbers because user isn’t doing a one number operation But yet again im new so i dont know if this is a good way to approach it
apologies if my comment sounded confrontational, all good stuff in this new reply of yours. 
ValueError
No worries, and thanks for being civil!
&gt; Do people actually use the StackOverflow search, though? Only when I post a question to StackOverflow and it asks me if my question matches another one it suggests.
Depends on what kind of information you'll need for your test env? Do you need the Request Headers as well? Can you legally do it? Does the data have PII? Otherwise, it's a feasible solution. There's services like https://fanout.io/ (not advocating) that can replay your requests to multiple endpoints. 
I literally just did user_input == ‘exponent’, user_input == ‘root’, and user_input == ‘factorial’ 😆:)
You want r/learnpython. And when posting there include a description of exactly what you tried and exactly what the error traceback contained.
Waaaaay to far away from me (((
Thanks for this. I too think I understand classes but every time I read a good article on this it makes a little more sense.
Mb. I was searching for hours looking for a simple solution with no avail so I went on this Reddit without looking more thoroughly for the correct one.
The script pretty much reads a midi file and translates the sounds into keyboard inputs to play the song on a virtual piano. I'm using it atm to help with learning certain piano skills. The script comes into two parts. One is called pyMIDI which takes the songs I put in the folder with the file and allows you to choose a song you'd like to play. The second script is called playSong and I believe it is in this script where the task is being accomplished. If I sent you the two scripts would that help you in aiding me with how I could do this?
You’ll find plenty of Pythons on there.
You need the exact same libraries installed as the system generating the file. If you open the pickle file you sometimes can make out a few libs. This is the annoying part about pickle. You might look into switching to protobuf or thrift
Why a whiteboard? I can't write fucking anything on a whiteboard
is there anyway to extract data by anymeans?
Is bs4 installed by default? check the packages that are being installed through conda
Just ask about certain design patterns and algorithms. Or ask to explain memory allocation, GIL,... Questions enough to test if someone is an expert 
Not sure the downvotes here.
Windows: windows key + shift + s Mac: command + shift + 3/4
Yeah, if I were to asked to just write code on a whiteboard I might just walk out. Talk about pressure. No, if someone wanted me to write domain-sepcific code in an interview I'd ask for a computer with an internet connection and the understanding that no one simply writes code off the top of their head.
That’s what one of the CS majors here told me. Once you learn one language learning others is much easier. I would really love to get into app development, although I may find a niche in web development. Never do know. I’ll definitely give JS a check out once I am a bit more fluent in python. 
Python has `Raise NotImplementedError`
And if not python, there are loads of jobs for languages much higher level than c++.
I've started using it for more specific questions, often seems to find better answers than google.
it's in: /anaconda3/anaconda3/conda-meta called: beautifulsoup4-4.7.1-py36_1.json
Depends on what you mean. If you are in the US, and willing to move to Boise, your nation of origin is largely irrelevant. (Save for work sponsorship if you aren't a permanent resident. I don't know my company's stance on that or the legal complexities.) If you mean you are still in Spain looking for remote work, probably not.
That’s ok, you win some, you loose some :)
Umm... English can be semantically ambiguous. It’s OK.
Or `... `...
don't waste your interview time testing him on code trivia. if he has a solid resume and has already passed some basic screening you would be far better served to use your precious limited interview time trying to figure out if this is a person you want to work with, who you feel like you can trust, and who will bring good energy to the team. 
these are bad questions imo. it's only testing if the candidate has memorized whatever particular trivia you decide to ask that day. 
If you make them write code, please give them a laptop and mirror their display on an external screen. I loathe whiteboard coding and most senior people do too.
Hello, no as far as I know this feature is not avaliable in jupyter lab nor the extension manager. For uou second question, yes, a simple "pip install jupyterlab" will allow you to run it, just open a terminal (or cmd/powers heel) and run `jupyter lab`
You show how to enable the user service at boot but that won't work unless you also `sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER`.
Yeah, so many of the gotchas go away at that level. If you want a micro controller to add two numbers together that is damn well the only thing it's doing right now.
See my replies from earlier. I'm a very strong proponent of architecture questions in most interviews.
Yeah I'm in Spain :(
What physics course is this that students may need to learn python? Is this some numerical analysis or something?
Nice tutorial. Even got to brush up on my German in the process. The code is nice and clean. Like the classymenu too. Some great ideas in there.
Learned quite a few things from this, the typing modeuls and it's extensions is getting some real nice traction!
&gt; A hashable object doesn't have to be immutable. Ah, I've finally figured out why a hashable object *must* be immutable. Let's make a hashable version of the usual mutable list: import collections class HashableList(collections.UserList): def __hash__(self): return hash(tuple(self)) We create a hashable list object and put it in a dictionary: &gt;&gt;&gt; h = HashableList([1, 2, 3]) &gt;&gt;&gt; d = {h: 'hello'} &gt;&gt;&gt; h, hash(h), d ([1, 2, 3], 2528502973977326415, {[1, 2, 3]: 'hello'}) It seems to work. We even make another hashable list with the same value and it seems to work too: &gt;&gt;&gt; d[h] 'hello' &gt;&gt;&gt; h2 = HashableList([1, 2, 3]) &gt;&gt;&gt; d[h2] 'hello' Now we change `h`. As expected, it creates a KeyError because the only key in the list is `[1, 2, 3]`: &gt;&gt;&gt; h[2] = 100 &gt;&gt;&gt; d[h] Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; KeyError: [1, 2, 100] **But here's the thing.** `h2` no longer works as a key, even though it is [1, 2, 3]: &gt;&gt;&gt; d[h2] Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; KeyError: [1, 2, 3] Why is this? Because the key in `d` isn't a *copy of the [1, 2, 3] object*, it's a *copy of the reference*. When we changed `h`, we also changed the dictionary key: &gt;&gt;&gt; d {[1, 2, 100]: 'hello'} So this means the key is now [1, 2, 100], but it's in the bucket/slot for [1, 2, 3]. But `h2`'s [1, 2, 3] won't work because the key is now [1, 2, 100] and Python just assumes it happens to be a hash collision. **To make things even worse**, try setting `h[2]` to `99`. By sheer coincidence, [1, 2, 99] hashes to the same bucket/slot as [1, 2, 3]. And the values are the same (because the key has also changed to [1, 2, 99], so it works perfectly fine: &gt;&gt;&gt; h[2] = 99 &gt;&gt;&gt; d[h] 'hello' So this is why it's a Bad Thing to have mutable items be hashable: changing them also changes the key in the dictionary. Sometimes this works even though it should cause a KeyError (when there's a hash collision by coincidence) and other times it'll cause a KeyError when it should work (because the dictionary key has changed when the mutable object has changed).
&gt; Do I need to call super().init() in my constructor (nobody seems to, but I can't find it documented)? No &gt; Did I understand the flow control mechanism correctly? Yes, pretty much. The idea of BufferedProtocol though is to allocate the buffer only *once* in your `__init__()` and return a specific `memoryview` over it from `get_buffer()`. &gt; What is a recommended value when sizehint in BufferedProtocol.get_buffer() is -1? [..] If you allocate you buffer in `__init__`, say 64kb, then you just return a view over the available space. How big the buffer should be? It really depends on the protocol. If you have a framed protocol and the average frame size is 4kb and you shouldn't have more than a few frames per req/resp 64 is a good choice. If you transfer megabytes per req/resp then you might need a bigger buffer. &gt; What should I do with the Exception exc in connection_lost()? Where would it come from? Ultimately your protocol supports some async/await facade (or some other high-level code). You're supposed to propagate that exception to that code. &gt; Currently I only use a single thread and loop. How could I extend this to multithreading in order to use multiple CPU cores? You wouldn't be able to because of the GIL. You should stick to one thread and one loop per OS process, and use multiprocessing to split your program in a few OS processes.
... And there's Ansible as well
You can also access the registers even if you are using arduino. It's just a library of helper functions but the base language is still C++.
&gt; This is totally true. The Python Data Model doc has this line: &gt; (The value of an immutable container object that contains a reference to a mutable object can change when the latter’s value is changed; however the container is still considered immutable, because the collection of objects it contains cannot be changed. So, immutability is not strictly the same as having an unchangeable value, it is more subtle.) I think this is a bit hand-wavey though; the doc author realizes the point but brushes it off with "it is more subtle". :) But I think it's so much simpler if we do go with "value is dictated by `__eq__()`" rather than the "immutable" and "deeply immutable" distinction. It strikes me as sort of "some immutable objects are more immutable than others" line of thinking. "Immutable" loses meaning. But sticking to "`__eq__()` dictates value", we can then say "hashable objects must be immutable" and avoid the "tuples are immutable but ignore what `a == b` says". Also, if someone says "The integer `1` and string `'1'` have the same value" we can say they are definitely wrong (in the context of Python ints and strs) just like if someone says "`True` and `1` are not the same value". I agree, the nuance doesn't matter to 99% of beginners. But I wonder which is more misleading: saying that all tuples are immutable and immutability and hashability is unrelated, or saying that some tuples are mutable and those tuples aren't hashable because only immutable objects can be hashable.
Check out [Pyro4](https://pyro4.readthedocs.io/) this allows you to more or less completely abstracts away network programming in your Python code by providing remote method calls.
What is often overlooked is that recv() may not return all bytes asked for. Even when it's not the end of the message. So you should always create a loop around it to make sure you get all bytes that you want. How do you know when the number of bytes you collected is the desired amount? That can be solved by using fixed size framing or variable sized framing using a header of some sort that indicates the number of bytes that follow. There are a lot of other intricacies as well to deal with to make this code robust. Bottom line: avoid using raw sockets, use an abstraction library instead (twisted, Pyro4, requests, whatever)
It’s physics and Astrophysics. This particular module is Electromagnetism with Computation
If the question about CPython, then Qt is very powerful. If you mean "python" as a language (independent of underlying implementation), then I would use Python on Java (Jython). You can interface your program with Java graphical libraries seamlessly, so you can use any java.awt or swift to make a GUI (plus no need to worry about platform dependence). 
Yes, look for `pywin32` and COM objects. Also r/learnpython
Try bringing num 1 and 2 outside if conditional :) or else you’ll copy and paste a lot of code 
I've never heard of this or QT before, but now this might be my main setup for building personal projects
I'd try /u/tLaw101's suggestion of trying to find the spydus API first if possible; selenium can be tempermental for slowly rendering pages. If it's possible to do it with just GET/PUT requests that would probably be both easier to set up, and more reliable.
I agree with you. I couldn't design an UI without a GUI, it's unnecesary difficult and annoying.
Mine is Physics Astro and cosmology - it’s an optional unit for us but Matlab is compulsory. Also, they make us use comp methods in other units like optics 
No they are gaping holes in my self-esteem.

I don't like using the label, but I suppose I actually am an "expert" on Django + Python. And as it happens, I have strong opinions about interviewing! First, the bad news: you can't develop a good interview process by tomorrow. I've worked on interview development a few times, and it tends to be something that takes months and a group of people working on it and multiple rounds of feedback from the team as a whole. Now, what are you going to do tomorrow? Here are some ideas for exercises that you can probably prep somewhat quickly: * Take some feature of your codebase. Something medium-sized. Boil it down into a one-paragraph description and hand it to your candidate. Ask them to treat that as a rough spec, and you as their coworker on building it, and go from there. This is *not* a code-writing exercise! It's a design and collaboration exercise. You're looking for them to ask clarifying questions, to come up with a reasonable design, to be able to communicate their choices and talk about tradeoffs involved, to listen to feedback you're offering and incorporate it, to explain how they'd break down the implementation into reasonable-sized chunks for individual developers to work on, etc. * Show up with a code sample and ask the candidate to do a review of it with you. This is also *not* a code-writing exercise! You're looking for them to probe into the code, to ask questions about why things were done a certain way before they criticize, to understand that not everything can be made perfect all the time, to come up with constructive suggestions that work in the context of a routine review/refactoring process, and to be able to communicate those things without being an asshole or a know-it-all. * Bring a problem you had to debug at some point. Give them just the initial symptoms you were aware of, and ask them to go from there. Let them mention tools or techniques they'd use and ask questions about what those would reveal. Look for how they think about the problem, how they try to dig down to root cause, how they gather information and make use of both technical and non-technical resources. In other words: think about what would make someone a successful member of your team, then do things that test for that. Asking a bunch of trivia or posing coding "challenges" will *not* test for the skills that actually matter on the job, so avoid those. Also, the more senior someone is, the more important it is to measure their effect on the rest of your team. What makes a good senior developer is not that they're some multiple more productive than everyone else; it's the effect they have on the productivity of everyone else.

I don’t know many developers who work with C++ the only devs I know who work with it are in hardware or are working at larger companies who want to customize kernels etc. That said most of my friends work at web companies (fb, google, twitter and the like). They use python, c#, java and php.

100% I keep seeing questions probing knowledge on specific concepts that are not required for many uses in response to "how to prepare for Python interview questions".
Is this the real expectation? My God, I am a one-man self taught programmer and I work in Django primarily. Aside from mapping out UML diagrams i couldn't possibly answer any of the questions you propose. However, I've built very comprehensive applications for healthcare and sales with pretty complex workflows. the systems manage the information flow and process tracking of many millions of dollars worth of business. these systems are secure, performance, and user friendly. does this mean I'm doing everything wrong and could never get a 'real' programming job? does anyone feel like theres a huge disconnect between what we say were looking for and what were really looking for?

Im teaching my code for what isn't the first time ever, but sure feels like it, given how little experience I have had with coding prior, and how rough such teaching environments were (Not newbie friendly!). I started this week writing a small little calculator for names and birthdays or whatever, and you could store this information in an array and call it out by index. I then moved on and used pygame to make a small music player, which was robust, but worked really well! &amp;#x200B; now I am trying to make an asteroids clone, and Im having a terrible time with it. Im just trying to get my ship to rotate.

OP, nice work. Can I throw you a bone? Consider using a Case structure to do that for you. Take a look: [https://jaxenter.com/implement-switch-case-statement-python-138315.html](https://jaxenter.com/implement-switch-case-statement-python-138315.html)
This is correct. Find out what the candidate has done in the past, and if it’s comparable to the challenges you face. Language junk can all just be googled and good devs I’ve known don’t necessarily care about it. 
Easy. But how easy depends on how you intend to accomplish this. Are you just going to automate the existing process (open a spreadsheet, search for inactive accounts, delete balance, etc) or are you going to change how the info is stored and processed (move info to a DB, create a program that manages the DB)? I would say the first way would be easier and not change how things currently work, but the second way would make your data storage and management a lot more sensible and easier to maintain long term. Either way, you're looking at a lot of trial and error, googling, stack overflow, and you'll probably take a month, maybe two, to complete and test a finished product doing it only with spare time
Watching videos isn’t going to teach you how to program. You need to write programs to do that. If you find that you are unable to write the programs you’re trying to write then it means you need to go back to writing simpler programs until those are easy. Go back to writing hello world and work your way up if needed.

In a tutorial, you know what you want to do. In the real world, you often don't.
In that respect, Is everyone lost, or does everyone problem solve and discuss what to do. Is there peers that are not as educated as others, or do the programmers usually have the same knowledge as one another. Thanks
this is a real question btw. I'm genuinely curious about whether or not I'm fooling myself into thinking I have any idea what I'm doing

Instead of loanamount -= (...), you could add a separate variable: newloanamount = loanamount - (...). Then compare newloanamount and loanamount. Also check out pep-8 for styling your code. Use of semicolons is not preferable as it makes your code less readable.

There are definitely peers who know more about programming in general, or a particular language or whatever problem they are working on. But that's not what I mean. What I'm talking about is algorithms. In a tutorial, they usually present a task and then present a solution and the tutorial is only about how to code that algorithm into the language. For instance: Task: "OK, so yeah, I've been getting a lot of questions about how to sort a list so I'm going to show you a really basic way to do that in Python." Solution: "We're going to run through the list over and over again and every time we find two items next to each other that are in the wrong order, we'll flip them." Coding: making loops, lists, doing exchanges, etc. In the real world, you sometimes aren't even given a clear task like the above, so you have to define that (talking to users, watching a system, identifying a problem or whatever). Once you do that, you need to design a solution that will address the task. Finally there's writing down that solution in a form the computer can execute (in Python, for instance) That last step is usually the easiest part and is also usually the only part covered in tutorials.

What kind of numerical calculation do you do in that field? Simulation? Simulation of (system of) differential equation?
Showing your code is not about believing or not believing you. Its to guide you on your own path, so you learn a lot from it.
Just deployed my first web application for testing (flask + SQLAlchemy + postgresql) . Online surveys for HR, table driven, results stored for later analysis. I was a midrange developer until I got tired of it (15 years...), this project is small, but it's rekindled my interest in coding and it feels good. :)
I'm just beginning this journey also. Are you working freelance or full time? 
Ask questions like this in /r/learnpython.
You can always install whatever dependencies by using a virtual environment. You hopefully have enough on the school computers to be able to set one up. As for ideas, you have an extremely limited amount of time to make something. Building an application is a _huge_ undertaking, so keep your scope modest. Find something that's tedious or difficult that can easily be automated and then automate it. A number of big splashes in the last decade were apps or sites that somehow connect people who otherwise would have found it much more difficult. At their core, that's all that Facebook, Uber, Craigslist, etc. were when they started. So, whatever you build doesn't really need to be all that complicated.
Do people actually ask questions on stackoverflow any more? I thought the last question that people thought might not be a duplicate was posted in 2017 and it was still marked as being a duplicate. Then it got voted down into oblivion because it was too controversial to have an actual new question on shitoverflow.

I'm not sure how popular my suggestion will be but If its for Excel, you may want to look at Javascript. Microsoft recently built a JS API for Excel. This will be a easy learning curve if you have no experience with Python. &amp;#x200B; [Here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/reference/overview/excel-add-ins-reference-overview) is MS's propaganda about JS in Excel.
Your code doesn’t run. What does the python version have to do with anything? Also, what’s with the list comprehensions? Make one array for that line instead of a list of arrays. Also, what are the shapes and what should they be? Finally, check out /r/learnpython 
You learn most by facing challenges. Come up with a complex pet project you can work on. Then add new features to it... Like sorting lists, etc. Google it and apply it. Just learning about sorting in a YouTube tutorial is great, but you will learn and retain a lot more if you apply it on your own to your own problems. 
NOTICE: I don't have any experience with Conda, or PyCharm (VIM programmer). &amp;#x200B; But two things you should: 1. Is Pycharm using Python 3.6 or another version? Go to your terminal/command prompt and type 'python3.6'. Then type 'from bs4 import BeautifulSoup'. Did it work? If so, then PyCharm is probably using the wrong version. 2. If it didn't work then you need to install the Beautiful Soup library with Python3.6. Easiest way to do this is with 'python3.6 -m pip install BeautifulSoup'....assuming you have pip.
There is a greater learning curve in the signal slot system, but it’s much more capable than using callbacks. It also is much more compatible cross-platform.
vim, not even joking. Once you learn the commands its becomes enjoyable.

I was going to say this. Sounds like Flask may be his answer.
Isnt Go still pretty new to have compatibility issues between versions? 
In my opinion, Python is a bad language to start learning about programming. But I can understand if this is just something you learn to help you with your physics course. Everyone who is serious about programming should start with C. C is where you really train your programming mindset.
Youtube for sure. Googling "Python Tutorial" will get you far as well. Once you start to grasp the basic concepts, the rest kind of falls into place. There's a certain beauty to Object Oriented programming when you get the hang of it.
cx_Freeze- Sentdex on YouTube made a video on this library. With this you can export as an exe and include media files and other python files.
OH! Thank you so much. This is exactly what I am looking for.
I was previously in a similar boat. I was working for the section 8 housing program. The section 8 program had a list of social security numbers for people on the program that had to be typed into a federal website to download their income sources from the social security administration (need government clearance to do this). This is done to prevent fraudulent income reporting for this low income housing program. Instead of spending hours for days at a time typing id numbers to save an income report one at a time, I wrote some python that would open up the web browser, navigate to the website, sign in, go to the right page to get the income report, search the id, print the result to PDF, and move that PDF to a network drive. I let the program run on my computer over night with the screen locked. This was one of the first programming projects I ever tried. I learned a ton. Everything I did was in that book, Automate the Boring Stuff. Great book! No, my program didn't work perfectly on my first try, but I got it working 95% of the time within a week or so and that was a huge time saver. And fwiw, I didn't stop with that project. I enjoyed doing so much that I kept going and now program in Python professionally making 4 times what I made back then. So yes, you can do it and it will totally be worth your time. Even if you don't want to become a professional programmer, you'll have a skill to "automate the boring stuff" with whatever job you end up in. Good luck!
I would pair programming with him on some real production code. It's an opportunity to see if you like his style and approach, technical and personal,and also a good way to start good conversions on design.
In Scala it's ...
You need the nest the if statement inside the while loop: while x &gt; 0: if x &gt; 10: print("greater than 10") else: x -= 1 + y print("greater than zero") 
You would have to indent your `if x &gt; 10:` block. As it is, x is always greater than zero, so `while x &gt; 0:` is never false, so you never leave the loop. If you don't leave the loop, you never get to the `if x &gt; 10:` block.
I would prefer the values to be lazy lambdas
You should alternate between studying and practicing. Before learning something, you should have an idea of why you want to learn it. For example, take learning physics. Instead of just reading the book or watching videos online for the sake of learning, you'll get further if you have an end goal like building a rocket. You know to start with learning about mechanics -- how things move. This will require you to learn about gravity and Newton's laws of motion. After you learn some theory, you can start to practice by calculating angles for projectiles and trying to build something that uses those ideas like a catapult. Then you'll want to make a better catapult, or maybe a bigger one, or maybe one that uses chemical force (like a rocket). You'll need to learn more about how those things work, but as you do you can incorporate than back into you project and keep trying to improve or build new things. Programming is the exact same way. It's mostly useless to just know language syntax without having anything to say. Come up with some things you'd like to use python to do. Here's a few simple ideas to get you started: - create a blog - rename and tag your photos (or music or videos) - automatically send an email (or text or Facebook message) to your friends on their birthday - automate some menial task at work - write a game like tetris or pacman or a choose your own adventure text - keep track of prices online for things your can buy and resell for profit If you have an idea what you want to get to, you'll be better able to appreciate what you're learning. I recommend starting with the free, online book, Automate the Boring Stuff. It will help teach you python by having you build little tools as you go. Once your done with it, you should have little trouble figuring out new projects to try and new things to learn in python and computer science. https://automatetheboringstuff.com
Why list comprehensions are faster than for loops. To explain why threads in python are not run concurrently.
You probably have multiple python executables on your system (on a development machine, if you don't, you're doing something very wrong). PyCharm will pick one by default, probably the system python 2.7; Anaconda will have installed another one, probably in your userspace. If you're using a conda environment or virtualenv (which you should), there'll be more. Go into the PyCharm settings for your project and search for "Project Interpreter". There are a few menus to go through but broadly, you need to point it at the python executable which is associated with the python environment which has beautifulsoup installed in it.
You can do everything in Python and use [this](https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/#) to gen the Excel sheets.
y?
What's your goal? I've been working on something similar to lexers/parsers. I'm basically just using regexes and and an algorithm that I think would be classified as a "state machine".
hey post to /r/learnpython and check out [http://automatetheboringstuff.com/](http://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
No it basically it tries to like The Posts of people that have liked your pictures and then adds them to a list and likes their posts and the cycle goes on and this way you get organic attention and most probably likes and follows back :) it is still under dev and i will be adding commenting features aswell
Just use multiprocessing to divide the inputs over all available cores? Not sure there’s a better way in Python.
And there are some really excellent tools for making command line interactive interfaces in python as well. But for a rough first draft input is fine.
It might be more elegant, but aren't you doing unnecessary operations? I guess we're not going for efficiency here, though. And it's not like the extra operations take long lol
If you run it outside of the terminal you are starting a python process to run the program. When the interpreter has no more instructions it exits. If you want the window to stay add another input with “press any key” type instruction. 
It’s unclear what it is asking. Does it just want you to print to console? Why is there an email message and a phone message?
It was in the first example from OP.
I think the question is asking to use three functions to print out these statements. The problem is when I try to do it it goes out of order.
Dict lookups are O(1).
I made this choice a few weeks ago... I am choosing Python for the following reasons: 1)I've done some work in R and I couldn't make the outputs look as nice as quickly as I could with Python. 2) you're seeing advancements in deep learning (keras, pytorch, tensor flow) that are not as apparent in R. 3) Python integrates with with the web / mobile. Your style of learning matters. I've got more of a programmer brain so R didn't seem easier.
Yea I'm assuming it's asking for arbitrary functions with those prints in them. I.e.) def email_print(): print('stuff') Etc. [W3](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp) has a good starting guide if this is what you're looking for
Well what order are you calling the functions in? def funcA: print("blah blah") def funcB print("blah blah 2") def funcC print("blah blah 3") funcA() funcB() funcC() Should print in the order A, B, C...
I’ve been using Parallel, that is part of multiprocessing I’d say. I guess my code is too demanding and the cluster is too busy. Thanks anyway!
1- The while loop will never ends because **x** will always be &gt; 0. 2- What do you think this piece of code does?: `x -= 1+y` You might be expecting a negative result but it's positive, look: x = 2 y = -2 so 1+ y --&gt; 1 + (-2) Then x -= 1+y ---&gt; x -= 1 + (-2) x -= -1 ---&gt; Because 1+(-2) = -1 x = x-(-1) x = 2-(-1) x = 3 Also You won't break the `while` loop with the `if` because if x &gt; 10 then x still is &gt; 0. Logic. &amp;#x200B;
not that I know, ask the other team to provide you the necessary info
The fact that it mentions, "phone message" and "email message" as distinct makes me feel that there's supposed to be some distinction there
check in pycharm the project interpreter, see if it lists bs4
&gt; The slightly more pathological strategy is to ask questions about useful, but advanced (and therefore less-used) features of Python. Metaclasses, stateful decorators, stateful generators, implementing arithmetic over arbitrary object types using `__add__` &amp;c. I'm not a SWE, but a "data scientist" (scare quotes because that's not exactly accurate, but it's my title) and I've been using Python for about 2.5 years. I have a little experience with other programming langs, but I mostly just use Python. I don't really think most of these things are expert-level if asked point-blank. I can answer most of these quite thoroughly, and I'm definitely no senior or expert, and I don't even use most of this stuff day to day since I'm not a SWE. I think you would really probe whether someone knew these things by asking them a question where a metaclass or stateful decorator or whatever was really a *much* more elegant solution than not using them, and see if they come up with the solution to use said feature by themselves. But even then, those solutions would seem way too esoteric to use in an interview. I'm wary about that kind of stuff after a FAANG interview where the interviewer thought that `x or y` evaluates to a boolean in Python. Anyways I just wanted to point out that those questions may still be answerable by someone more junior if asked point-blank, and if asked indirectly, may not give you an answer someone would actually use, because of the setting.
I honestly really, really hate both white board coding and on the spot coding. It's not how I work, and I've literally completely flubbed an interview over something simple (CSV parsing!) because I had to do it live and freaked out.
I use VS as my preferred editor. 
Right but if hypothetically is y = a positive number, then x would be greater than 10 eventually. How would you go about adding the 'if' statement within the while loop to stop it from increasing past 10? 
All of what you are talking about "may" weed out python "experts" from who exactly? Everything you mentioned has nothing to do with that is most important about python... getting things done. Why should anyone care about familiarity with obscure patterns and their relationship to a particular language. Even an expert would have to just happen to have specific experience with that particular pattern for that to mean anything. As to the git suggestions. All I want to know is that someone knows how to write a good commit message, that they know to commit often, that they know how to do basic merges and basic work flow. So once again, I'm not sure what you are trying to learn about someone by your suggestions. All your suggestions seem to target separating language experts and techno experts from those who are not. But I've met some people who could create a large functioning project in python with good clean design that probably know very little of anything you mentioned. They are still experts at getting shit done with python though. You would have weeded out every single one of them for no reason.

So my first thought process on how to accomplish this would be to generate a fibonacci sequence up to a certain value (such as this page is showing): https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/examples/fibonacci-recursion And modify it so that it just gives you the last value instead of all of them. You should be able to figure out how to do that.
I guess what I'm asking is, if there a way to tell the logic "while x &lt; 0 , execute function and print ("a"), but if x &gt; 0, print("b") ". hypothetically if I changed the value of y. 
That's normal. Run it in the terminal.
Ask him, * Data structure, difficulty from basic to medium * Algorithm, difficulty from basic to medium * Basic mathematic * If he knows C++, some basic C++ knowledge. Java or C# are fine too. (can't believe a so called "expert" only knows one language). * Something about team work. The core idea is, a so called "Python expert" is not a real expert if he only knows Python. He has to know computer science and other languages. And if he calls himself "expert", I doubt if his attitude is humble enough and whether he knows himself quite well. 
You can add: delay = input("Please press ENTER to end the program. ?") That'll stop the program from closing until you press enter.
Nobody is going to do your homework for you. What part are you having a problem with? Show what you've got so far and someone might show you the next step.
Seriously, noone will do your homework for you. You have to show that you've put a least a tiny modicum of thought into it. If you can't do that, programming might not be for you.
Hey, probably find better help over in /r/learnpython, but there are some tips in this thread [here](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/9504). Might be a firewall on your network if you're using a school or work one.
I would recommend having stuff like (D)ivide and (S)ubtract in your prompts and then just test for user\_input == "D" or user\_input == "S". This requires the user to type less and is much more pleasant to use. &amp;#x200B;

This issue does not really have anything to do with Python. For many programming languages, there will be different ways to execute programs written in the language. When a program does only console I/O\[1\], some of these execution methods will exit immediately when the program is finished, while others will prompt the user to press Enter (or something like that) to end the program. I teach computer programming, and when I distribute example code to my students, I nearly always add a "Press Enter to Quit" prompt at the end, so that people do not have the troubles you are having. You can do the same by following the advice given by /u/wynand1004. \[1\] Console I/O is text-only input &amp; output of the kind you are most likely doing.

I prefer using Sharex. I have it configured to where ctrl+shift+printscreen = gif, and ctrl+shift+c = image. Soon as I hit the button it will open a region selector so I can snap a part of the screen like snipping tool. When I'm done if it's an image I have it set to open a quick menu so I can just copy, do a quick edit (blur / red box to draw attention) or copy it to clipboard OR even upload it and copy the URL automatically. If it's a gif it just uploads and copies url. Took all the work out of making gifs / screenshots. Ctrl+shift+key and then ctrl+v and you're done.
Can I suggest checking out https://github.com/ChrisKnott/Eel? It sounds like you might have missed it in your discovery phase, as I reckon it does exactly what you want. 
Thanx.
There were a bunch of known issues with routing and stuff last time I tried.

I mean, Dash simply sits ontop of Flask. You can create a normal Flask app where just one of the pages is a Dash app, or incorporate pieces of both. The Dash HTML components give you all the normal HTML stuff to structure a page. I haven't built a full-on site with Dash (seems kinda silly tbh), but I have made an intranet site with different dashboards and such with it.
Why not just use python in your terminal? When ever I want to test something really quick I just type in python an write some lines 
Thanks man. I got it working. I gotta buy you a beer. Saying the words selenium and cronjob saved me a lot of time. 
in my case, it is not possible to use python in a terminal a playground is exactly what i need 
What? Why? You can try jupyter
Or, um, copy and paste the code lol.
what i want is an online playground, which can give me a link to the document i wrote in it before and a few buttons like the run button

This is just a binary object. To convert to base64 there are multiple ways, check this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5305456/python-how-do-i-convert-from-binary-to-base-64-and-back
But all the values are computed when the dictionary is constructed. Could solve using lambdas or function references, but that's probably overkill here as those computations are cheap.
I am so pleasantly surprised this is the top comment; never a truer word has been spoken. Things to test for other than trivia: - how do they respond to critical feedback on their code? - how do they act when being questioned on a technical decision they made? - does the candidate show a good understanding of trade offs given some known constraints? Does the candidate put shipping over infinitely refactoring? - how does the candidate communicate via the written form? Most of what we do as developers is communicated this way: Slack, PRs, Code, Code comments, Git history, etc, etc. Verbal communication skills and charm are not enough. - how much emotional intelligence is witnessed? Could the candidate be put in front of a client alone without going technically over the top or promising the world? - do they have any mentoring experience? A senior developers most important job is to mentor those below in terms of experience. Just some to get you started. Hope it helps.
Standard library has a Base64 module. http://docs.python.org
 ``` f= open("Myfile", "wb") : f.write(mybytes) f.close() ``` Myfile is the name of the file you want Exemple : something.png or lol.mp3 Mybytes is all the bytes you can see. If you pick the right extension file you'll be able to open the file properly 
thx. that will do
Yes, the dict values would be function references. You'd only have to define it once (outside the loop).

I am not sure why some comments talk about the word expert as something special? Any senior Python programmer can call themselves Python expert. Personally I would not use that word because I always consider what I know to be something everybody knows but expert is not a word that means you know more than everybody else but if a programmer are very proficient in a language, there is nothing wrong with calling themselves an expert.
I love vim, but only as an editing mode. There are things that you need in a complex development environment that are just precious and make your work a lot more efficient. vim is an editor, not an IDE.
The problem is that it's not easy to understand. IntelliJ is sold as a Java IDE, not as a multilanguage IDE. In my opinion they have a bad marketing strategy on this regard.
Seems to be text with some nice encoding. I'll defer to u/kumashiro's comment as for the conversion you want.

Sure, why not. However, the main advantage of PLC is real-time operation. Even if you curb garbage collector in Python, underlying interpreter and OS still won't guarantee you anything spectacular. Maybe it’s a little different with those Python Arduino-like boards (I have no experience with them)?

Yeah, and confused more by the name-changes. It used to be called "IntelliJ", now it's called "IntelliJ IDEA" - does that clue you into what the software actually does? Probably not.
Good find, that looks very relevant! As I said, I'm sure it has been done before and propably been done better. I'm not a big fan of embedding python code in HTML though.
that is cool. real engineers can learn programming, but programmers cannot learn engineering
True. I suppose if need be you could build a pc board like an Adurino. I never gave those any thought. They're cheap and, from what I hear, are easy to work with. More pondering to do. 😀
No one is going to be willing to do ur homework for you. If u can tailor ur questions to be more specific such as "what kind of loop should I use for this" or "what kind of data structure should I store a threat/move as" I'm sure our friends at stack overflow will be willing to help
Yes but the maintainers have explicitly said that have no intention whatsoever to break comparability with V2. 
Thanks man! Engineering’s like everything else, easy to do, hard to do well 👍
My sincere congratulations. This is only the beginning.
I agree! It’s bumped my motivation up once again! Thank you!
Very cool! I like string formatting. :) Do you know this: ```Python result = num1+num2 print("The answer is {}".format(result)) ``` Second hint in jupyter you can type ?function to directly access the docstring of the function.

For the 1 go, it takes about 90s to parse and plot (run the program). No idea if that’s good or bad, but my bae for success was doing it faster than excel, which succeeded by a large margin haha
Uh considering engineer is a pretty tossed around title these days you should specify or your comment doesn’t make any sense. Software engineer anyone?
typing code does not make you an engineer. sorry
Congrats. Also mech e's are not dumb.
Awesome

This dude is proud of his achievement. Don't hijack it so you can fire into a dick measuring contest.
How did you get then to install python? Was it the full anaconda?
Yes, I used Anaconda 3 with pycharm. We’re a small company, so I just told our IT guy I needed it, and he let me install it. 
Should only be a few seconds.
Pretty good but could probably be made faster. Not too long ago i wrote a Rust program to do some fairly complex csv processing and it processes around 1-2GiB/sec
"Typing code" is the easiest part of software engineering. And there definitely are people out there only qualified to do that much. But I don't call those people software engineers.
Thanks for the clarification! I've updated the tutorial to mention this point.
Holy shit. That’s awesome. I remember on here a while back I found a post about a library a few months ago that was supposed to substantially speed up pandas interaction with csvs (can’t remember the name now). I was going to try to revamp my code to take advantage of it, but I could never get the library to work for me. What’s Rust?
I wrote the contrary thing you said
Congrats bud! I have no clue about what layout you're using but since it takes ~90 seconds I can recommend using tqdm as a progress bar, if you're in need of one that is. It's dead simple :)
I’ll check into it! I haven’t heard of that feature. Please keep the suggestions coming to help make it more sporty! Thank you!
You're absolutely right! I wrote this tutorial while figuring out how to do this, and I was expecting that more work on the Python side would be required (e.g. manual forking via [python-daemon](https://pypi.org/project/python-daemon/)). Turns out that there's not much to do on the Python side aside from unbuffering STDOUT/STDERR and using `python-systemd` to notify systemd when startup is complete -- a pleasant surprise :)
Rust is a programming language. It's generally a bit harder than python but has the speeds of C and lots of good libraries. 
If you want some pointers on the code you can PM me it and I'll see what I can do! 
I work at a fairly large company on hardware, and we use both Python and C++. Anything interacting with low-level stuff (particularly SOC's) gets written in C++, but only exposing a minimal subset of functions that are used over an IPC bus by Python code only (our applications).
Like LEGO for kids and rockets for politicians, Python is perfect for the curious mind. 
Ignorance is a hell of a drug.
Ok great, I'm excited! I'm doing some Udemy/ Lynda courses and as a beginner it feels so overwhelming, like I'll never really get the hang on it, but I guess the key is to stick at it! :) 
I am a MechE that writes python scripts too! I have automated some of our workflows completely (e.g. alter model dimensions, run FEA, extract results of specific measures, plot change in measures against the change in model dimensions). It is so satisfying to set up a problem, hit run on a Friday afternoon, and then come in on Monday to a dataset that tells you what the optimal design based on your constraints is. Keep going!
While Rust is fast, it sounds like you have access to a much faster disk.
Awesome man! Thank you, and will do!
Depending on how you are parsing the data, you can also use Cython to speed up processing.
For parallel processing libraries that integrate well with pandas, check out Dask or vaex. For on-disc storage, check out apache parque format.
Arduinos programmed in C and RPi programmed in Python is a match made in heaven. You can go really far with this setup. 
Those are the moments we live for.
Right on! Don't discount the usefulness of knowledge. 
Pandas read Argument "engine='c' " helped me to speed it up even more. See https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html
There's something wrong with your code if you need to jump back to another line. Can you copy/paste it here?
I can’t say I had to, but once I found a really nice use case for factory metaclasses for multithreading. I don’t remember the details right now, but it fitted like a hand into a glove. 
next time look into power query in excel
This is awesome! I'll never forget the first time I was able to use Python in a work setting. I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to make it work or not. It was so rewarding when it did work and sped up the manual process the company was using!
Thank you! It is a really cool feeling once you’re past the uncertainty 😀
It really is! And I know what you mean about what it does for your motivation. Once you've proven to yourself that you can do it, you feel like you can code anything and want to build everything you can think of! Congrats on your first professional project! I'm sure you will have many more.
This is the powerful use of python. Sorting. Makes it quick to do something long. 
Dude, idk why but your post made me real happy, idk why dude, i just feel real happy.
Hahaha, that’s great! Glad I could brighten your day. 👍
&gt;It's generally a bit harder than python I love Rust, but "a bit harder" is quite an understatement.
&gt;(e.g. alter model dimensions, run FEA, extract results of specific measures, plot change in measures against the change in model dimensions) Abaqus? Ansys?
Awesome job! Next maybe load the data to a postgresql db and look into getting your company out/off excel and ms. &amp;#x200B; If you don't already know anything about docker you could be learning that easily and host your postgresql in it. &amp;#x200B;
Small companies rock like that. I have a friend at a larger company who isn't allowed to install python, and he could use it in the same way you did.
Use it? all the time. They are everywhere. Code them? sometimes, rarely. Mostly the idea of metaclasses is that you create a framework for code that is more declarative in nature. It mostly depends on the style of programming you want to achieve.
thx this is even better
Give me a high five ✋🏾 I started to learn pandas. Much to learn too!
You mean the REPL? Which compiles a bit of code and then runs it? Or you mean that you can do `python myfile.py` instead of python-compiler myfile.py python-vm myfile.pyc ?
You got it! 🖐
You can install Anaconda without admin rights, maybe that'll work?
You should check official python *csv* [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/csv.html). Some examples also found [here](https://realpython.com/python-csv/).
well done ! I'm in love with pandas too, since I met it excel look so 'meh'. 
Kind of like describe i this link :[https://www.splunk.com/blog/2017/04/18/deep-learning-with-splunk-and-tensorflow-for-security-catching-the-fraudster-in-neural-networks-with-behavioral-biometrics.html](https://www.splunk.com/blog/2017/04/18/deep-learning-with-splunk-and-tensorflow-for-security-catching-the-fraudster-in-neural-networks-with-behavioral-biometrics.html)
this is the best thing every happend to me !!!
So it removes the organic element of actually responding to people who like your stuff. 
Congrats! I’m an electronics tech who has had a recent flash of “Hey, I’m getting pretty good this!” too. I use raspberry pi’s to collect production metrics at my manufacturing site.
i have worked on pandas for the last few weeks and i can tell you that it is one of the best.
Been here. This is why VBA is still useful despite being a horrible language. Was there talk about Microsoft building python back end in to the office products? 
Congrats! This is an awesome start of your journey and I'm sure you're going to do loads of great things with your python skills in the future :)
When building GUI's in tkinter the suggested usage is via metaclasses. A lot of the time the functionality of a frame is related to it's contents, so it's common to just build your own sub-class of tkinter.Frame and build attributes and methods related to the frames contents 
Pymodbus is a place to start. You can hook up a Raspberry Pi and run a script to act as a PLC. The construction and possibilities of it is endless. But the Pymodbus can write to a register on a device to turn on and off items. Devices can be connected via Ethernet, Serial, etc. The learning curve to Pymodbus is a little rough but you can easily get the documentation and would suggest doing something simplistic like changing the register value and getting the value will help you learn and realize how simple and easy it can be. 
That's awesome! I first had this moment in university, when I wrote an app (with C#) for myself and my course mates which saved us each around 8 hours of manual clicking, copying, pasting, formatting and so on. And I assure you, your "career" as a programmer will only go upwards from this point :D Good luck!
It's quite hard to advise something without seeing any code. But I think what you want to do is split your code into smaller functions and just call a function as many times as you need to.
Do you have the project up on github? Would love to check it out myself
Yeah, at the beginning it can throw you a bit. I started, like many, treating Python like Basic and programming in a linear fashion, one instruction after the other. Then I found out about defining functions and creating a main loop. Objects with \_\_init\_\_ functions confused me, until I looked up what was going on, saw some beginner tutorials and it opened everything up and got my creative juices flowing hard. [Here's one about creating Objects \(Classes\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDa-Z5JzLYM) that'll give you a bit of a start. Obviously, not all Youtube tutorials are created equal, so check a few out until you find someone you can comprehend easily. For instance, I think TheNewBoston has [a great tutorial about PyGame](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAjkwJocj7vlc_mFU-4wXJq), that even if you don't want to use PyGame, it will give you a good understanding of a basic run loop. Best of luck! The early growing-pains are worth it. :D
The reason why no one is truly helping you is because this is considered a basic question for beginner python. Your problem requires the user to input 2 numbers, calculate length, and output to the screen. &amp;#x200B; psuedocode: get velocity from user get acceleration from user calculate length output length to screen &amp;#x200B; So you need to research on how to get input from a user in python. I will not answer it since it is an easy find through Google. That truly is the hardest part of this assignment. &amp;#x200B; Now if you have to error handle it. Then you need to do a step further. Making sure the values input into the program are numeric. Your length is needed to be a float value. So if your output is like 100 / 35 = 2, your answer is coming up as an integer, not a float. Python 3 does not do this but I cannot remember if 2.7 needs it or not. If your output is always an integer, you need to typecast your values as a float so your math output is a float. Again, this is a Google thing. &amp;#x200B; Good luck with the assignment and stick with Python. 
I would go for the main.py approach, then you can also use result status and exception handling 
I did the same thing, and even turned it I to a windowed app with pyside2 so that it is super easy to use. Of course, no one at my work actually uses it but me.
My thoughts too, sounds good, ta
That's really cool!
the real limit when parsing is the speed at which your computer can "read" (ie load into ram) a file. if you want to know what's this speed for your computer with python you can do a quick test, just ask python to open it and do a .read() that you store into a string, see how much time it takes. (unless the file is too heavy for your ram in which case it's more complicated).
Like /u/alkasm said, Dash sits on top of a web framework. Flask is the default, I use Django with [django-plotly-dash](https://django-plotly-dash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). The abilities I get from Django (users, admin, access, other views, etc.) I did not want to figure out in Dash alone.
/r/learnpython Bytes and strings are conceptually very different, even if they look the same on the surface. Bytes are essentially a list of numbers between 0-255. You can represent those numbers using characters, but they're not characters, they're numbers. Strings are how you work with characters in python. Sure, strings are represented internally as bytes (not ascii encoded though), but the same is true of every other data-structure on a computer. Broadly speaking, you use bytes to interact with computers, and strings to interact with humans.
In a lot of cases python libraries are backed with C code. For special example, numpy is a plethora of optimized C mathematics and should be used for scientific work.
From my experience of building an app for my college You shouldn't reveal the existence of such an app to others or superiors. You will get nothing for your efforts and they will use your work without compensating you
From experience, programs like these have authentication in the background. So querying the API might not work unless he finds what he needs to authenticate. I tried this with a library software we used here few month's back. Managed to find the endpoints but everything needed authentication. 
Overall all your script is a single app, you did well by spleting them, but definitely the first comment is the best approach. 
Yeah, good way to view it, cheers
From [http://www.jython.org/](http://www.jython.org/) : &gt;Jython 2.7.0 Final Released (May 2015) Is it relevant today?
Ironically, I work on both small and medium-ish codebases right now (nothing too huge) for business critical stuff. I've heard from a lot of people how static typing is necessary for this type of thing. My personal take is that static typing would prevent a very small number of bugs, whereas a dynamic/loose language like python coupled with good practices (automated testing, good design) would catch many more. I'm sure there's a place for static/low-level languages, but it's becoming much less a part of my career. And this coming from someone who used to do ASM in BASIC :)
one clarification - rockets are interesting only to male politicians, cause phallic object and because compensating for lack of character. 
Starting a pet video game project in between studying for exams in CS. Found out about Pygame but as far as I can tell it's not a must so I'll hold off on learning about that.
Look up instapy if you want a bot.
I think metaclasses are almost never the right choice versus a class decorator. For example, Django’s metaclasses make subclassing a pain in the ass, but if they had used a class decorator (which didn’t exist at the time), it would be trivial.

What's the difference in speed versus excel? Like milliseconds or minutes? 
Github repo: [https://github.com/vietnguyen91/QuickDraw](https://github.com/vietnguyen91/QuickDraw) Because of some reasons, I deleted my old github account and moved all repos to a new one. This post is just for re-introducing one of my repo, which I shared recently
One language that's very similar to python in some ways but comes pre-installed on every Windows computer is PowerShell. So he doesn't need to install Python specifically, can do the same thing in PowerShell which is built-in.
This is my dream, but I don't know if I'll ever achieve it. I started learning Python last week because I've always had an interest in programming and I'm good at "connecting the dots", like "oh, [this] tool can help me with [that] task". I hope I'll have the opportunity to use it professionally. I'm afraid, though, that for it to actually be useful, I'll have to get pretty advanced at using Python. 
The problem is the ValueError, and it seems that the new numpy treats shapes (2,) and (2,1) differently in the newer versions. I haven't found the solution yet, but thanks for the subreddit!
Cron cannot handle dependencies, so those need to be handled in the script being called. You can create the main.py but you could also just create a shell script that is the main runner program run.sh or start.sh
How big are the csv files?
I hate interviewing too - but if I have to code live, I'd rather it was on a computer instead of a whiteboard. I'm comfortable, don't feel super exposed and I can run my code to check my logic flow is right. It also shows someone's work style much better and more realistically than whiteboard coding.
Congratulations on your new position, Python Automator. Once everyone gets wind of your new skills you might have a few requests coming down the line
No problem man, glad you solve your problem :)
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. That's something neither of us [being Linux guys] have had any real experience in.
Numpy follows standard matrix dimension rules for matrix multiplication. That has not changed. Your shapes need to be correct and you can reshape your array to do so. Going back to the lists, one issue with that is you’re creating 1d arrays instead of 2d arrays. 1d arrays can be used say in a matrix solve despite the vector not being N x 1 and have some other edge cases that are useful, but can be misused, but it will run. If you have a 2d array, it needs to be the right shape.
Awesome! This could be a stupid comment, but do you save the plots? Matplotlib can do that pretty easily. If you do, you'll only need to run the script once instead of every time somebody wants to see the plots. Other than that, I can only praise your efforts! Keep the good stuff going! 
From my (limited) experience with net apis an header with the authentication key should suffice
Edit. Of course, if OP is at the “hello world” stage and has no experience in data handling then he’ll surely need a lot of patience and someone who can help
[remi](https://github.com/dddomodossola/remi) Also helps with some of this stuff 
I just started to programm a text based adventure. I'm totaly new to programming at all. I would love to create a game like the first episode of "Storys Untold". This game gave me goosebumps. I start to read the book "Make Your Own Python Text Adventure" by Phillip Johnson. It is a good start i guess but not really the thing I looked for. If somebody can help me how i can create a text based adventure with pics and stuff (like Storys Untold) i would appreciate it. Maybe a recommendation for a good book... &amp;#x200B; Nice weekend to all...
Wow! That's impressive
&gt;All of what you are talking about "may" weed out python "experts" from who exactly? People who have an ego proportionate to their skillset.
Try posting in /r/learnpython, this sub isn't for programming help. Also - you will almost definitely need to post code for anyone to help you with this.
Very nice!
Thanks so much! Turns out, I didn't need enumerate at all (and it was actually pretty simple)! Before I got to that simpler solution, though, I did manage to get enumerate to compare tiles, even though I'm still not sure _why_ my weird technique worked, lol :)
That's actually very cool. Great job!
You could create a plot in matplotlib and iterate through the rows in the data frame updating the plot in real time. Look up how to update matplotlib plots dynamically. 
Isn’t class decorator a sugar for metaclass? 
&gt; No idea if that’s good or bad What's "good" for anyone here doesn't matter. Is 90s acceptable for you? I'd imagine a resounding yes, given my experience with Excel's sluggishness on managing large files. Only thing I'd say, as a right noob compared to most here, if you need to scale to larger data sets, you might have some success using a sql system in there (sqlite is baked into python, or something like mysql/mongodb depending on your needs). If your dataset size will remain as is, throw a header in there saying what the program is, version, and who made it. Make them stare your superiority in the face on every job!
You have a Windows problem, not a Python problem. When you run `help()`, the Python interpreter tries to pass the help text to the Windows `more` command. For some reason, that command isn't on your path. What happens when you try to run `more` from the same Windows command prompt that you start Python from?
&gt; has the speeds of C Not in the sense of nitpicking, but I've seen "up to" 50% the speed of C for decently large processing. Certainly faster than native Python, but still not the gold standard. Depending on what OP's needs are, his solution might be good enough. I'd be curious what other optimization could be made inside Python. If we're talking 200 lines of code on someone's first project, it's probably about as efficient/optimized as everyone else's first project. 
Another thanks for the module/package pointer. 
I typed &gt;&gt;&gt;more Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; NameError: name 'more' is not defined
I asked what happens when you run `more` at the Windows prompt (`C:\foo&gt;`), not the Python prompt (`&gt;&gt;&gt;`).
It gives me the same 'more' is not recognized... Though I tried to just use help(S) and it called and returned telling me that it couldn't find documentation for 'Spam' Then I followed its instructions to use help(str) for more info on strings class. It then returned the 'more' error message again. So the help() is working halfway? Dunno if it's relevent
Thank you so much, you put me in the right direction. There was a bug, pause_reading/resume_reading are methods of Transport (of course), this is the revised code: class ProxyTunnelConnection(asyncio.BufferedProtocol): def __init__(self, partner_transport): self.partner_transport = partner_transport self.recv_buf = memoryview(bytearray(4096)) def connection_lost(self, exc): self.partner_transport.close() def get_buffer(self, sizehint): return self.recv_buf def buffer_updated(self, nbytes): self.partner_transport.write(self.recv_buf[: nbytes]) def eof_received(self): self.partner_transport.close() return False def pause_writing(self): self.partner_transport.pause_reading() def resume_writing(self): self.partner_transport.resume_reading() 
I like this idea. Tremble at my superiority!!! Hahaha
 We’re talking hours. It’s not just that excel takes around 20 mins to open the files, it’s that there are millions of data points that are often not necessary for the information we actually need 90% of the time. Add to that the time to work with a sluggish worksheet to parse and plot data, it saves a ton of effort (and frustration). 
Stick with it! You’ll find uses for it where you never thought it would be necessary/usable. 
I don’t, because I just clip the images into a test report, but yes, I actually have that functionality programmed in and commented out right now. A very useful feature to have it generate pngs!
Nice. The last project I did was on PyQt4 (or PySide version1 of you will) I went quickly over your code. Yes. It's basic and easy. However, your app runs all in single thread. Not that it would be an issue. However you are really going to start having "fun" with PySide/PyQt when you end up needing non-blocking UI, background threads, or toughest sucker or them all - multiprocessing module to (securely) separate memory areas, or of you need to interact with some other, external processes. Then you will need to use signals. And you also can't get away from using signals when you want some other threads to modify UI elements that are not within current active UI event's context. I was about to give up twice when trying to get all aforementioned things properly working. It was a learning curve, I'll give you that. Good luck to all! :) 
Hey this is great, thanks for sharing, is it possible to do it also for playlists? or only songs
Is there any information about how this implementation supports C interpreter API?
Fellow Mechanical Engineer here! I know it's often not easy to apply programming at work, but you will be recognized for those. In our profession it is easy to be the only one with programming skills ;). Data analysis is big for me too. Seaborn is a really useful thing. I also do Monte Carlo simulations now and then. Statistical tolerance stack-up is much easier this way. I also made a simulator for product utilisation and RnM cost. Congrats on your success!
This. Python programs doing a lot of I/O can be on par with other programming languages. Most of the time, external factors determine the speed
Name your file something else, naming it turtle.py will cause problems due to loading the module with the same name.
Thanks! It works now.

Learning is great. FYI. You won't be able to apply this out of a Masters Program, cause you are a "Master's Student" and this task is left to the PhD grads that Many Asset Management firm hire straight out of school who are good at it plus have production quality coding practices. There is no incentive to just learn Machine Learning Part. Put focus on Production Quality Coding equally. If you are really good, you might get a good chance at banks and trading firms where I am pretty sure, all the models have been already implemented and you'll be doing maintainance on them. Quantitative Finance is a great entry path, from there it's all how you shape your career. Having a Quant Finance degree distinguishes you from a general ML/DS/CS with DS specialization degree. So please think on those lines. If you were to learn ML with Finance focus and try to incorporate the new Gen "p-quant" positions, that would the best bet. But having a solid understanding of other Quant concepts will only alleviate these Learnings. Take a step back, think wisely. Talk to people in the industry as to what their day to day is, and if they ever get to apply these ML techniques to trading and if that has worked for them. How are they using it, and in conjunction what should be the best way to learn it. No one is going to divulge a lot of details, but you'll get a fair idea. A Strats, Quant Analyst, Financial Engineer, Quant Researcher, Algo Quant are all good positions you can start with out of a Masters program in Quantitative Finance. Also the ability to write production quality code and ability to understand and implement these complex models that actually trade in the real world markets makes you a 2 in 1 combo, which also makes your worth increase 2X. Also a lot of stuff is written in C++. And obviously you can have Python wrappers on top of it. But some thing to be aware of. Good luck. 
There was no difference in Python 2. In Python 2, strings used to be... well, kind of like arrays. They weren't really arrays, they were more like B-trees actually, but that's less relevant to your question. However, there's a popular (while dubious quality) standard: Unicode. It seems to have won the hearts and minds of programmers around the globe. The point of this standard is to "abstract" characters from their encoding. I don't know why they thought it would be useful, but... the facts are, a lot of people think that it is useful, and so Unicode is, virtually, everywhere. Python 2 used to provide support for this standard using `unicode` class. In Python 3, the infatuation with Unicode grew into a full-blown cult. Born again Python thinks that there are no strings except Unicode and that Python 3 is its messenger. Ashamed of its own heathen past, Python decided to punish all infidels. So, where there used to be a friendly relationship between strings in different encodings, today, Python wages war. For pedagogic effect, Python punishes everyone who may be so bold as to use an array of bytes, where it believes a string is appropriate. Even though, there are no practical reasons to do so. So, for example, should you want to send a string through a TCP socket, Python will no longer convert it into an array of bytes for you. Only through suffering, you can reach catharsis: you will have to convert those strings yourself. Every time. Until you accept Unicode as your personal savior, I guess.
They are a few hundred lines. They really pretty small.
Thanks, I will scope it out.
Was doing this during my final year too. You'd benefit a whole lot from trying to remember this stuff. I happened to do a dissertation on Python using dark matter data sets and had to learn a whole lot myself just by trying to accomplish the project tasks! It's really nice to manually apply logic to a data set and have it return meaningful values. DataCamp is the resource I used to learn. You can learn Numpy, Functions, Dictionaries etc before you touch Pandas so you only need to access the free content from DataCamps Python course. Either way there are plenty of other resources out there - for the love of god: Stick to one course, no jumping around. &amp;#x200B; Ill try to update with my Git when I add my old project to it. Dark Matter is weird yo &lt;.&gt;

Thank you very much for your comment, greatly appreciated. &gt;You won't be able to apply this out of a Masters Program, cause you are a "Master's Student" and this task is left to the PhD grads that Many Asset Management firm hire straight out of school who are good at it plus have production quality coding practices. This makes a lot of sense. It makes sense that a company would want the absolute best to write their code. Especially in a trading environment (or whether the company focuses on arbitrage opportunities) you want the best on the job market. &gt;\[...\] You might get a good chance at banks and trading firms where I am pretty sure, all the models have been already implemented and you'll be doing maintenance on them. This is what I expected but it is great to hear it confirmed. This helps me (including the above) to think differently about the algorithms and that it is not so much about the writing of the code but more about understanding the method used. I will be putting my focus on going through the different ML algorithms and understanding them properly, work on my production quality coding skills as well as contact people from the industry. Thank you once again!
That's how I got my start. In grad school, everyone in my research group was analyzing the output data files by hand. I thought, "this is stupid and boring," and coded a better way. 
If you do not know what a CLI is, I cannot help you. I suggest Google.
1: this belongs in /r/learnpython 2: I just happened to be doing some research into this earlier. Check [Parsing In Python: Tools And Libraries](https://tomassetti.me/parsing-in-python/), check out [Parsy](https://parsy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) , and watch [Parsing Horrible Things with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUdeLIj4hE)
Some ideas in here maybe http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/
Could you just deploy it in docker so that way it runs on linux?
Its kind of specific to the needs of what field tbh. I did mine on dark matter and it ended up using numpy and matplotlib to plot data sets and get the relevant values. By relevant values I mean the equations that dictate dark matter behaviour.
This is best unicode rant ever! Applies to a few other languages too (I'm looking at you Delphi). 
virtualenv ... google that and my favorite, virtualenvwrapper ....
Then it doesn’t matter what you do from a performance point of view. Just explore the APIs and have fun. 
That said, is there a good pythonic way to convert between strings and byte arrays? I've been using something like this: ^(for a\_char in a\_string:) ^(a\_byte\_array.append(ord(a\_char))) In this case I know that a\_string contains ASCII characters. &amp;#x200B;
Calling mystr.encode("utf-8") is not a religious experience. Hell, you can put the encoding in the open call, so it’s even easier. 
Yes, I'm already using pipenv. It doesn't solve the problem. I still have to have pip installed on the system, for example, in order to install pipenv. I'm not installing pip to $HOME/.local/bin. I don't know how it keeps getting installed there.
Love to read stories like that. Kudos to you!
Email your professor. Subject: Dropping your class Body: I am a cheater and don’t deserve to take your class. Sorry to waste your time. I’ll drop it immediately. 
The difference between a fast SSD and an old HDD is ~5s to ~25s for 2 GiB, so this is very likely CPU bound to reach 90s... Nevertheless, Python is the perfect glue code, to call more specialized tools, **if necessary**. [Here](https://tech.blue-yonder.com/oxidizing-python-speeding-up-urlquoting-by-using-rust/) is an example, where a simple Rust wrapper speeds up the process by a factor of 10. Python is **good enough** in the vast majority of the use-cases and as /u/FlagrantPickle said: &gt; What's "good" for anyone here doesn't matter. Is 90s acceptable for you? The golden rule is to not over-engineer but first **identify** the real bottle-necks and while your statement &gt; Most of the time, external factors determine the speed is 100% correct, I *assume* OP's problem is CPU bound.
System pip is not installed in user home directory. Reinstalling it is not the solution. Something called by the user does that. Some installer or updater script possibly. You can prevent user pip from running by removing `.local/bin` from user's $PATH. That way only system pip will be executed, unless full path is used.
I would have AirFlow tasks / jobs that require to read and write to windows directories ie inputs might be csv files and outputs csv files to and from windows directories. &amp;#x200B; If I deployed it on docker, would I still be able to write to windows directories and read from windows directories on specifc tasks and jobs?
Nice! It's surprising how useful Python is. It's my go to for lots of projects.
That's a question for your workplace's compliance team. Different companies have different rules for things.
Here is what i found: https://developers.google.com/custom-search/docs/overview Or you can try another reverse image search service.
It's all open-source, so there's likely no legal violation. However, there could be a security violation depending on your workplace.
Haha yeah I saw them all
https://learnpythonthehardway.org and give yourself a project. I learned python by writing a porn scraper. 
Please tell me more about this scrapper. For research purposes of course 👀
If your primary interest is learning, I'd highly recommend getting a copy of "Effective Python", and applying each concept to your code as you see it would be a good fit. The book is divided into little applicable sections, and, aside from the things it actually teaches, it teaches the nature of Python and the mindset needed to write Pythonic code by example really efficiently.
I could post it later tonight/tomorrow, It has the bot token + database credentials hard coded in so I cannot share the direct source, I would have to modify it a bit
Why would you be in fear for your job after pip installing a few modules? 
There's `bytes.decode` and `str.encode` for converting between them.
Maybe if your company is a military contractor, but even then you’ll probably just get a stern talking to.
I don't have it anymore, but I used it to download galleries from image fap as they were uploaded until it filled a harddrive then I deleted them all and ran it again a few more times and used that drive to learn about data forensics / recovery. As far as how it worked, I analyzed the url composition of the actual images, and had my python program dynamically construct them based on the gallery ID and user ID it could get from the front page. 
Learning how to use the pyautogui model to automate mouse and keyboard functions. I stumbled upon it while searching how to automate renaming files, and in the book '[automatetheboringstuff.com](https://automatetheboringstuff.com)', there is a very easy-to-read tutorial. It's very eye-opening! I could potentially save hours of time if I learned and used this right. Let's see how it goes!
Does it have GIL? &gt;As of now the standard library is under construction. Why can't just use official stdlib? Yes, some part is written in C for optimization but they usually also have pure python version too.
Huh. Did you use a specialized software for the recovery or randomly started searching memory blocks near the associated directory?
r/learnpython
Yup
Lucky you. I sometimes use ssh, docker and vim to spin up a remote IDE, since its hard to install something at work.
Man you are an inspiration! I am also a MechE learning python. I want to put something together to help me do my timesheets in python, similarly through CSV files. Congrats man!!
No. A class decorator works like a function decorator. It’s just syntactic sugar for class A: ... A = decorator(A) A metaclass, on the other hand, is the class of a class object. That is, you can run `type(1)` and you’ll get int but if you run `type(int)` you’ll get the metaclass of int. Changing metaclasses gets you into the Python magic internals for things, and it becomes super complicated quite quickly. It’s basically always a bad idea. 
Dumb Chem E here, it is so incredible how Python/pandas (amongst other imported modules) have revolutionized data analysis. I actually ENJOY analyzing data and get it to presentable form. Excel has its place, but I'll try to use the Python/pandas pair anytime I can. Good going, my fellow engineer!!
read the sidebar /r/learnpython read THAT sidebar
Could you load the data in and out via S3 instead?
Function decorator is a callable that takes a function and returns another function. The `__new__` of a metaclass takes a class and returns another class. So it is equivalent to a decorator. 
Hand into a glove you say? https://i.imgflip.com/107gtb.jpg
Awesome suggestion. I will check it out!
Thank you! And nope, I use anaconda interpreter and pycharm. I just can’t get into Jupyter for some reason. 
Dude, really give it a chance. You'll thank me, believe it!
... I know what a command line interface is. I just don't know whether you're talking about the REPL or about invoking python from a terminal, both of which are command line interfaces to CPython. Why are you being so hostile?
I built an exe that outputs csvs and there were security concerns because modules are open source. 
Yes. Check out /r/learnpython and [Automate the Boring Stuff](http://automatetheboringstuff.com/).
I’ve seen automate the boring stuff, I haven’t purchased it yet, also thank you for the learn python subreddit link!
You don't need to purchase it - the book is free online, and is great reading all by itself, even without the videos.
No shit. Here I was wanting to buy the $20 one on Amazon 
Hmm what? Pyenv isn't a replacement to virtualenv. Those tools serve entirely different purposes. Pyenv is Python version manager - a way to work with multiple versions of Python on the same machine. Virtualenv is a tool for environment isolation - a way to isolate the dependencies of a specific project from those of other projects. 
I tested out a few different tool. At the time, I was thinking about going into cyber security or pentesting. 
If anybody would be willing to look at my new post, I’m needing some assistance with Python. My homework is do 3 hours from now. I just need guidance and would be willing to pay. I appreciate any feedback. 
Both Abaqus and Creo Simulate for simpler analyses
Fuck yeah, congrats :)
Well duh
You are my inspiration!! Aiming to gain that level of proficiency in python one day
I’m glad to hear it! Don’t wait for the proficiency, just code things! You’ll learn as you go. I wouldn’t call my skill sets anywhere close to proficient with python 😉

[Bext](https://pypi.org/project/Bext/), a module for adding curses-like terminal control to Python, but unlike curses is cross-platform and works on Windows. You can move the cursor around the terminal screen and print in color. It's built on top of Colorama, and nifty for creating text-based games. `pip install bext` The basic functions are: `goto(x, y)` to move the cursor, `size()` to get the width and height of the terminal window, `clear()` to clear the screen, and `fg(color)` and `bg(color)` to change the foreground and background text color. Colors are strings: red, blue, black, etc. GitHub is here: https://github.com/asweigart/bext I have a bunch of text-based games in this repo: https://github.com/asweigart/pythonstdiogames
Thanks! I will try this and report if I can reproduce the results. 
I’m working on my first ANN. It will (hopefully) be able to read handwritten digits.
That’s awesome bro. Can I ask what courses you took on edX and did you find them worth it and beneficial?
Of course. I took the Georgetown intro to python class, and the MIT 6.001x intro to python (twice). The MIT python class is the most enrolled class on all of edX, and it is FANTASTIC. I can’t overstate how much I learned from those courses. I highly recommend them. 
I said virtualenv not pipenv. 
I can't tell if it's my system or not but I seem to have all sorts or weird display artifacts when using tqdm. It's one of those low priority - still mostly works bugs though.

I transitioned from chemical engineering to a software consultant through the Python/Pandas. It's been an amazing journey for me. Keep at it bro/sis! Learn how to package and distribute your code and people around the office will start using it. CLI is your friend. Python-fire is definitely worth checking out. Dash is useful for visualization of your dataframes. Oh, and Jupyter Notebook is obligatory if you haven't encountered it yet! Most importantly, don't forget to share your knowledge with anyone willing to learn from you. This is the true purpose.
Thanks for the feedback and suggestions! Totally agree on paying it forward. I love mentoring and sharing knowledge. Good luck to you!
You need a colon (:) after the else
Dealing with large sql tables and sqlalchemy can be a real pain if inserts are needed, im a survivor of the sqlalchemy pyodbc engine 🤦‍♂️
Ask your teacher's assistant, collaborate with your classmates. Don't ask the internet to do your homework for you.
Thank you!
Edit: Now I'm getting an invalid syntax on the else:break. What do?
Thanks for the link! I'll definitely look into that. 
Thanks but read write access to the windows directories is a mandatory requirement otherwise it is 6+ months of migration work
Set yourself a goal and start learning towards it. I started with building web crawlers for my job. To automate the boring stuff. ;-) From there on I moved on to counting fumes in maps and writing results to Excel files. All I need is a goal and I start writing and learning the things I haven't done yet. Currently in trying learning about oauth2 so I can start using a certain API.
Ive been studying Pierian Data's Python course on Udemy. Thanks for the new resources ! 
I second this suggestion - the book is fantastic!
Weird, I haven't had any issues with it. I mean, if it messes with the appearance it's kinda useless since it's supposed to make things look good haha. Might be the terminal updating just a bit to slow making it look weird?
I wasn't exactly asking the internet to do it for me. If you read the post, I tried whatever I could think of and I was looking for some guidance. Maybe wording could have been different.
Jython is quite active [https://bugs.jython.org/](https://bugs.jython.org/) (you can also get it from git). There is a version 2.7.2a or something. But the development is indeed slow since the python 2.7.X language specification is very mature, so developers are slow to implement small missing features. Perhaps this is why the development of Jython 3.0 is slow since the demand is low (I'm still using Python 2.7, and I'm very happy with it). But Java always evolves so you can call fast changing Java from super stable slowly-evolving jython.
Cool.
Congratulations!!! I am self taught as well, and started using python and C# in my work as an Electrical Service Engineer last year. It feels good to create with python 😀
His replies in other conversations suggest that he's not the most rational sort.
Do you need it to be a csv for any particular reason? Pandas can "pickle" dataframes which sounds more like what you are after!
Yeah, I've not dealt with that myself, just mysql and mongodb. I don't know how well sqlite scales, I just know that it's only trustable in a single-user/access mode, and it's part of the core python, so figured it might help. I could see it just being a better method to select data (with SQL) sets.
You might want to take a look at Dask as well. The syntax is very similar to Pandas' but the execution time is much, much faster.
this guy pickles... df.to_csv() will lose your datatype info, df.to_pickle() should do the trick
[TinEye has a published library](https://github.com/TinEye/pytineye)
I don't know this kind of tools, but a jupyter notebook pair with jupyter hub could be a way to do it also. 
Ah nice one, I'll give it a try!
I mean this really sums it up: &gt; An object is hashable if [1] it has a hash value which **never changes during its lifetime** (it needs a `__hash__()` method), and can be compared to other objects (it needs an `__eq__()` method). [2] Hashable objects which compare equal must have the same hash value. Because `hash(x)` should always return the same value for the same `x`, and `x == y` should imply `hash(x) == hash(y)`, that means for all hashable types, equivalence classes should be immutable, by which I mean that if `x == y` holds now, it should hold always. That means, if you want to mutate `x`, you should not be able to mutate anything that affects the calculation of `__eq__`. The two groups of hashable types that the post outlines (the ones that work like `tuple` and the ones that work like `object`) are both subsets of a more general sort of hashable type, let's call it a half-mutable type: https://gist.github.com/gvx/679597e0fce2c5f274c00f837c2db117 (this is just a proof of concept, but it seems to work fine!)
Thank you! I haven’t heard of it, and I’ll look it up.

It might not have been your intention to ask that, but speaking as someone who has helped a lot of classmates with their programming homework: we can't really help you over a reddit thread with an exercise like this. It could work if we met face-to-face, looking at the same computer screen. But now, the only thing we can do is write your answer for you, which doesn't help you actually learn anything and could get you into serious academic troubles if you're found out.
r/learnpython is best for this. I'll see you there. x

I haven't run Airflow on Windows, but standard Python programs running under the Ubuntu shell on Windows can read/write standard windows directories/files. They appear under the /mnt/&lt;drive&gt; directory, for example to open C:\\mydir\\myfile.csv, my Python program would open /mnt/c/mydir/myfile.csv. This mapping is part of the Ubuntu shell implementation rather than anything specific to Python.
I've been using this approach for many years. Works well. I've also tried the separate shell script as a controller, it works fine but requires a mental context switch if you do anything non-trivial in the script. It's less stress to stick with Python for this.
That's exactly where I started! 
Are you looking for experienced?
What kind of project? Open source?
This doesn't sound like something you attempted to Google first.
Congratulations? I'd say condolences!

From a design perspective, it makes sense as you can leave out all the white space.
Technically you can use semicolons with Python too.
That’s more like C#, with the `PascalCase` going on.
You are right. I think TypeScript because I a saw a window.form.label
I imagine that being said like Borat
