Assumptions always fuck you over.
This is less for long-term log collecting and more for inserting during debugging and removing afterward.
I have too agree with others, this question is way too general to answer properly. Personally I’d look for at least some formal education, projects that you have done and can explain in detail, and be displaying a real interest in computer science. Oh you best not be a one language wonder, yes there are Python “jobs” but there are many more jobs that require various skills beyond Python. As for regular expressions I would never bring them up in an interview or even have them used in submitted sample code. You can discover after hiring if there use is acceptable but many places would consider regular expressions bad voodoo. One problem I see in many of these “can I get a job programming with Python” is the impression that is left that the individual isn’t really committed to the industry and is just interested in that quick fix. I fully understand the need to get a job to get out of a bad situation you will want to present an image of someone that wants to invest himself in the field. This is the case for any job really, it might be called enthusiasm by some. Like many occupations programming is a life long learning event, you must demonstrate that you are up to that reality. 
Off topic but why 8 nucleic acids? codons are 3 base pairs
Many languages have recursion limits in place, Java being one of them. You can usually increase them or lift them entirely
I just finished a code exam with an employer, as someone said, what you need to know is specific to what job you are applying for. WebDev? Well, probably front end languages, flask/django, and some sort of database. data analysis? Then jupyter notebooks, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, excel/csv files The one I applied for was cyber security based work with detecting personal information in documents. So I had to learn how to open various files, extract the text, identify the personal information, put it into a dataframe using pandas, clean and organise it, export it out as CSV file. I learned how to handle varous file types and learned which libraries do what, but or importantly I think the main point was to see HOW I coded, So I showed I can write reuseable functions, iterate over lists, list comprehension, understanding how the data flowed from one stage to the next.
Civil Enginner. I'm making a web app with Flask for online structural calculations.
Those 4 letters are DNA. Since DNA can be many millions of symbols long and we don't know exactly what OP is doing, we need to be careful before using recursion.
- Single-threaded async code (so 99% of asyncio-based code) where breakpoints stop every task - Any kind of long-running connection with a heartbeat - Any other situation where you're interacting with the outside world and your peer expects a timely response
Read all text split and count length of array. Then u can count special cases like,comma,separaded,words,with,no,space. https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/dictionary/python-split
So you never really pass by reference in python, but by object, right? The only reason it appears like you pass by reference for more complex objects like class/dicts/arrs/tups is because these are collection of objects, so their "sub-references" could be updated without interfiering with the direct reference? 
I have just started learning the basics of python, you know the stuff you learn when you start learning any new programming language, conditionals and loops and syntax stuff. I do however want to ultimately learn how to create software with graphic user interfaces using python and I have no idea how to organize my learning process. can someone please give me even a basic road map from zero to being able to build your own software using python
Is there another way without using libraries, dictionaries?
Kaldi is a fantastic tool. It's just meant for people who know what they're doing.
I hate to say it, but this is an example of simple and verbose being more clear than the clever way. Sure the nested loops are tough to maintain, but I would leave them that way until there was a good reason to change them to itertools. A first year comp sci student could figure out what the posted code does, the itertools version, not so much.
This right here is how any good developer should hire another developer. I have a degree in physics and minor in computer science but work as a software engineer. I’d say I get by day to day relying most heavily on the problem solving I learned from physics and not any language specifics I learned in comp sci. Having said that, I like other devs to have at least been exposed to things so that they can look in the right direction for answers when they’re stuck. I don’t know everything but I sure know how to google most things.
As mentioned, the trick isn't memorising everything and knowing how to write it all from scratch. It's learning the logical process of what you want to do. You need to learn to break down your project into steps. example. Create a script that converts user input from lowercase to uppercase. Write out how you think it should go. \# I need to get user input \# I need to store it \# I need to manipulate it \# I need to return it &amp;#x200B; Once you have your sequence or work flow, start filling it in, and if you don't knwo how to do it, GOOGLE! "How to get user input python" [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3345202/getting-user-input](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3345202/getting-user-input) "How to store a string pyton" [http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2140372](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2140372) "Convert string to lowercase python" [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6797984/how-to-lowercase-a-string-in-python](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6797984/how-to-lowercase-a-string-in-python) "Display text in terminal python" [https://www.w3schools.com/python/python\_strings.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp) &amp;#x200B; \# I need to get user input and store it user\_input = input('enter a string') \# I need to manipulate it user\_input.lower() \# I need to return it print(user\_input.lower()) &amp;#x200B; After awhile you will start to remember basic methods and and algorithms. And you'll start to learn how to elaborate on them and writer cleaner code. Just keep writing and keep building. Once you've made something, write it again, find better ways of doing things, ask lots of questions, ask people to critique your code.
You don't need map. Just use round instead of square brackets. 
Here’s a short script that shows it in action - hope this helps. import pandas as df # create a simple dataframe df = pd.Dataframe({‘a’: [1,2,3], ‘b’:[4,5,6]}) # look at the column names print(df) # define a function we will pass # our dataframe to that will # change the dataframe some way def change_df_col_names(my_df): my_df.columns = [‘c’, ‘d’] return # now pass the original dataframe # into the function change_df_col_names(df) # look at the column names for the # original object # note that we did not assign the # return value of the function to # the original variable name, # so it is the same reference as # before we called the function print(df) 
For passing arguments into functions it's basically like always passing by reference. It's better to think of all Python objects as mutable or immutable. And the variable is just a label to that specific object that the interpreter has in it's list of all known objects. Mutable objects get created in some initial state e.g. a list &gt;&gt; a = [1,2,3] &gt;&gt; id(a) 18753823 but changing the object's state is possible (like a class' member variables) e.g. &gt;&gt; a[1] = 7 &gt;&gt; id(a) 18753823 Immutable objects like integers, strings, and tuples cannot be changed after they get created. For simple types this corresponds to a new object with a new value getting created automatically e.g. &gt;&gt; b = 1 &gt;&gt; id(b) 18753823 &gt;&gt; c = b &gt;&gt; b = 2 &gt;&gt; id(b) 14745383 &gt;&gt; print(c) 1 &gt;&gt; id(c) 18753823 Note that 'c' still corresponds to the original Python object but 'b' got assigned a new one. If you tried to change which object is held at a specific index of a tuple you would get an error thrown because the tuple is immutable. But you could have a tuple containing mutable objects like lists and then change the *elements of those lists*. That's where things get a bit confusing.
Always start small and try to build up your project by functions. If you want to do web scraping for instance: 1) write a function that takes an url in parameter that only prints the parameter. run the function from your main code 2) now improve your function with the "requests" lib for instance to get the content of the web page and return it. print it in your main code 3) write a function that take that content in parameter and do something with it. use the beautifulsoup lib for instance. from the function, get a specfic data from the content, return it and print it in your main code 4) improve your first function to manage authentication 5) etc etc you get the point &amp;#x200B; btw you can take a look at test driven development. It somehow let you build applications step by step by adding parts of code that let you pass predefined tests
Well you might be dumb but let’s say that isn’t the case. First; this getting started problem isn’t unique to programming. So realistically you are not alone here and you shouldn’t feel that it is a problem with programming. Second; you will do far better writing code for something you know well. If the code needs to implement some mathematical expression I will create a comment block with that expression spelled out in the best ASCII possible. Further notes and even reference links will be in that comment block. I use to do this on paper but loose paper is easy to mis place. The alternative to loose paper is a lab notebook which can be very valuable with some projects. In any event the idea here is to understand what the code needs to do before you write anything. Third; think about one gear at a time. You need to have some idea as to how all the gears fit together but work on one component at a time. That may mean input processing, then data setup, followed by data processing and etc. Fourth; if you are working with hardware read the manuals, not just the programmers reference manual. This relates to previous comments about understanding the problem before you even start to code. At first you want to read such manuals in depth but later on you can develope the ability to skim through the unimportant parts. 
Shout out to hacks4pancakes lol. Question though, why does he show up relatively close to the 2nd in the bar graph on the right, yet he's got a way bigger chunk of the pie chart?
I hate that you said that too. This is not an example of that. This is an example of not thinking clearly about the problem you’re trying to solve and using a poor tool for the job. No one should ever leave the code in the state of the OP. 
Aren't these only permutation of a 8 character word consisting "a,c,t,g"??
The half is actually "other" I think. Bottom of color legend.
&gt; there was a good reason to change them to itertools You gave a reason. They are bad to maintain. Also, it looks fucking ugly. When I opened this post, I expected a 2 or 3 deep nested loop, not this monstrosity. I screamed silently for 3 seconds and put down the phone and walked away for a while. Meanwhile the itertools Alternative may not be very obvious but it's better to see, and one can easily look up what it does. In a rare case Op wants to change the no of strings in output. He would have to keep adding or removing loops. With itertools it's one number, and it could even be determined programmatically
Split is in core. It not need dependencys or imports. Why you want to avoid split? There are ways, but u need to write a feature like split. 
This should serve as evidence for why nobody should use pie charts. The histogram is so much more useful.
Your describing natural language processing and doing it for every message and trying to come up with intelligent answers is basically the same complexity as programming Google assistant/cortana/Siri. For your use case I would suggest making a bit that responds to specific commands like &gt;user: !hoursleft &gt;Bot: there are 3 hours left Way easier. 
But the histogram is severely truncated. If you look [at the full histogram](https://github.com/Kamik423/twap/blob/master/twap_bar.pdf) on [the GitHub](https://github.com/Kamik423/twap) you can see that it goes on for ages, far too big to post to a reddit post that anyone is interested in.
Your import line should read : import pandas as pd
I wrote a Python tool, [which is hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/Kamik423/twap) that uses the Twitter API via the Python Module „tweepy“ and plots the percentage any user I follow contributes to my timeline. It uses the Python Module „matplotlib“ to creates the graphs. The source code, full images and a longer explanation is [on the GitHub](https://github.com/Kamik423/twap).
Yup - good spot - was typing into a tiny box on the mobile app, thanks.
&gt;Our first homework assignment are 4 simple computing programs, designed to see if we should or shouldn’t be able to make it through this course. I think you got your answer.
nice, cool project :)
Thanks! Yes, making the sliders visible by default is pretty much certain, whatever we decide on. We might even get rid of the mix of standard paid plans entirely, and just have "free" vs "paid", where paid defaults to the current settings of the Hacker plan (which is the most popular) and then people can adjust the sliders to see what different upgrades would cost.
Take a look at this module: [https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html) All you have to do is to create a dict, for example methods = {"+": operator.add}, and call it: methods\[method\](float(add1), float(add2)). In Python, functions are first class citizens, which allows you to treat them just like any other object.

Vertically. There are 960 more people below. They make up the huge other part in the pie chart. 
The pie chart also appears to reuse colors multiple times. Not very useful as a visualization. 
Continuing work with /u/pythonHelperBot. Trying to make it adjust it's comment about code formatting when it notices users are posting code using the new reddit editor. Hopefully that'll also help the reformat code command have awareness of whether or not it has a shot at reformatting code. Work wise I'm just processing logs and building reports on a program from last fall to explain what it did at every step, why, and what literature backs up that decision. It should be a nice and boring week
Ah, I see. You should still consider accepting log scale into your life, regardless of this chart.
Optionally you could toke a look at the 'eval' function, but that would require the whole operation as one string.
We should all accept the log scale, especially considering the human logarithmic perception
That’s not the actual point of the post bro. These first 4 things are basic. I just haven’t programmed in a long time and have never used python. I know how to figure out how to make these programs work but I’m having issues that are essentially python3.7 being something I’m not used to using. So syntax, etc. is screwing me over 
Lol... Jetbrains has nothing to do with this. It's a feature of debugger, not the editor. Besides, you cannot break on all threads. That is simply theoretically impossible. 
Yeah, you said you haven't programmed in 9 years. I doubt you have basic knowledge, and think if you take a class that applies programming you should know your way around your language without help or you are bound not to pass, simple. You can't write a French poem if you've conversed in French once, at a bakery to get a croissant on vacation. But whatever. How about next time you ask for help you a) post to the right subreddit, which is /r/learnpython b) don't make screenshots of code but post actual plain text (formatted correctly, ie monospaced) including the error message c) don't post screenshots where you have to turn your head 90°, put minimum effort in what you post.

Python's infrastructure sucks... that's no big news. Why does it suck... well, I guess, historically, Python started as a not-for-real language. It had no goals of becoming a system programming language, with all the typical utilities you'd expect from a tool for developing distributable applications. Some of that was added on top of it over the years, but it came in a form of patches, and crutches, and now it's a layered "pie" of historical misunderstandings and quick patches that seem like will never die.
You could also just not be a dick. It doesn’t cost anything

I wrote something like that, [Judgish](https://github.com/kstrauser/judgish), which uses NLTK sentiment analysis to tell me which people I follow are both prolific and downers. I got tired of being flooded with negativity so I automated a way out of it.
Are there other good languages for scripting that I can easily make an deploy on Windows? C# for example is rather easy to deploy but it's limited since it's not open source and if you use compiled .dll it's impossible to use one file... 
Thanks! Definitely works. I created a PR called \`rfind\` on the repo and put your name up there. Cheers
Thanks!
pdb is great when you want to dig down into a codebase but feels a little heavy when you are writing small scripts or just want to see what an expression is equal to quickly. This isn't intended to replace a debugger, but rather just be a quick utility to enhance the typical "print"
I didn't say you should tell whom explicitly, it's enough that you say "anyone". You are still doing it explicitly. `go` in Go doesn't yield control. In fact, when you run `go func()` you are still pretty much not yielding control to anyone. Control will be transferred to another coroutine instantly, if there are free threads in a thread pool, or it will wait for free threads. But you *don't yield control* at the point you call `go func()`. If you think so, you don't understand how Go works. Yielding control in Go achieved on compiler level: this is how it does multiplexing of goroutines on native threads: it splits your code into chunks, which it can then schedule on those real threads. You can think about it as if the compiler was inserting invisible "yield" commands after every few statements in your code.
Cool! I will take a look. Thanks
This is right
Thanks!

Thank you! I even test it trying to import the function from other module/file and same result. 
"Help me desperately to pass a class I'm not in the last qualified to attend cause I'm entitled to pass it" 
What about logging?
Actually, the class isn’t about programming, just has a programming component. Secondly, people who feel entitled don’t ask for help to put in the work. STFU
"I'm entitled to passing, so entitled in fact that I can't even put in the required amount of effort in my post or post it in a place it belongs. I'm so important that whoever reads this must help me. I'm in no way arrogant, no sir" 
Get a note book and write the problem on top, then ask your self what steps do I need to do to solve it? Write them down, for each step above repeat the process until you can write code. If you are younger then me use outlining software. Then make your outline code and test 
It's also more rigid and requires far more maintenance. If, for example, you decided you needed 16 nucleotide chunks you'd need to add another 8 blocks of nested loops to OPs code. With itertools you set some variable and change 'repeat=8' to 'repeat=chunksize'.
I’m sorry for whatever I’m your life is causing you such pain that you feel the need to lash out. Do you need a friend? I’ll be your friend. Seriously. 
I don't tend to befriend arrogant, whiny and entitled people sorry. 
If you need a friend I’m here for you. I hope you get help. 
LO G S C A L E?
If you do say so yourself?
The point is they've added the glue to make it seamless so you don't need 100% of things you're using to be async. If there's a couple of blocking things you still have to deal with along with your other async stuff, there's glue code in asyncio to easily interact in an async way to an executor or a subprocess directly.
Im not talking about the editor. im talking about the debugger that ships with the IDEs and i literally set breakpoints on multiple threads several times a week, so im not sure what you're talking about
it sounds like it might be better described as a logging utility than a debugger
I think I must be doing some weird operations then. Sometimes I receive that warning saying I am trying to set values on a copy of the dataframe. Why does that happen then?
Pie chart REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Don't hold your breath. I was in the alpha testing for the redesign. I'm still blown away at how much feedback they ignored every single day. All of the complaints I see about the redesign on release were brought up many many months prior.
When you move the code to pycharm is it still on the notebook? It is possible your notebook is just not very powerful, is it? Also is there any multithreading/multiprocessing? If not, and even in most cases if so, you shouldn't see all the cores run at 100%, there should only be one thread running the interpreter. Are you sure you're using the same interpreter/installation? This strikes me as strange, if all of this is happening on the same notebook, something is broken on your python installation. Have you tried running this in a virtual environment? That should probably solve the problem if the issue isn't hardware related. Pycharm does this by default when you create a new project in it, and you'll have to select the interpreter and make sure all your imports are installed. Or if you want, use "venv" to spin up a virtual environment for your code. Just google python3 venv and follow the steps if you aren't familiar with this, it is pretty easy.
When you say space, do you mean hard drive space or RAM? Or, I suppose, CPU or whatever.
Follow Trump and AOC? OP doesn't value his sanity
Probably the easiest way to do it is to go to settings-&gt;add or remove programs and features then search for python. If it doesn't show up there it's probably baked into another program which there's a long list of.
Different people learn in different ways. Maybe you just pick things up by working on existing stuff and maintaining it. You could try forking some project just for your own use and refactoring it as a learning exercise. Also, one thing I do when building something from scratch is to break down what I want to do into functional steps, then build each part. I write the steps in a text file for my own notes, I sit there and think about it for a minute, and then I dive right in and start coding. Maybe I get it wrong at first or build it initially in a not so optimal way, so I fix it afterwards. That's just how you learn, you've gotta just be confident and write something that does something. If you don't know where to start, start anywhere. You'll learn from experience what approaches will make your life harder or easier.
thanks for your input. The way I set it up is that I have my own library code written in pycharm and imported into the notebook. To debug the performance issue, I literallity copied the line from notebook to pycharm. Since all the dependencies are there, it runs with no problem. &amp;#x200B; That being said, my pycharm and notebook are using the same interpreter, under the same environment. &amp;#x200B; I suspect the multiple core usage is due to dask (a distributed version of pandasdataframe), but have no way of confirming it. &amp;#x200B; I wish there is a way to debug in notebook, then I would at least be able to pause and see which line is taking most of time. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Normally, Python does not use a lot of memory - it runs very well on the first version of Raspberry Pi which has 256MB of memory shared between CPU and GPU. I doubt it that Python itself is the cause of his issues.

Python 3.7 by itself doesn't do anything. It can run programs written in Python, just like Java runtime can run programs written in Java language and .NET Framework can run programs written in C#. For example, I know some computer games that are running on Python. So firstly, I'd take a look at the task manager again and check what's the exact command that's running - you may find that Python is just running a script written by &lt;some company&gt; that's part of &lt;some application or game&gt; - that would then be a true culprit, not Python itself.
Under cpu in task manager it says it's using 50%
Yea that makes a lot of sense actually. I'ma check it out when I get home
Im actually the opposite, give me a problem and I can solve it with some time and effort. Let me look at someone elses code and I have no idea usually where the problem lies. I think it might be the way you are learning. Are you watching and reading or are you actually doing and creating. I do and create while watching and reading.
Presumably it's a 2-core PC, as well?
This is meant to be used in a different context than logging. This app isn't meant to run in production as a replacement for a logger but rather as a replacement for multiple `print("var\_name =", var\_name)` statements during development
its this, unless he runs his own python programs it cant be anything else. Python is likely a child process of some other app, and its embedded into it.
You can get thousands of FPS with hardware acceleration? Are you some kind of wizard? 😀 More seriously, do you have any techniques to share? 
How would I go about finding it? I assume I need to remove the parent program.
Well, if you remove python, the parent program will stop working. So if the parent program was important, you'll find out quickly enough. IIRC the dropbox client uses python, that would be my first guess
Awesome! Here's an idea -- combine this with a twitter fake audience analysis to see what percentage of their follower bases are bots and fake accounts.
Python 2...
To expand: First: Definitely post this stuff to /r/learnpython in the future Second: The square brackets create a list. [This should explain what a list is](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_lists.htm). As such a list will never be the same as 0.
Thank you all for the cool tips and tricks..
I recently completed implementing a full backend with Flask, and I can confirm it is very easy to use. Honestly, probably easier than any other backend REST-ful architecture I've implemented. But then again, I am much better at Python than anything else. 
If you look at the complete graphic on the GitHub you see that it is not viable to put the entire bar chart on reddit.
I like to stay informed 😉 
This is very cool
I think he was referring to your original post, where it sounds like you are asking if Python can do anything JavaScript can do *and* asking if Python can do anything Java can do. The answer is that Python can do what Java can do in terms of backend (and is easier to implement IMO), but as far as frontend goes, JavaScript and jquery are really your only options. Honestly, hating on JavaScript is a bit of a meme at this point. Sure, it has weird quirks, but those really only surface if you're doing stupid stuff like comparing objects of different type. Sit down and try to write some JavaScript to do a few simple things on your front end, and I guarantee you'll find it much easier than you originally thought. JavaScript was *made* for that stuff. 
Data visualization isn't always cookie cutter and simple. Find a way
We are in the same boat, but as far as I read a good start point is the "how to automate boring stuff with python" incredible book. 
Is it possible, we see some code?
First, on asking your question in r/learnpython subredit. Second, take a book "automating the boring stuff" is great for that. If you have something you want to do, you should ask for help and start your idea. 
i do multiple things... what i normally do to actually learn: watch a video or reading ( at that time python is still closed) when i am done reading or watching, i try to recreate what i just learned.. saw... This did help me to understand code better ( not just copy paste code but really try to do it from scratch) sometimes i do return to the video or reading if i get stuck and sometimes it's just out-dated stuff.. so i go out to find if the library or module got another name in Python 3.. which usually is the case than i just fix that, so my code may differ from what i just watched or read.. but that's just updated for the newer version of python.. this is usually not a problem at all.. if i look at someone else his code.. the majority of code it just some how connects and i can read what it does.. even if someone made his own functions and stuff which ofcourse takes me a bit longer but still i understand and i can adjust or improve the code.. ( a programmer that i know told me that, if you become a programmer your usually working in someone else code.. and there might be some code you don't understand) so in that case i should be good XD... but when i do think of something i write it out.. usually i make a .py file commend everything i think i need.. but then i donno, i think it's what the other guy said about the writers block.. ( ofcourse i might forget things i maybe should need.. but i can always improve that after but it just the beginning of it...) &amp;#x200B; for example codeacedemy was where i first started.. what i do like about that is that they don't give you the answer ( yes you can google it but that defeats the purpose of learning) but if they ask for something.. i just feel like i don't really understand what they are asking or want from me.. maybe it's a language issue i mean i can speak and get a bit technical in English ... but i don't understand everything so i something find myself googling what it means in my language so that i can have a bit better of a understanding... &amp;#x200B; thing is that i feel really dumb starting from scratch, but if i work in someone else his/her code i usually get told, it was smart to fix it that way or they didn't even think about it doing it that way.. &amp;#x200B; maybe i am just over complicating things for myself but yeah that's how it is.. and i'm trying to fix that :) &amp;#x200B; srry for the long reply :P &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Any idea how this reflects natural cycles of say lions vs zebras?
Did you use a differential equation to model population changes? How did you incorporate movement about the island? Does the terrain influence anything?
Unless I were hiring for a position that needed to be very productive ASAP, and as an independent contributor or as part of a very small team, I'm not too concerned about specific knowledge. As others have said, I would be far more focused on whether or not you have mastered "algorithmic thinking". That said, I transitioned from an entry-level job where I was almost exclusively modifying simple HTML to a job in process improvement, where I mostly created and updated reports in Excel. Over time I made that a Python job by writing a reporting platform on the side and getting approval from my management to roll it out internally. The first time I was on the job market looking for a "job as a Python programmer" was May 2013. I have a couple of repos on GitHub still from that time, that I remember showing my future employer during the interview as examples of my knowledge. They are: * https://github.com/lyndsysimon/statscharts * https://github.com/lyndsysimon/python-prospects Neither of these are or were "the best I can do", but they did demonstrate that I can solve a problem using Python, that I knew how to write tests, that I had a decent coding style, that I knew how to use git, and that I at least understood the basics of how to create a Python package for re-use.
Try running the code by doing this on the notebook : ```python -m cProfile -s cumtime file.py``` That will invoke python's builtin cprofiler and tell you what is taking up the most time 
I think people should answer for others less. The dude was just being a dick.
There are a few [word lists on github](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words). If you're teaching stuff as low-level as "how to randomly sample a list", downloading that manually is going to be much easier than having to actually scrape sites, but you also have the option of using urllib/requests to get it from raw.github.com very simply. From there, it's as simple as `import random; random.sample(word_list, 10)`

Thank you for your response, GitHub is a good idea. I try to keep it simple but at the same time do it right. What I mean is I know there is no need to really be completely random and could chase the is this random enough down a long rabbit hole. BUT I am the example they are learning from so I try to do things correctly. The advance students will look at the functions I write.
Ahh, this brings back the memories. **Sim Life** : _The family that transmogrifies together eats flies together._ https://www.amigareviews.leveluphost.com/simlife.htm
Is it definitely that line? Could you print something immediately before and after to check? I often find that when I run Python programs outside of PyCharm it takes a while to load (or whatever) before the actual Python program is even started.
I did make a mistake in the testing script...See correction in the original post. It is a very involved one-liner that is taking all the time. 
Hey, thanks for your advice Josh, I'll take a look!
It's a quite simplified simulation, so no differential equation(a lot of parameters though). The population changes after the amount of herbivores there exist in the given coordinate and after the fitness of the herbivore/carnivore which is based on age and weight. The fitness decides if the herbivore/carnivore can give birth. The movement is random. The probability to move right, left, up, and down is the same. The terrain are jungle(dark green), savannah(light green), desert(yellow), ocean(blue) and mountain(gray). Jungle and savannah has food for the herbivores, more in the jungle than savannah. You can't walk in the ocean or mountain. 
I completely agree with the vast majority of this comment, first of all. My response here is intended to show the differences in how I evaluate a candidate, not to say that anything about it is "wrong". &gt; First of all, you need to know the syntax of Python well. You should know how to use all the useful constructs Python (as a language) provides, when to use them and most importantly: when NOT to make use of them. This is really key IMO. One thing in particular here that I'd look for is whether you know what methods and constructs iterate over an iterable and which ones defer iteration until later - i.e., you know what produces a generator and what doesn't. I also want to make sure you know _why_ a method returning a generator is desirable and when it's not. I generally wouldn't ask those questions directly, though. I'd give small code examples and ask you to take a look and offer suggestions for improvement. For example: the following example takes twenty minutes to run; what would you do to begin speeding it up? ``` from my_app.models import User from my_app.utils import users_are_related from my_app.utils import process_user def process_related_users(user): users = [process_user(u) for u in User.query.all()] return [u for u in users if users_are_related(user, u)] if __name__ == '__main__': for user in process_related_users(User.get(1)): if user.name == 'Lyndsy Simon': print(user.__dict__) break ``` The solution I'm looking for here would be something like: * "Processing all of the users before filtering them is inefficient, switch the order of the statements" * "Because we're stopping iteration of the loop once we find the user we're looking for, we don't need to process all of the users. Use generator comprehensions instead of list comprehensions so the only the users encountered before the one we're looking for get processed" Obviously, this is a contrived example I wrote for this post. If this were a real interview, I'd spend a bit more time polishing it; better yet, I'd pull a real example out of live code, perhaps modifying it to contain a similar defect if necessary. &gt; Secondly, builtins and the standard library. Builtins should be easy to learn (there's a limited number of them). Make sure that you know how and when to use a dict, set, list or tuple. That's a good entry point for solving real problems. Standard library is a much more broader topic to study and you should pick the packages that you find useful. The most general ones will probably be itertools, functools, concurrent.futures, abc, subprocess and collections. This list is NOT exhaustive and the order is random. Builtins, absolutely. They're the core of the language and you have to fully understand them in order to write idiomatic code. The standard library, though? There's a _lot_ of stuff in the standard library that's completely irrelevant. In Python 2.x, there's a whole set of packages there for dealing with SGI IRIX! I'd ask you what out of the standard library has made your life easier in the past. That's kinda open-ended (and some people struggle with that), so I might go on to ask you to implement a simple decorator. I might ask you if you know what "currying" is. I might ask if you've ever used the `collections` package, or `functools`. These questions would be designed not to test you specific knowledge, but to try and uncover your past experience solving complex problems. It should be clear that I don't expect everyone to know all of this stuff, too. Some of it (like the word "currying") is something of a shibboleth; self-taught developers will often know the ins and outs of `functools` and partial application without ever encountering the word "currying" in a Python context. That's OK. If neither of us are able to come up with examples of tools you've used in the past, I'd introduce you to a couple - probably `collections.Counter` and `functools.partial`. If you'd not encountered those in the past but got excited about their utility, that's just as good a sign to me as it would have been if you'd been familiar with them. &gt; Next thing is the ability to create pythonic (idiomatic) code. This ability is what tells apart a professional Python programmer from a programmer who simply knows Python. You can start learning by reading PEP8, but this is yet another broad topic. This is more important to me that anything else listed here other than "algorithmic thinking". I don't care if your personal coding style matches mine, but it very much matters that you care about readability and that your preferred style is something that you've explicitly considered. You should have opinions about docstrings, inline comments, and when (or if!) they're advantageous. &gt; And the last thing: third party libraries. What you should learn depends on the projects you want to be working on, but some people would probably mention Django or Flask (for web development) or scikit-learn, NumPy and Pandas (for data science stuff). Yep - this is part of "have you ever written something that works?" to me. It's difficult to write anything that solves a real problem without encountering some third party library. &gt; As a programmer, you should also concentrate on improving your problem solving skills. To me, the ability to analyze, break down, and solve problems is what defines a "programmer". What defines a _good_ programmer is a bit different. You should be able to *explain* complex topics to someone else in a way that they'll understand. You should be able to speak at multiple levels of abstraction depending on your audience (explaining a bug to a fellow developer, a manager, and a colleague in sales all require different language). Depending on where you are in your career, you should be either an effective mentor or willing to be mentored. Most of all, you should be willing and eager to learn whatever you need to learn to solve problems in your job. This is often misconstrued in my opinion - I don't care what you do outside of work, and I certainly don't care if you're not interested in hacking on side projects and going to conferences and such on your own time. What I *am* interested in is whether you're willing and able to pick up a new tools, learn it, and use it with confidence.
&gt; defective on Windows or Mac Never heard this, can you elaborate?
Very cool! In grad school I implemented something similar from the [Lotka-Volterra equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations). It's a good exercise.
Oh, I see. Color blindness strikes again.

&gt; To me, being a dev is not 9-5, those are just the hours you are paid for. I completely disagree here. Living and breathing "tech" can be a good sign, but it can also be a red flag. Especially for someone more established in their career^†, I don't expect them to be spending their time outside of work learning tech. If they are, it's something of a red flag - I'd want to know they're actually independently interested in the topic and don't feel pressure from their employer to spend that time; otherwise, it's a big indicator of impending burnout in my experience. I'm 34, and I've been a full-time dev for just over fifteen years. Outside of work, I hack on side projects sometimes, but I also have other hobbies: guns, photography, playing ukulele, amateur machining, gaming, etc. If I gave all of that up I could get a lot done on side projects, but I don't think I'd be substantially more effective professionally. I already have a good idea of what's out there and how they compare; I don't need to be able to sit down and write a SPA in React from memory to know what the benefits and drawbacks of doing so would be. &gt; So have your random projects up on your github/gitlab or whatever up there with all your terrible ideas that never panned out. Agreed. Almost all of my public git repos are unfinished, and as far as I know that's never been a negative. I leave them up, and talk about them in interviews. "[This is a library](https://github.com/lyndsysimon/statscharts) I wrote when I was at FedEx, writing a reporting platform. I found myself implementing the same kinds of charts over and over, and began working on making it a generic library. I moved on to a different role before it was mature and haven't gotten back to it. It's not representative of my current knowledge, but it's a good snapshot into how my mind works and the process I go through when trying to limit duplication of effort." "[This is a library](https://github.com/lyndsysimon/cryptocoin) I wrote when investigating the technical underpinning of Bitcoin and its derivatives. I learned a lot, but eventually discovered that there wasn't a need for a library at that level of abstraction, so I abandoned it." You get the idea. If nothing else, it gives you something to speak confidently about in an interview. It's a lot better to be in control of the situation and explaining something that you've worked on than to be answering trivia! :) &gt; Being able to drop tidbits of you heard this idea from source X but haven't been able to use it or you are still struggling to understand its full implications will be a good differentiator of you and the rest of the field during interviews. Actually, I think it's quite a bit more than that. I keep up with HN and occasionally pop over here to Reddit when I'm spinning my wheels on something. As a result, I often encounter problems where I have a "tickle in the back of my head" of something that might be relevant to solving it. This has saved my employers substantial money in the past. For instance - at a past employer, we wanted alerting and monitoring for a healthcare app. Most of us had used Sentry in the past, but at the time it wasn't HIPAA-compliant when used a service. My manager was in the process of speccing out the requirements for building, deploying, and supporting Sentry internally when he happened to mention it in a standup. I vaguely remembered a discussion on Reddit about a year previously where someone had contacted Sentry and they'd said that they were working on a HIPAA-compliant product, but weren't sure yet if it was going to be a dedicated hosted product or an appliance. I started digging through their blog and FAQs, and guess what? They'd rolled out a HIPAA-compliant hosted solution a few months prior, and no one at our company knew. Instead of hosting our own and using internal resources to support it as a service, we got to just pay a monthly fee and not worry about it. That single anecdote almost certainly saved our devops team more time than I 'wasted' the entire year reading HN, Reddit, and chatting on IRC. ^†: To be clear, this is not a statement directly related to age. If someone has been in this field for a year or two, I'm not surprised to hear that they're spending all their time building their skills. It's still new to them and there are lots of things to learn. If someone has been doing it for a decade, I expect that they'd have time in their lives to pursue something motivated primary by personal fulfillment. If that's tech, great. I've more commonly seen that people feel they have to keep up with everything they can to stay relevant though, and that's not great.

I agree, but I fear you're painting with a bit too broad a brush. I know some devs that are absolute monsters when it comes to productivity, inside and outside of work. For example, I worked with [Steve Loria](https://github.com/sloria) at the [Center for Open Science](https://cos.io). That guy is the very definition of a "10x" developer as best I can tell. While working under pressure for a major release with all kinds of issues at work, he developed and released [marshmallow](https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow) and [konch](https://github.com/sloria/konch). I could never have done that. At the same time, he's one of the most outgoing and personable devs I've worked with.

I've been working on pyframe all day finally succeeded with travis-ci code analysis after 16 failed statuses. [pyframe](https://github.com/framestd/pyframe)
Can you share the models you've been using though?
I'm a research scientist developing infrared sensor technology. I use python for all of my modeling and computation. I also built a suite of test software that automates several different characterization measurements. Coupled with that is a database GUI that allows my team to look at the data as a variety of plots and compare samples sizes temperatures etc. This provides us with feedback to better plan future experiments and detector development efforts. I'm working on a similar setup for array testing (imaging). It basically replaces Excel, labview, origin and matlab for me.
start the book the others suggest, 'automate the boring stuff', find the writer's video lectures that go with it and try to do yourself ALL the exercises. use reddit and stackoverflow to ask questions. that's what i've been doing for the past 1-2 months and works like a charm. it's gonna be tough but hang on, it's a great first step.
Plt.tight_layout() plz
Well yes, pyQuery does exist, but you won't be able to have a browser interpret it for you. Browsers simply aren't made to interpret Python. The creator of pyQuery even stated that he made it because he wanted to mimics the jQuery API. On https://pythonhosted.org/pyquery/ it states: &gt;This is not (or at least not yet) a library to produce or interact with javascript code. As I and others have said, Python is great for backend, but anything that the browser renders is going to use JavaScript. There's really no getting around it, unless you want to attempt to write a JS library that can interpret Python code and covert it to JavaScript.

Check out those emergent Lotka–Volterra curves. Fantastic!
Does Python have tail-call optimization? e.g., could you turn that conditional into a guard... ```python # ... if x &lt;= 0: return x return f(x) ``` ...instead, to side-step the recursion limit?
Ah, that's too bad. I'd love to see how does it work

You're better off using `time.sleep` for this kind of thing for a whole passel of reasons: 1. Your suggested solution will produce wildly different wait times on different hardware, so it isn't portable. 2. `time.sleep` uses the system's APIs for sleeping and resuming the current thread, which is more accurate and more respectful of other running programs. What's your real goal here?
I get 1000+ in Minecraft a lot. That's a 3D game, so 1000 is a bit low for a 2D game. That's mostly because it's only using 30% of my GPU's processing power though (Minecraft uses 100% on unlimited FPS). As for getting good FPS out of Pygame, my first recommendation is to work at a low-ish resolution (like 400x250 in the case of Super Potato Bruh) and scale it up to whatever you want. On the optimization side of things, I recommend only rendering what's on screen and using a tile system that minimizes the processing power needed to figure out what tiles should be on screen. Typically I'll split the tiles into chunks of tiles (similar to Minecraft) and load chunks depending on where the player is in the world (usually I keep the chunk size to about 20%-30% of the display size). I recommend using dictionaries for this. Also, if necessary, I recommend optimizing the physics to only load up objects around the entity being handled instead of testing all objects for collisions.
How do you do this? Take various pictures from the plots and make a video or you did that with PyPlot?

I'd suggest looking into source code of Kali Linux tools, many of which are in Python. 
Raspberry pi, can be an option
[Here it is in real life. Isle Royale National Park] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_Royale_National_Park?wprov=sfla1) Wolves and moose exist in isolation on this island and have been studied for years because of this. The cycle goes through a boom and bust though and doesn't reach stability like your model. 
If you are just building an mvp (minimum viable product) now, go for single DB with each tenant getting a table. If this is going directly to production with intent to scale, go with option 3. However as you point out option 3 is simply put much more work for db admin, security and API considerations **and** it will definitely cost more. This is essentially why scaling has been difficult for most startups (and even larger companies). Lastly, if you do go with option 3, use a 1:1 master/slave ratio in the beginning to save yourself time and money. If you find you need to scale up, DB design will become more important when you are trying to squeeze out every ounce of performance using different read/write configs, etc. You should definitely either learn more about db administration or get someone who can help in that regard if going with option 3.
Lol thanks buddy. I know its going to be hopeless at first but practice is the key.
I wouldn’t suggest that, since he needs to learn the fundamental first. Also, some codes contain shellcode, how would he even read and understand those?
Seems like option 3 is herculean task for me. I'll need to understand it better to even consider using it. I guess I'll stick with option 1/2 for now. I have a question. Say my application is deployed on a AWS instance and I have a single db with a schema serving one business customer. Now, another customer visits my portal and purchases the service. Assuming , he makes the payment via my portal , is there a way to set up the system immediately for him by automating the second schema creation ? What I mean is. Say there exists schema_tenant1 with 5 base tables. This schema exists in database which is serving tenant 1 for now. I have a service buying facility on my website wherein after paying a certain amount, the customer gains access to his system. Now, when he gain access to his system , I want the system to automatically generate another schema card schema_tenant2 with its 5 base tables but serving tenant 2 only. So how do I make this schema creation logic ? Should I just accept the payment , then manually create schema and activate the base tables, lush the changes to the server and then give access to the client or this process can be automated ??
Definitely a choice. Even raspberry pi zero w will work well.

The Cybrary course is great definitely give that a watch, also you should checkout the book "Python for Unix and Linux Systems Administration". ITs an O'Reilly book which is excellent learning for navigating the filesystem, accessing resources and more using python (which is a big part of what security is). Lastly checkout Peter Kim's Hacker Playbook 1 &amp; 2. It provides a ton of insight into techniques and more importantly the mind of a hacker.

There are simple models that can be created to simulate herbivore-carnivore interaction but it is just that. It all boils down to the details. How this applies to lions and zebras or cats and farm mice all depends on the details
That usually happens when you try to set values inside the dataframe itself through the df[something]=stuff notation on just some rows/columns. Usual way to avoid that is to re-write it to use df.loc[something] (if accessing things based on some conditional or a label) or df.iloc[something] (if access by row numbers) instead. That warning is a pandas specific one due to the way certain internal operations are planned/optimized - the loc or iloc version is the preferred way.
ChromeOS now has the linux subsystem and python is already installed (I have a chromebook as well ;)). Maybe you need to upgrade ChromeOS version? Also you can just create a free tier aws account, spin up an ec2 instance for free and there is your cheap computer for python.
Where did the carnivores come from? Did they just spring into live? It seems that they came from nothing.

Pythons main OS is definitely not windows (if that book insists it is I would be suspect of its contents) - it's definitely more common for it to be utilized on Linux/OSX/*BSD machines.
nice job
Exam on monday, so I'm "trying" to focus on that. I will probably work on this after that too because it needs improvment, f.ex. the file above has a horrible layout and the simulation takes forever to run. Once I'm finished I'll share it:)
All [dateutil](https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), its 'relativedelta' is powerful. 
Fair point. I guess my question is more along the lines of how this simulation performs compared with whatever you're trying to simulate. Or at least some model in which to understand the population plots. For example, are the periodicities expected to behave as they do? Please take these questions as expressions of interest. I really like the concise way these results are visualized!

Refining an automated hold timer for use in gymnastics training (my real job), using opencv. It takes a video feed, and when it detects no movement, it starts a timer. It can be set to play an audio cue when a pre-set goal is reached. Great for training kids to hold their handstands and other strength positions, and it gamifies the training process by giving them instant feedback. (also I'm job-searching, so if anybody knows anybody that's looking for programmers with an interest in video processing applications....)

Thank you /u/lgiordani, started reading the book after you posted it, about halfway through - great book so far. Question regarding the to/from\_dict methods (part 2, chapter 2) - isn't the vars function more 'pythonic' for getting a dict from a class instance - and dict unpacking for instantiating a class from dict? Any reason you use to/from\_dict?

Matplotlib’s FuncAnimation class has a save function for creating videos. If you create the animation with the simpler pause and update plot method you can save each frame before moving onto the next one then use ffmpeg or similar to convert the frames into a video. 
You can save each frame individually then convert them to a video with ffmpeg with a given frame rate.

I've done a lot of controls tunning. So a little oscillation around some number is reasonably stable. Like if you had a temperature control on a reactor. You might see a steady oscillation of 1 or two degrees but you'd consider that "Controlled". The Isle Royale population has swung dramatically. Recently the wolf population crashed and had to be supplemented. My brain looks at that and says, "This system cannot produce a steady state." I'd find his model interesting if it could predict something like Isle Royale. It's likely that the carrying capacity is too small for the population. The wolves need to large a breeding population to keep healthy, so they crashed. Just my theory though.

You don’t need to use the desktop environment to use a Pi. Installing the light version of rasbian and setting up ssh would allow you to use it as a “server” and run python programs on it with no problems. Setting up a share so you can edit files on the main computer and executing them on the Pi should be no issue. I have not used Chromebook, so I don’t know if it can mount a share over ssh/sftp or if you need to setup something like a samba share.

Thanks you for this. I am going to try using both, Selenium and the normal request and fetching it from the json file.
Thanks, bud! Just to confirm, this is using selenium right?
No it's not. You can model population dynamics like this with differential equations, or model them as an agent based system. It's not the same thing at all. 
In my experience customers care that you are careful stewards of data but few have actual policies around how data can be stored relative to competitors. The client you build this for is so big that it will be a no-brainer. If you’re not sure, my advice is don’t build something you might/might not need. 
Ya that makes sense. Thanks.

thank you and sorry for posting it here, didn't thought about that
This is extremely rare except in cases of very sensitive data or very large organizations. At the end of the day it’s up to the engineers. If you have tenant data segregated into separate physical hardware but it’s all accessed by the same code and the code has security problems it’s just as vulnerable. Focus heavily on your code being secure, the database layer is much easier to secure.

Thanks, I'll take a look.
That is a surprisingly good tutorial for matplotlib. I really liked the part where the difference between the object-oriented and Matlab-like syntax is explained. Many more examples of plots can be found in this linked blog post: [https://www.zdf.de/politik/maybrit-illner/familienbande-kriminelle-clans-ausser-kontrolle-sendung-vom-24-januar-2019-100.html](https://www.zdf.de/politik/maybrit-illner/familienbande-kriminelle-clans-ausser-kontrolle-sendung-vom-24-januar-2019-100.html)
Does it have a random name or just gibberish? Might be a temp file

Thank you for linking that project. I haven't heard of that before. I'm working on something similar, but with the option to switch between rectangular and hexagonal grids. It's very interesting to compare with mesa's implementation and learn from what they did differently!

KYSKYSSLIT YOUR THROATS CHOP UR HEAD
Yes. But it's a framework so it wont work out of the box like Home or Alexa.
Fuckk, why didn't I know this last semester.
yes
The frustration of the Setup will make you quit programming trust me i have experience that thing is only good to run maybe like browsing 1 tab or runing some api server etc
Also, be aware that HTTPS is a required protocol for HTML5.
It bugs me (probably more that it should) that if you actually wanted to import this module to make use of this function you have to deal with the side-effect of opening a web browser. I mean, yeah, it's an easter egg, but if I ever actually wanted to use xkcd's geohashing algorithm, some stupid part of me would be tempted to temporarily disable the `webbrowser` library to avoid committing the sin of re-implementing a standard library function.
I don't know if I understand what you want to build exactly, is it an in-terminal game, or a game that happens to be text-based? I think that apps that run in a terminal, in Windows might be a pita. What I'd suggest, other than [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/news), which already has some [ncurses bindings](https://inventwithpython.com/pygcurse/) is to take a look at [Arcade](http://arcade.academy/sample_games.html). If it's the former, and you absolutely *must* run in a terminal, I've heard of people using or [npyscreen])(https://npyscreen.readthedocs.io/introduction.html) or [urwid](https://github.com/urwid/urwid/wiki/Application-list) with varying degrees of success.

This is exactly where you should use a tree map
That's not a histogram, it's a bar chart. A histogram has ordered numeric values on both axes. 
Calm down? There was nothing emotional there, just getting to the point, although perhaps a bit too blunt for some people.
&gt; range(0, 4^length -1) you sure the -1 is needed? range(0, 4) gives 0, 1, 2, 3
Don't expect anything, if you are expecting a reward and not get it you'll only feel like it has all been for nothing. From previous experiences I have programmed many valuable things for my ex-employer that was never asked, and never got something in return (apart from a tap on the shoulder). See it as time spent well on yourself and expanding your knowledge!
This isn’t always the case though. When I first showed a boss I could code I got a substantial raise
You could try sell it to him at a fixed price. Calculate how much money your employer would save annually using your scripts and multiply it by 10. Include documentation with the scripts so your employer would be confident that someone else can easily understand and update them when you're gone
Yeah a github link is way better than a screenshot of the program in action which doesn't say much. If you want help with something though, you should be a bit more specific. People generally wont want to put in the work of going through all of your code not even knowing what you would like to improve etc. So first of all, you need to narrow your request down a bit. Do you want to add functionality and want help on how to do it? What kind of functionality? Do you want ideas on what functionality to add? Do you want to improve existing functionality? Do you see what I mean, if you don't specify what your goals are, there is too much to assume on the side of the reader. This is just my advice on how to make these types of threads better. Secondly, I took a look at your code and it looks like it's pretty much copy paste from codecademy, you can literally take entire functions, put them into google search and get other github links with the same code down to the letter. That's fine though, starting out with already working code and getting to know it is a great way to learn, but again, what's your goal? What are you trying to accomplish? Answer those questions for yourself, then try to put it in practice, and then will come more defined opportunities to ask for help as you get stuck on the way.
I think that heavily depends on your employer though
Be careful. I did something similar once and 3 people lost their job and I gained nothing.
I did a couple of things that were not dissimilar at my first job at a Fortune 500 manufacturing company. They did recognize that I saved them dozens of man hours per week with something that was not in my job description, and they promoted me which came with a raise. It looked pretty good on my resume too, since the writing was kind of on the wall with that company/that industry. 
Here you go: import webbrowser class NopeBrowser(webbrowser.BaseBrowser): def open(self, *args, **kwargs): return True webbrowser.register('Nope', NopeBrowser, preferred=True) import antigravity 
Clearly you don’t have experience with the light install if you say it is ‘only good to run maybe like browsing 1 tab’... it does not have a desktop or browser at all. But yeah, if he has never used the command line, or Linux, it could be a bit difficult.
It is absolutely impossible to set breakpoints on multiple threads because the order of execution is not deterministic. It is only possible if you know the future with absolute certainty. You would have to guess where thread A would be at the time thread B reaches its breakpoint. I don't know what you are doing several times a week, but unless you have some superhuman powers, you are just really confused about what you are doing.
I had very similar problems with Ruby. And I even saw someone attempt this with PHP. JavaScript might be a little easier though. Node seems to be mostly trying to cater to Windows-based developers...
Show off your ability to tell stories with data. For example, the kind of stuff in the book Dataclysm.
When you install on MS Windows, not all systems can even install Docker: you need special virtualization libraries which are not available in "Home" type of systems. On Mac, you need to install a VM player first, i.e. VirtualBox, I guess, and run Docker inside of a VM, which defeats the purpose of having Docker in the first place, since it would be easier to just run a proper VM. That said, all things you would want from a Docker container, like binding ports, local directories etc. become a pain because you also need to deal with the VM in which Docker lives.
lol, breakpoints don't predict the future. they halt execution when code is executed. when you set a breakpoint, it is set on each thread. it's not rocket surgrey. but i assume you're doing to double down on being dumb, so here: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Debugging_Multithreaded_Applications.html https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/206938025-Breakpoint-Question-on-a-multi-threaded-program https://help.eclipse.org/luna/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.ptp.doc.user%2Fhtml%2F06parDebugging.html https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/debug-multithreaded-applications-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2017 
Nice work ! Project is clean README.md + asciinema + well documented cli, yet I think you could do a better work for the synopsis, as "Opacify reads a file and builds a manifest of external sources to rebuild said file." is not clear (for me at least). It reads as the external sources were pre-existing, with something along "Opacify reads a file and split its content into several external sources to rebuild said file later", I would have grasp the concept quicker. Not convinced by the choice of `pacify/satisfy` wording for the CLI mode either.
Sounds pretty creepy and invasive to me. &amp;#x200B; Let's say someone is interested in Python, but also active in other private interests (e.g unpopular politics or support group for X) -- tools like yours make it easy for people to judge and slander them.

Instead of carnivore-herbivore, could this be called predator-prey modeling?
Great! You can fire 2 people :)
This is not true, I have docker installed on my Mac without VirtualBox or qemu. No problem, whatever.
&gt;Thanks for the complete answer, appreciate it.
Show us your code and the **complete** traceback, formatted as code for reddit. And you should ask on /r/learnpython.
My suggestion is to look at `tempfile` module. We often encounter scenarios in our app where creation / writing to temporary files is essential. This module eases that work. Module reference: &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html&gt; Example usage: (taken from official doc) ```python &gt;&gt;&gt; import tempfile # create a temporary file and write some data to it &gt;&gt;&gt; fp = tempfile.TemporaryFile() &gt;&gt;&gt; fp.write(b'Hello world!') # read data from file &gt;&gt;&gt; fp.seek(0) &gt;&gt;&gt; fp.read() b'Hello world!' # close the file, it will be removed &gt;&gt;&gt; fp.close() # create a temporary file using a context manager &gt;&gt;&gt; with tempfile.TemporaryFile() as fp: ... fp.write(b'Hello world!') ... fp.seek(0) ... fp.read() b'Hello world!' &gt;&gt;&gt; # file is now closed and removed # create a temporary directory using the context manager &gt;&gt;&gt; with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdirname: ... print('created temporary directory', tmpdirname) &gt;&gt;&gt; # directory and contents have been removed ```

Visualisation stuff. Show that you can convey ideas through figures. I love [sankey visualizations](https://github.com/ricklupton/floweaver) for this. E.g. "Where does the money go ?" You can do this with your own budget or even fake a company gross revenue and show which (fake) products sell most. They won't care about your programming abilities, but if you are able transform data into actions/recommendations.
wow that is actually really dope!
Sentiment? Whats that... You did some bad translations when writing this post
This is the solution I'm going for. Thanks!
Is it single threaded implementation or there are multiple threads working ?
I think it depends also on: Are you supposed to program in your position? If not and you know, might get the raise. If you are supposed to program and you just did that extra thing, it might end up as @tetek123 says.
If you weren't asked to do this and this work wasn't sanctioned, this is going to blow up in your face. I hate the idea that one would work against efficiency, in my mind efficiency is sacrosanct. But people don't understand, and when your boss' eyes are red because his boss keeps talking about expenses, the first thing he's gonna see when you show this to him is that he doesn't need to pay you anymore. Sad but true. If you were asked to do this or discussed it previously and your boss said he'd pay you if you could do it, stay at that company forever. They know value when they see it. Otherwise, swallow the knot in your throat and pretend this never happened.
Very similar situation. I ended up writing a whole proposal that would have saved the business countless hours and made them untold cash. So they moved that team to Poland and now I work somewhere else! I recommend keeping it quiet and passing the work off as your own. With all your extra time you can improve your skills and find a better job! 
Point, I never remember if range is inclusive or exclusive. 
1) Take responsibility for making everyones reports/graphs. 2) Work from home 3) Do whatever you want and get paid for it. But honestly, /u/monzzter221 has the right idea.
Thanks dude
Not sure I understand your point. How would you expect it to be modeled?
Look at his prior posts. It's clear he made no attempts to gain a better understanding over the time he was in the course. He dug his own grave and now needs to live with it.
Write a tool that builds a pretty visualization graph of some medium size set of data that can be found online and is up to date. Even if it is simple, being able to take a bunch of letters and turn it into a pretty picture that makes the data more useful to a human is impressive to just about anyone.
Well that’s true. I was totally in a non-programming role back when that started
&gt;RemindMe! 5 days &amp;#x200B;
Something else to mention. Chances are you've made a mistake in your code, or have missed a special case (as everyone doors writing code). Can you run it discretely for your own work for a few weeks to check it and polish it? Then you can worry about whether others will lose their job etc. Is there anyway to code it such that it requires you to be on the payroll for it it run smoothly? Hr database lookup? 
This reminds me of a very old DOS game called Unnatural Selection.
There are [formulas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations) that create the up and down shape shown in the graph. You could plug those in and just jump straight to the result. No need to actually model predators and prey interacting, just the result. And my comment was that it would be more satisfying to model the actual predators and prey and see what happens to their populations over time. To simulate real interaction. See the same graph that you get from the direct mathematical models emerge out of the simulation, than just to plug the formula into a graphing calculator. 
This. I automated myself out of a job once and should've sent my time learning new things while sitting around getting paid. I quit due to boredom and later regretted it.
&gt; can I expect to be compensated for this/promoted? Prolly not, see other comments. Other people might lose jobs, you can keep yours though, that will be your reward.
Noting is always the case, its never that simple. To define here we would need to know: 1. What you were making 2. What the raise was 3. What is the definition of coding here The big possibility here is that you got thrown a pittance for skills that should be paid far higher, or your skills are not that amazing but did deserve a kick. 
This might be the best way to go about it, you made it on your own time so it is your IP.
Hey even i am learning python and want to proceed in cybersecurity I think it may be a good if we do together 
I really like your project, it's right up my alley, but you have to fix the spacing between your plots! Overlapping text is not okay. 
I see it as 2 choices as I’ve written a few similar time saving programs as well: 1) offer it for free and hope that they recognize your initiative and abilities and maybe some day you can look forward to a promotion, 2) use the program to save yourself time and use that time to better yourself and your career (or play an mmo on your phone on the can)
Here's my take on any paid course(s): They do make learning a lot easier for beginners by compiling all the important work and do make it easier for new learners. But, if I was given a choice to take 2 years figuring out python myself for security or taking a 6months paid course, I would choose he 2 years even if I were rich because: - Nowadays there are better github tutorials, youtube videos and blog posts that compile the same level (and in some cases more) information. - Learning slowly makes the learner remember things better because obviously they spend more time looking and seeing the same thing. It may seem boring, but after 2y or so, they would be glad they spent so much time. - Courses that straight away poop out 5,6,7 or whatever number of example programs are shit imho.. because when I learn to make a network ping utility for example, I better be taught most stuff about how the whole network architecture works, not just in python but in every aspect. My point being in short: Spend more time in fiddling with Python than looking for any course for faster learning.. This world didnt put so much blogs, repositories and information just for you to go and sit on an instructors lap again (like you do in schools). Learn freely and take your time. Take looong time &amp; become better than anyone taking a course. Youtube, Github, Blogs, Websites are more than enough. 
Thank you for the reply! Does this mean I should just delete this post? I’m not next to my laptop right now, but I’ll send it over in a bit! 
I mean this was about a decade ago and was the doorway I used into coding. At the time: 1. I was barely paid above minimum wage - $8 in my state at the time, which was the hardest hit by the recession 2. It was $4/hr, or about 50% of my then rate 3. My skills were nowhere near amazing (I had literally taught myself at night over 3 months), but could manage some simple automation (I made a tool that let a repetitive task done by coworkers be done in seconds)
Most of the posts in this thread are overtly negative and honestly give pretty terrible advice. "You weren't asked to do it so pretend it never happend"... yeah, that's pretty ridiculous. Most bosses aren't these villainous characters in the movies. Chances are your bosses are going to be grateful for your efforts. There's definitely a chance you could get compensated but you're not going to get a portion of the hourly savings in perpetuity. Think about it as a business owner. Is it reasonable to pay someone $900 /week (60 hours x $15) or am I going to pay for hours spent upfront plus an ongoing maintenance fee. This is a the reality of being a programmer. If your script handles most of the operations of the company then you should start your own business in competition with your employer. Only then will you be making saving the $900 /week in perpetuity and increasing your bottom line.
No it doesn’t have gibberish. It has a clearly and purposefully written name. It’s not my code, I’ve just been working on disassembling it. But traceback/ and disassembled says I’m reading a function from another file. The thing is I know this file can’t possible be written in the directory it says it’s in, which is the root directory. So my theory is that when I execute the script a temporary file is made in the same directory yet giving the illusion that it’s somewhere else by giving it a file name that looks like a directory. 
Tell him that you have an idea to save a little bit of time and suggest that you can automate a smaller piece of the work that you do. See how he responds to that. 
Root directory of the machine you mean? maybe it just looks like that because it's relative to your source file? Best bet is posting code and traceback
You are sacrificing your job security for what gain? nothing.
Uh, no, you just don’t know a term here. Sentiment analysis is analyzing the emotions present in a given chunk of text - like is the text passage expressing a positive or negative emotion
This entire thread is like a dystopian nightmare. Instead of doing the right thing, OP shouldn't because capitalism says if you're not the one capitalizing you're gonna get fucked, because greed wins over all. How sad. 
What are you talking about? OP said this code removes 60-80 man hours a week. That's literally 2 jobs. It's not hard pressed to say bosses love firing people if they don't have a use for them.
I hope you cleared the SQL query with other people and have a test database to run against. Querying is not free. If you're querying large amounts of data you can impact a database. 
I once edited a massive spreadsheet using Python. A task that was supposed to take 30 mins to 1 hour was done in about 5 minutes (including research on implementation). I also find webscraping with Python super simple. I downloaded lots of dog pictures using Python. In a nutshell, Python is really useful in automating everyday tasks.
https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html
So in your opinion his job is at risk? Why would an employer fire the person who built and will likely maintain the script that saves them so much time? It sounds like you think that the possibility of a coworker losing their job is a good enough reason to NOT try to improve processes. Assuming the company has competitors if they're not trying to operate as efficient as possible the company won't succeed anyway - aka many more people losing their jobs.
Hmm, I haven't heard of a library that would generate random words. I can be wrong. Probably the simplest way would be to have a separate file (csv, txt?) that contains the word list and just grab random words from there.
This is an awesome explanation. Thank you!
More likely other employee's jobs are at risk. 
What framework are they using? I’d set one up at home and play around with it.
As I said, I know I should use time.sleep. It was more about theory crafting the worst usage of resources in a few characters :)
now that’s fricking awesome, good luck with it all!
Data science in python is very easy compared to other languages. I also prefer flask over bootspring. There are many things easier but it comes at the cost iof performance usually 
Fella I worked with did something just like this, I helped out a little too. It would automate closing out bullshit alerts that were never real and took 10 seconds to go in and close. We ran it on our own for 6 months before he mentioned to our boss about it (I'd left at this point). No issues were ever raised, but he was told to shut it down just in case it didn't work right and closed off something that was real. Knowing the code this wasn't a possibility, it was looking for very specific strings that only ever came in through these fake tickets. It saved the guys in my job hours every night and meant we could work on real cases instead of closing bullshit, but still it was killed. My advice, run it on your own, make sure it works right every time, and then keep it quiet. There are 3 things that can happen: * Your boss loves it, realizes the 60 hours a week it saves is at least 1 full time employee, and lets go one of your colleagues * Your boss hates it and shuts it down * Your boss loves it and gives you a pat on the back, maybe a small raise or a bonus, you and everyone in your team is expected to do more other work since this has been automated.
Those differential equations don’t have a closed-form solution, so you can’t simply plug in the initial conditions and jump straight to the end result; you’ll actually need to model the changes in predator and prey population over time. Conceptually there’s no difference between modeling predator-prey interaction and solving a differential equation that models predator-prey interaction, as the first case reduces to the latter.
You can. And many a college student has. Myself included. But don't take me word for it - try it yourself. https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/PredatorPreyEquations/
Welcome to America
That demo is a neat UI for inputting the parameters of the differential equations, but it’s still solving the DEs numerically. The Lotka–Volterra equations don’t have a closed-form solution.
Someone did something very similar at my work. He started out just using the tool himself, then shared it with a few people with some technical skills. Approached a manager to be allowed to work on further developing the tool. Got a yes, he then built a GUI in a month and it became the standard tool for that task. He has since then used that accomplishment (along with others) to negotiate a raise and a promotion. But from others: I suppose it depends on the company. I guess you are the best judge of that: what does your company value? How have they reacted in other cases? 
That's the price of progress, I guess. Sucks for everyone who lost their job but if their job can be automated then it must have been pretty menial. Hopefully they landed on their feet and were able to find something more fulfilling.
I'm not sure where everyone else works, but I would not recommend laying low and keeping it to yourself. Any good company will value impact and a commitment to self improvement; even if it's not this job, future jobs will love this story. Most scenarios where coding skills are valued are *not* high tech writing spaceship algorithms, it's examples like this of making people's lives easier and allowing for time to be invested in customers, not creating graphs. 1. Test. Test. Test. Nothing could be worse than confidently claiming you've automated 1 hour of everyone's day only to cost them time because your code has bugs. 2. Start small. What portions of this process are you responsible for? Automate those and begin to evangelize and offer to help others do the same. 3. Share with your boss that you've been investing in yourself and learning to code to *free up your time to focus on more important tasks*. If their reaction is encouragement than let them know you've also been helping others. 4. As things expand (with your known and capable goal of full automation) collect feedback from people you've helped and document the impact of saving time. This will be crucial during performance reviews as you have a great story: self improvement and investment in your own growth, and making the business more effective. Again, take this incrementally and have the focus being freeing up time to focus on what *really* matters to the business. If your current boss and company end up being asses about it, well at least you have a great story for your next round of interviews when you're going somewhere that values high quality employees. 
..Yet I've plugged the formula into a ti-89 and gotten the resulting graph... Regardless, even if you have to solve each point via iterative approximation you aren't modeling a predator that will die if it can't eat enough, and then graphing its population. So I'm not sure that I see your point. 
&gt; It's not hard pressed to say bosses love firing people if they don't have a use for them. I mean, maybe or maybe not. It depends on the size of the company and the manager's role in the company. If OP's manager is the owner and this means he can pocked an extra $100k of profit, then sure. If OP's manager is in middle management, he might not have much of an incentive at all to fire people. He may lose clout if he's only managing 10 people instead of 12. Given that this automates only 1/8th of a worker's work day, they may simply be able to process more work now and that will make his manager look great. It could make the department a lot more valuable and the manager could get a raise. Saying "bosses love firing people" is like a middle-schoolers idea of management that only watches Disney shows.
Congratulations, this looks amazing 
This is probably the worst avenue to go down. OP built this using company data at the very least, likely on company tools and hardware as well and accessing company databases. Legally it probably already belongs to the company even if OP worked on it outside of work.
It may....will have to play around with it a bit. 2 concerns I see at a glance. 1. It is a single contributor project at this time. Makes is a little risky to pull in as a dependency. 2. Not sure it supports python 3 (issue has been filed). Will have to look further to see for myself. Thanks for the pointer! When I saw it it jarred a recollection that I had seen this when I was still using google search some time ago. 
That's assuming the only thing they're doing is this particular task. He said all 12 employees spend 1 hour per day on this process -- which sounds like a reporting time sink. They will now be free to focus on their real jobs. I've done plenty of automated things in my job that amount to well over 40 hours a week, it doesn't mean people get fired, it means they focus on other things. We're not creating self check outs, we're usually just saying "man I am so sick of downloading this CSV every day, removing the zeroes, then creating this graph". 
For the dimensionless version, there is a tutorial on the scipy cookbook. https://scipy-cookbook.readthedocs.io/items/LoktaVolterraTutorial.html To the OP: This is like a 2D implementation of the Lotka-Voltera equations. Nicely done. 
IMO the safest route is to propose the idea to your manager as if you hadn't already done it. Maybe feel out the situation and potential impact it would have, and if you would be rewarded with anything for doing so. I don't know your current job title but if you could get a new title and raise to build tools for your department that would be awesome, especially if you're not a SWE yet. A great way to get your foot in the door.
We had this same debate, and ended up going the database-per-tenant route. Each tenant has their own database, separate from the other tenants. I think we've found there are upsides and downsides to this approach. Upsides: * Easy data isolation - there are zero concerns about accidentally exposing data from one customer to another, because the data lives in different databases. * Easy sharding - super easy to shard things because we can just take a bunch of tenants, and put them on a different database server. No worries about having some customer data on one server and some on another server, etc. * Very easy to do roll-outs and migrations - because we run database migrations on a per-database/per-tenant basis, it's very easy to do blue-green migrations/rolling migrations and do them per-tenant, without that affecting other tenants * Very easy dev/beta environments - we can easily deploy and test schema changes in test/staging instances (tenants), while knowing it doesn't affect anyone who is live/a real tenant * Very easy per-tenant backups - occasionally we need to do a backup or copy of a particular tenant's database, and this is quick and easy Downsides: * Not as efficient - lots of tenants = lots of databases. I'm sure it's not as efficient resource-wise as a single database. * You have to build systems to track which environment/database schema each tenant is at, and monitor that closely. You don't want the different databases to be at different versions for extended periods of time, or to get out of sync to a point where it becomes difficult to resolve them back to a single standard schema. * Reporting sucks - it's more difficult to get cross-tenant reporting, because you end up querying data from a bunch of different databases and combining it client-side. 
First you need to look at your employment contract if you have one and any related IP contracts. Some of these are ridiculous and state things like, whatever you think of on your own time with your own resources, we own. If you don't have anything barring you from owning this on your own time, and you really want to maximize the value of this thing, you could... \-Continue to polish this until it is something worth selling. If you can make it work through a web interface that is much better. \-Find another job and make the change \-Approach the company months after you left to say that you have an idea for a program that can save them $X/year and give them a price for it. I would go with a subscription model that delivers value to them, but makes it worth it to you. Let's say you are saving them approx. $40k/yr... I think an annual subscription in the $4-5k range would be perceived by the company as delivering value. If you give them a high one time price (&gt;$30k), odds are they will tell you to pound sand and take your idea to a firm that can program it for them at a cheaper price. If you can sell this to other companies then you might have something worth pursuing. Otherwise, you might as well tell your boss about it and give it to them for free, expecting nothing in return. It depends on how great of a job you currently have vs what you can find somewhere else, and how much this work can be applied to other companies.
Every programmer will encounter this situation. It is the nature of our jobs to save time. I once had the same approach as you and only ended up burning bridges. There is no good way to secure credit for your work. However, you can take comfort in that you will be rewarded in the future for your hard work, provided you continue at it and do not hang this over your superiors' heads as if you are superior. You're not familiar with all the investment that went into building the business and have admitted yourself you are green. Therefore, I suggest you do your work without the expectation for compensation. If you really need the money, then put this on your resume and market yourself to another company. It's possible your boss caves and rewards you when you approach; however, you're not always going to find immediate reward in life, and I'd argue that your boss's reward for this would be a bad lesson. You'll need to learn that later anyway. Focus on the fact that if you do hard work you will be rewarded later. If you find your boss is being a dick in the future, then just get out of there as it is likely a toxic company. Don't hang your hat on this one raise for one project.
Are you confusing different databases, with different database servers here? e.g. we do this: * DB master - this is a single virtual machine, that has 1000+ actual databases on it, one per tenant * DB slave 1 - this is a single virtual machine, that has 1000+ actual database on it, each mirrored from the master * DB slave 2 - this is a single virtual machine, that has 1000+ actual database on it, each mirrored from the master This is only 3 virtual machines to machine, for 1000+ actual customers. Yes, there are 3000+ actual databases, but only 3 actual Debian VMs. No big deal. For MariaDB/MySQL/PostgreSQL replication, you're going to need _a minimum_ of 3 separate servers. 1 master, 1 failover, and then one more so that when your master fails and you fail over, you still have a backup ready and in sync already. 
Even if he didn't use any company data or hardware it still probably belongs to them anyway because he made it for work. 
Thanks. What are your favorite sources of online data?
Well, say I write code like this to solve a predator-prey system: predators = 10 prey = 1000 while t&lt;tmax: dprey = ( birth * prey - capture * prey * predators ) * dt dpredators = ( growth * prey * predators - death * predators ) * dt prey += dprey predators += dpredators t+=dt Then I would say I have created 10 virtual predators and let them interact with 1000 virtual prey. But if I called the variables `x` and `y` instead, I would ‘just’ have been solving a DE. Conceptually, what’s the difference?
Hi, No I'm not confusing db servers with DBS. What you just explained is same as what I was explaining. So I am of the understanding that one Database can have multiple **schemas**. And that schema will be tenant specific . The schemas will contain the tables and other db artifacts. So I assume your **1000+ actual database** is actually referring to schema and server is analogies to database.. Am I right ?
Don't redraw the whole screen every time, figure out what parts changed and then redraw those.
If you did that then you wouldn't really be modeling the situation. That would be an example of the "cheating" I described. Instead model a predator. Have it move one square each turn. Have the prey also move one square, and even actively avoid the predators. Then say that if the predator doesn't eat for 3 turns it dies. And say that the prey population grows every time a prey comes into contact with another prey. But dies every time it comes into contact with a predator. You maths predicts the outcome. The logic that I used sets the stage and allows the outcome to be whatever it should be. (which, it

Hi, I have some questions - 1. Are you referring to multiple schemas when you say you are using different databases for each client ? Because if you are using separate database **server** itself then I imagine it's going to be very expensive affair. Am I right ? These customer specific schemas are all tied to one Database itself ? 2. So now assuming you have multiple schemas for each clients. How are you guys onboarding new clients ? So let me give you a example to better explain my question. So we are planning to have a sign up page with necessary payment gateway ( 3rd party will handle this ). Upon successful registration by a customer, he should gain access to the system. This means , the required schemas and artifacts should get created only after successful registration. So how should we proceed with this functionality ? I have an idea but I'm not sure if this is the right one. So I'm going to use postgresql for this. So once the new customer finishes the Registration process, I'll trigger the creation of a new schema and deploy all artifacts into it. Then we will make an entry of the schema with the tenant ID in a separate catalog table which will be referred , everytime a client logs in. This is what we are planning to do. Can you share your thoughts on this ?? 3. This one is application specific. So is it okay to have just one single instance of the application deployed ( load balancer and all that ) to serve multiple customers ?? Or do we need to deploy under subdomain a for each customer ?? If subdomain a needs to be done. How do we create it on the fly ? Like how do we make sure the route gets created once the registration is completed ?? Thanks.

Thank you &amp; I didn't know that Reddit existed sorry 
It depends on the organism. In microorganisms like zooplankton in lakes, there are predator-prey populations that can behave this way under controlled settings. For the vast majority of organisms, however, populations don't fluctuate this cleanly. That's because ecosystems are complex, high dimensional systems. These kinds of population models are still very useful. It's interesting to run them and then explore why they break and refine them. There's a classic in the population biology literature called "A Primer of Ecology" by Nicholas Gotelli tbat explores these kinds of theoretical models. 
Lots of people here are talking about people being replaced by machines, but based on your description, this is an incremental improvement of an existing workflow, so it may not be that anybody is replaced, just that everybody will work a bit faster. I think the reception will be positive, but that's for you to judge. As far as negotiations are concerned, the best approach depends very much on the people you're dealing with. First of all, you need to make an honest assessment for yourself of the costs of adopting what you've written. Does it only run on your machine so far? Is there a learning curve for your team? How many bugs do you expect to find before things run smoothly once used by everybody? Will you be pulled off for support and not be able to do your previous job? Next, are you quite sure of the calculations you've made about time savings? Don't pin down a single number, estimate a low ball and high ball number so you can get as good an assessment of the actual savings as possible. Also consider the cost of ongoing future maintenance. Before you present this to your boss, consider the effect on team moral if your boss treats you unfairly. Can you find an advocate/ally on your team that you can show this to before your boss? Will your team be happy that you created this? If so, how will they feel if you are not rewarded appropriately or even punished for something they would have loved to use themselves? Maybe your boss is stupid enough to try and rip you off, but that's a risk I would take, because there's also the chance that they are not so stupid and would be happy to reward you. Consider also that the level of understanding you have demonstrated about the processes on your team, such that you've been able to partially automate them, means that you're boss would be very stupid to punish you for this work. With all this in mind, give a demo of your work to your boss, maybe bring your advocate from the team. Be prepared that they may judge the savings to be different than you do. I would certainly try to negotiate a raise or some other benefit. I'd hate for good work to go to waste, and for people to waste their time on stuff that a machine could do, so I'd probably let them use it either way. You've already put in the work, and not being rewarded was a risk you took by doing that. If you are not rewarded appropriately, I'd plan to leave and to make a stink about your treatment. 
I’d you can pull in the company finical balance sheet and income statement and do a quarterly trend analysis you might have something. Also you would need the basic metrics for the market segment of all companies. 
In future you may want to build a prototype first give a demo of that, with a proposal of building it further to a workable version.
My point is that when you’re putting animal behavior into a simulation, you’re creating a mathematical model. You can make this as simple or as complicated as you want, but in the end you’ll still be solving a math problem, because that’s what computers do. For what it’s worth: Even in the simple model of the Lotka–Volterra equations you can end up with complete extinction of the predator (if you start with 0 prey, for example). The periodicity emerges only under the right conditions.
I actually have a background in dynamical systems modeling and control from an aerospace/electrical perspective. This is intersting to see the use of mathematics in biology, I wonder how nonlinear dynamics is utilized the field.
Any chance you've compared this to the isle Royale wolf/moose population they've been tracking for a while? This is SUPER cool! 
Your math isn't correct. Also the first y1= m*x1 + b can't return b because that's not how programming works (at least not basic python, sympy for example can do symbolic math)
Although job losses through productivity enhancements sound like a bad thing at first, they're actually a really good thing and means our society is getting more efficient. Best example is that around the founding of the US, about 90% of people were farming. Now, we accomplish the same thing with only 2% of the workforce. Obviously it takes some time for the market to place the newly freed up people, but efficiency gains will benefit everyone in the long run. 
Almost impossible for one person alone to do that.

Because they don't need to understand how it works, but instead that it works. Clearing out the time of multiple FTEs or even just one FTE is a significant shift in balance on a team. There's also the possibility that you are now completely overqualified for the job and it is seen just that. &amp;#x200B; OP's job is probably going to be fine, for now, but he did shift the paradigm. Not every team is ready to evolve into such efficiency. So, either the others on his team will try to shoot holes in the process (as they should; think of it as free QA), they will ignore it (if it depends on them changing their process) and not adopt it, or boss will have to make adjustments on the team to deal with the severe increase in resources.
b = y1 - (m*x1)?
What's the "right" thing here then? Of the possible paths I'm real curious to hear what you think is the obvious "right". 
There are way too many bad responses here. Just bring it up to your boss and don't expect immediate compensation. I built my career around trying to automate myself out of a job and good managers take notice. If not, you should look around for another job where someone does take notice. From my experience, companies don't hold onto good employees without paying them well.

Sure, depends on the situation, but if OP made all this code 100% on their time using no company resources, seems like that would be difficult? If the code really is amazing they could lawyer up and try to outspend OP...idk, seems pretty shitty to be honest, I'm sure you are right that some would do it no questions tho.
MySQL/MariaDB doesn't distinguish between DATABASE and SCHEMA - they are synonyms/the same thing. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11618277/difference-between-schema-database-in-mysql Other databases do have both of these separate concepts (e.g. PostgreSQL https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/ddl-schemas.html ). 3 physical servers, each running Debian. MySQL/MariaDB running on each. 1000 individual tenant databases on each of those. There's really no extra management overhead involved in having 1000 databases on a single database server, vs. having 1 database on a single database server. It's definitely viable.

Your perspective is incredibly jaded and conservative. Why would the boss immediately assume he doesn’t need OP? In my experience, companies that have team-scale manual reporting processes don’t have Python devs laying around to maintain this sort of work. OP just made himself invaluable, not expendable. 
We're using MariaDB, so there isn't a distinction between schemas and databases. They are distinct databases, on a single physical master server, and then are all replicated to 2x physical slave servers. The way we handle sign-ups is: * ahead of time, generate several hundred databases, create all tables, etc. * when someone signs up, push their specific signup information into the next available/unused database * record that in a separate database that tracks all of our sign-ups I'm not 100% clear on what you mean by "one single instances of the application deployed". Do you mean one single copy of the actual application code? If so, then yes, you should have a single copy of the code deployed (or maybe 2 copies if you're doing blue-green deploys). You absolutely should _not_ have code deployed separately for each tenant. You can do subdomains if you want. Up to you. Use wildcard DNS, and then look at the HTTP Host header that the browser sends you to determine what subdomain you're on in-app.

Structured equation modeling and differential equations are sometimes used in theoretical ecology -- often to represent null models of how a system is expected to behave. The problem with populatio biology is that it's nearly impossible to prove nonlinear models empirically. Population biologists that collect these kinds of data for real organisms in the field typically lean on mixed-effects modeling and regression for with data collecred under experimentally controlled settings (or as controlled as we can get then). The most exciting mathematical models in population biology tend to come out of bayesians, because those models can accommodate uncertainty in parameter estimates that you see when sampling populations of organisms in the wild. And geneticists and the field of bioinformatics -- theoretical mathematical models hold better at the scale of genes and genomes than whole organisms. But we'll get there. EO Wilson wrote a book about this, called Consilience, if you are curious.
There's no reason why the stochastic simulation should give results that look like the math equations. Even two stochastic simulations will most likely give wildly different results. So it doesn't tell you much. One thing you could do eventually is see how the average solution evolves as the number of simulations grows. But this can be more accurately calculated by solving the differential equations.

There's no obvious "right". There's a hope that the work environment you inhabit is more cordial. That everybody is working together on a team, and that if you found those things it wouldn't be cutthroat. That you would be rewarded, and your team would be protected to the largest extent possible. 
If you generate the db ahead of time. Doesn't it take up resources that you may or may not use ? I mean you'll be paying for it even if no one is using it now.
I'm really surprised by all the negativity in these comments. OP, I was a non-technical employee who noticed a similar problem at my office and worked nights and weekends to fix it. A few years later, I've literally doubled my salary and am working my dream job in an engineering role. Your boss might care a whole lot. They might care a little. They might not care at all. Most likely, they'll approve and string you along into thinking that this could turn into a raise/promotion in X months... But whatever happens, you've demonstrated value and initiative. If your boss doesn't care, hit the job market and impress a hiring manager with this story.
It doesn't look like they support [asyncio webapps](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/forums/topic/13815/) sadly. They do [now](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/forums/topic/12878/) support Python 3.7, so maybe they'll support webapps soon.
so...this will probably play out like this: boss will ask you to build this project in addition to your work load (it will now become a new task that has deadlines..etc that you are accountable for). once its complete you will be asked to document it and train someone to use it. you lose your job or get laterally transferred. 
I suggest keeping it to yourself until you have a job interview. Tell them you created something that saved your team blah blah blah, etc etc. When you leave and they notice productivity tanking, you may be asked to come back with more pay later on. 
Sorry can you explain exactly what it's doing? Like how is it actually saving time? What task is being accomplished here? Is it just measuring project performance or something? More context makes it easier to explain how to deliver it.
I looked into those early on and of those, only asthmatics is cross-platform. curses and blessing are Linux only I believe.. Part of this for me is learning lower-level operations and not just feeding parameters into a library of screen/widget makers. (I do that all day long with PyQt) Sure, it's re-inventing the wheel, but that's part of the fun for me.
You sound like you agree with me. Did you mean to reply to me or the other guy?
Moreover if the only one benefiting from it is your employer, why would you *want* to progress?

Easy, seen it before someone automates enough of their work, and someone else can upkeep it. Or maybe nobody else can but the process is old and doesn't need changing. Leaves little room to keep someone. As with monzzter, you should see their reaction and gauge it, look for a new company, or my own choice take on more work and use my python scripts to automate huge amounts of my job. Does my boss know, some. But not to the extent that 40% of my job roughly is automated. But she praises me constantly for how much I get done with little error in comparison to fellow workers. You can always gloat about your savings on your resume even if your company took little notice. 
Yeah plus why is he assuming the boss is a massive cunt? Plenty of businesses would give someone a raise for this

I meant to reply to you. You say that we should simulate the stochastic process. But it's really hard to extract precise information from them. While a small scale PDE is relatively easy to solve. Why should we choose the former?
Thank you. This thread is fuckin ridiculous
Although good advice, let’s remember that OP did this on his own time outside of the office using company data. Unauthorized. This could be a breach of the company’s security policy. 
How many resources do you expect an empty database with no queries against it to take? It's extremely minimal... and hardware/disk is cheap. And eventually, we _will_ use it (unless of course we just stop getting customers forever and go out of business, but at that point that's the least of your worries!)
I don’t disagree with you either. I just wonder where you put the line between ‘cheating’ and ‘non-cheating’ models, as mathematically there’s no difference between simulating virtual predators and prey, and solving a system of equations that represents that predator-prey system.
I'm saying that seeing the model emerge from a stochastic process is different than simply plotting the PDE. He's saying that it isn't. That they are the same thing. I'm also saying that seeing the result emerge from a stochastic model is more interesting than simply plotting the PDE. For something like perturbation/nonlinear dynamics using the PDE is definitely advantageous. But that's not really the topic here.

I agree with the parent's approach fully. Early on in my career, I used the SDK of a tool that I was hired to work on, to automate a large amount of work. Instead of manually doing something for a few solid days, I took the better part of a day, learned the SDK and built the tool so that if something like this came to us again, it would be quick and easy. I was pretty proud of myself while telling my boss (who was usually friendly and open). Nope, all hell broke loose. I had to redo the work manually while being supervised by another team member. I wish I could say this was a good experience in the end, but it wasn't. I eventually left the company, partly because of that incident and it affected my work ethic to where I would only do the bare minimum and avoid trying to learn new tools. It took me years of working for better bosses to get over that mindset. 
Thank you for the info. pyhton vs python is my number one typo ;) Followed by gti vs git Changed it.
Essentially I have to load data into an in house software program. The in house software uses SQL as the back end. I write observations and variances on health claims data. I found a way to automate it to do it for me by using a combo of tkinter, pymssql, and selenium.
Depending on the nature of your employer it may be best for you to just use this for your own productivity enhancement (browse reddit for an hour while your automation takes care of this problem, or do other stuff and look like a superstar). As others have pointed out, there's a built in tension between employer and employee and in some working scenarios you may be disappointed by the lack of recognition or reward. At my current job I'd share it with the team and know that it'd come back to me. At my previous one, nope, boss was an asshole, I'd have kept it to myself. 
&gt; I'm saying that seeing the model emerge from a stochastic process is different than simply plotting the PDE. He's saying that it isn't. That they are the same thing. No I’m not; I’m saying that _solving_ a PDE is equivalent to simulating a system with the same dynamics.
&gt; Your perspective is incredibly jaded and conservative Not really. How much corporate experience do you have?
Just to nitpick, I believe those 2% is doing more work due to population increase. 
It's not jaded, it's realistic. There's a conflict of interest between employer and employee. Employers need to keep their employees happy. Employees need to recognize their own value and use it to negotiate. 
Maybe I'm not understanding you. &gt; solving a PDE is equivalent to simulating a system with the same dynamics. Sounds to me like you're saying they are effectively the same. But you said they weren't just before that. So what am I missing?
Some jobs may be automated but that automation can cause negative side-effects. For example, automating manual pulling of weeds with pesticide spaying but the pesticides turned out to be unhealthy and the workers are now stuck in a fluorescent call center trying to scam people instead (not saying that happened in every case, trying to give more of a hypothetical). Automation isn't inherently good in every case, I think that's naive to assume.
You have my sword.
My first comment in this chain: &gt; Conceptually there’s no difference between modeling predator-prey interaction and solving a differential equation that models predator-prey interaction, as the first case reduces to the latter. You are the one who’s been claiming solving DEs is ‘cheating’.
It's the same difference as empirical vs theoretical, IMO. The simulation generates emperical data to check the theoretical model against. Seeing that the two end up with very similar results is a bit of a validation that the theory is at least close to correct. That the logic and assumptions used in deriving the formula were correct. 
I will give you my perspective without a specific example. I did some research recently on which programming languages are used where in the business computing which is my main sector. For the combination of Web Dev, Data Science/ML, System Administration, the main languages and corresponding stacks build around them are: Python, Java, and Scala (based on semantics you might consider Scala as part of the Java ecosystem). Python is the only scripting one which means that in most cases it is the fittest option if you want your team to move fast or because your team is small, as in my case now, you cannot have separate people working with separate languages and/or stacks. For example R could be better for Data Science or something that involves statistics, but you cannot do Web. I used to love RubyOnRails but there is not much Ruby as you go deeper into the Data Science areas, there are some libraries and practitioners but the whole ecosystem is at least niche. Before saying why I like it as a language, say its OO paradigm, the whole application of decorators, list comprehension, etc. Excluding the Python community as a whole (people, material, books), before getting there... it is a one way if you want your code bases to transcend different domains. Last (for parents) there are a couple of "learn Python building a small game" books around, so you can introduce your young relatives to programming, without learning something new (my father had to learn Logo, back in antiquity). If you want a simple example: I am working on a web app that sends data to a queue that are being processed by an NLP model, while soon I will introduce more of them, and I also have some command line utilities. I could not imagine doing these in another programming language. I could use Java but then I would have a velocity problem, which I can discuss if anyone wants me to elaborate more.
Not specific to Python but generally loading MySQL... Opening connection &gt; insert a single row &gt; close connection... for every single row... is very inefficient. Yeah if you have a small data set or throw enough horse power at the problem it works fine but that doesn't make it OK. If you're inserting a lot of rows then you'll want to batch them up somehow and do a mass insert. Cut it up into chunks, do a bulk insert or some other strategy to insert a set of data instead of just a single row. 
I know it can be bad in some companies but this seems extra ridiculous. Id love to hear the reason your boss was upset and wanted it redone
Just ask the companies nicely for all their records 
Really good advice, thank you! 
I remember it was really cool but the main problem was to find a decent jsonapi javascript client implementation. Has the situation changed? 
what do you mean by self improvement program?
Because that would be the only reason for a post like that to be topical here. 
Our network service team does a similar thing.. But every month. They call it load planning. Basically they pull data from different sources and generate a big excel file with graphs and all. It took a team of 3 people about 4 days. (we had about 1000 servers back then). I developed a system with one other Dev to basically automate all this and reduce the time to 2-3 hours. In the beginning they were all happy that they will not have to do this boring task by hand and the tool being developed will reduce their effort. When they realized a few weeks into project what actually was happening they stopped sharing data source access and project was shelved. 
It doesn't sound like these coworkers will lose their jobs because this is just a small part of their job (~1 hour/day).
You'll want to read up on [evolutionary algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm), which can effectively be used to build programs that improve their output relative to some pre-defined benchmark. You'll _also_ want to read [how to ask](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).
Is the code improving itself or is it improving you? 
**Evolutionary algorithm** In artificial intelligence, an evolutionary algorithm (EA) is a subset of evolutionary computation, a generic population-based metaheuristic optimization algorithm. An EA uses mechanisms inspired by biological evolution, such as reproduction, mutation, recombination, and selection. Candidate solutions to the optimization problem play the role of individuals in a population, and the fitness function determines the quality of the solutions (see also loss function). Evolution of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
don't use - on a variable to get it to negative, python has to check for types so it will not work in this language, whatever you want negative explicitly multiply it by -1 like: -1 \* x
Thank the lord there's at least one reasonable person commenting in this thread.
That's good to know thank you!
True Story: I once automated myself out of a job.
This is when you approach them with your idea about developing this software. Just be prepared to consider what options might be on the table. 1. They tell you great, build it on company time 1. They tell you great, we'll hire someone else to building 1. They tell you they aren't interested "it wont work" etc, etc. I would be offering to do it as "contract work, on the side, separate from my job because it is not one of my job duties". 
The OP could make it more generic and accept inputs that are configurable where one configuration would match company records so it would appeal to more companies/applications in addition to not being tied to the company data.
I guess I'll just respond here. &amp;#x200B; I once had a job that my boss was somewhat receptive to me coding as well. At the lab I worked at, we were using google drive sheets for quite literally everything. I had some experience with Django, so I decided to create a system to track and analyze all the data from lab processes. I showed my prototype, got a little bit extra time to work on it, etc. &amp;#x200B; They never ended up using it, however, because they were too "stuck" on their google sheets. They ended up starting to ask me to code macros, pull from API's for lab test results and things for them in their sheets, and when I didn't keep up to date on them all (coding wasn't my job, I was technically a lab technician), I would get shit for it. Essentially, my job just became more intensive and I when I tried to ask for a raise, they said that I "wasn't working hard enough." &amp;#x200B; The reason I bring this up is because I believe you when you say you have a way to increase efficiency at the job you are at. But, be sure that you have the position or raise you want before you provide or show them what they need. &amp;#x200B; I hope I don't come off as pessimistic, but realize that a company doesn't have your best interest in mind. Simply put, you need to make sure you put yourself first and get what you need out of the exchange, because no one else is looking out for you.
Coming up on 10 years. It all boils down to the company’s appetite for innovation and their willingness to reinvest efficiency gains. At a former company, I taught an unsanctioned group of 12 people Python one hour a week (plus loads of personal time) as a means to both professional development and to solve business problems. We pitched this first to our bosses, then to a few executive sponsors after we had proved efficiency gains. After I moved on, this led to a colleague being promoted and others used that experience to move to better positions elsewhere. It was all enabled by our organization’s acceptance of innovation, so this may not translate to others. My take is that a company unwilling to view these sorts of self-motivated initiatives as positive probably isn’t a good place to work in the first place. 
If you want to keep your job and get paid more, consider making your automation slightly less sophisticated so nobody but you knows how to run it. Better to be the one guy that can do 12 people's work in 15 minutes than one of the 12 people who got replaced by a script
1. If you're already asking about how to approach your boss, then that likely means that you don't have a great relationship with this person - otherwise you'd actually know how to approach your boss. So, if I were in your shoes, I'd be talking to my coworkers and my lead so that they can evangelize it to your boss. 2. Don't be expected to receive any immediate payment for this contribution. You may not even get recognition. Make sure you keep a log; the best logs are found in your resume. 3. There are far more positions that are open for software developers than there are for people to fill them. This means that if your goal is a higher paycheck, you should stick around for a good 18-24 months in your current position and then look for a new one. 4. Overall, however, I do not recommend swapping positions every 24 months. There are a few reasons for this, but the biggest ones are: a. your paycheck will grow with the value you can provide to you company (assuming your company survives and prospers) b. you won't understand the mistakes you're really making if you hop out every 24 months because you likely won't be able to see what happens with your code long(er) term. c. digging in and sticking around for 3-4 years will likely net you a promotion in your current company.
I agree overall. If I were OPs manager I would be ecstatic. But I've also worked for places where the pessimistic, conservative approach to this was absolutely validated, and yes, it was a crappy place to work, but sometimes you can be in a place where that crappy job is your only option besides unemployment. 
I’m a data analyst. I do a bunch of different tasks on my team but primarily ETL and analysis of health care plans and claims for different companies. I also consult and create recommendations on how to lower costs for their group. Thank you for the advice by the way. It’s realistic and safe. A bunch of people have given me similar advice.
Ah, sorry I didn't put it in /r/learnpython . I probably should have put this in the original post but there are no versions of python in registered and unregistered versions even after installing python. &amp;#x200B;
Completely agreed. I was mostly taking issue with the above opinion that “this will blow up in your face.” More practical advice is to proceed with caution. 
Seems legit
&gt; Although job losses through productivity enhancements sound like a bad thing at first, they're actually a really good thing and means our society is getting more efficient. Only if you believe that the only possible end-game here is a star trek-like utopia where we use those productivity gains from automation to replace monotonous jobs to better all of society with other humanistic pursuits that aren't directly tied to production or profit (e.g. the arts, basic sciences, exploration, etc.). However, the reality is that our political and economic systems are not currently set up for that, and current progress in automation is vastly outpacing [1] our ability to adapt against our darwinian predispositions towards "fairness" and "equity" (e.g. why should someone get something they didn't directly work for!) So instead further automation currently has us careening towards the (IMHO much more likely) dystopia where (ironically automated) killbots are protecting increasing piles of rich asshole's cash from the now-unemployed masses. [1] E.g. Do you believe we will have something like universal basic income in-place when the amazon warehouse workers, mcdonalds cashiers, long-haul truck drivers, etc. are replaced with automation in the next 10-20 years? Are the gains from that automation really going to benefit 99% of the population enough to offset loss of that primary income, or are the 1% just going to consolidate all of it to buy a new yacht? Are we currently set up to help the hundreds of millions of people worldwide with displaced jobs due to automation in the coming century or are we more likely to tell them to stop being lazy and find another job from an increasingly and vanishing list of impossibility? ------------- TL;DR IMHO progress in automation is currently vastly outpacing the social progress necessary to make it truly beneficial to humanity. Eliminate jobs at your own peril!
Gotcha that's awesome man congrats
From my experience... Not only will OP not get any reward, OP will now have to maintain the script and potentially could get in trouble if there is a bug or hiccup of any kind once the business starts to rely on it. 
It is not more efficient giving more money to a couple of douchebags who don't care about efficiency nor sustainability.
I coded myself out of my job. :-) &amp;#x200B; Well, that was sort of by design. After college, the job market was at a slump so I did clerical work in the upstairs office of a warehouse and was tasked with manually getting data from an old mainframe and hand-typing different numbers to make a bigger report. I streamlined the days-long weekly task to a 30-minute data-entry task with macros doing the rest, producing a nicely-formatted spreadsheet for the bosses. And then one of them realized I could skip the data entry by having their IT department allow me to import the raw data into their spreadsheet. Report generated in seconds. After that was all done, I had tons of free time, which freed my time to find an actual engineering job. My boss was totally cool with it. &amp;#x200B;
I know postgres comes with a builtin spanish dictionary for full text search. Whether that helps with sentiment analysis I don't know.
You can get their quarterly filings from the [SEC’s EDGAR Database](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html) as well as any supplemental filings and filings by insiders of the company. Then you will have to somehow process and extract something useful from them. Getting the reports probably isn’t the issue as that is not difficult, but processing them and then finding something useful in them likely is more difficult.
What? &gt;&gt;&gt; x = 5 &gt;&gt;&gt; -x -5
currently the wealth from those productivity gains is being very effectively captures by business owners &amp;#x200B; [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real\_wages#/media/File:US\_productivity\_and\_real\_wages.jpg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_wages#/media/File:US_productivity_and_real_wages.jpg) &amp;#x200B; it isn't impacting wages at all.
Self improvement doesn't say anything. What do you want the program to do? Figure that out, write steps to achieve it and do it. If you know Python, you can do it.
Maybe brandit messed up the same way I did. I thought I was doing a good thing, but I put the company outside of license compliance. I partially automated a specialized hardware testing device when I was in college by reading bits and pieces of example code the company posted on their website. What I didn't read was that using the API required a separate license that my employer did not purchase. 
TLDR: Put the project in terms of business value (estimation of dollar value saved, or how it enables new work to start). Then get some documentation in place (emails) to cover your a$$ (CYA)--in the unlikely event that things go badly. My approach on this would be to put this in terms of business value. You already have done a decent job, but go a step further and get dollar value. E.g. if this saves 60hr/week that's 1.5 full time jobs. If the average salary is $60k then you've just saved the company $90k/yr. This goes onto your resume right now, e.g. 'saved company $90k annually by automating lab analysis'. Next, if your boss isn't as receptive as you thought they would be then help them to see the value. 'Hey this saves 1hr/day from each person, do you think we could use our new free time to start initiative X that you talked about last year? E.g. Ask a leading question, don't tell. That way ultimately its your bosses idea, and he's the hero. When you make your boss look good they will tend to go to bat for you in return. Finally, just in case things go bad with your boss you need some supporting evidence to protect yourself. After meeting with the boss summarize the meeting in an email. Hit key points like: while building this it didn't impact your daily work, that your boss had knowledge of this initiative, that it would save time, and whatever the outcome of the meeting was. That email might sound like: &gt; As you may recall three months ago when I approached you about proposing to work on X, you supported the idea as long as it wouldn't impact my work. Since that time I've completed the project and can now roll this out to save Y hours across the team weekly, and I did this without impacting my day to day responsibilities. Thank you for being so supportive encouraging me to continue on this. I am thankful for your support to roll this out to the team _OR_ While I am disappointed that you do not want to proceed with rolling this out I respect your decision. ... The point of that email is it protects you if things go bad. E.g. you can take the email to your boss' boss to ask for help if your boss suddenly turns on you, or if the boss takes all the credit and you start to get dumped on. Bonus points if you have an email to show as evidence that you proposed this originally and boss supported the idea. Great work, keep this attitude through your career and you'll go places.
Just show him. I'm sure there is plenty of work to go around. It'll let everyone focus on bigger and better things and you'll be seen as a person who can craft solutions to problems.

I would like to have a guarantee that for any transformation of a bbox (such as scaling) when new boundary falls between float resolution the bbox always grow. That is left/bottom edge is rounded down, and top/right rounded up. Otherwise, with few transformations, you can manoeuvre out a point from the inside to the outside.

Hi! Thanks for reading the book and for the comment. Interesting questions, I might consider adding clarifications int he book. However, in the meanwhile: 1. vars() gives you a 1:1 version of the class. While I may accept this can be the case a lot of times, as entities shouldn't contain too much logic, I didn't want to be too strict about this. One case that comes to my mind is the support to previous versions of the class, which may still be passed by older components of the system. Does it make sense? I'll think about it, however, maybe I'm wrong. 2. CA is unfortunately no more that common anywhere. It's a pity, since it is not a recent invention. On the contrary, it's a piece of "ancient wisdom" that we forgot. Robert Martin has to be given the credit of being one of the voices that started talking again about this. Some people say that he does a living out of going around pontificating about how other people should do their job, but I give him the merit of digging up something that was lost. Sorry, I'm rambling. That said, there is not that much CA around, but a good finding that I made recently is that Conda (https://github.com/conda/conda) is modelled after it! See this tweet https://twitter.com/kalefranz/status/1078795620796772352 by Kale Franz, Tech Lead of Anaconda, Inc. 3. I have to give this question a little time to sink in order to give a proper response, so for the time being I'd just say that probably microservices should be the component of a macro clean architecture. The risk is to overengineer small components, adding layers (the CA) where you don't really need them, if you see what I mean. I will think about it, however, maybe I can give you a better answer. Thanks again!
Agreed. I automated something on my own at my last job. When I was given the assignment before, the boss would tend to ask if it would be ready in circa 2-3 days, which is what it took my predecessor. The software I wrote could start in the morning and spit out the final product by lunch. My only reward was getting more work. :-( It would have been much better to keep my mouth shut, let my boss think I was working hard on his extra requests in the future and have him avoid piling on any extra work until I was done. 
From the investment perspective of people who work as quants: "Technical analysis" is to "quantitative analysis" as "astrology" is to "astronomy". 
I'm confused by the reasons you cited for not job hopping. I read this article a while ago and perceived it as an eye opener: https://www.forbes.com/sites/cameronkeng/2014/06/22/employees-that-stay-in-companies-longer-than-2-years-get-paid-50-less/ You seem to be claiming basically the opposite, do you have any sources or is it just personal experience? Tldr if the article: yearly salary change in a same job will likely be way lower than what you'd get in another job if you do switch. In my experience, it's easier to market myself to new employers with new skills that I gained recently than to wait for an opening in my current company while I am not stuck with a project that would prevent an in-house change of responsibilities because my boss would say no. 
that's weird... vscode tells me error when I do that...

A few counterpoints to your hypothetical critiques: Ingesting pesticides is better for your health than malnutrition and starving to death, which used to happen extremely regularly across the globe until modern agriculture came along. I find your example of scammers in call centers to be myopic: there have always been marginalized, desperate, or plain greedy people who will do anything to survive, including robbing, confidence scams, selling snake oil, committing fraud, stealing land, all the way up to committing genocide to get ahead. I don't think we can blame technological advances for the fact that morality means jack shit for many people when the alternative is poverty, slavery, starvation, or death. All that said, I don't fundamentally disagree that automation isn't inherently good in every case. However, I do find a lot of the pushback against automation (and societal/technological progress in general) to be short-sighted and reactionary in many cases.
r/Isonium is correct. If you look into this many people are already doing this with python. I worked on doing this for a finance class before I graduated and it's not impossible. Check out my [short presentation](https://www.slideshare.net/MichaelWentz6/do-hedge-funds-profit-from-public-information) about hedge funds downloading data from the SEC.
Why tho? When you want to perform some _action_, you call a function. So, why merely _mention_ the function’s name - you’d better _call_ the function. 
&gt; You seem to be claiming basically the opposite, do you have any sources or is it just personal experience? 23 years of professional (getting paid for it) software development.

This looks very powerful. Reminds me of something you would see in F# or Haskell - where you work very hard to describe your types and then the actual amount of code you write is next to none as a result. Good comparision with Flask-Restless and Flask-Restful... of course now I'm wondering: how does it compare with Falcon and other REST Api products?

Rules of the game are such that the optimal play is selfish. Hate the game, not the players.
Because in many other command line interfaces (terminals, matlab, etc.), 'exit' is the way to quit out. 
More efficient. I believe it's due to the compiler having all of the information in one line rather than performing loop unpacking. They are also much nicer to look at IMO. some_list = ['stuff', 123, 'nachos'] strings = [s for s in some_list if type(s) is str] or strings = [] for s in some_list: if type(s) is str: strings.append(s)
Sadly not, [aiohttp](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/2902) has decided not to adopt the ASGI standard. You can use [Quart](https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart), [Starlette](https://github.com/encode/starlette), [Responder](https://github.com/kennethreitz/responder) or other ASGI frameworks. You can use aiohttp to send requests though.
I would argue that optimal play in the "short game" is selfish. That optimal play in the "long game" isn't, but that the game is a little bit biased towards players in the short game.

Technically it compiles into byte-code before running so it's both.
Well, the logical argument that is made in the article seems sound enough to me. Still, thanks for the answer!
I recommend sending EOT (Ctrl-D) as it works in many interactive CLI programs, including shell. It is also much faster than thinking what command should be used ("exit"? "quit"? "close"? Or maybe it's "logout" this time?) and typing :) WARNING: Ctrl-D has the same problem as ":wq" and tab key! ;) 
You need an If statement for if hour is &gt; 12 or not. 
I get it, that doesn't stop me from screwing it up... every damn time. :)
Or the classic: ctrl+c ctrl+c ctrl+c ctrl+z kill %1
Clearly the interpreter recognizes you want to exit given that special message. So it's clearly not a keyword used by anything else. So why not drop the message and treat it as a special case shortcut? I've always been confused about that too.
The byte-code generated by the interpreter isn't compiled code but just an intermediary form that the python vm. Python can be compiled (see PyPy or Numba or Cython)but the standard implementation is not compiled nor jited.
I’m using the VPN and they allow us connection to their network with viewonly rights. My IP address is protected via their firewall.
Whats the problem with :wq and tab?
Still easier than vi
ditto. 
After a while you are trying to use them everywhere, for example ":wq" in a word processor, tab in Windows command line etc. 
Yes, but it’s still _compiled_ to bytecode. Compilation doesn’t necessarily imply translation to assembly or machine code. So, the code executed by the VM is still compiled: not for a real CPU, but for the VM
Don't show it! Use it for yourself and use the extra time to browse Reddit!
What error? 
You can use `from dis import dis` to view disassembly. The list comprehension will be faster because CPython knows the object is a list and can optimize based on that. Using a for-loop and append, CPython just knows there is some object with a method called `.append()` which it must look up. List comprehension: ``` 2 0 LOAD_CONST 1 (&lt;code object &lt;listcomp&gt;&gt;) 2 LOAD_CONST 2 ('list_comp.&lt;locals&gt;.&lt;listcomp&gt;') 4 MAKE_FUNCTION 0 6 LOAD_FAST 0 (x) 8 GET_ITER 10 CALL_FUNCTION 1 12 RETURN_VALUE Disassembly of &lt;code object &lt;listcomp&gt;&gt;: 2 0 BUILD_LIST 0 2 LOAD_FAST 0 (.0) &gt;&gt; 4 FOR_ITER 12 (to 18) 6 STORE_FAST 1 (y) 8 LOAD_FAST 1 (y) 10 POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE 4 12 LOAD_FAST 1 (y) 14 LIST_APPEND 2 16 JUMP_ABSOLUTE 4 &gt;&gt; 18 RETURN_VALUE ``` Straight loop: ``` 2 0 BUILD_LIST 0 2 STORE_FAST 1 (temp) 3 4 SETUP_LOOP 26 (to 32) 6 LOAD_FAST 0 (x) 8 GET_ITER &gt;&gt; 10 FOR_ITER 18 (to 30) 12 STORE_FAST 2 (y) 4 14 LOAD_FAST 2 (y) 16 POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE 10 5 18 LOAD_FAST 1 (temp) 20 LOAD_METHOD 0 (append) 22 LOAD_FAST 2 (y) 24 CALL_METHOD 1 26 POP_TOP 28 JUMP_ABSOLUTE 10 &gt;&gt; 30 POP_BLOCK 6 &gt;&gt; 32 LOAD_FAST 1 (temp) 34 RETURN_VALUE ```
Yup. I doubt citadel, rentech, two sigma, etc are having their analysts use technical analysis.
You're showing them employer how either really useful, or replaceable by code. Always the thought when making things lije this. If I can make this and save x time, what stops someone from making y and replacing me?
&gt;can I expect to be compensated for this/promoted no
By that standard most compilers aren't compilers either. The x86 machine code generated by a compiler isn't compiled code but just an intermediary form that gets interpreted or jited by firmware into microcode which is then actually run by the hardware.
I believe that's just the __repr__ for the exit function
[Uh](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html) I don't [know](http://howtopython.org/en/latest/the-interpreter/) what to tell [you](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/which-python/). [Python](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) is an not in general compiled nor is it understood to be compiled by the python community nor the larger computer science community. In some ways the CPython interpreter can be see as both a compiler and interpreter due to the intermediary byte code generation but that is just a front end of an interpreter and classifying that as a compiler would classifly most interpreters as compilers.
Wow - this what happens ehen you ask an applications programmer ibstead of a game developer. Use libtcod http://roguecentral.org/doryen/data/libtcod/doc/1.5.1/index2.html https://github.com/libtcod/python-tcod 
There's also the [Financial Statements and Notes Datasets](https://www.sec.gov/dera/data/financial-statement-and-notes-data-set.html) which have every filing for each quarter. Making it easier to download and process.
:wq
actually so sexy. &gt;&gt;&gt; str(exit) 'Use exit() or Ctrl-D (i.e. EOF) to exit'
&gt; intermediary Is it intermediary? This bytecode isn’t further optimized, nor is it translated to another representation later on. It is to be executed by CPython’s VM, so it can’t be classified as an intermediate representation. You also can compile a Python file to bytecode, destroy the original source and still be able to run the bytecode alone, via the VM. Interpreters can also re-parse the input on each run, execute the instructions by traversing the AST or dispose of intermediate representations upon completion, so I’m not sure _most_ interpreters would be classified as compilers under such a definition. I think what is an interpreter and what isn’t is pretty meta because one can straight up interpret, like, x86 bytecode, and now C and C++ are suddenly interpreted languages lol
Or just search them up? 
they couldn't def \_\_repr\_\_(self): sys.exit(0) ?
update to 3.6 my dude
What do you mean? :wq [Esc] :wq :wq!
You can fix that easily with this snippet: ### Set Up Instant Command Shortcuts def cd(folder): """e.g. cd('/bin')""" os.chdir(folder) def pwd(): """current path""" return os.path.abspath('.') def quit(): print('[√] Insta-quit') raise SystemExit(0) def warn_repr_globals(): raise Exception('__repr__ of globals was stopped to protect from insta-quit command being accidentally triggered.') def listdir(dir=None): return os.listdir(dir or os.getcwd()) class InstantShortcut: """run a command instantly on __repr__, without needing parens to call it""" callable = lambda: [] def __init__(self, command, output_delimiter=''): self.callable = command self.output_delimiter = output_delimiter def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs): return self.callable(*args, **kwargs) def __repr__(self): return self.output_delimiter.join(self()) _GLOBALS_REPR_WARNING_ = InstantShortcut(warn_repr_globals) quit = q = InstantShortcut(quit) pwd = InstantShortcut(pwd) ls = InstantShortcut(listdir, ' ') ll = InstantShortcut(listdir, '\n') _GLOBALS_REPR_WARNING_ = InstantShortcut(warn_repr_globals) # define twice to be safe because print order of globals() is not guaranteed to print _GLOBALS_REPR_WARNING_ before quit() 
Kind of.
Why are you still using 3.5?
A lot of the cynicism in this thread comes from experience :/ technical people tend to be rather idealistic in the beginning of their career, until they discover sales and managemnt are trying to exploit/rent-seek them. Most of the time, people get paid for their profile, not because of what they are actually worth. Otherwise, biz wouldnt profit. Loyalty to a company is ridiculous.
Sounds like a few python scripts to manipulate data and push out a chart. If his employer would benefit from this, why shouldn't he? Or if OP is feeling nice he can calc the hours it took to write, and charge an hourly rate.
In fact, you can define a class that overrides `__repr__` with a call to `exit()` so that typing it in the console bare will quit it. If I remember, I'll post some code later.
I agree with your points, a cpu is basically just a very fast hardware interpreter for an isa, but there is a value in calling a program that runs in that particular isa 'compiled'. Some programming languages that are compiled to bytecode are called compiled by virtue of their speed (C#/Java) which does muddy the water quite a bit, and makes it sort of a pick and choose game. That being said, if I poll the wider community 99/100 would say python is interpreted and they would say it is factually wrong to say python is a compiled language outside of the offical implementation.
At least he's using 3.
They do the exact same thing this code is doing.... they iterate over time series data and get statistics from it.... and find “patterns” that return positive expected value. It doesn’t matter what that pattern looks like. Whether it’s a head and shoulders and nothing else, or something watching every tick of every security 24/7 for any odd movement. 
I type exit() in Windows, often after attempting ^D, because ^Z &lt;CR&gt; is too awkward.
My guess is that Conan (for some ungodly reason) depends on a specific version of pylint, and you have a version of pylint already, which means it needs to be uninstalled. However, your current version of pylint was installed not using the modern `setuptools`, which has sane uninstalling built in, but the old-fashioned `distutils`, which does not. So the old pylint cannot be uninstalled, which means the new pylint cannot be installed, which means conan can't be installed. I would recommend installing it from one of the OS-specific packages, if possible - then it doesn't pull pip into it at all (I think). Otherwise, you should make a virtualenv (the `venv` tool to do this is standard in py3, I think), which basically creates a minimal isolated python environment, which won't have the problematic pylint. You can then activate that environment, and `pip install --user conan`, which will allow you to *use* conan from your normal environment, but keep conan and its dependencies in its own isolated environment. In general, python projects should each be kept in their own virtualenv.
At the same microsecond? I think it's impossible
At least he’s using Python.
For me is: ctrl+c ctrl+c ctrl+c ?! Ahh... ctrl+d
TIL. 
I may give this a look! very interesting concept/ would also love to see the backbone for it to maybe see if I can use it for a FB! very cool!

&gt; Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. &gt; Although practicality beats purity. I would argue that treating exit as a special keyword _only_ in the REPL is both a special case and not practical. It already infuriates me that `_` has special meaning in the REPL when it's very commonly used for gettext stuff (although I wouldn't be surprised if the REPL's usage predates that).
Yeah, I’m not calling Python compiled because the reference implementation still uses a virtual machine to interpret the bytecode, right? I’m teaching myself a compilers course at the moment, and I’m having hard times drawing the line between compilers and interpreters:D There probably isn’t one, actually. 
You could, but that has some unexpected consequences, like exiting the shell on a call to globals()
Wait windows command line still doesn't do tab completion? I was under the impression with powershell and/or bash on windows, it was a usable environment.
The best reason to use ipython. Forget tab completion. 
My python console sessions are usually quite short, so I just spam up-arrow key until `exit()` shows up.
True that.
This one is the best.
Interesting resource. Thank you for sharing. Since it is basically processed from the filings in EDGAR quarterly, it is is highly delayed from what you could probably obtain yourself from EDGAR, however this would probably be great for backtesting. Especially so if you can extract the same data from EDGAR as here in real-time.
What do I do with this? Save to a .py file and then ...?
I [fix](https://github.com/benburrill/dotfiles/blob/master/common/.python-startup/snazzyexit.py) this with `sys.displayhook`. Unlike /u/dontworryimnotacop's fix, this doesn't require you to cripple `globals()`. I think I mostly just use `^D` nowadays, but thankfully now the times that I use `exit` are not particularly memorable. 
If you are about to ask a "how do I do this in python" question, please try r/learnpython, the Python discord, or the #python IRC channel on FreeNode. 
Yeah I believe usually it's updated at the end of every quarter. But because of the shutdown it hasn't been updated for q4 2018.
You could use a faster terminal. alacritty is a GPU accelerated terminal, https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty
Use ipython
It will probably be updated soon as I just heard the government shutdown will end for at least 3 weeks.
C-c is break, C-d is exit. And because C-d is exit, it's easy to remember that tmux and screen uses prefix+d for detach, because it's almost like exit.
Thanks. I'll look into this in the future.
meh :-/
I don't know what Power Shell has, but tab completion in cmd.exe is awful... Just awful. Whenever Microsoft copies something, it looks like they had only pictures to work with. Tab completion, virtual desktops, modern UI, system configuration,...
Powershell absolutely has tab completion. Even cmd has it, though just for things in the working directory.

Yeah I don't use my own globals hack anymore either, I just got used to `^D`in the end.
didja google something like "gas price api"?
make an alias for the gti command, no more typo ;)
Ok. Thank you! I apologize, I didn’t know about r/learnpython or the others. 
pssh, the real way to quit the python interpreter is as easy as: __import__("_sitebuiltins").Quitter(None, None)()
Didja read my post?

No one can tell you this because we don't know what you're trying to do. It depends on what type of programs you're trying to write.
I couldn't possibly be jaded if it hadn't happened to me, could I? So it happens, right? There are employers that get it, no doubt. But you don't wanna rush into your boss' office with this sort of thing if you aren't already in a development position without dipping your toe in the water first. Which is essentially the advice I gave. It is very common for some young rockstar who doesn't know it yet and hasn't worked for too long to do something awesome only to find that his superiors only see an opportunity to cut cost and increase the bottom line. There are a dozen stories of that just in this thread. Or the boss sees a young person who doesn't know his worth and takes advantage of that and piles them with work with no raise. Happens all the time too. A person has to protect themselves against these things, while embracing environments that aren't that way.
Would that make a difference here? The id should still be unique and constant for the lifetime of the object. Unless you are saying that Jython literally doesn't implement a usable id() function? The examples here just show that the object id that a variable is labelling has or hasn't changed. Id values can get re-used if the object is garbage collected so I would never rely on testing that they are a certain value to prove that an object is still alive, or something weird. But I don't see why this code wouldn't show the same logic in Jython from what you've said, it will just have different values for the id. Which would be the case when re-running the code anyway. The actual value doesn't matter, just that it changed or didn't due to new objects getting created and assigned.
I'm curious why they wanted the work done manually? Sounds like they took it as a big deal. Was it a government job (lol) or was it some contractual issue with a client? Were they just scared that a machine might screw up worse than a person?

If you're using it as a shell ... just use ipython where exit works.
You’re just not configuring your Ichimoku clouds correctly…
Just to add - all the ".somethingrc" files are hidden file that are always loaded whenever the "something" program is started. So "~/.bashrc" (home/.bashrc) is just a file of commands that will be called when you open bash. Likewise, anything you put in "~/.pythonrc" will be called when you load python.
We rely on a couple third party packages that aren't compatible yet. We'll move up to 3.7 as soon as we can. I really want to be able to use dataclasses.

`:x` will not write the file if there are no changes, whereas `:wq` will. This changes whether the file’s modified time updates. Not likely to matter in practice, but they are not equivalent commands.
First this kind of question should be ask there r/learnpython The quick answer is it's depend. What do the script? Also if it's not include in the script (using while loop or process) you can pause it. Also think about this, a pause mean that you have something that yield the informations already processed, it's not so simple. 
For `pwd` why not just use `os.getcwd()`? Is `os.path.abspath(‘.’)` faster/more accurate or something?
ok, I figured out how to fix this easily, it will be fixxed in ver. 2.0, or maybe even 1.5, which will just be a kinda demo, so thanks for the feedback, really apreciate it.
explain the help, copyright, credits, and license special case that you are told of when starting the REPL? If you don't want a special case then make it `help()`.
Personal preference, I like abspath because I never have to remember if it returns a relative path or full one.
Hello this kind of question should be posted here r/learnpython. And here is a good reference to read https://reproducible-science-curriculum.github.io/sharing-RR-Jupyter/01-sharing-github/ 
"You can log out any time you want, but you can never leaaaaveee!"
Ahh. FWIW I just checked and the [implementation of `abspath` uses](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/9a3ffc0492d1310ead9ce8f5ee678c26b20a338d/Lib/posixpath.py#L376,L385) `os.getcwd` to turn relative paths into absolute ones.
Haha i totally do that! I thought i was the only one!

So I'm working on building a beta list for our launch on Feb 1. Our software connects Google Dialogflow agents with a custom, rich web chat UI that puts you in control. (No mandatory facebook login, custom branding, rich media.) I've been sanding and buffing the edges on our website chat bot on DF using the Google Assistant response components because that's the only way Dialogflow can currently talk to Botcopy web chat. Wait, false. We also have a custom payload library for users to use to get around constraints of the Google Assistant responses. Obv GA wasn't made for rich web chat so there are instances custom payloads will be needed, e.g. adding more buttons to cards. But the responses are fine in most cases. So basically, my job is to get asses in seats on Feb 1 so I'm running a drip on Mailchimp explaining what to expect. Suffice to say, if you have a DFlow agent or the ability to set up a pre-built Dflow agent and come in and kick the tires on our branding and configuration portal it would be well appreciated. No ham and eggs for me this week. Becca 💪 website: [botcopy.com](https://botcopy.com) beta signup: [https://mailchi.mp/9a98878d99a5/botcopybeta](https://mailchi.mp/9a98878d99a5/botcopybeta)
I have a feeling they're probably just strings except help which is a function/class and you get it's repr which is a big ol block of text. The difference there is just typing in `license` shouldn't cause an effect other than the license information showing up, which would the same as if you had a variable `x` and just typed that into the interpreter. But the only one I've used is help so I don't know what it actually does off hand.
I mean, both approaches look for patterns. One approach uses the human mind, a thing built for finding patterns even when there are none, an error prone approach. The human mind is the thing that anthropomorphizes stars, a la astrology. The other approach uses real patterns that actually verifiably exist. A program with well defined criteria for what constitutes a pattern, what behavior to respond to said pattern, and reproducible results. So sure, they both look for patterns. That is about all they have in common. Palm readers look for patterns. Looking for patterns doesn't make them the same thing.
Try Julia if you want to be one of the cool kids. Matlab and R are very important (sadly). Python is probably a good place to start. 
This week I’ve been sequentially torturing myself trying to automate control over various analytic devices at work, with a capstone nightmare trying to read/write data to our laser control board. Our EEs wrote no documentation and initially only provided NCAT for us to use (the original written by Hobbit circa 1996).
Ctrl+d is the classic shell exit/logout shortcut, it's pretty universal.
The info generated is likely stored in a relational database somewhere. Can you query against that using SQL or other? Would use pyodbc to query and then automate the reporting.
Her first mistake was trying to install python on a toilet
I do a lot of kpi reporting with Python. My favorite is a weekly credit as % of sales report. Query against sales database to pull data, do some additional math, turn it into report workbooks, and then have it email to stakeholders on distribution list. The fact that I can use it as a wrapper of sorts to call my sql query, toss it into a dataframe to report, and email the report with attachments is really efficient. Call it from a .bat file with task scheduler and it's completely automated.

we are saying the same thing..... the repository linked is a simple example of quantitative analysis with the trade signals being the technical patterns....... regardless of how stupid or brilliant, simple or complex, the strategy is, you can define it in code and measure the performance.... &amp;#x200B; Buying Apple at 1:32 PM every day on a tuesday and selling it at 9:51 AM on the following thursday is a trade strategy...... it's also probably not a good idea on its own, but you can see how it performs. &amp;#x200B; I agree with you that I would never just blindly short a head and shoulders pattern regardless of market context...... but it is a statistically strong reversal signal in a bull market.. and you can quantitatively measure it to figure out how often it plays out, the average drop, etc.... &amp;#x200B; Imagine if you had other unrelated signals that you backtested that also had a bearish directional bias... that is at a very basic level how they build an edge.

Hi ncorbuk, just subbed. Keep it up buddy! Solid work. Take care.
Holy shit I’ve been using python almost ten years now and I never knew this
Yes! Ugh!
&amp;#x200B;
Thank you for taking the time to give an answer! I will definitely look more into CA - perhaps you can recommend further reading? Really enjoyed reading the book (finishing the last chapter now) - it had a good pacing (not too detailed, not skimming too much), you made subjects in the book easy to grasp. Thank you for writing this, and being so great in the Python community!
Julia?
Mind blown. 
what's the problem ?
Works everywhere
I'm honestly blown away that anyone uses the standard repl instead of immediately installing IPython. I can't function without tab complete.
dataclasses are the shit
Half the world is on 2.7 still.
I don't understand the difference between r/pythong and r/learnpython
The chart is fine, I'm just saying it's not called a histogram, it's called a bar chart. This dataset doesn't support a histogram. In a histogram, the categories that the bars represent would be numeric and in order. Typically it would display a distribution. 
Your probably using a python 2.x interpreter. In python 2.x "print" isn't a function. You just call `print "hello world"`. In python 3.x you run `print("hello world")`. To make python 2.7 forward compatible with print () you can include `from _future_ import print_function` near the top of your script. 
I will never stop habitually ":w"ing and I haven't used straight Vim in years.
Why? Doesn't sound like a proper solution
The repr is supposed to be valid Python syntax. But, as shown by u/HeWhoWritesCode, str can be any human readable representation.
&gt; Does this mean I should just delete this post? If you want to, but it doesn't really matter.
Dayum
They still have us use PIC 16F assembly in my university if it's any consolation! 
Building a fundamental supply/demand flow model for North American crude oil trading. Will be scraping and embedding info from government and proprietary sources and hopefully building some insightful visualizations and charts for trading idea generation.
Thanks! I really appreciate the feedback mate :)
Yep, it's ctrl+c (SINGINT) -&gt; ctrl+d (EOF) -&gt; ctrl+\ (SIGQUIT)
Because it's a real python object (a function). There's two "solutions" here, coding some special "magical" non-python command called exit, but that requires adding a hack to the python interpreter. The second option is to make it so that just "accessing" the `exit` object makes the interpreter stop, but that's very risky, as you could accidentally access it looping over `globals` or something.
Would calling `globals()` crash your interpreter? ;) Sounds very risky.
The amount of code people will write just to avoid having to call a function is amazing :)
Except when you hit it twice and terminate the terminal session...
Except when you hit it twice and terminate the terminal session... 
I believe it does.
Good bot.
It's more like ctrl+z.
What if you have a variable named exit and want to evaluate it?
What font is this?
Are you calling ipython hacky and unclean?
There are more Mexican immigrants \*\*\*leaving\*\*\* the US than entering it, are you sure about those numbers? &amp;#x200B; Regardless, even if that were a factor, it wouldn't explain why the portion of wealth held by business owners is growing, at the expense of employee wages.
So many hacks in this thread that ipython solved a long time ago
Or, you know, use ipython 
Ctrl-r ex [enter]
Indeed haha, definitely not for production hehe. I don't even use it myself these days, I just got used to Ctrl+D.
MY ANACONDA DON'T WANT NONE UNLESS YOU GOT () SON
As a novice just getting into trading can you elaborate? Do serious trading companies not use a massive amount of computing to calculate what to trade?
Ubuntu 16.04 is extremely common and ships python3.5 with back ported patches.
You can hack it to check the suspension frames and only exit if it's being printed directly by the interpreter REPL. Hacky obviously.
I mean... you \*could\* do: def __str__(self): self() But I guess that would be particularly egregious :P
You can't name a variable a keyword anyway. I guess I'm wondering why "exit" isn't a special keyword at least in the interpreter shell.
I guess in IPython it makes sense, as it already has magics and other extra stuff that isn't part of the core interpreter.
Perhaps see https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0322/ for background on `reversed`
There's a lot going on in this idea. As a first goalpost, I'd say that a single person who could do all of this should expect upwards of $130k / year.
It does more-or-less the same thing. `reversed` returns a iterator that iterates backwards over the sequence. `range` returns a lazy sequence rather than an iterator directly. The effective difference is that you can only iterate over the iterator returned by `reversed` once, but you can iterate over a `range` as many times as you like.
You may take a look its development branch [https://github.com/evhub/coconut/commits/develop](https://github.com/evhub/coconut/commits/develop) they are reasonably active. Also I did ask questions / raise problems on its issue page, and they did response promptly 👍
Obviously it depends on the terminal, but, Ctrl+D on a blank line is more accurately "I won't be giving you any more input." An interactive version of EOF. At any rate, it won't interrupt a running program like Ctrl+C does, it doesn't send a stop signal, it just lets the program know not to wait around for more input. 
Just use ipython as your interpreter instead.
NO. BAD.
You are looking for conda. It is not perfect, but it manages conflicts between packages and their dependency chains for you.
Why not just install Anaconda and not add it to your system's PATH?
Do you have access to ROS so that you can make it use another python env?
No, this is Patrick
Nice! Once you get a working version you should host it through version control so others can use it. One of my first projects with Python was an initiative tracker and I ended up losing the source code because I didn't use Git or the like. D&amp;D and other TTRPG programs are always fun. Good luck!
Came here to say this.
Same.
It's merged now and it will be in first alpha release
You'll gain respect from others as well. As a result, you'll be brought in for more important or tougher projects. Depending on the culture of the company, you'll be slightly safer from being laid off. It's never bad to be good at your job.

I have a question -- why do you need machine learning, exactly? Are these homes moving or something? Wouldn't they all look effectively the same? Wouldn't their coordinates stay the same? 
Until I swap to Windows and curse whoever decided to change it to Ctrl-Z.
Or Jupyter notebooks. I use Python every day, but what's the point of the terminal REPL? 
This is bootleg, but if your in Windows and your are running stuff in command prompt, select some of the text. 
&gt;Financial Statements and Notes Datasets Wow, thanks. This is cool. I wish older data is available in structured forms like this (for free).
Unfortunately it's not. The SEC only started requiring companies to submit there filings in XBRL in 2009. But there is plenty of government data available for free on data.gov. Currently it's unavailable due to the shutdown but should be back up soonish.

My favourite counter point to people that hold your view is: First we should eliminate excavators because we could have 6 people digging with shovels (5 extra jobs). Next we shall eliminate shovels because we can have 200 people digging with spoons (194 extra jobs). At the end of the day, blaming automation for problems with societal and political inefficiency is like treating the symptoms and not the disease. Worse still, these symptoms are very beneficial to us as a society. So while I agree with your message 100% without question, your solution is a terrible one. Every major societal change has had the same kind of doomsday preachers (when society became secular, religious authorities cried of the fall of morality. When gay/trans sexuality became mainstream, naysayers started talking about otherkin/pedophiles). There are going to be consequences to any change, societal inertia means many people are going to suffer, but we’ll adapt as we have with all other major changes. It’ll be just fine and for the better.
I dont know if I need ML, but definitely need image recognition, houses arent moving but they dont look the same either. 
The big question is how many hours would it take someone with that salary. 
Multithreading solution: main thread is that one with the script and the child checks for the hotkey it it's pressed the child sets a global sync variable to something the main thread is checking on every time the loop is done. It's not a real interrupt, I don't know how to make one, without looking it up(never needed one) except in c and assembly but you can import assembly into python.
I'm a teacher, and I've done some interesting work with student data. We have to be careful because if we mess up that data then students can end up taking the wrong classes, and people can end up not graduating on time. &amp;#x200B; That said, there is so much that can be done if you combine domain expertise and a bit of programming knowledge. You have to have enough domain expertise to know what you can work with and what you shouldn't touch, and enough programming knowledge to build something meaningful. &amp;#x200B; I ended up making a visualization of our transcript data, and we would have the official text-based transcript alongside the visual transcripts at student conferences. That saved hundreds of hours of staff, student, and parent time over the last couple years. It shifted the focus from trying to understand the textual data, to making plans based on that data. The information system we work with changed this year, breaking the visual transcripts because I was generating them from text output that changed. But the idea is cemented in people's understanding of how we can work with students in a better way, and we are working on a more stable version now. &amp;#x200B; I would encourage you to be mindful of the risk you're taking, but also to build something if you know it's going to make some processes cleaner and more actionable. This story repeats over and over in every industry. Good luck!
Python with the NumPy package is a good starting point. The other popular languages, matlab, R, and Julia, are all syntactically similar, meaning they look alike, and your knowledge will carry over a good amount if you try to move to one of these.
This is a classic case of: "If it knows what I meant, why doesn't it just do it?"
Ever written any code for a client? It's special cases all the way down once you hit version 2.0
You know what seems unclean? Parenthesis on my command line
C-z pauses and places the program into backgroun. You can access it again with fg -command
Yeah, but interactive Python shell uses it as a exit, just like many shells.
Yeah but they’re not using price information to make their predictions. Everyone has it so it is basically worthless. The real trading firms are hiring quants and buying more obscure data. A colleague of mine worked at a well known hegdge fund for a while. One strategy they employed was purchasing credit card purchase data and use it to predict who was going to have a big quarter. 
It uses it as "I am not going to type any more commands, so if you're waiting for one, just exit." Not exit in general. Try it out - Ctrl+D won't save you from an infinite loop. Only Ctrl+C does that. 
My standard python used to have tab completion, but I don't even know why. I suspected zsh initially, but one day the feature was gone although I didn't change or update zsh.
Same think he got, "cannot assign to operator"

That is a great explanation. Thank you so much!
Wow. The docs are very in depth. Thank you!
&gt; My python console sessions are usually quite short, so I just spam the up-arrow key until exit() shows up. I will literally sit there and press up thirty seven times to avoid having to type out ‘exit()’.
Just got downvoted for mentionning it. I have no idea where the hate comes from.
Yea, and tmux mod+d puts the session in the background and you can reattach to it, like fg, like I said
It's so handy! Now you can type &gt;&gt;&gt; vars(__builtins__) to exit the interpreter!
Do a `kill -9 -1` just to be sure. 
The boss just didn't trust that the automated way was as accurate. Turned out to be kind of a luddite, and I believe he was offended that I "took the easy way out"
He just didn't trust that the automated way was as accurate as the manual way.
`help` is already a callable, and `copyright`, `credits` and `license` are not special cases either, [just objects with a custom `__repr__`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/e42b705188271da108de42b55d9344642170aa2b/Lib/_sitebuiltins.py#L29-L85).

I mean, my general process goes: python "Shit!" quit "Bugger!" quit() ipython
A compiler is a program that translates from one language to another, where an interpreter (or virtual machine) executes a program. CPython contains both a compiler and an interpreter. Modern programming almost always involve at least one compiler and at least one interpreter, no matter the language. There isn't really a line between a "compiled" or "interpreted", but there is one between compilers and interpreters.
Why do you post this here?
I really hope it's worth the grief it caused. Quick question: Who can actually see themselves improve on existing code using this?
I honestly would prefer not to maintain my fork because of single quotes, but just not letting black fix quotes(your -S flag mention) is not a solution. Also, thanks. I confess that I didn't go through their issue tracker searching for this "feature" and I also didn't open a PR against black to trigger a discussion because I do not yet know if there's enough interest. If there is, maybe black developers will reconsider, if there is not, then I can still use black to my quoting style preference.
Why do you post this to /r/Python?
Thanks looks great
Thanks! I'll have a look.
I honestly would prefer not to maintain my fork because of single quotes, but just not letting black fix quotes(your -S) is not a solution. Black has some good points, I just prefer single quotes, maybe there's more like me out there.
I've started read "Automate the boring stuff with Python"
https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/8122/files
I, for one, can’t wait to convert all my `while 1`s. E.g., before: while 1: line = fh.readline() if not line: break # Do stuff with `line` After PEP572: while (line := fh.readline()): # Do stuff with `line` 
Damn, that's a great improvement for some of the most common functions / methods. 
&gt; I would argue that treating exit as a special keyword `exit` is not a special keyword. Where did you get that idea from? It is a plain old object, like any other object.
Try this `//td[contains(@class, 'CLS') and contains(@class, '96') and contains(@class, 'ptable-param')]`
I use ^w to delete words in bash all the time. Even when inside a proxmox Console. Thank god for ^T.
&gt; I can't function without tab complete. The standard Python REPL has had tab-completion available [since version 2.0 18+ years ago](https://docs.python.org/release/2.0/lib/module-rlcompleter.html). It's been automatically enabled for [more than six years](https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/d5ef330bac50).
&gt; Optional Integer NA Support Awesome
Don’t know any particular Python packages, but GNU Octave is frequently used as an open source alternative to MATLAB/Simulink for modelling feedback control circuits.
Not existing code, because that has to work with older versions. (Sometimes going back to Python 2.4, and oh boy is that fun... \s ) But I'll sure as hell be using it in new code that doesn't need to run in older version.
If you really want to do type checks, use `isinstance` - otherwise your function will fail on subclasses of `str` or `float`. Also, why does this function need to exist?
I'm using it in two or more places in my main module. But really at this point I'm just coding in order to learn, therefore I don't care much about making useful stuff. Your observation about isinstance is extremely smart. I changed the code to: &amp;#x200B; **assert** isinstance(unformatted\_time, float) **assert** isinstance(format\_template, str)
Wow that sounds awesome. I'd love to be able to contribute to the language myself one day.
&gt; for i in range(len(colors) - 1, -1, -1): &gt; print colors[i] No no no no. Just no. Even if `reversed` didn't exist (and since it does, it is the preferred way) you shouldn't do that. In older versions before `reversed` existed, you would write: for colour in colours[::-1]: print colour unless the `colours` list was especially big. It is cleaner and quicker to make a reversed copy of the list (you're only copying pointers so it is super-fast) than to get the length of the list, call `range` (or `xrange` would be better), iterate over the list, and extract the colours one at a time. &gt; The presenter explains earlier in the video that range() does not create a list in memory That's wrong in Python 2 (which you seem to be using. In Python 2, `range` creates a list, it is `xrange` which is the lazy sequence. In Python 3, the old eager `range` is gone and `xrange` is renamed `range`. 
Emphasis on "now" for the rest of us stuck with older versions.
I know "Sentiment Index" is a site that shows the general sentiment on a topic on twitter. Not sure if the dude who made it made a video or writeup how he did it but it might be worth checking it out.
Glad to know you are interested. You can always find more information about this at https://devguide.python.org . There is less amount of low hanging fruits since CPython exists for a long time but there is always room for improvement in docs, tooling, triaging etc. where contributions are welcome. I myself started with [typo fix](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/7691) as my first contribution. I wrote about the current problems I feel development is facing [in this post](https://discuss.python.org/t/howto-engage-python-contributors-in-the-long-term/771/2?u=xtreak) . Hope this improves as the steering council is elected. You can find easy issues triaged from time to time at https://bugs.python.org/issue?status=1&amp;@sort=-activity&amp;@columns=id%2Cactivity%2Ctitle%2Ccreator%2Cstatus&amp;@dispname=Easy%20issues&amp;@startwith=0&amp;@group=priority&amp;keywords=6&amp;@action=search&amp;@filter=&amp;@pagesize=50 This is a new one triaged as an easy doc fix https://bugs.python.org/issue5028 . CPython is highly understaffed and there 7000 open issues with 100 raised per week that needs to be triaged, fixed, reviewed etc. with very few people working on it full time. Thanks
Try this [awesome web](https://www.google.com) . Just type "python json" on the search bar.
Personally I think the official tutorial does a pretty good job. Pay attention to how Python is different/similar to languages you already know. Then you might want to spend some time figuring out how pip works and find the libraries you might want to use. This should get you started. Do bear in mind this is quite a lot to swallow in one night though…
Sentiment Analysis is one of the standard tasks in Natural Language Processing. In the most simple case we want to determine the polarity of a document, answering a question like is this a positive product review or a negative one. More advance applications also try to extract about what the sentiment is expressed (Are the people mad about our tech support or about the price of the ink of our printer). Also subjectivity/objectivity analysis is often considered to be a part of Sentiment Analysis. Here we try to detect wether a single sentence or a whole document expresses an opinion or wether it states facts. 
Is there ever a right time to mention the "Learn X in 24 hours" programming books?
You should raise TypeError instead or AssertionError.
Mostly it's just like, you can do the exact same thing with `datetime.fromtimestamp(ts).strftime(format)`. Why add another layer of abstraction where none is needed? 
Thank you. I’m going through that right now. 
Thank you for this. I was getting a bit discouraged, but this really helped me look past the immediate problem and focus on the results.
It’s not as hard as you think. The core devs are in too deep and don’t use things wrong, so they don’t hit those weird cases. Not every module is free from bad error messages.

This is the first step with positional arguments being made faster. Eventually I hope keyword arguments, optional arguments will be made more faster along with the changes being incorporated into argument parsing abstraction.
More libraries will be ending support by 2019 and 2020 https://python3statement.org . Latest pip release also emits a warning about EoL of Python 2.7 by 2020.
Anaconda does that. It’s sometimes overly strict, but it’s pretty good.
Well, that's neat, but as stated in the thread, no one should expect much speedup in real code. Python is still two orders of magnitude slower than C, and I don't see many improvements toward fixing that. That's would require deep internal changements on CPython. Some progess has been made, see [Modifying the Python object model](https://lwn.net/Articles/754163/), but these suggestions did not break through upstream. So, for better Python performances, I put now my hopes into numba. I love the simple `@njit` decorator. It is improving quickly, being now `pip`-installable, and [will soon support `dict` objects](https://github.com/numba/numba/issues/2096#issuecomment-449020435).
 import json with open("data.json", "r", encoding="utf-8") as fp: data = json.load(fp) print (data["foo"]) Please ask future questions of this nature on /r/learnpython
I doubt the goal of this was to catch up to C's speed, which is a completely unrealistic goal. This is a nice achievement and speed for free. Why are you so negative?
 __str__ = __call__
A bit off topic, but why is it still so (relatively) hard to append rows to an existing DataFrame?
This is great to hear! The faster Python gets the less interest I have in other solutions. 
No one with a decent programming knowledge would expect Python to compete with C or C++ on speed. That really makes no sense at all. What we would rather see is improvements that make Python more competitive with other scripting solutions. Honestly if you are using Python and speed relative to C is a problem you are using the wrong language. 
A Raspberry Pi Flask based Infra Red remote control for my Samsung TV linked to Google Assistant. I've managed to generate an almost identical signal using an oscilloscope to compare, but tonight I'll attach a IR led to the GPIO and try it for real :)
replace and strip are among the common functions that got faster and can deliver noticeable improvements in tighter loops like iterating over a large file. CPython is less likely to compete with C at least with the current model and free improvements are always good. I am happy alternate implementations exist like PyPy, numba etc when more performance is needed and the projects borrow ideas liberally from one another like some error message improvments were inspired by PyPy for 3.8, dict implementation in 3.6 from PyPy etc.
 &gt;This module is a work in progress. Not all functions are supported yet. The current list includes: &gt; &gt;[count](http://php.net/manual/en/function.count.php) &gt; &gt;PRs with more functions are welcome! :D
I don't have an answer that makes much sense. Actually, I was using datetime in the beginning; I just changed to not using it so that I experiment more with what's in \`import time\`. Also, the latest version of my function has additional useful functionality: def format_time(unformatted_time, format_template=LOGGING_TIME_FORMAT, filename_friendly=False) -&gt; str: """ Transforms time.time() or another float to human readable time. :param unformatted_time: time to be formatted, as given by time.time() :param format_template: template that will be used for formatting; example: '%Y.%m.%d %H:%M:%S' :param filename_friendly: make the output usable as part of a filename :return: unformatted_time formatted with the template format_template """ if not isinstance(unformatted_time, float): raise TypeError('"unformatted_time" must be an instance of "float"') if not isinstance(format_template, str): raise TypeError('"format_template" must be an instance of "str"') formatted_time = strftime(format_template, localtime(unformatted_time)) if filename_friendly: return formatted_time.replace(':', '.') return formatted_time
Like this, right? [https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/ak07cb/is\_this\_code\_pythonic\_format\_time\_function\_and/ef0e8fy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/ak07cb/is_this_code_pythonic_format_time_function_and/ef0e8fy/)
Fast you say? https://pypi.org/project/ujson/ 
Isn't this equivalent to \`for line in fh:\`? Arguably this type of \`while\` loop means that some way to iterate over an object is missing.
[Yes](https://recycledrobot.co.uk/words/?json)
Honestly, I still don't really see this as "useful functionality", considering this just modifies the format string, which you can also do by passing in a different format string.
I now realize that my sentence was confusing. I do not expect Python to be ever close to C regarding performances. I was talking about fixing the "two orders of magnitude slower", hopefully reducing it to one order of magnitude slower, as is Javascript relative to C.
I'm having a hard time understanding what this has to do with pybind11. Can you compile and run the following file? #include "my_example_interface.h" int main() { my_interface_func(1.0); return 0; } If that links then you should be able to compile and run the following: #include &lt;pybind11/pybind11.h&gt; #include "my_example_interface.h" namespace py = pybind11; using namespace pybind11::literals; PYBIND11_PLUGIN(wrap) { py::module m("wrap", "pybind example"); m.def("my_interface_func", &amp;my_interface_func, "An example interface function"); return m.ptr(); } If you can't compile the first one, then you have problems independent of pybind11. If you can, then the second should work. The setup you require for your setup.py is of course another issue. Maybe you should simplify things at first as a sanity check? I would recommend doing so by first compiling the functions you need into a shared library. I.e. take the headers and files and compile then as e.g. g++ -fPIC -shared -I[whatever] -o libstuff.so *.cpp Then you could just put the single include and your single wrapper file (without the extra includes) in the setup.py and put your lib in as well (might need something like `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD` or something). Does this help? If it doesn't you could always throw up a gist in github or something with what you want to compile. I.e. put everything you want there so that I can clone it and run `make` and then have execute what your best effort solution is. (In other words do all the work to make everything as explicit as possible.) Then I could clone and see if I could help out.
woo! thanks man! works great.
Can you please paste here or in pastebin you code snippet? 
I mean reducing the gap between Python and C, not catching C performances which is obviously impossible. I'm a little negative because I see [more](https://getstream.io/blog/switched-python-go/) and [more](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2017/01/grumpy-go-running-python.html) people moving away from Python because of performance reasons. And I don't see how to fix from CPython internals. That's why I think `numba` deserve many interest.
Pretty cool idea, did you paste your link to r/biology and r/labart also? If not you should
Isn't everything without pathlib EOL? And even for legacy python there's backports. No excuses.
&gt; while (line := fh.readline()): &gt; # Do stuff with `line` That's C code dressed up in Python syntax. The for loop as described by /u/666_666 is still the proper Pythonic way.
OpenImageIO comes to mind. 
You was talking about "significant boost in speed" which is a little misleading. The speedups are from micro-benchmarks. That's nice, but this it will not be as impressive as it looks like for real code. Sure CPython performances are improving, but actually it stay far from other "competitor" languages. And I'm not talking about C, I'm talking about scripting languages. How to fix that and prevent people to move away from Python because of performances? 
Every bit counts!
I wonder about the type of interesting insights you get from this type of question... Can you give some examples of insights from asking this question in /r/Haskell?

A lot of the performance benefits of numpy (and by extension pandas) stem from the fixed size nparray. Changing the size of that array involves copying the entire array to a new memory location. If one were to do that for every row, performance would be horrible.

*Feedback written with no ill intent, I appreciate your question. As with all code review feedback, this may come across as harsh (or not!)* I don't find type `assert`ing to be pythonic. It's better to fail if the wrong values are passed, or to go all-in on types in the function signature, like you are when you note the return value type `-&gt; str`. Also, you're mixing and matching your docstring comment style and type annotations. You're using the docstring to document the arguments and their types, and you're using type annotations to document the return value. I'd commit to one or the other. On the other hand, you're following the sphinx docstring formatting guidelines very well. Of course, there are situations where you need a human readable string describing an argument type in the comments as well as a type annotation. But that isn't the case here.
I was looking for this, thank you.

I left job and started learning Python/Django. I did two websites. Then I got depression and totally lack ideas of what to do. Money is tight, I don't know what to do.
Well, well, you’re totally right. It seems I’m carrying around some really old Python 2 code. It used to be the case that a construct like the following would result in a ValueError: fh = open('file.txt') for line in fh: line1 = line # ValueError: Mixing iteration and read methods would lose data line2 = fh.readline() And hence I’ve resorted to using while loops on files when pulling in multiple lines per iteration is required (not often). But it works without a problem now in Python 3. No one told me 😅
Putting the emphasis on the **M** of MVP and assuming a small (2/3 people) but experienced (in Python, but also in ML and Geo) my first guess would be 4 one-week sprints - sprint one: 'design sprint' agreeing/defining scope of the MVP, HL system design, UI/UX design, looking for suitable datasources, prior art, ... - sprint two: 'model training sprint' training the image recognition model - sprint three: 'back-end sprint' building the back-end that will handle user requests - sprint four: 'front-end sprint' building the user app So (rough guess) 4 weeks x 3 persons x 40 hours/person/week = 480 hours For training the model you might need some significant computing power, but for the final system/model serving your users what you need is mainly driven by the number of concurrent user request you need to handle... (I've seen image recognition apps processing a single 24fps stream in real-time running on nothing more than a single raspberry pi) 
Sure, but why not at least give me an "insert buffer"? It always feels clunky to add rows.
Vim + Neomake + some other plugins as an editor. TeamCity for CI (wouldn't use it if it wasn't our corporate standard) 
With bitcoin, all transactions are public on the blockchain forever. There is no privacy to that system. 
I think that was an argument against making it a keyword, which is essentially what the top-level comment was proposing.
I have used `exit` in years. I just do `ctrl-d` (or, more often, `ctrl-dd`).
Having an insert buffer would still more than double the overhead. All operations would need to be performed on two buffers instead of one, and the second buffer would be a sparse buffer, which would require even more overhead. Instead of worsening the standard use case, they require you to think ahead. If your use case prohibits thinking ahead, an `.append(pd.from_records([row]))` shouldn't be too hard to add.
Tbh, I may have never used range() without checking in a console. The first parameter being inclusive and the second parameter being exclusive has never failed to trip me up.
Me too 😂
The PEP lists out a few rationales with before/after. The only one I find particularly compelling is list comprehensions where: results = [(x, y, x/y) for x in input_data if (y := f(x)) &gt; 0] you're forced to either recompute the value a number of times, or switch the whole syntactical construct you're using and revert to a traditional `for` loop. &amp;#x200B; fwiw, i think this would have been much less contentious if they used \`as\`. Apparently they confined its unparenthesized in a number of logical places so its mostly only useful in \`if\`/\`while\`/comprehensions that i can think of
Install everything as a normal user. Give that user only the rights it needs to read and execute the files it needs. Why would you want to install something globally ?
&gt; TeamCity for CI (wouldn’t use it if it wasn’t our corporate standard Really? I love TeamCity. What don’t you like about it?
I've followed the discussion on python-dev, and I was not convinced by the examples then. Also, your sample problem is typically "fixed" with nested comprehensions, but using a lambda or admitting the computation borders what's reasonable for a comprehension, and moving it to a function would also make more sense to me. 
I asked this question in /r/learnpython and got no responses, because I'm asking an advanced python question.

The way I remember it is - range(num) returns an iterable with length equal to num. So, len(1) == (0, ), len((0, )) == 1
I've been a professional software engineer for ~25 years. Among my set of tools is python and I've been using that for all/most new development for a couple years now. Editor: pure textmode emacs code assist: what is? CI/CD: `git merge`, basically. I try to make my software small and simple enough that I don't have to "deploy" anything. Or if I do, it's just a `cp` or similar. 
Or 3 times to close with background tasks...
Linux, xfce4-terminal, Vim, ALE, flake8, neocomplete, Git - even for deployment and CI - using post-update hooks in test repos that run CI tests before pushing into production repos.

My use case is often the following (and I know it's an edge case, but still): I have a dump of several GB of XML data and need to read all of that and then filter some of the columns/rows and at the end I output some aggregates (avg, sum..). Most of it is ad-hoc. Nothing _too_ special. Since I need to extract each row on it's own from the dump, I more or less _have_ to insert single rows. Of course I could batch-append, but the real problem for me is, that I need to put relatively much effort into doing that. It's a first world problem, without any question, but each time I encounter it I get a bit frustrated that such an easy operation is so annoyingly implemented.
exit() is a function, just like print() is.
Well, may be it works well on not so big companies, but almost every action takes very long when there is thousands of projects. UI just freezes on every search. Plus poor integration with GitHub. Sometimes it takes 20min for TeamCity to notice a new commit.

I work for a small company that uses it and I use it in my own personal projects. I could see where it might slow down if you have lots of stuff. Thanks for the clarification!
This is a unix/linux question, and what you are describing is a standard way of doing things. Give applications their own sandbox and only the permissions they need to do their job.
&gt; houses arent moving but they dont look the same either Have you seen the average suburb? If you thought those cookie-cutter housing developments looked identical from the street... There could be some interesting applications if you widened the field to larger than a single house, but then again anything taking the images that needs this info would have GPS built in anyway. So I'm still wondering what the intended application is. 
This post belongs in /r/learnpython. Additionally, you should use something other than an image to share code when you are asking a question.
#Fucking sweet, integer NaN's!
Ehh. I don't know. Maybe the standard distributions turn it off for some reason? Redhat and Ubuntu packages across all Python versions I've used don't do tab autocomplete.
The entire lifecycle is a hell of a lot more than just the CI pipeline. I use vim, but most of our developers use PyCharm when doing Python (there are also people using sublime, atom, etc.).

Because you should use something other than pandas for that. If you don't already have the full dataset or at least know it's dimensions, you should be working with another tool. And pandas makes it ridiculously easy to import data, so there's no downside even if you need pandas to work with the full dataset. Put down the hammer and pick up a screwdriver.

You're going to have to be _a lot_ more specific. Do you have an example library in mind?

No, your point is a straw man argument that OP never made. Yes automation is a good thing, but it's not that simple. There are consequences, one of which is that there aren't enough people that recognize the reality that automation sometimes displaces people that cannot reenter the work force for various reasons. Between the general populace and the 1% we don't have enough agreement that the rate at which we introduce universal basic income should match the rate at which we displace people that cannot be employed to their same level of employment before being automated away. 
Yes I do, https://ulauncher.io
