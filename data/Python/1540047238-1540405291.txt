About how many LOC/SLOC is this project?
Umm... Reddit?
TIL. I had never thought about what Reddit was coded in.
I just checked. It's 2,599 Loc.

Python is the way to go for your use case. I believe you can do this without Python but just your database. 
Made my first PR to the trio library related to some SSL behaviuor. This protocol is a complex beast, but pretty interesting to smash your head into the wall until it works properly :)
dropbox
You could too ;)
That it is not respected doesn't mean it shouldn't be. Familiarity improves understanding at a glance. Why should i pay the cost of inceased cognitive load because you cant be bothered? Also if you can't pay attention to conventions why should I trust that your code doesn't cut corners in business logic too? Java people would murder you for not following the camel case convention which is 99% code in the wild and it's not because they can't read otherwise. The only pep8 rule that sucks is the one about line length, especially now, with mypy annotations popping up all over the place.
He did that in the above comment thread
Woah, that's way less than I expected!
Any plans to release on switch?
Awesome! Good work
Literally the best and smoothest looking game posted on here. Congratulations to you sir
I have no clue how to go about doing that. &gt;.&gt;
Nah, I am too lazy for that.
I put 100 hours into it from mid August to mid September. Then I had to wait another 30 days to put it on Steam (it has some weird rules).
\- Read about PEP8 and try to stick to it as much as possible. \- Read the first chapter (More if you want, but the first one is highly recommended, if you have a little more time read the first four chapters) of Clean Code by Robert C. Martin (A free PDF: [http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780132350884/samplepages/9780132350884.pdf](http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780132350884/samplepages/9780132350884.pdf)). It will greatly improve your coding in general. The book uses Java but it applies to Python as well. &amp;#x200B; Aside from that it of course depends on what you wish to achieve, but you asked for tips about general knowledge in coding and Python so that's what I can recommend, feel free to ask if you need something more specific.
You may want to look into the numbers because indie gaming is really strong on switch right now
There are freelancing opportunities in Python, for sure. Every day work automation is typically done in python and there is a demand for that. I‚Äôm not sure how your living situation will affect your ability to get customers, but there are customers out there that can pay you well. The hard part is convincing them first that you‚Äôre there guy.
I did not know that that is very interesting
The yum/dnf package manager (used in RHEL/CentOS/Fedora) is written in Python.
Facebook and twitter I think you can still easily get the number of followers, but Instagram api you can't. I would use requests, rather than urllib, and I'm not sure what you're using regex for but if you're using it to parse html that's a bad idea, and not necessary if you're using the api, rather than scraping the site. 
Am I the only one who felt kind of nauseus watching this because the motion is kind of janky?
When you were 12? How old are you now?
Good article. I agree with most of what you said but, could you please just take the time to run the code you post to make sure it actually works. One of the function names had a space where a _ should of been, meaning it won‚Äôt run, meaning you didn‚Äôt test code before you shared it...
accept I have a list of strings not just a very long string, and re.sub only works on strings
That‚Äôs the mathematical definition, which he does violate... gosh man, guys using words he doesn‚Äôt actually know

Not related to python, but did you do your game design and sounds ? 
Fucking beast man, wtf.... 
When I get home I will buy your game. Congrats man, I really appreciate this kind of proyects.
The design started as a joke, but then I turned it into a game around a month later. The sounds are a mix of things recorded irl (modified with audacity) and things made with SFXR. I used Bosca Ceoil and Audacity for the soundtrack. I used MS Paint for most of the artwork and a [tool I made](https://dafluffypotato.github.io/pxeditor) for animations. Level design was done by another script I wrote. It's in the game's files, so it's actually usable if you have Python + Pygame installed. (`level_editor.py` under `data`)
So much quadratic 
Yeah I'd definitely buy this on switch. 
In case of numpy however, the numpy loop is usually written in native c which means the loop will execute a lot faster. Usually referred to as a vectorized operation.
Your comment value was a string type and not a list type, but if it were a list type you could use the re.findall on the iterator value of the list comp. basically moving findall and the int cast around.
How are the sales so far?

The one time you actually want lazy developers! 
There have been 160 sales since the initial release.
Thank you very much (: So, I can't send strings there? What a disappointment.. I wanted something that would return True for 1234a for instance, and False for 12345.
$20/hr? Do you know what software developers earn?
What is PyWeek
I would first try to get it working with a terminal program (such as miniterm which is written in python) to make sure you've got the correct baud rate, parity, handshaking etc.., then you can implement it in code. What platform are you using (Windows?)
Hello, I'm also learning django and have a question, where/how are you enforcing User level permissions? For example, how do you prevent UserA from deleting UserB data? Sorry in advance if it is obvious... 
Thanks for mentioning PEP-8. I've been wanting to find something like this!
Make a game (typically with pygame) in one week. The voting for Theme is done. We find out the official Theme in 7 hours, then you have a week to develop a game. I am hoping for 'Spheres' as I have a decent simple game idea in my head. It's like that 'write a book in November' challenge, but obviously better because PYTHON. https://pyweek.org
Yes. Not everyone lives where you do.
AFAIK ‚Äúlocal time‚Äù refers to the time zone set in settings.py in most of those explanations. 
Yes, absolutely. Look into [scipy.stats](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html).
&gt;math.isnan(x) &gt; Check if the float x is a NaN (not a number). For more information on NaNs, see the IEEE 754 standards. The function `isnan` expects a float. The `input` function does not produce a float - it produces a string. And the reference to IEEE 754 above is not trivial - NaN is a special floating point value that has more in common with Positive Infinity than it does with letters. Read the first paragraph of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN, and realize NaN is not the concept you want. 
I would like to know too. 
The servers for instagram, pinterest, reddit, quora, youtube and dropbox are all majority python, I think. Facebook and Google aren't majority python but they still use it a lot.
how does that work for moving through diagonal gaps?
PEP8? üòâ
Out of curiosity, what is memory pigging? Also with respect to the display limits, those are pretty configurable (using `pd.set_option`). But yea, in general displaying the data is not pandas strong suit, considering its mostly limited to a terminal or IPython cell. What would be alternatives for displaying the data?
I'm not sure what you mean by diagonal gaps, but diagonal movement still works once both the x and y axes are applied.
Thanks, I'll look into this!
No.
Thank you for this recommendation. I'll look into using a longest-distance path-finding approach. 
Thank You very much! 
What happens if there is a collision along the x axis, but diagonally there is nothing in the way? It looks like this method would still count a collision even though the path is clear.
Possibly my favorite issue is https://bugs.python.org/issue34087 since a 2-3 tickets were created due to Django apps segfaulting 3.7 . List of good segfaults were fixed : 
Studies have shown snake_case to be more readable. For example: ‚ÄúuseIambic‚Äù vs ‚Äúuse_iambic‚Äù. Contrived example, but the underscores make for easier reading. 
Python gets used for scripting for a lot of servers, it's a variant for the P in LAMP stack. It was also used in some games like Civ 4, Sims 4, and Overwatch. Loads of web stuff and scripting inside of programs, and a bunch of science/math/numerical analysis type of uses.
I love it. Classic yet new. Beautiful work.

Amazing
* A REST API with Flask that loads and saves the data to SQLite. * A companion GUI app for the previous REST API. * Web scraper that saves the data in a clean way, you can try scraping all the simpsons episodes from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Simpsons_episodes) * Get some time series data from crypto currencies and generate some graphs with matplotlib.
/r/learnpython Also, what do you expect to happen, and why? In lines 7 and 8, you append the input to both lists, whatever it is. Point out the line you think should prevent that. The last 4 lines of the function don't do anything, because you're just doing an assignment to a variable you don't use again. Also, multi-word variables should be in `snake_case`, not `camelCase`.
Not really liking the fact that no function returns anything. What would be the benefit of having a mutable Response object instead of just \`return\`ing something valid?
I have been freelancing for 11yrs now and here are my thoughts. 1. Your location is not an issue, i am from South Africa. 2. At 3USD per hour, you are selling yourself short. Most of those who are new to freelancing have this erroneous idea that they need to charge lower fees in order to be competitive and get gigs especially on platforms like Upwork. At that rate, you'll burn out, you'll waste your time and it'll show in the quality of your work. In no time that low rate will start working against you. 3. You don't need a few years of experience to start freelancing. An area like web scraping has a lot of gigs even on platforms like Upwork and this is a skill that you can master in about 2 months and get ready for basic gigs on web scraping. 4. After getting down the basics of python, the areas that you need to get into that are easy wins and have immediate opportunities for freelancers are; web scraping, web development using a web framework (flask or Django), basic scripting to automate tasks and working with APIs. There also seems to be an increase in clients looking to have bots developed, so that is something you can also get into, i am only mentioning it as an addition because unlike the others it will take more time to ramp up the required skills, the same applies to gigs on data analysis though a good knowledge of the Pandas library combined with web scraping is a winning combination. &amp;#x200B;
These really look exciting. Thanks. I am looking forward to working on some of these.
What would you recommend to someone who wants to create a game like this but has no knowledge of pygame? Is there anything you found out yourself the hard way that other people don't mention?
Congratulations, bruh.
Give a proper example of the list of strings please, as what's in your original post has bad syntax for a Python string.
Hello, I've made several presentations on some popular Python topics in our local Python meetup. These are all available in my github repo for you to peruse. Please excuse the large memes, as these we presented for a live audience. Have fun :D

If you want people to follow the link, adding a comment that goes a bit more in depth than what's in the subject, could work wonders. If you add a reason why we need your solution to the domain would be even better. 
I don't regret much when it comes to game development. There really wasn't anything major I learned the hard way. There are plenty of good beginner Pygame tutorials on the internet, but that's about all there is. For the more advanced stuff, you kinda have to figure it out yourself. It's fun in its own way. Making games is probably the best way to improve and I doubt there are any shortcuts around that. :P
Wow, that's a nice looking Web UI! How did you design this (and what tools did you use to design this)? Just pure CSS? &amp;#x200B; What's the use case for this project?
You got the digitize part right, great! The indexing part can be greatly simplified with the following ideas: First, you can digitize a complete n-dimensional array (in your case the 2d array of the image). This gives you a new array of the same dimensions with the digitized indices. Second, if your character map is also a numpy array, it can be indexed by any other numpy array (of any dimension).
yes it's just javascript/html/css over a websocket connection to get the playback info from the python backend. the mpv server accepts a protocol which is basically just json with a bunch of arguments, they thankfully have very good documentation. the use case is that I have a raspberry pi and a desktop pc hooked up to the TV in my house and I wanted to be able to just control the player from anywhere in the house. 
I've heard that they have a lot of [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) on the server side
This sounds interesting, how often do they do these challenges? 
If u wanna be a web developer for a while stick with javascript but if u want job security stick with python and Oracle I used to code back in my college days it helped pay off the loans 
This is really mora a question for /r/postgresql. Newer Postgres versions do handle JSNO data pretty good. If however you find that you need to massage it into proper shape using Python, please ask in /r/learnpython . 
I've found 32 files with `.py` extension in [gimp sources](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp). 8 in `tools` folder, 23 in `plug-ins`, 1 in `build/windows`. So one may say that GIMP is pure C.
Zipfs Law is well explained in a Vsauce video, but to summarise, it is that the second most used word in a text is used 1/2 as much as the first most, then the third most used word 1/3 as much as the most, etc. This phenomenon occurs in every language and pattern. My program graphs the frequency of use for each word on the y axis against the arbitrary x interval. The x axis is arranged so that every point is a unique word in the text, and they are ordered from left to right in order of their frequency of use in the text.
I'm trying to learn OpenCV, then make a Raspberry Pi thing that turns sign language into written text
[Kivy](https://kivy.org/#home)
Hat's off, looks very well structured. This is a perfect milestone for me, I just started myself. Python is such a clean, readable dev language, it's amazing. &amp;#x200B;
Somewhat on the back burner, but I‚Äôm starting to make a desktop app to manage world of warcraft addons. I‚Äôm still not positive how viable it will be for wide spread use due to how cross platform stuff can be a bit obnoxious with python. Backend stuff is all fleshed out. I have to learn GUI stuff from the ground up, which is why I‚Äôm doing this project.
You played with my feelings, I thought this was free software based on title! **Cries in RMS**
It says only windows and linux for me.
https://store.steampowered.com/app/951360/Super_Potato_Bruh/ That should explain it pretty well. :P It's basically what happens when you mix Super Meat Boy with a bullet hell.
I have other games with free source code (all written in Python &amp; Pygame): https://cmlsc.itch.io/
No. It is not worth it just for interviews. &amp;#x200B; The vast majority of coding jobs, and the easiest ones to get, expect you to know one or two languages, frameworks, and tech stacks very well. Few employers are looking for "good coders in general," they are looking for "someone who knows how to use React with MongoDB" or "someone who knows how to use Django and AWS Lambda". (This is not, in my opinion, the best way to do things, but it's how most hiring is done.) &amp;#x200B; If you are good at JS, dig in and get better. Learn Node really well. Learn React. Look for JS jobs (there are SOOOOO MANY). Learn Python if want to learn Python for your own interests, or if you have to learn Python for a specific project, or if you are particularly interested in a Python-dominated discipline (like data science). But don't learn Python just so you can be a better interviewer.
Yep! I didn't outsource anything. :D
It's a graphics library for Python. It lets you render stuff onto a window.
Nice one! I study CS &amp; I sometimes chat to the games developers, I know how hard doing a project like this could be, really impressed!

fucking piece of shit, it said steamOS, not MacOS.... fuck me in the ass.... doesn't matter tho, i have a virtual machine... but fuck me....
&gt;itch.io already bought it on steam man, make it aviable to macOS, just for me, don't let me die... &lt; / 3 my hearth 
Try r/learnpython; also, would be nice if you posted the code directly and not a picture of it here (just copy paste it here, leave a line above it blank and indent every line of code with 4 leading spaces) :/
The packaging software for Python projects has a bug that makes it incompatible with Super Potato Bruh. ._. I think there's some stuff you can do in the terminal to fix the issue on the user's end, but at the moment, I don't think it's possible to ship it working.
I love this so hard! It's amazing! 
I doubt there will be any support in the near future either. ;-;
Ok thanks
Thanks! Would you mind leaving a review on Steam? I don't have any at the moment. xD
DW i will support your work anyway, congrats on the game bro, hope you make some more. i will just be waiting for the macOS support
Downvoted for posting a phone pic of your screen. Do you edit your code with Photoshop? Code is text, not images.
Very impressive.
Oh ok sorry haven't had enough beer today. Gotta wind up you know.
just bought it and am having fun but could you add 1920x1080 to the resolutions, i know its all in pixel art but i dont like to play in a small box or have it blurry in full screen at a non-native res
Changing the resolution before selecting "fullscreen" changes how things are scaled. I think that 1200x750 looks the best fullscreened to 1080p, but 1600x1000 scaled to fullscreen also looks pretty good. Neither are perfect, but 1200x750 is only the tiniest bit blurry. If I remember, I'll add a native 1080p option to the next update. :P

Nice, I'll have to check it out. I've only used Amazon's pertained algorithm which has worked really well for me. Can't comment on that package, however, a lot of the time well maintained open sourced packages outperform enterprise. But it's definitely possible to offload a face detection algorithm. 
I like turtle.
My guess is that you are missing python on your windows PATH. Because you CMD is telling you that it can not find an executable named Python. If your python, windows path and enviroment is correctly set, python --version should do the trick
You need to have the python.exe path in your PATH environment variable 
Awesome, helped my issue thanks a bunch.
I don't see how they are interchangable; only one language has pre-install status on browsers, so it depends on whether you are working on web apps or not.

If you're working with tasks that require several gigs or more of ram, 64bit (makes no difference in writing the code, just in running it). 3.6 included some nice optimizations in dictionary speed. I don't remember exactly which version enabled f strings, but I think it was after 3.4.
regarding 64bit vs 32bit it depends on what you do. Similar to why you installed a 32bit or 64bit OS. For regular users, I recommend 64bit -- i don't see the advantage of using 32bit legacy software unless there's a particular edge case. Regarding Python versions. There's usually no reason not to use the latest one and most libraries are kept up to date with python releases
If I'm understanding your problem correctly -- your logic is a bit off, instead of an \`elif\` you should just have an \`else\` (the animal type IS in \`classDict\`. Then, you need another set of ifs to see if the \`species\` is in the \`aType\` dictionary. If it is, \`that species += num\`, else, add a new key to the \`aType\` dictionary and set the value to the num. The \`count\` var is unnecessary. &amp;#x200B; \`\`\` def zoo\_keeper(aList): #notgood classDict={} for aType,species,num in aList: if aType not in classDict: #check if class doesn't exists speciesDict={} speciesDict\[species\]=num #If class doesn't exist create a new Species Dictonary. classDict\[aType\] = speciesDict else: if species in classDict\[aType\]: classDict\[aType\]\[species\] += num else: classDict\[aType\]\[species\] = num return classDict aList =\[('mammal', 'doge', 4), ('reptile', 'python', 37), ('bird','chicken nugget', 8), ('mammal', 'clifford', 2), ('reptile', 'python',3), ('bird', 'eagle', 1), ('mammal', 'harambe', 0)\] zoo\_population2 = zoo\_keeper(aList) print(zoo\_population2) \`\`\` With that, the output is: \`\`\`\` {'mammal': {'harambe': 0, 'doge': 4, 'clifford': 2}, 'reptile': {'python': 40}, 'bird': {'eagle': 1, 'chicken nugget': 8}} \`\`\`\`
I'm re-creating the risk models used at my institution in order to circumvent the lag time of sending our data out to a company who then send it back with the risk models applied. They provide us every piece of data required to run the models ourselves. No one at my institution has implemented it, however. I have no idea what I'm doing, but here goes. Should be a bunch of matching different CSVs and a few calculations and spitting out a new CSV.

f strings seem to be implemented with 3.6 so it will not be tought in the book. i think the book teaches ".format" instead of "%" to format a string, is the new f string optional or will 3.7.1 not work with the format version the book teaches?
Yes if you're training on a trivial dataset like mnist and only have like 2 layers tops. Anything more significant will take you a very long time. 
the default download for windows on the [python.org](https://python.org) page seems to link a 32bit version. the guide that recommended 32 bit version mentioned compatibility issues with nltk (Natural language toolkit?) i don't know wether or not a beginner will use that one. since jos\_metadi mentioned it doesn't make a difference in writing code is installing both 32 and 64 bit a option and just run in 32 bit if i run into compatibility issues?
That's pretty bad ass, show more examples!
It's a list comprehension. It takes all the key/value pairs from mode.items, check if the value is max value, if it is it includes the corresponding key in the list being created. A simpler example is below, the expression can also have conditionals in it. my_list = [ num for num in range(10) if num &gt;= 3 ] It's just a really compact way of making a list.
Nice peoject. Though do yourself a favour and learn to use git and github/gitlab. It'll help you in larger projects, especially when collaborating, and is just generally a good skill to have. 
This is true, but if you use something like Google Colaboratory, you can run code for free on google's servers, which should be more than enough for someone learning. 
How is it packaged? Are you using something like cx\_Freeze or PyInstaller?
I love it! Next step is to add [kitty](https://www.gothicat.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1-meow-div-150dpi.jpg) mode. 
Those are good suggestions and more or less exactly what I got into about a year ago and it gave me the biggest boost in my coding journey so far. I had gotten a bit more comfortable at writing some simple python scripts and at the time I wanted some 'real data' to play around with so I looked up some tutorials on how to use praw to pull data from reddit (much easier than it sounds/looks at first). It's a good introduction to the concept of using APIs if you've never done it before. Making some scripts using praw was fun and good practice and I decided I'd try making a GUI for some of those scripts. I got something working with kivy and was pleased, but then realized I could hit a bunch of birds with one stone by building a web-based GUI instead, or in other words building a web app with python on the backend. I went with Vue.js as the frontend framework, to dip my feet into some proper modern web dev stuff while still continuing to write logic in python. I realized I can write backend scripts in python which collect/process/store data (I use psycopg2 for postgresql to store data) and then serve them with flask to Vue as json. Then I looked into chartjs to turn some of that data into decent looking graphs for some more practice. While I did all that I got used to using git which was huge as well. Just figured I'd write out some of my journey as I found myself in the same spot where I kept going over basics but had a hard time putting things into practice and needed something to take things to the next level. Depending on where your skillset is at, a lot of it might sound like too much, but trust me it just sounds that way or looks that way if you look at it all at once, but if you take it piece by piece, all these libraries and stuff are not difficult to get into. 
Thanks. I may have been just looking for this post. It really sounds great. I have started learning git and also started on my first project. Thanks a lot
It's useful to break up list comprehension in order to get a better understanding of how they work. max_keys = [] for key, value in mode.items(): if value == max_value: max_keys.append(key)
Isn't the point of list comprehensions to... well, write them in just one line?
Do you know how long it'll take to go through the whole thing and create the final game in it?
&gt;Additional Notes: Super Potato Bruh doesn't use most GPUs, so your GPU could literally be a potato. Nice.
Oh that's strange, didn't expect they were still linking to the 32bit by default. I've been using 64bit exclusively for like ~8 years and can assure you it's just working fine, and I think it's what probably 95% of people out there use :) Also, I am using NLTK now and then and haven't had any issues with that. I would honestly just go with 64 bit and if you should encounter issues (which I don't think you will), then you can still install 32bit Python.
No, the point is to take advantage of a concise and efficient syntax. Most times, creating a list (or iterator) with a comprehension is significantly faster that if it was written out over multiple statements. Even written over multiple lines the compression is still just a single statement. And, most importantly, readability counts. I find that more people can quickly and easily discern multi line compressions in code bases they are unfamiliar with. Just like writing good comments and inline documentation, producing highly readable code is an excellent skill to tout as you ascend as a programmer. 
I think f strings was like a year ago, so should be 3.6. 3.4 is already ancient in the Python 3 world, and I think some libraries even dropped support for 3.3 and 3.4
I have no clue, but I got through most of it in a weekend.
Python turtle is my favorite for now. 
I guess that's because conda is way behind pip ecosystem for reproducible environments. I've investigated how good it's for this task and found three problems/issues: https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/misc/issues/4
These are pretty good, have you posted a link to this in r/learnpython? I bet they would appreciate it.
I *DO* use conda for all my environments and updates, and I still got this problem. so it is.
32 bit python makes python a toy. i've run problems requiring 60 GB of RAM. Yes, you can be more efficient, and my code optionally is these days, but 10 GB in 2018 is not a lot.
i had no idea you could index like that. numpy is great huh &amp;#x200B; `GRAY_CHARS = np.array([' ', '.', ':', '|', '+', '=', '3', '#', '@']) # length must be power of 2 + 1` `BOUNDS = list(range(0, 2**8, 2**8 // (len(GRAY_CHARS) - 1)))` &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; `def make_text_from_image(input_img_filename, pixel_scale):` `return GRAY_CHARS[` `np.digitize(np.array(`[`Image.open`](https://Image.open)`(input_img_filename).convert(mode='L')), BOUNDS)[::pixel_scale, ::pixel_scale]` `]`

I highly recommend posting your question there. Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster. Show /r/learnpython the code you have tried and describe where you are stuck. **[Be sure to format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F)** and include which version of python and what OS you are using. *** ^(this bot is written and managed by /u/IAmKindOfCreative) ^(This bot is currently under development and experiencing changes to improve its usefulness)
Whilst I've always written them on a single line and prefer that conciseness, your formatting is so much easier to read. It would actually be a great way to explain it whilst learning. A lot of people see list comprehension for the first time and get totally lost even when it's vaguely explained and the operation is self evident. Your formatting makes it super simple to understand. It could be a good first step in the explanation process. 
If you're using Django post on the Django subreddit. Whilst I do backend web dev, I don't take contracts over the Internet, but maybe somebody in the Django subreddit may. If it's just cgi scripts maybe share one or two and we can see if you are using some fundamentally broken patterns. Regardless of what it is you're doing, if you're accessing a database then I can almost guarantee that your database queries are the problem. Poor queries usually kill performance and ORMs whilst making using databases easy often let's people perform very poor queries. Also, if you're returning static content then it's best to serve it via say nginx, and using a CDN can also help a lot. Is your server in a remote location? If you're on the East Coast of the USA and your server in Singapore then just the time it takes for the signal to travel to Singapore and back can be substantial. See what I mean? We need to know a lot more about your setup to help you. 
Ok.

#OK.
&gt; I know what it is doing I don't - you don't have a docstring for your function
You are partially right as application also needs: * virtual environment configuration, * sometimes it also needs locking all the particular versions of packages together with hashes.
Generally if installing python libraries isn't a problem I think people recommend installing and using requests library over directly using urllib (requests has a much nicer API) https://gist.github.com/kennethreitz/973705
how did you make it into an exe? 
Will buy! Looks amazing. Good job OP

Sure yeah! I learnt more about APIs through Discord's API because Discord isn't as complicated as Reddit. You could do the same, but it's ultimately up to you. Reddit's API Tutorial: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5us049/heres_a_tutorial_i_made_on_creating_a_reddit_bot/?utm_source=reddit-android Discord's API Tutorial: https://www.devdungeon.com/content/make-discord-bot-python The most important thing is to work in your free time and **do not** restrict yourself to the tutorials. Tutorials only teach you so much. You have to work by yourself by reading the documentation and figuring out which methods (functions) to use and how to use them. All the best on your journey!
Thank you so much!!!! I might take you up on messaging you. It's good to connect with others that have already been through what I'm about to go through. I appreciate it!!
Can you elaborate? I personally like the fact that the code don't need change even if the number of output of a given function intresse after an update. you would need to change the code to _, feame, _ = cap. read() if suddenly cap.read() outputs 3 values while cap.read()[1] will stay valid
I used cx_freeze for Windows and pyinstaller for Linux.

Do you want SQL injection? Because that's how you get SQL injection. First off %s is Python 2 Syntax, the python 3 way is `"ABC{}". format("D")` and secondly using format strings with sql asks for SQL injection. There should be a method to format safely (sqlite3 for example has `cursor.execute("select ? from table", (attribute,))`)

Imo the oneliner is way more readable. It reads just like an english sentence.
Have a looked at the MultiIndex docs: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/advanced.html
Anaconda is nothing more than a software management system. Frankly I was not real impressed with what shipped with MS Windows early this year. Eventually I gave up on Windows to go completely to Linux. On Linux the native package manager, dnf in this case works fine for my approach to Python (light programming and scripting). As such I have zero desire to waste time on Anaconda.
You can assign a (lambda) function to the node attribute and then call it whenever you need it.
What platforms would you recommend?
Don't bother trying to use Python for mobile app development. It's a lousy experience all round. 
Amazing work!
If you don't mind throwing down a few additional bucks. #1 Buy the source from itch.io #2 install python + pygame #3 run the game from the source
How so?
Or f-strings. a = 123 print(f"the value of a is {a}") 
Didn't know these, neat, thanks! But still they can be utilized in an attack
'values' must be an iterable for cur.execute to be able to use it
it will come with warnings if they plan on removing it. I think the from time import Clock Gives of a warning that it will be removed in future versions if I recall correctly (writing this from the phone). However why not use f-strings they are awesome! a = 123 print("the value of a is {a}") # prints "the value of a is 123 
Alright, so here's my problem. I can't code. I'm doing this for a math degree, and he wants us to submit this project in Python but hasn't given us anything in the way of lectures, tutes, lab work, exercises anything. Everything you just said, it honestly means nothing to me. But thank you, it gives me something to google. All I have so far is a graph, I have an adjacency matrix that shows how each of the nodes connects to each other. But I dont know how I use it to assign a function to each of the nodes :( That's why I'm asking how I create the vector for all the nodes ... or do I just need to assign a variable = adjacency matrix ?
Ok no prob I can help you if you give a little more info on the network you are using. From what it seems it is similar to an Ising (like) model but the states of the nodes are continuous on the range -1, 1? Similar to like an artificial neural net?
Is he just saying that I define x=(x_1, x_2, x_3 ... x_N) and then use that in a function that points back to x and my adjacency matrix? Is there a way I can create that from the matrix I already have ... because I am planning a 21x21 matrix, and I really don't feel like manually typing out x=(x_1 ,..., x_441). 
Wait, I‚Äôm also learning python and am a big gamer. Discord bots use python?
You are mixing up two seperate operations. 1. Data loading 2. Data (multi) indexing. You need to load the data as full rows, and then after that apply the index so you get the hierarchical index on team. 
More like awesomepythonbutonlyML
Yeah, pretty much. Here's the question: https://imgur.com/a/dOKFg2A We need to see how the network develops depending on how strongly the nodes are coupled (C), and how much noise is in the system (D). But I'm not too worried about the equation at the moment, I just need to figure out how I assign any equation to the nodes. I have some code from an earlier question that varies the coupling strength, and I'm working on the one for noise. But for now I just need to assign any equation to the nodes. Until I know how to do that I'm stuck. 
&gt; ex s For your specific example you need to do the following; ``` import pandas as pd raw_data = {'Team': ['A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'C', 'C'], 'Year': [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, ], 'Win_Per': [90, 85, 93, 91, 86, 94] } df = pd.DataFrame(raw_data, columns=['Team', 'Year', 'Win_Per']) df = df.set_index(['Team', 'Year']) df ```
I would reccomending working your way through the tutorials found here as a starter; [https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/tutorials.html](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/tutorials.html)
I think you need to be a bit more specific about your problem.
Implement code while learning and not just watch tutorials. Practice on website like hackerank and codeforces.
aside learning from one consistent source? according to the book the .format was already implemented in 2.7, so if i'd ever have to work with 2.7 thats one thing i wouldn't have to worry about.
There are multiple libraries in multiple languages to choose from! I'm using discord.py: Https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py It's been an amazing learning experience!
Yeah, thanks @Eclipsetech , but to do it in real time, ML-Tensorflow, would take few more seconds delay, I have seen Google Translate like [this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.translate&amp;hl=en), so can I do same for handwriting characters in no-time, using api or library?
Start making your own programs asap. While you constantly learn more, go back to your programs and rewrite them better.
I couldn't get you.
I mean...you don't have to pay for it, so all you're losing is some HDD space.
Where did the phone chip come from? I thought that's what was preventing this from being invented before now.

I am working on \`OpenCV with Python\`, from sentdex-tutorials. I will be working on my personal [project](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/9iskom/have_anyone_made_paper_keyboard_in_opencvpython/). 
Not worth it, use PyPA tools
`pip freeze` to display the packages installled. And you should *never* be using `sudo pip`. Ever! Learn what virtualenvs are
If you come from a language like C take the time to learn things like list comprehensions, zip, filter, sets, dictionaries and so forth. Use them everywhere you can until you start to get a sense for how to balance them with the more familiar constructs. Never Ever do things like: &amp;#x200B; `for i in range(len(numlist)):` `print(numlist[i])` &amp;#x200B;
Follow PEP8. Honestly, that's about it. Python was fairly easy to pick up...
I'm using them as pre-commit hooks. Where the commit fails if it's not passing the tests. 
The biggest thing for me was ability to give non-python people a script and have it work right away on their system if I tell them to setup Anaconda. 1 install and I knew they had a bunch of libraries right away.
Downvoting because the question is too vague to answer. 
Nice, I had not encountered that before. Is that just acomplished by calling the constructor with `index=['Team','Game']` Thanks
I have always used CSV files as intermediates to SAS, and then a SAS import script. If your data are rectangular, that‚Äôs probably the easiest solution. On the other hand, I have also taken advantage of saving R DataFrame binary files using Rpy2, so I see why you would want the direct conversion. I think this is not possible, because sas7bdat files are binary encoded and proprietary. 
Sorry if this is a stupid question. I'm still pretty new to programming in general, but how do you do that?
Extremely convenient if you don't have the patience of waiting for numpy, scipy etc. to install on your slow network :)
So I'm in a 100 level class, and this is how we are taught to go through a list. Can you tell me why it's bad, and the right way to do it?
I think it would be as simple as just displaying the work in the answer. &amp;#x200B; not sure how you have it setup most basic calculators use some sort of if statements to determine the answer. When you print the answer just include the other information. Print (numA) + " + " (numB) + " = " (Answer)
Opet kraƒëa open-sourcea, sramota
It's only 2G though, so if you want to try it, be sure you have 2G coverage. Some service providers are shutting down their 2G networks. I was just reading about Piphone and Zerophone using Raspberry Pi Zero. There was mention of SIM53x0 which I think could use 4G, but I'm not sure where to get this.
I am not that much of an expert myself but in Python, for loops behave like for each loops in other languages. What this means is that instead of telling the loop to run x amount of times, you can loop through each element independently, which makes it a lot more readable. Suppose you had a list of numbers from 0-9 numlist = range(9) for number in numlist: print(number) The loop will individually iterate through each element, so 0, 1, 2, etc.. and print this element. You do not need to reference the current index of the number in the list every time. I think this was what the original commenter was getting at. Feel free to correct.
There are always a dozen ways to skin a cat in pandas, so here's one version df = pandas.DataFrame({"A": [.9,.91], "B": [.85, .86], "C": [.93, .94]}, index=[1,2]) df.unstack()
This is the sort of thing a C (and maybe C++ or Java, but I'm not as experienced with those) programmer would instinctively do. In C arrays of data are analogues of the way data are stored in the CPU. At the CPU level you have to use an index register (number) that points to each element of the array in turn. The common use of "for" loops in C mimics this. Python has a more abstract view of collections and iterating over them is a much more natural process. So a better way of coding the example loop in Python would be: for i in numlist: print(i)
I'd say a quick explanation on mutability in general would have come in handy. When the hell was I to explain that to younger-me?
If you're using git, there should already be some examples in $YOUR_REPO/.git/hooks. Strip the .sample from the filename and if the exit code of your script is not zero, the commit is aborted. Then you can fix it and prevent committing noobish typos. An example is: https://github.com/cbrueffer/pep8-git-hook

As soon I got got just past being a beginner, I would tell my past self it was okay to ignore Python 3 until right about version 3.3, but then it‚Äôs time to get moving. It‚Äôs now almost 2019 and Python 2 EOL is a year away (https://pythonclock.org). The `six` library and these future imports make it pretty easy to transition, so stop fussing and do it already: ``` from __future__ import print_function from __future__ import unicode_literals from __future__ import division from __future__ absolute_import ```
Imo for newer programmers reference vs value is a more tricky concept in a language that is pretty straight forward whereas people who come from C++ for example should understand that concept already pretty well
Hmm, this is not about reference vs value (although I see why you make that parallel), it's about mutability vs non-mutability. Everything is passed by reference in Python.
Everything is passed by reference in Python? I'm sorry but I don't think that's true. Mutable objects are passed by reference while immutable are passed by value by default as far as I understand
Do you have a brain?
Not really your just stupid
Idk how I can be
See, it's not that simple. ```python &gt;&gt;&gt; def dummy(a): ... print(id(a)) ... &gt;&gt;&gt; b=3 &gt;&gt;&gt; id(b) 140595027448864 &gt;&gt;&gt; dummy(b) 140595027448864 &gt;&gt;&gt; ```
Every expert was once a novice. Don't beat yourself up for not knowing something - everyone who learns it needs to go through the same process. 
The indentation in your code is messed up so it's difficult to read, however I understand what you're trying to say. If you call for the address it will give you the same. However the variable is not mutable which is a predefined definition of a reference. A reference variable is a variable that can be changed within a function and the change will be reflected in the called. Python does not work that way for immutable variables. For example: def func(a): a = 3 a = 1 func(a) print(a) So saying that Python "Always passes by reference" is definitely misleading.
We can't help you because you haven't given us anything to work with. When you're asking a question, you need to show your current code, as well as what you've tried for your problem, so that people know where you're coming from and can give you beneficial tips; it also helps to ask an actual question (e.g. by using a question mark in your post), to do so on the right subreddit, and to not call people stupid in the process.
I‚Äôm not sure if ‚Äúyou‚Äù means me specifically or the general ‚Äúyou‚Äù, but after 12 years of Python experience, yup - lining all the way. VSCode didn‚Äôt exist when I started, but man does it make things easy.
Well, if you have such a strict definition of passing by reference, you can't say Python passes mutable value by references either: ```python &gt;&gt;&gt; def dummy(a): ... a = a + [0] ... return a ... &gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3] &gt;&gt;&gt; dummy(a) [1, 2, 3, 0] &gt;&gt;&gt; a [1, 2, 3] ``` So either you say Python passes everything by reference, which is technically true, and refer to mutability to explain some behavior. Or you say that Python passes nothing by reference, which is technically wrong, and you still need mutability to explain some behaviors.
Author of Py4J here! The project is not dead: I just released 0.10.8 this morning. Pyspark uses Py4J under the hood so it is definitely an appropriate solution to bridge Python and Java. 
Ok now I see you don't know what you're talking about. Again I cannot see your code. To display code on reddit you must add 4 spaces before each line of code. Literally the parent comment that you commented to is saying the same thing I'm saying. You're saying Python doesn't pass mutable value by reference either. Well that's just plain not true buddy so you gotta go study some before teaching people on reddit. So go try this code on your ide: def func(a): a.append(1) a = [] func(a) print(a) Just like I said, the change can be seen in the caller, therefore it was passed by reference. In the previous comment it's the exact same code, however the difference is that it's not a list (mutable object), it's an integer (immutable object). Also, I do not have "such a strict definition of passing by reference". That is literally the definition that is used in every single language I've learned, C++, Java, Swift, you name it. I have never seen passing by reference not being used with this definition.
If you're good with virtualenv you don't need anaconda. Convince me otherwise
I don't know if it can be done simpler pd.DataFrame( data=dict(win_per=[90, 91, 85, 86, 93, 94]), index=pd.MultiIndex.from_product([['A', 'B', 'C'], [1, 2]], names=['team', 'year']) ) 
That's pretty shitty, honestly. You're trying to sell a product that you _know_ will become completely unusable for its stated purpose in barely a year for more than half the world.
I‚Äôm from Latin America, here your game is a tad more expensive. But the real problem is, wtf man.... what the fuck is this, super meat boy meets my depression, fucking piece of shit.... be ready for my fucking review, OMG.... loved the game tho.... great work 
Looks like pipenv/poetry do the same thing as pip-tools + some convenience automation to deal with environments. So there should be a comparison pipenv vs pip-tools.
Hey, thank you for your reply. Let me get some things straight: 1) we're trying to educate people and that's our main goal 2) 2G will be available in most countires for at least 2 years 3) It won't be "dead" in "half of the world" after that 4) We are working on an LTE upgrade that we'll try to offer to the users on a later date 5) All 2G feature phones that are or were on the market were/are doing the same thing Have a great day!
I can see my code just fine, maybe you ought to use a decent browser. I'm saying exactly the contrary to what you think I'm saying, I'm saying Python passes everything by reference, and that your example above to argue that integer are passed by value could be used to say lists are also passed by value (just change `a=3` and `a=1` by `a=[3]` and `a=[1]`) and show you don't know what the concept of mutability entails.

Hi, Try to set encoding on top of your script: \#-\*- coding: utf-8 -\*- Also check those " ". &amp;#x200B;
and to add to the argumentation that talking about passing by value or reference has no interesting meaning with Python, see [the official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#how-do-i-write-a-function-with-output-parameters-call-by-reference).
Smart quotes (sometimes called curly quotes) nailed you in your doc comment. Add this to the top of all your python 2 files: \`# -\*- coding: utf-8 -\*-\`. See here for more info in PEP-263: [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/)

Python 3 is meant to be used, the shebang indicates it. What's happened is that PyCharm defaults to the default system python interpreter, which in this case is python 2. Assuming you've got python 3 installed, you just need to tell PyCharm to use it. See https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/configuring-python-interpreter.html for more info

Oh my god, this. Frustration with dicts makes me actively avoid them now. 
Hahaha.. did you even read what you just sent me? It's literally saying the exact same thing I just said. If it's an integer and you want it to be "referenced" meaning you want the change to be reflected in the caller than you should return a tuple of the values. (That's the first box) If you want to change a dictionary (mutable) object than than you can simply change it and you don't have to return anything, the change will be reflected in the caller.(second box) Of course if you do a = [3] it will create a new variable bc that's how Python treats namespaces but the definition of reference remains the same, the ability to change a variable within a function and for that change to be reflected in the caller without needing to return it and reassign it. You can clearly see that ability in the difference between the first and second box and even reinforced later. Not only that they're demonstrating the difference in using a mutable vs immutable objects in the context of a reference and showing how the changes reflects the caller which demonstrates they're using reference in the same definition that everyone else uses. I'm sorry but it's clear you're missing some basic concepts of object oriented programming so I'll leave it as this and allow you to learn on your own.
A curated list of machine learning related to python 
Unfortunately this is what it has come to now. I realise we have a lot to benefit as community by having python as the major programming language for ML, but goddamn is it an annoying buzzword.
Learn to read and understand documentations. Start by reading up the topics you are learning in python docs. It will come in handy when you have to use external libraries, which is very often. Don't keep relearning the basics, which is what most courses or books teach you. You don't have to remember *every* list and string and other methods and built in functions. Most beginner courses cover the essentials. As a continuation to the previous one, after finishing a good beginner courses, start learning some useful libraries that help you interact with the os,files and the web. I would suggest ( re)gex,os,requests, beautifulsoup or Scrappy, time,datetime and json. Then move on to others based on your interests or requirements. Finally, write reusable code. Import your previous written codes in your new programs. Learn this early on.
I strongly prefer the list comprehension in your example. In what scenario should I consider map?
You could argue that conda is the standard package manager for python on Windows.
I am not an expert, but googling for "python IF-97" led me to https://pypi.org/project/iapws/ Does it look like what you are looking for?..
I meant in general. The problem isn't limited to python, try using C++ on windows some time. Super frustrating.
&gt; We are working on an LTE upgrade that we'll try to offer to the users on a later date How would that work? The existing chip is surface mounted, is it not?
Yes, but the whole GSM module is plugged in the main PCB. We're working on an interchangeable socket that could allow you to swap the GSM board for another one
To echo another comment, use conda on Windows. For any popular package it will *just work*
I don't think `mysql` is an actively maintained project -- if you dig around, it looks like the corresponding repo hasn't been updated in at least 4 years. If you run into issues building and installing some particular package on Windows, it's worth checking and seeing if it's available on the [unofficial Python binaries](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) page. In this case, it looks like the `mysql` library *is* on that page -- but it recommends you use the (actually actively maintained and Python 3 compatible) `mysqlclient` fork instead. Really, this page should be unnecessary and these libraries should be building and distributing the wheels themselves, but not all libraries have their infrastructure figured out yet.
cool now i can build the most aggravating robocaller the world has ever seen
I also tried installing mysqlclient, its just the same error.
Dealing with third party packages requires at least a little effort for any language. In this case, as /u/michael0x2a pointed out, this package hasn't been maintained in 4 years. I would be quite surprised if it still worked. As a general, language independent rule, you don't want to use unmaintained libraries - even if they do work, you'll likely have trouble down the line. I would maybe look at `mysqlclient` which looks to be a well maintained fork of the package you're trying to install (I found it by checking what Django supports).
Yeahhh... It can't really do robo calls but it's really great if you want to get into coding and electronics :)
Woah, this looks perfect! I'll give this a try for sure! Thanks!
Definitely not the point, no. Some common python formatters explicitly break them up. Simple ones are fine on one line, but if you have a complex method call in the middle or a conditional on the end you should break it out into multiple lines for readability. 
3.7 is actually the first 3.x version that‚Äôs explicitly as fast or faster than 2.7 for almost all operations. Dataclasses are nice, too.
That may have been true a few years ago.
Yeah, windows is the culprit, get on a Unix system. I code in Mac and Linux, almost no issues in Linux, a handful in Mac, but when I‚Äôve tried my hand at windows the sky falls.
Very much so. I‚Äôd look into the SQLAlchemy library if you‚Äôre looking for an ORM.
Now, just to be sure, I use copy.deepcopy(). Works like a charm. How can you not use them? What do you use instead?
You raise fair points to this naive example the OP presented. I think adding a little complexity to the example, as you mentioned, would improve things. Perhaps you could provide a better minimal example on Github? 
Windows sucks for programming

How programmable is the phone functionality? For example, could I add a button to send incoming telemarketing calls to an on-phone version of Lenny?

This is really cool! Just want to add that I've bought the exact same USB-powered soldering iron. It's really cheep, but it's very good quality and so easy to use! One of my best purchases from China.
I‚Äôd love to see a unified, cross-platform (at least on the big three) C++ compiler/package manager enforced by the standard ala Rust‚Äôs cargo. I seriously feel like the reason C++ devs get paid a high salary is just to deal with the ridiculous build process. A man can dream.

If you're using Python 3.6 or higher you can use f-string string formatting. ``` if name == "Jim": print(f"Your name is not {name}.") ``` Otherwise you can use regular string formatting: ``` if name == "Jim": print("Your name is not {}.".format(name)) ``` Also, you need to ask questions like this in /r/learnpython
It's been a while since I set it up but I think it was only available as Linux version via anaconda and even there the install didn't work. I just looked at it again and it seems like it's been updated, may give it a shot again and report back
Yeah, when cross compiling for Windows is easier than compiling on Windows, there's something wrong. &amp;#x200B; I wish I got paid for doing my C++ dev work. I do it voluntarily... for fun. Maybe I should see a psychiatrist. &amp;#x200B; Oh well, at least it landed me an internship this summer.
I mostly do some quick data analysis in Jupyter Lab, so I try to use namedtuples to replace dicts to some extent.
Not only applying to Python: Don't just complete tutorials. Stop being scared and think of something yourself. Take snippets of tutorials explaining how to do certain parts. Or if you start out with tutorials. Expand them after finishing.
Does the Arduino have a python interpreter on it? Or can you compile the python code down to Arduino machine code and statically link it in a way that supports the appropriate memory accesses? 
We are aware of FCC's rules and the final version of MAKERphone will be FCC compliant. The one showcased in the campaign is a proof of concept device showcasing the basic functionalities that has to be adjusted for mass producing and commercial retail (that is the point of Kickstarter). This is not a scam and I do not like the tone in which your talking about our campaign. We are a small team of 7 people trying to spread positive influence, not scam people. Our small startup already had a Kickstarter campaign that was successfully funded and fulfilled and we do not plan to break that habit this time. Have a great day!
Look up Micropython. I believe Arduino foundation does make a board compatible with it, but the standard Arduino doesn‚Äôt have enough RAM to run even micropython.
Thanks. I use it and like it. 
Along with that I‚Äôd like to know if it will have a programmable sockets interface for using the cellular internet
I do not dislike you and I never said that. I just dislike the way you're talking about our campaign. The question was not inconvenient and we're not hiding anything.
&gt; The question was not inconvenient and we're not hiding anything. Sure.
That's a valid argument, thank you for that :) Have a great day! If you find our campaign interesting, please share it with your friends and help us make MAKERphone happen :D
Yeah, they're pretty good :) I was amazed with the quality too when I was getting the samples. You just need to plug it in a USB charger strong enough (2A), that's why we include one in our tools pack. Cheers! 
Why can't it do robo calls?
Cool, thanks. Though from other comments the 2G limitation is a dealbreaker for me.

This looks like bug, also from the comment you provided looks like Pipenv uses pip-tools internally so it also is affected.
\&gt;&gt; often I forget all I've learned by the time I return to complete a chapter This is my major frustration with learning languages in general. If you don't use them you forget the details. That's why I started this python-notes thing because I need something to revise years later that what exactly and how I learned it before so that I don't keep wasting all my life going over the basics again and again from the scratch.
So relatable. 
Seems like it. But one of my learning targets is to understand where exactly in CPython this behavior is happening. I am trying to understand CPython source code ( from talks like this : [Stepping through CPython](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGF3Qu4dUqk) ) so that I can make out what exactly causes these sort of intricacies.
&gt; Walk away from the computer for 30 min and come back to my work done. Boss: We're really slammed today. Try to keep your distractions to a minimum so we can get it all done today. Me: OK. Let me get a cup of Joe first. &lt;starts script, &lt;walks to kitchen for coffee, comes back, Sips coffee before looking busy&gt; Boss: You working on it? Me: yes. At this pace I should be done before we leave &lt;script had finished 4 sips ago&gt;
This. As a beginner,I thought of a tuple as sort of a frozen list, often wondering, why would I need that? It's not. It's a collection of data in fields corresponding to their location. Though in Python, accessing data by index feels awful to me....namedtuple to the rescue!!!
imho it is much more clear (and de-facto standard in python and other langs): I read it and know exactly how many values are returned by the function, and which are the relevant ones in the scope of what I am reading. I don't really get your point, if the library/api devs care that little about backward-compatibility they might as well change the *order* in the output, no?
It has been almost a half year since I switched to Linux and Even longer since I gave up on Anaconda on Windows. The version of Anaconda used came with the system, that is MS develops tools. In any event there where many issues with installing or updating software including Anaconda itself. In the end getting totally pissed off with Windows, for many unrelated reasons, drove me to deleting Windows and installing Fedora. Fedora has been pretty good with only a couple of lingering bugs. In any event the Fedoras repos provide everything I need for my admittedly limited development needs. It should also be noted that I spent just under 10 years running MacOS with HomeBrew when it came out. Maybe that exposure to the UNIX/LINUX world has biased my expectations but in the end I couldnt stomach Windows. I realize that this doesn‚Äôt provide specific information to help you but I don‚Äôt want to offer up misinformation as a result of poor memory. It should be noted that somebody on a forum did suggest that I should have installed Anaconda from its home web site to get the official version. I never tried that as Windows 10 had many other issues that needed resolving. Basically I switched to Linux the minute it was stable enough on the new chip set. 
OK cheers for the feedback, we're also very proud of Anaconda on Linux of course, but if your needs are met by fedora's system packages already then that's great.
Sorry about that. Should I delete my post ?
I have not tried that package, but if that is a proper implementation of IAPWS-95 and the IF-97 variant then this is exactly what this person needs. Good job finding it!
Seems like its not just the beta... button text not appearing only on Mojave at the moment
Since when is CX\_Freeze windows only? &amp;#x200B; From the docs: \&gt; **cx\_Freeze** is a set of scripts and modules for freezing Python scripts into executables in much the same way that [py2exe](http://www.py2exe.org/) and [py2app](http://svn.pythonmac.org/py2app/py2app/trunk/doc/index.html) do. Unlike these two tools, cx\_Freeze is cross platform and should work on any platform that Python itself works on
1. [instance method vs class method vs static method](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/python-instance-static-class-methods/) 2. Every object that is iterable would have to implement the filter/map functions. You can't make it available by default since not every object can be iterated over. filter and map take any iterable, and do their respective operations. 3. // c++ if(condition) do_something(); do_some_more(); The `do_some_more()` is outside the if block, which can be trippy. Not so with python. 4. Agree
I assume by ‚Äúwe‚Äù it means you work for Anaconda (or whatever the parent is called). Anyway, do you do the that profile guided optimization too? Either way, I love Ana/Miniconda. Makes it so easy and, as someone who does lots of scientific stuff, it‚Äôs nice to not have to wonder much about having the packages. 
Windows is not the culprit. They're not even involved in python. Python is at fault for not bundling a C compiler.
Published the first bugfix release of my feed aggregator library; I realized the CLI command to serve the web app was broken in the initial release. It was pretty motivating to see how much stuff I had to add in the [changelog](https://github.com/lemon24/reader/blob/master/CHANGES.rst#version-011) for the few commits I've done this month.
1. but those are defined with decorators. The most common types - instance methods (and in fact class) must have a self so why not make it implicit? The only argument for why its done this way is so that another self can be passed in when calling (duck typing) which really is a very minor use case and I'm sure can be done another way. 2. could this not be addressed by using dunder functions for __map__ etc? Just like an iterator must have a __next__. 3. But that's standard python and can be done for lambda's as well, so why not?
Your responses don't seem genuine at all man
In javascript, the meaning of *this* can at times be extremely confusing. Explicit *self* as first argument removes this ambiguity. &amp;#x200B; Lambdas are talked about a great deal, but I think I have written... three in about 50,000 lines of python.
Hmm. I write lambdas all the time in JS. Also anyone who calls themselves a JS programmer should know how this works - same for any other language, e.g. knowing what self is. It doesn't remove any ambiguity since there's no reason to use it in the first place as its mandatory (ie redundant) for methods, and if the method is static/class then it has a decorator, which again makes self pointless.

I've been juggling C, Python and Processing for the last 2 years. Absolutely love programming at first it was a scary mess of symbols and words and numbers but god damn I love it now 
I had the same start but is gets more fun as you progress. Is C worth learning? 
I may be a bit late but i hope that ok. A week ago One of my friends asked me this same question and I answered "Make a bot, any kind of bot" and now he has created a bot for a dating site that automatically scrapes the website for new females and auto-friends them. Needless to say I regret telling him that but whats done is done. So, create a bot, any kind of bot for anything you want (although I do not recommend doing the same as him), If the bot returns any kind of data (such as a web scraper) make it save the data in a database (I recommend SQLite) and create a way to access that data (such as a API, GUI, etc...) and if that project is a real kicker, maybe you could sell it
Yeahhhh I've noticed the more things I discover about a language the more I can do and I love that! C is not that hard if you know processing other wise the syntax can be a pain but I've not used it for more than a few mess around projects and syntax practise for processing! If you can find a use I'd say it is! Head Start C is a great book if you have the time and money 
I used to recommend Anaconda for Windows as it was insanely worth it a year or two ago. Nowadays though I find it more or less unnecessary and more of a hindrance due to the progress made by the Python core (with cooperation from Microsoft), at least for my usage pattern (as an experienced developer who wants to run his mostly command line scripts from VSCode with minimal hassle while using numpy and choice parts of scipy). Basically, today I can download the latest official Python distribution, run `pip install numpy scipy networkx` and it just works. Thanks to Anaconda I didn't have to install Visual Studio Whatever Free Version (but that matches the version that Python was compiled with) (4-8 Gb download by the way), then make sure to use the VS command prompt every time or patch PATH to include vcvars32 (or vcvars64?) and remember to run it, also manually download `easy_install.py` in order to install `pip`, all that bullshit that distracts me from what I want to do: programming. And Anaconda was a total godsend, thank you guys! But today I don't have to do that with the official distribution anyway. So I don't know what to tell you man, it looks like you filled an ecological niche of making Python package management less terrible but now that niche has disappeared from under your feet because Python built-in package management has become good enough. I can enumerate some pain points (some might be 3+ months outdated) that made Anaconda actually worse than the official distribution for me, and not an alternative option that I could keep using because why not: * It's hard to find the miniconda download link on your website. Silly, I know, but still bothersome. * You lag behind the official distribution significantly, like weeks, maybe a month. On this year's ICFPContest we used Python3.6, so Anaconda was right out. * Continuing that theme, "oh yeah, there's this conda-forge thing and other alternative channels that I can use", 6 hours spent doing the shit that pimple-covered linux fanboys use as a substitute for actual programming, still didn't work. I hate, hate, hate being sucked into that, precisely because I'm susceptible to that. * You don't integrate with the `py` launcher. Official Python does. I don't want to edit registry settings manually, that's not programming, I hate that. * Launching Anaconda Python somehow adds about 2-3 seconds to the startup time, when launched from VSCode, because it imports a lot of stuff. On a _fast_ SSD. Every freaking time I run my stupid simple script that prints 0.9\*\*9 or some other throwaway thing. Official Python doesn't do that. The annoyance adds up over time. * When I get sucked into using alternative channels and trying to fix the stuff myself, I inevitably hit the fundamental by-design wall: your repositories don't contain the build scripts themselves. WHY. Like how am I even supposed to contribute if building stuff by hand involves hunting for random github repositories that usually don't exist at all? Why don't you have source packages that binary packages are built from? Mind boggles.

If your first reflex is to do `sudo pip install`, there is no software that is going to save you because you don't understand how you're misusing the system, and you'll just misuse this theoretical "antivirus/malicious package db".
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
Neat! Thanks!
&gt; How can I periodically save my DataFrame during the iteration process ? ...and deal with re-do logic, disk full logic, power fail disk syncing, ... are you sure you would'nt rather use a database?
I agree about the complexities of this in JS but that's because its much more flexible. In the first code snippet, I'm not confused by what self is, since its idiomatic. I mean, you could use any name like peanuts.a = 1 instead of self and it's still work, but self is standard, so why have to define it? And in fact if you don't you get an immediate error anyway.
&gt; where a multiline lambda wouldn't be reused (in which case you can start a named function anywhere you want) yes there are cases where you only need a function for that case. And having to define it elsewhere means its not visible at the point where its used - its like defining vars at the top of a function like in C.

What are your plans for this? Can you share a detailed plan that shows how how your supporters backing is going to get you from point A to point B? I design electronics for a living and deal with these regulations regularly. Testing it will be very expensive, and if you weren't thoughtful of it from the get go I am worried you will be unpleasantly surprised. And if you are planning to sell in more than the US, it gets a lot more interesting.
should i check "download debugging symbols" and "download debug binaries (requires VS 2015 or later)" during the install process?
Well, you could start by reading the sidebar. That'll show you which sub you should use for posting this sort of question.

Since python had always been a ‚Äúscripting language‚Äù I never really took stuff like pep8 or writing tests very seriously. Then over time scripts would become messy projects that were annoying to debug and generally inconsistent with style and formatting. That lead to huge PRs with refactoring for testing and generally pep8 things. Definitely start each project as it‚Äôs something worth maintaining (unless it really is a one off script). Write tests, structure modules, use a linter.
I modified sanic-compress (which hasn't been updated in about two years) to use brotli compression for compatible browsers with a fallback to gzip.
smd
&gt; Disagree. Would you prefer atm.get(cash) or get(cash, atm) ?? The first makes more sense and flows more. Your example here is completely unrelated to "apply fn to iterable as op". Do you map functions on lists? Tuples? Or literally any and all arbitrary iterables? Why should my brand new Street object class not allowed to have the `increase_market_value_rel` function applied to all houses on the street? My Street isn't a predefined container type nor does it extend one. And before you say "it should be a member, then use a generator comprehension"-- no it shouldn't, because Sock objects should be able to increase in market value as well. &gt; yes there are cases where you only need a function for that case. And having to define it elsewhere means its not visible at the point where its used - its like defining vars at the top of a function like in C. Is your IDE that bad that it doesn't have a "go to definition" shortcut?
2G is already shutdown in Australia, guess I won't be using this. :'(
Have you tried closing the console and opening a new one to see if it gets picked up? Have you found out where the files were actually installed (note: you can do an OS file search for `plotly` to find possible candidates)?
Curious as to why you need multiline lambdas and what use do you have for lambdas in general. The only lambdas I've ever used is when I want to have a very small one line helper function inside another function for neatness, or when I do something like this: min(foo, key= lambda x: x[0]) Which is rarely more than a short statement. What do you use lambdas for?
&gt; could this not be addressed by using dunder functions like __ map __ etc? Just like an iterator must have a __ next __ That would mean that anyone who wants to write their own iterable class would need to recreate their own version of \_\_map\_\_. That's beyond stupid. &gt; (spaces due to stupid reddit formatting) RTFM
I don't have any files called plotly in my working directory and i just tried conda install -c plotly plotly. it gave me the same thing, but still no module. ughhh Downloading and Extracting Packages retrying-1.3.3 | 15 KB | ############################################################################ | 100% plotly-3.3.0 | 27.8 MB | ############################################################################ | 100% Preparing transaction: done Verifying transaction: done Executing transaction: done 
Write unit tests. Write tests for your tests. I wrote a test to check that two dates were within a specific range for each other, only I accidentally used the wrong comparison, thus hiding an application destroying bug for a week. &amp;#x200B; Seriously. Write unit tests. Like right now.
1) You can also monkey patch and add method to a Function after the fact. If self is _magically inserted_ then it become weird, you write a function that don't take self but will receive one ? By having methods take an explicit self you can manipulate them the way you like, and this highly simplify the internal of CPython that will just reuse the codepath for both methods and functions.
Do you, by any chance, have a file named plotly.py in the working directory?
I do not :/ what does that mean
I remember I ran into a somewhat similar issue where the package was installed but I had trouble importing it because I had a python file with the same name in the same directory. 
Can someone PM me, I really need to make this work on windows and don‚Äôt know anything about this kind of stuff

good stuff dude
Okay, I was unaware of this. I heard that it was Windows only and have only ever used it on Windows.
ok so do you have any other ideas?
Use this one: pip install PyMySQL I have been using it for years for both local and remote MySQL and MariaDB. https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL#installation
Can you try installing an earlier version of plotly?
looks pretty legit
It's not hot shit to be able to properly use if/else and conditionals inside of your code (this is referring to middle school me)

Lambdas are intended for anonymous functions, not named functions. There are situations where assigning a function to a variable makes sense, but PEP 8 explicitly recommends `def` statements over lambdas where possible. In this case: def get_bool_qsa(p, d): return strtobool(self.request.query_params.get(p), d) ... This is at least as readable as the lambda version, and comes with the benefit of better stack traces (which include the function name etc. appropriately). Most of the time if you want a multi-line lambda, a `def` statement is better. I'll admit, there are edge cases where I've wanted multi-line lambdas, but I strongly suspect the lack of that option has prevented more bad code than good code.
Yeah :( 
&gt; I think the JS (and other functional languages) order - obj.operation(fn) makes a lot more sense and is in fact more 'pythonic' w.r.t readability and comprehension. Most functional programming languages (I checked Haskell, Lisp, OCaml, and F# as I wrote this) do the same thing Python does. I'm guessing Python was copying Haskell (since that's where it stole list comprehensions from). In Haskell the signature of map is `(a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]`. The exact definition of a 'functional programming language' isn't universally agreed on, and for some definitions JS counts, but I know plenty of people who would be surprised by your calling it a functional language. Many of the languages that I can think of that follow the `obj.map(fn)` pattern are *not* functional languages. Ruby and Java, do this, but don't even have first class functions. Scala is the only language I can think of that I would call functional without too much worry about being contradicted that follows that pattern.
Most of the things you describe are something I wanted when I was learning python, but later I undestood the reasons behind them and changed my mind. Explicit *this* may seem unnecessary in simple cases, but consider this example with your proposed syntax: class C: def f(): def f2(): self.a = 1 # what does self refer to? ... Implicit *this* works in C++ because you can't nest functions and classes and even there you have to be aware of shadowing issues. Javascript is a mess in this regard, any time I have to write "var this2 = this;" to use current object in nested function, I wish I was writing python. Futhermore, explicit *this* allows us to create classes inside methods, consider this: class C: def f(self): class N: def ff(self2): self2.a = self.a ... Also, we can define function outsite class and then add it to a class. Explicit *self* effectively allows us to treat methods and free functions the same way: class C: pass def f(self, a): self.a = a C.f = f o = C() o.f(1) # works f(o, 1) # same thing Writing array.map(fn) requires that any type of iterable has methods like map, filter, sum, join, reduce, min, max, len, any, all, ... That may be fine when your language has only one type of array (or other iterable type), but python relies on duck typing so anyone can define type that behaves like a list and all these methods wil work with it. You can see the inferiority of the array.operation(arg) way in Javacript - arrays have all the methods you describe, but NodeLists have only forEach (exept in IE) and can not filtered or concatenated. In python, you can call filter, map or min with generator or numpy array, but in javascript you would have to convert ES6 generator or typed arras to regular arrays in order to call any of these methods. Pythons way of writting these expreessions may be less intuitive but it is better design-wise. Multiline lambdas are something I would like to see too, but since you can define functions anywhere and lot of filter and map uses are better written as generators anyway, it's hard to justify the huge syntax change it would require. Fat arrow syntax is subjective, there are far worse choices than the current lambda keyword in my opinion, like backslash (Haskell) or [] (C++). One of design priciples of python is to be explicit and lambda a, b: a &lt;= b is more explicit and clear than: (a, b) =&gt; a &lt;= b You have to understand that there has to be resistance to add new features, because every feature adds complexity and may not play well with other features. Each language has different design principles and cosiderations and what works well in one may not work so well in another. 
Made object(brand) recognition apps with example from tensorflow models. The project just works, the company is happy. My concern is that I don't really understand what exactly is going on with that code :| Also made a telegram bot to automatically push reports distribution (with telegram-bot py this just take 4-5 hours from learning to production). 
&gt; It just seems that having to define it in every class method explicitly, and I haven't seen any code which doesn't, shouldn't be needed. Personally, I like explicit self (and will point out that many coding style guides for other languages suggest distinct prefixes for member variables m_). Apart from being explicit for humans, "self" also brings functions and methods much closer together: E.g "self" allows a trivial move of a method into a standalone function (or a standalone function to a method). Or passing methods where functions are expected (try that with Java). And the there is a "minor" implementation issue: python compiler/runtime would not know whether bar = 24 refers to a local variable or a member variable.

&gt;You lag behind the official distribution significantly, like weeks, maybe a month. On this year's ICFPContest we used Python3.6, so Anaconda was right out. You said "This year's ICFPContest", it's 2018, Python 3.6 was released in 2016. You seem to be confused? Regardless, we do not lag behind. How can you claim we lag behind when there's no centralized entity for us to lag behind anyway? Do you mean relative to PyPI? Well, those packages are uploaded in an ad-hoc basis by the maintainers and many packages are not available for Python 3.7 yet whereas every package in Anaconda Distribution is availble for Python 3.7. Regarding your specific example, I find it fairly egregious since we released Python 3.6 on Dec 23 2016 with a large subsection of the ecosystem built-out for it on the same day on all 3 platforms. Guess when Python 3.6 was officially released? The exact same day: [https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/) Of course Anaconda Distribution is a rolling distro like ArchLinux, and we only do full installer releases 4 times a year, but on Dec 23 2016, you could have issued "conda install python=3.6" and you'd have been good to go so I have to call you out on this one. \&gt; You don't integrate with the `py` launcher. If the official launcher could support conda environments we'd support it, it doesn't so we don't. Anyway, conda's dynamic environment feature (far superior to venv) isn't a good fit for a \*single file association\*. \&gt; Launching Anaconda Python somehow adds about 2-3 seconds to the startup time, because it imports a lot of stuff from site\_packages or something. On a *fast* SSD. Every freaking time I run my stupid simple script that prints 0.9\*\*9 or some other throwaway thing. Official Python doesn't do that. The annoyance adds up over time. Again, I suspect you installed all of Anaconda and then used that as your primary environment? Well, guess what? Python will scan all those 200 odd packages in site-packages at startup because that's what Python does. Install 200 packages with upstream releases and you'll see the exact same thing. To Microsoft's credit, upstream Python is built very well these days on Windows, whereas if you repeat this experiment on Linux or macOS you'll find Anaconda Python to be \*far\* faster than most official releases or those provided by your distro (I run python-performance regularly to check this on all 3 platforms against the canonical binaries or those from other linux distros, I can share raw tables comparing python performance if you care, but you can see a graph on [this](https://github.com/AnacondaRecipes/aggregateMRO/) page - careful, contains facts). If you want to used Anaconda Distribution in a non-learner scenario, use Miniconda and minimal, isolated environments. You'll find Python spending a lot less time scanning site-packages that way. &gt;your repositories don't contain the build scripts themselves Incorrect, again. When does this misinformation stream stop? Our 'main' package recipes are [here](https://github.com/AnacondaRecipes/aggregate) (and most of them are forked from conda-forge though we're realinging them at present). Our 'r' package recipes are [here](https://github.com/AnacondaRecipes/aggregateR) and our 'MRO' packages [here](https://github.com/AnacondaRecipes/aggregateMRO/) &gt;When I get sucked into using alternative channels and trying to fix the stuff myself, I inevitably hit the fundamental by-design wall: your repositories don't contain the build scripts themselves. WHY. Like how am I even supposed to contribute if building stuff by hand involves hunting for random github repositories that usually don't exist at all? Why don't you have source packages that binary packages are built from? Are you afraid that then someone might clone your source repos and then offer binary repos for free just like you do? Mind boggles. (also, this probably contributes to the lagging behind the official distribution) At present mixing conda-forge and defaults has problems (these are down to ABI mismatch) so you should use one or the other only in a given environment. We're working to fix that, mainly by basing our recipes upon conda-forge's and submitting improvements back to them. This has created a huge pool of expert software builders, often involving the upstream maintainers directly in that effort, helping to ensure our builds are bullet-proof. Anaconda Distribution packages are often also a \*lot\* less resource hungry (memory, disk space) than those from PyPI because on PyPI if you want to use modern C++ in your extension module you end up statically linking to libstdc++ (or else you run into ABI issues). This means every C++ extension module you have will be pull in parts of the static code in libstdc++ leading to a large amount of duplication. We share a single libstdc++ with all packages so the text (code segments) get loaded in only once. Anyway would you consider fact checking your comments in future? That'd be great since you write quite well, shame the details are so far off-base! &amp;#x200B;

&gt; We use hardlinks when possible (nearly always) so that each file that is shared between environments exists on the disc only once. Oooh, that's a neat feature. Might be worth giving it another try for that because I am constantly setting up new virtual environments.
That‚Äôs because the import statement is trying to import the file named plotly (in your example, not OP‚Äôs). I ran into this once and was thoroughly confused for about an hour. 
Glad I managed to find one thing you like. I'd appreciate your comments on my comments, I found your criticism wholy unfair and almost entirely techincally inaccurate.
&gt;moog One thing to take care about with hardlinks is that when you edit one copy, you are editing them all, but editing the files in our packages isn't something you want to be doing at all.

The service it would have would only call one thing at a time, and frankly the processor isn't powerful enough to do anything voice processing on its own.

It's very easily deployable, regardless of system, because it comes with all dependencies. It also comes with Spyder and Jupyter already installed, which I like and use. It keeps your research python distribution separate from your main distribution.

Not to rain on your efforts, but there are simpler ways to get the data: 1. All of the Warframe worldstate data (which deathsnacks uses behind the scenes) is available here: http://content.warframe.com/dynamic/worldState.php 2. If you didn't want to go to the trouble of figuring out the structure of the official JSON, you could load the data that deathsnacks requests from its own server: https://deathsnacks.com/wf/data/alerts_raw.txt That saves you from having to parse HTML and execute Javascript to get at the data. Also, it's less load on the deathsnacks server. Also, if your kavat section, the `else` block is showing the number of nitain alerts.
One large difference between the two is that in python3 map and range both create iterators. In python 2 they create the full object in memory. 
And if you are managing multiple machines and operating systems, "convenient" quickly becomes "lifesaving".
Thanks so much! Pygame has a bad reputation in a similar way to Unity. Both have tons of beginners which produce games that make the library/engine look bad. Pygame is a bit more of an extreme case than Unity though. The only real limitations in Pygame are in VFX and base rendering size, so it works great for pixel art. When Pygame 2 comes out, things should really change for Pygame since it has full hardware acceleration. At that point, both the limiting aspects of Pygame will be gone. :D

Ok I just tried installing it and it seems to be working - I think I messed it up with zbar/pyzbar which indeed is not available for windows (through conda)
That looks like it has great community support. Thanks! Just the answer I was looking for.
That was great. Thanks!
Nah. There's nothing in that code that should take longer than a millisecond. Python3 can take a touch longer than Python2 with handling integers because Python3 has indefinite length integers rather than 64 bit integers, but otherwise it's usually faster. So it's an issue with that site.
You're welcome. Discovered this gem just yesterday and it hasnover two years ;)
I would like to believe it's Rust. It's the best mix of everything for me right now. If the ecosystem can catch up one day, it's gonna be Rust. If it does not catch up, then well, JavaScript. I don't personally like JS, but what can I do? :)
Questions of this kind is better suited for /r/learnpython 
I tried it too, first using Python3, then Python2, then C++. All were too slow (to clarify: the allowed time is 2 seconds, independent of the language used). Then I read the problem statement; it says "... This line is followed by N lines listing the catalog numbers of the CDs owned by Jack **in increasing order**, and M more lines listing the catalog numbers of the CDs owned by Jill **in increasing order**. ..." I guess that means there is an algorithm that makes use of that ordering for better efficiency.

Many many different solutions, depending on your level and goal. A very basic thing you should be able to apply as the minimum towards preserving info is writing to text files. So when you get some data your data structure (list or dictionary) can be dumped in a text file (csv or json or other) and then you can open the file parse it and load variables. So make sure you learn how to use this technique it's very straightforward and there are helper modules eg for json and csv. Then given your data is in serializable form, your objects can be dumped in a pickle which is a binary file that can preserve the state of this object. After reading the pickle you will see the same object. This is more straightforward (you don't care about lline breaks and encodings) but it's not good for all the cases. In general I avoid it, unless there is a specific reason to go with it. Finally, - and that's the big thing - you can write into databases. The best way I could suggest is learn how to use sqlite which is a very good and robust lightweight database (meaning can do everything a database can but cannot scale). Then use sqlite with sqlalchemy. This is a module that exposes sql syntax with python commands and making it engine agnostic. That way, switching from sqlite to mysql to postgres is a few lines change. 
You have to do df[mycol] = df[mycol].apply(func) But all this is available on stack overflow
Now we can build a robo answering service. 
If it's failing with c++, I'd suggest that the site's test is broken and it's still waiting for input. OP, can you post here the *exact* Python2 code that you say worked, so that we have something that works to compare with?
We're all consenting adults here. If we cannot abide by the rules of the CAPITALIZED_CONSTANT_NAME, a message from a linter surely isn't going to change the behaviour either.

Nice work! It's a really good feeling to write a utility and to see it working. Check out [f-Strings](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/) - they're a new feature of Python that makes string formatting easier, so you won't need to concatenate strings (or convert the number of items in the array to a string).
My just stupid what? Can't ask a sensible question, doesn't read the side-bar, can't write grammatically correct English, asks for free advice then insults those who give it... let me guess, are you 14?
It's great to have a goal like this!
&gt; Weak points: none! - Has zero effect at runtime - Can be fooled by setattr - Is generally as weak (by design, which isn't a bad thing) as everything else typing-related in Python - You can literally ignore it. You have to go out of your way to use a linter that checks for it.

Ah it‚Äôs fine lol, I was actually hoping to find some of the raw data but in my rush I guess I didn‚Äôt look there - as for the Kavat thing, oh well lol - just a silly mistake I guess :) ty for pointing them out

Ahhh, thank you - I really needed that icon\_path argument, and I'll bear in mind the rest of it. :) &amp;#x200B;
This belongs to /r/learnpython. That you haven't gotten an answer yet does not mean that it becomes topical in a subreddit that's not a support forum. 
Remnants of Java I'm afraid, lol
I don't think so. Looking through the posts in r/python it seems to me, that it's completly ok to ask such advanced questions here. And as you can see, I RTFM and my problem doesn't seem to be a thing to actually "learn", but to discuss with people who use the same software (pytest in this case) as I do. Have a nice day! &amp;#x200B;
Try it
Look near the top of the sidebar: "If you are about to ask a "how do I do this in python" question, please try r/learnpython or the Python discord." 
&gt;so it is assigning to self implicitly anyway. It just seems that having to define it in every class method explicitly, and I haven't seen any code which doesn't, shouldn't be needed. What about class methods then? Before you "wish a language would do something differently" you should master and understand that language first. 
&gt; I like languages that don't use a 'lambda' keyword which to me is redundant noise. Using =&gt; seems more expressive and natural and easier to grok. That is one decision that TypeScript really got wrong, in my opinion. The problem is that it's *too* terse, and almost indistinguishable from the `&gt;=` comparison operator. Meaning that it can be a source for hard-to-notice bugs, which are not caught by any linter/compiler at all. For example: var myFunction = function(x, weigher) { if (weigher) return weigher(x); else return "some other logic"; }; for (var x in something) doSomething(); myFunction(3, (x) &gt;= 5); // Oops 
Whats the purpose of the 3 lines under #Nitain and #Kavat?
consider to start using pylint, it will complain about this until you fix it
The way you wrote your code, you'd have to write this and it would work properly. for item in myBag.\_\_iter\_\_(): print(item) When using `for x in iterable`, this is the same as calling `next()` on the iterable itself. You'd be better off removing the bagiterator class and writing that logic into `__next__` of the bag class itself. This can be done using a generator. https://treyhunner.com/2018/06/how-to-make-an-iterator-in-python/
That looks beautiful. Thanks for letting me know :D
It seems to me that we are facing a transition from object oriented programming to functional programming. Many big companies are putting this into their road map, and new technologies such as big data may benefit from it. On the OOP side we are starting to see elements of functional programming as well. It's hard to say but at this time Haskell and Scala seem to me very good candidates, but even Python might change into something more functional. 
What do you mean with, Don't waste time on Django? 
&gt;&gt; Thanks to Anaconda I didn't have to install Visual Studio Whatever Free Version (but that matches the version that Python was compiled with) (4-8 Gb download by the way) &gt; VSCode is *entirely* optional and always has been. It is fetched on demand only if you elect to install it. This is your first (glaring, easily debunked) inaccuracy. I was describing the past horrors of __not__ using Anaconda here. &gt; Regardless, we do not lag behind. How can you claim we lag behind when there's no centralized entity for us to lag behind anyway? Do you mean relative to PyPI? Well, those packages are uploaded in an ad-hoc basis by the maintainers and many packages are not available for Python 3.7 yet whereas every package in Anaconda Distribution is availble for Python 3.7. Yeah, I was talking about 3.7, which was released on June 27, 2018, looking at numpy changelog they released https://github.com/numpy/numpy/releases/tag/v1.15.0rc2 with 3.7 compatible wheels on Jul 10; by July 18 or so when I had to decide what to use, I could only find a few discussion threads on github with people beginning to try Anaconda with 3.7 using weird private channels and whatnot. IIRC numpy was actually already available, but there were some dependencies incompatible with conda itself with really weird results. I guess my main problem here is not the lag as such (usually I'm OK with not using the latest Python for a month or two), it's the state of helplessness: when I'm using stock Python I have a range of (increasingly painful) options to get what I want, from compiling from source myself to trying to fix the source myself. Anaconda tries to hide all the pain but in the process also removes these options. &gt;&gt; You don't integrate with the py launcher. &gt; If the official launcher could support conda environments we'd support it, it doesn't so we don't. By "integrating" I meant registering the interpreter in the Windows registry so you can invoke it with "py -3". &gt; Our 'main' package recipes are here (and most of them are forked from conda-forge though we're realinging them at present). Our 'r' package recipes are here and our 'MRO' packages here I stand corrected, that complaint originated from my previous much earlier Anaconda-wrestling experience, I guess.
Congratulations! Nice work for a python beginnerüëç
pytest looks for fixtures in the current module, then the directory's conftest.py, then the parent directory's conftest.py, etc You need to move your fixture somewhere pytest can see it.
It goes for me personally, I spent some time using Django because it was the first Python web framework I learned. But in the end I realized that I rarely ever needed more than [web.py](https://web.py) or flask. So in retrospect I consider the time I spent with Django relatively wasted.
Looking at it again (after the downvote), it looks like you are trying to run pytest on a fixture, which is not possible. You can only run tests on functions that are not fixtures themselves.
He asked the remind-me bot to send him a notification one day from his post (today) to see what answers had been given to you.
My biggest problem has been trying to untangle a lot of the example code out there. Many examples lack the structure of a traditional software application. There are often many cross cutting concerns that make it difficult to tell where boilerplate ends and AI magic begins.
&gt; [...] and all of it has been random programs with no use (such as saving inputted names to a file) and I was getting a bit demotivated Props for sticking with it. I remember my first days programming were not very different. Especially because simple things like writing names into a file seems really pointless. But all these small exercises you see in school are but small puzzle pieces. They will become useful later on. The problem with many programming courses is that they fail to demonstrate how these little pieces of code work together to make something more interesting. But that is also very difficult to do in the short time-frame you have in 9th/10th grade (as there are so many other subjects to cover as well). Try to see those small bits and pieces as tools in your toolbelt. The more of those little helper you have at your ready, the easier programming will become in the future. You did the right thing: You took your knowledge you learned and adapted them to something useful. That's the way to go! Don't stop!
Nice overview. Thanks for sharing. 
Thank you for the clarification. I have been looking online since you posted and while I found a number of tutorials to deploy using Zappa which seems great, the one that that confuses me is that it seems like I have to set up routes within Django but isn't that what the API Gateway is for? Meaning traffic for a specific URL GET /users for example would call a specific Python Lambda for getting users from the database?
Thank you 
Dicts are the most useful built in data structure in Python!
Check out Net Ninja's tutorial. He takes you through building a blog site from the ground up. Was really helpful for me for someone with minimal level programming experience. 
We have a policy of not releasing rc or beta software, if we did, they'd have later version numbers, conda update --all would install them and people would be very rightly annoyed. Regarding Python 3.7 and numpy, upstream were just not unready for 3.7 at all, and if anyone released wheels at 3.7's release date they would have been badly broken. Having said that, we patched the bug the day we were made aware of it and had the first Python 3.7 compatible numpy out the very mext day as far as I am aware: [https://www.opensourceanswers.com/blog/you-shouldnt-use-python-37-for-data-science-right-now.html](https://www.opensourceanswers.com/blog/you-shouldnt-use-python-37-for-data-science-right-now.html)
This is my problem, too. I can do all tutorials but they are structured and code is used in a way that I can also see how to solve the one specific problem they are trying to solve, but dont allow me to translate the code to other problems.
Nice, that sounds like something I would be interested in. Please keep us updated on your progress. 
Making an ascii roguelite with pygame.
wow, super cool and well thought project! Have you thought about using altair or plotly for plotting package instead of matplotlib for your Django app?
WingIDE ?
Agreed. It's too verbose with little use (IMHO). 
&gt; we are facing a transition from object oriented programming to functional programming I havent noticed this. What makes you say this? Python is a multi-paradigm language but the lack of tail recursion hampers it in this respect.
Great library, just what I needed, but there's a problem. Needed just a simple form, enter some stuff and submit. Right out of the Cookbook. But if the user hits enter after an entry, which is somewhat logical, the program exits. Any way around this?
&gt; I would like to believe it's Rust. that's 2 votes for Rust... I couldnt stand it myself.
I would pray that something like [Eve](http://witheve.com/) becomes mainstream. I will always love Prolog. But practicality beats all this idealism which is why it's Python day in and day out for me.
Good thing I didn't have to pay for that tutorial.
Sorry for the necro post, but could you update it? planing to try the same
&gt; Isn't that cleaner! No.
+1 for this belonging in /r/learnpython /r/python isn't really a support sub. /r/learnpython even has rules against asking questions that are too simple. &gt; my problem doesn't seem to be a thing to actually "learn" You have a question/problem looking for a solution/input. If you're not expecting to learn anything then what's the point of the post? /r/learnpython follows the template of subs like /r/learnprogramming which are absolutely for questions like this. Judging by the formatting of your original post you didn't read the sidebar very well. It tells you how to format code **and** would have directed you to /r/learnpython.
I have already build more complicated example (clone on Eliza logic + wikipedia api). Now working on the article and hope to publish soon.
IMO examples don't really teach you anything about machine learning. Doing a high level over MOOC like Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course on Coursera is extremely valuable. There are far too many "plug and chug" cowboys who use boilerplate examples and don't understand the underlying algorithms. I.E. why would we choose a logistic regression approach over a SVM or simple neural network. And don't do proper model validation. "AI" (which I would even struggle to call this; almost all of this is just curve fitting at the end of the day) really needs to be understood at a level below the model.fit(x,y) to be useful. This is especially true when shit starts hitting the fan and one needs to find out why the model is shitting the bed. Most of theses demos are not written in a traditional software sense because they are meant to be a one-time, linearly run operation. Intake data, fit model, validate model, predict based on new data. I came from a MATLAB background and that style of "programming" (if you'll call even it that) is really the approach a lot of these examples take. Anyway, just my 0.02.

You are the man! I was just diving into creating an application that prioritizes the needs of the customer based on real world events and rules and re-adapting them for the user. I was definitely thinking that machine learning would be useful in this regard.
For example, giving an object as arg?
Agree with you too. It's a disservice to put training wheels on regex'es - and hubris to assume no one will ever use a language other than python.
If you want the window to remain open after the user "submits" then you need a Persistent Window. Take a look at the Cookbook and in the User Guide for info on these. &amp;#x200B; To create one of those, replace the button call from Submit or Button to ReadButton('Submit'), or RButton('Submit'). This type of button leaves the window open. The short-cut buttons, like Submit() close the window. &amp;#x200B;
I have found through my own experience that even though there are several webpages that will help instruct and teach python ‚Äúfor beginners‚Äù the best way to step into the language is buying a book on the topic. A physical book is the best way to begin learning how to program and code.
A little history, just enough to explain why some things are the way they are because of limitations that existed in computers 40 years ago.
Good work! My kids are your age and lately they have been spending too much time on Fortnite and not enough on constructive stuff like this. You've inspired me to try and inspire them!
The top voted posts in /r/learnpython should give you a hint at what's missing. Asking here will probably not reach your target audience. 
First of all, you formatting is all off. Please fix this as indentation is important in python. Furthermore, can you clarify what you mean? You code works as intended. Minor thing a string can be passed to input. Thus you can have age = input('How old would Bill be...')
Thanks for the advice, just posted it!
Thanks, but The user isn't hitting a button, they hit the enter key and it submits, I \_want\_ it to submit if they use the button. So I would like to persist after an enter keyboard key, but the button should close and return. Or am I not understanding what you are saying? &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
sorry about the indentation, it just came out like that when i pasted it from the program. my code doesnt work as it wont let me define the name of my human from the shell in the fashion im attempting &amp;#x200B;
you are making an object `name` which is of type `human` If you want to add a name parameter you would need to add the name to the object you have made. So more logically would be someHuman = human(w, a) someHuman.name = name or add it in the class declaration.
but that would mean creating a new value for "human" called name, i would like to assign my entire "human" values to a name that can be defined by the user &amp;#x200B;
You can name it anything you want. But then how do you refer to it without delving into globals? Alternatively you can add the names in a dict with keys (names) mapping to human object
According to you, which book should I go for? 
What you want is a parameter in the button.... bind\_return\_key. This will cause that particular button to be "clicked" when the user presses the return key. If you're using a pre-defined button, like Submit, you'll find the parameter in there. It's also in the Button and RButton calls. If this change doesn't do what you want (I'm pretty sure it will), can you post your code, or the GUI portion of your code? &amp;#x200B;
I am still learning but I learnt the basics of using python from ‚ÄúAutomate the boring stuff‚Äù and then did udacity full stack web developer and will recommend them for a total beginner, they really go through the smaller details which is ideal for total beginners.
How much cheat sheets on ML and AI do we really need?

I'm looking, I think your demo would do it, but I'm getting yanked around, might be this afternoon, but I deeply appreciate your attention.
There are lots of large companies that like to hire recent grads into new analyst positions. Where I work I think it takes about 2 years to work up from a beginning analyst to a beginning data scientist, getting paid well and gaining real world experience. Find the smart people and learn from them as much as possible. It's education you get paid for, and you learn about an industry and what things you do and don't like working on. On top of that most large companies, mine included, have programs to pay for your grad school after you're worked for a little while (1 year for me). If you're a motivated self-learner this is a really smart way to go. It's hard to find good analysts.
Thanks! I'll take a look.
I can understand this. When I was learning Python the first confusing thing was how recurring decimals were different in hexadecimal.
Python with curly braces instead of regimented whitespace.

Generally speaking this has been a slow change. Functional programming, as we intend it today, was developed from the end of the seventies (check the Turing Award Lecture by J. Backus form 1977 if you're interested). At that time most of the efforts were into consolidating the imperative paradigm, which has been a strong trend for at least 10 years later. Then in the nineties object oriented programming was all the rage and took the scene. After the failed attempt of Lisp to change the world there was a bit of reluctance to go back to functional programming again, at least on production, but nevertheless functional programming has been rinsing in the shadow, mostly inside academia. Nowadays we have good examples of software developed using the functional paradigm. For instance the spam filter at Facebook is entirely written in Haskell; or the Apache Spark computing system which is mainly written in Scala. Another good example is WhatsApp which is written in Erlang, due to its ability to manage distributed and concurrent applications. All these languages solve in elegant ways many problems which occur nowadays, and these examples are suggesting to me that we are now in a transition era. Going back to Python I have no clear view, but I think there is a LOT of work to be done in this direction. Only by judging from this arising trend, which I think is going to be more evident in the next 10 years, Python itself will face some kind of change. There is no need for Python to implement a fully-fledged functional interface (and it probably never will), but the point is on how Python will sit among those new technologies.

My advice would be to refactor your code so that you aren‚Äôt naming class instances based on user input. That would in general be a bad programming practice. Much better would be to store the name you want as an attribute of the class like the other poster mentioned. You may think you need to write the code this way, but it‚Äôs very unlikely that you actually do For your own curiosity though, you could into the eval function in python 
Yeah, ignore the haters. This is really great. I need to use a regex maybe once every 2 years, and I never remember how it works. 
all good advice, I would add to investigate the standard library, there are gems hiding there.

How does tqdm become difficult to manage lol
 If you write scripts or notebooks, ``tqdm.tqdm()`` is just fine, but there are many cases where it becomes more complicated, notably if you are writing libraries, or if you are writing code that will be run on a server. One example is that tqdm requires you to write ``tqdm.tqdm()`` in a console and ``tqdm.tqdm_notebook()`` in a notebook. When you are writing a library you don't know in advance which environment the user will use it in, so which do you write ? If your user runs the library on a server, neither ``tqdm.tqdm()`` nor ``tqdm.tqdm_notebook()`` will be useful, as the progress bars won't be sent to the client. Another example is: I am using a library A which in turn uses a library B which has a progress bar, but I don't want the progress bar of library B, because in my use case it is annoying. How do I turn off library B's progress bar ? In most cases, you can't. Proglog brings solutions to these problems. It wraps tqdm and other solutions so that the end user decides if they want console progress bars, notebook progress bars, if they want to mute a progress bar, etc.
Thanks!
This is a side project (kinda small). Recently, discovered the NLTK library and wanted to utilize it on articles written on Medium. The idea is to be able to determine the part of speech in the article and display the results to the user. For example, I want to display the top used nouns, adjectives, verbs, etc etc. I thought it be useful for both a writer and a reader. Sometimes long articles on Medium are pretty long so running my script on the article would allow you to possibly get what would be discussed through the diction and help you determine if it sparks your interest aka if you want to invest time. In the case of a writer, it will help you see what words you use too often and help you become aware of words you might want to use less.
If you want to learn the basics of python you should check out codecademy. It'll teach you enough to get started. Then it's just a matter of practicing and making yourself do challenging, complicated projects
Ill check it out. Thanks for the feedback!

Nice work ! I can see myself using this to build the regex in a "cheaty" way to build complex regexes. Thanks man !

Well this is dumb as fuck, cant wait to see what dumb fuckin word people are offended by next. 
I actually see a larger gap in the middle area, the intro user has a ton of 'hello world' examples on multiple frameworks or any number of starter projects, then you have a gap and then way more advanced level items. Someone needs to come in and fill in the step between the two. 
I wrote [etlalchemy](https://github.com/seanharr11/etlalchemy) that facilitates this ETL process. It boasts the feature of enabling cross-RDBMS migrations, i.e. MySQL -&gt; PostgreSQL, or SQL Server -&gt; MySQL. That said, it should handle your case just fine, as it is an easier case. All this said - it runs on Python2.7 only, has a few bugs, a bunch of outstanding github issues, and one unattended Pull Request. I need to spend some time cleaning everything up and writing tests. But this should get the job done! Let me know how it goes for you.

&gt;Generally speaking this has been a slow change. I think Clojure is the strongest argument for the power of functional programming... other things like J/APL are sexy but what can you get done. Haskell is so finicky about I/O that I never could just toy along and develop iteratively.
there's already hylisp - a way to use Python with Lisp syntax.

This looks really cool! I was a little surprised by the following snippet: `any_of(in_range('a', 'z') + in_range('0', '9') + text('-')` Conceptually, wouldn't it be better for a function named `any_of` to take a list as its input?

Similarly, one could write a library so that instead of having to write f = (9/5) * c + 32 you could just write f = add( multiply( divide( 9, 5 ), c ), 32 ) I could see using it as training wheels, but given some practice regexes don't have to be a black art.

&gt; Regarding Python 3.7 and numpy I'm not sure what that bug has anything to do with. My point is that in the ideal world I'd expect this to happen the moment Python 3.7 is released: * there's an opportunity to create a new env with python=3.7 within a day. The dependency graph for packages with "python=3.7" is available. Users are made aware that all "python=3.7" stuff is currently beta when installing. * there's an automatically managed publicly available dashboard that shows packages that support the "python=3.7" trait, green for all unit tests passing, yellow for building but some unit tests failing, red for build errors, gray for having red dependencies. * The backend for the dashboard is maintained entirely automatically, you automatically try to rebuild everything and run tests assuming that everything is python3.7 compatible the moment python3.7 is released, then rebuild affected stuff as people push compatibility updates. * There's a wiki page prominently linked from the dashboard (which itself is prominently linked as "I like to live on the edge" from the https://www.anaconda.com/download/) that explains how to build from source your way, how to override your dependency specifications, and of course how to install and use visual studio build tools if you're willing to walk this road. Is that too much to ask for? That sounds just like good devops to me, you're probably using it internally anyways, why not make it public? Instead I got this: https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/9686 - a bunch of people reenacting the ancient fable of feeling around an elephant and the crushingly depressing feeling that while the ContinuumIO people are probably working on releasing a 3.7 version, that happens in an entirely different world from where we do live our lives, with no projections on when they'll finish it, no way to fix something ourselves, and no way to help. And the part where the main problem was conda itself causing dependency conflicts (while numpy installed just fine!) and the implication that nobody used or was fixing conda for py3.7 at that point in time, almost a month after the release. &gt; Which Python 3 interpreter though? Conda's all about the multiple environments. No. No no no. I don't need multiple environments to run my scripts, I'm pretty fine with installing a new version of Python to `c:\python37` and deleting `c:\python36`, like, manually and physically. I understand why a web-programmer might want to have separate environments for each of her customers. This is not my use case, and I'm not alone in that as demonstrated by the existence of the `py` launcher and the _freaking default full Anaconda_ in the first place. Why would I even want to install a full Anaconda if I wanted a reproducible install for my customers achieved via maintaining separate envs for each? If you wanted people to use separate environments you'd put a link to miniconda somewhere on https://www.anaconda.com/download/, no? It's not there, there's no mention of miniconda there, most of your users don't even know that miniconda is an option, for fuck's sake man, your point is defeated by your own website. There's a simple use case: I want to install miniconda to become my default 3.x python, and an environment inside that would become my default 2.x python. Both added to PATH, with python3/python2 aliases and available for invocation via `py -3`/`py -2`. This works on Linux when I compile Python from source and install it to the default /usr/local location, bypassing the built-in package manager. Don't you think that achieving the no-bullshit usability of _compiling from source on Linux_ is a bar that you must be able to clear? &gt; I detailed all of the technical benefits to installing from Anaconda (space, speed, security) are those of no interest to you? Those are of interest to me, thank you for making me aware, I might try Anaconda again in the future if some of those things become really important to me. My singular point was that two years ago I was recommending Anaconda to anyone asking "I'm a newbie, how do I install Python on Windows and get to the programming in Python part with as less of a hassle as possible?". Because it was, just install it and you can go programming stuff! But these days Anaconda is actually more hassle than the official Python, so on _that_ axis you kinda lost. It was (**NO HASSLE**, stuff I don't care about) and now it's (space, speed, security, some hassle).

I would look into making functions and classes. Any project that requires a good deal of abstraction. If you are more familiar with programming, i recommend making a super basic website with Flask. It may seem daunting, but essentially every fundamental concept of using python is covered. Maybe take your calculator and try and make a simple web interface. 
Well to be fair there are very few people that actually push the boundaries of code and create something new, and we call these "unicorn startups" or "academics at MIT". Most of the time coding is a way to elegantly, customize a solution that already existed, to fit a companies need.

Your question doesn't really belong here, but you might have more luck in /r/learnpython. You'll get better results there if you can somehow focus your question a little more and simplify the problem. Posting a wall of data probably doesn't help. And fix your code indentation.
It took me a while to understand the format when putting it a post, sorry about the indentation. How do you think I can simplify the problem?

Hi, pretty neat program. I would suggest adding some data sanitation. To your credit, if you enter a non-integer number of sides, the program doesn't throw an error, but it also doesn't correct the user and let them know they've provided an invalid input. Good job on forcing a similar case comparison on the Y/N. Rather than using `.capitalize()` on the input, you could use `.lower()` or `.upper()`, although I don't know if there's any reason outside of personal preference (I just see `.upper()` more than `.capitalize()`); again, I would limit acceptable inputs to ones your program is built to handle.
Oh my. Thanks!
I should have added an exception clause. Thanks!
Nice! Next, you can expand it to roll 3d6, 4d6 (take best 3), etc.

I run a 7 year old open source project. Don't make more work for the developers. Just make another post on the existing issue. Devs don't follow up because they're busy. Maybe it's not an issue the dev who was dealing with it particularly interested in. Often it's just because the original poster didn't provide enough info/a good test case or they forgot. A simple reminder goes a long way. When I'm responding to an issue and I see that a question I ask takes a week or two to get a reply, I know it's not that important. You gotta stay engaged or why should I? It's obnoxious when something sits there for two months. At some point, I close it with good enough.
I'm not trying to help, but checking my own understanding. `sudo su -` launches 2 processes: `sudo` and `su`. `sudo -s` launches just 1 process and does the exact same thing. Downvoters don't care to explain themselves and I'm left wondering whether it's a problem with them or is it me misunderstanding this.
That's tough. You could try writing your own "hidden" function plus harness to research what you can change. Any thing that works in your "toy" example is worth trying on the real problem. Also try [introspection](http://zetcode.com/lang/python/introspection/) on the mystery module to get another view of what's inside. To make it easy to format code, just use your IDE/editor to indent **all** your code by four spaces, copy/paste into reddit and then "undo" the indentation in the IDE/editor. Takes about 10 seconds and must give good results as long as the formatted code follows an empty line.
Ok, their down voting because I asked a question and your response, while logical in your own mind, seems like a totally wrong attempt to "answer" my question. There is actually only one process launched and, while there is some nuance to the different methods (https://askubuntu.com/questions/376199/sudo-su-vs-sudo-i-vs-sudo-bin-bash-when-does-it-matter-which-is-used) they are effectively doing the same thing, getting you a root shell.
Quality advice, thanks a lot. I‚Äôll go check out introspection when I finish studying for my CS exam. Do you know much about Python internals and the libraries that they included in the commented code?
Do any python NN‚Äôs have the ability to use Nvidia tensor cores?
You could make it real easy. Roll 6x or whatever number is chosen. Each time put the values rolled in a list. Sort the list in descending order and slice it and take the first 3 values. Here is how you slice: Rolls[:3] That will return the first 3 numbers in your list. You don‚Äôt need a single if loop. No comparisons needed. Just roll, sort, slice.
Thanks! I'll get that sorted after I figure out the if sided == or != issue. Trying to figure out how to get it to make you choose a valid sided option, but nothing I am expecting to work is working.

Ah yes. I read about that. The problem is am a newbie to Python and Apache. Hence the hardship of not knowing how what works üòÅ
Currently trying to fix that, but I am having a real time. Some if loops are not acting like others and it is really throwing me for a loop. Not sure what's wrong, and not sure why some things are working.
That's ok it's a good way to learn. Just look up the puckel docker airflow image which will get your a running airflow server in a few
For your second example, the argument sounds fallacious to me. Why don't you take the numpy array and list creation out of the code you want to compare? You are comparing execution times to create a np array, a list and sum the elements vs. create a list and sum the elements. 
Also the first stackoverflow shows that a **Python indexing** over a numpy array is slow (the example with cython indexing shows that numpy becomes faster than Python on that matter...)
r/learnpython would be a better place for this.
I use the "setup" argument to timeit. List creation doesn't get include in the timed loop.
That's the idea. It's not immediately obvious to many the indexing a numpy array would be significantly slower than indexing a python list.

python3-pip is its own package in Linux. I would assume there is a similar situation in Mac. Also, only a guess, because I'm not very familiar with Mac's ecosystem but a lot of software tends to depend on python 2 so that may be why its not being uninstalled. Hope that helps some.

If you want I could write a really simplified version of your code as an example without all the if statements. Just so you can see another way of doing it that is quicker and can handle any die size. I'm not sure what a modifier is though? I googled 'die modifier' and it sounds like with D&amp;D a modifier is a number that's added to whatever you roll. Is that what it should do?

Your arguments are a bit obtuse to me. Accessing a single value at a time isn't what numpy is optimised for. I would expect most of what you're seeing is overhead. Try take a list of a 1000 items and setting them all to 1 vs a numpy array. I would expect a builtin with no overhead to be faster for this non vector operations. For your second example, you're using python routines on non python objects, and comparing performance to python builtins. When it sees a primitive, python can optimise the hell out of that, while when it sees an unknown object, it will have to call that objects add methods. However if you do np.sum, numpy knows the object types and can do an optimised add. The problem here is that numpy (as is pandas, tensor flow, numba etc) is a sub language that happens to be in python. And mixing languages is bound to be slow. Having two numpy arrays and using a for loop to add them would be very slow, but proves nothing. Your examples are quite contrived and honestly, are examples of code that would never exist. Calling them pitfalls is disingenuous because your have to work very hard to have code like this show up

Yes, a modifier is if you have a bonus to a roll. For example, roll a d10 +4. I'm still very new to Python, so I struggled a bit to get to where I am now. I'll work on that.
Google Colab could be an option. 
Jim likes this. Jim likes this very much.
Why even start a shell in this case? There are no need for shell expansion, so starting yum without that overhead should be fine by itself. 
That's a bit beyond my skill level, but I'll figure it out!

Python,node.js, pip,npm,ffmepg, atom editor they all work fine. And the bat script I worked sets the varaibles then pauses when I press enter it removes the varible and puts it back to the defualt so that there I no sign of me being there...

Where should I start?
I used this during a code challenge (unfortunately for a PHP job, not Python) and it was neat. Recommended!
I've written a ton of super messy code that looped through files and ran various external commands in python. I created these two modules because while writing that code I kept thinking "I wish something like this existed": * For searching for files and looping through them: https://github.com/crdoconnor/pathquery * For running commands: https://github.com/crdoconnor/commandlib
Cool. Keep up the good [work](https://github.com/impshum/Drumpf-Troll).
I was gonna use this for a bot a few days ago actually. Seemed a good tool for r/outsidethesoulstone but I got bored as I don't understand Marvel that much. It's a good API though.
can you share a list of projects you guys are working on? 
No idea. The pep doesn't explain it either. I've found that earlier version of SQL-server used 28, so maybe that the inspiration.
&amp;#x200B; &gt;there's an opportunity to create a new env with python=3.7 within a day. The dependency graph for packages with "python=3.7" is available. Users are made aware that all "python=3.7" stuff is currently beta when installing An 'env' is different for everyone. It will contain 3rd party software they need. It is upstream's responsibility to make their s/w compatible. They are often voulanteers. What do you propose? Holding a gun to their heads on Python patch release day so they fix their packages, then another to ours so we build them the same day. For sure, we could easily release the Python interpreter the same day it comes out (and often do) but for most people, an interpreter isn't enough. &gt;Is that too much to ask for? That sounds just like good devops to me, you're probably using it internally anyways, why not make it public? We have internal tools, they are far from pretty and I don't see that it's worth the effort to make them pretty and secure. Also no one but yourself has ever brought this up, to the best of my knowledge. To be clear, you cannot throw up a CI system, some web UIs, some dashboards and then crank out a cross-platform software distribution with full rebuilds nightly. It takes months for upstreams to become compatible, and some projects will simply drop off the radar at a patch release that breaks compatibility. The upstreams are frequently just volunteers. For a few projects I wrote the patches to add Python 3.7 support. For Python 3.7.0 I had to build 3500 packages. Of those, about 1 in 50 were incompatible or otherwise broken. Each of these needs to be investigated and fixed. By hand, by the Anaconda Distribution team. That takes time. &gt;No. No no no The we're not optimizing for your particular use case, still it's a use case that I think most would embrace (projects ending in \`env\` are common in Python!) . Isolation and mimimal dependencies are good things. &gt;If you wanted people to use separate environments you'd put a link to miniconda somewhere on [https://www.anaconda.com/download/](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), no Multiple envs works just as well with an AD env created via the Anaconda Installer, so I don't see your point. Personally I'd like to see Miniconda get a bit more promotion, so I do my bit. My point is not defeated, and this is not a competition, I'm just defending what I work on against your merciless attacks. &gt;Instead I got this: [https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/9686](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/9686) Bugs happen in any project of sufficient complexity. That one was open for 2 days before we fixed it, we try to do better of course but we're human. We constantly strive to improve our processes to prevent them though. Anyway, you seem to be obsessed with the latest shiny stuff, I'd recommend trying to wind that back, shiny stuff (the Python 3.7.0 ecosystem shortly after 3.7.0 release, for example) usually has a lot of rough edges. When did you go from "Anaconda's great" to "? Are you afraid that then someone might clone your source repos and then offer binary repos for free just like you do? Mind boggles" nonsense stuff from? Whart did Anaconda do to you in the interveneing period to make you so cynical? .. apart from not being able to provide the very latest version of some dependency you tried to use at a coding contest that took part at a particularly tumultuous - too many grammar and behavioural changes for a point release - time \*for the entire Python ecosystem\*. &gt;But these days Anaconda is actually more hassle than the official Python, so on *that* axis you kinda lost. It was (**NO HASSLE**, stuff I don't care about) and now it's (space, speed, security, some hassle). Apart from less package coverage (provided we have what a user needs) I don't believe you've managed to articulate this hassle here. As many other commmenters in this thread say, it just works for them. TBH I believe you're grasping at straws to find things to criticise. I am not trying to score points against you or win an argument on the internet, I just had to refute your misinformation regarding the thing I work on. &amp;#x200B;
Hi man!! Can you help me with the resources i need to develop telegram bot on python and also i checked your code can't be use hashing instead?
The most unambiguously correct change I can suggest is to convert sided to an integer (using a try / except block to catch invalid input). There doesn't appear to be any reason you would want a non-number input. sided=input() try: sided=int(sided) except ValueError: print('%s isn't a number' % (sided,)) continue if sided not in (100, 20, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2): print('Invalid choice...') continue Also, in the case that sided=2, you ask for a modifier but it is never used; AFAICS the correct thing would be to just not ask for the modifier in that case.
I've used open source python-telegram-bot API, good impressions left. link : [https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot)
Or to people who actually work with regular expressions (as opposed to those who use them to accomplish other tasks, typically, string matching). For people who work with regular expressions, ability to dynamically construct them is important. Perhaps, in the future, author will also add product, union, division and other useful operations on regular expression...
Thanks for the reply. As of now there's no reason for me to roll back any transactions, even if one fails. As long as neither the database nor my Python code throws an error because of two processes trying to write to the same record at the same time, I'm good. Are there any database settings I should check to verify that two simultaneous attempts to write to the same record will be handles sequentially by the database, or is this such a basic feature of any database system that it's safe to assume it will just work?
I'd recommend [appdirs](https://pypi.org/project/appdirs/), which save you from headache when you need to, e.g. store config for a cross-platform app.
in the terminal you can write `python3 path/to/file.py`
Sure, let me know if something isnt working as expected

Actually it does you just missed it. Financial people like to know when numbers are going to round. When use floating point, the point floats so when numbers round are not predictable and are inconsistent this makes Financial people insane.
I just finished working out the linting errors of my python Card Generator - Pylint really is a harsh mistress. The code generates fancy looking backlog items form an XML input using Reportlab. My scrum team uses it so it has a physical Scrum Board for our Daily Scrum. If somebody here also does Scrum, feel free to check it out https://github.com/Tarkleigh/CardGen
I had no idea something like this exists! Thanks OP!
I generaly agree. My distro's package manager (OpenSuse Tumbleweed) contains all the packages I need and provides the updates. I rarely use pip. However I can see a use case where an esoteric module may be needed and not in the package manager. Then I see little risk in using pip to install since there's no chance of conflict. 
This could be fun to use, I have to model some data for a class and the project is pretty open ended, what type of data could I model using the API that could show some sort of relationships?

Both are pretty terrible. I'd use Kivy, if anything.
Subprocess for running processes under python and interacting with them is worth learning (think is.system but much more you can do). Pywin32 if you're on windows and want access to windows apis. Psutil for process monitoring is another good one as already mentioned.

A great resource people who are /r/learnpython ing.
Two reasons why accessing a single value in a NumPy array is slower than accessing a single value in a list that have not been explicitly stated yet: 1. array[i] has to create and return (a pointer to) a brand new Python object holding the value. OTOH list_[i] just needs to return (a pointer to) the existing Python object that was in the list. (I am assuming we‚Äôre working in CPython here.) 2. NumPy indexing is far, far more complicated than list indexing. The code that implements getitem on arrays is thousands of lines long. This adds some additional overhead to the operation.
This is a nice introduction to testing. It might be nice to have a section on code coverage. 
Oh wow. Good thing I asked before investing hours into them. Will give kivy a look.
That's why I keep applying to new jobs. Yet I get nothing. Oh well guess I'm not that clever ha ha^ha^please^kill^me
Looks awesome. Just saw it at the all things open 2018 keynote while talking about python. I am making a game based on veggies but not in python unfortunately
Hey, I'm a bit confused because in the script, there are only 10 frames and 10 png files, how do you create such a smooth GIF out of only 10 frames?
Surely you would need a few hundred frames as this GIF look like 60fps?
You can set it to 240 and get a 4 second gif at 60 FPS. An updated, cleaner script is available here: https://github.com/heysoose/Shades
You should probably have included np.sum(x) in there as a test a well, which is "the numpy way". It's almost as fast as the python bit, although also a bit more flexible in what it acutally does (choose your dimensions/indeces).
"Best" is highly subjective. It would all depend on the kind of web site or web application you're planning on building.
Is there anywhere I could see that online?
Here's the source code, I've officially released the first beta version: [https://github.com/AstronomyLiveYt/SatTraker](https://github.com/AstronomyLiveYt/SatTraker)
I would give Learn Python the Hard Way. It is easy to understand and teaches: learning by doing. It contains countless examples that build off of each other and get more complex as they go 
If you're interested in learning more about how things work "under the hood" so to speak, you could try implementing some of the essential python data structures (arraylist, hashtable) in a language like C. The reason I would say this isn't as fun in python, is that it feels kind of silly when you're implementing an arraylist using what is underneath (I believe) an arraylist. I've never tried a hashtable before, but I'm pretty sure the K&amp;R book provides an implementation. Not sure if this fits your definition of fun, though ;)
Oh thank you so much, that makes sense.
She(@nnja on twitter) said there will be a video uploaded eventually but for now here are the slides https://speakerdeck.com/nnja/five-things-you-didnt-know-python-could-do?slide=9
I've had both show up in practice. They are easy to avoid if you know to avoid them. That's why they are pitfalls (dropoffs you don't see until you go down them), and not show stoppers. Here is an example of the second pitfall I've run into. I have a graph with nodes, the nodes have weight. The weights we're computed with numpy. I want to calculate the total weight of a subset of nodes. I have a dictionary mapping nodes to weights. I get the subset weight by running `sum(mapping[node] for node in subset)`. When the mapping is to numpy floats, this sum is slower. An alternative is to turn the set of node objects into a numpy index array and use it on a numpy array of weights. If you are frequently adding nodes to the graph you will need to recreate the weight array.
Really, that depends on what you think is fun. Biggest example I can think of is large scale game development. Python just doesn't cut it there.
Web development or game design 
Alright, I've been having a play. Had no luck. But one of the coders at work has agreed to have a look with me tomorrow. Fingers crossed. I am curious, I assume I need to set random starting states for each of the nodes. How would I do this. I assume I have to assign a value at t_0 = -1 + 2 * (random.randn()). Also, a later part of the question asks me to place a super-node at the centre of the lattice. Do you know how I do I assign a state/function to a specific node (mine will be a 21 x 21 matric, so it will be node 219 (as graph starts at node 0)? 
Alright, thanks!
&gt;I am curious, I assume I need to set random starting states for each of the nodes. How would I do this. I assume I have to assign a value at t_0 = -1 + 2 * (random.randn()). You can assign a random state with the random module. Assuming you are using the random module from python and have a dict of the state you can initState = {node : random.randn() for node in graph.nodes()} &gt;Also, a later part of the question asks me to place a super-node at the centre of the lattice. Do you know how I do I assign a state/function to a specific node (mine will be a 21 x 21 matric, so it will be node 219 (as graph starts at node 0)? I am not sure what you mean with this. Do you mean that this 'special' node does not change? Or has some properties that are different from the other nodes?
"flatten the matrices" would loose too many info, no ?
Python sometimes depends on some c or c++ for hardcore calculations (like in facial recognition), because python on its own is quite slow. The library you're installing depends on some binary which will get compiled. You need to install cmake for windows or it won't be able to do it. There may be other problems, look up if there are any binary dependencies for facial_recognition. 
Python on for macOS is more than just an application. It also installs a framework. If you want to completely remove all custom installed Python versions, delete `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework`, plus the files in /Applications. Then you can do a clean install. Note that macOS also comes with its own version of 2.7.10, so even after you clean up the ones you installed, you'll see you can still run a 2.7 shell. Don't remove this one (stored in `/System/Library/Frameworks`) or you'll break the OS.
Here is some code that may help import networkx as nx from numpy import random, tanh, zeros from matplotlib.pyplot import subplots, colorbar def update(graph, state, func): newState = {} for node in graph.nodes(): newState\[node\] = func(node, state) return newState import networkx as nx from numpy import random, tanh, zeros from matplotlib.pyplot import subplots, colorbar def update(graph, state, func): newState = {} for node in graph.nodes(): newState[node] = func(node, state) return newState # define some update function func = lambda x, state: \ tanh( state[x] + sum(state[xi] for xi in graph.neighbors(x)) + random.randn()) # define graph init state graph = nx.path_graph(5) state = {node : random.randn() for node in graph.nodes()} T = 10 # simulation steps results = zeros((T, graph.number_of_nodes())) for ti in range(T): state = update(graph, state, func) # update state results[ti] = list(state.values()) # append # plot results fig, ax = subplots() h = ax.imshow(results.T) ax.set_ylabel('Node i'); ax.set_xlabel('Time [t]') colorbar(h, ax = ax, label = 'value') &amp;#x200B;
Say you turn 0 0 into 1 0 and 0 0 into 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 Flattened, that would be: 0000 into 1000 and 0001 into 0000 Seen as bits, the distance is 8 in the first case, 1 the second. Seen as grey code, both distances are 1. The positional information is preserved because the transformation is bijective, just the way you display the information is changed. Flatten was meant as [[0,0],[1,0]] -&gt; [0,0,1,0] 
It is a node with the same function as the rest but it has far more influence over its neighbours. Basically where the other nodes will be worth between -1 and 1, it'll be between -20 and 20. In the end I will put up to four of these nodes across the whole network. (Although this is due in three days and I seriously doubt I'll get that far in to the questions). :( And I figure I need to start with -1 and add 2*random.randn ... otherwise I won't start with any negative values... all the people will be happy (I'm assuming +'s are happy, -'s have been given a coding assignment they can't do and are depressed as shit). 
May I ask how you do that so quickly? 
Very cool answer, thanks! I do remember studying prolog a bit in one class in college - it's definitely an unique case!

It may not be the exact code I need, but I can certainly make it work. I really like how it maps out each node across time. I had no idea how I was going to do that, my plan was just to print out the network and take periodic snapshots ... this is really nice. I now just need to play around with the variables, add extra super-nodes, and then repeat the whole thing for a different network topology. I think I'll be good from here. Thank you again. (If I get stuck on anything I may be back for more help). 
The proposal to call new BDFLs "the GUIDO" is pretty funny.
Client side web programming should be done in javascript or a language that was explicitly designed to compile/transpile to JS (e.g., typescript, dart, coffeescript, or at least ES6/ES7 transpiled down to JS all browsers accept). Doing it in python (while possible because people have written transpilers) will be clunky and less fun, especially if you run into any issues you want to debug. Also certain types of problems are easier to do in other languages. E.g., using a functional language like haskell to do certain project euler problems (see [learn you a haskell for great good](http://learnyouahaskell.com)). Once you wrap your head around a fully lazy language with good tail call optimizations and using functional program you can solve problems in really elegant ways.
Alright, so I didn't do it your way, but I got a function working! Mine seems a lot simpler yet works, but I am sure that my shorter way will prove to have some holes. Thanks for all your help!

Rust is really... fun is the wrong word here. I guess a better word is "empowering". I really like writing stuff in Rust because it lets me do crazy things and know the compiler has my back. It's so, so much easier to write heavily threaded code when you have what's basically a formal proof that it doesn't do anything stupid.

Second this. This book provides a lot of mini projects. It definitely helped me learn Python and enjoyed learning it. 
Thank you guys, however, in my environment the only command I can run to elevate is 'sudo su -'. No other sudo command or syntax is allowed.
My goal is to have "smokeping"-like application layer that presents time series data. I've finished the database backend of my scraper, db/cache and now moving on to the app layer. My big trouble is presenting the data to a webpage, as I'm not quite sure where to start. I've completed corey schafer's django course, however I am not still confident with my understanding of Django. I'm thinking that there is so much going on with django that I'm not used to. Is something else that lets me build up the app layer in small steps? This is my third time starting a project because I see a dataset that interests me, it feels like I'm just cleaning and hoarding data basically.

r/kenm
Im really sorry to bother you again... I just have 1 more question. How can I now make it so it also displays the name of the list in which the number is bigger. For example if: list1 = [4, 1, 2] list2 = [2, 5, 2] And now it should display 4 (the biggest difference) and also list2 because 5 is bigger then 1. I did it but it does for every pair of numbers so It says list1 and list2 multiple times.
I've been diving into rust lately; it's easy enough both to compile to WASM and to stick python bindings on it so we're planning to migrate some of the heavier algorithmic stuff in our data analysis web app to use it - then the frontend and backend can both be using the same implementations at high speed.

A good source for people trying to learn! 
Have you (seen this)[https://duckduckgo.com/?q=instagram+api+follower+count]?
No, I haven't, thank you though. Can you explain what is it?
Do you mean similar patterns within each matrix or similar patterns shared by multiple matrices? Or are you looking for patterns within the 3D matrix of the ordered 2D matrices?
The pythonic way is to have a single function accept all reasonable types as long as the API makes sense. I would generally not name variables in a function name/parameter after their type, but give them a name that doesn't rely on it's type. For example, if I had a `Dog` and `Cat` class and wrote a polymorphic function that could feed either, it would be something like `feed(animal)` and not `feed(dog_or_cat)`, even if there's no explicit class hierarchy of Animal that Dog and Cat inherit from. Or if I had a function that said wrote stuff to a log that could accept anything that could be turned to a string, I'd write something like (really would use `logging` module) def write_to_log(message): message_str = str(message) with open(path_to_log, 'a') as wf: wf.write(message_str) That is the name the parameter after what it is, `message_str` only having the type at the end to indicate that it has explicitly cast.
It's LGPL3
Thanks.
Thanks. I was really focused on disambiguating, but the log example made me realize it's more common than I thought.

If you have any non small typical enterprise project with all kinds of problems, nothing is fun at all, but python becomes even a pain. With java and eclipse (for example) you can refactor shitty code an order of magnitude faster.
Is this hourly or per project? What's your budget?
Haha yes I was just experimenting with having a global changing state (weather) and each person have an internal changing state (hunger), and then interacting with people based on those states.
Yeah there's very few programming languages that are just eons different in how they work from Python, Prolog is one of those few.

You'll probably have better luck over at /r/learnpython**.** I'd recommend reposting this question there. 
Thank you to help me to clarify. I mean : similar patterns shared by multiple matrices. One pattern per 2D matrix. I suppose there should get same patterns with all those matrices.

This is for demonstration purposes only) `max_diff, larger_list = max((abs(a-b), ['list2', 'list1'][a&gt;b]) for a, b in zip(list1, list2))`

That's pretty on topic if you ask me. Thanks for the resource!
That sounds like what's happening. I tried your pipe and it handled the error much better. I'm not sure if this is the approach I want to take, but i think filtering for some sort of sequence on top of what I'm doing may be expensive if I'm searching a lot of files recursively. Thanks for the tip this definitely gets me closer.
Looks good. But, using docstring for other usage rather than documentation is really confusing. What do I gain by doing it that way, rather than other methods like adding decorator, for example.
I come from C and at least over there IO is usually the bottleneck with stuff like this, so filtering of some sort will, even in python, probably not cause any performance problems. After all, to be safe from it messing up your terminal too badly it might be enough to remove all `\033`s, since iirc that's what escape sequences always start with. (Might not be enough but at least a kot better than previously)

that makes sense, looking at the code all of the regex searching is handled by one small function, if i can find a way to handle / ignore the characters there, it will be very easy to fix, ill just have to dig in the documentation, thanks again.
The first thing you need to do is go read the Turtle Docs [https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/turtle.html?highlight=turtle#module-turtle](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/turtle.html?highlight=turtle#module-turtle) As far as how to do it, I would probably go with the Google logo because I think it would be easier to do. Basically break down the shape into 4 x quad/quarter circles, red, yellow, green blue, then draw a white circle in the middle, and then a blue rectangle on top of it. So for the red and yellow slice, something like this. `import turtle` `t1 = turtle.Pen()` `t1.hideturtle() # turn off the arrow` `t1.color("red", "red") # pen color / fill color` `t1.begin_fill()` `t1.left(135)` [`t1.circle`](https://t1.circle)`(100,90) #draw a 90 degree arc of a circle with a radius of 100` `t1.left(90)` `t1.forward(100)` `t1.left(90)` `t1.forward(100)` `t1.end_fill()` `# position to start yellow quarter circle` `t1.left(90)` `t1.circle(100,90)` `t1.color("yellow", "yellow")` `t1.begin_fill()` `t1.circle(100,90)` `t1.left(90)` `t1.forward(100)` `t1.left(90)` `t1.forward(100)` `t1.end_fill()` `input('press any key')` You are going to have to do a bit a work moving it around where you want and positioning it, as well as figuring how how it is drawing things. There is probably a better way then the above however. It might be useful to use these functions as well: `.penup()` `.setposition(posxy)` `.pendown()` &amp;#x200B; **Seriously though read the docs. I don't use this library and there may be a WAY easier ways to draw those shapes and sizes then manual pen drawing and pen rotation.** &amp;#x200B;
Take a look at the pygame tutorial on pythonprogramming.net, it's good!
namedtuple or dataclasses
I am working on a library that finds a smaller image inside of a larger image (often the screen), because for some reason I couldn‚Äôt find a library that did that in an hour of looking
I recommend learning python! It's a great programming language, and much more popular than whatever it is you're doing.
What's an `xrange` /s
you could subclass dict and implement `__getattr__` and `__setattr__` to add dot operator access of keys

or recordtype (depending on your version).
Maths https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapdoor_function
You can't actually reverse it though, right? You can just take guesses at the original text until you get something that generates the same hash. Which may or may not actually be the original text.
Hashing is a recursive process that employs the modulo operator usually. Modulo is really easy to do but tough to undo because basically you have to test every combination. You just have to sit there and crank. And recursively? Then if you know the answer after a few layers of adding and modulo-ing, that gives you essentially no information about the input and the problem explodes in computational intensity. To the point where you might as well just brute force the hash function as a whole than try to break any one part. 
If you know the key you can undo it. Again, it is just extremely processing heavy to try and undo it from scratch. It would not be logical (and hence not proper maths) if it was impossible to undo a function.
hello fellow lazy programmer. You can use (lambda:0) to create a dummy anonymous function, which can be treated like an object, but can be modified unlike object(). So the first line would be: PIT\_List.insert((lambda:0),1) &amp;#x200B; But this seems cheesy. Most likely namedtuples are what you want and you don't really want to have "blank" classes but instead have well defined classes with proper class structure. Python lets you get away with what you're doing due to ducktyping but more structured code generally helps you in the long run as your code gets larger and more complex.
Only uuid4 is random.
The fun thing about creating something in Javascript/html is you can host it somewhere and show all your non-techie friends. It's more difficult to send your python program to your mom to try.
There are plenty of functions without an inverse in 'valid maths'. In fact most hash functions don't have an inverse due to the fact that the domain is larger than the codomain. That is, the output of the function has a fixed size, like a string of a certain length, but the input can be any object. The amount of different objects that you can input to the function is larger than the amount of possible output strings. So, some objects that are different will result in the same hash output. This is called a [collision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_(computer_science)). So given an output hash, it's impossible to determine which object was used as input - at best, you can determine all the different objects that could have been the input. This is comparable to sqrt(4) having both -2 and 2 as answers. Note that this is a known property of hashes and is not a problem of hash functions, it just determines the situations in which they are useful.
As my mother used to say, "if they encouraged you to jump off a ten-story building, would you do it?" 
Regular hash functions are designed to quickly take a large piece of information and produce a small piece of information that is usually different from the one produced by a different large piece of information. At best you can come up with a *possible* input that produces a certain output, but there are always multiple possibilities. Crytographic hash functions are like that but also try to make it as hard as possible to figure out *any* of those possibilities.
no problem! feel free to ask if you have any questions
 for i in range(5): num = random.randint(1, 70) # Ensure number is unique before saving to set. if num not in my_numbers: my_numbers.add(num) continue # Try again else: i -= 1 continue This code is a bit strange. First of all, you don‚Äôt need to call `continue`. The loop continues automatically. `continue` is only used if you want to start the next iteration and skip the rest of the body. Furthermore, a `while` loop would make more sense here.
You're right, it went through several iterations as I kept discovering more quirks. I wasn't submitting it for peer review or anything, just a fun simulator to show people how ridiculous it is to play the lottery.
Wow this thread is blowing my mind. Someone should compile a list of random API endpoints to fuck around with.
Great idea and a neat little project! I just wanted to help to improve your Python skills ;) You should also look into [random.sample/(/)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.sample). `random.sample(range(1, 70), 5)` will give you the random numbers you need.
Does this force them to be unique? This could greatly simplify the whole script lol
Take a look at the documentation. That‚Äôs exactly what it does. &gt; Return a k length list of unique elements chosen from the population sequence 
So basically, we used the Lora Feather shield, as well as the NRF24L01+ module (on the rpi 3 nodes) to have these devices communicate with each other. Then, we wrote a web server using flask and socketio that was running on each node to provide a restful and a socket connection through the adhoc network on the pis, so whatever device that was connected to them could post or receive data to/from the network. Here's our [devpost](https://devpost.com/software/relief-mesh-zhp5yu) submission We were just learning about networking and had close to no experience in most of what we did. Also, everything was done under 36 hours as well as the code, so if you wanna take a look at it keep in mind that I rushed through most of the parts and it might look that great. Eitherway, I apologize in advance.
A hash transforms a possibly infinite set of inputs to a fixed set of outputs. To reverse this, you would need a function that took a single hash and returned all of the (possibly infinite) inputs that could have resulted in that hash. One of those will be the thing that was the original input, but how would you know which of the many possibilities was the right one? A hash function intentionally loses information so that you can't easily get back to the original. One way to help determine the original input is to apply other constraints to the possible inputs. For example, only certain phrases are proper, meaningful English, and only certain data would fit a given file format or other protocol. So though there may be many or even infinite possible inputs, there may be few or only a single one that would be valid given the constraints of the context in which it was used.
When someone clearly posts something for fun and an "expert" on the topic asks why they did it that way... Thanks for the post! More than one way to skin a... ü§™
Removing dead code is always a good idea. I'm also not using `generate_random_ticket`. I started with just generating a complete random drawing, and then figured it might be interesting to post a more elaborate solution and hear if anyone had some further ideas. &amp;#x200B; I think defining sets that way is a habit of mine. I'm not sure why, but I think might be due to it being easier to not accidentally confuse it with a dictionary when glancing over code quickly. Also, I typically prefer functions to be lazy. In this case, I was originally thinking I could lazily filter out or modify the drawing keys or weights. &amp;#x200B; Outside of allowing for providing type hints to keys, values, items, etc., are there other benefits to using the typing module over just the class? &amp;#x200B;
The first part of your explanation is inaccurate. 1) Modulo isn't necessary for a hash function: `math.floor(math.log(n))` is a valid hash function, but doesn't use mod. Looking at cryptographic hashes, most use modular arithmetic, but I don't know if that's actually part of the security. 2) The reason mod is impossible to undo is because many numbers `n` satisfy the equation `n % p = r`. It's fairly easy to find a number that satisfies it: `(r + p * n for n in range(N))` will generate `N` of them, but it's impossible to know which one is correct. Also, 
I have modified the gist to be greatly simplified now. Yet, still works exactly the same, and faster!
I have updated this to be much faster/simpler thanks to the advice given by MrJKeating! Simply save the script and type: python3 &lt;script_location&gt;
Admittedly, it was very sloppy. It has now been made more "pythonic". Plot twist: I'm actually a C++ engineer.
I'm not sure if this is that serious sir. 
#WhoCares ? You were just having fun. 
Been working with python on clusters you probably haven't even imagined exists - python is just as capable as java when it comes to big projects. Maybe you're just a bad Python developer?
&gt; Client side web programming should be done in javascript or a language that was explicitly designed to compile/transpile to JS (e.g., typescript, dart, coffeescript, or at least ES6/ES7 transpiled down to JS all browsers accept). Yeah but none of those are _fun_ languages, well at least in my opinion. I've been unfortunate enough to have to work with javascript extensively and it's not an enjoyable experience especially when you know you could solve this in Python, or almost anything else for that matter, quicker and in a more elegant, beautiful way. Dart however looks quite interesting but I'm reluctant to touch anything google. Thanks for the suggestion though!
This is a really interesting project. Very well done!
Thank you :)
Okay sir.
You can iterate through the Dataframe by index as a last resort. It's better to use apply(), or pretty much anything else over Python loops, but: for i in df.index: a = df.loc[i, 'f1'] df.loc[i, 'f1'] = api(a)

I'll give you that numpy float64 being 10x slower is actually interesting (and I'd not have guessed that much slower) and I'll tentatively agree that it's a pitfall since you're right that it's possible to return a numpy datatype without realising it. I think you can write a whole blog post on this, perhaps even examining it in detail and discussing why it's so much slower than a primitive. However, the real issue here is usage of `float64`, a type you'd have to stumble upon very deliberately. ‚ûú ~ python3 -m timeit -s "y = [x for x in range(100000)]" "sum(y)" 1000 loops, best of 3: 690 usec per loop ‚ûú ~ python3 -m timeit -s "import numpy as np; y = [np.float(i) for i in range(100000)]" "sum(y)" 1000 loops, best of 3: 421 usec per loop ‚ûú ~ python3 -m timeit -s "import numpy as np; y = [np.float64(i) for i in range(100000)]" "sum(y)" 100 loops, best of 3: 4.25 msec per loop ‚ûú ~ python3 -m timeit -s "import numpy as np; y = [np.float32(i) for i in range(100000)]" "sum(y)" 100 loops, best of 3: 10 msec per loop So now numpy floats are faster than inbuilt floats (also something I didn't expect tbh). Your examination of this pitfall is limited in the best of cases. The only time I've ever specified float accuracy in numpy has been GPU programming. Again as I stated before if you wrote a post on how the various types behaved and why there is such a discrepancy, that'd be great, as it stands you're throwing around statements with limited research and no explanation. And finally, I'll give you that it's possible to mix numpy datatypes if you're not careful (though I've proved it doesn't matter), it's very odd to see the mix happen. For graphs, I'd probably not use numpy at all if it was sparse since the array overheads would be very annoying, and if it was dense, I'd represent with an adjacency matrix in numpy. 
This is similarly frustrating in how it perpetuates fear of regexes. Machine-generated regexes are worse than those made by hand and harder to maintain. In the example they show: tester = (verbal_expression. start_of_line(). find('http'). maybe('s'). find('://'). maybe('www.'). anything_but(' '). end_of_line() ) And that generates this regex: `^(http)(s)?(\:\/\/)(www\.)?([^\ ]*)$` That regex is harder to read than it needs to be because of all the unnecessary parentheses and escaping. The extra parentheses are also extra capture groups that will slow things down. The equivalent handmade regex: `^https?://(www\.)?\S*$`. You can even use the `re.VERBOSE` flag and add comments and whitespace. This lets you construct the same sort of commented, broken out regexes that this package allows you to do: urlpattern = re.compile(r""" ^ # Beginning of line https? # "http" with optional "s" :// # Plain ol' :// (www\.)? # Optional "www." at the beginning of hostname \S* # Any number of non-whitespace characters $ # End of the line """, re.VERBOSE ) Regexes really aren't scary if you take some time to learn them and comment what you need to. Don't learn an add-on package to do better what Python lets you do anyway.
This is great! Do you have a projected range the mesh network could reach? 
working as intended? http://prntscr.com/l9pawj
The function call that failed [copies data from the device to the host](http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/2_3/toolkit/docs/online/group__CUMEM_g7e0dc519d430790de8f4793cbafe3e15.html), so you‚Äôre probably running out of ram somewhere, or else have hit upon a bug in Numba.
Ruby is probably just as fun and easy I would guess.
Hmm. My guess is that your image doesn't have an alpha channel. For a workaround, you might just add one, but I'll definitely try to handle that better in the next version. 
Yeah. I just tried with a random .png image that I had around just to test it and found this bug funny to report. Happy fixing!
Well that‚Äôs the best case scenario, I believe with the right weather condition, low amount of noise and straight line of sight. However, I saw some people stress testing these modules for extremely longer ranges like ~100km on the internet. So I believe there are work arounds such as having some bridge nodes on floating balloons or elevated locations to increase or at least use the max range.
Thank you :) So we didn‚Äôt had any background knowledge or prior research before the event, everything was mostly what we came up with during that time and might not be the best solution. Regarding routing, currently the nodes broadcast the messages to every other node on the network and this only happens once as each message gets a new uid as it enters the network and each node only processes it once, this is done to reduce redundancy.
How far have you gotten? What parts are you stuck on? I'd definitely start by doing a python tutorial. Leaning a second language goes pretty fast.
You‚Äôre going to have to do it yourself, because Python is not just matlab with different syntax, it‚Äôs a different language. I think it‚Äôs a far better language than matlab. For one thing, we have Scipy, [which includes a function to calculate the hamming distance for you](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance.hamming.html), and you can find many pure-python examples of the calculation online, [such as these on SP](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31007054/hamming-distance-between-two-binary-strings-not-working)
What type of api is it? HTTP?
Step 1. Use proper formatting for readability. 
It sounds like the round trip time is negligible compared to the backend sorting its shit out and the actual download - might picking a small time increment and parallelising the downloads with async be easiest? You can also adaptively change the increment - pick a maximum time window, then for every window where that fails, split it in half and request the two smaller windows, and so on and so on. As an example: 1. Set up a threadpoolexecutor which takes a start and end time, and returns the data 2. Submit intervals from midnight to midnight for all the days you're interested in 3. Use some combination of `wait`, `as_completed`, and/or while loops to take failed intervals, bisect them, and submit them back into the executor 4. Eventually you should have everything.
Fixed it, my bad.
Does pygame 1or 2 do iOS / Android stuff? I know things like kivy intentionally target mobile, but I've always assumed pygame had requirements that limited it to desktop OS's with a more traditional python install.
Definitely! They are a little too expensive for a college student haha, but you definitely get what you pay for.
Wow, I actually didn't know that one, which is very surprising to me, though with 3 monitors, full screen shot usually is not what I want. I was disappointed with snipping tool on Windows 10 enough that I now run green shot all the time and love it. I regularly need to screen shot a lot during WebEx / Skype style conferences at work. Sure, they'll send you the slides they say... 
I get similar results on my machine. If I run `type(np.float(3))` I get `&lt;class 'float'&gt;` which is just the built in float type. If I run `type(np.array([1.0])[0])` I get `&lt;class 'numpy.float64'&gt;`. So running `np.float` doesn't give you the same thing as `np.array` even without a type argument, which is a more common way of building numpy datatypes in my experience. What is really confusing is that this should mean the first and second example you give should have the same performance, but they don't. Could this be an arena allocation/locality thing? For my use case, sparsity or density doesn't have much to do with the issue. The weights come from something that has little to do with the graph structure essentially, but are attributed to nodes, and are computationally expensive to calculate. The weights are best computed with numpy at the moment.
Yeah I've always considered numpy's vectorized matrix operations as being essentially parallel or without any looping... like 2*Array doesn't loop over the array in my head, it just happens via black magic array math code. I guess all the magic array things have loops at the lower C / Fortran / assembly / llvm / GPU level, I just never want to see them!
I'll admit that opening large projects or projects that import multiple large libraries (like numpy, matplotlib, pandas, pyqt, vtk, opengl, etc) cause pycharm to do a lot of churning just refreshing the skeletons or the inspections or whatever. Full reindexing takes like 10- 30 minutes sometimes, and it's effectively disabled during that time. I love PyCharm because it adds value, but I can't call it fast.
Oh, I think I know: something in the inner loop is causing a copy of the array to be made instead of operating on the array in-place. I suggest going back to standard Numpy on one core and see how much you can get from changing how you call Numpy. Instead of using vectorize, see if you can do everything with in-place Numpy operations. [This PyCon talk may be helpful. ](https://youtu.be/EEUXKG97YRw)
or x, _* = (1,2,3) now the underscore captures 'everything else' because maybe you don't even care how many there are. scipy.linregress is one I do like this sometimes, because I might not want all 5 outputs.
Hey just wanted to say congrats on the win! I was the person at the next clean table, with one other partner. It's awesome to see you made a reddit post about this lol-- will be rooting for you and F at the next hackathon (probably HackPrinceton?)
Reads a CSV into a dictionary, so like pandas-lite?
Tell your boss that you invented a standard format that they can use and that you'd like to host a technical interchange meeting to standardize and modernize the shipping manifests to save time for everyone. You can't be the only beneficiary of such a change. You could provide the shipping companies a GUI for data entry, lol... ok, maybe that's too far... 
The Python 2 equivalent of a Python 3 `range`
...and I love PyQt5... there are enough examples and whatnot that I happily recommend PyQt to folks. Any GUI tool has a learning curve and I feel like PyQt has the reward that the sky is the limit on what you can do. simple UIs aren't difficult either, and for me, PyQt is compatible with a lot of scientific libraries for plotting and whatnot, and can even be used from within a Jupyter Notebook (maybe others can too, I don't know).
When you were researching this did you come across the bat kernel module for mesh wifi networking. I tried to get it working a few years ago but couldn't even after compiling it into a kernel it wouldn't chooch.
Ok, but what makes it slow is Python. Indexing the subsequent C array is actually faster. And the idea behind numpy is to think outside the box and avoid indexing. If you really need complex "non aligned" indexing, C or Cython come to the rescue...
If you like PyQt5, check out (my) r/https://build-system.fman.io :-)
I've bookmarked this before, and I can't remember why I might've passed the last time I saw this, but I'm nearing first release of a new tool, so I'm goin to take a hard look again. I'm currently using pyinstaller + pyupdater + Inno Setup to handle things and I've debated about switching to pyinataller + squirrel + NSIS, but if your thing is easier than my current nightmare for my last tool, then I'll give it a go. Can I customize the win.spec file for pyinstaller? I have a LOT of dependencies and data files to include.
 If you want to web scrape, go do it. I fail to see how googling for non-password protected data is illegal. I think your time would be better spent studying though. I doubt your profs are all that lazy.
Really nicely done. Could I use this to capture and tx/rx a current sensor reading from a flat text across the mesh to the webserver? Is there a hardware/software build guide floating around? 
I find working with `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` in Clojure to be satisfying in a way that's analogous to writing list comprehensions in Python. They don't necessarily let you do things that list comprehensions can't, though. The main domain Clojure has that Python doesn't is transpilation to Javascript. There are transpilers for Python, but they're not as established‚ÄîClojurescript is a major runtime, similar to PyPy. Similarly, going through The Little Schemer and solving a bunch of problems with recursion was fun, even if I could solve the same problems with comprehensions or iteration in Python.
[Glob](docs.python.org/3.5/library/glob.html) is part of the standard library and really useful when it comes to search files on your system. Since you are familiar with the data science stuff, you probably had at some point to grab hundreds of .jpg or .csv file in a program. That is where glob really shines
You can get cheap LoRa modules on aliexpress :)
I happened to be [monitoring my network traffic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13080965/47061936-988dfe00-d188-11e8-8d45-b8d02cf3646f.png) and found out that the [howdoi](https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi) utility doesn't cache it's answers - in fact, the caching is completely broken. So.... I fixed it! :D Then I found out that caching offers only a small performance increase for a significant slowdown on the first query. Because the majority of queries would presumably be different, this makes caching ..... just not worth it. :( Moral of the story: Don't make premature optimizations You can read the full investigation here: https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi/issues/213

Not sure about your lottery, but in ours the order of the numbers is not taken into account. Sorting the sets first would take number order out of the equation.

Congrats bro, I really like using Python. I made 4 apps with kivy and published on google play store, I really enjoy the coding process but packaging process is really hurts my head here one of them, if you enjoy you can check also others, I add really good stuffs like widget animations [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.solowar.wordtellsu](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.solowar.wordtellsu)
Have you tried working with pygame-sdl2? That's pygame, but on sdl2 rather than sdl1. It lets you target mobile devices too. It's how the Ren'Py Visual Novel engine runs on mobile.
I am still working on it. But I will post it to r/python when finished
This really isn't "news about python", so belongs in /r/learnpython.
Would `isalpha` be a builtin function like `max` or `list`? Or would you have to import it in from `string` for example before use? Can you see a scenario when you'd want to check if an object 'isalpha' and it not be a string of characters? To me the decision makes total sense, it's a method that's only really applicable to strings, and it's available to you without effort whenever a string is about. (All that said, maybe I would make it a property rather than a method so it'd be `"Hello World".isalpha`).
The method described the string. It doesn't DO something to it.
the guy was mocking you you idiot. he was making fun of you. 
Ah cheers haha, yeah imma do that next time
 This is very helpful, thank you. So basically, instead of recursively breaking up failed attempts, make it so a failure leaves a trace that an iterative loop would detect and split in two. Thanks!
That's hilarious
Ever posted anything useful? Give it a try, you will feel different.
The full desktop approach is interesting. Could you give more details about your stack ? Which open source components are you using for the virtual environments ? I didn't find any reference to [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/). Is it intentional ? 
Im sure there are a lot of variables, like how many devices are connected and communicating. What a fun problem 
Pygame-SDL2 sounds like Pygame 2. Pygame 2 is literally just Pygame on SDL 2, but it‚Äôs still in development. I‚Äôll check out Pygame-SDL2 since I‚Äôve been anticipating Pygame 2 for a while. :D

That's pretty cool, but why did you choose to use Python?
The costs mentioned in the devpost do not seem to line up. It says a total cost of around $25, but the Feather alone is $35 from Adafruit. I was surprised that it could be done so inexpensively, because I had researched the costs for a project of my own, and could not find radios that cheep. Still an interesting project.
Arduino is programmed in c/c++. The board doesn‚Äôt do interpreted languages like python. You can communicate with the arduino via usb using python, but I would learn the basics of arduino programming first. 
thanks.
Your problem could be that (you are using a Mac)
Perhaps he should use the Raspberry Pi instead. It offers plently more oppertunities and supports many programming languages (specifically Python)
I lost about 2 week's worth of commits and now my current build isn't working. # shoot me
Yup, I was just searching to get myself a couple of them :D
I haven't really worked with pandas yet so I can't really compare it to that, but yeah that's exactly what it does. import csv with open('my_file.csv', 'r') as f: dict_reader = csv.DictReader(f) return [dic for dic in dict_reader] That will give you a list of dictionaries where each dictionary is a row from the csv and the keys are the column headers. They're technically OrderedDict's rather than regular dictionaries (I believe that's to ensure that the right headers get coupled with the right values), but in terms of iterating through them and pulling values and all that they work the same.
So I‚Äôve been using Python for a year now and doing almost everything with it haha. I used it because I had experience with its modules and didn‚Äôt had to learn them again, and also since we had to run it on raspberry pis and i believe python is the easiest way to go.
You might be using a different interpreter than the one where neovim package has been installed. For instance you mention using pip3 and then pip, this could mean python 2 for the latter.
&gt; why it would be "Hello World!".isalpha() would have been designed instead of isalpha("Hello World!"). it is both &gt;&gt;&gt; "Hello World!".isalpha() False &gt;&gt;&gt; str.isalpha("Hello World!") False in fact, the former is nothing but a syntactic sugar around the latter, with the additional guarantee that you can't give nonsense values for `self` param. That said the method syntax indicates that the method is specific for the type, while function-like form would indicate generic nature of the function, which clearly is not the case with isalpha that makes sense only for strings. 
Yeah, these problems never stop to amaze me.
Yes you could use something like this. Unfortunately, we built everything by ourselves so I‚Äôm not exactly sure if there is a build guide for something similar or not. But ill consider creating a build guide in the future, if school work allows me to :D
That is true. However, I do support learning arduino and other MCUs like it because they provide the ability to transfer a project from the prototyping board to a real embedded system by flashing to a single ic with minimal extra hardware. It‚Äôs a rewarding thing to do and a good project for young makers/hackers/engineers. As a side note, I believe the teensy can be programmed with micropython, which is a compiled flavor of python, iirc. 
So we wrote everything by ourselves and did not use any preexisting protocol/software 
thats awsome!!
Is it considered poor form to substitute the MAC address or namespace with some other bit of information? Seems like the privacy concerns over UUID1 would be settled if I used a random integer instead. Are there any additional concerns I'm not considering?
thanks for pointing that out. \`$ pip3 list\` shows the same output here
lol
Makes sense, raspberry pis have also seen to been really good with python. I actually use NodeJS myself and never really used python
Hi, the desktop is based on Docker. About Jupyter, it's used in our Machine Learning courses. We optimized it for our environment. Here is a tutorial for you:[https://labex.io/courses/labex-machine-learning-environment-tutorial](https://labex.io/courses/labex-machine-learning-environment-tutorial).
Wow, that's impressive. Good job. You making it open source?

Try setting the attribute on an already existing Excel instance. So for example: &gt;&gt;&gt; app = xw.App() &gt;&gt;&gt; app.screen_updating=False &gt;&gt;&gt; app.screen_updating False
Also, Depending on support from the underlying platform, uuid1 may or may not return a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù UUID. A safe UUID is one which is generated using synchronization methods that ensure no two processes can obtain the same UUID.
-___- you were not supposed to see that. Haha
Is it fair to assume that this would have horrible performance in a mountainous area with limited line of sight?
Then is there no way to interact with arduino using python?
Well I haven‚Äôt test it at that condition, but here‚Äôs my assumption. It definitely cannot pass signals through mountains, however, the elevation could be used as a benefit of having elevated nodes that would help pass the data through. Also there are other options for such case, such as having balloons that carry nodes. 
Well the code is available on github, if you open the devpost link on my first comment, there is a link to github. However, the code is quite messy right now, I will try to go over and clean or rewrite it when I get the time.
Hey again, I just noticed that weight isn't what I want here for my super-nodes. These nodes are the ones with more influence, but not because it is connected to more nodes, they just have what I'd call a stronger voice. Say my graph is 100 average people in a room. One of them is replaced by a Nobel prize winner, the people around them are now far more likely to take onboard his opinion than others, so he has more influence in this regard. It isn't an average person being replaced by a really popular one. It's the same network but some nodes are more powerful than others getting those around them to follow. 
FORMAT YOUR CODE
&gt;These nodes are the ones with more influence, but not because it is connected to more nodes, they just have what I'd call a stronger voice. Ah right. So then the idea would be to select a node that already exists and update the weights of that node to the other nodes def upgradeSuperNode(node, weight, graph): ''' Upgrade node to a super node by adjusting the weight to the neigbhors ''' for neighbor in graph.neighbors(node): graph[node][neighbor]['weight'] = weight return graph &amp;#x200B;
A hash of all the data for a given site gives you a quick way of detecting any change. You also only need to read the hash value each time you scrape the site, rather than all extracted data from the last scrape. When you detect a hash change, read the old data and report on changes however you need to. Depending on the data you‚Äôre looking at, you might want to look at normalising after scraping to prevent false positive change reports. For example, squash duplicate white space along with leading/trailing. You might also want to look at lower casing before hashing. 
It is not a syntactic sugar. It means something else. In the first case you look up a method first in the slots of the concrete object, and only then you look it up in the type object associated to the concrete object. In the second case you go directly for the type object. Now, whether what you say is true about methods will depend on what exactly do you mean when you say methods... For instance, if you have this: class Spam: pass spam = Spam() spam.egg = lambda: print('Hello') spam.egg() # prints Hello Spam.egg(spam) # error
what did you code with it?
You can. You‚Äôd just need to use a module like pyserial. That‚Äôs communication between the computer and the arduino via usb. The arduino still needs to be programmed tho. 
`range` returns a list in Python 2 and it turns out it is not a smart idea.

Could you tell me more about these balloons? Keywords and phrases I could research myself would be useful. All I know about them is that they aren't the typical party balloons.
Yes, I know. Even less smart an idea than writing tutorial code in python 2 today.

Working on improving my GitHub Enterprise wrapper for creating releases/tags for jenkins usage, working pretty nice so far, it's available on github :)
You really shouldn't use regex to attempt to parse or extract information from XML/HTML. Its really not the appropriate tool for a number of reasons including among them: 1. patterns are by default greedy, and so `&lt;tag&gt;left&lt;tag&gt;inner&lt;/tag&gt;right&lt;/tag&gt;` can get recognized as a single `&lt;tag&gt;&lt;/tag&gt;` pair containing `left&lt;tag&gt;inner` as its contents and leaving a lone `right&lt;/tag&gt;` all by its lonesome. 2. It doesn't do even the most cursory validation of the data (just matching opening and closing tags together) and workflows using regex are very susceptible to generating bad html. 3. Its a bitch to deal with attributes on tags which might be optional. and so on. Do yourself a favor and get a proper html/xml parser like beautifulsoup and use that instead.

I‚Äôm a beginner. But I‚Äôm learning OOP and so far I got the basics down with classes and stuff so I want to make something simple to put my knowledge to test. The @ part about a method is confusing 
I can learn Arduino programming it's not problem so. But I still want to be acess with Python into it. Thank you.
Damn can you release the source?
Use this site. Really helpful in testing REGEX &amp;#x200B; [https://regexr.com/](https://regexr.com/)
Almost but not quite. Last line should be - find_all = re.findall(all_sup, open_code) I got a mental red flag when I saw all_sup referenced twice in the same expression
How do you judge the quality of their work?

"consumer weather balloon" might help
ah right, thank you!
I don't even need to click the link to know which thread is being referenced :)
Ah, so the time_low, time_mid, time_high_and_version, and clock_seq_and_reserved_And_clock_seq_low pieces aren't enough to assure you won't get collisions.
Also I advice to use the Keras Documentation.. its the best way to learn it.. shoot me a dm if you want to discuss anything. I am learning this stuff in school right now.. maybe i can help.
You can install PyGame using pip (or pip3 in case of Python 3). More details on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/Pygame/) and the [Getting Started](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) page of PyGame.
By how good their clickbait title is, of course!
I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre storing only required and normalised data, not the entire raw page?
Nice, I give it a look when I'm home. Do you mind if I ask if you use wep to connect the devices or wpa2? Or something else?
