you can compile the string and use inspect to extract the relevant info from the function that gets created. It's not as safe though. ast gives a very low level extraction of information, that may or may not be what you need. 
That worked! Thanks a bunch.
Interesting read. People develop a big fish in a small pond mentality and never grow. 
Give the button to change the visibility a function that either packs or grids the button you want to appear. If you want it to disappear then give a button a function that calls either .pack_forget() or .grid_forget(), depending on which was used to show it.

It truly depends both on what the API you're wrapping looks like as well as how you need to interact with it and the results. For instance, we have a bunch of microservices and using a [declarative style](https://GitHub.com/ithaka/apiron) made configuring them all much easier. That style also follows closely with Django, where we use the services most. If you're mainly interacting with a single API, building a domain-specific wrapper with methods named after endpoints and the like might work best. It all depends.
wath is the wierd f inside your print functions?
Opinion: Start by designing the ideal user interface, then add the wrapper code abstraction underneath it. Otherwise, I find that the patterns of the wrapped API tend to bleed into your API, which may or may not be ideal.
* Nobody knows * pytest (in a virtualenv, maybe created by tox) * pytest or tox (don't bother with the setup.py test verb integration) * not today * for making virtualenvs * doubt it; two different teams are difficult to align * with pycharm * sure (or just activate the virtualenv classically) * you don't, but it helps * because there are too many config files so various tools started supporting reading sections of other tools config files and now we have some 90% compatibility coverage, and _the_ place is setup.cfg (except for some stuff that can't) * because people create Yet Another Implementation all the time, but that doesn't cause the older implementation to ceasing being valuable, functional, documented, used, and setuptools provides at minimum the setup() function in your setup.py while poetry is useful for dev/publish cycle stuff * egg is deprecated by wheel * easyinstall is sometimes useful for installing pip (or just use ensurepip.py) but otherwise a relic present on old OS installations ----- Some of this is opinion. All is subject to change every 3 months.

Using state machine on this code can be a candidate for many of the overkill memes you see on r/ProgrammerHumor. All it takes is to mentally run the code or at most take a pen and paper write down the different possibilities and the appropriate actions and it is fairly easy to reduce them into an optimal form.
String format. Instead of doing: "%s", % (something) You can do: f'{something}' (in python 3x) Btw, the code is from one companies codebase.

It isn't your tutorial in particular or these lines in particular. It's that r/python is flooded with daily "tutorials" teaching every hot topic. Search for machine learning or auto-trading or self-driving or voice-activated or 3D printed or whatever The Fad Of The Month is and you'll find links to medium.com with 5 paragraphs and 12 lines of code, half of which are `import` statements. This sub has about 5% useful, informative content and it's exhausting. Sadly I picked one that is actually pretty OK to vent on, so sorry for that. But I wish the mods would limit the flow of shiny, superficial material and make this sub less like a "LEARN HOW TO CODE AND MAKE $$$" gutter.
Thank you for your help. Very insightful. Do you share my opinion that there should be some effort in giving a high level overview of what is the direction? At the moment I am basically unable to develop just because of the time it takes to figure out what I am supposed to do to start developing.

Thank you for the clear explanation!
Sure. But there are many high level overviews attempted and they're all products of a specific point in history and requirements at the time. They'll all be wrong, either immediately or eventually. Removing the old wrong stuff is difficult. What you're proposing sounds nice. Without maintenance of the old docs, it compounds the problem. The solution in that direction isn't creation of a new summary; it is deletion of old attempts. Go for it - first step is to get commit rights to all the git repos and blogs and such. Or just relearn everything every 3-9 months. Or just pick some Best Practice you liked in 2014 and use that until it no longer works. That's my plan.
I also wrote a downloader for that site.

Start it and it'll fetch an image every 5 seconds.
yeah it's been 5 hours and i still can't figure out the pythonic way to do it.
Well, when I say user interface, I'm thinking of it from a Python API. These should remain relatively stable and breaking changes should be denoted by major versions. In the case of a GUI, there should be a strong separation of concerns and follow [the dependency rule](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).
&gt; Or just relearn everything every 3-9 months. can't do &gt; Or just pick some Best Practice you liked in 2014 and use that until it no longer works. That's my plan. I am trying to get up to speed to the best practices today, but I am getting more and more annoyed about how the whole thing is being handled. 
Not much. They are pretty much identical, except for some minor syntactic sugar with signals and some python specific datatype smarts. 
What API are you wrapping? Maybe take a look at similar wrappers and see if there's patterns you'd like to emulate.

I saw this literally just after deciding to wrap up working on a project that involves SQLite in python for the day. I wouldn't say it's irrelevant to python devs at all. &amp;#x200B; SQLite is fantastic for storing certain kinds of data, provided you never use it's ability to update just one record at a time easily and reliably as an excuse to spam the disk with trash. Seems like a lot of apps have gotten better about that, but for a while everyone thought it was fun to save every single window position the moment you moved it and things like that.
Yeah everything bar the matplotlib chat. That‚Äôs underestimated.

Well, it's *emotionally* true. The trick is to chain the hierarchies. plt.gca().get_yaxis().get_major_formatter().set_scientific(False) is one line, but the way you would see it in most textbooks, it would be three. 
Pretty sure that Porsche isn‚Äôt self-driving either. 
That's weird, why would fluent interfaces by non-pythonic? Pandas is totally built around the idea.
I mean, that's to build a general charting program that works across many platforms and rendering engines. You could produce a single plot with much less code if you didn't care about any flexibility.

Mars Curiosity is correct. It was written in C and it has 2.5 million lines. However, the log files were tested in Python. I don't know the rest.
I think it includes software that wasn't on the AGC in the spacecraft. The computer that flew was indeed very small. Comparing to a modern machine is hard, but combined RAM and ROM was less than 40 kilowords of memory, with 15 bit words.

I don‚Äôt care what is modern. I‚Äôm going to keep using pip and Anaconda. Those things keep changing. I wrote my setup.py for my open source project 8 years ago based on a work setup.py from years before that. Still uses setuptools and supports python 2/3. Works fine.
Well, that's because it is powerful and provides lots of flexibility. One can of course use libraries like Seaborn, ggplot or bokeh (on browser) which are more high level and involves far less code.
I'm just saying, people have to try ROOT plotting before complaining about matplotlib.
Some people think that "one call per line, with temporary variables" is easier to debug. Less manipulation required if you find that you want to inspect the state partway through the sequence. "One call per line" is also favored if you've adopted the 80-column line width requirement from PEP 8.
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing. 2 minor updates in 13 years.
How many sensors do you really have? What‚Äôs your underlying geometry representation?
This is not a pip problem. Better find something else. The project is very old and not supported. [https://github.com/zvodd/sendkeys-py-si/issues/1](https://github.com/zvodd/sendkeys-py-si/issues/1) &amp;#x200B;
I appreciate the idea and it's done well, but like you said this is cheating and should NOT be used in game. 
Well yes and no. You could create a minimal plot that uses less code. However if you want all the bells and whistles this is the worst case. 
&gt; flat is better than nested Some people feel that method chains which are too long are overly nested. There's validity to both sides. Sometimes it makes sense to break stuff up into chunks, naming things along the way. But as long as the API is named well, the intermediate names shouldn't be as needed.
If you want to be a front end guy you should head straight to HTML, CSS, JavaScript with quick jump to react . But that is not the same thing as data science. So I am a little confused about what is your exact goal here. I am not in a position to give career advice on which is more in need, but to my outside observer view it seems like data science is more in demand than front end, or at least there is not as many people taking it as there is JavaScript developers

While I have heard altair is pretty good, I think we shouldn't abandon matplotlib for it. matplotlib is very feature rich and people have been working on it for years to improve it and add more options. I think it would be a better idea to use matplotlib and build a cleaner API on top of it. The benefit for this is, that you can create your graphs with the added package, but if you need to do something fancier, you can still use the more advanced underlying matplotlib functions. This is for example something that plotnine uses. Just like altair plotnine's approach is a layered visualization grammer. Plotnine is inspired by the famous ggplot2 library of R. Which could help people transitioning from R to Python (which happens more and more now that Python is becoming increasingly popular.) I have little experience with plotnine, but at least I can tell it is less mature than altair. I hope it will however so that I can use it more in the future. I currently use seaborn. Seaborn works really well with pandas dataframes and uses the same design approach by providing a higher level interface for matplotlib. I can say that I often use the underlying matplotlib functions to manipulate an existing seaborn plot whenever I need to do something specialized. Just some thoughts I wanted to share about matplotlib alternatives. 
I know, right? `exec` is cheating. Let's *actually* make it one line - one expression even. (lambda scope: [scope.__setitem__('requests', __import__('requests')), (lambda: [scope.__setitem__('__resp', scope['requests'].get('https://python.org')), scope.__setitem__('resp', scope['__resp'].__enter__()), print(scope['resp'].text), scope['__resp'].__exit__(None, None, None), None][-1])() if __name__ == '__main__' else None][-1])(globals())
That's the stuff

Glad to know I'm not alone. Haha There have been times where my manager made the same call and after weeks of modifications, my team realized it would have been faster to re-write. There can be so many "gotchas" hidden in code like you described. 
Reason why you might want to use this, straight from the readme: Pyright was created to address gaps in existing Python type checkers like mypy. &gt; # Speed &gt; &gt; Pyright is typically 5x or more faster than mypy and other type checkers that are written in Python. It is meant for large Python source bases. It can run in a ‚Äúwatch‚Äù mode and performs fast incremental updates when files are modified. &gt; # No Dependency on Python Environment &gt; &gt; Pyright is written in TypeScript and runs within node. It does not require a Python environment or imported third-party packages to be installed. This is especially useful when used with the VS Code editor, which uses node as its extension runtime. &gt; # Configurability &gt; &gt; Pyright supports flexible configuration that provides granular control over settings. Different ‚Äúexecution environments‚Äù can be specified for different subsets of a source base. Each environment can specify different PYTHON_PATH settings, python language version, and platform target. Personally, I think the fact that it requires the node runtime is downside, because there's two scenarios: you either have node or you don't. With a python based type checker, you are almost guaranteed to have python installed.

If you run the build method then yes the table will build on a page that has space. The problem shows up if your tables to big to fit on a page. I have not found a easy method of breaking a table up onto multiple pages if the table is to big to fit on one page. I'm right now trying to figure out a function that will break up each row of a table if the paragraphs in the table cells is to big to fit on a page. The best I come up with is tracking the space on a page and building each row separately and if a row is to big on a page trying to break these up into smaller chunks that would fit on a page.

Hi I‚Äôm one of those people! If you have an SLA to keep a service up of under 1 hour at p99.9, that gives six hours of downtime a year. I worked on one of those, and it was continual deployment with 90% line and 75% branch coverage. This led to on average 1 page (15 minute response time) a week. Say what you will about being able to hook a debugger up to a prod service (we had elaborate security in place, but I get it), that SLA would have been utterly impossible to keep without being able to do it. And without a very important CR rule, we wouldn‚Äôt have been able to keep it: No call chaining. Not because it‚Äôs a bad idea, or looks bad. For an entirely pragmatic reason: our tooling couldn‚Äôt show us the intermediates. We worked in Java, so sometimes it was literally optimized out. We had to support a service we took on that didn‚Äôt have that rule. We broke it out in two weeks because we knew it was important, scheduled it before we took it over, but we missed every SLA page for those two weeks. After? Not a single one until it was retired almost a year later. There were lots of pieces to this puzzle, the most important were wire logs (used to replay against local-&gt;ephemeral sandbox-&gt;staging-&gt;prod in that order until it can be reproduced), idempotent APIs, immutable data, request IDs being forwarded to dependencies, and degraded mode (apply updates when it‚Äôs back up, show most of the page ‚Äúprices in your area unavailable‚Äù) for when they‚Äôre down. Anyway. Current tooling (and there‚Äôs no excuse, it just sucks) does not expose call chain intermediate values, and until it does this is one piece of writing code that can be supported at that level. And it costs practically nothing from the developer, compiler, or running process. Developer doesn‚Äôt feel their freedom, compiler has to probably do more work, I dunno, and running process has to actually instantiate the intermediate objects (in compiled/JIT languages, Python and Ruby and others there‚Äôs literally no difference). And once you get used to it, it makes it a lot easier to follow a ton of guidelines‚Äîlaw of demeter, single responsibility, and short (not lines of code, what it does) methods. Oh and avoiding nested control structures. So, you call-chaining son or daughter of a female dog, what does call chaining do that outweighs that?
They make it sound like a plus that it doesn't depend on python, but on node. \*facepalm\* Really convenient that I do not need to have a python runtime install to check the types _for my python program_. But you need to install node cuz ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø.
It depends on node ffs Microsoft 
Python will load the JSON as it's defined, which will be a list or a dictionary, so you can jsut treat it as that.

A little program to stitch pdf's 4 or 2 pages into 1, with the option to specify intervals, and adding white pages to avoid overlapping when printing. I use it to print university presentations so I don't have to copy in class. The problem was, those presentations are usually made from PPT presentations, and most of the times 1 slide took more than 5 pages in the pdf because they are completed by bits in the presentation. So I spent all day making the program detect when that happens, and it works perfectly!

Well I think it is a legitimate critique of the subreddit. The majority of the posts to this subreddit seem to be self promotion of tutorials showing how to do something quite trivial because it simply involves importing a module that does the interesting stuff for you. Some of these types of posts are fine but it tends to drown out anything actually interesting. It‚Äôs not so simple to just scroll past the content when it is such a large majority of the posts.

If you refuse to post your code, try to describe what you're attempting to do and provide a similar example of what's tripping you, and post your errors that you're encountering. If you do want to learn, it's a great place to get help. You just have to meet them halfway. If you just want someone else to do your homework for you, neither here nor there is the place for you. 
just sent one thank you &amp;#x200B;
I think you need to provide an example of what you want. That sounds a bit coarse.
I dont need anyone to do it for me I just have a small issue that i tried to solve and don't understand
I think by no Python dependency they meant you are not forced to have, say, python 3.6.7 installed for Pyright meanwhile the project you‚Äôre working on is 3.3.0 only. Having an external dependency is a definite plus in case you hate messing around with multiple python dependencies + they simplified its integration to VSC. But that‚Äôs my two cents
This is great, thanks. Are there any plans to implement pre/post script hooks? It'd be great to fire a snapshot task for my persistent data after shutting down the existing container and before bringing the new one up.
Good to hear, r/learnpython will be perfect then. Describe what is causing you problems, as if you were describing it to a rubber duck. Tell them the error you're getting and what input is causing it. There's also a wealth of learning resources cataloged on their sidebar (same for this sub actually)

Yes, your explanation sounds reasonable.
Both I'd say, at least until I did this project and learned more about proper project structure, testing, documentation and all that good stuff. I guess I can call myself a hobbyist and aspiring professional at this point.

It was cross posted because I wasn‚Äôt sure where the issue was and was not making any progress after a substantial amount of time researching the issue. Please forgive me for not knowing something before I asked the question.
Some Python packages, like psycopg2, require additional system libraries. Simply installing Python requirements is not enough in those situations.

Gotcha. Didn't look at the timestamps on the replies.
Requires node. For a python type checker. No. Just no. 
Not one entity controls any of what you are talking about. We are a community building tools for one another. You use what you can from the community, otherwise you build it yourself. 
I agree with the node runtime argument, but I already use VS Code so there's no downside for me. If I was using another text editor though, I'd stick with mypy.
Everybody complaining it depends on node (which, by the way, is a lot easier to install different versions of than python), and nobody looking at how it's faster and has better integration with vscode. I for one think this is cool and wanna try it out.
OK no problem
I suspect they're not really expecting to gain much traction among those not already using VSCode...
I think the "no dependency" on python, while unusual, could be a plus. As they've noted, installing it on vscode is a bonus. As a experienced Python programmer I can navigate Python dependencies on my machine, but this allows me to tell one of my colleagues "hey install VSCode and Pyright" and your code will be better for it. That said, what does this do better than MyPy except for speed? I use Vim and even on large projects (~10,000 lines of Python) it doesn't take very long for MyPy lints to show up in the Vim gutter. If it has better static analysis capabilities than MyPy that would be neat. I've noticed sometimes MyPy will think a type is right when it shouldn't (I haven't identified the exact issue, but I think it has to do with inheritance). I wonder if they have encountered a similar issue and then decided it's worth it to rewrite ALL the static type checking in TypeScript. I wish they chose something other than TypeScript though. Go, Rust or even Nim would have been great! I don't have node installed on my machine and to set this up with Vim I don't want to have to install the Node runtime.

Thanks for bringing this point up. I admit, I get a bit too nit picky ... especially with computers.
 import boto3 def handler(event, context) -&gt; None: """Lambda handler.""" ec2 = boto3.resource("ec2") all_ec2_instances = ec2.instances.all() for ec2_instance in all_ec2_instances: ec2_instance.create_tags(Tags=[{"Key": "YourTag", "Value": "YourValue"}]) Also, /r/learnpython.
Pardon, but that's not quite it. I would change it to &gt;#**`¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø`**
I would say that's somewhat debatable, although I do like it most of the time! Like I said, we did things the way we did because of the sheer number of services we interact with and don't have time to invest in the meta programming for the syntax sugar at the moment, but it was still a massive improvement and moved toward the Pythonic end of things. Iterative improvements :)
Can this be condensed 
Python is pretty much the leading language rn for data science, so you've got that right. Although if you're look to be a front end engineer (the stuff the users interact with like GUI and other surface level software) you really should be learning JS/HTML/CSS and as soon as you have a grasp on that, learn nodejs and react. For datascience though, you're gonna see a lot of python and maybe some java/c++. Most popular ml libraries have interfaces written in those three. 
Your requirement specified that it had to check if the tag exists already. That‚Äôs as concise as it gets while remaining pythonic.
VScode is a pretty decent editor for many things. I am using it almost daily. I used Intellij earlier 
I mean... well done? But the concept here is definitely opposite to the Python paradigm. Also the fact that's it's being published on GitHub by windows suggests to me that it's a dead-end codebase. If Windows is giving it away it's probably got hella mold. It seems like it's just a niche linter. It may be 5x faster than the IDE, but that's because... it's doing 50x less than the IDE. Also, how can you justify a dedicated type checking utility? You probably can't anything more than the existing linter's analysis, and you're not going to find an algorithm that beats a directed graph. 
You might want to do: for a, b in zip(lst, lst[1:]): if a &gt; b: #...
Teaching myself Django and make image classifying app for photographers. Question: when it comes to making image classifier with keras/tensorflow, people put images into two separate categories. How do you built the deep learning system with more than two categories for images?
...did you even look into it? Python has had static typing with PEP 484 for quite a while now via mypy. This is an alternative, faster implementation by Microsoft written for better integration with VS Code. 
I'm a huge fan of PEP484. But this isn't a meaningfully faster implementation, it's the same thing the linter does but dedicated and with a different output. &amp;#x200B; &gt;The Python VS Code plugin is the official Python support extension for VS Code. It is officially supported by a team of engineers at Microsoft. It supports a diverse array of features including debugging, linter plugins, type checking plugins, and much more. Pyright is focused entirely on type checking. It is a side project with no dedicated team. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Needs extra work as using a list like this will fail. ```python In [1]: next([1,2]) -------------------------------------------------------- TypeError Traceback (most recent call last) &lt;ipython-input-1-b9d20096048c&gt; in &lt;module&gt; ----&gt; 1 next([1,2]) TypeError: 'list' object is not an iterator ``` 
So how does one install this as a command line tool? I'm a Python dev who does not know node.js - the build instructions are not clear on CLI installation.
Poor coding habbit. Better use islice and not hit a bug in production when the data sets are extremely large.
A non-cynical answer is https://packaging.python.org/overview/ That *should* serve as an overview of what tools their are, where we're largely headed, and what tools go with which use cases. If you find that documentation lacking, please file a bug and I'll be happy to see what I can do to make it more helpful!
Advantages of VSCode over IntelliJ in your opinion?
Here's the best mummification I could do: ``` import boto3 def get_resource_tags(resource): """Return a resource's tags.""" tags = None if isinstance(resource, dict) and resource.get("Tags", None) is not None: tags = resource["Tags"] else: try: tags = resource.tags except (AttributeError, TypeError): pass return tags def tag_exists(resource, key: str) -&gt; bool: """Return True if tag exists, regardless of value.""" tags = get_resource_tags(resource) if tags: return any(x.values() for x in tags if key in x.values()) return False def handler(event, context) -&gt; None: """Lambda handler.""" ec2 = boto3.resource("ec2") for ec2_instance in ec2.instances.all(): if not tag_exists(ec2_instance, "YourTag"): ec2_instance.create_tags(Tags=[{"Key": "YourTag", "Value": "YourValue"}]) ```
I think you misread the README a bit. This is aiming at becoming a full PEP 484-compliant type checker. That question was saying that, unlike the official Python plugin, this *only* handles the type checking. The project focus is definitely on the LSP side, but that doesn't mean it's just a linter. 
&lt;joke&gt;On Github Python and TypeScript have similar colors: https://i.imgur.com/hYyFbdt.png , which indicates clearly that the two languages are very close to each other. Although it's written in TypeScript, "it's almost Python"&lt;/joke&gt;

In addition to VSCode, JupyterLab also uses node to manage extensions. Using JupyterLab with pip was the first time I had to install node. It's also worth noting that I've installed JupyterLab with conda and vscode with chocolatey and never knew node was part of it because it was handled by the package managers. There's a chance I could use pyright and never know or care that it's in TypeScript if it was just part of the VSCode experience. I don't know or care what my PyCharm plugins are written in. Java?
You how some people say there are no stupid questions? That's not true at all.
So I love inbox, but don't know really anything about what this repo is. Can you link me some resources to get started?

Why do you have requirements/base.txt instead of just requirements.txt? Also I think the project structure should be changed so that all Django-related files/directories are in one directory called 'missinboxalready', and things like your Dockerfile and nginx config should be outside of that directory.

I shied away from plotly early on because I was first exposed to it years ago as a website where you upload your data to analyze and plot it. I think offline didn't come until later so I'm not sure I understand. If I use plotly or plotly express, is my proprietary data safe and kept local? I can use it the same way I use bokeh, matplotlib, etc?
&gt; No Dependency on Python Environment Yeah &gt; Pyright is written in TypeScript and runs within node Uhh!!!!! 
It‚Äôs becoming clear that mypy is not catching up fast enough. Both fb and Microsoft has developer a stand-alone typechecker. Not sure if it‚Äôs well known in the python community, but TypeScript has THE best gradual type system ever made, sets ups great example in the dynamic programming world. 
It's just an unnecessary dependency. It's a lot more likely to have Python installed, especially if you are working on a Python project.
Well type hinting is only for Python 3.4+ and I don't think it's hard to write Python code that works on Python 3.4 and all the newer versions.

Yeah, luckily enough ppl have had the issue I found that solution relatively quickly.
Is there idea that you wouldn't need to ship the docker container, just the same as per for one and it gets generated on the fly? How long does that take? I've run Jupyter notebooks on binder and it takes like a minute or so to spin up so I'm imagining something like that. So I guess the overhead of the container spin up and the temporary usage of 1GB HDD space is worth it to avoid dealing with dependencies? Is this the philosophical opposite of microservices? 
too lazy to bother
&gt; I am working as a python developer. yeah right
that was a joke?
Have you ever considered that dependency injection might ba a code smell?
Those are actually pretty solid points. Didn't think of them.
Build server is more likely to have python then node, unless the CI server is built in node. That said I suppose speed is always helpful
Which they now own.
No python 2.x support :(
It's a common way to have a base, dev and prod environment: base.txt &gt;Django==1.0 &gt; dev.txt &gt; - r base.txt &gt; pytest prod.txt &gt; -r base.txt &gt; unicorn 
thank you
This is because vscode already has a node runtime
It's not a problem on a development machine, but it would make my docker image for CI more complicated and twice as big. So it's a problem.
You have time to think because it's slow? :)
I'd argue that type checking should be (also) done in CI.
Can you eli5 what exactly markdown is?
Lol but py2 is EOL at the end of the year
Well there are still legacy systems written in python 2.x but I get the point
Ho, no it is not easier to install npm that python. It is exactly the same. Nvm is the equivalent of pyenv.
You are talking about a specific use case, conda and jupyter are perfectly fitted for data science. But for real production level code, you don‚Äôt use that. I like them both but their target audience is not for python package developer, even if with lot of knowledge you can use them. Most of jupyter users does not care about python programming, they want their graph or regression. In that case, a python checker written in node is not a problem. For any normal python programmer, is it completely ridiculous to have to install node to type check my code.
Yes, sorry but need to move on. Python 3 is not that hard and much better
Well, is it really better than mypy? Speed might be a good advantage in IDE, but does it handle case mypy does not ?
Pyright's fools gold? Was that meant? &amp;#x200B;
What vscode? It's fast as hell in my experience
go away with that code lmao
I hadn't known about the [Protocols: Structural subtyping](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0544/) PEP. 
In my opinion it is wrong advertisement. They are focusing that it do not require python and then they are pointing out that it depends on node, what is really not a problem when you are developing application in Python (you need to have at least one interpreter for your project. They should focus mostly on great integration with VSCode
**next((false for i, v in enumerate(lst) if v &lt; len(lst)-1 and v&gt;lst\[i+1\]))**
Right you can just not use it and now you don't have the dependency. But if you don't mind the dependency great you're good to use this. Options are wonderful to have so I think it's great.
Inheritance and duck typing are inherently tricky because an class that inherits isn't guaranteed to have it's parent's traits, but it most likely does. Python doesn't have _implements_ so ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

That‚Äôs pretty awesome!
This looks very similar to Logo.
Thanks!
What is Logo?
Logo was/is a scripting language that allowed you to do basically the that turtle does. Turtle was very likely inspired by Logo.
Try using this: ts = turtle.getscreen() ts,getcanvas().postscript(‚ÄòFilename.eps‚Äô) This saves the turtle project much better than screen capture. Have fun!
A steganography program! Using the pillow/PIL modules to return and save pixel data, with all modifications done by manually encoding text to binary and spreading it over the pixels in a nonlinear order. Currently working on content type other than plaintext. I hate it and don't know why I chose this project. 
Real eye tracking is telling what the eyes look at. This just tell their orientation inside the eye socket. 
I didn't ask about your life story, keep that to your psychologist. All I'm saying is that it has nothing to do with Python. You don't post regex cheatsheets just because you can use it in Python, do you? Fucking retard.
u/nxg hit the nail on the head. [Here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)) is the wiki for it. I imagine a lot of folks' first introduction to programming in school would've been Logo, as it was for me.

I tried it, I saw it made a vector graphic out of it. I will use it next time!
Ah yes, I remember installing Python 3, and messing around with turtle in the beginning. Good times.
OK, thanks for the info
What do you mean "turn arrays into images"? Matplotlib's "imshow"function says it can take PIL input: https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.imshow.html
I have no idea how to use it. Not a web guy. Why not just make it run in python?
There's no point in pinning Postgres, you don't want to ignore a security fix on your production deploy. This said, there's `apt-mark hold package`
No. Type hinting is simply the definition of a syntax. Mypy supports all versions of python with annotations, so python 3.0+ and python 2.7 with different syntax. There is a typing module added in 3.4, but was backported.
Huh, all hail the hypnoturtle? :-)
Do you feel better about yourself? I am seeking advice and help. You seem ignorant and uneducated so I‚Äôll leave it at that. 
I decided to try and improve turning maths into code so I made a script that finds the smallest possible number with x factors.

PIL isn‚Äôt pillow. Use pillow. PIL is a python 2 only module and is dead. Pillow duplicates the API and supports python 2/3.
I am sure that if you really wanted to, you could learn how to install node. It's simpler than dealign with python packaging. However, whether or not you want to, or should have to, are questions worth asking.
Did you see the tag?
I put software engineer/data scientist because I am interested in learning both. I know they are different positions. I want to build applications but I also want to learn how to extract valuable information from data. I‚Äôm sure this subreddit has people who are proficient in both. I should have clarified that in the initial post. 
What‚Äôs hard about python packaging? As far as I‚Äôm concerned, it‚Äôs solved. Go back 10 years and you‚Äôd be horrified at the state of packaging. Just use pip. I‚Äôm not trying to solve some complex dependency tree because packages lie about their dependencies anyways. I know my dependencies. Adding node as a dependency is like forcing a user to build your python-C code instead of you distributing a wheel. Just install C++ on Windows...not gonna happen.
Thanks for your input. I want to learn both. I want to build applications and extract information from data. I should have worded it differently in the initial post. I understand that a software engineer is different from data scientist. I assumed this subreddit had individuals who use other languages other than python which is why I asked. Some people are senior systems engineers who have worked with data scientists, front end web developers, research analysts, to achieve the organizations goals. So I figured I put both.
Using pip is itself not the same as pressing one button. You need to put the setup file in, maybe create console scripts, and then related to this is where and how you import resources (if they're supposed to be user editable, the should be in the users documents folder?), and how you get project shipped to a non-techical end user on windows. And then you need a wheel for each operating system, which needs that OS installed to reliably build. Maybe this is easy for you, or maybe you only need a subset of this functionality, but it's still more involved than installing node.
Ask your homework questions in /r/learnpython, in the form of the code you already have written, and outlining what you have difficulty grasping. 
What is turtle library based around?
We did Logo as kids as part of of our computers class. Trip down nostalgia lane for me. No wonder Turtle seemed familiar.
This is just a toy to show Google we love inbox :-(
It's what @Funnnny pointed out. Right now theres no real need since all requirements are the same for all environments. I agree with the `missinboxalready` dir.
I guess it is based around Tkinter, it uses the Tkinter canvas
Good question! Plotly.py (the `plotly` module) contains both: * "offline mode" code (`plotly.offline`) which keeps all data and plots local and behaves like Bokeh, matplotlib etc; and * "online mode" code (`plotly.plotly`) which acts as an API client for Plotly's Chart Studio Cloud product It's difficult to accidentally/unknowingly send your data to the cloud because to use online mode you have to sign up to Chart Studio Cloud, get an API token, configure it etc first so if you do none of that and use `plotly.offline` your data is all local. **Plotly Express (the `plotly_express` module) uses `plotly.offline` internally and so does not send your data anywhere.** PS: we're working on making this clearer in our code and documentation to avoid all future confusion about this!
Thanks for elaborating and indeed I think this sounds nice! 
Awwww... I miss Logo: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language) 
the tiny little line end turtle in the bottom left got me
It looks similar, because it is Logo implementation it Python. 
Came to say the same thing. It must be inspired by it ‚Äî both used a turtle. 
my bad, it is turtle graphics implementation, Logo itself Lisp's dialect. 
I am a begginer in python, i just wanted to know which programming language is used in this script apart form python. (I am just guessing by seeing ur code that more than one language is used)
Regex patterns never really stick for me, so I wrote some [classes](https://github.com/johnfraney/blog-examples/blob/master/human-readable-regular-expressions-python/regex_patterns.py) to try to make it easier to write certain types of regular expression sequences (groups, lookaheads, lookbehinds). I'm curious to hear about other strategies you might have to make regex patterns easier to maintain. ("Just learn the darn things" will probably be high on the list.)

Don't use them. In eleven out of ten cases, there's a better solution not involving regular expressions beyond the readability horizon.

Almost every front end web development tool (ie transpiler, bundler) which runs at build time is built on node. Every CI server supports node.

I've made a script that chooses and plays a random south park episode. Girlfriend was overwhelmed by my neediness but pleased with the result. Thing is that I spent 15ish minutes actually writing the script and I'd say more than half an hour dealing with the environment variables (pip installed on py 3.5 and the script was run by py 3.7). I've worked out how to deal with that, so I'm pretty satisfied. (needles to say, I'm a beginner) 
&gt; none of them work How did you test this? &gt; but that's not the case How do you know this?
Because I submitted it and it's says "Wrong!" lol

Oh ok

This saves the turtle.
But python is a language you know. I‚Äôm not asking you to package, I‚Äôm saying just use someone else‚Äôs package. Pip install a package. Done. Installers have their own challenges. Configuration is a pain, which is why I don‚Äôt build python-C packages from source. I just got the task to install Abaqus, a very popular and expensive FEA code onto Linux last Friday. Just run the StartGUI.sh script is what the install manual said. Oh turns out I have to install the korn shell...odd. Turns out I need AIX Linux and not Ubuntu; that‚Äôs a commercial Linux that we‚Äôre not going to pay for. Now I need to hack the installer to make it work for a program that costs $40k. Seems like the need a lesson in how to build an installer. I did my click.
That's optical illusion level 2.
 type(df.loc[0,'balances']) dict So each record is a dictionary. If you want a single element from the dictionary you could... df.loc[0,'balances']['projectedMinutes'] You could do this on the entire column... df['balances'].apply(lambda x: x['projectedMinutes'] It might be useful to extract the dictionary key value pairs to new columns: for i in df.loc[0,'balances'].keys(): df[i] = df['balances'].apply(lambda x: x[i]) Then you could see all the values with simple DataFrame indexing. df['projectedMinutes']

No, I think what /u/netgu means is front-end dev is just css/html/javascript and about as far removed from software engineering/data science as a 'developer' can be. Front end devs, and I'm trying to be polite here, are pretty far removed from what I'd even call software engineering. Much much more on the graphics design end of things. I've met professional front end devs that have literally zero knowledge of design patterns, big-o notation, etc. They're more "slice and dice in Photoshop and cobble together some CSS/HTML to get it displayed" than debug and profile hotspots, and certainly not data science.
&gt;more in demand than front end, or at least there is not as many people taking it as there is JavaScript developers &amp;#x200B; A little of both, I'd assume. Even if there's a lot more total front-end dev jobs, front-end dev is WAY less technical than data science, so there's going to be vastly more applicants, making it much easier to fill spots, and thus less "loud" when it comes to help-wanted presence.
[Dependency Injection Is Evil](https://www.tonymarston.net/php-mysql/dependency-injection-is-evil.html) &lt;--- the headline &amp;#x200B; the conclusion to the article is "I do not believe in the idea that it automatically provides benefits in *all* circumstances." which is a big fat fucking "duh" &amp;#x200B; but DI has it's uses, even if you dont see a use for it. 
Thanks for the clarification. I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm not familiar with everything. I‚Äôll read about the different positions more in depth.
No worries. A overly general simplification is this: Front end dev = A graphical designer who knows a bit of code. Software engineer = Anything, really, but code-oriented, cares about things like proper design patterns, big-o, etc. In context of front-end, think more of this being the person writing the front-end frameworks rather than using them. Data science = More mathematics with a side of code. Similar to front end dev in the sense that both have a primarily non-code focus and use software to enable their desired end goal, rather than software itself being the end goal.
There you go!
Alrighty then, I'll make a post in a few days. I have a midterm coming up and some job things I need to take care of. I'll be sure to tag you in the post! 
Thanks for this: I will make sure to do that. However, whenever I type pip install pillow, it says files of a certain type are not recognised. I will redirect to /r/learnpython.
It's turtles all the way down. 
If type(c) == 'int':
It's faster and uses less memory than IntelliJ in my experience.
What on earth have caused you to mount a crusade against me over such an obvious question?
Read our sidebar Visit r/learnpython Lookup `isinstance`
Fair enough point!
&gt;If type(c) == 'int' That's comparing a type with string.
The other answers addressed your question, but it looks like this isn't actually what you want anyway. From your code's `if: #c integer` it sounds like you don't want to check whether c is an integer datatype but rather whether c represents an integer. The difference is, c will *never* have an integer type, it will always be a float, but it might be a float that represents an integer value such as `2.0`.

Just speaking Python vs Java, Python is a dynamically typed language with many interfaces for interactive coding. The benefits of this are faster code development. Java takes longer to develop because you must catch every exception and correctly declare the type and scope of every variable in advance of the program compiling. This front loading of development resources in Java does that mean that if a Java program runs at app then it probably runs correctly. So if you have little tolerance for error then you may want to go with Java. However planning for every eventuality that might happen in your code can he criticized as premature optimization, and if you agree then that's a pretty persuasive case to use Python instead. So to summarize, Python leads to rapid speed of development, while Java leads to stability of deployment. You must choose what is best for you. Traditionally though webapps are a competitive market space in terms of features whereas people are already used to wonky errors and downtime, which is probably why Python and other dynamic interactive languages like Ruby and Nodejs are favored for web app development. I think Spring's reason-to-be is that most CS students are experienced in Java so it allows them to develop a web app in a language they are comfortable with but there is no compelling language-property of Java that makes this particularly desirable that I know of.

Lots of concerns about the Node requirement, which I share. I have been worrying for a while that Java/Typescript has clearly beaten Python as a UI scripting language (evidence: VSCode and Jupyter). Now we‚Äôre building Python type checkers in Typescript. At what point do people go the whole hog and remove Python from their stack in favour of Java/Typescript?
When doing comparisons use "==". Using one "=" just sets the variable. 
Omg thank you so much 
From python3.5 or 3.6 there are type annotations in python (no impac on runtime, just ide and external checker) and it seems that's "programming the way guido intended it"- few colons, letters, some arrow and optional but still. java8 is second (or third? i'm too young to tell) life for java. lambda and streams are so dynamic in use that it almost don't fell like java. They eliminate large amount of boilerplate (no more anonymous classes) and introduce Optional (Either is in 3rd party library i think) so time-to-market is shorter and null is almost non-existent. Data classes and sealed types (default getter, setter, toString, hash etc) are currently evaluating in java and probably will drop around 2022 (even less boilerplate). Only pitfalls of java are these terrible mistakes from begging (function/method parameters aren't final, default values for object fields etc) and old projects on spring3/jpa/servlets/jsf. Python is moving as fast or faster (python3.7 has already dataclass module (default getter/setter etc)), but with worst performance and no enterprise usage in web (still 90% of job maket) or enterprise framework (hate that term).

It depends on the size of your codebase. As my typescript codebase is getting bigger, I can feel vscode getting slower to the point where I'm starting to have more time to think.
[This project](https://github.com/rwev/derivat) uses PyQt with OpenGL to render 3D surfaces of financial prices. It isn't completely what you're wanting to do, but uses some techniques that could be useful in your case. Expensive price calculations are done by a Cython thread and piped real-time into the table / graphs as they are finished. The source of the values is different in your case (coming from the sensors) but getting them into tables / graphs real time overlaps. Good luck. 
Eh, [what the hell](https://github.com/ithaka/apiron/issues/33).
If you've got a big legacy codebase, Python 3 migration is a big project. And Python 2 to 3 migration is, to my mind, the most important use case for static typing in Python. 
&gt;Python is moving as fast or faster (python3.7 has already dataclass module (default getter/setter etc)), but with worst performance and no enterprise usage in web (still 90% of job maket) Quite a few sites run on Python Web frameworks, including Instagram, Youtube, Reddit, Dropbox, Disqus, Pinterest, and of course others.
Yes but the more you delay the migration the harder I will get. We did the migration of twisted based code, lot of lot of code. Took a few try. First convert to python2+3 compatible code. Worth the migration. Hard to justify to management, but hopefully the end of life date will give a big argument to justify this cost
Amazing, I am starting to mess it also. Would love to see the code if you are willing to share it üôÇ
Thank you.

I'm not familiar with 2.7 if that's what your using. If your on python 3 then the () are unnecessary in user name and the : after user and password shouldn't be there.
Nevermind I'm wrong about the colons.
yeh just realised that
How? I find them really useful for parsing text
There are also scikit-image and OpenCV. Both are easy to install and work with numpy arrays.
As I wrote, as soon as you get beyond whats immediate readable, you've taken regular expressions too far. For instance, splitting words on boundaries are fine, but stemming them using regular expressions aren't. 
Password should be a string.
It looks like you're unaware of [re.VERBOSE](https://docs.python.org/library/re.html#re.VERBOSE). 
This is correct
Been using this all morning (via VSCode extension) and it's **awesome**. It's extremely fast and has already saved me about an hour of debugging. I highly recommend testing it out if you use VSCode -- I have not tested the CLI yet.

I sure was. Thanks for sharing that. Looks like this allows writing a regex pattern across multiple lines so you can write a comment about each part. Here's the example from the [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.VERBOSE): a = re.compile(r"""\d + # the integral part \. # the decimal point \d * # some fractional digits""", re.X) I'll read more into this and update my post when I get the opportunity.

Have you heard about this great tool to search stuff online: [https://www.google.com/](https://www.google.com/) ? :) &amp;#x200B; I'd recommend downloading a Python distribution like Anaconda or Active Python, which come with all the packages most commonly used for data science. Anaconda is possibly the most widely used. &amp;#x200B; You will need at least pandas, as you correctly identified, to import and store the data, and matplotlib (or also seaborn, which extends matplotlib's functionalities) to make the plots. Importing large Excel files is slow - if you can save the data to CSV it will be much much faster

Before answering the question from a technical standpoint, I think understanding your career ambitions is more important: do you want to be an investment analyst who can code a bit, or do you want to be a coder / data scientist / quant etc in finance? Many people say, and I would tend to agree, that **if you work in a datascience/coding role in a place like Facebook, Google, Microsoft etc then you are in a very crucial and core role. If you do that in a bank or any other kind of industry, yours will be a support role**: other people in other roles will make the key decisions, have better career paths, get paid more, be recognised more internally, etc. Nothing wrong with that, but it's important to be clear on what you can reasonably expect. &amp;#x200B; "The quantitative side of asset management" is such a broad term that it's impossible to give you an answer. Pricing derivatives is (almost) all about stochastic calculus, so a good knowledge in the field is key. But, again, what do you want to do? If you are an Economics major you stand zero chance of working on the more technical and mathematically intense aspects of the internal libraries used by a financial institution to price derivatives etc - those tend to be roles for PhDs in mats, statistics, physics etc. No economics graduate can compete with those guys. If instead you want to be, I don't know, a trader of derivatives and you wouldn't mind some familiarity with Python for finance, that's a completely different story. &amp;#x200B; Other areas of finance may use generalised linear models, decision trees, random forests and other classification algorithms to cluster and classify - eg identifying payers vs non-payers. &amp;#x200B; In general, I think any graduate working in finance or business should have a minimum of familiarity with basic database concepts (**do learn the basics of SQL**) and with a scripting language like Python. IMHO SQL is crucial because it makes you used to think about your data and its structure in a way that's alien to most Excel monkeys: how is my data strictured? What are the primary and foreign keys? What are the relationships among tables? Etc. I have seen soooo many colossal \*\*\*\*-ups because no one bothered thinking of these points you wouldn't believe it! &amp;#x200B; The datacamp machine learning course for finance seems interesting, but I think you first need to become familiar with pandas. There are plenty of resources online you can use to have a go at importing datas, exploring it, etc.
Check out /r/learnpython
Ah, damn. Thank you so much.
Open powershell. Enter `pip install pandas`.
Drools...
Hey thanks for the response. I see what you mean, I'll be more specific, I would like to be more of an investment analyst but with a solid proficiency in code because I am worried that it could affect my future employability if I don't. I have a basic SQL knowledge currently and python is my next target for sure. Someone suggested VBA? What is your opinion on it?
 x\[-1\] = np.nan , the value x\[1\] is null, so when it is doing operations it can sum or multiply giving u null
VBA sucks. Friends don't let friends use VBA! :) I find it is an outdated language, often used to 'patch' Excel and get it to do stuff it was never meant to do in the first place - eg if your data is too large, don't use VBA : use a tool other than Excel, or Excel with Powerquery Powerpivot etc. By all means, feel free to spend some time learning the basics to do stuff like automating the creation of a few charts etc, but I wouldn't spend too much time on it, and I would certainly not use it to solve problems which should be solved with a database or with a real language like Python. &amp;#x200B; You will be surprised how many commercial organisations rely on poorly written pieces of VBA. I have seen many situations of one guy who was hailed as the in-house Excel guru, learnt some VBA, put together some script that became increasingly important in the organisation, till a huge f\*up one day because one column was moved from C to D or because of some other stupid error like that (no, I'm not joking).

Yes, we're working on making the figure rendering framework much more flexible. See [https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1474](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1474) if you're interested. It's a pretty large refactor, so we're not certain yet when it will land, but Colab support is one of the motivations for this! &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Not really any reason to choose any high level language over another in my opinion. They all do the same thing at similar performance. It's just preference and what you have most experience in.
I know what it means. x86 is an architecture, it doesn't have system files. It's a bit like buidling a visual of cars seats in a door frame -- doesn't make a whole heap of sense. That's until I realised he meant the Windows directory labelled x86.

Currently I am just trying to refresh my current knowledge of Python. Sadly, I go to one of those colleges that as soon as you figure out one language they send you off to a new unrelated languages so eventually you tend to forget the first language you learned unless you make time to constant practice, which I can‚Äôt because I work 10 hours a day. So basically I am relearning the mid level stuff so I can get to the more advanced things. I want to build a website using Python and use it as a way to show off, like a resume of sorts.

People usually start with "Hello World" and r/learnpython.
PyPy, an alternative to CPython. Not to be confused with the more commonly known PyPi (the place you pip install from). I wish these projects would pick more distinctive names.

i did do research and followed the instructions to the T. What the instructions failed to mention is that you need to check the box that says making python part of the "PATH". I didn't check that in my initial download because I didn't know what the hell it was. 
I can't use the cx_oracle library so I am building a library that wraps around Oracle client's sqlplus executable. Calling it pyorasqlplus
First go through a small amount of excruciatingly boring days of going through the very basics, such as defining variables, basic string manipulation, getting to know a little bit about data structures like lists and dicts and also how to define functions and how they tend to be used in general. Any imaginable python beginner tutorial/course will start with this. The average person gets stuck here thinking he needs to master these basics and spends weeks/months on it, getting frustrated with the fact that there is no context or the real life applications aren't obvious, yet they don't feel like they can move on before it all makes sense. Don't do that, just learn that those things exist and a few basic exercises to get some hands on experience with them. They are building blocks of all applications and they won't make much sense to you until you use them in a program and combine them into more sophisticated structures, so let go of the feeling of uncertainty you will likely have at this stage, and take the leap to the next stage. The next stage. The part that will actually teach you how to code. Projects. Don't get stuck in analysis paralysis here, thinking you're not good enough yet or whatever. Pick a simple project to start with and get at it. Google your way out of trouble and keep going. This is how you learn.

thanks in the reply and the patience with my post! I was wondering why I received a down vote and I should have posted in the learnpython group. The ldap3 package I hear is newer than ldap, so the example I am trying to use is to learn and understand an example app that doesn't use TLS, when they should be, and so I'm trying to learn how to implement it with ldap3 rather than ldap. I will post in the learnpython group and the github. Thanks again
I think you're right. Must put {5} in parentesis, in each group of classes and not as a common factor of the pipe operator.

Hi! Very excited about this; I've been very frustrated as a geochemist trying to do data analysis on large datasets. We're always putting things, finding weird samples, wondering which one it is and if the signal is real... Anyway, I'm a bit of a noob to Python and never used Plotly but got it px going well enough just following the Medium post! That said, a few questions: - are there plans to beef up the documentation? I see I can make subplots by faceting (grouping in values in a column) but how do I make multiple subplots with the same datasets in each graph, just different axes? Like subp1 is magnesium contents vs potassium contents, and subp2 is gold abundance version silver concentration? Because I'd love to then get to use lasso/brushing to see how the selected samples plot in both spaces. - any way to make the data table interactive as well? Like I'd love to plot everything, highlight some outliers with brushing, and then somehow get to those rows in my df. Then I could set something like a column headed "Symbol" to a special value (e.g., "x" vs "o") so that those outlier points are clear in all later plots. Kinda like how brushing in JMP let's you right click and set display options like color and marker, or set values in a column. - how to make it so I can plot values that aren't already columns/do operations on columns before plotting? like maybe I want `y= "Elevation / 100` but I only have Elevation as a column? Guess I'm trying to imitate a commercial software called Aabel that is probably the best I've seen but it's annoying/not free/Mac only. And maybe that's not the plan for Plotly/would need a whole 'nother library? But I'm just grateful that people are making good interactive EDA tools, so thank you! And apologies if some of my questions are just the result of my inexperience with Plotly.
the one i did worked for me
And herein lies the dangers of a _mutable_ default value. A default argument for a given parameter is evaluated only once, when the function / method is first encountered by the interpreter (ie when the class is compiled to bytecode, _not_ when the method is first invoked). Because of this a mutable default acts very much like a class variable, and _all_ future calls to that method which end up using the defiant will use the same **set** instance. You can verify this by inspecting the **id** of the **visited** parameter in each invocation. And that is why there‚Äôs a different behavior. The explicit assignment _replaces_ the parameter name with a new **set** in the local namespace, leaving the default unmodified for future method invocations. From `visited = visited | {self}` onwards **visited** has a new id value and isn‚Äôt the same object in memory. The augmented assignment _mutates_ the default argument for the parameter; from `visited |= {self}` onwards **visited** (the default for any future invocations) has been expanded to contain **self**. The idiom is to use `visited=None` in the signature and then do something like `visited = visited or set()` in the body... that way mutating **visited** doesn‚Äôt matter as the default will always result in a fresh empty set. You should generally avoid mutable defaults _except_ for some rare cases of memorization where this behavior is actually what you want to exploit.

Your first paragraph lists concerns for people who produce packages. Your second paragraph implies that you were showing concerns for people who install packages. End users do not have to write "setup files" or "console scripts" or other things in order to type `pip install package-name`. All they have to do is type `pip install package-name`. Much as they would type `npm install package-name`.
Go to the folder you've download it, type `python khinsider.py jumping-flash' and it should be running. Beforehand you'll need these libs or I can see that the scirpt is trying to install them so you might run it as administrator/sudo. Install them via pip pip install "requests &gt;=2.0.0,&lt;3.0.0" "beautifulsoup4 &gt;= 4.4.0, &lt; 5.0.0'" After that it should be straightforward with the provided README in the project.

Hello As you told you once studied Java during your schooling which means you have atleast the basic knowledge of programming . Python is a easy language which is very much user friendly . With the basis concept of programming which you have it will be easy to learn . Some basic knowledge of Mathematics , Statistics , Probability are required which can be gain within a week of revision. When you have all these concept You can Pursue the course for Python from any Online Courses like Edureka which provides good Education. But it is always recommend to Take [Classroom Courses for Python](http://pythonandmltrainingcourses.com/courses/best-diploma-in-python-course-in-delhi/) because there are many advantages as compared to online courses.

Nice tutorial. Subbed. Hey do you suggest using Selenium for making a twitter scraper from ground-up (like Tweepy). I saw your tweepy video and plan to making similar script for Twitter, but using Selenium.
True pessimism is not invoking the bot at all and coding it yourself.
Yeah, the /.\\System Files (x86) files on Windows
Go for it man !! Tweepy is a Python library whereas Selenium is a browser mocking tool for testing webpages. I would recommend tweepy because it is fast and reliable. More specifically it is built for connecting to Twitter. If you don't have the credentials, then you can go for Selenium. But then again it's also a matter of tool preference.
I agree, but what about Razer Synapse then? I can say that its doing almost the same thing.

I wish I could use light themes, as my reading comprehension feels like it improves a little with 'em. Do you use them for this reason, or is it just habit? Sadly I have a couple floaters in my eyeballs that become very apparent when looking at bright surfaces, so I keep to dark themes. Upside to dark themes is the colored fonts become more apparent, and it's a little easier to process 'blocks' of code (easier to skim-read the code or recognize relevant sections faster, but really one should be using search functions for that).
This is why I like the kernel style guide. It says 80 chars, unless it's less readable if you split it up. Unfortunately many people interpret that to mean... setup the linter to error on over 80 regardless. There are many cases (tables of registers, lots of lines that look similar) where going a little bit over is nicer than splitting off that one line and now the 2 lines stick out like a sore thumb compared to the other lines that weren't.
Looks cool ! Can you do it with a reduced directory tree ?

/r/LearnPython And because of how the page is set up and the '523' being the title of the span as well as the information inside of it, it's probably best to just go with your current method then just use a string function to remove the unwanted text as `Current Guide Price` will always be there. Something like `string = CGP[21:]` or turn the string into a list and remove the first three elements and print last one `['Current' 'Guide' 'Price' '523']`

There is no beginning and there is no order to learn things into. Things will just come to you as you discover problems, find and implement solutions. You can go all the way through things step by step, but you wont really understand how to use most of the knowledge, until you actually start using it. Top to bottom or bottom to top, all that really matters is that you maintain a context of what you learn, and actually become capable of reusing it with further things that you learn. It really doesn't matter where you start, provided that you start somewhere.

I've always been curious as to how real-time wallpaper apps like Wallpaper Engine works. Constantly rewriting the background file would be too slow since it file i/o would have high overhead. And also how the app handles interactive wallpapers where it would handle clicks. 
Hi! Regarding documentation, yes, we're always working on making it better :) At the moment Plotly Express only supports faceting, not subplots with different axes, although this is possible with the underlying Plotly.py library which supports arbitrary subplots: https://plot.ly/python/subplots/ Your table/brushing idea is interesting, and would likely be best implemented with Plotly's Dash library: https://dash.plot.ly/ Re your last request, you will have to create a new column that contains the data you want to plot: Plotly Express is intended to handle the display of the data rather than its processing at the moment, although for simple scalings I might consider extending the API someday.

No specific reason, I happened to be working with spotify api and this one was something that branched off of that.
 guess = int(input("Guess again!:") OP is trying to use `input("Guess again!:")` which should print `Guess again!:` to the screen and then wait for user input, returned as a string, upon which OP is calling int(). Real issue there is that int() needs a closing paren. guess = int(input("Guess again!:"))
&gt;you cannot convert the string 'guess again' to an int. where do you see them trying to do so? Apart from missing closing parentheses and messed up indentation - totally valid code.
Missing a parenthesis.

&gt; Because threading runs on a single CPU, it is good at speeding up some tasks but not all tasks. Tasks that require heavy CPU computation and spend little time waiting for external events will not run faster with threading, so you should look to multiprocessing instead. Wrong (or at least inaccurate). Python threads are not limited to a single CPU. CPython has a global interpreter lock (GIL) which protects some internals of the CPython interpreter (e.g. object reference counting) and prevents multiple threads to interact with the CPython VM at the same time. This in fact limits CPU bound Tasks that are implemented in pure Python, but libraries implemented in C (numpy, opencv, PILLOW, ...) can release the GIL and allow other threads to run while performing CPU or IO bound workloads. Multiprocessing is only useful if you have CPU bound tasks implemented mostly in Python. For IO bound tasks, or tasks that spend most of their CPU time inside optimized C-libraries, threads are fine. I find it strange that an article specifically about python threading gets this wrong. 
Interesting! I personally did not know that! So threading to access sqlalchemy, for examples, would be the same as launching a subprocess? 
Database access is IO bound (you are waiting for the Database most of the time), so threads are fine anyway. 
Last time I checked it was very much not mature. Toga (the gui lib) isn't fully implemented for windows, so no good for cross-platform apps. VOC (java transpiler) says its experimental. Batavia (python VM in JS) explicitly says early alpha not for production. Colosseum (CSS via python) seems abandonned. Various links from the github pages are to broken webpages (old website?), so doesn't look like the admin side is getting much attention either. Seems like it was just too ambitious to me, so has gotten to a lot of partly working libs then volunteer enthusiasm waned.

Get the paths from arguments, see argparse. Passing variables into your functions makes them more testable. Learn how to create tests using unittest, it is a most valuable skillset.

I've been learning about the pandas and numpy packages. Anyone have any experience with these? I was wondering what the most common keywords are when handling dataframes.
Thanks! It's too bad there isn't a better solution. Actually, what I would really, really like is to be able to run a python local webserver and a web-based GUI. If all I cared about were desktop apps, that is how I would do it but you really can't do that on mobile and I do not want to assume I will have an internet connection to host it elsewhere. oh well. I guess it is Kivy or learn another language (probably just Swift to do it "right" but maybe some of the node tools since they exist for other platforms)

When did you clone the repo, I just made a modification and it would suck if I introduced a new bug. 'NoneType' object has no attribute shape sounds like the image isn't loading. Are you pathing the image correctly? Do you know which line is producing this error. I also welcome you to ask questions on the github if other errors arise.

i downloaded the zip about five minutes ago and the exact error is this Traceback (most recent call last): File "C:\Users\na\Desktop\VaporWaveArt-master\VaporWaveArt-master\main.py", line 208, in &lt;module&gt; height,width,depth = img.shape AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'shape' &amp;#x200B;
im also using the default image test 9 i think
also i downloaded the zip i didnt clone it. If that makes a difference. Sorry new to github
Yeah, that's pretty early in the code, which suggest to me your image is not opening. You're certain the image address is correct?
its the defualt one so i think so this is it img = cv2.imread("testImgs/testface9.png") &amp;#x200B;
this error comes as well dunno if i mentioned it line 194, in eyeDrag for itr in range(0,numGlitches): TypeError: 'numpy.float64' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
Source: https://github.com/chuiizeet/BOTW-Maps-TSP
&gt;height,width,depth = img.shape can you try opening the image right before this line? Just a good sanity check to make sure the image is in fact loading. I'm having difficulty recreating the problem on my end. You can place this code right before the line: `cv2.namedWindow("pic",cv2.WINDOW_NORMAL)` `cv2.imshow("pic",img)` &amp;#x200B;
If you just need to create a file that you're later going to reopen, use `pathlib.Path.touch`.
i just had a feeling it was something to do with that file because mine has been polluted before, happy that you got it fixed!
I changed the code to this #load main image from local file img = cv2.imread("testImgs/testface9.png") cv2.namedWindow("pic",cv2.WINDOW_NORMAL) cv2.imshow("pic",img) height,width,depth = img.shape First time i ran it it worked but on the second time i got this cv2.imshow("pic",img) cv2.error: OpenCV(4.0.0) C:\\projects\\opencv-python\\opencv\\modules\\highgui\\src\\window\_w32.cpp:1230: error: (-215:Assertion failed) [dst.data](https://dst.data) == (uchar\*)dst\_ptr in function 'cvShowImage' &amp;#x200B; i dont even know what it means &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
And then it worked again And then after that i got the original error
Great question. We actually use Docker on the backend, so the host machine that actually runs the computation does not need any kind of special configuration. It simply needs to have our product installed, and accept you as a "Friend."
I would highly recommend looking at "PuLP" library. I used it for a course one time for linear programming and it was excellent. I'll link to the documentation and an example from one of my courses.

This is odd. What version of OpenCV are you using? I [found this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54370220/cv2-error-opencv4-0-0-error-215assertion-failed-dst-data-uchardst) in regards to the previous problem. I wonder if this is a system problem. Are you properly closing images after you run the script? How are you running the script? The lack of consistency here is bothering me XD
im using IDLE and now it seems to open the plain image with no affects and im using open cv version 4.0.0

I totally agree, python is a really powerful language. By the way people shouldn't have opinions on everything; maybe they just prefer scala or ruby and they just don't like python for no reason.

I'm trying to figure out how to take a map of my small hometown and map property ownership data to the physical map of our town I plan on displaying on a website. I have all the data in a csv file, and I can figure out how to process it and all that jazz. I guess I'm not sure how to visualize the data. In my head, I see someone hovering their mouse over the owner's name on the website and every property on the map of my hometown is highlighted for them as well as a listing of what proportion of all property in my city this amounts to. Any tips are appreciated, but I'm also working on it pretty hard. Good luck to everyone!
This is beyond science.
Oh hey while I have your attention: I noticed the numGlitches gets iterated on but is sometimes a float. It was an easy fix by just casting it to an int(). I also noticed that the eyedrag feature is not working quite right becuase the img is a 3d array but spliced as if it is 2d. Otherwise fantastic project, definitely will be vapor waving my buddies profile pics :D

Is this what you mean On line 190 adding an int numGlitches = int(eye\[2\]/strp) or im i completely wrong
That's not really the same usage / target. Plotly aim to produce an interactive plot in JS (that can be displayed in a notebook or in plotly website) when matplotlib is more designed to create static plots. The closest Plotly contender is the pyviz ecosystem (Bokeh for low level / holoviews and hvplot for high-level).
From the page you linked: `The easiest way to install the library is from PyPi using pip, a package manager for Python.

Darn, I thought the type cast would solve the numpy error. I don't think it has anything to do with the 3d stuff. I'll think about what else it could be. When it worked the other five times. Did it ever use the eyeDrag function? I'm wondering if it is just that effect that is causing problems.
I would try taking out the map function. I don't see why that is nessacary when you are using a for loop and creating the index to be accessed. 
Sorry im not quite sure it did the face drag a few times and all the other pictures showed up but im not sure about the eye drag.
Maybe I'm missing something - but there's not interactivity in these examples. I know you can make bar charts just fine with matplotlib - probably maps too, but I dunno how. I imagine there's some higher level plotly tools available. Got any good examples?
Under His Eye
For now you can try to just comment out the area in main where the eyedrag function gets called. Just remove it as an option. Ill think about what the problem might be.
I'm trying to put together some intelligent agents that will publish transactions and award individuals based on specific transaction criteria (currency or certificate), while also presenting a metrics dashboard to highlight trends and constraints.

Lots of countries have laws about minors working full time so you might be restricted by that. It will help if you can demonstrate your skills, maybe by having a personal project you can show off, or having your code included in an open source project.
Okay I‚Äôll look into it. Thanks. 
This often depends upon the country and what is legal labor wise. Frankly it can vary by state in the USA. Programming isn‚Äôt inherently dangerous so I could imagine it being OK at your age but I‚Äôm not a lawyer. It has been decades since I‚Äôve looked for part time work so I really don‚Äôt have much to offer. At one time it was possible to pick up work at a computer store. Even if programming is only part of your job at such an establishment you will learn a lot of business and life related skills so see if any local stores will bite. 
That‚Äôs sounds like a great idea. Thank you. 
Finally someone uses their programming skills for good instead of evil.
As others have said it depends on your locality to some degree, but most companies I've worked with won't hire under 18 because they require NDA agreements (which minors cannot legally enter in many places). 
Oh okay. 
Can I suggest a different approach? &amp;#x200B; Instead of picking a random biome from a list, fill each block of the map with random values for some variables, like dryness between 30 and 70 (of 0 - 100 scale), flora (same scale as dryness), spread pattern (circular, diagonal \[left up, left down, right up, right down\], directional \[left, up, right, down\]). &amp;#x200B; Then you modify a X% of the blocks with a biome seed, for example dessert: center get dryness increased by 50, spreads twice following the direction, first spread increases dryness on 40, second on 25. &amp;#x200B; Then you just define the biome using the variables, like dryness over 80 is desert, desert block with flora over 70 is oasis. &amp;#x200B; The code is going to be more complex, but I think the result may end looking more natural &amp;#x200B;
An NDA for spot work (like you'd get on freelancer or upwork) are pretty worthless, I'd say. 
Yeah it use to be a thing in some places. How much success you will have depends upon two things the laws in your state and finding a computer store that is actually profitable and can afford to hire you. To put it mildly it isn‚Äôt the same environment for computer stores compared to 20 to 30 years ago. If that doesn‚Äôt work out don‚Äôt give up! Another avenue is to volunteer at a charity of some sort. While it doesn‚Äôt pay it gets you out in the world and in contact with people that might be in a position to hire down the road. 
I didn‚Äôt even think of that. Thanks. 
Not sure what you mean by stream processor, but [kafka-python](https://github.com/dpkp/kafka-python) is a great Python library for consuming from Kafka topics in a streaming fashion.
Freelance work could be a good option you would just need to be upfront with your age due to differing laws. It might be a better idea to try and make some of your own more advanced projects that you could show a future employer, because from my experience showing previous work you are proud of will be highly beneficial to you in the future. 
So your saying try and work on a big project I could show to kind of further qualify me? Do you have any suggestions as to what?
I'd say your best shot, considering things like child labor laws and all that, would be freelancing or starting your own business (nothing big though - basically building something that might turn into something that might at some point make a bit more money than it costs you to run it, and if you manage to do that, you take it from there). I doubt any proper employer would hire you - not just because a year of self-taught Python isn't all that impressive, but really mostly because hiring 14-year-olds is generally a huge hassle, if you can do it legally at all. Also, why are you so keen on entering the workforce? At your age, you are in a unique position to suck up knowledge and skills for free, without the burden of all those responsibilities that come with adult life. Getting paid to write code is great, but it's also just a job, and sometimes it sucks. Hard. You have plenty of time to experience that in a few years.
getting involved in open source is a great way of professionalizing your skills. most of them have a modern ci/cd process, tests are required, good coding style, etc. all of the repos i'm involved with our either cloud or healthcare based, but i'm sure there's something going on in open source around your interests
It really depends what sort of work you're trying to get into. Others have mentioned the age thing. If you're intending to do real, professional programs, projects and such, you could do this, after talking to a lawyer. Look at your parents spinning up an LLC. It's pretty easy, and most states will do it in the area of $100-$300. There are a lot of labor laws that can be bypassed with a family business. That said, this is jurisdictionally dependent, I'm not a lawyer, and I'm not your lawyer. I'd be curious what you are using to base your self-assessment off of. I was surprised on one of the Talk Python or Python Bytes podcast episodes to hear when GvR was interviewing at Google, they asked him to rate himself in Python on a 1-10 scale. He said either a 7 or 8. Beyond that, Python is a huge ecosystem, are you looking at embedded, data analytics, web backend, service creation, or something else? So, I'd first look at what field(s) you're interested in. You're pretty young, I'd really hesitate from shoe horning yourself into any niche field. Just concentrate on getting a really broad base, outside of Python as well. Second, look at the market for those jobs, and how they're obtained. Last, talk to legal counsel on how to make it legal.
I‚Äôll be honest, my family doesn‚Äôt have a lot of money and considering my interest in computers, programming, and gaming aren‚Äôt really a cheap hobbies. I think that working would provide me the opportunity to open up a whole new world of gaming and programming. 
Wow okay. Thanks. Looks like I have a little bit of research to do before I jump into the deep end.
Optimization is one of the topics Python is pretty hot for. Often, the optimization code is written in C/++ with the python bindings being the preferred usage. There is [scipy optimize](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html) (see the minimize function) which is usually the jumping off point. CVXOPT = "Convex Opt" -- (local) solvers like Nelder-Meade, BFGS, etc, for solving convex problems. For nonconvex problems (i.e., ones with multiple minima) you need a global solver (simulated annealing, metropolis-hastings, etc). [Pyswarms](https://pyswarms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) gives you particle swarm optimizers. [Mystic](https://pypi.org/project/mystic/) is quite similar to scipy.optimize.minimize, with a very different interface.
Sure. DM away
I support this, although it could be an issue if OP wants to earn money.
Yeah the eyedrag modifier will throw an error if it gets called. I was playing around with it to try to get it to work but I was at work so couldn't really figure out exactly what was going on :P
Its because the author of the blog put images in the page instead of embedding the output of plotly as an iframe. All those images are actually interactive. 
Sorry but i'm not sure i understand, for example, Python is installed on D:\\Softwares\\Python. and the [khinsider.py](https://khinsider.py) is located on D:\\Softwares\\Python. What am i supposed to do exactly? I have run the [khinsider.py](https://khinsider.py) first time i got the file, it did installed stuff i think. But whenever i run it again it closes it. And when i run python.exe, i'm not too sure of what i'm supposed to do exactly. &amp;#x200B; Any idea? 
Got a github?
This is very admirable, but make sure you continue to focus on your studies. Your earnings now will be peanuts compared to what you can make with a college degree in CS, but to get there, you gotta finish HS strong.
Oooh thank you very much, I will try this, but its still bugging me why this isn't working. I think I will delete most of the code and do it your way. Thanks! Also, this would require multiple 2d lists, right?
Thanks for the suggestions, that's basically what I was wondering. I get the impression many of these are written in C or C++ as well. Cool pyswarms package, glad to get the input
[original link](https://www.quickcode.co/learning-guide/learn-python-guide) of python programming guide
I am following sentdex's tutorials for the GTA V self driving car except that I am using GTA SA instead and I am improving some aspects of the original code he wrote. Pretty basic but keep following tutorials until you start making them! Lol!
Nope, a 2D list where every item is a dictionary should be fine you could even make your own class for the map squares... Give me 15 minutes to setup a python env and we can talk over DMs if you want
Pyswarms is a mixed bag. It has really good branding and provides an awesome functionality, but the examples in the docs don't run, it has a weird call signature, and the performance is not so amazing.
A variable is called map. I later changed this to world_map.
Can you provide a little explanation of what this is? I'm new to Python and like LoZ. Thanks!

TSP is a very famous problem of combinational optimization, visit all the points and return to the beginning to know the best route. In this case, use the LoZ maps to put it into practice.
Why would there be slower deploys, though? It should only download and apply each layer once. That‚Äôs the whole point of docker.
TSP stands for Traveling Salesman Problem, btw
Good to know. Out of curiosity, do you know of one that implements simulated annealing? That that recently came up in class and strikes me as an interesting concept.
"basinhopping" from scipy.optimize is also called metropolis-hastings, which is a superset of simulated annealing. The default behavor of basinhopping is precisely simulated annealing, I believe (temp reduces over time).
Have a look at Qt. There are various Python bindings, PyQt, Pyside and you can use QtDesigner to build your GUI using drag and drop. Your GUI is stored in an XML file, this file can be loaded directly (from Python) or converted to Python code.
Hmm, what version of OpenCV are you using. I think you're the second person to run into this error. I cannot recreate the problem with my setup, which leads me to believe its a version thing. &amp;#x200B;
who's gonna livestream it?
Looks (from the gif) like it is just measuring random paths. Did you actually try solving the TSP? (On mobile...I didn‚Äôt look at your code...)

Try out Django. It's super easy. The book Python Crash Course has a great Django section to get you started with getting a website up quick 
I would check out Google's [OR-Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization/). It has built-in solvers for integer/linear programming as well as custom solvers for constraint programming, assignment, routing, scheduling and general network flows. Has options for swapping out the default solvers for your own. &amp;#x200B; It's written in C++ with a decent python wrapper, although it's a bit lacking in python documentation and not 1:1 feature parity with C++. They have a bunch of great examples in their [github repo](https://github.com/google/or-tools) as well as an active [forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/or-tools-discuss) with answers by the developers, so it's quite easy to get up and running quickly.
This is assuming that the cost is proportional to distance between these landmarks. The parasail portion I would believe, but that typically gets you far less than 1/4 of the way to the next tower. The rest depends on climbing and enemy avoidance.
Tinker.io is an online python thingy
Repl.it is good and pythonanywhere is good for flask, django, etc. 
Also you could use pyomo - it‚Äôs effectively a wrapper for any of the optimization tools you noted (Gurobi, cplex, etc.)
Repl.it seems like a good one, do you know if there's a way to update pip on it? I can't access smtplib
[https://codeanywhere.com](https://codeanywhere.com) has a free tier. Browser-based IDE, runs code in containers, Github integration. Kinda neat. 
Love when art intersects with tech.
Might want to do some optimisation, it's clearly not an optimal path
You could see whether pycharm works as a [Linux app](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9145439?hl=en).
I used Dataquest and loved it. Focus is more on data science, but it‚Äôs mostly built around Python.
python anywhere is a bit harder to use but gives you a full environment with a shell, and can install modules.
Hey there, so I came up with an idea and would like your input (I hope the offer still stands!) I like the NBA and statistics. I would like to build a program to extract stats from a website, store them in a spreadsheet, and ideally use a Tkinter program to display this info. So I could have like buttons on the program where I click and it would load the data from the web and display live stats for all the teams, and players... etc. in like text boxes. Could you help me with this? Thank you so much in advance! &amp;#x200B;
scipy is easy to get and has a few reasonably good algorithms cvxopt is good, if applicable there's also bindings to ipopt, a mature open source interior point algorithm
I think the problem is here. `for c in cnt or []` Sorry, I have to admit I haven't used cv2 much but why have you amended the code in github to the above? Anyway, the issue is trying to evaluate OR here with the elements of cnt and an empty list...I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to do here by adding or [], but if you try to evaluate logical OR with numpy arrays, it will give you this error message because evaluating arrays in boolean contexts is ambiguous, e.g. do you want to do bitwise AND, do you want TRUE if all elements are TRUE, do you want TRUE if at least one element is true? There are different ways to evaluate each of these cases depending on which you want, but that's what the problem is.
Let's be honest: Who uses the latest version in production? Or anywhere really except for like a small script. Because no library will be compatible yet 
Thank you for the advice. Funny thing is I bought that book a while back but for got about it as things kept piling up. Now that I am done making my wife a website for her nail salon (made my own web server via AWS and installed WordPress on it) I and going to focus on Python more and Django.

aiui conda's killer feature is handling sys / native deps better than anything else out there: when I install any given non-diligently-selfcontained-bdist/wheel c wrapper from pip I generally expect it to expect the (*correct version* of the) native lib it's wrapping to be already present and compilable against on the system, and when it goes out of its way to bundle it and its deps and their build voodoo manually it's a pleasant surprise usually only reserved for tiny or extraordinarily popular libs. conda on the other hand goes far out of its way to dutifully support and package and distribute the direct and transitive native deps of everything it claims to cover, with the escape hatch to 'raw' pip for what it doesn't. a tangible result of this being a bare, fresh, depless conda env being hundreds of megs compared to every other venv-powered env being tens (due to it fanatically controlling every sys dep of even the bare interpreter itself) - but another tangible result of this being the more obscure mathy libs out there with a few hundred users half written in c++ with their own native deps are vastly more likely to work (or at least be closer to working) in conda than pip if they are officially supported, and if they aren't at the least more work has gone into making the reasons they aren't working more tooled and transparent (raw setup.py extension compilation failure will generally just spit out opaque partial compiler errors and basically expect you to be the original author). regarding poetry and pipenv and such none of these discriminate themselves against distutils/setuptools remotely to the degree that conda does - they just aim to simplify and flatten the very obvious jenga tower of disgusting backcompat and monkeypatched hacks and general garbage of distutils/setuptools that while admirable and backcompatible is imo not 'better enough' to be worth departure from the standard gross setup.py, whereas conda is the only one that tackles the actual hard problem of sys/native-deps at the cost of obscurity and overhead. tl;dr: I agree with your assessment that as binwheels get more popular the value add of conda decreases, but conda will continue to provide value for users of more obscure and deppy native-powered libs as is common in fringe numerical code. as a person very stingy with deps raw pip usually does all i need but i won't hesitate to reach for conda when simple pip won't work, and as an already beaten down author of setup.pys pipenv and friends are just more brittle moving parts not yet worth my time.
If I'm you I'm looking for a gig that is more 70/30, 60/40, 50/50 your other skillset / programming and transitioning that way over the next couple years. Night classes for 2 years and 200% more income through the door still seems like a better alternative to me. No way would I take minimum wage for 4 months and then a 50% pay cut for another 20 months. Good luck with your decision though, career change is tough once life has gotten it's hooks in you.
Thanks!! Saved me tons of time down the road. 
I'm surprised nobody mentioned it already: Jupyterlab. https://jupyter.org/try Notebooks are wildly popular these days, and Jupyterlab seems poised to take off as well. 
For a patch version? If it breaks compatibility there‚Äôs a bigger problem at play.
I grew up in Boise, ID and know there are a good number of companies that hire interns over the summer so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd shoot for if you live near there. I interned at Clearwater analytics and scentsy summer after HS and summer after first year of college. Had great mentors who were very patient... and I learned a lot. I don‚Äôt know age requirements, but worked when I was 14/15 at BSU‚Äôs summer camp (unrelated to CS) so it‚Äôs likely reasonable to work in summer. You may also be able to work out something with your school and the company to work as a course or joint project. If that doesn‚Äôt work out, don‚Äôt worry, there‚Äôs plenty of time to work for someone else. Best thing you can do is make something that interests you and that you‚Äôre proud of!
I made modifications to the eyeDrag function, you can take a look and see if they help. In regards to tutorials. I wish you would ask me a month from now. I'm working on some tutorials right now. I would however recommend [LearnOpenCV](https://www.learnopencv.com/) and [PyImageSearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/). They're both opencv focused blogs. If you want to actually learn the math and concepts behind image processing and computer vision, I highly recommend you start with this [video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhDlL-tLT2U&amp;list=PLuh62Q4Sv7BUf60vkjePfcOQc8sHxmnDX). These were made by my professor at university. He does everything in matlab, but the concepts translate directly to opencv or any CV framework for that matter.
Jupyter is great, but OP is looking for a pycharm replacement. 
**Jupyterlab** is what I'm suggesting, not Jupyter. It can work as a PyCharm replacement depending on what specifically OP is trying to do. 
tl;dr use pip unless you can't. I use a few libraries with nasty C++ dependencies which pip can't manage because C++ packaging is terrible.
You can also add `input('press enter to close')` to make the drawing stay on the screen after. 
Sure! I will keep you posted. Thanks for your work. 
This is the new ipsom lorem I am envisioning a framework where you provide some company/product vector art, photographs and slogans and BAM! Your vapereave based website or advert collateral is delivered! I expect to see a meme generator using this shortly.
Yeah I've recently done something that scrapes the first paragraph of a given wikipedia page with beautifulsooup. It seems to take a lot longer than simply going to the website in my browser though...
I believe OP can install Jupyter Notebook with Anaconda-Navigator on their chrome OS. It might be a bit of a hassle but doable and efficient nonetheless. 
VSCode. You won‚Äôt regret it. A ton of plugins and language support. I can‚Äôt imagine my life without it
I second Repl.it, they've got plenty of other languages too!

Qt creator and Wx both have one.
Can you dual boot to Linux? Could get PyCharm on that. I have no experience with ChromeOS, so forgive if it's a stupid question.
&gt; All that being said, is there any "killer feature(s)" of Anaconda to consider? It comes with certain numerical routines linked against Intel MKL libraries by default (e.g. fft, blas). It's possible (albeit not trivial) to replicate this yourself by building from source. That being said, conda never made sense to me on linux/osx, and was at best a necessary evil on windows due to the hassle of finding/compiling all of the dependencies yourself. Since binary dependencies are now allowed in wheels for all platforms, IMHO it's really superfluous in almost every use case.
Did you start in corporate accounting or public? And did you learn all your programming skills from online resources or did you have a degree in it as well? 
A couple links deep is https://software.intel.com/en-us/distribution-for-python which says its software requirements are Windows, Linux, or Mac OS so in theory yes?
Thanks for the link. I'm just wondering why someone would want to turn this off.

Same here! About to go from Physics Major &gt;&gt; Lab Assistant &gt;&gt; QA Engineer &gt;&gt; Software Engineer! Unofficially turning my job from QA Engineer to QA Automation Engineer to get out of manually testing things was such a good idea and a great way to make a boring job a lot more entertaining and educational (right up until I had most of it automated, anyway). I was able to comfortably answer design questions in a few interviews after having had to design so much from scratch. I love the advice of it making it your second job with Python. I‚Äôd never thought of it that way, but it‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôve done too. 
Good to hear, best of luck!!
How much money do you have saved up? If enough for a few months, my personal suggestion would be to just learn for a month and then go to meetups and such. Learning interpreted language like python/JavaScript is easier because you don't have to go through a build process and it is easier to see tangible output right away via REPL. At least try learning by yourself for a week. If you are interested, I can Skype you for an hour and you can ask me any question. Of course, no strings attached.

What commands do you write exactly in the console? It should look something like this ` khinsider.py --format flac mother-3 ` as stated in the README in github. My best guess right now is that you don't have the python in your PATH variables.See how to add it here: [How do I add Python to the Windows PATH?](https://superuser.com/questions/143119/how-do-i-add-python-to-the-windows-path) After that you may run it like `python khinsider.py --format flac mother-3` and it should 'do' something. 
Absolutely :)
As I can‚Äôt see what‚Äôs inside any of your classes I can‚Äôt possibly have any idea what‚Äôs going on, and neither can anyone else. Show us all your code, then describe _previsely_ what you‚Äôre doing to run it at the command line, followed by what output does get printed, and then describe what you expected to happen. Also generally don‚Äôt have all your classes have the exact same name as your module, both `from reddit import reddit` and `import reddit; reddit.reddit()` are awkward and will instantly make it harder to tell if you‚Äôre dealing with a module, a function within a module, or a class within a module. Using PEP-8 naming conventions eliminates this ambiguity.

I am not currently on PC right now and I will update my post with a function example. Basically the function is just doing some process and creating a file. When it is done, it will just print a line ‚Äòhey i am done‚Äô. There is no return being made back to the main.py file

Basic control flow in Python: functions and methods _always_ return, if they don‚Äôt themselves either infinitely loop or crash the interpreter via raising an exception. If there‚Äôs no explicit **return** statement the function/method returns None implicitly at the end of its body, returning control flow to the place the function/method was called from.

The interpreter is compiled in machine code. The easiest way to answer this without knowing about the interpreter is to examine the other options and eliminate them. The keyboard doesn't contain any code, it's just hardware that sends signals to the computer for it to interpret. The python source file contains python code (it's important to know that python code isn't machine code tho). The word document contains no code (at least, none that would be possible to run from there, ie, you could type `print("Hello world!")` in a word document, but that's not code in the same sense)

This is a common pattern to iterate over a variable that might be null, without explicitly checking it first. In Python, `null or X` returns X, even if it is also false. The for-loop would silently skip the empty list instead of throwing an error if `cnd` happens to be null.
In very general terms, logging to a text file is much faster than logging to a database. That's the main aspect of logging I am considering. The reason to log to a DB is more likely to be because I want to query the results - searching for particular log info is easier in a DB, particularly if you log contextual information that can be used to group log entries together. It is also usually easier to access a central DB than a log file on a server which may be secured and not accessible. The Unix toolset offers plenty of similar querying with find, grep, and cat'ing to a new file. The ideal would be to log locally to a file, and then migrate this data to a DB for inspection if needed afterwards. But for my sake, in experienced enough in Unix to skip that. Now auditing is a different beast altogether. While it is similar in concept to logging, audit is usually needed to be kept for a long time (unlike log files used for debugging or tracing that may be deleted at a whim). Audits are there to show important information. You log far less audit information and less often than normal logging so performance is not a concern. Its for this reason that the advantages of writing this audit info to a central DB are seen. I won't be auditing my work AFAIK.
The problem is that it is not a just a piece of code it is a whole engine with a bunch of code. And pretty much each part of it plays a role. I cannot post the whole code. All I could do was to describe the problem &amp;#x200B;

Yeh it‚Äôs probably not all that solved in its current state
That is awesome! There's some great results in there too (and I'm sure some not-so-great ones in the archives).
Nice work. It's great to see such creativity.
Scientists, statistitians, occasional commerce, and pretty much everyone else.
1. /r/learnpython 2. Your code absolutely does not do what it's supposed to do. What have you tried? Why do you think it's not working?
Joined! Is there a list of things that will be covered, can you please share that
If we were talking about a minor version bump (such as 3.8.0 when it comes out), then sure, but patch versions are typically no brainers. If you were on 3.7.2, 3.7.3 should just bring bug fixes and security patches. You need security patches.

I've been programming for the last two years now and I'm ashamed to ask, but isn't VSCode an IDE and if not, what is it exactly? What is the difference?
one of option: [code-server](https://github.com/codercom/code-server)
Btw you simple return output, which is an empty string
Awesome, thanks for the advice, I'll check it out
As there are so few points maybe brute forcing is an option? Just go through all the possibilities and select the shortest. 
I have already shared the whole udemy lecture courses on basic python,data science and machine learning..you can check the classroom for the google drive link.
VS Code is an editor. it's confusing because there's lots of similarities between editors and IDE's, but it's mostly about features. it's probably better described as a spectrum with pure text editors on one end with IDEs on the other editors are very slim by default with little functionality other than just editing text, but editors for programming almost always have plugin systems that allow you to tack on more functionality. IDEs are feature dense by default. they come with just about all the tools a software developer will need and are generally more sophisticated and honed for a specific platform. they will often have plugin systems too by adding lots of plugins, editors become very close approximations to IDE, but with each plugin, the editor becomes slower and bulkier, negating the original appeal of editors over IDEs. another thing to consider is plugin quality from the various plugin vendors I eventually got sick of managing all the plugins, especially for fresh installs or helping someone get set up (things are probably easier now). and realized a full-fledged IDE already does what I need it to plus a whole lot more 
You can run it locally. It's the same as running Jupyter notebook. Technically you're hosting it locally though
Honestly most people looking for an IDE might settle well with VSCode. If it's not enough for OP uninstall and look elsewhere.
Anaconda comes with Spyder IDE. Try that and maybe VSCode. We're not so sure what features you need and if you need all features that PyCharm provides.
I don't think your code is doing what you think it's doing. Have you looked at existing list methods to see if there's an existing way to do this?
Are you expecting us to do your homework?
vim ^(/me runs)
13! = 6,227,020,800 Still quite a few calculations.
Maybe use C here
Programming is expensive at all, all you need is a computer, and it doesn't even have to be a super fancy one. Gaming can get expensive, but if you're on a budget, sticking with older titles that will run fine on mediocre hardware goes a long way. I doubt the extra money would truly open up a breathtaking new world to you. Becoming a professional programmer might, but that new world isn't a rose garden. It's one of the best jobs in the world, but it's also still a job, and sometimes it sucks really really badly. Sorry to disappoint you, but I don't think your ideas are realistic at all. A few thought as to how to proceed. 1. Continue your self-learning journey. You've only just begun, and you'll need to learn more before you're truly hireable. Spend the next 5-10 years getting really good at programming, and you will have little trouble finding employment as a programmer. 2. Focus on your education. A self-taught programming career is possible, but a college degree, *any* college degree, even if it's in jazz music (like mine), is a huge advantage. 3. Internships can be useful as long as they don't interfere with your education. Summer internships for example can work out great. 4. If you really need to earn some money right now, consider a job like customer support or software tester. They're not programming jobs, but you'll get a foot in the door, and your chances of scoring a paid job are much much higher. Plus they'll teach you a lot about how the industry works.
OP explicitly asked for an IDE
Isn't it a complete overkill to call "machine learning" the fitting of a straight line to a series of data points?
[Here's a screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/A3dbjCb.png). I just started learning Python so that's why it's so terrible. All it does is give you an entry box to type in the link, then it shows you the available format codes, and you type the format code you want to download. I think it needs youtube-dl and ffmpeg installed before you use it.
Best to put it on Github. Nobody will download that file. 
 &gt;&gt;&gt; listToString = lambda l: repr(l).strip('[]').replace("\x27", '').replace(",", ", and") &gt;&gt;&gt; listToString(['apples', 'bananas', 'tofu', 'cats']) 'apples, and bananas, and tofu, and cats' You should turn this in, it outputs correctly 100% of the time and will definitely get top marks.

The killer feature of conda is the ability to manage / package non-python code. e.g. C/C++ libraries. Given so many scientific libs/apps depend on non-python compiled code (be it C++ / fortran / whatever), this is really the reason for conda's existence. Neither pip nor any of the other python build/library managers addressed this problem so the scientific python community created conda to meet their needs (as directed by the ex-BDFL who said "go forth a make your own solution" ... or something like that). &amp;#x200B; Also, If a conda binary for your platform doesn't already exist, it's quite easy to make your own and upload to your own channel on anaconda-cloud. This makes further deployments trivial.
Corey Schafer
Thanks for this. I just started Python and this is just what I needed.
Sweet.
To add further to this, conda also makes it easy to create multiple python environments with different python versions that are 100% independent of any system-python. Python itself is "just another package" to conda.
What do you mean, it doesn't work. The article you linked seems to be more on how to use chocolatey then setting up Python itself. The command I shared is the built-in way of installing packages, and most definitely DOES work, also on Windows.
release info: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-373/ changelog: https://docs.python.org/3.7/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-7-3-final
Will definitely check him out and thanks for the insights. 
This is deep and sweet. Have an upvote!
But my point of putting this guy here is not for his tips and techniques to write python codes. We will get such channels and contents in thousands over Internet. This guy makes me think what the actual programming is. Why we write codes and the psychology behind all the computer programming languages. He motivates me to think. He shares lots of day to day hardship faced by a beginner and comes up with his solutions. He also reviews books for data science and machine learning which is simply mind blowing. I would recommend you to check his contents for once. Thank you. 
Do check him out for the insights on how programming actually works. 
Is this satire? Why is nobody laughing? What's going on?
Nice Steins;Gate reference in the code
This is amazing. You faced the challenge, empowered yourself and took control of your own life. Congratulations - I wish you all the prosperity possible.
Exactly. Pick a minor version if you‚Äôre very careful of stability and support, and then install all patches. If you‚Äôre afraid a patch will break functionality, then you shouldn‚Äôt trust that software at all to begin with. 
Have a look at the OP's profile and you might know why 
On the contrary, this is exactly what machine learning has become nowadays. Things like ARIMA would then be deep learning. /s
Are you serious?
I'm confused...
For a moment, my heart warmed up to this. 
Even worse, I count 14 markers
Check their post history. Hilarious and yeah, not a bean farmer's brother. (He's the bean farmer's son. He's only farming beans 'Til the bean farmer comes). ^Sorry, ^couldn't ^resist 
Yeah who needs security fixes in production üòÇ
Hahaha wtf!
Yep but your start doesn't matter. That's why he said 13!
It does because you don't go back to the start, it's not a closed loop. 14 choices for where to begin, 13 choices for step 1, 12 for step 2, ...
The point where you start doesn't matter so technically it's 13!+1. 
Lol. good for you. Grapes of Wrath 2019.
First, it's bad practice to name your list: 'list'. It makes code confusing to anyone that reads it and can actually "break python". NEVER use keywords or built-in function names for variable names. Second, everything in your for loop is very wrong. Even the loop declaration is wrong. Third, your code won't even compile. Consider using python's command line interpreter interactively to figure out the correct syntax. 
My man SENTDEX
Imagine you're trying to calculate the length of a triangle. There is point p1 p2 and p3. What point you start doesn't matter as long as you go through all of the points and go back to the one you started. 
Might wanna check OPs history and rethink that upvote...
Thank you for the explanation. I wasn't expecting such a detailed explanation and I see your point. Things are much clearer now. I really appreciate the effort. 
What the actual fu... Yeah, point taken.
In my opinion it's great that python's typing has so much attention. On the other hand, do we really need *three* alternatives to mypy? There already is Facebook‚Äôs [*pyre-check*](https://github.com/facebook/pyre-check) and Google‚Äôs [*pytype*](https://github.com/google/pytype)*.* And now Microsoft has its own.
Sad but true
That's only true if the loop is closed (ie you visit one node twice). The travelling salesman problem only requires visiting each node once. In your example you could calculate dist(p1, p2) + dist(p2, p3) or dist(p1, p3) + dist(p2, p3). They aren't the same unless 2 sides of the triangle are the same length.
Shouldn't it be (13!+1)/2 because otherwise you would go through the same way in both directions but I'm to dump to figure out how to implement that atm :). Only have my smartphone available now. 
In machine learning you are trying to find a model that best fits to your data so that you can predict the future. Either this involves finding a single parameter (straight line) or a hundred parameters (neural network) the concept is the same. You can also use the same algorithms (e.g. gradient descent).
Esteban? More like Estebean!
same here
I would personally rather use the word "learning" when concepts such as "generalization", "test set", "training set", and "cross validation" are involved. I am convinced it is a hype to call machine learning, simple least-square parametric fitting that can be carried out analytically with the pseudo inverse method. Anyway, linear regression in python is a nice exercise for whoever is beginning a study path in parametric statistics. 
lul
you're welcome. another thing ive noticed is editor users often use multiple gui apps for things like git, an http client, db management, static code analysis, etc. often ides have these tools built in, so switching between them is more seamless and share similar/ familiar interfaces
AWS bought cloud9 which is an interesting IDE in the browser. 
I wish i could upvote this more than once
I can't believe anyone got past "I am a bean salesman..."
Thanks for the feedback! I'll update the [README.md](https://README.md) accordingly. 
I'm looking to get into some business and use Python to automate my workflow, and this post gave me so much hope. Too bad it's just a joke :(
If you don't mind spending some money I can recommend Fred Baptiste's 'Python 3 - Deep Dive' courses on Udemy - you can pick them up for less than $15 each, if you wait for the sales (which run most of the time). Pretty sure a lot of the material won't ever appear in your class - I thought I knew Python reasonably well but a lot of the stuff he goes into, I'd never even thought about (like how data is stored in memory and what that means, or how floats work \[and why 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 == 0.3 returns False\]).
Ahh, I see! Well in that case, /u/rub1xqub3, to incorporate you'll be wanting to adjust the code to something like ` for c in cnt.tolist() or []: c = np.array(c) ... ` 
I'm suuuper confused, lol, OPs history is like a year of shitposting about pissing their pants and wearing diapers, then all the sudden, bam, I'm a Python-using bean farmer. Lol!

Man I love python. I'm learning C++ in my uni but it's a pain in the ass to work with it. I redesigned a [Hearthstone Fatigue Damage Calculator](https://github.com/marioortizmanero/hearthstone-fatigue-calculator) yesterday. For those who don't play HS, fatigue damage is damage dealt after a player runs out of cards. When they draw a card after that, they'll get 1 damage. Then, 2 damage. Then 3. And so on until infinity. The thing is that there's some decks that use lethal damage to kill and it can be a bit annoying to calculate. I had previously done it with loops as it's just a sum, but I learned about the **Trapezoidal numbers** which make it WAY more optimized, and dictionaries, which made the menu simpler. You can learn more in the readme 
It may, but it is machine learning : the algorithm adapt to the input data in order to predict some output. You can use simple interpolation, or neural network... But at the end, they fall into the machine learning category 
I wish there was numpy and scipy for 3.8 already. I would really like to switch to 3.8 because of the doubled speed of class variable writes and reduced overhead of converting arguments passed to many builtin functions and methods.
Yeah you need to go through all points but you don't have to choose a random one to start. Imagine you have found a solution. You could pick any spot in the problem and go through the solution. That would be the shortest possible way. 
Someone recently posted this in python sub for tkinter. You could look into that. [https://github.com/alejandroautalan/pygubu](https://github.com/alejandroautalan/pygubu)
If you are in the beans business, you should use Java instead.
 citing /u/yotamN from [the last pyright thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b4p1f5/pyright_static_type_checker_for_python_from/) "\[node is\] just an unnecessary dependency. It's a lot more likely to have Python installed, especially if you are working on a Python project."
Please don't post questions in this subreddit. /r/learnpython was the correct choice.
My bad. I was told to post in both.
it's called the Dunning-Kruger Effect, and is pretty common in all fields
No you can't because you can only visit each node *once*. Draw out a right triangle, side lengths 3, 4 &amp; 5. The shortest route must start on either end of the hypotenuse. If you start on the right angle corner it's impossible to form the optimal path.
No because you have to visit the start again

A literal bean counter. I love it!
I would prefer then talking about statistical inference then: it removes the aura of mystery around the "I" of AI... I see other disadvantages like having people digging into careers - assuming they will be the new Hinton - with only a programming background and no computer science experience. 
As long as your girlfriend has not baked _all_ the beans, I think you're good to go. Oh brother! that would have been bad.
