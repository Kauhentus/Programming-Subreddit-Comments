&gt; Looks like people were starting to clone it up. I don't really care about stuff like this but I think you got a lot of diehards who believe any action like this pushes us further from an "open internet". I myself do not know how to reconcile disinformation and hate speech One of these things is not like the other.
&gt; But **authority**- that's the key difference. You can't say, "But people will be mean to me if I act like an asshole," and call that "censorship". It makes you look like, well, an *asshole*. &gt; &gt; Why does other people being an asshole to you make you look like an asshole?
You quoted it, but you don't seem to have read it. I get it, it's pretty complicated grammar. Let's rephrase it more clearly: "Saying it's censorship when people are mean to you makes you sound like an asshole."
Created a random encounter generator for Dungeons and Dragons that takes tables of random encounters and rolls them automatically, including tables that have you roll on more tables. It's my first python project and I'm very proud of myself.
...How? Why? Not sure why it's never the bullies who are assholes and always the victims of the bullies according to "loving and tolerant" liberal SJW types.
How? By saying it. Why? Because it's the kind of thing assholes say. The pattern operates thus: Asshole: \*says something bigoted\* Normal people: That's offensive! You shouldn't say that! I'm not going to buy your product/service/etc! Asshole: That's censorship! Do you see how that works?
From experience I can say its much easier to work with the APIs sites like twitter and instagram offer than trying to implement your bot through browser emulation. Only exception being things the API might not offer.

Great project! If you're looking for serious applications, you will have to resolve many things. Some to come to my mind would be - Better encryption. If you try to encrypt black text on white background using this technique, the text would still be perfect in the encrypted image - The size of your encrypted image will be much larger than the size of the original image (since original image got compressed). - Once you send your image over an app like whatsapp / facebook that try to compress your image automatically, you might not be able to decrypt it properly.
My personal favorite that I've been working on is an unbeatable tic tac toe program. It's not done yet, but by a strategy that's easily found online, itll hopefully win or tie every time. It's a small project, but it's a fun one for an intermediate coder
&gt; In practice, is there a difference between inheriting from an interface, and just implementing all the special methods between make up that interface? Seems to me that it's pretty much functionally identical in python, unless you're doing explicit isinstance checks on something. Python doesn't really have explicit interfaces, so no. &gt; the book's examples encourage building your custom dicts by inheriting from dict and userdict, so I'm guessing it's pythonic to do plenty of direct inheritance as well? I would disagree with the book, then. `UserDict` and friends exist today because of residual convenience, not because of some "you have to do this with inheritance" rule. Originally they existed because, way back in the early early days of Python 2, Python had a dual type hierarchy (like the JVM or .NET languages) where some of Python's built-in types were not subclassable. So `UserDict` was "the thing you use when you'd want to subclass `dict`, but this ancient version of Python 2 didn't allow subclassing `dict`" and so on. The Python type hierarchy got unified years and years ago, so it's no longer necessary to do this just to get a subclass of those built-in types. The `UserDict`, `UserList`, etc. classes stuck around because they actually have some utility for use cases *other* than "I want a subclass of the base type" -- effectively, they give you a class that has an instance of that type accessible in an attribute, and sets up the special methods to proxy through to that instance unless you mess with them. So a better but wordier name, if they were being done from scratch today, would be something like `ListWrapperProxy` instead of `UserList`. Unless your use case specifically calls for that, I wouldn't use `UserDict`, `UserList`, etc.
because this is relevant to the sub
I've found object access is slower than dictionary access. Ignore the memory usage until you have an actual need to reduce it. There may not be a way to maintain your speed with a lower memory footprint without leaving python for at least part of the project. That being said I'd try pandas or numpy if first. They are good solutions if they fit your problem.
SIM cards don't really come locked with a PIN code anymore. They used to, but when I recently asked from a shop what the PIN code was for my new SIM, the young chap didn't know what a PIN code was. I had to explain it to him and he had to ask his manager, who didn't know the PIN code and asked me to call a number to find it out.
Why are you posting this here?
- Write to a text/csv file and load the file - doesn't make your code ugly - allows you to change the keywords without changing your code (think of how many git commits you will make if you frequently change your keywords) - allows you to pre-process the keywords - `"make a long string here and then split it".split()` - ``` """ make a long multi-line string and split it """.split() ```

Bigot: *One who is strongly partial to one's own group, religion, race, **or politics** and is intolerant of those who differ.* *A person who is obstinately and unreasonably wedded to a particular religious **or other creed, opinion**, practice, or ritual; a person who is **illiberally attached to any opinion, system of belief, or party organization**; an intolerant dogmatist.* Just because "the dictionary is a white supremacist invention" or whatever stupid excuse doesn't justify people to their own special definitions of words. &gt;Asshole: That's censorship! Nah, I don't see how criticizing the free speech-hating SJWs makes someone an asshole. That's just free speech, just like the """Normal people""" in your example are exercising their free speech, too.

Still working on it, as it's ever growing, but I've a fairly large Excel like application built with PySide2 and integrated with mitmproxy to receive forwarded traffic from Charles Proxy. I built it to help my coworkers with data verification for big data analysis for some large media apps. Essentially parses out specific traffic then validates it against prebuilt specifications and displays that to the user.

Thumbs up! You are doing a great job mate
How does the remote objects communication work?
Have you checked out PyCharm as an IDE? There's a setup for accessibility and cooperation with screen readers. I can't personally attest to how well it does or doesn't work, but that would probably be my first route. https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/accessibility.html
Idle really shouldn't be recommended for anyone. Even core developers have said it is unmaintained and has serious issues. &amp;#x200B; I have no experience with screen readers. But, I would guess the most supported would likely be the most popular editors with professional backing, Visual Studio Code and PyCharm. Visual Studio Code has a lot of extensions for various things, there might be something for screen reader support. Most editors have the option to display a character for white space, though I don't know if the screen reader will read them. &amp;#x200B; Another suggestion would be to use a linter, such as pylint or flake8, which will tell you where you have various errors, including white space that doesn't make sense to the lexer. It might not always know what level of indent you need, but at least it will tell you when it is something that won't run.
I was thinking there must be a way to run the code directly from Windows, as command line is known for not being accessible to blind people. How would I convert my code in to executables?
Does anyone know why the author uses “_get_x”? I have never seen this before
Python code can be wrapped in an executable, but that probably isn't what you want for this. What would probably be better is to create a Windows `.cmd` file or a single line Powershell script just does `python3 my_script.py` and perhaps `pause` after. Most IDEs include the option to run the code within the IDE and include a debugger to help with troubleshooting.
How detailed do you want the answer to be? :-) &amp;#x200B; In the most basic sense: [Pyro](https://pyro4.readthedocs.io/) intercepts regular method calls, serializes them to a message packet which is sent across the network to the remote site. The daemon on the server deserializes the message, finds the appropriate Python class or object and invokes the method. In turn, it intercepts any return values, serializes them and sends them back to the caller where the are presented to your application code as if nothing special happened. Exceptions are handled in the same way. Pyro also provides a naming registry to connect clients to servers and has a lot of other features to make your life as an application developer easier, and the network communication as transparent as possible. Let me know if you want to know more!
I don’t really. I make what I need or I make what other people need, even if they don’t know what it should be like.
I'm using Visual Studio, seems like the better option due to the extensive documentation and it's made by Microsoft. I really hope this works. All I need is to know how much white space I need, and I should be developing applications just fine. Any advice on conversion to executable files once fully coded?
What I really want to do is to make a application that reads the chat as I stream so that I do not have to use another program to do it. I just want to press a button and have it read the chats as they come in.

If you need to distribute a binary there is py2exe and pyinstaller. I've used the latter, it's not too bad. It really depends on the environment though, if you need to distribute to Windows users who can't install Python, or whom you want to make getting the source code somewhat more difficult (but still very possible), these are good options. If your code will run on a server, or users are more technical, you probably want to run from the source directly.
Any recent Huawei is going to be USB C
I'd rather run the code for myself, but have the option of releasing to the public later if I can. The public isn't necessarily going to have Python on there machines, so I eventually just want it to run straight from Windows as a program that'd be launched from the start menu.
This may help though it's written in Java https://github.com/RipMeApp/ripme/blob/master/src/main/java/com/rarchives/ripme/ripper/rippers/InstagramRipper.java
&gt;solving captcha Good luck.
Getting into the Start menu and such is in the realm of installers, but the two tools I mentioned above are a step in that direction. Until you are to the point of considering distribution though there isn't a need to make an executable. The single line Powershell or Cmd script can be double clicked, or added to your Start menu, easily.
That's likely well within the realm of possibility. You might need some Windows APIs to get the text. I don't have anything to point you to on that one, unfortunately.
The whole point of captcha is that it requires human interaction to prevent bots and reduce spam. Likely noone will want to try to help you with this.
I will follow your advice. Is there anything I should know about Python? The manuals make it seem as though you need all this stuff to do different functions, is it required to get all of these dependencies to get even the simple things done, or can I just write the code manually?
Why not use smart_open? It seems like a better option here.
It depends on what problem you are solving. The standard library is huge and has more than anyone could ever use. For some things third party libraries are better, such as the requests library. As far as writing code goes, if I understood your question correctly, you don't necessarily need anything other than any plain text editor, such as Notepad, and a Python interpreter. One of the beauties of Python is that you can get started quickly and solve problems early on in the journey.
Seems like an odd place to post why not try your local subreddit?
Visual Studio is an Ide, and I'm currently in the process of installing the stuff needed to work Python on it, as well as some programming languages. I just hope that this will be the definitive software for Python.
Sure, but you probably don’t store them all in a flat dict, do you?
Ruby might be worth checking out. It's a very easy language to learn and very similar to python but way less stringent about how the code is formatted. Python is one of the few languages that is so particular about white space so it might just be a hard language for you to learn or utilize. Ruby allows you to essentially format the code any way you want and uses def end keywords to denote code blocks instead of whitespace like python.

Why the hell is this on r/Python ???
As others have mentioned, some aspects of python like generators have really helped the memory issues with python, which really is its primary limitation. It’s simply unavoidable with dynamic memory allocation. While it does require much more effort, the real answer to this problem is to move away from a pure python implementation. I always advise python users looking for faster programs or better memory management to learn C. Since python is implemented in C, interfacing between the two is relatively easy and there’s even a standard library package for it (“ctypes”). For larger projects, Cython is a better approach. Learning C and how to connect it to python may not be feasible within the time frame a lot of people have for the projects they’re working on, but as a long term goal it is an unbelievably useful and rewarding programming skill.

^^This is great advice. I’m not 100% certain, but I imagine python’s white space requirement would be VERY hard to grasp with blindness. Nothing wrong with picking Ruby here instead.
No clue why he is being extra verbose there, maybe he is worried people don't understand what `@property` does or something. But yeah, to be consistent with the others would just be `def x(self):` and so on

If you ever try the IPython REPL or Jupyter (a web-based REPL-based interface), and have accessibility suggestions/issues in programs or documentation; feel free to send as PM if you do not want to open suggestion on github for example. For the indentation issue; I'm not quite sure if you have issues only with reading and/or typing, but it should be possible to write an extension in many case that would start the line with the level of indentation as a number, something that would feel like: ``` 0 def fib(n): 1 "Fibonacci function" 1 if n &lt; 2: 2 return 1 1 else: 2 return fib(n-1)+fib(n-2) ``` I'm guessing this should be easier to get in brail or via a screen reader, and writing a script to convert back and forth between formats should be possible. If you are following on https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/ a javascript snippet could try to go through all the `pre` tag and reformat them in above format. My JS is rusty, but something along: ``` /// does not deal with &gt;&gt;&gt; and ... issues. element.innerHTML.split('\n').map( function(x){ var n=x.search(/\S/); return n+' '+x.slice(n) } ).join('\n') ``` Python also support [import hooks](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#import-hooks), which would allow you to import files with your own custom syntax. It's not super easy to write, but if having extra makers for you when you write is useful; we can try to "teach" python how to read those special files with these extra markers.
I’ve taken on Python by going for project to project. This week I really wanted to work on classes and constructors and all that.

Once you activate an environment, you I believe there are environment variables that hold it's name. You could create a script that runs after the environment is activate that redefines the PS1 variable however you want. Any `*.sh` file in `${CONDA_PREFIX}/etc/conda/activate.d/` is sourced after environment activation. [Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34606196/create-a-post-activate-script-in-conda) However, this could get annoying with multiple environments. Conda packages can also put scripts in that same `activate.d` directory (not sure how to set this up), so in theory, you could create a conda package like 'set-my-ps1' and then add it to every environment you make :P

You could keep that dataset on disk as a csv file and then use a generator to pull in the data one row at a time. If you need all the data at once you should use a database like postgres.

If you really need speed, and have large computational resources available, then mpi4py-fft would be my go-to solution. It is used on very large research clusters, but probably works fine on a decent stand-alone computer as well. It is also actively developed and used for large physics simulations. I have not used it myself, but I know some users and developers. They are able to compete with (and outcompete) some pretty optimised compiled language tools due to new work-splitting algorithms
But, if your problems are small, and you just want to solve many of them, I would read up on thread and/or process pools in Python. Parallel maps or something like that should combine well with numpy's fft
A list of supported sites in the readme would be nice.

Interesting! I wonder what causes this.
My guess is that the main problem you will face is that Python uses whitespace for block delimitation, which unfortunately is a purely visual cue and ignored by most readers. If you use a screen reader that allows you to configure spaces or tabs with a sound cue, you will be golden.
Yeah, better use bat or autoit for this.

I have been using "🏠" as my ssid for a while now, most devices don't have a problem connecting, but some things I've had a problem with are: - Kindle (does not display emoji at all, and connecting blind with the password wasn't possible for me) - Printer (need to connect with a keypad and a black and white classic printer screen, can't display emoji at all) I have an IoT network and just add the Kindle to that and allow it access to the internet. A second SSID that isn't an emoji was necessary for me as a backup option.
yeah i created a bat file. but i can only open the browser not the url in tabs. If that can be done... Let me know. Cos that will be of great help.

Yea that's what I'm experiencing, mostly scientific stuff that cannot be solved with numpy/scipy.
Yep
Easiest way I can remember now is to set those as your starting pages on browser settings
If you're building a DB-backed site or API, Django will be easier in the long run. If you don't need a DB, Flask is by far easier.
Yes, I had this idea . And was already moved to todo. BTW, thanks! ☺
Wow! Thanks for sharing. Very useful! What about GitLab, Bitbucket and Gravatar?
yeah no problems occurred for me except a printer HP (cannot connect) even the WiiU works hehe my ssid is multiple emojis I like
Did you try testing that? That is not what I get from my python3 interpreter (macOS 10.14, python 3.7.3) ``` &gt;&gt;&gt; a = 1000 &gt;&gt;&gt; b = 1000 &gt;&gt;&gt; a is b False &gt;&gt;&gt; x, y = 1000, 1000 &gt;&gt;&gt; x is y False ```
It's bad enough that I wouldn't recommend using it. Your phone and computer should work fine but stuff like printers, eBook readers and internet radios won't work
In tomorrows news: Apple releases a hotfix for iOS devices that crash and get stuck in a reboot loop when in range of a Wi-Fi with a name containing emojis.
\&gt;&gt; a = 256 \&gt;&gt; b = 256 \&gt;&gt; a is b True &amp;#x200B; \&gt;&gt; a = 257 \&gt;&gt; b = 257 \&gt;&gt; a is b False &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Meditate on this and you'll find the answer to your question.
You're looking for something called keyboard hooks https://pypi.org/project/keyboard/
Django takes some getting used to. It might be too much for a very small project. If you want to check out django i can recommend taking a look at sentdex his tutorial
Some(many) of them don't rely on responses . They have a special page showing error messages &amp; saying account doesn't exist. And so they give 200 response for non-existing accounts. If we implement this on that sites then users will get wrong information. So I have already planned for using error messages as a source. And this is already in the todo section.
thank you
Oh, nice REST implementation they sor! 200 code for an error... -.-" Yes, of course there's nothing you can do except to checkout the response body for a valid or invalid actual answer. Anyway, sorry for pointing that out, I didn't checkout the TODO section..
Ill give one more tip: Input: a = 2 b = a b = b - 2 print(a) //0 a = 2 b = 2 b = b - 2 print(a) // 2 Output: 0 2
I didn't knew about sherlock before you posted this. I had some problems. To solve them I thought to build search4. And yes, sorry I didn't googled this before. And , the working of Search4 &amp; Sherlock is very different? Although the idea is same ~_~ Anyway , I made search4 . And now it's just there.

So they just fill the file input with file path?
This should only work with lists where you're not actually creating a new list but creating a second pointer to it. When creating multiple `int`s I'm fairly sure they're two unique objects and the `==` operator should be used instead.
Mariavi has been working on Banhammer for a really long time now and we recently released a working version of [Banhammer.py](https://www.github.com/Dan6erbond/Banhammer.py) that won 2nd place in Discord's Hack Week competition. :)
Building an API? Check out FastAPI https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/
The solution, at least for me, was to have a second, non-emoji network that is set to not broadcast SSID, specifically for IoT things (most routers support at least two, one across 2.4GHz and one at 5GHz).
To get a specific bit from an int value you can simply do: def bitget(number, pos): return (number &gt;&gt; pos) &amp; 1 The 0 position would be the rightmost (smallest in value) bit of the binary representation of the number.
It works in Python 2, but not 3.
This has nothing to do with the small-integer cache.
Thank you. I hope Python can give me a warning when i'm overwritting built-ins. - i usu. try to avoid this by using alternate spellings like i did above: Keywrds , s, st, and Str (with uppercase S)
Wow that is awesome. Very clean and simple interface. Congrats!
The second one works in Python 2.
Yep that's exactly what I do, it's worked out well so far.
What people? What exactly do they say? "Why do some people say pineapple on pizza is a joke?"
Object oriented programming is not a joke. It's actually for the better as it's less messy and less error prone. I'm pretty sure they're either trolling or theyre being the real joke in the tech world

I wasn't really satisfied with what was on offer recently as well (soundcard, sounddevice, pyaudio, ...) until I discovered the multiplatform 'miniaudio' C-library. It offers some very nice properties: * multiplatform, supports many Audio drivers * playback and recording * includes decoders for mp3, vorbis, flac and wav * sample format conversion (channels, samplerate, bits) * efficient asynchronous API * is free, rather small and was easy to compile My recently released [miniaudio](https://pypi.org/project/miniaudio/) Python library makes those features available to Python (and Pypy as well because it interfaces via cffi). I am very happy with the results and made a few tools myself that are using this very satisfactory (a tracker .mod player and a software fm-synthesizer) I'm a bit biased because I made it.... but maybe you want to try it out as well
Your browser should allow passing URL as a parameter. Check documentation.
Thank you for the response! I will try it out and see if I can get it to work.
Look, I already decided you were an asshole a few posts ago. You don't need to keep convincing me. I'm convinced!

Not _one_ framework, to my knowledge, but certain common packages are used for each of the steps depending on the structure and type of data. E.g., a typical process for me is to: - Extract JSON data from a Web API with `requests` or locally with standard file streaming. - Transform it with `simplejson` and sometimes `textblob` or `pandas` for doing text and maths stuff. - Warehouse the raw data into MongoDB with `pymongo` and/or Neo4j with `py2neo` and load the processed data into a useful form, e.g., a graph (`networkx` or `graph-tool`) or export to `csv` for sharing, Tableau, etc.
My shitty router doesn't even allow spaces in the name, how the hell am I going to get an emoji in there?!
Consider using OpenAPI with something like connexion. It wires up flask for you.
No its cool. Different implementation of same idea is good.

it shows true on me! (doing it on repl.it).
This might be better for r/learnpython, because yeah these are all pretty well know (except the @ operator, which just doesn’t come up much).
then why a = 256; b = 256 a is b \-&gt; True But: a = np.int32(256); b = np.int32(256) a is b \-&gt; False And: a = 257; b = 257; a is b \-&gt; False &amp;#x200B; there's definitely something happening with the number of bytes allocated to the number!
agreed. Is there a way to request the mods help?

My initial reaction reading the article was wtf objects are dictionaries under the hood anyway (i.e. `o.__dict__`)...? You're saying memory is saved because the key for each attribute is a reference to an object shared by every instance of it's class? I feel like this optimization would be easy to achieve with a few tweaks when initialising a dictionary?

This is a bit of an aside to your question, but whichever IDE you end up going for, it might be worth using tabs instead of spaces, purely based on the fact that each line is then made up of fewer characters so could make it easier hear differences in whitespace indentation

I think you should change the entire way you store and access data. Do you really need all that data in a dictionary? In ram? At once? Perhaps use redis or something.
Ha, thank you!
At its core, the script is just replaying a valid request captured by Chrome Dev Tools, and modifying it to contain the custom SSID. This works because the SSID is validated client-side. Try using the Network tab in Dev Tools to capture the request, then right click and "copy as fetch", then paste it into the JavaScript console and change the SSID accordingly.

I mean, it's awesome information. Just a really shitty way of promoting it...
The topic is memory usage. You need a pointer to a hash, the hash, a pointer to the key, the key, a pointer to the value and the value. For a single entry, the memory overhead is 6x. Add another layer of dictionaries in there and you’re at 11x. For large datasets, that means you need 11x more RAM than your data file size. That’s likely a bad design. There’s some bits of memory usage I missed, some intentionally, probably some unintentionally, but it’s close enough to do calcs with to find out if you need a new data structure.
You have nothing to apologize about man. You built something cool.
That's usually on purpose to help mitigate this sort of automated information gathering. Sure you can parse the response page but that's higher effort than relying on the http response, so they'll beat most bots that way.
Python strings are generally immutable? Not only is this using python 2.7, it’s not right...
I’ve had poor luck with numbs outside of pure python math heavy code. The thing is, for numba to matter, it has to be a large dataset, so it should be compared with numpy. I can’t make numba faster than well designed numpy. There’s a case for very hard to optimize numpy, but for one function, that’s probably not worth it. I’d personally would always pick C/Cython if you know how to make it compile. I have trouble with that.

Since you're asking if you should do image or video processing, you should probably learn the basics of digital image processing. [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) is a relevant and useful library for DIP, and here's a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhDlL-tLT2U&amp;list=PLuh62Q4Sv7BUf60vkjePfcOQc8sHxmnDX) that covers the introductory topics. A piece of advice when doing DIP: attempt to find the most effective way of capturing data (taking photos). If you can isolate what you're looking for, reducing the amount of variables already at the capture stage, you'll have an easier time processing the data.
Doh! Thank you.
Unless you're a Sith, there's no reason blanketly hate something.
Who said that I don't self-identify as a Sith? In fact, I'm so evil, that the scale overflows. The stuff after the overflow still says "evil" though.
I'd recommend taking this issue to r/learnpython and giving them more details - show them the exact error message you get when you try to install things.
Just to make sure i understand this correctly. You are saying setting up a flask/django app can act as a server to which an ajax request can be forwarded from my existing JavaScript website? And once the ajax request is made the python script will be run on flask/django app and return a file that my python code is executing. Thanks again for all the help!
Those are a bunch of things I havent heard of before but sounds impressive☺very nice!!
Assuming you're on Twitch: To start off: This isn't quite a beginner project. Interfacing with services, like Twitch, makes it much more difficult. One way to go about this is to create a bot account that sits in your chat and receives chat messages. Twitch has a developer GitHub repo with an example of a chat bot here: https://github.com/twitchdev/chat-samples/blob/master/python/chatbot.py You'll have to manage the account, OAuth tokens, buffering messages, etc. Then you would take the chat lines and feed it into some sort of text to speech library. I have no experience in this area but pyttsx3 looks to be an up-to-date solution, located here: https://github.com/nateshmbhat/pyttsx3 --- I just did a quick search and test, https://www.speechchat.com seems like a reasonable solution. You link your Twitch account and it will TTS everything for you. Is there a specific reason you wouldn't use a site like this?
... the verizon router salts/hashes the password on the frontend?
Wait, what? Your Router validates client-side?
Hmmm BoulderDash. Havent heard of that one. I'll have to check it out. Thanks for the contribution!
Very nice! I'll have to check that out!
That’s right . Your flask or Django app can receive a request from your JavaScript website and fire up whatever python process you need... depending on the time the process takes you can either send the response synchronously or if it takes longer , you can put it in a queue and process it there, your JavaScript website can then poll the queue to see if the process is ready , and if it is it can request the results from the flask app ( that is they way I have normally set it up )
You sure this working fine? Check again.
What does it do? I'm also doing some nltk. You should check out the spacy lib
It seems most do, yeah. My guess is it's easier to develop that way, and there's no real security threat.
Thank you! 😊
I'll try it out, nice job. However, why not use requirements.txt for dependencies? Also suggesting 777 as permissions isn't very good :-) just saying "run setup.sh" is better imho
It seems so. Is there any security risk involved?
Well changing the css attributes is a little more than filling the input
Long story short, Pythons integers are immutable objects, and Python tries to cache numbers. On the first case, you're creating two integer numbers with value 1000, and since it's not a small number (smaller than 256), Python creates two different instances of int, with value 1000. On the second case, Python sees that you're trying to instance two integers with value 1000, and optimizes for memory "recycling" the same int object for both variables. Also bear in mind that pythons variables are not spaces in memory, but rather tags that are attached to objects.
you might want to edit your reddit search call -- its using a username to search subreddits instead of users &amp;#x200B; so instead of reddit/r/ -- &gt; reddit/user/ &amp;#x200B; also there are tons of FP when I looked at error pages such as steam that don't have an associated id but still return an error page &amp;#x200B; Cool idea though!

Yes, I got to know this in r/programming :() And thanks! ^_^
Yes, there's a pr but that's just one. I am wondering if there are more issues so can update them all at once . As committing for each &amp; every update doesn't look so good, right? And thanks!
Congratulations on creating something! I like how it starts with "HEY" :-) Next up: making sure it doesn't repeat the same sentence twice? (minor issue, a spelling error in one of the sentences . "Im" -&gt; "I'm" )
The people blatantly made of straw.
If you're still wanting to use python for this instead of a bat script (nothing wrong with that even if there's better tools, you're doing this for yourself not for anyone else) I'd recommend you post this to /r/learnpython and include some more details of your issues/things you want suggestions for.
Well there should be many grammatical errors like (i instead of I). I made this gif before I refined those texts.
No, committing for each and every update is better. That way it's easier to see who committed what code, and when they committed, etc.
FYI if you need to preserve the order in a list that you want to deduplicate: no\_duplicates\_ordered = list(dict.fromkeys(&lt;list&gt;)) # Preserves order
It's somewhat insecure, makes it a lot easier to brute force passwords since you can see the salt + hash alg they are using.
The concept should work for most routers, as it seems they tend to validate client-side. I'm happy to accept PRs (or you can send me a router and I'll do it myself:)).

Building a pedagogical tool that automatically generates random Python code on its own; likely will accept chosen constructs as input (for loop, conditional statement, function definition, etc.) and using a sort of "lego block" approach to fit different elements of the Python language together quasi-randomly to form a meaningful, nontrivial, and functional Python code segment; to be used largely for educational purposes by instructors who wish to test students' understanding of Python code without having to manually generate code segments for their students to interpret &amp; guess the output; goal is to minimize input while maximizing meaningful output

Your example is different than the OP's image, though. All of the values are 1000 in the image, so there's no smallint cache vs. not. It's just that in the interactive environment, when you declare both ints on the same line, it "knows" the values are the same so it tags them the same. On separate lines, it can't know, so it creates a 2nd object. It's a similar issue, but it's not specifically that cache.

When I click "copy as fetch" on these lua-files I can also see the current SSID in the request. So I change that to a new name (ascii for starters) and send it in the console. It seems to work there but it does not actually change it at the device. If I reload the site the old name is still active. If I change the request to use emoji names the new appearing "wlan_settings.lua" will complain about invalid characters. It looks like it is validated on the device not client side. Is that method just not working for Fritzbox routers or am I doing something wrong?
That was poorly worded on my part. By “spot” I mean find them in software. IMO, No person or entity can stop someone from coding whatever ideas they want. And trying to restrict the sharing of that only limits sharing the general population, leaving knowledge to more dedicated users. People can either hide from it or learn from it ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
There are several good ones. What was your issue with them?
Having learned GUI programming with Swing in Java, that is pleasantly simple :)
Just some points. * U don’t need to put \ on the end of a line within a list expression. * the random module actually provides a method to get a random value from an array/iterable. * u can use differing speech mark types to include the speech mark symbol in the string. So ‘I\’m yours’ can be written “I’m yours”

Unfortunately I don't have any experience with that brand of routers, but if you're describing it correctly it sounds sort of hacky. It's sending lua scripts to be run by the router? Not safe. However, it could just be you're not sending the request correctly. It took me a few days of tinkering with the requests to make them work, so maybe look at the request and see if there's anything else that might help you figure out what you should be changing.
It depends on what they're doing, if they're doing it on both sides or just clientside. It could be a way to "harden" the user supplied password. The password "dragon" might be terrible, but if the frontend salts it and sha512s it, it is potentially stronger than whatever they initially passed. Then *I'd hope* they use bcrypt or pbkdf2 on the backend to hash it again... Otherwise if someone saw the entries in the DB somehow, they could login as anyone by submitting the hashes. One aspect of doing it in the backend is preventing that. But sha512 with a salt is pretty easy to crack compared to pbkdf2 or bcrypt anyway. Raw hash + salt isn't the preferred method anymore. There are good functions which apply many many rounds of hashes and make it take as long as you want to check. If it takes half a second per password attempt, then a password cracker is going to take forever to bruteforce. If it's a plain hash like md5 or Sha 1 through 3, plus a salt, then it's super quick per attempt.
Considering how insecure most router software is, I wouldn't bet on them using a KDF of any kind. Either way, if an attacker knows your salt and hash alg your attempt to harden the algorithm is moot. The attacker will iterate through a list of passwords using the salt/hash to generate the input to pass to the login api. It's so trivial (a couple of lines of code added to your crack script) that I wonder why they even bothered.

Nice! I did some work with tkinter, and just be forwarned, it turned out to be a nightmare to support. You might get more benefit from looking into more modern packages (which are actively being developed) that can be imported and used.
You sound upset over me fixing a typo I hope you find peace soon Have a good day
Never had an ethics class, but if you have an idea on how to stop someone from creating / distributing software, please, feel free to share with the world.

Inserted it.
Made the change. Thanks for suggestion.
Yes, we’ve been trying to stop people from creating viruses too. See how that worked out? We developed virus protection instead. Who gives a shit what they regret. It’s out there, in a massive, un-deletable amount of channels. I’m not defending these people. I’m just trying to say that we should work on a solution instead of shouting off rhetoric about what should and shouldn’t be coded.
Made that double quote change. Using choices instesd of randint.

Developing antivirus to stop viruses is good. Developing software used almost exclusively to blackmail people to stop people from developing similar software makes no sense. We can both work on a solution and also stop promoting this shit. Google "fallacy of relative privation"

Trying to build an RPG game and so far it is basically text-based-pokemon. I just added a second monster and it works great! So now I can add all the monsters I want and I have the fight system down. Now I just need to make "paths" between monsters, include loot, and I need to figure out how to add more abilities to the player, like... if they pick up a shield, they need a block ability.
Yes there is for me Haha. Emojis are for children. I will never use them in my code because I hate them
I'd also be interested is seeing the code, if you're willing to share. Which package did you use for authentication? Looks pretty sharp--good job.
Uh... what? &gt; Developing software used almost exclusively to blackmail people to stop people from developing similar software That’s not what I’m saying at all. Im saying people can scrape through that script to better develop anti ML-image filters to stop the product of something like this from being shared. What is it that I said do you think falls under that fallacy? Anti-virus keeps bad shit that people develop from affecting you, and helps you control it when it does. Anti-ML generated image filters and content control would help keep ML generated images from affecting you, or help exonerate someone that has been affected from the burden of proving it themselves.
&gt;That’s not what I’m saying at all. Im saying people can scrape through that script to better develop anti ML-image filters to stop the product of something like this from being shared. People wouldn't need to do that if this was never released in the first place. You're saying it should be released to combat a problem that it created. That's circular logic. &gt;Anti-ML generated image filters and content control would help keep ML generated images from affecting you, or help exonerate someone that has been affected from the burden of proving it themselves. You understand that we can't install those in someone's brain, right? Pictures are not purely digital objects.
I'd argue yes.
Not everyone uses all social medias. So getting all into action will be a nice idea? So those sites + some sites which shows error messages instead of giving proper response, aren't counted yet. But soon well be see todo.md
&gt; You're saying it should be released to combat a problem that it created. That's circular logic. No, very important distinction, I’m stating that the fact that it was released to the masses **one time** means that it should not be pushed under the rug after the fact. That is all I am trying to say, I’m not talking about ideals, I’m talking about the current situation. No you can’t, but you can help eliminate them from major social media, email, and file sharing platforms. I feel it’s better to attempt to help then to just hope that people don’t do malicious things.
Pretty cool, but you will inevitable end up searching for something more powerfull. Thats where PyQt comes in

Hi Everyone! New to python. I'm trying to pick up an open source language so I don't get pigeon holed (currently know SAS). This week I'm going to finish my submission on the Kaggle titanic dataset and write some code that uses functional programming to do something basic
The CPython small integer cache, as you've demonstrated, and as you can look up, doesn't cache any value larger than 256. OP is showing an example involving the value 1000. It *really* has nothing to do with the small-integer cache.
Dude I love this
that is a good one!
Hey, this looks like a cool project! It was a little hard to follow the flow of the project, but from what I read regarding the linux issue and the keyboard, you need to start the program as sudo. Windows gives programs access to the keyboard via the `keyboard` library by default. Linux however takes a more security focused approach and makes it so that you *have to be* a super user to give the `keyboard` library access to the keyboard. &amp;#x200B; Also, why do you use dropbox to store your code as opposed to GitHub/GitLab? It makes keeping track of different versions of your code super easy.

You literally just used "haha" in your comment. How is that different than using an emoji to add tone or express an emotion alongside the written message? And of course you're entitled to your opinion but people of all ages all around you are using emojis in their communication to make it more enjoyable, less prone to misunderstandings and overall more human. Besides, nobody recommended to use emojis in code, OP's project is about having them in the WiFi name. I'm not sure if you know this but a lot of people already choose funny names for their WiFi, so there's clearly potential demand for emojis as well.

This was written before 3.7 (released June 2018), but the difference between 3.6 and 3.7 are really minimal, especially if you are a beginner (same seems to go for 3.7 to 3.8). Looking at the [new features](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.7.html) I don't think I've actually used any of those other than testing out the new features (I work in a fairly modern Python environment, using 3.7 in most projects). As a beginner, you could read an article based on Python 3.4 (from March 2014) and you wouldn't miss much from newer versions (perhaps with the exception of f-strings from 3.6).

Structure is uniform, that there are two of them is really what is stumping me on how to interpret each one differently from the same page. Thanks for the libs, I'll read up tonight!
brag... let's see... One is not python, but it was fun. In the early days of Linux and USB there was a distro called yellowdog, it was made for macintosh G4 powerpc. I had a powerbook and I just bought an external hard drive that worked without any problem on mac. On linux unfortunately it didn't work. I dug a bit more into it, and I realised that the reason was that the usb-storage driver for yellowdog kernel had a bug, and was not recognising the driver as a USB storage device. It was relatively trivial to fix, a matter of skipping an if condition, but for some reason I don't recall, I didn't want or could not recompile the kernel. So, I modified the binary driver. First I found the if condition in the assembler dump. It was trivial to me because I had quite some experience with 6502 asm, and a little bit with x86 as well. The interesting thing I found is that the G4 had fixed length opcodes, something i've never seen before. Then, I patched the if condition using dd and proper offsets. The driver worked, of course. &amp;#x200B; For python, I think I had fun with two projects. One was a kind of packager/fat binary abstraction/path lookup extension called chestnut. [I still have it on my github](https://github.com/stefanoborini/chestnut). It was meant to abstract away platform dependencies on a bioinformatics project. Complicated to explain but yeah, it's there. The other project I had fun with was a modification of jupyterhub to support [containerised applications accessible via web with vnc on the browser](https://github.com/simphony/simphony-remote). You can see [a talk I gave at euroscipy here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK2ydXN8yv4). I liked it, because it used a lot of techs and I learned a lot.
I haven't actually read through the compiler code to see, so I couldn't say for certain. My guess is either something changed in how `co_consts` gets built, or else some kind of fallout from the int/long unification. My money is on a change to how `co_consts` is built, because it looks like it also used to work for floats in Python 2 and no longer does in 3.
Also, just in case you're still hung up on thinking this must be the small-integer cache, *this* also worked in Python 2 (but doesn't anymore in Python 3): &gt;&gt;&gt; x, y = 5.0, 5.0 &gt;&gt;&gt; x is y True
Sith FTW. *Peace is a lie, there is only passion.* *Through passion, I gain strength.* *Through strength, I gain power.* *Through power, I gain victory.* *Through victory, my chains are broken.* &amp;#x200B; It doesn't have to be hate. It's good to embrace all kinds of passion.
fair points, not sure i totally agree that emoji's and text messaging is 'more human'... I'm just an old get off my lawn type. I guess people can hack on whatever they want to hack on. I also reserve the right to tell them their emoji project is dumb. I will have you know my wifi name is the funniest and most hilarious of all wifi so you can enjoy that.

A Framework for python based on the ruby on rails workflow. PPS: The backend is based on SQLAlchemy. PPPS: i dont know if there is a PPPS but I just wanted to say that I am sometimes really surprised and exited how fluent this works now. I saw a similar tutorial which needed a lot of configuration and boilerplate and wanted to check how this works with PythonOnWheels. Since it is based on SQLAlchemy/Alembic in the backend this worked like a charm .. Sorry .. still liking it so much. &amp;#x200B; Have a very nice week. (coding or not)
Some ideas off the top of my head are: * Exploring "pythonic" OOP patterns and how it might differ from traditional OOP * Flow control best practices (approrpiate usage of `if...else` versus `try...except`) * Asynchronous programming * Multi-thread/Multi-process programming * Deque and other lesser known data structures * Walk through refactoring some Python code * Packaging and dependency management * testing and mocking APIs
Final point... sometimes it’s better to leave imports namespaces. Especially when u use them infrequently or it aids readability. It’s preferred to alias import namespaces to be more compact when used frequently. Take for example lb[“text”] = choice(exps) Now as it stands, simply reading this line doesn’t tell me how the value of text is chosen. In larger scripts, when I want to know I’ll have to navigate to the definition of ‘choice’ which if your lucky is an import and if your unlucky is a function somewhere in a 200 line script. If you instead did. import random as rnd lb[“text”] = rnd.choice(exps) 4 extra characters can make the entire line stand for itself. Now u can tell at a glance what it does and how. You don’t have to do this, but I like to when what I’m importing isn’t a method or class but instead a general functionality; such as OS or numpy.

So what you have looks like this: { "SearchResult" : { "total" : 4, "resources" : [ { "id" : "6a9c8cb0-e74e-11e8-a5e9-00fcbae86f2a", "name": ... } ] This is a nested structure. `ParseJSON['SearchResult']` is a dict (note the `{ ... }`) `ParseJSON['SearchResult']['resources']` is a list (note the `[ ... ]`) Each item in this list is a dict - each of these items has the `id` key So to loop over the list of results you should be able to do: for result in ParseJSON['SearchResult']['resources']: print(result['id'])

Your import is too specific. “random” isn’t defined since you imported “choice”. I’d agree with the opinion of just “import random”.
You have to call the function. calling the function with; password(name,password) Put it just after password1 = .... &amp;#x200B; Then put the function outside the if loop. Otherwise you'll use, password(name,password) after the function code. be careful with indenting
Woah, glad they changed that for Py3.
Cool, it'd be great if you published it on github I'd love to play it.
I wrote a hands on tutorial how to connect to an existing SQL Database and expose a JSON REST API in approx. 10 minutes using python and PythonOnWheels. I use the chinook sample DB (from [http://www.sqlitetutorial.net](http://www.sqlitetutorial.net) ) and SQLite for this tutorial. &amp;#x200B; [https://www.pythononwheels.org/article/9b9d61c0-5c70-48f8-8481-ab6ed10710f3](https://www.pythononwheels.org/article/9b9d61c0-5c70-48f8-8481-ab6ed10710f3) &amp;#x200B; PS: PythonOnWheels is my side project. A Framework for python based on the ruby on rails workflow. PPS: The backend is based on SQLAlchemy. PPPS: i dont know if there is a PPPS but I just wanted to say that I am sometimes really surprised and exited how fluent this works now. I saw a similar tutorial which needed a lot of configuration and boilerplate and wanted to check how this works with PythonOnWheels. Since it is based on SQLAlchemy/Alembic in the backend this worked like a charm .. Sorry .. still liking it so much. &amp;#x200B; Have a very nice week. (coding or not)
I'm working on a project library that does just that, I'll post it to github when I get the chance.

You put: `from random import randint, choice` But you also called: `random.choice()` &amp;#x200B; When you ONLY import a function from a module you call the function directly. Example: `from random import randint, choice` `print(choice(["a","b","c","d"]))` See here I call 'choice' not 'random.choice' because I imported choice directly.

The point is, use the API, it exists for a reason
okay so first off the main reason why ur not getting any output is because u created a function named "password" but never actually called that function i coded up a working example for you cleaning up some of ur code: &amp;#x200B; class Example: def password(name, password): users = { "Nadav" : "asd", "Elay" : "123456789", "Shimrit" : "123"} try: if users[name1] == password1: print("Username and password correct!") else: print("Incorrect username/password") except KeyError: print("No username exists") if __name__ == "__main__": choice = int(input("1. access\r\n2. delete account\r\n3. add account\r\n")) if choice == 1: name1 = str(input("What is your user name?\n")) password1 = str(input("What is your password?\n")) Example.password(name1, password1) so the first thing i did was creaded a dictionary named "users" with your usernames as the key of the dictionary and the password for the value. we then compare the values givin to what we have in our dictionary, if its correct it will say so and if not it will say its invalid. we also have a try except statement to catch a keyerror for the dictionary, so if someone inputs a username not in our script it will catch it and output that it doesnt exist.

Python is quite easy to learn, clean and straightforward syntax so you should not have any problems getting the basics. Your best bet will be Pandas. There is a learning curve but there are plenty of videos on YouTube that can get you started.

Im pretty new to a lot of this stuff so I don't have a github. I was thinking of making one once I figure out how to use git and then I can share it. I used requests for accessing the OAuth and Google Drive API's and http.client to send batch requests for renaming up to 100 files in 1 call. When using a requests to generate the google authentication page, I use flask to output it to the user. Then when the user authenticates, it sends back an acess_token that's valid for an hour. It would have probably been better to use Googles Python Libraries: google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib On my next project I'll probably try those instead.

That's really cool. What does it do exactly?
&gt;That's really cool. What does it do exactly? it's a POS system. you place an order for the customer and it shows up for the cooks. opens the cash drawer, prints out the receipt. you kno the stuff that happens behind the scenes at like any restaurant.

I guess its threading.

Amazing project and congrats !!! Now step away from doing POS work and never look back. It is a black-hole (just trust me) Restaurants are the worst customers for tech. They call them Pieces Of Shit for a reason ;-) Again I am not trying to belittle your work. You did an amazing job I just want you to take your talents to a better place.
Looks great. Are the menu items stored in a config file?
Looking good dude. Nice work.
HAHA I definitely know where you're coming from. There's a few dents in my refrigerator that proves it. Thank you for the encouragement &lt;3
Did you avoid the common pitfall of using floating point numbers to manage money?
of course not. everything is stored as integers until it needs to be read by a human.
yes and in google drive. i haven't implemented this yet (its just low priority) but I'll be able to edit the menu remotely.
is that Vim
&gt;of course not. everything is stored as integers until it needs to be read by a human. Oh, you should compare the average time to deliver a dish to the customer with and without the system. That would be an interesting comparison.
Then your code review cursory passes. :) You have no idea how many people make that mistake. Even experienced programmers who really should know better.
What kind of POS software do you think this man is writing?
I have no idea about what you are implying.
Using integers sounds like a great solution but is `decimal` not the data type that is mostly used?
he means "What kind of piece of shit software do you think this man is writing" gave me a good chuckle
&gt; I'd really like to know how to better deploy software, how to manage software across multiple devices and configuring environments for development vs production. I'm a devops, that's pretty much what we do. :) What's your current setup? Do you have a CI?
what is a CI?
&gt;Oh, you should compare the average time to deliver a dish to the customer with and without the system. That would be an interesting comparison. I definitely thought about doing that. But that time could be better used elsewhere lol
CI stands for Continuous Integration. It's the system that as soon as you push your code to your source control (you are using source control, right?) runs with it. Otherwise you need to run the tests yourself and deploy the code yourself and it's tedious and error prone.
Would you mind explaining this to me? I understand the difference between floats and integers, but when handling money wouldn't you need to represent decimals? Thanks
Floating point numbers are close to a particular number, not an exact one. A lot of times, that's fine. But if things like rounding error could cause doubt, as when dealing with money, it's better to use discreet absolute amounts. Instead of doing your operations on a partial number of dollars, do all of your math on an exact amount of pennies.
Boyfriend of the year! really cool stuff man!
Is the POS two different systems one for taking orders and one the kitchen? If so how do they communicate?
Does this set up have internet access? You have a good point though - OP should think about how updates are going to happen. Getting someone to hotspot their phone when required might be an option Source: the pain of being an embedded developer at the beginning of my career
really impressive for 2 year experienced. most professionals only work on bits of a product, now you just shipped a product, from start to finish. my general advice is writing tests, be critical about your code, and learn to write testable &amp; maintainable code.
Just a note, IDLE come with a few different color themes, this is just the default one.
That makes sense, thank you! So even a float represented to the hundredth place (say in this restaurant POS system) is enough to introduce rounding error?

well yes. If they were all .9 or .5 whatever the rounding is to, then they all round up one I would think. I thought decimal was always good enough, but I guess I need to learn more about handling money. :P
Let's open a python shell and try something: $ python Python 3.7.0 (default, Dec 2 2018, 20:10:15) [GCC 8.2.1 20180831] on linux Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. &gt;&gt;&gt; 0.1 + 0.2 0.30000000000000004 &gt;&gt;&gt; Wow, everybody knowns that 0.1 + 0.2 equals 0.3, right? Is Python broken? Turns out that no, every single programming language on the planet will get you the same results. Some will trick you into thinking they don't, for instance Python 2 would use a printing trick when it noticed a bunch of zeroes like that and just print 0.3 but under the cover it stored 0.30000000000000004 like everybody else. Now that we saw the weird behaviour in action, let's check out why. Let say I asked you to write `1 / 3` in decimal. You would write `0.33333333`. At some point you have to stop writing 3s and what you wrote is not exact. It *close* to the answer but it's not exact. Computers don't store their data in decimal, they store it in binary. In decimal after the dot you have 1/10th, 1/100th, 1/1000th, etc. In binary afer the dot you have 1/2th, 1/4th, 1/8th, etc. `0.5` in decimal is `0.1` in binary and `0.75` is `0.11`. Now, how do you write `0.1` and in binary? Turns out you can't, 1/10th doesn't work at all in powers of two. So as soon as you gave that to python you lost precision. Does it matter? It depends on your use. For instance if you are using on pi program that mesures the temperature in your aquarium it won't matter because the loss of precision is so small it's negligible, certainly smaller than your sensor's precision. However, it's a big deal in two cases: - The numbers must be precise. In the case of money for instance if two different computations lead to $1.99 and one is very slightly under and the other is very slightly over then they will be unequal while they shouldn't be. And it gives bugs that are incredibly hard to debug because most of the time computations will give you the same imprecision, except when they don't. - Numbers accumulate over time so the error compounds. There was this bug in a missile interceptor used in the first Gulf War. The cummulative error made it miss an Iraqi missile by 3 seconds and about 30 soldiers died from it. Now, what can you do about it? Well, if you are counting money, you can also count in cents. Then you would nave no decimal at all. You just put them back at display time. Or you do what you learn in school and keep the numerator and denominator around so again, you aren't asking the computer to keep floating point numbers around. Of course, it's slower than floating point because each computation is now actually several computations under the hood. Python already has this implemented in a module : https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/fractions.html
Ideally the CI should be able to access the Internet if only to be able to get the python packages on its own. I once built one with no Internet access for a paranoid company and it was a bitch because every tool expect Internet access so there's lot of ugly hacking to do if they don't. Though, connecting the pi to the Internet is another thing. It could be convenient for deployment but there's a security risk involved and maybe it's not possible. In that case there's no miracle solution, you'll have to download the package prepared for you on the net facing CI and deploy it by hand on the pi.
Thanks for the walk-thru!
Pythonic practices and when to throw them out the window. Also, I don't know if you've ever seen Fred Baptise's Udemy course on Python Deep Dive, but that dude also goes in detail and explains thing like why 0.1 is actually 0.10000000000000000000000005111... and how floats aren't infinite because binary isn't infinite. Maybe going that deep into the machine isn't your cup of tea, but you should definitely cover things like OOP practices/conventions, and multi threading &amp; multiprocessing. Generally, try to explain the whys, not the whats.
Great question. Basically the answer is, that if you know exactly how many decimal places you need, you are actually just using integers scaled by a multiple of ten. If you're not sure how many decimal places are necessary, go ahead and use an IEEE 754 floating point number. No matter what, it'll use either 32 or 64 bits to get as close as it can to your number. I'd recommend researching it a little more, as I think IEEE 754 numbers are I've of the more brilliant things in computer science. The most frustrating bit is that they had to special case zero (but don't take my word for it, go look up why!)
I knew this concept already, but I still loved reading this walkthrough and how you explained it! Thanks!
Thank you very much for the thorough answer, it makes complete sense now. And thank you for the [Gulf War](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~arnold//disasters/patriot.html) fact, it really illustrates the problem with compounding rounding errors.
Best explanation here. Good write up.
I’m making a very basic operating system for a ARM based computer that I made P.S. it’s not a raspberry pi... I made the computer myself
This is very cool! What were your motivations for making it? How expensive are off the shelf POS systems?
I will definitely read up on IEEE 754 numbers, thank you so much for the help. I really took floats for granted, but I see now that there's quite a bit more to them.

So did my computer science teachers... They insisted that IEEE 754 wasn't a real thing.
Ooh, so you can do fun things like drop a "happy birthday" button in there at the opportune moment.
I really appreciate the help, by the way. I was shocked when I booted up the terminal and checked 0.1 + 0.2 for myself. I feel like it's something I probably should have known by this point! I had just assumed rounding errors only popped up with more precise numbers, not because of using binary.
Keeping the numbers in binary means your CPU can compute them in a single operation. It's super fast, that's why it's the default. And the loss of precision is really tiny so for lots of use case, it doesn't matter at all. However, floats are dangerous because they clash with human intuition.
I worked in a large investment bank and honestly we just used floats for money. Floating point errors just aren't large enough to cause a real problem given that you're going to `round(x, 2)` at the end.
Thank you! I never knew about this before.
&gt; I worked in a large investment bank and honestly we just used floats for money. I also worked at a large investment bank. The welcome material had a section laughing at JP Morgan for losing 6 billions due to using Excel which of course only computes in floats. Sure, you can use floats to count money in a large investment bank but it's still irresponsible. &gt; Floating point errors just aren't large enough to cause a real problem given that you're going to round(x, 2) at the end. 0.30000000000000004 rounded to to decimal places is still 0.30000000000000004, you didn't change the properties of floating points by rounding.
Very cool. If I'm reading it correctly, the operator needs to confirm whose tab the bill is being added to? I wouldn't want to fumble-finger Gary's order onto Kevin's tab. I'd also make the scroll bars a little wider. You've got such nice big buttons everywhere else that it's odd those are such small targets. Maybe you even want to use pagination instead of scrolling?
Using integers makes most sense when you don't want precision smaller than a cent which usually is what you in a POS. When counting taxes and whatnot, you are supposed to discard anything smaller than one cent. Integers make that easy.

As an addendum to that, most languages/environments have an arbitrary precision number library available. The Python standard library has one called [`decimal`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html). That being said, storing the number of cents (or some fraction of a cent) as integers and doing all operations on that is probably faster, and is a well understood way to handle money in programs.
Dude nice, I was kind of in that same boat.. start a job doing one thing and before you know it you find you’ve gotten conned into building data pipelines. Being able to program as part of your job makes it so much easier to learn—
Potentially mildly controversial: you should do some work on how python fits into the larger software ecosystem. For me, a lot of "advanced" Python isn't Python. For example, I've written a Python script I'm pretty happy with. Now, how do I: \* Connect it to a DB, so my data persists in a more robust way than \`pickle\`? \* How can I wrap it in \`flask\` so I have a pretty front end for users? \* How do I dockerize my app? \* Can I re-write the number crunching part in numpy/cython/etc so it's faster? \* Etc.

In my previous work, we store money amount as 1/100 of cents. This is mainly to support interest calculation. Rounding to the nearest cent everyday introduces too much error than some of us liked, so we round to the nearest 1/100 of a cent.
thanks!
thanks for the answer....will google search, what actually is a debugger:)
Nice work man.
One of the chapters of that books explains what is it and how to use it, I think it was the 8 or 9
Having worked in a restaurant-ish environment, make sure you look into putting some anti stealing measures. There's a very common thing where you take the order, customer pays cash, you give back the change, prepare the food, then go back and delete the still "pending" order on the machine and pocket the money.
I assume with this much knowledge you know how to use Git? What I would suggest is setting up a a free GitLab account. To implement CI/CD (Automated deployments / updates to your software, development vs master branches), GitLab will teach you everything you need to know, and it's all free. If you really want to dive deep, I'd look into getting your Python application containerized (Docker), as this makes CI/CD extremely simple.
You just need to know the basics and then learn about how to use the pygame module. Planning out how you're going to code the game will help. If you want to make the flappy bird game, you'll need to make the poles and the floor move and decrease in their x values and just make the bird jump up and down. That's what i did anyways, I haven't finished it yet
Yes I read it, but I need the code behind the making of the Webbrowser module...How they created it to do the specific function..

TLDR: Use the decimal class when handling money &amp;#x200B; In Python, integers do not make the most sense, even for "lower" precision values. This is because dividing two integers will return a float e.g. &amp;#x200B; \&gt;&gt;&gt; a, b = int(10), int(2) \&gt;&gt;&gt; c = a / b \&gt;&gt;&gt; c 5.0 \&gt;&gt;&gt; type(c) &lt;class 'float'&gt; &amp;#x200B; Due to Python's typing, the floating point type will propagate through the remaining calculations. In other words, you may just as well be using floats to begin with.
Have you built in any resiliency? Like what happens if the power goes down? Will she still be able to run a report at the end of the night? How does it do payment processing? Was it hard to integrate with the printer drivers?
The UI looks like it could use some tweaks if it’s touch based. A lot of narrow buttons and small elements.
&gt; This is because dividing two integers will return a float No, that's up to you. `/` performs a floating point division and `//` performs an integer division.
Fixed it! added -1 to the \[-12:\]

Would OP really be doing all his development in his girlfriend's restaurant? Really I'm asking. Sounds like a sweet set up. Constant coffee and food Otherwise if he is, say, working from home. How does he emulate this setup and how does he push out updates? Especially if there is limited internet connectivity on site.

I suppose he would test on a second pi at home. If you can't test on a similar setup as production you don't know if it really works. &gt; Especially if there is limited internet connectivity on site. If there's no internet connectivity, there's not much you can do. You can't magic the updates to the onsite pi. However, maybe he could put the update on the home pi and his girlfriend would swap it with the restaurant pi when she goes to work.

Yes, but if you split $10 between 3 people and charge $3 (10 // 3) each [1], you've got other problems. On a stylistic (i.e. subjective) note, Decimal communicates to anyone else (or future you) to be careful with floating point operations, which // does not. [1] yes, I know you would do it in cents (or 1/100ths of cents), it's supposed to illustrate that you can still run into problems.

&gt; [1] yes, I know you would do it in cents (or 1/100ths of cents), it's supposed to illustrate that you can still run into problems. What *is* the problem? Where I live the base unit is not the penny, it's the nickel because the pennies were removed from circulation. So plain decimal computations won't work. Hopefully, you've encapsultated your money operations in one well tested place and don't have to wonder if you didn't forget to configure one of the Decimal objects to have the right precision and can adapt easily if your country ever drops the penny too. And who cares what the representation is under the abstraction? However, as long as you don't compute your money with floats, you're probably doing good enough.
You should be setting `low = mid + 1`, `high = mid - 1` instead of using the value in the list at that position.
Oh lawdy, don't know how I missed that. Thanks a lot man, I really appreciate it. Works great now.
A git client on terminal that automatize the git configuration on the folder and do all git operations, then i'll probably extend this project with a little gui for people who don't know bash commands or they are working on windows.
It's pretty cool. I see one big problem tho - it's support. And support after you guys will break up ...
Based on the vote count it seems I'm the one not using best practices., I've edited my comment slightly to reflect this. &gt;What *is* the problem? If you're splitting $10 between 3 people and charging $(10 // 3) each, you're only receiving $9, not $10. Which means you're losing money. I recognize that this becomes better when changing denomination (e.g. cents vs dollars, but it will still be a problem if you're making enough transactions. &gt;Hopefully, you've encapsultated your money operations in one well tested place You would hope so =) &gt;And who cares what the representation is under the abstraction? That depends on how good the abstraction is (OK that's me being obnoxious) . But realistically Python already provides a module for "fast correctly-rounded decimal floating point arithmetic." why not use what's already included in the standard library inside your abstraction. &gt;However, as long as you don't compute your money with floats, you're probably doing good enough. \+1.
I work at a major company with international presence... all the values are floats When they add up numbers and get errors it’s “rounding errors”
&gt; If you're splitting $10 between 3 people and charging $(10 // 3) each, you're only receiving $9, not $10. Which means you're losing money. I recognize that this becomes better when changing denomination (e.g. cents vs dollars, but it will still be a problem if you're making enough transactions. That's a strawman because no one will keep do math on whole dollars as ints given how much cents are needed everywhere. And bill spliting is a special case with special logic. Ten bucks split in three is 3 dollars, 33 cents and one third. Someone must pay the extra cent. Besides, bills are not always split equally. The simplest solution is to simply let the cashier enter whatever amounts for the split.
I wonder if having money literals would make people do the right thing.
&gt; Where I live the base unit is not the penny I bet you that's not true if you're doing a credit card transaction.
Its pretty impressive. Well done
That's correct.
Is your source code open? I’d be keen to have a read as I’m working on the same kind of reporting automation. Cheers
Just started coding last June and trying to create a calendar app for a client using the calendar module - don't know if that's the a legit way but trying anyway aha
This looks very impressive, and it's amazing you've got to the point of it working in production. Please consider making it FOSS on github so others can use and audit it, and set up unit tests, a CI pipeline, pylint and flake8 bugbear checks, type hinting with mypy and black formatting. Then you can package it for easy deployment for others etc. Overall I think you gain more by working with the community to make it a solid, open project rather than trying to sell it to a few other restaurants, in my opinion. Also consider adding support for inventory tracking, report generation for sales statistics and trends (maybe in a separate program, reading output files), and integration to receive orders via Ubereats etc. (they usually have APIs) - a former colleague of mine is working on that at a startup in Europe. Then there's also the prospect of internationalisation - supporting different currencies and tax rates, tax rate changes per product etc.
We use python 2.6 and java6 so it would be another 20 years before we implemented them anyway
You inspired me to make this [https://gitlab.com/stemid/sex](https://gitlab.com/stemid/sex)
https://www.ncr.com/silver/shop/ncr-silver-one-essentials They are usually sold on subscription basis. Here it seems cheaper because OP's girlfriend is paying her annual maintenance contract with sex which NCR doesn't accept as a currency yet. Also a smart move from OP to use vendor lock-in tactics on his own couple. 😄
It's just a thought experiment. If languages had a syntax like `$1.32` for money manipulations, would people use that instead of plain floats?

Threading and multiprocessing will be a big part of things with at least 5-6 short lessons on it in the first instance. I want to be heavily feedback focused so if you still feel there's anything missing after those, I'll be happy to revisit.
That's a good point and I'll definitely be covering those topics while steering clear of the more philosophical discussion of what is advanced and what isn't. My aim is to increase the learner's ability and employability ultimately. I'll probably make it parallel in terms of how to use python with docker etc. (i.e. release lessons on core language use and lessons on integrating python with other tools commonly used in development at the same time).
Ye if possible I try to use numpy anyways but some things are just not yet implemented in numpy/ scipy and are vectorizable so there I tried numba but without much success. Compiling Cython is not really that difficult btw, if you are on a unix machine at least (no clue about Windows). It's basically just compiling C using the [setup.py](https://setup.py) definitions.
Of course, I'll post the link here late next week when the first lessons come out.
Great ideas, the bulk of the lessons will be live coding. I'll only cover theory that I feel hasn't been done well elsewhere.

&gt;I suppose he would test on a second pi at home. If you can't test on a similar setup as production you don't know if it really works. yes. however, i only need the pi for hardware testing (like for the cash drawer and receipt printer). Otherwise I can develop pretty freely on my home PC and be reasonably assured that it'll work out the same way on site.
May i get a tutorial on tkinter or how you started learning to use tkinter?
it doesn't do credit card. In the earlier stages of development it was a huge goal. But on the advice of several restaurant owners, I decided against it. All our customers are willing to pay cash and that's a few percent that we don't have to give to someone else.
holy shit. yes. yes i can.

wow... that's cold assuming that we're gonna break up :(
&gt;Overall I think you gain more by working with the community to make it a solid, open project rather than trying to sell it to a few other restaurants, in my opinion. selling it to restaurants was never the intent. I made this for many reasons but it was not to have a commercial product.
I've worked with software that manages money for a decade now and I accidentally did this the other day when I was fixing a bug and not thinking about it. Thankfully it was caught in testing before it ever went out to customers but as soon as they showed me the bug I was like, "Goddamnit, I know what I did wrong"

Indeed it's for reading comprehension. To quote the PEP: &amp;#x200B; &gt;This PEP proposes to extend Python's syntax and number-from-string constructors so that underscores can be used as visual separators for digit grouping purposes in integral, floating-point and complex number literals.

What do you mean by input from the screen? This question is quite vague. &gt; I run the script and I would like it to read all of my folders names, or check if there is some sort of string at specific coordinates Read the folder names from the desktop? Read the folder name near your cursor? Read the string at your cursor? Can you please elaborate
It seems like you've got a bit of experience with coding in general but I'd still definitely recommend having a look at [Automate the boring stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) it's a beginner book but it has specific chapters on how to manipulate data in excel so that's very relevant to the task you're doing The only thing that isn't covered in automate the boring stuff that you would also need is "pulling the data from the server". Could you give a bit more information about how the data is stored? Is it in a database? Are they csv's in a remote filesystem?
I think that's fair. POS systems with improper security can be a goldmine for credit card thieves: sidestepping it by not processing cards on that system is a good choice, I would say. I know several local spots that will do all cash sales on the POS and then turn to a small Stripe device for cards and NFC payments. Better to leave card processing to those folks.
An integrated piece of shit system? I'm guessing there is another meaning for POS, but I don't know what it is.

&gt; Read the folder names from the desktop? Read the folder name near your cursor? Read the string at your cursor? Thats exactly what I'm thinking about. I would like to be able to apply this to any open program on the screen. Not sure if its possible tho...
depending on where you live, I recommend keeping track of which version was used at what point in time and so on. if there's ever an argument with the national IRS equivalent and they claim that your system is programmed to withhold a certain amount of transactions, it increases your chances.

Not really... To be as specific as I can be, I'm thinking of something like "*pyautogui.locateOnScreen( )*" but not to use with a picture. I would like to use it with any sequence of strings / chars and I want to know whether it is possible to achieve with any basic programming.

I'm still a little confused to be honest but I'm glad the problem wasn't the one I stated in my previous comment. &gt; pyautogui.locateOnScreen( ) Do you want to provide a string to a script and it goes and finds all instances of that string on the screen? &gt; How to get input from the screen? In this case what "input" are you wanting to get from the screen?

Yeah who the hell is ordering cold burgers? Serving wolves?
Awesome code! Maybe put it on Github? These screenshots and the public code would be a great addition for your resume, and something to show during an interview.
okay thanks
Sadly, no because IP but I need an excuse to pull together snippets for my own documentation so I’ll generize those and share.
Check out pytesseract and a suitable screenshotter tool.
Really interesting, never had to deal with currency or precision in python so never come across this Great explanation though, solution makes perfect sense. Thanks for taking the time to write it up
Yes. I'm also using PyGLM. https://pypi.org/project/glfw/ https://github.com/swistakm/pyimgui https://pypi.org/project/PyGLM/
Yeah you don’t want to get into pci. Are you using sqlite? How are you tracking sales month over month? Would be dope.

Here in Canada it's very common to have credit/debit cards processed by a separate terminal. POS systems that actually handle credit/debit directly are fairly rare. To give a little context, well over 50% of payments in Canada happen via a card of some sort, and Chip &amp; PIN and NFC are standard for how those cards are used. Swipe &amp; Sign is virtually non-existent, except as a fallback when the chip doesn't work, and Chip &amp; Sign was never a thing here. The payment processor provides a credit/debit terminal, all transactions get entered in the POS system and the actual credit card payment happens via the terminal with the merchant copy of the receipt ending up in the cash drawer. Some terminals, especially at restaurants, have integration with the POS system, so the server can punch an order number into it and it will pull the amount, and presumably report back to the POS system that it's been paid. A lot of these terminals are wireless (over a cellular network), so servers can bring them to your table, pizza delivery drivers can bring them to your door, food trucks have them, etc. Even the Apple Store has some kind of third-party payment terminal integrated with the iPod Touches that they use for their POS system - they flip it over so you can insert your card and do your thing. If you ever want to add credit cards, look at adding integration to a third-party payment terminal instead. You'll save yourself a lot of headaches when it comes to security and PCI compliance.

&gt;Yeah you don’t want to get into pci. Are you using sqlite? How are you tracking sales month over month? Would be dope. google sheets. simple and gets the job done.
that's exactly what I planned to do. It just wasn't necessary.
I was hoping to write some sort of bot that i could use in an app (any), without dedicated modules, like raw simulation of my actions on computer (most likely with pyautogui). For example i open Minecraft and i want it to read my coordinates and act accordingly. (In this case beside some programmed behaviours, it would also need to read whats happening on screen.) What i'm trying to achieve is to create some universal scheme that i could apply to any game (of course with specific algorithms dependent on my needs). I know there are plenty of modules created in order to interact with apps, but i would like to approach this problem differently. Thats why i'd like to know if there is some universal module that would allow me to read whats on the screen.
I've never worked food service, so I can't compare to any other restaurant POS system. But is it normal that the button to remove an item from an order displays the price of the item? It would've never occurred to me that I press that button to remove something. Might've guessed it lets me give discounts, maybe, by changing the price. Expected some kind of big red X for item removal though.
Beautiful explanation.

Is there any way you could share this code with all the other beginners here? Amazing work!
Meh
Python is one of the most popular languages in the world but it still doesn't have a GIL-less JIT, so you still need to do C modules fuckery to make it fast... Hope it changes soon.
Okay well in that case you could set up some sort of optical character recognition (OCR) system that looks at a certain area of the screen and transcribes the string it sees there. Sit this string check in a loop and on each loop do whatever programmed behaviours you want it to do. That would be easy to set up for one program (the minecraft example) but you'd need to find a way to let the script know to check in a different area for other programs (this is probably where coordinate checking with pyautogui would come in)
Ah, so *you're* the one that got this project working! Thank you so much for all of your help, you have no idea how many hours I spent trying to figure out what was going on!
Yup, thats probably the best solution, thanks.
Did you have to deal with any legal restrictions in your country, like proof that data cannot be easily altered or APIs for the tax office?

What about coding challenges? Off the top of my head, I know there's Hackerrank, Leetcode, and Project Euler. The last one focuses a lot on mathematical concepts, but I'm not sure about statistics.
private repo so i need your github account
Maybe for domesticated wolves? Aka dogs
I would be forever in your debt if you shared that project with me :) [https://github.com/LieberLois](https://github.com/LieberLois)
&gt;Please. I'd be glad to review your code thoroughly and mercilessly. u had me at mercilessly. need a github account since its a private repo
I am working on Silverback (A Status and Incident Communication Tool.) \~ [https://github.com/silverbackhq/silverback](https://github.com/silverbackhq/silverback)
why not tkinter? it comes prepackaged with python. no its not an OS. it runs on raspbian no one. that's why its no longer on the menu. what you see is the local file.
&gt;You're saying memory is saved because the key for each attribute is a reference to an object shared by every instance of it's class? &amp;#x200B; Basically yes, though it's a table pointing to a shared set of keys for all instance dicts, which means it an individual class modifies it's instance keys (say by adding to it), it can be forced to revert back to a "normal" dict for that instance. It mostly works out well for instances that assign to all their intended members in their \_\_init\_\_ method; so that \*first\* instance likely ends up with a non-shared dictionary, since it grows as the members variables are assigned, but the \*next\* instances can build the shared dictionary with the correct size and shared data. &amp;#x200B; &gt;I feel like this optimization would be easy to achieve with a few tweaks when initialising a dictionary? At the very least, it likely wouldn't come into play unless you explicitly made a dict.copy() so that there is a way of associating "shared" keys with each other, and even then it'll revert to a normal non-shared dict if the set of keys are manipulated to almost any extent (adding more keys being the main culprit, I think). So while it works well for instances, it may not work nearly as well in the general case.
It's pretty handy, can cause a bit of controversial, though. Digit grouping doesn't follow the same schema around the world -- it's language-dependent. For instance, large parts of China would write 123_4567_8901_234
&gt;I'd also make the scroll bars a little wider. You've got such nice big buttons everywhere else that it's odd those are such small targets. Maybe you even want to use pagination instead of scrolling? previous version used pagination. I'm hoping to remove the need for a scrollbar entirely. we don't serve every item on the menu so having every single menu item displayed is unnecessary. there will be an option to hide the buttons for selecting items. Well not really hide just not instanced.
Kevin Markham's videos are very good.
No thanks.
Some databases (postgresql, e.g.) have them. Though they recommend not using them apart from casting output values. I think they come with their own problems.
One question one advice. How long did it take to code it? Dont use too much colors or "hard" contrasts. It's completely okay to have red button (something like #dc1616) with white text on it. There are some tools around the net where you can mess around with colors and they give you feedback on readability. Just spend some time with them it's absolutely worth it. Also try to keep some color logic in buttons. Also feel free to write a blog post with stuggles/chalenges you have been thru. I guess you have something to say.
This operator doesn't compare values of this variables. It checks what both of them link to identity address of memory. Also if one of them link to another one.

In Python 2.4 they introduced a [Decimal()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html) class that provides a more generic class for handling cases like this where you need exact precision for calculations.
Not quite. $10 would be represented as `1000` in this PoS system so you would have `1000 // 3`. Yes, you still end up with a lost penny at the end.

&gt; why not tkinter Just not very programmer-friendly with abstractions that have come out since. Lots of manual setting up of GUI elements instead of components, etc. I don't have an answer to alternatives since I don't do any GUI work in Python
+1 Also, it's common now up here if a pinpad is tap-pay(not in US AFAIK) then it will most likely accept Android/Apple pay. ofc, this is vendor specific if they want this availability. Just commenting on tap pinpads are capable of these up and coming pay methods.
If you want a GIL-less jit you can go have fun writing Java instead &gt;\_&lt;
Very nice. Now I would focus on optimizing/improving the code to make it react faster and reach further high scores 😊
Yup. Most of my Apple Pay transactions happen at merchants that don't advertise it. I remember one even said "Oh, Apple Pay doesn't work" just as the pin pad said "Approved".
It doesn't have a JIT at all
This is badass!! I’m actually doing something very similar with node js right now. I would love to see: - how your using the raspberry pi. - how you are opening the register (I’m using an epson printer with an rj12 connection to the register that opens on print) - how you are formatting the print jobs. Any info is much appreciated!!!!
On Windows, services, versus a normal program, run in the background and are managed by Windows. If one stops responding or crashes, it'll restart the program. That's how I understand it. I may be wrong. I've never started a Python program as a service before but I'm guessing there must be a way. &amp;#x200B; You may have to make yourself into an EXE file first. And then install the EXE as a service. &amp;#x200B; This is going to take research on your part. Search for "Python windows service". Start hitting the documents. There are more than enough on the internet to answer this question.
Thats what I want to do, but idk how I should go about it.

replace `import random` with `from random import choice` then replace `video = channel_url.entries[random.randint(1,10)]` with `video = choice(channel_url.entries)` for slightly cleaner code--and you don't need to know how many entries there are, it will just choose one at random

Thanks.
i'm using my rpi as a computer? idk how else one would use it. as a paperweight maybe? if you're using an epson interface it's super easy. what you need is a mosfet/relay connected to a 12v dc power supply on VIN side, with VOUT connected to the solenoid (disassembly of cash drawer required). then connect the signal wires to gpio. you need to refer to printer datasheet for print job formatting. You usually just write some escaped control char before the actual text you wnat to print out. I used adafruit thermal printer and took their thermal printing library (in C++) ported it to C and built the python extension.
Hey yea I've been programming in Python for 17 years, and part of my job is code reviews, I'd be glad to help you out there. I've been trying to do some software archeology with an old bespoke POS system that my dad had made years ago in basic. I'd appreciate the opportunity to review your code.
github acct?
what?
Haha just curious how the pi fit in the system is all. I’m building mine as a progressive web app. Was thinking of using the Pi to control the register but eventually decided the printer is built to do this already. The register I’m using has an rj12 connection that is shared with the printer. The printer sends a signal to the register each time it prints to open. I’ll need to do some research on interacting with the printer more. Thanks a bunch!
yeesh, google sheets? no way is that performant, and aren't you reliant on an internet connection to be able to place orders? I'd strongly recommend you use something like rabbitmq or just a plain sqlite connection. As far as PCI is concerned, I have written many interfaces with different gateways, [Authorize.net](https://Authorize.net) being the standard (others are authorize compatible). A lot of payment gateways have their "virtual terminal" where with a keyboard wedge you insert data directly into their secure payment form, bypassing the need for any PCI audit.

Most Recently Used. So popular items are always at top / on default tab.
I think Intrinio is great for this kind of stuff. You should check them out. From what I can remember, they have both real-time and historical FX data... and I believe they send it directly into a live-updating Excel chart for you so that you don't have to worry about data mining and updating the chart. By the way, you're definitely right about there being so many outdated APIs out there... this is a big reason why I'm fond of Intrinio. Personally, I find that they are one of the few outliers of this unfortunate general truth. Good luck out there!
If I understand, you still give them the food. You just delete the pending order from the system so it doesnt count that money

(intentionally not using any stdlib) word = 'Hello' letter = 'l' m = \[c == letter for c in word\] gives you a list with each character being one element, each element has True if the letter is at this place. Then you can count the letters: len(list(filter(bool, m))) and you can merge this list with the previous list (somewhere in the loop prev = m): prev = [c or m[index] for index, c in enumerate(prev)] and then you could output something like: print(''.join([ c if prev[index] else '_' for index, c in enumerate(word) ]))
As trivial a feature as it is, this is fast becoming standard in many languages. Scala just recently added it too.
I'm aware of that but there aren't Decimal literals. I expect that a money literal would simply use Decimal under the cover.

Hey /r/Python! I just recently released this library for working with text that helps when you need to go back and forth between parts of an original string, and parts of a modified string. That may not sound like a very common use case, but it comes up all the time at my work (Natural Language Processing stuff for Microsoft Research). The [introduction](https://bistring.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Introduction.html) in the [documentation](https://bistring.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) provides a bit more background. To save you some clicks, the gist of it is that you can do some operations on a string, and bistring keeps track of how those changes map back to the original, unmodified string you started with. For example: &gt;&gt;&gt; from bistring import bistr &gt;&gt;&gt; s = bistr('The quick, brown 🦊') &gt;&gt;&gt; s = s.replace(',', '') &gt;&gt;&gt; s = s.replace('🦊', 'fox') &gt;&gt;&gt; s[16:19] bistr('🦊', 'fox') I've tried to make the codebase clean and modern, with things like type annotations and dataclasses. Take a look, and let me know what you think!

Some bitcoins appeared on mtgox because of using floating points on my account, now I receive the letters from gox trustee... Same with btc-e exchange (but they had it on display only, the backend (db) handled the math)
Its due to number being a floating type.. Check out python's floating point documentation for the same..
There’s also `decimal.Decimal`
Thank you!
Thanks for the help!
Thanks, Appreciate it!
Python does have a decimal module that fixes the floating point issues.
I'm sure there's a more eloquent solution, but this should work for you: def hangman(word=None, letter=None, progress=[]): if not progress: print('enter a word') word = input() print('enter a letter') letter = input() for char in word: progress.append('_') for x in range(len(word)): if word[x] == letter: progress[x] = letter print(' '.join(progress)) if '_' not in progress: print('you win') return else: print('enter a letter') letter = input() hangman(word, letter, progress)
Look good :)

Why could this cause controversy? Python understands the number you wrote there just fine. Also... shouldn't there be four digits in the rightmost block? My understanding is that numbers in China are organized into blocks of 10,000 (万, 亿, etc.).
what's the deal with \`from bistring import bistr\`? datetime does it too with \`from datetime import datetime\` &amp;#x200B; Why not just \`import bistring\`?
did you get a solution for this one
Does it have function to print receipts?
Question from a noob, I’ve seen this plenty before, but never understood...what is the difference between “import random” and “from random import choice”? Obviously I understand you’re only importing “choice” from “random”, but what/how does doing this benefit your code?

That’s awesome!
bistring is the module name, bistr is the class. They intentionally have different names so you can fully qualify things like `bistring.Alignment`, `bistring.Token` etc. unambiguously.
Well take each of the inside parts and run it so you can understand it... l=zip(* (a[i:] for i in range(long) )) Try these out and see what happens for each line when you run it in a python repl: long = 2 range(long) a = ["the", "quick", "brown", "fox"] [a[i:] for i in range(long)] zip(*[a[i:] for i in range(long)]) You have to actually go run that ^ in your python shell now. Don't just read it. And the only other thing you need to understand is the difference between `f(aList)` and `f(*aList)`. Here is an example for that (it just "explodes" the list so that each element in the list is an argument to the function): def f(first, second): print(first) print(second) f(*[1, 2]) Also see: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#unpacking-argument-lists
Different ways. One would be to start doing something specific such as Django. I work at IBM but on the side I develope websites using Django. There's also plenty of small projects you could pick up on one of the many freelance websites.

I thought POS in this case stood for "Piece of Sh*t". Thought to myself "what a weird way to describe your own code"

I've been making some slow progress on a simulator for arbitrary 2D potentials based partly on the method in these notes [http://physics.bu.edu/\~py502/lectures4/schrod.pdf](http://physics.bu.edu/~py502/lectures4/schrod.pdf) . Haven't nearly gotten it to the point of pushing working code yet, but hopefully soon!
PyGObject or PyQt5
I apologize for submitting a link that was already posted yesterday, but I would like to highlight a few things that were added since my last submission 5 months ago: * [ABCs](https://gto76.github.io/python-cheatsheet/#type) explained with two tables. * Table of different ways to format floats in [Format](https://gto76.github.io/python-cheatsheet/#format) section. * In-depth explanation of [Datetime](https://gto76.github.io/python-cheatsheet/#datetime) module. * Much extended [Class](https://gto76.github.io/python-cheatsheet/#class) section (property, dataclass, slots). * Section on [Iterable Duck Types](https://gto76.github.io/python-cheatsheet/#iterableducktypes). * [Metaprograming](https://gto76.github.io/python-cheatsheet/#metaprograming) section has a diagram that nicely shows relations among root classes 'object' and 'type'. Also I would like to thank everyone who helped in any way. It was because of this subreddit that the project became so popular. I think I'm finally happy with it and will be moving on to other pet projects. Ps: Only glaring hole that remains and I gave up on is a section about asyncio module. Maybe it will be added in the future.
&gt; second pi at home Or using free tier IaaS, or as OP mentioned another desktop. As far as arm goes, it’s not a huge deal for python, or as big of a deal than say go, rust, or C
The first way: import random chosen = random.choice(things) The second way: from random import choice chosen = choice(things) It simply comes down to how you want to use the import in your code, i.e. whether or not you want to specify the module name each time you use something from the module. That's a style choice - the second style looks cleaner, but if you use a lot of them in the same file it can be confusing trying to work out where everything came from.
They all cross compile. The real issue is that there is no official support for Go and Rust only offers Tier 2 support.
I wrote a lambda that starts/stops EC2 instances by the Name tag. It's my first real python script and I am super proud of it especially because I'm going to put in Lambda so staff can send an email to turn instances on or off.
C'mon, it wasn't meant that seriously after all😱😎
Best way? Download Requests lib, BeautifulSoup4 and wget. Give the request lib a link to a Google search (manually with get requests (static url) or post) Use BS4 to scrape the page for all links Use a for loop on a find_all and run a wget on their url. I'd suggest what u/ElevatedJS said about the filetypes:

Hi, I'm the creator of PyAutoGUI. First, tons of apologies for the outstanding PRs and the poor documentation. I'm in the middle of updating it. Are there any problems you had, or things you wish PyAutoGUI would do? Are there any things you found confusing about PyAutoGUI? Did it install easily? Did you find any bugs?
What tool are you using?
How new are you to python?
This project was really simple so I didn’t use too many functions, but I think that’s what makes it so good. In an hour I was able to create a bot fully capable of playing this game. So from the short time I had with it, I couldn’t tell you any problems. I’ll do some more testing and let you know if I have any problems.
RemindMe! 10 days
nice!! you must have put lots of effort in this

Because they do different things. `import bistring` imports the module bistring, so you’ll have to call `bistring.bistr` to use it. That’s sometimes desirable, sometimes not. Alternatively, you can import only specific functions that you want from a module, like this: `from bistring import bistr`, or this: `import bistring.bistr`. For simple use cases, this is less cumbersome. There’s also the wildcard import which imports all functions in a module, but that’s generally not advisable.
What's wrong with using floating points? You just make sure it's only two decimal places
Very nicely done
discord.py
Yeah. This is one of the places where segregation of duties comes in. They shouldn't allow one person to both take payment and delete the order.
Software vendor at work is to lazy to provide an update agent for their program. We have several clients outside the office so manual updates are a pita. I'm going to write a small rest api and an update fetcher so I don't have to deal with 55 machines anymore.
Probably the best thing to immediately improve speed is if you're using the locateOnScreen() function, try passing a *region* argument so that you only search part of the screen instead of the full screen. That was the main speed up I got when I was making my SushiGoRound bot. I'm working on a getPixel() function which is seven times faster than the current way of taking a screenshot and locating the pixel on the screenshot. I'm not sure if that's relevant for your bot though.
How much did you bill her?
I am using get pixel, I thought the region would be to slow, so I guess I was right lol.
I am using getPixel because I assumed the locateOnSceen would be too slow. Guess I was right lol.
This brings me to wonder why even include a floating point system at all?
Because it's much faster than the alternatives and the loss of precision is tiny so if you don't need exact numbers it's perfectly suitable.
100 they are likely throttling you. Web scraping is considered bad form and they probably put a good bit of money into identifying boys vs humans. It's not hard to do.
There’s some limitations for really specific things but it’s very unlikely to be hit with a project like this, not that it matters lol Also: support; what? Like paid support for the language?
generally u will wana use python3+ because python2.7 will no longer be maintaned come 2020. imo using the newest python version is always ur best bet especially for long term projects. and generally not massive amounts of stuff change outside of syntax usage and some modules being redesigned and re-named. in general converting an old python script to current day versions isnt very hard unless the modules used in the script are deprecated/no longer maintaned. cheers.
I would start with the newest version available to reduce the need for upgrades later on. Though "newest version" can vary - we use Scientific Linux at work, as it is a stable distro, but unfortunately the latest python version is 3.6.8.
Starting a project today? latest version of 3.x
At first I thought you meant piece of shit lol
Code that's written for 3.X should run unmodified on 3.X+1 unless you continue using a feature after it's been publicly marked as deprecated. Run your test suite each time a new version comes out to make sure that you see any new DeprecationWarnings before they become breaking changes, but the process of fixing that code will be a lot faster than a 2-to-3 port. Your choice of oldest supported version should depend on where you expect the code to run. If it's a web app that will always be running on a server you control, there's no reason not to use whatever 3.X is current when you first provision a server. If it's a package that you expect other people to download and install, you may want to support older versions that people are likely to have installed. I.e. check what version is in the repositories for Ubuntu LTS. For the "definitive guide to Python versions" that you were asking about, I'd recommend the ["What's New in Python"](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/index.html) page of the official documentation.
https://forge.rust-lang.org/platform-support.html They'll check that rust still build ont tier 2 platforms but there are no guarantees the tests will pass. They take patches if you want to fix stuff.

Oh yeah, you're calling Pillow's getpixel(), but first you have to call grab() which grabs a screenshot of the entire screen. I'm implementing something that makes OS-specific calls to grab just one pixel without the screenshot step. Looking at your code, I think it would help you out because it'd speed up the program. (PyAutoGUI is mostly meant for the context of just finding buttons in office-type apps, instead of real-time graphics.)

I'm just looking for inspiration, any library can be interesting :)
/r/learnpython `Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!` It's annoying in the case of `datetime`, yes, because that code was written in the days before style standards, and so the name of a module (which according to PEP8 should be in all lower case, as it is here) is the same as the name of a class in the module (which according to PEP8 should be in `CamelCase`). But the `datetime` class is not the only thing which lives in the `datetime` module: do `import datetime; print(dir(datetime))` to see.

If you need exact numbers, including for divisions, yes. If you can live with a very tiny lack of precision and don't need to compare numbers for equality, floats are fine.

Hey Al! First off, thank you for ATBS, which started my python carrier! It has been two years, I am a DS now and couldnt be happier about picking up python. I am currently helping another department to automate some of their administrative work using PyAutoGui. So far succesfully, its very userfriendly and simple to use which allowed me to pick it up in minutes and actually is quite fun as well. The only thing I couldnt do: take a screenshot of my second monitor because I needed to select green elements that always appeared elsewhere- I understand it runs on PIL(?) which doesnt enable that as well and upon googling, I couldnt find it anyways. Second thing, I had to incorporate time.sleep(x) after some of my clicks in order to wait for an app component to load. Maybe I misunderstood your interval parameter tho, I really just swifted through - but interval=2 didnt work and time.sleep(2) did. Haha but Im nitpicking here. I really enjoyed working with your library. Cheers
I can review it if you like, thought admittedly there is a lot i don't know about , been using python for 4 years and built 1 small sized private project. [https://github.com/Nxtv2](https://github.com/Nxtv2) forever gratefull :)

More of a question for /r/learnpython. That said though, the expression x &lt; y &lt; z is equivalent to (x &lt; y) and (y &lt; z). Fun fact: this works with all comparison operators, including `in` for some reason.
So you want all combinations of the teams?
I would gladly make it open source, but the code is very messy right now. I'll clean it up a bit and add some basic things like GUI for loading meshes, textures and editing shaders etc. then I'll share GitHub link.

Ya, the `interval` parameter is just how much of a delay you want in between clicks (for say, multiple clicking) or typing (the pause in between the characters). I need to make this more clear in the documentation.
would recommend PyQt5 for sure, by far the easiest to learn.
I am now going to use this every time I teach something to a friend. I will very soon have no friends. Thanks
what exactly are you trying to do? you mentioned web.config which suggests you're trying to integrate Python with IIS
Even the Brits could learn the syntax.
I try to use the highest version my tools support, which is usually a version or so behind but not too far. Sometimes our versions are set because we're waiting for a package to support for the latest 3.X on pip or the package manager for our favorite distro. But I also update when I can. Breaking changes to the language might mean your tools update their minimum version: they could possibly give you new features you need but you can't use them because you've locked yourself to a python version. Most of the time you can increment a minor version and still have your project function. Tools like [poetry.eustace.io](https://poetry.eustace.io) can be helpful for dependency resolution and tox is useful for testing against multiple versions to see if your stuff will break. I use [libraries.io](https://libraries.io) to monitor the software I use the most. The language might get better. Or at least it might try to keep up with trends. @raymondh seems to be posting about performance improvements every other day. There are some convenient things added with each version, for example 3.6 added f-strings which is less verbose than .format(), and 3.8 will add rust dbg style f-string debugging (which you can get early with pydbg). When async and await were added as reserved keywords in 3.7 I remember a few packages had to do a bit of refactoring which version locked them, design patterns have changed a bit. @dataclass was added in 3.7 too. 3.8 has some interesting changes regarding the GIL, pickle, etc. The PEPs are your definitive guide to language changes. This index is also maintained: [https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/)
Just started coding. Tried doing a boolean. Can someone tell me why this input doesn't print as expected when x = 15, y = 9, and z = 8? It seems to bypass the first statement. It accepts values in the variables as long as they aren't inputs. It's probably the dumbest reason for why this won't work x = input("Enter a number: ") y = input("Enter a number: ") z = input("Enter a third number: ") if (x &gt; y) and (x &gt; z): print("X is best") elif (y &gt; z) and (y &gt; x): print("This one is clearly better.") else: print("Try a different number")

Started maybe 3 months ago and I've been putting in around 10 hours per week? A little over half way in the Automate the Boring Stuff book but haven't been strictly following that.
To add to the other comment, using `from random import choice` let's you know the exactly why the package is imported as well---this can be useful if you find a similar function in some other package, then you can just modify the first line to be `from new_random_package import choice_ish_like_function as choice` and you don't have to modify the rest of your code

Can you or someone explain to me why? I do t have enough experience to understand the pitfall of using float.

Congrats on shipping :) From the title, I thought it would have been a good option for transliteration of non-ascii strings but it looks out of scope.

I’ve done an extensive amount of programming on Pythonista, including an entire website with Flask. It covers most of your needs. I’d be surprised if you can find anything better. It doesn’t come with a built-in ability to add modules, but I quite easily found a popular script on the forums for running a shell in Pythonista, enabling the use of Pip, so you should be able to install most modules. I’ve used numpy on it. I recently tried to install pandas and had some difficulty because it couldn’t install dateutil 2.5 for some reason, but good chance there’s a solution on the forums. You can have multiple tabs open so you can work on several files at once. The autocomplete works well and there’s a built-in linter.
Haha I can see why you'd think that. I could also forgive someone for thinking this had something to do with right-to-left text. bistr uses pyicu, a thin wrapper over ICU, to do the heavy lifting. It's MIT licensed and provides a wrapper for ICU's transliteration API. I do want to include transliteration as part of bistring but ICU doesn't provide enough detail to compute the sequence alignment, at least last time I checked.

https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#comparisons &gt;Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily, e.g., x &lt; y &lt;= z is equivalent to x &lt; y and y &lt;= z, except that y is evaluated only once (but in both cases z is not evaluated at all when x &lt; y is found to be false). &gt;Formally, if a, b, c, …, y, z are expressions and op1, op2, …, opN are comparison operators, then a op1 b op2 c ... y opN z is equivalent to a op1 b and b op2 c and ... y opN z, except that each expression is evaluated at most once. &gt;Note that a op1 b op2 c doesn’t imply any kind of comparison between a and c, so that, e.g., x &lt; y &gt; z is perfectly legal (though perhaps not pretty).
If you have some programming languages background (or are interested in learning a few small things about parsing), [pylint](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint) is a pretty welcoming to beginners, and you'll help everyone write better Python besides.

Yep! The \`get\_many()\` method, if given something falsey, will just yield forever. The original hotqueue had another method which could be used to decorate a function to turn it into a worker, but I haven't implemented it (yet): [https://github.com/richardhenry/hotqueue/blob/0364d62840c575099bff25d50bfc4312a50c0cff/hotqueue.py#L122-L152](https://github.com/richardhenry/hotqueue/blob/0364d62840c575099bff25d50bfc4312a50c0cff/hotqueue.py#L122-L152)

It is using getpixel because I thought locateOnScreen would be too slow. Here is the code if you want it. https://pastebin.com/bBAnNQWZ?
This week I implemented Passlib TOTP into my CherryPy application: https://invoice02.planetslav.ca Passlib documentation is awesome and made the process easy and satisfying :D
I love having the username Rolex Dab and thinking I'm not dumb while I make posts about getting nostalgic for drake
Oh okay. Thanks for the explanation!
And theres plenty of stupid people on the internet that might get roped into believing its real and they should join...
TIL about the [configparser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html) module
Thanks for the code! I don't have time to look at it right now, but I'll take a look later. I don't know if you care about optimization, but I wanted to point out that it might be faster to store the combination of colors in the square in a dictionary or list. So if the order is red, blue, green, yellow, you could put that into a dictionary and make the program remember which one it clicked last. This way you don't have to look for the color each time you need to click one, your program can just do it from the pattern. Anyway, just an idea I had because I know how slow image-recognition functions can be. I'm not sure if it would actually be faster.

It's a great module for sure. I only started using it a couple years ago.
It's kind of a weird API. I recommend [configobj](https://pypi.org/project/configobj/) over it, though configparser IS standard library so that's a benefit.
Cool little bots! I wanted to thank you for the source code; I'm interested in making some bots of my own and may use it as a reference. Thanks!
Not really?
ah ok thanks !
I was just messing with you by the way, not trying to be a dick. If you want help with a specific programming related issue I recommend REALLY doing your homework or people will heckle you (start by looking at the documentation of the libraries you are trying to use). And try stack exchange/stack overflow if you really get stuck. Chances are your question has already been answered. (:
yeah for this situation i was looking over stack exchange but appreciate it, thankyou :)
What have you tried? &amp;#x200B; There's a lot of useful-looking results on the first page of google results for "godot python".
I read your README, and at least you comment your code properly when drunk.
If there's no config in the working directory, it'll throw a NameError, since `found` won't ever be defined. This would be a good place to use the optional `else` clause in the `for` statement. for entry in directory: if entry == 'var.ini': print(entry) break else: print("No config found, creating config.") # etc. . .
yeah and there are plenty of stupider people who believe area 51 is real. ^((note: it's memes and jokes all the way down))

Thank you...!!! that's what I was looking for...
&gt;Thank you...!!! that's what I was looking for...
i love your books :) than you for all you do.
Oh man, just last night I was trying to "roll my own" system like this. I gave up after thinking through a couple of scenario. This looks pretty nice.
No, someone has declared that it should be possible and asked an open source project to do so.
Made with Python, very nice. https://github.com/gramps-project/gramps

That dude is for real... http://keyhut.com/forreal.htm
we need execuitable code
Sentdex, i love your youtube videos! Looking forward to try this and learn from the code. This post deserves so mucho more recognition. Good to see this project on reddit!
this is autistic as fuck, and your code is terrible
Yeah, black added a feature for underscoring all long numerical literals, and then removed it again. Kind of annoying; most of their counter-examples of why it's not a good idea were "what about all the people misusing numbers!?", like for phone numbers etc. If you don't need to do maths with it, and the important thing is the visible sequence of digits rather than the binary representation, then baby you've got a string (albeit one with only digit characters).
It's a single player game with no leaderboard. Even if I was cheating, only person I am cheating is myself. I am just practicing PyAutoGui and PIL.
I know that. It was a poor attempt at humor. I was top ranked player in Toribash before I got banned for cheating like this. You could program all the moves. It was awesome. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bt9Euw2tFnU
I'm the original poster on Github, I've confirmed it works in most scenarios with some pretty intensive testing. Is there a particular situation you think that approach would fail under?
need logic

Really nice! Have to dive a bit deeper into that code. Started a similar project a while back but didn't have time to work on it back then.
