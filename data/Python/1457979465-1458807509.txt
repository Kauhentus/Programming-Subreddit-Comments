Which is why we have offered to give tips through tip4commit (read my post again, you'll see). I totally understand your advice and I agree with you. People have other things to do than spending time for free on someone else's project. Marketing sucks and I did not want to look like I was doing some bullshit marketing. I hope I did not give you the impression we are a big corporate cause we are not, we are a team of 3. Our goal is to help software developers like you. Our pricing are at least 10 times cheaper than any other competitors because we want to help not to make a huge amount of profit. Yet we need to finance the cost of our servers and others services we are relying on. Our startup has created 3 jobs just like yours over the past 6 months. We are helping our community as much as we can by giving our time to teach coding to kids for example. Our idea behind asking the community was to let someone, maybe a student, get the chance to contribute to a challenging and rewarding project. We did not want to take advantage of anyone and we are sorry if our words were misinterpreted. 
Lately I've just been treating "For Humans" as meaning "in Python".
So it's a good article, but it's really only tangentially related to Python.
Thank you too ;-)
I use openpyxl. For a long time they were dragging their feet adding support for numpy types so there is a huge slow down in my script currently where I have to convert numpy types to native python types in order to output an excel spreadsheet. But other than that I think it works pretty well. I use features like cell colors and wrapping text in cells. It generates nice looking spreadsheets which fit our data analysis needs.
How large are your workbooks?
Very interesting! Why did you choose `float32` for the result type? I don't think it changes something to the timings in that case though.
Is that true?

I didn't install so maybe it's obvious when you run it, but what exactly is the difference between this and just using Chrome normally?
Sorry, that's a fairly old link, I think this is the updated course: https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-6?utm_source=OCW&amp;utm_medium=CHP&amp;utm_campaign=OCW
Thanks for the luck! I don't necessarily want someone to do it for me, but some heavy hints would speed me up!
How is this Python related?
Use [xlwings](http://xlwings.org/) and assuming you have 1 column of data in column A1, then do: Range('C1').value = Range('A1').vertical.value This will copy all data in column A1 and paste it into column C1. I actually did this using 3 columns of data of more than 90K of data and it took only 3 seconds. EDIT: Hmm found out that if just copying / pasting one column you will get an error for some reason. For one column, you have to use the options method: Range('E1').value = Range('A1').vertical.options(ndim=2).value If copying / pasting more than one column, then you don't have to use the options method. You may like my [cheat sheet](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/pybokeh/e71fe9710817a42acfd2) on Excel formatting using Python xlwings and win32com.
I misinterpreted the Numba ``f8`` type to mean float - and only after did I realise it meant double! I ran it again with double and I got around 409 usec, so not tons of difference.
not everything needs to be for the bloody raspberry pi. they are the arduino of sbcs (and that is an insult)
What are you trying to accomplish? If you have a specific project in mind, 2.7 may be the right one. For instance, I'm programming for the Facebook API and the libraries in Python 3 are not as capable as those in 2.7. I'm not interested in modifying the 3 libraries just to do what I can already do in 2.7. If you are starting fresh and have no reason to use 2.7, then you should move forward with 3.
I only gave it a cursory glance, but why does it say that"GitHub Pages requires Ruby 2.1.7 or higher"? Github Pages, AFAIK, is just a static website host -- however you generate that website should be pretty backend-agnostic. I recently built a website for a friend's band ([source](https://github.com/roddds/club-silencio), [live](http://club-silencio.com/)) that uses Flask and Frozen-Flask, which was a pleasure to use.
Or turn off Jekyll and use Sphinx if you want to do it pythonic way.
Would a sticky post at the top directing newcomers to some wisdom on this issue be welcome? It seems there are a fair number of this question each month. 
Maybe the sticky can have short explanation and then say "tl;dr if you're just learning, use py3 unless you happen to need one of the following libraries:"
Ahhh I see where you're coming from now. It looks like it was just a difference in workflows. 
Thanks for the info. Seems like a good guy to follow.
[Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) should make this ez pz.
Spawn parallel threads, workers, etc. for each URL in order to parallelize. Check out https://pypi.python.org/pypi/threadpool (although that's been picked up into multiprocessing).
You make a good point about the transaction, I noticed that too. But the idea is that *if* a malicious user got into your admin panel the damage to done is limited. Assuming you caught it in time. However, if someone cracked your creds, you're probably still fucked.
i did not realize you were helping kids learn how to code. thats great! i would be interested in teaching kids how to program as well, where do you do it? it is interesting to me that you didnt mention this in the op because this is actually something worth volunteering for. going back to your request for work: i understand, but i think you are overvaluing how much your business helps the community. just because you are a small team does not mean you are not a "company." servers do cost money, i agree. labor also costs money. i dont feel like you're trying to take advantage of anyone, but you need to understand that no one good is going to volunteer for their time for free so your company can afford to pay for servers. like it or not capitalism decides your business and you either need to get investors or find a better way to make money if you cant afford to hire someone to do this. edit: the biggest thing is how vague you've been with tip-4-commit. exactly how much are you willing to pay for a python client library?
Fo sho somebody gaining access to an admin panel is an issue not mitigated by having what is basically an application level write ahead log. All I can imagine is this: some malicious person gains direct database access under this app user and so all he can do is insert lots of data into the "to delete" table, but that is effectively the same as just deleting from the table directly. This adds nothing except for a false sense of security and extra code maintenance cost.
I agree completely. On the surface I like the idea (least privileged principle), but I think this could be implemented much better. 
Misleading title is misleading. You're still using Jekyll, just not running it yourself. Having to use the ruby package manager is enough of a turn-off for me, but maybe that's just me.
 breakdown_user_comments(username, thing_limit=100): user_agent = "Breakdown of users comments by subreddit" r = praw.Reddit(user_agent=user_agent) user = r.get_redditor(username) comments = user.get_comments(limit=thing_limit) Got this from https://github.com/imoran21/reddit_history/blob/master/history.py
I soon will use it. Thank you.
That is a beautiful function. I should use this as an argument to move to 3. :)

I didn't know about the `_site` directory. I always just generated the `index.html` to the root directory of the repo. You can use something like `ghp-import` to make this easier for you. The advantage is not having to use Jekyll at all, and you can use other static site generators thats better suited to your need.
You make some interesting points, elliot. In my particular case, I actually do need select+insert on every table because there are use cases where those privileges are needed. If it was otherwise, then yes, explicitly naming those tables is warranted. I can see how my example would communicate the wrong message there. As for the purging script being "not transactional", that's because I didn't know there was a use case for transactions in this instance. Now I know which is to say it's time for me to learn how transactions work in the context of SQLAlchemy. Thanks for that one. As for taking a "convoluted approach" rather than letting the application delete directly from the table? A lot of that comes from the importance of thinking the way a database admin would think. A good dba will want to keep a database as locked down as humanly possible unless there is a seriously compelling reason to do otherwise. Think of what they would prefer..... 1.) Grant delete privileges to the account that ultimately gets used by the public. 2.) Grant delete privileges only to accounts that are used by internal processes. My thinking is that most DBAs would prefer option 2. And if the DBA in question is you, then it's your responsibility to be that jerk administrator who is tight-fisted with permissions.
Nowhere near 80k rows. The most we have is like 250 rows and I think the max columns we can have is 108, on average though we have way less than that (I think maybe 30). Also, we use multiple worksheets. 
This is where I got stuck before. I download and saved get-pip.py to my desktop, and then when I type python get-pip.py into my python command prompt it gives me an invalid syntax error, even though I copied and pasted the exact line.
Is there a reason why .exe instead of .py? 
Is your command prompt giving the desktop as it's location? Does it show something like this: &gt; C:\Users\Mike\Desktop&gt;
Woo transactions - it's never too late to learn and SA helps keep them easy. Just keep in mind that mysql isn't always transactional and that depends on the storage engine in use. RDS instances default to innodb but the upstream builds still default to myisam (I'm like 99% sure of that, the last time I checked was a year ago though so that might finally be incorrect). If you're not in RDS then you'll need to check on this detail. I am a dba so I hope I think like one :) I 100% agree on providing users with a minimal set of privileges. If the app's db user has privilege to insert and/or delete on tables to/from which the app doesn't need to insert/delete, then that user has too many privileges. It could be that that user is being shared by multiple apps that each serve different needs and that should be split into different users. Or it could just be the initial shotgun setup that makes things easier (as you point out - grant all on all is alluring for making things work). Or a few other likely options. Let's say in your example you granted delete on resources to "public" and when a user issues a delete the app actually deletes the row. Now a malicious user gains access directly to the database as the "public" user and can entirely wipe out your resources table, which isn't fun. But now what if a malicious user gained direct access to the database as the "public" user and did an `insert into resource_deletions (resource_id) select id from resources`? From a security perspective that's identical to the first scenario - whether directly via delete statement or indirectly via an insert statement, this db user can still effectively delete resource rows. All that's changed is that things are slightly more complex here and there's an extra purging app to keep in mind (which incidentally makes more work for your friends over in ops!). This shouldn't really be a bad or scary thing, either. Sometimes an app does need to delete or update data, and access controls provide for allowing only those actions that are specifically necessary. It's good to actively keep these things in mind, especially in early development but do keep simplicity in mind! :)
no, it shows &gt;&gt;&gt;
Your comment is spot on! Waitaminute...
I simultaneously want to upvote you for your comments, and downvote the letting the guy off easy. I went with an upvote, because "never punish the samaritan", but you should at least put some bugs or easter eggs in it. ;-)
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*.

I think I see your points there on the insert scenario you posited. The "extra work for ops" angle is also a very good point. Thanks.
Thanks. Yes, that is more up to date. You have to "See more..." to see that you *don't* have to pay $300 :) It's Python 2.7 now, and not Py3 (again, regrettably).
Just get a cheap laptop and put ubuntu on it. It'll run just fine. Then he won't have to worry about this at all.
That's hilarious, down voted for suggesting to use the right tool for the job and giving an example of said tool.
Short answer, yes Long answer: yes, it will run on a chrome book. It's a Linux based OS
There are a couple of options. - [Crouton](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton) - puts Linux OS on your chromebook. - [Online IDE](http://www.chromebookhq.com/five-best-online-ides-making-the-switch-to-a-chromebook/) also [python fiddle](http://pythonfiddle.com/), etc.

There's no reason to act like this on /r/python. Your question was definitely better suited for /r/learnpython, so the users comment was appropriate. Please read sidebar rules for any subreddit you're thinking of posting in.
[crouton](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton) + chrome os allows you to run ubuntu which in turn can run python. I found it a great setup for about a year.
Github automatically rendering a jekyll site brings a lot of nice convenience sometimes. That's basically the big reason to use it. You can plop markdown files in the git repo and know they'll get rendered by themselves.
"Assembly. Language for computers."
I don't see where the title says "By not using Jekyll" ? Half of the tutorial is indeed about running Jekyll yourself. Jekyll is a dependency of the `github-pages` gem. Having to use the ruby package manager might be a turn off for you, but consider that having to use `pip` might be a turn off for any number of other developers as well, when you want to show them your stuff. I think the guy goes into way too much work wanting to install custom rubies with `rbenv`, he could've just used the OS provided ruby, or a more up-to-date PPA.
But if your perogative is "to know what you're rendering locally is what will be rendered by Github" you could use *any* static site renderer, and merely push its build results to the gh-pages branch instead.

most/all of those IDEs do not support python. along the same lines though, if he has a desktop running somewhere on the network he could run jupyter on it.
This is valid. Microsoft stuff plays with eachother so damn well. C# is probably a cleaner bet though and has some Pythonish features.
&gt; most/all of those IDEs do not support python. Did you check? I did. [Cloud9](https://community.c9.io/t/writing-a-python-app/1609), [Codeanywhere](http://docs.codeanywhere.com/preferences/supportedlanguagesandthemes.html), [sourceLair](https://www.sourcelair.com/guides/start/python#introduction) and of course [python fiddle](http://pythonfiddle.com/) support python.
Thank You :)
That is the difference between exception and error...
I don't recommend it. There are two Python shells available in the Chrome OS store, but neither are fully fledged Pythons and have possibly problematic limitations. Full Python *can* be installed, but only by using tricks which change the OS (e.g. Crouton), which I think would defeat the purpose of getting Chrome OS. The "gold standard" OS for Python is probably Linux, but full Python is available for Windows, so I recommend a Windows laptop for Python. (The Linux OS could be installed later, should he want to try that.) 
Nope. The purpose of getting a chromebook is being able to get a very cheap netbook to put Linux on. &gt; You can get a modest windows 10 laptop for less than a decent chromebook anyway. Decent &gt; modest ? Windows 10 is trash. &gt; non-trivial to install which means if definitely non-trivial to maintain. This too is a lie.
Ok I understand. We are based in Scotland and this where we are helping our local community. I did not want to mention that in the post because I did not feel this was appropriate. When "companies" are working for free for their local community, they usually use that as a marketing tool. We help kids, because we generally think this is right not to make ourselves look good. If you want to get involved yourself I am sure you could find a non-profit near your place that is running workshops. The one we are working with is called "code club". You can also rely on existing resources to let you start yourself. One that I really like is https://code.org/learn. It is full of exercises that are games and very simple and get more difficult overtime. The learning curve is great in my opinion for a 7-12 years old. You are giving a very good point about trying to get investors or make money our own way. This is something we have been working on for the past 10 months, but it is difficult. We were thinking of giving $300 for the python repo. The donation would then be distributed 10% at a time per commit. 
I deliberately did not state C# or VB.NET as they are already somewhat foreign to MS-Office. Office uses VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) as its native programming interface. Sure, the .NET languages play very well with Office, but still there is some overhead needed to get them to work.
Don't get why you are downvoted. Your solution is perfectly sound and the right way to go. Probably the reason for the downvotes is that the question has been asked in a Python sub and not in the general /r/learnprogramming sub.
I did not create it, but I find [himawaripy](https://github.com/boramalper/himawaripy) as pretty neat script I use. :)
I believe Libre Office has a macro language, but I don't know of any cheat sheets or documentation for it. Sorry.
Not sure why he's getting downvoted. I paid 115 for my chrome book, has well i3, 4gb ram, ssd, and put xubuntu on it for dev purposes. Battery life is like 9 hours too which is great. 
For anything to do with copying data, wrangling data it is better to use Pandas. Just read the excel, load into a dataframe and load back to excel after necessary wrangling. Openpyxl could be a very good companion tool, in case you need to perform any formatting (using iter_rows()) such as applying border, conditional formatting, wrapping text, applying font, color etc.
What are you actually trying to print? &gt;&gt;&gt; x = 1 &gt;&gt;&gt; print(5 == x &gt; 4) False &gt;&gt;&gt; print("5 == x &gt; 4") 5 == x &gt; 4
pelican does this too
I have a script that lists new trending repositories on GitHub and filters out ones already listed before. Frankly, it's *not* the neatest or coolest, and I can't say it's the most satisfying job, but it's automated and it surely saves me a lot of time.
What OS are you on? What have you tried already? Would [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2846947/get-screenshot-on-windows-with-python) help?
You already answered your question. list.append() returns None, so you can't use chaining in this case
Look around and just find the best deal on a laptop. I got a 17.3" Toshiba Satellite/8G RAM/750G hdd for 299.00 because i found it on clearance. Bought it specifically for web dev/programming and i love it. From what i've read on here and other subs, isn't the chromebook a little light in RAM and whatnot?
Nice. Which one did you get?
Thank you! Looks interesting.
Automatically grabbing security card data via Wordpress form plugin REST API and inserting it into security system software using an MSSQL bridge all run automatically every few minutes via Windows task scheduler. I love -- in a mad scientist sort of way -- the combination of technologies in that process. Almost seems absurd. And fuck Windows task scheduler. For whatever reason it has proven to be super unreliable at running tasks even with the proper task settings.
writing a script to automatically download porn videos from a certain /r/opendirectories post, would have taken me hours to individually copy paste/right click save as... hours I could have been doing something else
It does work, just not in all cases. In order for it to work, the called method needs to return an object that has the following method on it. `str` is a good example. x = "my name isn't Fred" x.replace("Fred", "Alec").replace("n't", "").capitalize() # My name is Alec 
In any language, method chaining only works if each method returns the result of that method. `append()` does not do that - you can check yourself. Imagine you're the interpreter. You see `lst.append(1)` and think "Right, so this means that `lst` now has a 1 in it, and that function has returned None. Then you see `None.append(1)`. Well, that doesn't make sense, does it? Whereas if you have a method of an immutable object, the methods will return a copy, so you can chain the methods. 
I wrote a script that parsed the file names of all the items in my media collection (movies, tv shows, music, etc) and then collect data on them from various web services. I used imdb, tvdb, and iTunes originally but I ended up going with trakt.tv for movies and tv shows. The script then called out to the subler cli to write the data it collected to the media file. Pretty neat little script, although I haven't been able to get it working with the latest version of the subler cli. Gotta get back to working on that thing. https://github.com/moogar0880/PyTagger
Strong endorsement for python.
Hi Jim, we need to talk.
Also why dropbox instead of a git/mercurial repo?
I don't think it's misleading, nor is it doing any harm. 
can you share the code m8!! 
windows, looking into what you suggested. will probably solve this by working with a service instead though
Python supports method chaining, but the objects and methods in question don't. You can easily write a class where all the destructive methods return the object itself, and with such a class, you can method-chain just fine; it just so happens that the `list.append()` method doesn't do that, so you can't chain it.
The only way I know of is through selenium. In fact, I use the selenium library with phantomjs as the web driver to keep the process headless. Why do you want to avoid setting up selenium? I was able to get it running -- on a Windows machine no less -- without a hitch.
On the page you linked only sourceLair had python listed, and it only had syntax highlighting. That's 20%, and just a text editor for that 20%; and that is where i got the most/all from. So, yes, i did check, and sorry i didn't look deeper.
See https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/help/code-style-python.html.
I created [Jtasks](https://github.com/pavdmyt/jtasks) to automate routines in Jekyll projects.
I use a website that allows me to get points (by watching videos and stuff) to get things like amazon vouchers, it has a refferal thing where you can get 10% ish of what your referees get. Initially I would PM the people I reffered to tell them how to use the website and give them tips and tricks on how to earn points quickly e.g. using iMacros or Selenium to automatically get points with no work (I also do this). However I now reffer over 100-300 people a day (due to a YouTube video I made) so PMing everyone would take ages so I made a script to auto PM people I reffer, I also made a sperareate one that looks at my replies and then if the message they send to me contains spesific strings it has automated replies. Now all I need to do is reply to some people that need help, I have earned more than enough to get a good gaming PC, monitor and stuff so in a few month after Uni I will build myself a PC and probably get a new laptop/chromebook.
request could handle the page loading fairly easy, and you could just parse the return code for success/fail. The idea is to load the urls into a list, then loop the list with a request object that opens each and returns the session code. 
How does the 32 threaded version work so well? Would this happen automatically when using numpy?
I almost didn't put the '.pdf' in the renamed file name, as technically that is what he asked. 
 import requests mylist = ['http://goolg.com','http://yahoo.com'] for i in mylist: try: r = requests.get(i) except ConnectionError: print('this one didn\'t connect' + i) The above is a quick example of what you can try, no guarantees as it doesn't really cover anything more then just opening the connection and letting you know which ones failed. You can add more code to look into the returned content and add in some recursion for any that return with a 502. Happy coding and I hope this sparks an idea for you. 
I work with spatial and map data. Our main program (ArcGIS) has an operation called a "Spatial Join" where you can join together two layers of information based on their spatial relationship. Say I have a layer of addresses and a layer of election precincts - I can join the precincts to the addresses, and end up with a new layer of addresses that have all the precinct information in their attributes. But it's a much clunkier process to bring this data into an existing field in an existing layer. Spatial Join to new output &gt; Join target field back to source layer &gt; copy values from joined field to destination field &gt; remove the joined field. It's a pain to do it manually. So I wrote a script that does all of that together, and cleans up after itself. I can even select 10 or 100 features that need to be fixed at once and populate them, instead of doing an entire feature layer. I've had this in operation for about two weeks, and it's saved me a bunch of time. When I presented this to my boss, he gave me a thumbs-up, and then handed me a big project that would need to do the above over 20 times for different fields, from various sources. Joy.
yes, the first argument needs to be supplied on the same line. thank you! 
be careful. my chromebook has coil whine and its super annoying. trudge through the reviews and see if that model has those problems.
You miscounted. It's actually line 8.
Downvoted for thinking that we could read your mind and diagnose a problem with your code without seeing the code.
I wrote a script using Selenium library and configured it with Windows task scheduler to run on Friday afternoon every week which automatically pre-fills my timesheet and presents the browser to me to just to review and click on submit button. I used to be forgetful about submitting my timesheet before. But now I have the cleanest record on timely submission.
Linear algebra, vector and matrix operations, and FFT's are all optimized and automatically threaded. The threading does add overhead so for small datasets or relatively simple computations you won't see much, if any benefit from the threading (may actually negatively impact computation times) but for sufficiently large datasets/complex computations then there will be a significant improvement based on an increasing number of cores. Worth noting that overhead also increases with the number of cores so there is a point of diminishing returns. 
Use Selenium and either PhantomJS or FireFox. An example using FireFox; from selenium import webdriver driver = webdriver.Firefox() driver.get('https://www.google.com/') driver.save_screenshot('./screen_shot.png') driver.quit()
Interesting to note. My company is/was paying for the MKL license from Continuum, I wonder if our version of numpy can use more threads. I'll have to ask.
Not the most exciting, but the most satisfying was writing middleware connectivity between IBM ClearCase and JIRA when I worked at my last job. It was to track Developer releases which were self-managed in ClearCase, and the implementations I managed in JIRA. So I wrote a middleware server that processed the tickets off the wire in ClearCase, and then added to my project in JIRA. I then had another script which auto-deployed the releases to my QA and UAT environments based off my JIRA tickets. There are enterprise level solutions out there that would do this for me, but we were all about rolling our own solutions at that place.
Isn't that just a map-function? Where is the difference? https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#map
Theoretically, couldn't you accomplish what the pywin32 library does with ctypes?
Yeah that's the point, removing the browser UI leaving just the Notebook UI. It would possibly be better just to hide the address bar in regular chrome browser - however as far as I could tell they deliberately prevent this for security reasons.

&gt; coil whine Didn't know there was a name for such a thing. Great tip. Major noise-o-phobe, me. Any wisdom on how to avoid in getting a used or new laptop? 
But 90% of the time you're going to render the locally to 'proof read' anyway. It would be nice if GitLab added a 'proof' page so you could review what you pushed before it went 'live' and your site should never be rendered directly to live. With Nikola you can run 'auto' and have a live preview and then just publish directly to gh_pages from the publish command. https://asmeurer.github.io/blog/posts/moving-to-github-pages-with-nikola/ https://getnikola.com/handbook.html
Noobish Python user, what is the difference between this and these python binaries compiled using MKL? http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy
I agree with this. Anaconda is a for profit company and it's just a matter of time before their investors make them hike prices.
Would you also feel strange developing python in a C/C++ IDE? or writing Python in a C editor? A few of those are quite popular ;/
import the humor module otherwise they won't understand :( 
Well there are 2. One was an executable that would enumerate users of windows services, find a properly elevated account, and replace the associated executable. Then my executable would make a backdoor admin account on boot up, and put the original executable back in place, then delete itself. The other was a strange derivation of RSA that I used for encrypting/decrypting files sent thru email. It was "neat" because I hacked it together thru trial and error in python.
:-D i feel strange with java. No really, it is that I suppose that developing python in a python ide could allow a better integration.
this sort of stuff is why I'm a programmer. Great idea!
I pulled all the traffic cams for my morning commute from a crappy website that made me view each cam individually. Now I have a site I can view that has all the cameras for my route and any variations I take. Not really fancy or difficult, but used by me everyday! 
Wow what a CTO lol
I can see how an IDE in your favorite language would be appealing. I have to say though, PyCharm is a nice IDE and I do find it very useful. Sublime Text with Anaconda can be used as an IDE and it uses Python for it's API's. Perhaps Sublime Text is your next favorite editor :D 
Thanks anyway. :)
Nice! TIL
Potentially. You'd have to benchmark it yourself to know for sure though. Again this only relates to automatic threading done via the MKL. If you are already threading your processing by hard coding it then the free MKL version included with Anaconda would likely result in a slowdown. Again, I'd recommend benchmarking it yourself. You can also install a free 30-day trial of the unrestricted and see how that performs on your cluster compared to the free MKL and nomkl versions. 
I'm a Co-op at a company so I have to fill out a excel sheet, and send an email to payroll, with my supervisor cced in order to get paid. I made a script that does that for me.
I've used Cloud9 online Python IDE on an Acer C720 Chromebook. Works fine.
dat username tho 
You can. Try enumerate: for n, v in enumerate([3, 1, 3, 1... This is a royal pain to type on a phone, but you get the idea, I hope :) you could make it even shorter, but it wouldn't necessarily be more readable in context. 
 from itertools import cycle sum(map(lambda x: x[0]*int(x[1]), zip(cycle((3, 1)), '1234567'))) from itertools import cycle a = cycle((3, 1)) sum(map(lambda d: int(d)*next(a), '1234567')) from itertools import cycle from operator import mul sum(map(lambda x: mul(*x), zip(cycle((3, 1)), map(int, '1234567')))) 
something like sum(map(lambda (x, y) : x*y, zip(YOUR_LIST, [3,1...]))) 
So the benchmarks appear to be for dense matrices. Does anyone know whether the sparse linear algebra wrappers in scipy (e.g. scipy.sparse.linalg.splu) are also optimised? I think these different sparse libraries (SuperLU and others) under the hood.
The reason I learned Python to begin with. I did 3d modelling for a while. I got two computers with hardcore video cards and wanted to set them up to just start doing remote renders if I put a file in place. I would have a script running on one machine (The master node) and it would check a dropbox folder for a file every 30 seconds. I never got around to writing the script to update the SQL database, so I had to do it manually, but it would go something like this. If rendering = 0, check for file. if file is there, check if size is correct. if size is correct, copy to x folder and y folder (One was the local machine, the other was a network mapped location on the other machine.) Check file sizes again. Once size are correct, create output folders for images on each machine and open Blender with the file. Then it would wait 2 minutes to make sure the file was fully open and then send the key combo to start an animation render (via the slave node script, which ran on both machines). One machine would be set to do the first half of the frames and the other machine did the second half. 
Back in 2004 the MSP I worked at rolled out a remote backup program for our clients (rsync+ssh+cygwin+VSS (windows clients)+rsnapshot). At the time I didn't have much python experience, but the bash script I had written to analyze the logs and generate+email reports was getting a little hairy, so I figured I'd give it a try and see if I could clean things up. It's definitely not the *coolest* script I wrote, but it was my first dive into the language, and I haven't looked back!
I've used it, but haven't devoted the time it would take to really learn it. Most employers are ArcGIS shops, so that's where I've put most of my effort, and I have other side projects I prefer over learning Q. It is by all accounts a lovely program, though.
Should have offered to sell it to them! But I guess if you make them aware it exists, they could claim they own it since you built it during work hours. Were they not aware that you had ~4 times the productivity of their next best people?
Now just have it run once a minute and get paid way more!
Awesome! Will take a look.
I'd just recommend getting a entry level laptop over getting a chromebook. While it is possible to use the Chromebook its just too much effort to preform a simple task that a pc/mac/linux machine would preform in seconds
the coincidence here is my names kevin, and I am currently at work. but it needs to be approved by my supervisor, so I can't really cheat the system :(
Like Steve_Evo was saying the easiest way to fix install pyglet is through pip. After reading your conversation it looks like you were left hanging on how to set up your python path ! If your using python 2.7 this command will do the trick: setx PATH C:\Python27 (for python 3 replace the '27' with a '32') Enter that into your cmd and restart your cmd and when you try to run get-pip.py by running python get-pip.py python should work without problem. If this command does not work your going to have to edit your environment variables, a quick google should point you to the answer. 
Great idea. Qt Creator is the best IDE I've used, but it just doesn't have a enough features for Python development. I have an abusive co-dependent relationship with Eclipse, because I haven't been able to find a good alternative to PyDev. There's LiClipse, but it's not OSS and I'd rather get away from Java completely. Have you looked at https://github.com/davidsansome/pyqtc ?
https://gist.github.com/menatankush/1530249b642647d02a52 Reading jokes while working in command line. RTV is too flashy.
they also provide profiling tools for python and 2 related webinars are coming soon (I signed up)
oh god... well at least now I am programming more types of programs and scripting more sophisticated porn retrieval scripts 
We are doing some experiments with OBIA (object based image analysis) and hopefully we'll be able to post about it soon.
Thanks a lot!
you need to fix these two lines `randomNumber = random.randrange(0,100)` you dont need the `guess = -1` and `guess != randomNumber` lines also you need to put this into a loop, preferably a `while` loop. so you can keep guessing, otherwise you'll just go through your if/elif statements only once. `guess = -1 ` you assign guess as -1, but 2 lines down you assign it another input from user. so no need for this line. `guess != randomNumber` this tests for equality between those two, which will always return false, because randomNumber can only be a value between 0 and 100 (excluding 100). The result from this equality test are not used anywhere, at the moment, either. If you want to include 100 in your random range, change `random.randrange(0,100)` to `(0,101)` 
It doesn't work like that, and you can run Python code in non-Python applications. For example, Jedi is a Python library that provides static analysis and autocompletion for Python code, yet you can embed it for use with a C editor like Vim.
Ahhh awesome, thanks for the quick reply! I'm going to run it in the command line right now.
Haha, I know, right? He was good at what he did, but once he built the server infrastructure for the site, he was the only one who knew how to import the codes. And since the codes were a core feature of the business model, *someone* had to do it. I don't know how long he was manually importing codes before they hired me, since it was a relatively new company when I started. The best part is, everyone grumbled at first when I said I was going to use Python, since I was the only one (!) who knew it. But I promised to make the whole process so easy an intern could do it. On my last day, I dropped all the source code in a github, wrote a five page document called "App Importing: How To Do Everything" and trained the CTO and one of the work interns. To my knowledge, they used it until the app shut down. Not bad for something I wrote my first month on the job that let me play free iPod games at work. :)
If you want to catch exceptions, you need to use try/except. Check out the [Python Docs on Handling Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions). In terms of shorting your assignment for variables a through g, this would be a good time to practice using a List Comprehension. [This guide may be helpful for learning it](http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Comprehensions.html) or Google "Python List Comprehension". Also, if you have any more questions, you'll get better help on r/learnpython. This subreddit is for news and discussions (as per the sidebar). It also helps to have a more descriptive title. And finally, is there one site or class that has a GTIN-8 assignment? This is the second question about it today.
Probably the same people, due in tomorrow ;) Do you mind if I ask you one quick question instead of making a new thread? How do I make this work: 'if len(basenumber) =! 7, 8:' It always just says invalid syntax? 
Out of curiosity, what do you run it on? Do you have a Raspberry Pi or something?
+1 I've used Numpy + MKL before not sure what will be different, looks just like official support now.
Pandas, for example, does this. 
That's nice but using VBA I need to have the sheets opened right? 
There is [That book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1491912057/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=3L9U8NUT0XJY8&amp;coliid=I1XKP46DIODFH2) coming out in 10 days by Jake VanderPlas. I haven't read it yet (obviously) but his youtube lectures are great.
`from redbull import blueberry`
2.7 is still widely used, and 3.5 has a lot to offer in improvements. 3.5 is making good strides for adoption over 2.7. I would learn 3, as it's going to eventually be the defacto, but it's very important to understand the differences between 2 and 3, and possibly why they exist. Python3 didn't break backwards compatibility lightly and the core dev's had good reason. If you use LPTHW which was written in 2, you may find a lot of the answers along the way as you google around for why your code worked differently from the book (if you decide to use python3). Considering the title, could work out well for you. Best of luck! 
I wrote a webcrawler using selenium and a few other programs to go to many different pages with many individual links to download all the pdfs, sometime in the 100's, and then combine the pdfs and tifs to one file with its unique identifier. It also would grab production data and a few other things. Took two weeks of work down to a day running in the background. 
His arguments are old and outdated. I think you can probably get through it if you're willing to put up with the occasional bug in his code that will need to be updated to 3 (print, xrange, raw_input, etc). 
Using numpy import numpy as np np.dot(np.array([int(x) for x in list(GTIN)]),np.array([3,1,3,1,3,1,3]))
no, i'm saying when it is acting on only one element the standard library is faster (almost always) becuase there is no numpy overhead. for example, `math.log` is 6x faster than `numpy.log` if you are using it on a single number. yes, once you are looping it is much faster to use arrays, but many people think that this speed increase will carry over to scalars, and they don't test it. 
Ya if you look at the code you can see I used some of that guy's stuff and I was originally doing it with a Dash button. Click the button play a song. It was pretty cool. Not as cool as walking through your door and having music blasting announcing your presence though.
sum( int(x)*(i % 2 or 3) for i,x in enumerate(GTIN) )
Thanks for the suggestion. From what I've seen those spreadsheets use a lot of VLOOKUP. You think that would be too hard to implement using Pandas?
I cleaned it up and added timeout protection etc. Now, if you're on Ubuntu, it doesn't keep taking X resources. https://github.com/masasin/himawaripy
You need to speech recognition module. On Linux: sudo pip install SpeechRecognition OS X, Windows and other: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SpeechRecognition
Didn't understand this "In your case you'd have to rewrite to another final file" what do you mean? I've tried using the r/w only modes and they are indeed faster but I didn't find out a way to copy a column from a sheet and put it into another sheet with a column offset.
I use an IDE to get my job done. Whichever one helps me do that the best is the IDE that I pick. I'm on a powerful machine with 16GB of RAM and this machine is common, so "heavy-weight" vs "light-weight" isn't a factor at all. I couldn't care less what programming language/processor/motherboard or video card a developer used to create my IDE. If I like it, I'll use it. That being said, I don't see anything on par with PyCharm right now so I won't even consider anything else. When someone comes out with a better IDE, regardless of which language it was written in, I'll switch immediately. 
Instead of opening, changing and saving, you'd have to open the original file read only and write row by row to a new file (with your changes). The more I think about this the harder it could be. Formatting, formulas, graphs. 
Twisted is great! You should already know the basic of sockets and the web.
Don't think you need the `"".join()` since you're doing a good old string concatenation there... great refinement though!
Company can own all the code they want. But it doesn't mean I have to document it.
Ah, I think those names are silly because it should already be immediately obvious that the software is for Python, given that it is likely to be downloaded/installed via the cheeseshop. NumPy and SciPy I feel are playful titles, and I like the use there. I hate redundant namespacing :)
I do add this namespacing for domain names, though (e.g. python-requests.org). Not redundant there, and better for discoverability. I was torn for a long time about whether to do so or not on GitHub as well ‚Äî determined that if I was going to be mostly building a brand around Python software, then dropping the prefix would be fine (you'll note most prolific developers from other communities do the same). 
if len(basenumber) != 7 or 8: print("Incorrect Input. Please try again.") continue I tried this but it just does it no matter what I enter?
Thanks for sharing - that's a handy collection of notebooks
The problem is that I don't and I want to learn that while doing stuff in python with it.
"incredibly simple" my a$$ :)
Meh.
Ah, yeah that's makes sense and it's definitely good to know. Though usually if you're using a numpy operation like that on a scalar, you're not calling it too many times so the speed difference doesn't really matter. 
I wanted to be able to better forecast expected contacts into our call centre for malware outbreaks, so I tackled it as my first project. It's actually how I learned to use Python. It used 10 years worth of our logs to capture a 'lifecycle' for every threat we had ever encountered. It then tried to sort them by family and then category. The end result was that as soon as we identified the category of a new threat, we could estimate its impact, if we could then narrow it down to a family we had a more accurate forecast. I now produce a regular report from it that contains every threat name, country and date of first contact, and expected weekly volumes for three months. It's allowed us to be a lot more accurate with forecasting than previously. It's nothing particularly exciting, but it was the first thing I ever tackled, and the project that made me move from Perl -&gt; Python. 
&gt; `json_loc, headers={'User-Agent': 'Bored programmer\'s bot'})` That's the most honest user agent string I have ever seen.
Hi, I'm currently taking a computer networking class in school. It's taught in Python and uses the book Computer Networking A Top Down Approach (I'll link a download below). Python's socket module is pretty much all you need to get started learning, which the textbook covers nicely. Python also offers a bunch of modules for network programming that makes life a lot easier, too. Oh and by the way the text uses Python 2.7, but I'm pretty sure any version of Python is fine, there might be some little things that you'll have to change around. Here are some links! http://tools.ietf.org/html/ - docs for all the different protocols you'll be learning about. [Textbook](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjiyc_C8MPLAhVF6SYKHTh7BcwQFggcMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tarfandestan.com%2Fforum%2Fattachments%2F128415d1364149567-fqo47-computer-networking-a-topdown-approach-6th-edition-pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNEkzpnGokKF1MNK8_sHZ8FI6cAf0w&amp;sig2=4wrdH2dWfYmNOxseA7jAUw&amp;bvm=bv.116636494,d.eWE) - pdf download There's also a ton of different resources out there about more specific topics in networking that you can google and find answers to in Python. Also, what helps me learn is doing little projects like making a HTTP webserver, SMTP mail client, do something with multicast, google around for some more projects. 
There's a few different resources. Udemy has a course to develop 7 different networking apps. Plus there a book that came out last year that covers more advanced topics. Can't remember the names, but a little googling will find them.
Thanks I'll give it a try!
Did you just listen to the latest [talkpythontome](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/50/web-scraping-at-scale-with-scrapy-and-scrapinghub) podcast? youtube has a few that are pretty cool, other then that, you may want to look at the project page itself, it has a tutorial to help you get started. 
Python turned a four-six hour job into a 10 minute job for me. Where I used to work we had to pull rpm and iso files from various build locations. These were pre-delivery; they weren't QA'd together yet. Before I could hand the product and the development rpms to a partner I need to test them first. I wrote a python program that was driven by a template giving the base URLs of the builds I wanted to marshall files for. To do it manually, one had to navigate through 60-80 files to find the six-ten we needed. The file names changed but sub-strings didn't, so I create a whitelist-blacklist semantic to the template. Anyhow, in the end, I'd edit the template, run it, and within a few minutes have the files I needed. The script then installed the rpms into the test VM, ran a build, and checked for the desired output file. If it existed, that meant that the rpms were functional - that was a smoke test. The script also tar'd and gzipped the files, and created a manifest containing the rpms, the isos, their md5sums, the md5sums of the tgz files, etc. This means we also had a record of EXACTLY what files we sent to WHICH partner, from which builds, and when. This can get checked into a repository so that months later, partners could say, "Oh, we never got that!" And we could say, well, we sent exactly these things to you on this day. Plus, if the checksums were off, we could go back and compare to what we sent. It also produced a logfile containing the template and a list of what files were included, what were excluded from the build. This means it could be reproduced. Every sandbox build was no longer a mystery build. It was repeatable and documented. It automated absolutely everything. We had an intern doing this every day for at least 4 hours. I turned it into a 10 minute task. If the smoketest failed, that's another 10 minutes out of your life, kid. Finally he was free to do something else, like write code and do useful work. And so was I. 
Seriously, I'm doing a couple things right now that people would consider complicated, and dealing with printer output with old impact stuff is a fucking pain in the ass and not at all simple. I'm still dealing with ancient programs written in FoxPro 2 and DBase III. Sending codes, and the right codes, for each printer emulation type, to position each character, which character, and start/stop font and LPI/CPI characters. It's just a nightmare to deal with. So don't sell yourself short /u/emptythevoid , what you did was damn impressive.

Your math-functions must be above the main function. Otherwise you can not call them. http://i.imgur.com/exqAbbW.png
awesome!!! will check, thanks.
Been meaning to look into this. Youre encouraging me. :)
Perhaps the Intel distribution is compiled with ICC?
If you want to use or, you have to use two complete inequalities. Also, I meant to say 'and.' But if I was right by saying to use 'or' this would still be wrong. When you say... if len(basenumber) != 7 or 8: ...Python interprets that as two different truth statements. First, it checks 'is len(basement) not equal to 7?' Done. Now moving on to the second inequality. '8?' all by itself, no comparison or anything, and just '8' evaluates to True. Python interprets 0 as False, and any other Integer as True. So it doesn't matter what basenumber is, because it's always going to evaluate to 'or True.' That might not be the best explanation, but tl;dr: if len(basenumber) != 7 and len(basenumber) != 8: print("Incorrect Input. Please try again.") But again, I think the clearest way to write it is if len(basenumber) not in (7, 8):
I think what he means is you should post this to /learnpython. Also I would go back and look up function augments.
Take a video "full album" of youtube with timestamps of songs in the description. Download the video, convert it to music, parse description then recreate the whole album by splitting the big audio file and tag individual files. I'm a bit ashamed tbh.

I had a task at work that was repetitive and monotonous. It took forever to get it done, sometimes longer than a day. After about a year of coding, improving, and refactoring, I coded my way out of that job and moved into a place where I could write shared code for others to benefit from. It was a win-win.

Loved the interactive stuff.
Nice! Now at least Google can find it :)
I've used the Anaconda MKL version of NumPy for a while (years). Where it seems to make a noticeable difference is in anything that touches BLAS/LAPACK. For that sort of thing, the plots in the article comparing performance are completely in line with what I've seen. Everything else, not much difference. Even disabling the threading I get a bump in performance, though obviously not as big.
Sharing is caring 
&gt; I'm running the python files out of command line, but often I can't even do that, due to sometimes it telling me that the path is not an internal or external command, yet it will work with the same path when I rollback the script that I have. Try just running "python" from the command line. If you don't get the Python version number and the `&gt;&gt;&gt;` prompt, that means Python isn't accessible where you are running your script from. To fix that, you need to add the location where Python is installed (e.g., `C:\Program Files (x86)\Python`) to `%PATH%`. [Here are some steps](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm) you can take on how to do that.
Learn how HTTP (one of the simplest protocols) works. Then build a Python web server using nothing but the sockets library. I guarantee you once you can do that, you will have learned a lot. Google every exception or error you get as well, it's all been encountered before.
I made a small script that downloads songs from youtube videos, getting the song name from the command line or a list of songs via a text file.

It's a great course. The only problem for the OP is that the coursework is done in Matlab/Octave and not Python.
Networks in language terms are mainly communication protocols and you don't need to know about c and it's low level memory management, etc to understand passing text based commands around a network. Python has the sockets library and that's low level enough - chose your protocol on top of that. IMO of course.
I know you didn't ask for libraries but there's scikit-learn http://scikit-learn.org/stable/ Sometimes seeing results and tinkering can help with understanding. 
These are excellent! 
Appreciate it! :) 
I used the example code in this for my dash button and the latency was kinda not that great, like 5 seconds or more. I managed to get it down to ~1 second using another library. 
Cool, I will have a play with this
Don't go through LPTHW.
There's a couple of basic kind of servers that you can write using python that will illustrate the various kinds of networking programming. One task I give to novice engineers to quickly gain skill, is to write a pub/sub server. You need to handle the event loop, implement the socket, manage connections, and manage routing. I then ask for tests, documentation, and a demonstration client.
I appreciate creative projects but this is really more of "how to install Ok Google with python bindings". I'd already have google installed if I wanted to let a massive surveillance network in. :/
I don't have much experience but I found TextBlob much easier to pick up and use than NLTK.
I've always wanted to use Selenium for stuff like this, but I always shy away since Selenium is a testing framework. Does it work well for automating menial web tasks? Is there something better?
Depends on the checks you are writing. You can do the same in VBA.
probably being more lightweight. If you just want to read a csv, pandas is a bloated lib to have as a dependency in a project.
I have a genuine question here, what are the advantages of using panda's csv module over the default Python csv module?
As well as being a much more lightweight dependency, it's a somewhat simpler API (ie reading and writing regular dictionaries instead of having to get used to the pandas API, which is great but one extra hassle if you're not already familiar with it). The stdlib module sucks and having a simple alternative is useful imo.
well the speech_regonation module supports also other apis (like IBM and AT&amp;T ) but I guess they aren't any better. Not sure about this since I just started exploring this, but I think the CMUSphinx runs locally. But maybe I misinterpreted something here.

Pandas is designed for data analysis and wrangling, so anything you want to do downstream will likely be others of magnitude easier (example code would be 3 lines, not a huge gain in this case). It also supports vectorized functions so it will be much faster. 
Violent Python covers a lot of network concepts in kind of a fun way, and is very beginner friendly.
You mean csv for Humans?
"... for humans" is so yesterday.
you can use pandas: it has an importer for excel (pyxll based) and the analytic is then trivial.
You can use [extensions](http://textblob.readthedocs.org/en/dev/extensions.html) to add more languages, but there are only two available: German and French. I haven't used them, so I can't comment more on that subject.
It is build on top of NLTK and provides a cleaner API that can help you get your job done quickly.
I'm currently using the stdlib's csv module on python3 and I haven't had any trouble with it. Is there anything I should be aware of? Unicode doesn't seem to be a problem, for example (but that's because I'm using 3, I suppose).

Thank you!
I would recommend to not use LPTHW, it is not the best it is condescending and teaches things in a weird unintuitive way (and also wrong/outdated e.g no .format() for strings). Some people explained why they thought it was not the best in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/40s6dm/meta_can_we_take_learn_python_the_hard_way_off/) Now better teaching resources exist like CodeAcadamy, Automate the Boring Stuff with Python ect. I would recommend you to use those
It's cool, but in your example you have to delete a column from each row one at a time! That seems quite wasteful.. the representation "dict per row" seems kind of bloated, memory-wise. I can see it being useful for a streaming library of some kind though, where you really want to consider things one row at a time.
Yeah namedtuple would be the better choice for this except for a few deficiencies: 1. Because you access by instance.column_name that restricts the column names. They cannot have punctuation or spaces, and therefore it is totally unsuitable for most csv files. 2. Dynamic access is weird. instance[var_containing_column_name] doesn't work, instead you have to getattr(instance, var_containing_column_name). 3. Adding/removing columns requires instantiating a new type and copying everything over. On the other hand you can take slices, which is great!! I think no matter how you handle this you end up going down the rabbit hole of having to implement something that might as well be a pandas.DataFrame. Certainly though calling `del row["column"]` is clearly wrong. Now you have a row that lacks a column that every other row does have... which makes your table... well not a table. 
The issue is that Python 2's `csv` module doesn't work with Unicode strings, whereas Python 3's doesn't work with byte strings. This isn't an issue if you're handling plain ('native') `str`ings, but if you're handed Unicode, you're gonna have a bad time.
For me the biggest advantage is having the result in a pandas dataframe, for data manipulation it's a huge part of my workflow. It's also got a host of additional [read](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html#input-output)/[write](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html#id12) APIs that work in a similar fashion, so bringing data together from multiple sources is much more straightforward.
over in /r/dailyprogrammer we're doing some basic IRC bot construction challenges, and python's a popular language there. between some examples there and the socket module docs you should be off to a good start. one of the biggest things that people forget about networking is when they read from the network, they forget that unlike reading a file there is no way for the program to know "yep, you're at the end". so you have to read in chunks and work with it that way. that and error handling, detecting when you've gotten disconnected and handling it gracefully. otherwise it's not too complex and can be picked up pretty easily. between the socket module docs and TCP/IP illustrated you'll be a master in no time. 
From what little work I've done with CSV, I've learned one thing: The only assumption about the format of a CSV file you can make is that you can't make any assumptions about its format, especially not that it's well formatted. Thus, there is no such thing as painless CSV.
Actually our investors want us to be successful, and they realize that can only happen if we continue to be good stewards and participants in the Python, SciPy, and PyData communities. We are trying to build a legitimate, long-view company that fosters open source by encouraging enterprise adoption. Nothing hurts and frustrates me more than when I see people from within the Python community spreading FUD about what we might or might not do. I expect that from big legacy vendors of proprietary products, and have lots of marketing guidance on how to deal with that, by speaking to the power of open source, etc. But when people from the user community that we serve (and love) make comments like this, I'm really at a loss.... what are we supposed to do? Solve problems and give things away for free? We do that. Invest precious time and resources into organizing community events, even though sometimes competitors show up and hawk their wares? We do that. Hire key devs of major Python OSS projects like pandas, matplotlib, spyder, jupyter, etc. and make sure they are paid market wages while being able to work on their OSS projects? **We do that.** &gt; Anaconda is a for profit company Every company on earth is for-profit. That's like saying humans are for-oxygen. If you want to distinguish between businesses and non-profits (or universities, which are actually incredibly profit-driven), then you're relegating open source to only being able to be developed by people in their spare time, which is not sustainable. What differentiates companies and what matters the most is what their missions are. Continuum Analytics is a very mission-driven company and our goal is to help more people connect with more data. A huge part of that mission involves advancing the state of the art in Python for scientific and data analysis, in open source. 
 'mpg321' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. How do I fix this error? It's prohibiting the program to speak.
Firstly, I am not saying it's impossible that you will be fair in the exchange between what you charge people and how much you contribute to the community. I am saying that that choice is no longer yours to make, now that your legal obligation is to maximize profit for stake holders. If you were a public benefit corporation, e.g. kickstarter, that had legal avenues to determine their level of contribution then I wouldnt be concerned. I do not doubt your integrity or authenticity, it's the investors who I doubt. If you have evidence to the contrary I will happily retract my statements.
please don't beat the dead horse...
If we're being honest, if you need Unicode support in general and don't rely on a third-party library such as PyICU, you're gonna have a bad time.
This means great things for python devs, even those who are not going. Maybe next year i will make it.
Looking forward to looking at it. I haven't timed this one: https://github.com/mkleehammer/servant 
The idea isn't so bad, it's just the wrong platform to utilize something like this. I made something like this that converted arbitrary binary data into encrypted noise images and uploaded them to various image hosters. The links to the images I wrote to an output file. Afterwards it was possibly to use the script to download the file back given such an information file and even easily fix missing parts. It was quite neat.
So what? That's meaningless. There's an entire conference dedicated to Plone every year. Yet Plone is dying. On the other hand, there's entire conferences held around the world dedicated to scientific python and related tools, yet PyCon US is full of talks for scientific python and related tools. 
As I mentioned in the README, this is more of a weekend just-because-I-can hack than anything else. As far as the idea/abuse goes, this isn't new-- it's been done before ([RedditStorage](https://github.com/Rossem/RedditStorage)), and the admins [responded](https://np.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/38kn2g/redditstorage_a_cloud_storage_that_uses_reddit_as/crvx3tp) to it. Anyways, I'm bored and this is just for fun. :-)
&gt;delete a column from each row one at a time! Wouldn't these loops take ages to run for more sophisticated data cleaning algorithms on larger datasets? Pandas is already infuriatingly slow if you use indexing in loops
Investors are not always stupid nor near-sighted. Maximizing profit is about area under the curve over the long term, not about shooting oneself in the foot to achieve some temporary heights in the short term. Continuum could probably make a LOT more money this quarter if we shifted everyone over to doing Django consulting. None of our investors would even dream of suggesting such an inane thing. Since you asked, our investors have a long history in the open source world. Our partner at General Catalyst was product manager at Redhat, and then CEO of Typesafe, the Scala company. He was involved in the Cloudera investment while he was at Greylock. He's been involved at the intersection of open source and business for a long time. I think it's fair to say that if RHEL had not been successful as a product, you and I would very likely be using Solaris or AIX right now instead of deploying Linux everywhere. Our lead investor from BuildGroup was the former CEO of Rackspace, which is a huge proponent of open source, and it was under his leadership that Rackspace created OpenStack. You can read my blog post from back in July if you want more perspective: https://www.continuum.io/content/empowering-data-scientists-journey
today we're programming for transentient babies.
you probably should get a jump on the singularities. Those AIs will need a lot of microservices just to figure out how to fuck things up as badly as humans.
As others have stated in a few ways: Pandas supports data analysis, and has some transformation features. So, if you're analyzing csv files - Pandas can be a good way to read them in. But it can be extremely slow, so using it in a pipeline to prepare data for later analysis doesn't work well with large files.
Until morale improves.
Hi, remember to use a headline that says something about your question not just "I am new to python". Otherwise lots of people will skip reading it. The headline for this post for example could have been "Where do I post to find a help with a program?" 
In my experience most csv files are a few hundred rows and generated because some manager wants a file they can play with in excel. So performance is not really an issue. If you have a large amount of data you're probably better off loading it into an actual database.
Dict-per-row is what the stdlib uses, and csvx uses the stdlib under the hood. Using OrderedDicts definitely will slow things down a bit, but is better for convenience. But if you have a large amount of data you're better off loading it into a database and working with it there, or using pandas, or whatever.
You mean something like that? def substraction(num1, num2): return num1-num2 def addition(num1, num2): return num1+num2 def division(num1, num2): return num1/num2 def multiplication(num1, num2): return num1*num2 while True: action = input("Division, multiplication, addition, or subtraction? ") n1 = float(input("What is your first number? ")) n2 = float(input("What is your second number? ")) if action == "multiplication": print(multiplication(n1, n2)) elif action == "division": print(division(n1, n2)) elif action == "addition": print (addition(n1, n2)) elif action == "substraction": print (substraction(n1, n2)) again = input("Again? y/n") if again == "n": break You can try to work with some try/exceptions to catch wrong inputs from user ;) edit: Use Sublime or Pycharm as editor. You will thank me later.
I might be out of my element trying to discuss either! Sorry friend. If I wanted to understand more about both - where should I start? I'm not sure if you ever saw the Google experiment "rollit" for chrome - it was using websockets to connect your phone browser session to a desktop browser session for the purpose of a game. I'd really like to tinker around replicating parts of it so I can build something similar. That's really my goal, and I see alot of nodejs talk thrown around when it comes to websockets and I have no background in js so I'd like to try and see what I can do in Python
Speaking from experience, so your miles may vary, but I learned networking programming through by learning both networking and programming at the same time and it was HARD, it can be very discouraging, even if you're motivated. I'm taking a Networking class atm and it would have made my life so much easier if I understood how networking worked conceptually before attempting any practical applications. I would recommend learning networking first before attempting to combine the two. Just my two cents.
Thank you so much, I will look at pycharm or sublime. I dont know what try/exceptions are but I will do some research and play around with them. Thanks!
It is 2016! The danger is that you are already outdated if you learn py2.x today...

Cool stuff. You should cross post this on /r/nba .
Did you create your own corpus, or are you using the default corpus being used by NaiveBayes (Which I think is the default analyzer when you don't call it out, which your code doesn't appear to specify) I like the idea of a default corpus, but can be irrelevant for organizations that don't have conversations that are centered around movie review (Which the default corpus is from) http://textblob.readthedocs.org/en/dev/classifiers.html
Better than AN69Y claim!
How would PyICU help in this instance? 
Yep, agreed.
Hi, Firstly these questions should be directed more towards r/learnpython That being said to achieve what you want you can get the index of each character in your string, and append 0s based on the index number to get the output you are describing. Code: http://pastebin.com/MdmDMVzd dan@valla ~$ python tmp.py Enter a string: abc &gt; 101001 dan@valla ~$ python tmp.py Enter a string: test &gt; 0000000000000000000100001000000000000000000100000000000000000001 
Do you have a particular reason to download the video files instead of just the audio? Because [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/) will let you directly download only the audio track.
Great resource for learning networking here, starts at ground zero and builds up through IPv4 / v6 to QoS, routing and security: http://intronetworks.cs.luc.edu/current/html/ Yes, it's a lot of material. But networking is a deep subject. Sure, one can write a chat or web server with a few lines of code, but if you don't know much about networking, you'll never be able to debug that code. Once you learn enough networking, Python's documentation will start to make sense, and your "how would I apply it to Python" question will answer itself.
There is also unicodecsv: https://github.com/jdunck/python-unicodecsv It's a drop-in replacement for the stdlib's csv module for python2 and it removes all the unicode issues. 
Sorry :( voice recognition is cool but can be frustrating. I didn't play with Sphinx for very long; perhaps you'll be able to tune it better than I did! 
Is the AI webscale?
I occasionally use [tablib](http://docs.python-tablib.org/en/latest/) which has been around for a while. Besides CSV and TSV it also does XLS, XLSX and some other formats. I kinda prefer to use XLS over CSV if I have to send the file to other people, support is kinda ubiquitous and it has less problems when opening it in their random tools.
actually yes, pandas is pretty good at parsing and at least for me it is usually painless (working with data coming from lab instruments, they are easy to parse) 
I recommend PyQt or PySide **edit:** Sorry I was eating my sammitch. Lemme explain a little further. PyQt and PySide have a built in class/view for generating forms [QFormLayout](http://srinikom.github.io/pyside-docs/PySide/QtGui/QFormLayout.html). 
Not PyICU specifically. Just some library that is Unicode aware. In this case, no, PyICU probably wouldn't be of much utility.
I have no idea, but it doesn't list external dependencies. In my experience you just pip install and do your thing. I mostly use it for generating reports or dumps so I'm not sure about import capabilities (readme is very short). CSV import works at least, and no complaints about the XLS/XLSX export.
Even if low level production networking code would not be written in python, it does make sense to prototype low level networking code in python. The python socket facilities closely mirror the C ones, so a python prototype could easily be translated into efficient C.

I use wincom to email a pandas dataframe to_html through outlook. It's a simple pivot table summary which is emailed daily automatically. The pivot table is a bit ugly. Can I format it?
Don't let the haters get you down. I thought this was really cool! Its always neat to find new places to stash files.
I'm sure I could have, but it was one of my first python scripts.
Downloads from [here](http://www.mpg123.de/download/win64/?V=1&amp;O=D). Then extract to a folder of your choosing (this will be the "install folder") and [add that folder to the PATH](http://windowsitpro.com/systems-management/how-can-i-add-new-folder-my-system-path). Use the directory where "mpg321.exe" is located, sometimes it's in a subdirectory like "bin".
Do you have any suggestions as to where I could learn it conceptually first?
Thank you so much for showing me example code. The problem is I don't even know the basics of networking, for example, I don't know what UDP and TCP are except that they are network protocols.
https://www.cybrary.it/video/slides-part-2/ Its free to sign up and this is an online course that will teach you python. This video/lesson specifically will teach you basic networking concepts, and how to utilize them in python. (in no way am I affiliated with cybrary, I just find their resources useful and am using them to self learn.)
This comment is so helpful! The link you gave is to mpg123, not mpg321, will I change the numbering within my code then? Any idea on [this] (http://imgur.com/Sevn1pt) error? I changed the code to mpg123 
Thank you! I'll look that up.
It depends on what you want to do to be honest but VBA is way easier to pick up than python. Sample Code Function CountFilesInFolder(byval folderpath As String) As Integer Dim path As String Dim count As Integer Dim filename As String path = folderpath &amp; "*.xl*" filename = Dir(path) count = 0 Do While filename &lt;&gt; "" count = count + 1 filename = Dir() Loop CountFilesInFolder = count End Function
&gt; and the admins responded to it I feel like you didn't actually read that response
Yes. This is exactly what I wanted. Maybe I should've been clear. I'd just like to have something where I can load an excel file into and it would run through it and come back with its findings. no needs to write anything to file. Just be able to read and check against the rules/format things supposed to be adhering to. your links should set me on the right path though. Thanx.
hmmm. ok so how do i fix this? is there any way to do so
Uh oh. I double checked the numbers before I posted but I must have had temporary dyslexia :( I read somewhere that mpg321 is a fork of mpg123 but mostly the same interface. I'm afraid I have no idea how to fix the error you're seeing.

Cryptographic hashes like md5 and sha1sum do not provide authenticity or integrity (or confidentiality), so it's not guaranteed that if the checksum passes, the data has not been tampered with. If an attacker guesses that a file contains certain data, the attacker could easily verify this by just computing the hash. This could be bad if you were storing data like your bank account number - it could easily be bruteforced because the attacker already knows what the hash is, and they could spin up an EC2 instance and just go through all the possibilities. A better way to ensure integrity is to use message authentication codes - PyCrypto implements these. In either case, neither provide confidentiality. A common technique is to encrypt the data, and then take a MAC over the encryption, this provides both integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity. You could also just use authenticated encryption.
My employer uses SAS, and has gone to the economical implementation of it sold by WPS. I can see SAS failing in real time. I'm learning python to help cope!
Yeah proprietary you're selling some features people will pay to have them right now... and you keep building on them and open source stuff keeps catching up... eventually if you have nothing to add to stay ahead you 'lose' ... except your goal was more to make that pile of money, and you kinda succeeded in doing that.

Hi, do you find any projects that use python decorator very cool? Please add it to the list!
Well, it puts reddit to an unintended use, in a way that is actively damaging to reddit. What else does abuse mean?
hey man i know how it is to be new so am gonna help you out as much as i can. For one thing in your main function, dont return year because it will call the get input function and then stop. What you want is something like this def main(): year = get_input() print_zodiac_animal(year) def get_input(): year = int(input('Input a year (ex: 2013): ')) return year def print_zodiac_animal(year): signs = ['monkey', 'rooster', 'dog', 'pig', 'rat',\ 'ox', 'tiger', 'rabbit', 'dragon',\ 'snake', 'horse', 'sheep'] print(year, 'is the year of the', signs[year % len(signs)])) main() note that i changed the return year to passing it to the function print_zodiac_animal(). Think of the main function as a remote controller. In this controller is where you call all the functions necessary for your code to work Edit: edited to include the modulus of the year as given by /u/iniy

Pandas' ExcelFile object is an excellent choice for reading xls data, but it sounds like your requirements are better handled by Excel's built in data validation. Just google excel data validation. I think this will get you most of the way from your above description.
A few comments about your code: 1. Your code is organized as an app serving a certain set of pages and not as a framework. You might want to organize the code as a library with a setup.py in the root. 2. Another thing which you can improve is separating the template and static files into an example folder along with example code to serve them. 3. Config is defined, but not used (e.g. - https://github.com/xevrem/pahs/blob/master/pahs.py#L35) 4. All your files start with a shebang. Do you really plan on running each one as a script? Also it's better to use `#!/usr/bin/env python` than the path you use in your own dev environment. 5. There doesn't seem to be a very clear reasoning for organizing functions/classes in different files. For example app.py and content.py don't seem to be so different in scope. 6. https://github.com/xevrem/pahs/blob/e97c381a5aa320871a36df57b6bb5cc652981380/pahs.py#L115 - I see two problems here `parse_route` is an ambigous name in this context. The other problem relates to the result: you should probably return something more specific than a `re.match` object which you then need to process in the caller.
It is still fairly raw, but I have it on good authority that Dropbox is starting to annotate their high value code and has a team working to make that practical (for their giant codebase) so it is okay and rapidly getting better. I fully annotated a 2.7 project today and found a bug and some cases where I was playing fast and loose with unicode/str.. I have 95%+ test coverage, so finding real issues in an hour of tinkering was surprising.
All I want is phone calls and texting via Alexa. That's all I want to make it pretty much the most useful device in my home. 
It's hard to get excited about it without proper currying. You won't be able to do: ['a','b','c'] |&gt; map(str.capitalize)
Because reduce is very rarely more readable than a regular loop, because it almost always calls for a hideous python lambda. It's still there in the standard library if you need it. Here's what Guido has to say about it: &gt; So now reduce(). This is actually the one I've always hated most, because, apart from a few examples involving + or *, almost every time I see a reduce() call with a non-trivial function argument, I need to grab pen and paper to diagram what's actually being fed into that function before I understand what the reduce() is supposed to do. So in my mind, the applicability of reduce() is pretty much limited to associative operators, and in all other cases it's better to write out the accumulation loop explicitly. Also, we now have `sum`, `all`, and `any`, which is like 90% of the readable use cases for reduce anyway.
- I wrote a trivial one that strips all trailing whitespace from lines of a file, and the end of the file, and ensures that it ends in a newline - I wrote a simple but easily extensible regex-based gcc output colorizer - I wrote a script that harvests a webcomic. You supply it with a pair of BeautifulSoup selectors- one for the image, and one for the "next" button. It was mostly an exercise in aiohttp programming.
Yeah, i realised that way too late, i'm sorry... 
No problem!
The decorators in tri.declarative are pretty cool I think (full disclosure: I'm a coauthor): https://github.com/TriOptima/tri.declarative/blob/master/README.rst#class-decorators
Look up the module operator. 
Run it with Python3.5 I got ``` Input a year (ex: 2013): 2014 (2014, 'is the year of the', ['monkey', 'rooster', 'dog', 'pig', 'rat', 'ox', 'tiger', 'rabbit', 'dragon', 'snake', 'horse', 'sheep']) ``` I guess you want to do this: ``` print(year, 'is the year of the', signs[year % len(signs)]) ```

I don't understand it to be honest: given your constant troubles with Cassandra, shouldn't you consider and maybe get excited about switching to rafs as your storage backend?
it seemed to work fine and it created the executable but the .exe itself doesn't work could it be because simpleGUI was not one of the "supported packages" in pyinstaller?

In my experience, the main problem with expensive data processing software at universities is not that they aren't as good, but that the support isn't there. When I'm a student using Python or R and something doesn't work like I expect, I can go on StackOverflow or IRC and get an answer in 5 minutes. When I'm using SuperExpensiveSoftware X and something doesn't work like I expect, there's a vanishingly small online community, and the way actual customers get help is calling SuperExpensiveSoftware Company and get one-on-one support, so I'm SOL. Companies are happy to give steep discounts for their software to universities because it doesn't cost them anything, and it exposes their software to the next generation of potential customers. But they don't want to donate support, because that actually costs them money.
I wrote a script to scrape the reservations site for Yosemite and email if something was available. Had this running on one of my servers while I was trying to get a camping reservation when it was mostly full, worked wonderfully.
Agree 100%. The only reason not to go with Wordpress would be if you're planning on doing development yourself and don't know PHP. But then if you're writing your own site you probably don't want a CMS.

are you stupid?
or just an asshole?
Thanks. From what I can tell it doesn't appear py.test can specify which fixtures to use or not use directly on the command line. However, it does appear it can be directed to to a per-invocation conftest.py file via the -c param. This could be used to have one marked autouse, and one not. Seems messy though. The only other things I can see is subclass TestClass but I'm not really a giant fan of that, or monkeypatch the func out when I dont' want it run. None of these seem graceful. Thanks for your advice though, appreciated. Gave me something to chew on. 
One of my favorite uses for a decorator is [implementing the retry pattern](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn589788.aspx). Makes it super easy to increase the reliability of a client in a predictable and maintainable way. But, OMG is [the Retrying library a shit-ton of code](https://github.com/rholder/retrying/blob/master/retrying.py) where only a fart-pound is needed. This is ~250 SLOC where I've implemented something similar in 1/5 as much code. This may be one of those cases where [you're carrying around the world's biggest Swiss Army Knife](http://partsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Worlds_largest_Swiss_Army_knife_wenger_giant_knife.jpg) just for a pair of scissors and a file.
Very cool! Lots of anonymous functions here, I see you like those. You should check out the functools module for some more fun stuff. Hey I learned python first and will need to switch to java for other jobs. Maybe we can train each other. What brings you to use python now? Work or just for fun?
Why not Java or Go or Perl or Elixir or Smalltalk or Haskell or Ruby? :) 
ah you are right i didn't even double check the last function on my response
no u
u mad bro?
it's greyed-out for me, so I couldn't click on the buttons. How do I enable them?
Is your print(total) supposed to stand in the for loop?
no i was just using that to single some problems out.
Your indentation is off. Made some modifications and cleaned it up a bit, try this: import re import math while True: input_text = "if you want to find the check digt then enter a 7 digit code " \ "and if you want to find the validity enter an eight digit code" gtin = input(input_text) if not re.search ('[0-9]+',gtin) or len(gtin) not in (7,8): print("ERROR") continue total = 0 checkdigit = 0 for pos, x in enumerate(gtin[:8]): digit=int(x) if pos % 2 == 0: digit = digit*3 total += digit if total % 10 != 0: roundup = int(math.ceil(float(total)/10.0))*10 checkdigit = roundup - total print("Your check digit is...", checkdigit)
works perfectly thankyou
I made a small change just now, a bug popped up in afterthought. If the user enters all 8 digits, the total was being calculated from all digits, so I changed it to only run through the first 7 here: for pos, x in enumerate(gtin[:8]):
Overloaded operators are one of the worst anti-patterns that folks use to rail against C++. What are you planning to do here?
Looking forward to the first NSFW result!
I think he means that Github handles the re-rendering of Jekyll pages, which doesn't occur with other static site generators. https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-pages-and-jekyll/#jekylls-build-process
Are the bindings still maintained? Last release seems to be from 2011, according to the pycairo website.
It is based on open source cpython, numpy, scipy, etc. We upstream all the changes we can, but some changes are specific to our environment and not useful to upstream. MKL is not open soruce.
Are you using windows or Linux? On windows, it will load a copy. In Linux, as long as you don't make any changes, it will load the original. However, if you make any changes it will need to make a copy. That is the whole point of multiprocessing: each process has its own set of memory. Processes do not have direct access to the memory of other processes. Linux is smarter about this than windows as long as you don't make any changes to the memory, but it still has to follow the rules of processes once you make changes. What you can do is split your data set into chunks, one for each process. Then each process only needs a copy of the chunk it is going to work with. Or you can use a library like dask that handles this for you.
The concern isn't with the data that I'm processing but the data that I'm processing it against. I'm doing text processing with NLTK. It'd be prohibitive to have to load the corpuses into memory multiple times. It sounds like in this case it's up to how NLTK behaves under the hood. Looks like I'm going to have to switch to java...
pgi is a different thing BTW
Nope. Not without using some 3rd party stuff. Django has always been a little late to the party. But support is awesome and backwards support is great, so personally I don't mind at all:)
&gt;Not without using some 3rd party stuff Isn't "channels" a 3rd party stuff? It's not part of the core django project, if I understand correctly
This is a really interesting and unique idea! :) Any plans on making the source code public, or you would rather not? 
Cool!
Will be this summer
Python threads are subject to the global interpreter lock and are not truly concurrent. They won't solve my problem.
I like Plone a lot. Great security and lots of features. There are enough add-ons to get you started but you will quickly find a need for a whole lot more. If you are wanting a specific look and feel. You can code addons yourself. In the past that was difficult due to the Zope infrastructure. But it has improved. Out of the box Plone is faster than Wordpress. A simple static page driven cms that uses python is Lektor. Pretty cool tool. 
Matplotlib is good and easy for static renderings. Example http://matplotlib.org/examples/api/bbox_intersect.html I've never done animations with it. It can be done, but I don't know how easy it is, or how smooth the result is.
Reading the actual actual article turns out to be really useful. For instance I found this. &gt; The plan is to roll Channels into Django for the 1.10 release, due out some time this summer. So, no, you do not understand correctly.
Uhm... What exactly are you trying to do? There are many issues with the snippet you just posted, but I think this is what you are trying to do? if input("Please enter a letter:") == 'd': room = 0 # ? 
so... The game is a puzzle-based, text-graphic, top-down dungeon crawler (Mouthful) that goes through rooms in a grid system (0-0 being the first room you can enter.) that uses input from the W A S D keys to move, as well as typed commands for special actions. I coded a bit with IDLE about two years back, and have now forgotten everything. You collect 3 keys and open the final door to win the game. My base code so far is: Key1=False Key2=False Key3=False Dagger_hand=True Dagger_backpack=False Sword_hand=False Sword_backpack=False Hp=0 H=100 WinGame=False Killenemy1=False Killenemy2=False Killenemy3=False Room="outside" while(WinGame==False): if (Room=="outside"): print("Health:") print(H) print("Health Potions:") print(Hp) print(" ######___") print(" |### | ") print(" |# | ") print(" X _ | ") print(" |#### | ") print(" |########_| ") print("You find yourself outside an old house. The door is open,") print("but you can barely see anything.") print("") print(" 'use the W A S D keys to") print(" move around. commands will") print(" be conveyd through text.'") input("") if ( input==("d")): Room=="0-0" if (Room=="0-0"): print *ect...* 
This is not a forum for people to do your homework. /r/learnpython
oh. OK thanks!
 input("") what are you trying to do here? The function input returns what is typed. As the top response by mr_dude states, you need to assign it to a variable: user_input = input("") Next you write: if ( input==("d")): Room=="0-0" input, by itself, is a bound method. Type input at the python prompt and hit return to see this. The code should be: if user_input == 'd': room = "0-0" Note the room assignment uses =, not ==. == is for testing equality, and = assigns. room == "0-0" is a conditional with the value False. You do nothing with it, so the result is just discarded. Also, I made your code Pythonic. Spaces between operators, no extra parenthesis, lower case variable names. As another person suggested, try the learnpython subreddit; it is intended for these types of questions. 
I had no idea that without a licence you limit what people can legally do with your project. That sucks https://help.github.com/articles/open-source-licensing/ And here I thought it was silly to add one for non commerial repositories 
Did you write this? Can I hug you? There are so many crap matplotlib tutorials out there on the internet that do not cover a lot of the graphing terminology used, this is great!
Can you do a simple test to see if it'll work? Or is the setup too huge? Honestly unless you're using a machine with tons of cpu cores you'd be better off writing it single threaded and profiling it, then converting the hot spots to c. From there if you have parts that are paralyzable you'd get much better results from the gpu.
It validates the requirements of the package before executing it. Validation always takes much longer.
Maybe, but in my hypothetical minimal example there were no requirements, both were basically: setup( name=... version=... scripts=[...] ) a 150ms startup delay for hello world is pretty unacceptable if that is common simply for the deployment technique, if this is actually common in setuptools then I cannot believe this isn't mentioned by all the people that endorse it. 150ms is humongeous in plenty of contexts, it means that whatever tool you make with it can never be used inside a shell script, be used to generate command line completion where such a delay is highly frustrating amongst other things, if this is normal and not part of some malconfiguration on my system this should be mentioned in every single piece of literature that talks about setuptools. 
The two USB2 cameras are standard directshow or USB video class controllable. They will work on most platforms I would imagine. We are exploring the potential application for mobile computing and wanted to ensure OpenCV would operate on the available hardware. First application will be to mount the cameras on my son's raspberry pi powered two wheeled robot! BTW what type of big sandwiches do you prefer :-) 
The official matplotlib tutorial/ documentation (... / API) is absolute gash.
First "small-world-esq" image from one of the 2 cameras. This is with a higher quality 220 degree lens. Notes: * Taken with a very rough focus * White balance not set correctly * Image cropping not perfect. This lens produces full image circle that fills about 85% of the 5MP senor vertical height, so there will be enough pixels at the edges to ensure the entire FOV is captured. * image resolution reduced to ~ 800 x 800 http://imgur.com/WGSWn47
I believe Allegro can do that. As a bonus its well documented, easy to learn and fast.
I prefer to use distutils when possible. Speed is one of the reasons. I work a lot with C extensions and gcc is way faster than setuptools which ridiculously dominates build time.
Looks like a really cool project. What does VPS stand for?
thanks
Virtual private server.
Would decomposition of the data among child processes using mpi4py or similar work? Another option would be concurrent access using mpi4py and h5py, see [here](http://docs.h5py.org/en/latest/mpi.html). I haven't used multiprocessing, have used mpi4py. There's a fair bit of boilerplate. However, I'd also echo /u/corm and suggest seeing how bad it is first. Premature optimisation is...something to be cautious about.
maybe to do a path library or something or maybe to implement division as an actual division, like, dividing a time period don't need to 1v1 everyone who wants to use two understores in a row
wow, that's awesome!
Cool project, but this really confirms that I *hate* Vine. Good work, though!
The BEST [tutorial](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-4-Matplotlib.ipynb), you can thank me later ;-). Not until I found out about the OOP style api, did I start enjoying MATPLOTLIB again. I just hated the MATLAB style api.
You can share memory between multiprocessing processes with memmap. Children are forks of the parent so they can access the same memory. 
it is gross, you should use the OO API
/r/learnpython
Yeah, I noticed that later.
it worked i unpacked one of the rpa files then repacked it right away with out changing a thing

Not to be a naysayer, but isn't Django and the rest of python web dying in the face of node and golang? For example, PyCon only has 2 Django talks and 1 flask talk. Nothing for Tornado. That's why we do our web with node and business logic with python. Our CTO observed a near complete lack of interest at PyCon by the python community in Python web. Didn't want to bet on a losing horse. Speaking of work, can't wait to go to SciPy this year! :)
Web has always been underrepresented at PyCon. But that's why there is djangocon (both us and eu) who both continue to grow each year.
I'd never choose node over Python for a web project. Ever b
This is excellent work, and the best thing is that you took the time to help other people by documenting your steps. You have a bright future ahead of you and you're on the right track üëç
And actually we have ggplot on Python now, just pip install ggplot~ https://github.com/yhat/ggplot
So this is a websocker handler/server with celery-like solution? You need to have a wsgi server + "asgi" server. I think I did something like this in channelstream 4 years ago, it was also implemented by shaveet or hookbox.
I have my own company, baroquesoftware.com. I work a lot on stuff like JIT, garbage collection, random bug fixing. Also a lot on pypy admin and pypy-related consulting
I don't know why it's taking 2 seconds to load. You are doing something seriously wrong. Unless you're talking about the boot up time of the machine or vm, then 2 seconds is really good. 
Django has its own cons? https://djangocon.eu/
Is there a webframework for Node or golang as mature as Django? I occasionally try to assemble the parts for something like it on Node but you get tired of trawling npm and Github for mixed-quality micro modules.
Looks like active development has stopped?
One of the reasons for the pylab API was to make the plotting terse. And it is. If you use sensible styles in rcfile, they even look good. Sure you can make 100 line plots if you want, but usually this suggests you haven't used the styling infrastructure - like using inline styles vs css. 
Is your analysis from the point of view of the developer of open source and/or proprietary software, or is it from the point of view of developers using that software? Note also that for open source, developers are often both users and developers of the software. Your example about Darwin clearly point to my first case, but I am not sure the start of your comment is about my first case. can you clarify?
If you load your data in memory BEFORE forking new processes they will share the same memory pages containing your data set. The overall memory consumption will increase as your subprocesses allocate memory for their own use and modify the shared memory pages. This isn't a Python behaviour, it is the general memory management of the Linux kernel. If your starting data set is used read-only by your working subprocesses, you should be fine using multiprocessing.
thank you!
there's no limit to the type of subreddit so go ahead!
Convenience really since they're all one-line scripts. Plus it's more "Pythonic", I think
Thanks!
Thanks! I think lambdas are great for little one-line mini-functions like the ones in the code.
Downvoting because this is super basic and would probably be better suited for /r/learnpython.
&gt;Is your analysis from the point of view of the developer of open source and/or proprietary software, or is it from the point of view of developers using that software? I base my analysis from historic tendencies of different niches/categories of software, not even a particular product, world not developers; I am in general trying to be out if personal of POV here, because it makes defending it much more complicated. May Darwin being is a result of niche of software Dedicated to Operating Systems core development. Mac OS X becoming free is a result of Apple being unable to justify/'motivate to pay' it's price to it's customers. Both are outlining a tendency to a "cheaper" accessibility(From Payed to Free, from Closed Source to Open Source). I would say I do not make any distinction in that, but it works both ways. I am not sure I made it particularly clear, but I can try to make my argument more, I guess, structured. Every software niche has this factors and attributes: * it Needs Resources(**NR**), aka human hours to develop(and everything goes around that) * It has Stages of Development(**SD**): early when it's mostly uncharted, to late stage when most ideas have already been implemented somewhere * Popularity(**P**), which is from low to high. **NR** is easier to satisfy proportionally to **SD** and **P**. With growth of **SD** it is also harder to justify proprietary investments(like buying a new version), because customer is satisfied already, which brings prices down. Rise in **P** drives up competition which again, drives prices down. Also because **SD** ideas can be copied and mimicked which drives **NR** down. At late stage from economical point of view it's better to open the code and earn money on support. Which happened with Unix. And is model of most Open projects.
I agree. Pyramid + SQLAlchemy blows Django out of the water completely. I don't know why it's not more popular.
Pretty much. :-(
Haha thanks. Yeah when I was learning matplotlib, I was so confused and frustrated when I saw examples in MATLAB style and then come across OOP style examples. The official docs should have pointed this out from the beginning.
What happens if you put blocking code into your application - like a query to db other than postgresql? There is a reason why this is architectured this way. &gt; "Django channels work across a network and allow producers and consumers to run transparently across many dynos and/or machines. " Looks pretty much to me to what I described - nothing wrong with this approach ofcourse.
gevent_socketio in its current release on pypi is broken.
Thanks. You are clearly speaking from the point of view of those developing the open source or proprietary software, because those are the ones incurring NR costs. Users do not care about NR, they care about their own costs in using it. These may not be related at all to NR.
Um, are you the person behind bokeh? Or just its biggest reddit fan?
Well, in most startups, investors are paying for NR, not customers ;)
I agree with that, but all angling comes to customers at the end. If customer does not receive project he likes he will not pay for it. Basically customer is the final investor. So I agree with your point, but I think the discussion is mostly in semantics as of now.
It might sound *hyperbolic*, but that ipynb changed my life. ...*hyperbolic*. Get it? Because we're talking about plotting curves? I'll show myself out.
If someone could write a tutorial on how to make pandas not throw a warning about "making changes to a copy" every last time I want to assign anything to anything else, I would be so happy.
My gut says that it* won't work, but I think all you can do is experiment. My reasoning that it won't work is that even if you're only reading (i.e. not modifying) python objects, you'll still be incrementing/decrementing reference counts. I'm fairly certain that for most (all?) built-in python objects, the reference counts are stored contiguously in memory with the data itself. This would mean that even looking at the python objects would cause the memory pages to be written and hence copied into your subprocess. I could be wrong (in fact I'm probably wrong about at least _something_ in my explanation), but I definitely think all you can do is experiment. *By "it" I mean loading in the data and then creating subprocesses all using the same data. Some people mention using shared memory, but I'm not sure how you'd make that work. I'm pretty sure that the incrementing/decrementing of the reference counts is very thread-unsafe in the cpython runtime. This would mean that you would have to throw locks around the shared memory region even when just reading (i.e. two processes access and object, but they only manage to increment the references once, but they do manage to decrement it twice...which could then cause the object to be garbage-collected). I think the best thing to do is to probably just have entirely separate processes running in parallel if possible. I.e. if it takes 1gb of memory to run and you have 8gbs of memory, create subprocesses that each load the same data into memory and then have a master process which dispatches computations to them in a round-robin style or something. Regardless, I hope my pessimism is misplaced. If you get it to work in a cool way make sure to update the thread. Good luck!
I'm a bit late to commenting, but this is a great ORM. I personally love the active record pattern, and I'm glad someone made it accessible to Python. SQLalchemy and Pony are both datamapper frameworks - yes there's sqlsoup for SQLalchemy, but it's not very nice to use - so in my opinion, this was desperately needed. I've been using Orator for a while now, and it is part of a soon-to-be production system. Thanks a lot for this!
Actually, both of these tutorials are fantastic and just helped me a ton. Thanks!
There's no opencv py34 package file http://anaconda.org/memex/opencv/files
This is literally like blaming SQL for allowing injections through handcrafted queries. Template engines accept parameters for a reason.
I didn't read the article and I'm at work ATM, sorry for asking stupid questions but thank you for the answers
And if you want some cleaner code rather than the hot mess which is the Python Lambda function - check out: https://github.com/anjishnu/ask-alexa-pykit 
I think we're misunderstanding each other. You said "You need to have a WSGI server + ASGI server". You do not: your ASGI server replaces the requirement for a WSGI server. In a production channels deployment you have (at least) three separate processes: - at least 1 ASGI server (probably the reference implementation, [daphne](https://github.com/andrewgodwin/daphne)). - at least 1 channel layer (in the usual case, Redis) - at least 1 application server (Django) You do *not* have a WSGI server, though: the ASGI server *also* serves HTTP and places HTTP requests into the channel layer, just as it does for websockets. There is no need for a WSGI server in this model.
This is a great start on Python. I have lots of constructive feedback for you. :) Read [this](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). None of the `lambda`s are necessary. Each of them is called only once. All they add is indirection; I think you'd do better to inline the code and add comments if it's not clear what's going on. Instead of calling `setBackground` at the bottom of the module, check for `__main__`: if __name__ == '__main__': set_background() By doing that, if you invoke the module directly (either with `python module_name.py` or `python -m package.module`), it will work as it does now but it will also be importable _without_ executing the code at import time. Don't `break` inside the `try` branch. Use `else` instead. Though the `break` should obviously never fail, this conceptually breaks the code into _smallest thing that can fail_, _thing to do if it fails_, and _thing to do when it succeeds_. try: text = getText(url) except urllib.error.HTTPError as err: time.sleep(5) else: break Look at [`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) and make it more configurable. Right now, it forces the download directory to `c:\redditimages`.
thx... I managed to get it from another source though :)... I didn't know how to check the available python version
And it has transparent RPC and PUB/SUB, and it doesn't need redis (it's in Python), and it has a security layer, and it allows both threads and asyncio, and it has bridge for HTTP, and it works with also with C#, Java, JS (node and browser) and PHP...
try python 3.5
Hehe, py-spin sounds really fun.
The regular WX, GTK or Qt drawing APIs will do this. Just use whichever is your preferred toolkit. Not sure about Tkinter though. Don't use Tkinter.
i just had an issue installing some things with conda and some things with pip through conda. some things wouldn't compile right. to be honest the thing that's getting me a little annoyed is that if i want to install tweepy, for example, the pypi channel on conda is an entire version behind 2.0 v 3.0. there's some person who uploaded v 3.0 but it's just a random person. the reality is that i have no idea what i'm downloading. that seems really unsafe. i mean wouldn't it be possible to just build a pipline that goes and grabs things from pypi and keeps them up to date on a secure channel on conda? have continuum just not gotten around to this? do they not want that? just trying to understand why i have to choose between getting the version i need or downloading unknown software. or using pip within conda (which seems to not work right sometimes). it seems like conda isn't really a replacement for pip then, it kind of seems to create its own set of different issues? at a pretty basic level a package manager w/o access to the packages people publish is kind of ... dysfunctional. just trying to get some context here.
Please vote for this ticket https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-14330. We'll consider this for the next release.
It really works as magic
What does df.columns give you?
Can you just assign to a new variable directly without the copy first or would this just be assigning a view of the tb dataframe into messy? messy = tb.drop('total', axis=1) 
This would create a copy indeed, that you can slice after. But if you work on the slice intensively, then it is better to copy the slide for performance reasons (well, that i my gut feeling, I should benchmark to be sure).
Hi! Congrats on the new version! Is hug [Swagger](http://swagger.io)-friendly? In other words, can I generate a Swagger file from hug code? Thanks!
Got it. Thanks!
What do you have so far?
Because SQLAlchemy has a learning curve when you couple it with Alembic. Django has all of ORM and auto migrations build into the same command that starts the server.
That site could really use a proofreader.
yeah i understand that conda is really this platform safe build tool. that's what conda-forge is about. they are using some continuous integration platforms to put packages onto their channel and have builds for linux, osx, and windows for packages. safe, reliable, transparent. i guess i've just grown used to the extreme convenience in other package managers. continuum is really advertising it as an alternative to pip. if they want more people to use it they could do a better job of explaining what you explained. it would be a less painful learning curve. i was checking out your repo last night. i really appreciate this, cleared up a lot of my confusion.
Hi /u/ppinette, I totally agree! I would love a proof reader! Unfortunately, this being open-source, and with my self proof-reading skill lacking, there are really only two options: 1) users like you can be kind enough to give examples and I'll update 2) you could contribute! https://github.com/timothycrosley/hug/tree/develop/documentation You'll get a free t-shirt and I'll be forever grateful. Not to mention all the people who no longer see the typos and grammatical errors. Almost all of the site content is built from here: https://github.com/timothycrosley/hug/tree/develop/documentation or in the .md files in the root of the repo. Thank! ~Timothy
Yay! I really appreciate it! The only other areas where documentation live is here: https://github.com/timothycrosley/hug_website/blob/develop/hug_website/app.py#L106 for the home page and quickstart and https://github.com/timothycrosley/hug_website/blob/develop/hug_website/views/latest.shpaml for the lastest version (2.0.0) information. 
/r/learnpython
Thanks! I've been playing with hug just today, and now that you have this shiny new version released, I'm even more interested.
That code isn't doing the same thing as the snippet above. The important part that you're missing is here: messy = tb[tb['year'] == 2000] This generates a (filtered) view of the original dataframe.
Thanks! The other replies told me why it happens, which everyone already knows. Yours told me how to get rid of it, which is far more useful. :-)
I am 100% sure that it is not in JSON or XML. This is part of a web scraper

Make sure to read their sidebar rules there before posting, notably this one: "Posting homework assignments is not prohibited if you show that you tried to solve it yourself." If your question is about homework, show them that you've tried to solve your problem in your post and you should get all the help you need. For anything else, the reason you are seeing this message is still that you will likely get a better answer there! Warm Regards, and best of luck with Python!
Oh my... I'm so bad. ;-; plz forgive me haha. Thank you again! :D
Hi, I'm not sure what you mean by a homework-style question. This is not a learning python question -- I've used python for several years now and have authored several large pieces of software in it. I'm already looked around and found several PDF libaries in python but have still found them to be wanting so I am hoping that someone has maybe found something I missed. Is this not the right place for that kind of question? If not then what kinds of questions should be posted here? Myabe I missed it but the sidebar rules just say "homework-style" and this does not seem like a homework level question. 
Nevermind I looked at the sticky thread and though I don't really get why this kind of question should go to learnpython I guess thems the rules.
Roughly translated pages are always just slightly more hard to understand than I wish they were. :) It's just something about the grammar and word use that throw a curveball at my brain when I'm trying to understand what's going on.
Thank you for your explanation. 
&gt;extreamly
In a nod to a past article here... when are we going to get Python graphing *for humans* (tm)?
Came here to recommend this. This is more reliable than loading and forking, because in the latter strategy, you can easily COW pages with your data by changing something else in the page. If each process gets a clean memmap region, none of them will break the sharing.
I love you, you are my favorite person, have my children
The warnings are here to help you write more efficient code as I tried to explain. 
As far a I know there isn't an AI that can currently do this, even Watson knows all the rules before hand be it syntax or physics they stay the same. Four grand feels really low for what is being asked the prestige of winning has to be worth a good amount. Have these guys done challenges before? Anyone know? Add a py3 and I might not totally be put off by the low amount assuming the challenge is well known. An obscure win for what will amount to less than minimum wage is not the most exciting prospect. The website also doesn't specify, the winner (all participants?) is(are) signing their bot over to DCA I would assume?
 &lt;link href="http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:100|Roboto+Slab" rel="sytlesheet" type="text/css" /&gt; Spot the typo
That is what I mean, prize seems low and DCA looks tiny from their office building in Moscow (which they clearly just rent space in). To slave away on this, walk with 4 grand and then have no one ever hear about it would kinda suck.
 fi = lambda i: 1 if i % 2 else 3 total = sum(int(GTIN[i]) * fi(i) for i in range(7))
Fixed. Thank you! I had the fonts installed locally so I didn't even notice when the link was wrong. Def my bad.
This is going to be hard. The need for In browser Python is sporadic at best, and not very many people will have tested out all these options. But, from my understanding Pyjs is the most solid framework in the bunch, however its mostly a HTML-GUI framework. It would be valuable if someone, like you, went through these frameworks are gave a good comparison. You are certainly not the only that that is curious about this.
&gt; It would be valuable if someone, like you, went through these frameworks are gave a good comparison. Agreed, but I need a better idea of what I should be comparing between them. Ideally hard metrics, or some kind of test cases. 
It's not a bad idea. It would be valuable to know if any of those frameworks have a significant drop in speed compared to any other. But generally speaking anyone working on one of these is not going to be too concerned with speed. I think a feature comparison would be the most useful, and perhaps not as time consuming. 
Yeah I thought so. Thank you bot.
I created a .py file which would run about 12 different separate .py pandas files. 1) download the new data from the ftp 2) check if two critical files existed on my hard drive before proceeding 3) process each of the data from the previous day 4) create some customised files (basically merging about 7 of the files together into an awesome file) 5) archive the data (.bz2) and copy it to the shared folder for end-users to access if needed 6) email notifications that everything has been updated Just last week I added a step to write a .tde file (for Tableau). I move the new .tde and replace the old one in a dummy folder, then I use ZipFile to zip the folder again. Then I rename the .zip file to .twbx so Tableau can open it. (This stuff used to be done manually in Excel and it would literally take me the full 8 hour shift every day, now it is all done before I even get to the office which is one of the coolest things that I can imagine. There is so much potential to automate manual reporting. I am excited)
Is there a better way (on windows) to schedule tasks? 
I use selenium to go to an Oracle BI tool webpage. From there I need to login (selenium), click drop downs (selenium), type in some fields for filters (selenium) and download the data/export (selenium). I have it running to get daily data and this one weekly report. It has worked with no issues and certainly saves me time. I've seen it run before, it literally opens up Chrome and does all of this stuff, but I have it run while I am at home sleeping.
You *can* throw colours on the screen and have a website. Relatively attractive, maybe not.
I did benchmark and I was right. Copying after slicing does improves performance. See https://gist.github.com/jfpuget/873d3cbe823fef52a4ce
Very nice
FYI, treating windows users (7-64, 2.7), like lower class citizens does NOT make anyone want to upgrade. Thanks for your condescending attitude...no update for shit software.
Nice mindmap. OT: If you like mindmaps I recommand: http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page
Direct link to the git version on the web [http://coodict.github.io/python3-in-one-pic/](http://coodict.github.io/python3-in-one-pic/)
Here's a tip I found useful; read everything you write from the end of the sentence to the begin. That way you break through your own expectations of what should be there and you read what is actually there. Looks cool, I'll definitely have a look
Duke's [reference](http://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663/index.html) on computational statistics is very comprehensive also.
Hey, first of all RapydScript has its own website: http://www.rapydscript.com/ And I'd like to know this: I'd like to know at a glance if it's a real-python to the browser or a javascript transpiler (RapydScript), if so what is the available tooling (gulp, grunt, editor plugins ?) Do they use python modules, do they have their own, do they rely on JS modules ? And how do we integrate with a popular JS framework, like Angular ?
So how would you call the .exe to run on bootup?
That's not really Python specific. You can Google it. 
print(line, end="") is python3 try print(line), 
I bet you could fix it by using virtualenv too. 
 inFile = open("text.txt", "r") line = inFile.readline() while(line): print(line), line = inFile.readline()
However, i would probably do it like this in python2: with open('text.txt','r') as f: for line in f.readlines(): print line,
Almost sounds like they want easy labor.
Ah it's Python 3 it works in!
It's rarely used more than a gig of ram for me, and I can't say the same about chrome with 6 tabs open (YouTube, Gmail, some random documentation pages). The fact it's written in Java should not matter. It looks like any other application from the user perspective. And the time it saves you in coding software and refactoring, analyzing code and finding bugs far outweighs any micro lag that might occur compared with a small editor like sublime text. 
I wouldn't encourage people to use print like a function in python2. It only works as expected when you have a single "argument". When you try to use a second argument in the parenthesis, it becomes more clear that something is not right. print("one", "two") &gt;&gt;&gt; ('one', 'two') ~~It creates a tuple and that is used as a single argument for the print keyword. It just happens that the string representation of a tuple with a length of one is the value in the tuple.~~ Edit: See reply below, it is not making a tuple.
Browser cookies? 
&gt; representation of a tuple with a length of one is the value in the tuple That is not correct. &gt;&gt;&gt; print("one",) ('one',) &gt;&gt;&gt; type(("one")) &lt;type 'str'&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; type(("one",)) &lt;type 'tuple'&gt; When you do print("one"), you are not creating a 1-tuple, that is a string with a redundant parenthesis around it.
I'm just saying it sounds like it. Not making any assumptions, here.
It's using the client ID and secret that I registered for with Imgur's API.
Great tutorial, thanks. In order to run it in Jupyter, one needs to avoid using %matplotlib inline Indeed, the animation do not show. Instead, use %matplotlib nbagg And the animations will show. *edit* formated code.
Not to be rude but I really don't understand what you're saying. Maybe try to explain it with some examples, like what exactly do I have to type into a command line or anywhere else?
So foes that allow you to view what everyone has posted on imgur since it's being done through your imgur account?
No, I'm not able to view images that other people upload. The method I'm using from the Imgur API is upload_from_path() which has the parameter anon=True. This means all of the images are being uploaded anonymously. I'm actually not totally clear if the credentials I've included in the program are even necessary - maybe someone who knows more could speak to this.
Sweet! I almost didn't look at this post, but thought...well maybe...and here it is!
What a lot of folks seem to suggest as an alternative is writing a service. I haven't tried that yet so I can't say if that's better or not. The issues I had with the task scheduler was that it seemed unreliable. During a pre-restart, when a box box pops up saying you need to restart to apply updates, the tasks seemed to die. After a restart the tasks would run but also seemed to die sporadically. We had the tasks write to log files so we could check on things and there were bizarre gaps and all sort of weird problems. We seem to have found the right combination of triggers and task setting to make it consistent now though and perhaps we were the problem and not Windows task scheduler. It's no CRON that's for sure. 
It's not much, but glad to see it might see some use :) Ask if there's anything. I know getting your own client id/secret is a bit of a hassle, but including mine in the source appearantly isn't a good idea: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/imgur/dTRL-I2q8YQ/dyxXBidKE5oJ
Where is the repo?
Congratulations on the release! Really great to see marshmallow, integration, too. I would be glad to help out where I can.
Thanks for correcting me. However the point remains, using the print keyword like a function in python 2 can cause confusion when people don't understand what is actually happening.
Thanks for sharing the book! Wanted to get into Python networking in relation to hacking methodologies. I believe this will be a great resource!
The package [pywapi](https://launchpad.net/python-weather-api) may be of help to you - I used it to create a dynamic scrolling feed of weather in my area. It gathers text-based weather data and returns it in the form of [dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#typesmapping). Best of luck!!
It's a shame that they didn't just do this to *all* of Python 3. Then we wouldn't have the gratuitous incompatibilities -- you just import the language you want, and the meaning of the source file would be clear and unambiguous.
That is excellent advice. I really appreciate it :). I can't tell you how many times I've re-read and re-read text to be shown dozens of mistakes, for spelling etc that I know by heart but for some reason my mind fills in the blanks when I re-read.
If you are comfortable with web server frameworks you could use a browser for your GUI.
One option is to modify the default seaborn style by passing a dictionary to seaborn.set_style(). See "Overriding elements of the seaborn styles" at this link: https://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/tutorial/aesthetics.html I think you'll want to modify 'axes.facecolor' 
Yup soundcloud has a [python API wrapper](https://github.com/soundcloud/soundcloud-python), and I can see things like follower count are returned from the `/users` endpoint and play count from the `/tracks` endpoint, no problems there. No experience updating a google sheet but a cursory search shows there are also [python libs](https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=google+sheets+api+python) for this. Very doable project there.
Oh, yea, I've seen that I can modify the styles directly. I'll do that if I have to, but I'm hoping to find a good, existing dark style to use. I can recognize when a style looks better than "lazy hacker dark", but I'm not especially good at defining color themes myself.
Probably not the answer you're looking for, but pyqtgraph uses a dark theme by default which looks pretty good, imho.
I would literally start here https://github.com/soundcloud/soundcloud-python go through the most basic of functionality and their examples and get it outputting certain data, once you've established you can get the data you want from the API think about your logic flow and how you are going to target the users/tracks you want to iterate through and get chunks of data, then you can start working on getting it to google sheets
You could probably outsource it to china for 1/5 of the pay, just make sure he doesn't VPN directly to you.
To save everyone the trouble of finding it on their webpage: it requires [Python 2.7](http://blackboxchallenge.com/information/). 
It has Python written after the name of the authornhe quoted, isnt that enough. ;p
That works fine for statements and builtin functions that exist in one version but not the other. I'm not sure how it would work for types that change semantics. What happens when you pass an instance of one of these types across a module boundary, where each module has its own idea of what the type means?
Why on earth are you still stuck on Python 2.4, this is madness, that version is loooong out of support, you should be on 2.7 or 3.4+, by 2020 you should have dumped Python 2.x all together.
Thanks - I'll try it out.
Ooh, that's good to know regardless. Thanks.
I found this: https://gist.github.com/mwaskom/7be0963cc57f6c89f7b2, and now I wonder if there is something wonky with my setup, because that code produces a figure with a white background for me. Any advice here?
This a great question; good on you for giving a solid description of the problem and your intended approach. Yes, this is definitely possible. Both [Google Apps](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/) and [SoundCloud](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/guide) have REST APIs that you can access from a Python program.
Look into [scapy](http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/). 
In the second example, the name "a" is already defined and pointing to the function (because of the def) when you call bind_inner_func. With the decorator, the name isn't defined until after the decorator returns, so the references to 'a' are undefined. They would be effectively equivalent if you didn't refer to the name of the function ("a") inside itself.
Would be **very** useful if you could explain what to do rather than reinstall os from scratch. Python comes pre-installed and pip was dl'ed via sudo apt-get. So there is no way anything would change without additional info. It may not be the fastest way but would rather fix it as is than re-install. (Esp since most sites will not mess with it and just tell people to sudo pip, eg stack-overflow/askUbuntu) 
yeah i converted it from .py to .exe so more people can run it easier. using py2exe
This is probably part of the cause too. I exported my path from a lab machine and initially didn't change the python-paths while installing. So long as the path includes all of pip and site/dist packages I should be good right? (Everything works except jupyter notebook) 
how many schmeckles is that?
Ok, that is it. I followed your train of thought, and [PEP 0318](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/#current-implementation-history) says at one place: &gt; &gt; @dec2 &gt; @dec1 &gt; def func(arg1, arg2, ...): &gt; pass &gt; &gt; This is equivalent to: &gt; &gt; def func(arg1, arg2, ...): &gt; pass &gt; func = dec2(dec1(func)) &gt; &gt; **though without the intermediate creation of a variable named func**. Shame. I wonder if there is any meaningful downside to creating that intermediate variable, because I kind of like what I was trying out.
If you're a beginner you'll probably be spending a good deal of time in the REPL (the interactive part of python). May I recommend [IPython](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/overview.html)? It provides a number of real improvements on the default python interpreter, like tab-completion of names, and easy access to help by just typing a `?` after any name or module.
And Python 2 too :) 
Wow...amazed at the many comprehensive resources I have still yet to discover. This is new to me, and "comprehensive" is the right word...I love that it has a [Polyglot section](http://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663/MultiKernel.html)...something usually not found in many other guides.
Yes, what do you have in mind precisely? You will find those function useful: http://pastebin.com/F76mGFq9
Cool cool idea. You could possibly make a tiny passive income based on this, if you maybe put out channels en masse. 
They definitely have Python3 and a unspecified form which is likely python2
If you didn't wanna mutate the globals, you could even recreate the function by using `type(func)`. Funs!
Also check if any IFTTT integrations are usable
What the other posters said is exactly right. Open up python and try making a few hits to the soundcloud python api. But if you get stuck and overwhelmed then I'd suggest just going through python on codeacademy
Cool, clean and easy to read code. I didn't know messing around with the registry would be that simple in python. BTW, have a look at line 17 and 25. You're not closing the registry handle properly, as the function returns and terminates before you get to it. Maybe you should also add a method of uninstalling it aswell. 
[Here is the reference page](https://gspread.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) Just found out, literally while opening this link to check if it was the right one, that you don't even have to use Oauth2. You can login with your Google account and mail. Gl with your project!
Truth. pyqtgraph is excellent, especially for huge datasets. I'd go on and on about the great features it comes with, but perhaps the best feature is the excellent set of examples demonstrating them all.
using a Google Sheet ? why not use a database ?
&gt; Tell me if writing this program is possible... Yes.
"Let's talk about job security..." 
Seems a bit much
Google Sheets does indeed have an API, and there's even a [3rd party client library](https://github.com/burnash/gspread) you could use. On the other hand, it might be easiest to simply output the data in CSV format (using Python's [CSV](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/csv.html) module) and import that into Google Sheets.
neither can &lt;div&gt;s... the big thing is that it's awkward to call JS inside/outside the frame.

Are you familiar with databasing? would love any thoughts!
YouTube is also an *excellent* source for Python tutorials, especially for the more complicated parts like classes and such (classes might be easy, I'm also a not quite absolute but very very beginner Python programmer)

How does that make it relevant? It's a quote that has nothing to do with Python. 
lol
Just a side note: Email addresses *can* contain uppercase letters and most of your *bad* characters. Your check is too strict.
First of all learn to format your code properly date_1 = datetime(1989, 8, 7, 20, 10) # Dec 5 1990 5:20 am date_2 = datetime(1990, 12, 5, 5, 20) #This will find the difference between the two dates difference = relativedelta.relativedelta(date_2, date_1) years = difference.years months = difference.months days = difference.days hours = difference.hours minutes = difference.minutes print "Difference is %s year, %s months, %s days, %s hours, %s minutes " %(years, months, days, hours, minutes) For user input, check this tutorial: http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/handsonHtml/io.html The first example there shows you how to use the `input` function and capture the string the user supplies. Do this a number of times to get each of the pieces of information you want from the user. Then convert them to a datetime using the `datetime` function as you have done in your first two statements, then use the `(datetime1 - datetime2).total_seconds()` method you have discovered to find out the difference between the two dates in seconds. I'm not going to give you the answer directly, but you should be able to put it together easily enough with this help.
Let me be clear, a single language code base would be an absolute dream. But I think we all need to resign ourselves to the fact that that is just not going to happen. You can limit the amount of Javascript you work with, but you can never eliminate it. Even with these Python-in-browser solutions, you are either translating to JS, which means you will need to error check and and maybe even do some tweaks in JS, or you are interpreting from JS, which means you need to set the page up with JS first. The desire for a one language stack is also why node.js is so popular, despite the irksome function-in-function-in-function nonsense it is to work with JS, some people are desperate enough to want to take the front end language to the back end with them. 
Sure. In an ideal world.
Hi, could you help me review that PR? I'm not good at it :-)
Could you share some examples of what you find 'goofy' and 'strange'?
The onus is on you to make the effort to learn the language and decide if it's worth using or not. Asking others to "convince you" is a waste of your own time and theirs. Ours is a large active community that derives a lot of value from using this language. That should be enough to convince you to try.
https://xkcd.com/353/ Just take the code academy course and it'll get you up to speed on the syntax. The philosophy is it takes all of the crap about C that 99% of the people don't need to know or worry about and throw it out. Going back to C (for arduino / embedded) is a PITA because I'll forget a semi-colon here or there. Or the brackets won't be right. It's stuff that trips up new time coders and having not done it for a long time I honestly don't miss it.

Because language syntax should be at the bottom of the list when it comes to evaluating a languages usefulness? If you are learning Python it is probably pretty useless feeling. The tooling is worse than Java, it's slow, dynamically typed, and you have to deal with the whole 2-&gt;3 transition b.s. However, once you get comfortable an entirely new upside appears: it looks like pseudocode! Well written Python is very readable, and there are lots of well written libraries to make most imaginable tasks just a few lines. It is a wonderful prototyping language for that reason, and might become your go-to scripting language when you have those problems that are just a little too hairy for bash but too small to pull out the IDE. Problems I've solved recently in &amp;lt; 10 lines of Python: * Pull the JSON from this website and find all the unique values * Write a git commit hook that makes sure all the code in my directory is properly formatted * dump all the messages in this AWS SQS queue into that one 
What is being chained in the chainable example? how much effort would it take to knock up an api, and then use that as a microservice for a front end? Specifically, running a json api (obviously) which ends up having state, and then accessing that api from python with the state preserved. Does it have to be use.HTTP or can it be others? 
I would do the Google sheets first as practice. Setting up a database and learning the ins and outs of that can be changing to some. (Also you won't have the nice GUI of Google sheets). Once you do that you can look into some tutorials on SQLAlchemy (plenty of good ones). And after that you can setup your own website with Flask and share it with the world.
Python has a philosophy that seems to be all its own, this is true. As someone who also spends most of his time in C like languages, C# in my case, I also find Python strange. I do like Python, however. I think the focus in Python is on simplicity and on enforcing good practices. While it can't make everything perfect it certainly tries. These things are why it's considered a good language to start new programmers out on. For example, they remove the brackets that we C style language programmers use to enforce good indention. Really, there is nothing in the world that forces you to use Python but it is a good language to have under your belt. Here is a decent article that you might find interesting: [Python vs C: A Beginner's Guide](https://blog.udemy.com/python-vs-c/)
Uh... your "mitigated" version still has the vulnerability. You need to use a parameterized query to actually mitigate the SQL injection. Maybe you forgot to push? Using `.format()` does not provide any additional safety over using the `%` operator. Also, there is basically no point in validating emails by using a regexp. Your regexp will not allow many valid email addresses to pass through. But even if you could validate emails with a regexps, what would you hope to gain from it? Just because an email address is well-formed, that indicates in no way that there is actually an account associated with it and someone on the receiving end. If you want some sort of safety that the user gave you his/her correct email address, just send a confirmation email with a token. It's the only way to know. If you want to make sure the user didn't mistype their email address, just check if there's a dot and an at-sign in there (and maybe other criteria, if you feel like it), and if not, give the user a warning (not an error) like "please make sure you typed your email address correctly" or just make the user type their email address twice. 
 Is this correct? from datetime import datetime from dateutil import relativedelta print 'welcome to my date difference calculator!' firstyear = input('Enter your first year: ') firstmonth = input('Enter your first month: ') firstday= input('Enter your first day: ') firsthour = input('Enter your hour: ') firstminute = input('Enter your minute: ') secondyear = input('Enter your second year: ') secondmonth = input('Enter your second month: ') secondday = input('Enter your second day: ') secondhour = input('Enter your second hour: ') secondminute = input('Enter your second minute: ') firstdate = datetime(firstyear, firstmonth, firstday, firsthour, firstminute) seconddate = datetime(firstyear, firstmonth, firstday, firsthour, firstminute) difference = relativedelta.relativedelta(seconddate, firstdate) years = difference.years months = difference.months days = difference.days hours = difference.hours minutes = difference.minutes print "The difference between these two days is %s year, %s months, %s days, %s hours, %s minutes " %(years, months, days, hours, minutes) (t- datetime.datetime(years,months,days,hours,minutes)).total_seconds() print "This is the difference in time in seconds:" + t-datetime
&gt; a single-language codebase is always a nice thing, which is what I'm planning with whatever my next web-app Then try http://naga.re or ScalaJS
Also, some other, more minor comments: - you have SQL code and validation in gui.py, which is not a good separation-of-concerns - you mix firstLowerCamelCase and underscore_style, sometimes even in the same identifier names - your "tests" don't really do anything? I'm not sure where you were going with that - you need to do better error-checking, e.g. for your SQL calls (that would've also revealed why your attack appeared to "fail" in the "mitigated" screenshot even though your application is still vulnerable)
I know some people are saying to use sqlite, but I'll go ahead and tell you what I would do. I would install Postgres. Sqlite is ok for learning, but people generally don't use it very seriously. If you're on a Mac, it's pretty easy to install postgres with Homebrew. You will also need pgAdmin, so you can look at the data in a GUI. In your python code, you can use the psycopg library. If you go this route, you'll have some learning ahead of you, but, learning SQL is fun in my opinion.
&gt; Is there an easy to way to get a nice-looking dark style in matplotlib? The easiest (read: laziest) is to just invert everything: E.g: http://i.imgur.com/L0itLaT.png
You sound like much more of a hardware oriented guy, since you mentioned VHDL. If you have some engineering background then I can say that python makes an amazing scientific language. It plays with C very well and is great for controlling hardware, performing calculations, and binding to existing programs. It means that your core functionality can be implemented with C, and the higher level application with a GUI, web access, or whatever can be written with python as a glue between components. The syntax is strange at first, but the biggest differences are swapping braces for indentation and optionally dropping semicolons. You'll have to learn about dynamic typing, but you won't have to use it yourself (and I'd discourage it anyway). 
&gt; But even if you could validate emails with a regexps, what would you hope to gain from it? Just because an email address is well-formed, that indicates in no way that there is actually an account associated with it and someone on the receiving end. While email confirmation is obviously the right way to do it, there are definitely reasons for regex masks on acceptable email addresses (I'm doing it in Jira right now). If you have an application and specific auth backend which you know for sure isn't going to be used by anyone without a domain email and you control that domain and its email system, it's one extra level of security and safety. It means that even if someone with elevated rights in the app goes rogue and invites a contractor without a domain email account, they still can't sign in even if the account exists. In Jira, we do this because we use a giant shared CAS/LDAP auth system and it has both staff and users in it and the email addy regex mask protects us if someone screwed up and put a user in the wrong group or someone finds a vuln in our auth system and escalates their own rights. Doesn't matter, they still can't get access because the email accounts are completely separate.
Perhaps this would be an easier approach. cols = df.columns col = [] for feed in cols.levels[0]: for field in ['Day','TimeStamp','MW']: col.append((feed,field)) df[col] MultiIndex work like a dictionary with keys that are tuples. As long as you build up the necessary tuple you can access any content of a pandas dataframe. You can create a MultiIndex dataframe directly using a dictionary. a = {('Feeder # 1','TimeStamp'):['2/3','2/4','2/5'], ('Feeder # 1','MW'):[1.2,2.3,3.4], ('Feeder # 1','Month'):[1,1,2], ('Feeder # 1','Day'):[30,31,1], ('Feeder # 2','TimeStamp'):['2/3','2/3','2/3'], ('Feeder # 2','MW'):[2.4,4.1,3.7], ('Feeder # 2','Month'):[1,1,2], ('Feeder # 2','Day'):[30,31,1]} pd.DataFrame(a) Feeder # 1 Feeder # 2 Day MW Month TimeStamp Day MW Month TimeStamp 0 30 1.2 1 2/3 30 2.4 1 2/3 1 31 2.3 1 2/4 31 4.1 1 2/3 2 1 3.4 2 2/5 1 3.7 2 2/3 and accessing with a tuple, df[[('Feeder # 1','Day')]] Feeder # 1 Day 0 30 1 31 2 1 or, df[('Feeder # 1','Day')] 0 30 1 31 2 1 Name: (Feeder # 1, Day), dtype: int64 
@ /r/iamspoilt I am curious if you're the author of the article. And I am curious on the choice of kafka-python vs pykafka.
Hey [/user/jringstad](https://www.reddit.com/user/jringstad). I am currently doing [this in](https://github.com/prodicus/thanos/blob/de6c2924079b38847e0260e9a14bf3f7d3c6514b/thanos/gui.py#L129-L133) my `gui.py` and I thought it would work.. I thought about validating emails using `WTForms` or `Django`'s built in form validation tool. But it looked like an overkill to me. So I didn't go ahead with that. If you don't mind, could you teach me an alternative to what I am doing in my `gui.py`. I am still a newbie in this. Thanks for your time :) 
Yes, I have read your `gui.py`, and it does not work that way. You need to actually learn how SQL injections happen and how they are properly prevented. Read up on parameterized queries, and read up on what pythons `format()` actually does. Try pasting your code that uses `.format()` on the REPL and put in different values for username and password, and see what you get out. You'll quickly find a way to inject the query. That the injection didn't work in your screenshot is pure coincidence...
&gt; you have SQL code and validation in gui.py, which is not a good separation-of-concerns I thought so, which functions do you think would be appropriate to put into another file? &gt;you mix firstLowerCamelCase and underscore_style, sometimes even in the same identifier names But isn't `self._usernameLabel` more readable than `self._usernamelabel`? &gt;your "tests" don't really do anything? I'm not sure where you were going with that Sorry for that :D, as ? But I am not sure how do I test a `tkinter` application. Could you explain some things in which I could possibly test this. I don't have much experience writing tests. :/ &gt; you need to do better error-checking, e.g. for your SQL calls (that would've also revealed why your attack appeared to "fail" in the "mitigated" screenshot even though your application is still vulnerable) Didn't get that one. Thanks for your time :)
A spelling checker, maybe?
The pythonic way to name variables would be `self.username_label`
English lessons?
Simply reading the wikipedia article should give you a good introduction: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection Also, never trust escaping et cetera as measures against SQL injection. They are strictly inferior to using parameterized statements, which are not only the superior, 100% safe solution, but also will give your application a performance benefit, due to their increased predictability for the SQL server you are interacting with.
To add to this, functional programming doesn't mean *completely forbidding* objects. It's entirely acceptable to have classes and objects, you're just not allowed to mutate their state once they've been created. Think datetime, it has state but aside from some C juju (in CPython at least), you can't change that state. Instead, when you do `replace` or `astimezone`, you get a brand new datetime object. Using immutable objects is very similar to how Haskell uses closures and even some monads. Option in Scala is implemented as an interface while Some and None are classes that implement it.
"A code"? That grates on me so bad every time I read it. I don't even know what it is (in the context of programming).
Increasingly I've been writing my Python libraries in a functional way but with an object-oriented API where methods just call the appropriate function. I was motivated to do this because I found classes with lots of lines of code difficult to work with. Also it made tests easier to write. Named tuples are also very useful (they're like immutable dicts/objects).
I mean, they did. That's what python 2.6 and 2.7 were- backports of features from python 3.0 and 3.1, respectively. But they weren't going to keep backporting stuff forever.
This syntax is one of the many reasons I prefer Python 3
What'd you find strange about it? Many people dislike the semantic whitespace when writing, but agree that when reading it makes it easier to understand code. 
I really wish the author had used [the partition recipe](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/itertools.html#itertools-recipes) from the itertools library as partition_values, while more efficient, highlights a lot of what I think drives people away from functional programming def partition_values(vals): return reduce(lambda l, v: l[v % 2].append(v) or l, vals, ([], [])) Alternatively, it would be a **great** place to demonstrate that functional methods can themselves utilize state that most people are quite comfortable with... def partition_values(vals): odds, evens = [], [] for v in vals: if v % 2: odds.append(v) else: evens.append(v) return evens, odds
Not a good way to do it but works I guess. It starts with an empty string and for each character in the text, adds that to the front of the result ("rev"). http://stackoverflow.com/questions/931092/reverse-a-string-in-python for a good solution. 
The for loop reassigns rev to i + rev so it basically pushes the letter it's on to the front of the string. i.e., h, eh, leh, lleh, olleh ...
use what works best for you. no one is interested in convincing you.
"A lot" is two words. Now you're learning English while you learn Python!

Which OS?
I just got trolled hard by python OO coming from a C#/F#/Haskell background, I'd defined a class variable instead of an instance variable and didn't know what was going wrong.
&gt; This is huge and I hope the original poster considers it with some deep thought. I love the fact that year old Python code takes zero time to understand, this especially as a casual programmer. You can write hideous confusing nonsense in any language. I've seen python code as horrifying as any Java monstrosity.
Not sure if there is a Python lib, but in general, this can be done as described here: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Display_Power_Management_Signaling
You may want to give more detail. What's the project structure look like? What exact command are you running? Stuff like that
I've used [pyCiaro](http://cairographics.org/pycairo/) for high quality line drawing.
Im running a simple 'pyinstaller --version' command. Nothing fancy. I can't even get to my project, is the problem. I'm stuck at the first step, where i can't get pyinstaller to respond.
Try google optimization tools; https://or-tools.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/documentation/user_manual/manual/vrp/cvrp.html
I know Selenium is well-known...I just hadn't realized how effective (well, if you know Python and not just Node and JS) and easy it is to use for automating screenshots. I've actually started using it to scrape various government sites that use way too much JavaScript for their own good (i.e. making it clunky to get to basic public information)...normally I scrape AJAX-heavy webpages by inspecting the site traffic and then crafting requests and lxml to target the specific data endpoints....but Selenium has been so easy to use that I'm kind of OK with doing things via browser. An example of a JS-heavy government site is this Senate financial disclosures listing: https://efdsearch.senate.gov/search/home/ It requires checking an "Agree to terms" box (which does not appear if JS is turned off) before moving to the search page...and the search page itself will sometimes crash if you request too many records listing at one time, even though the total number of records is just ~2000 rows. The site tracks the session via cookie so it's not trivial to automate interaction via Requests alone.
Close. Your `seconddate` is the same as the first date, so you'll always get zero days zero hours zero minutes as the difference. Put a constant date as the first or second date e.g. `seconddate = datetime(1980, 1, 1, 0, 0) #Midnight Jan 1 1980` Then at the bottom you're doing the conversion to `total_seconds` but never using the value. You should be printing the value, like this: `print "This is the difference in time in seconds:" + (firstdate - seconddate).total_seconds` No need to construct a new datetime with all those difference elements, just do one date minus the other.
sound interesting, but I could't finde anything that would help me to detect in my Script if the monitor is on or in standby
&gt;Should it alter any of the parameters that **where** supplied? No I feel like a complete tool for not continuing to read an article when I stumble such grammar mistake :( edit: not implying my grammar is error free
I'm sorry for mispelling it.. I'm from Croatia,hope i wont make mistakes like that with Python! 
Your English is pretty good! This is a misspelling most native speakers make all the time and it makes me insane.
/r/learnpython
I'd consider mutating a completely internally contained list to be functional enough. It's a pragmatic approach rather than a pure one. The list mutation is an implementation detail. 
I'm with you. I also think the same thing every time I read it.
This might be unhelpful, but maybe not since we don't know why you want to know, but you could use python to wiggle the mouse a tiny bit, thus waking up the screen. Then you'd know it was not on standby :)
I don't know of a pure python interface, but [ddcontrol](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ddccontrol/) can do this - you'll probably need to parse the output, and look for the "power control" value setting to detect current state.
Yep, native speakers get it wrong too. http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html
Sure--but mixedCase should be avoided in variables, according to PEP8. variables are supposed to follow function naming, except where prevailing code has it in another style, like mixedCase. So, I guess: `self._username_label` ? edit: `s/camelCase/mixedCase/`
Sauce Labs is pretty much a hosted Selenium provider and really good at what they do. I think their engineers actually created the project? Check them out if you need to do this on a larger scale.
You don't get a traceback? 
Which functions produce errors? What are the errors? In general, though, [`strftime`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.strftime) does have platform-dependent quirks, since it is pretty much just a wrapper for your system's native C `strftime`.
Hey, this is great. Thanks Further research led me to using Categorical Indices: I can generate a new Multiindex with the header columns as dtype='category' and that preserves the order. The only problem I'm having is that I have to manually specify the order of the second header row: TimeStamp through Hour. When I do df.columns.levels[1] Python automatically sorts the order (i.e. alphabetical from Day to TimeStamp). Do you know of a way to call the columns method and tell Python NOT to sort everything automatically? I discovered that if I apply the columns method on just a single feeder df['Feeder #1'].columns the output is in the original TimeStamp to Hour order. But that's an inelegant way to get the order I want. Any ideas?
On tooling: Java has more thorough support for dependency resolution, better IDE support (from more vendors), lots of useful twisty knobs to change the runtime (including switching out garbage collectors!), to name a few things. On 2 vs 3. Anyone writing a new project is silly not to write it in Python three. What I meant is that there are now lots of orphaned libraries, wrong stack overflow questions, new best practices, and versioned documentation. This is annoying.
They contribute to it I believe, but Selenium was created initially by Thoughtworks in Chicago.
Use a [Session object](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/) to maintain cookies between requests. 
Sure, but all monads are functors and he's probably not using non-monad functor examples.

&gt;Increasingly I've been writing my Python libraries in a functional way but with an object-oriented API where methods just call the appropriate function. Could you explain this? Do the API methods do anything else to the parameters before passing to the appropriate function? At first glance, it just seems like an unnecessary layer. 
Beware: This won't work on some websites. Selenium is comprised and it's possible to detect a browser running in Selenium. 
Cool. Yeah, the tuple method is nice and flexible. Thanks again. You've been more than helpful. I really appreciate you taking the time to help out a beginner.
Check out http://selenium-python.readthedocs.org/waits.html for a solution more robust than `sleep`.
It downloads one package, every single time? It looks nice, but in the long run I'm going to stick with workon sandbox pip install some_package ipython
I thought this was science for a second and I was so confused. Thanks for sharing! We're always looking for ways to scale our tests. 
Anaconda and OpenCV is unfortunately not a very good match. Luckily, on Linux systems, building your own OpenCV is quite easy. There are also channels with OpenCV 3+ (which is the first versions with Python 3 support) built by other users available. One very nice thing about moving to 3.5 is the new matrix multiplication operator. I'd argue that this alone makes it quite attractive to switch. Because even though I had gotten used to `np.dot(A, B)`, it is hard to go back to it when `A @ B` makes your code so much nicer. Oh, and the new division rules are awesome.
I compiled OpenCV successfully on Ubuntu a couple of times. See instructions here: http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/07/20/install-opencv-3-0-and-python-3-4-on-ubuntu/ There's no reason you wouldn't be able to install OpenCV manually in your Anaconda installation.
For windows systems, you can take the prebuilt whl file from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#opencv and install it on a 3.4 python. I'm not sure, if anaconda can install whl files, but i use winpython 3.4 and for that it works like a charm.
How are the default themes still completely useless - and have been for months, I just don't understand it. Do you guys not use your own software? https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-149977 and on top of that some things that mitigate that issue are also broken https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-151668
I find objects easier to use than remembering which of the functions I imported from various libraries does what to what. But classes with lots of lines of code are cumbersome, so I prefer writing it in a functional style and then put a simple (and optional) object-oriented wrapper on top. &gt; Do the API methods do anything else to the parameters before passing to the appropriate function? Rarely, most of the functions are attached to the class using partials.
Nowadays I'm installing Anaconda (Python 3.5) to get some base modules (especially [numpy with MKL](https://docs.continuum.io/mkl-optimizations/index)). If a module is not in the official repository or is not up-to-date, I just install it normally as you would in a vanilla installation, which could be installing from a binary or building it myself. Besides those base modules, I don't think Anaconda always provides much benefit as the hype/marketing wants you to believe. Though it is great if you want to install multiple versions and for beginners to easily install the most common modules. 
While I think the quote is quite a waste of time, the authors blog isn't if you're into data science and machine learning: http://sebastianraschka.com/blog/index.html
&gt;Selenium seems far more accurate than PhantomJS They're not the same thing. PhantomJS is a browser, just like firefox. Selenium is a tool for automating browsers. Your code works perfectly with PhatomJS, you just need to use it instead of Firefox: driver = webdriver.PhantomJS() I would also add driver.close() at the end, to close Firefox window. Cool post though! EDIT: wrote too fast, PhantomJS is not stricktly speaking a browser.
Yeh, it's kind of an encapsulation thing, once there is more than one reference to the object in existence it shouldn't be mutated as that means you can end up having to reason non-locally. That's really the advantage of immutability, all reasoning can happen locally, there is no chance of data races, no chance of some other function changing the object you're looking at between 2 function calls etc etc. Immutability is a bit of a blunt instrument for doing this. It basically says nothing may mutate objects ever! There are much more elegant ways, for example Rust's model which works by ensuring that if there is more that one reference to an object nothing may mutate it, but if you have the only reference to it you can do whatever you want. It's an interesting area of the design space.
Immutability is only one part of a functional object though. It should also be idempotent, which immutability makes a whole lot easier. The way I've found works best for me is something like what Gary Bernhardt put forth in his Boundaries talk. Functional objects at the core that make all the choices and handle logic. And pliable, mutable objects that feed them information about the outside world that handle things like network access, databases, etc. And nice interface between the two that keeps the IO out of my functional objects.
From what I understood, parameterized queries don't allow improper substitutions of variables and prevents anything improper from finding it's way inside the query. I hope that is pretty much to it? Isn't it?
Yes. A parameterized query never even substitutes the arguments into the query, just like calling a function with two arguments doesn't actually substitute those arguments into the actual sourcecode of the function before executing the function. So the parameters can contain absolutely whatever you want it to, and no escaping needs to happen at any point, simply because data is treated differently from source. As a general lesson, substituting things into source-code and then executing the source-code is rarely a good idea security-wise.
Can also use aiohttp + aiohttp-wsgi to run a Cherrypy app as async.
It's pragmatic. I appreciate Haskell's insistence about pureness, but sometimes I need to add logging right there because that's where I know the information's wonky. It sounds like we're on the same page though. I'll admit, I'm not 100% on board with Gary's FauxO styling, but it's probably a disconnect between what he means and how I interpret it. I've also seen some really horrendous implementations of it, too. Like doing a linear search through database results "because the domain is responsible for it" instead of having a handful of domain rules bent ever so slightly because it's a much better implementation. 
&gt; Now that I had a little bit of time to breathe what should I have done? &lt;joke&gt;Use Haskell?&lt;/joke&gt;: https://github.com/begriffs/postgrest
Yeh, we're definitely on the same page. I find in that kind of situation there is usually some beautifully abstract way to structure things that will have equivalent performance, if I have a week to explore it... Or I could exploit mutability or add in a logging statement or use an exception for control flow or some other dirty, but encapsulated, hack. Usually it's number 2, and it gets a FIXME comment and a bug ticket...
But from the analogy, will the database not create a copy of the arguments(rogue if you may say) and try to substitute them? 
/r/learnpython
Sweet, good to know! Personally I'm not really a t-shirt or shorts guy, so I'll probably stick with the jeans and button downs but maybe put the tie on hold. Thanks for the response!
I've never used Elastic Beanstalk, but can't you just [eb ssh](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb3-ssh.html) into the server instance and then run whatever commands you want?
&gt; Rarely, most of the functions are attached to the classes using partials. !!! That sounds like a massive red flag to me. Why do that when you can either make the functions actual methods that operate on common data *or* group them into modules and pretend the module is a class with only staticmethods? It sounds like you've got anemic classes because you're expected to write classes rather than making classes because they're a good abstraction tool.
I generally wear company logo polos and feel comfortable. And I meant to imply that *you* might *feel* overdressed in a tie, and not that the community will make you feel that way. There will be a whole range of fashion!
Does python need to create a copy of your function before executing it, substituting the arguments? It does not, because function is code, and the arguments are just pieces of data, sitting in a buffer somewhere in memory. When the function wants to do something to the data, it can just "refer" to it. You can think of the data and the code to be living in entirely different worlds, or to be sent to the database server through entirely separate channels. Imagine if you had two connections to the database server, one that accepts code, and one that accepts data If you send the code through the code channel, the database server can compile it, and when it executes the code, the code by itself takes two arguments from the argument channel, and then does things with those arguments. The arguments never get substituted into the actual source-code before the sourcecode is interpreted and executed. In fact, the database will take your SQL query with the ? in it, compile it into an executable program (that takes two parameters) and then forget about the original sourcecode before it even ever looks at the arguments that you supplied. This, by the way, is also the key to why parameterized queries help performance. If you substitute -- even if you do it securely -- you will generate a new SQL query each time: SELECT name FROM users WHERE username = 'usera' and password = 'passworda' SELECT name FROM users WHERE username = 'userb' and password = 'passwordb' SELECT name FROM users WHERE username = 'userc' and password = 'passwordc' ... This means you have to send the query to the database each time, the database has to parse the query, optimize it, compile it into its final form, then run it. If you use a parameterized query, all this work is only done once, just like the python interpreter only has to look at your function once and compile it. You can then call the same parameterized query many many times with different arguments, and it will be executed with those arguments right away. No need to recompile or anything. If you execute the same query many times, this will greatly speed things up.
Cool, thanks for the clarification. It seems like a very welcoming atmosphere! 
Everyone thinks their library is easy to use. How do you know yours is? Is every subjectively easy to use library 'for Humans?' All I see from the README was that you like property accessors. 
Take a look at this book: http://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Python-Network-Programming-Brandon/dp/1430258543/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1458571130&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=brandon+rhodes
I wish you are enjoying property accessors too.
Not all time formatting codes are supported on all platforms, so it is possible that Python on Windows will raise an error. and From https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html : &gt; Although this module is always available, not all functions are available on all platforms. Most of the functions defined in this module call platform C library functions with the same name. It may sometimes be helpful to consult the platform documentation, because the semantics of these functions varies among platforms. The traceback would help. It could possibly be the %f in locale?
Echoing the "it is mostly tshirts/jeans" but if PyCon had a dress code it would probably be "Please wear clothes." ! :) 
Definately. Just throwing numpy in for one or two functions is rarely a good idea, as datatype conversion is expensive. But OP does their own dtype conversion too. Hmm.
Couple of months ago I made similar product in golang https://github.com/phonkee/goexpose
Here are a few reasons that spring to mind that might be common reasons for attending a conference in general. * networking with industry professionals * exposure to new or state of the art ideas/techniques/products * a chance to contribute to seminars, discussions, working groups in person. For someone just getting a start in their professional career there might be opportunities to give a resume out. But in my mind attending will be more about learning as much as you can about the current state, and future trends in the industry. That sort of knowledge when applied to your work will look good to potential employers. It's also just fun!

 &gt;Or the objects removed since they actually sound like a Grab Bag of Staticmethods. That's what it sounds like, but I guess I'd have to see the init method first. Thanks for your opinion. It sounds really unnecessary and not pythonic at all. 
That sounds probable, but wasn't the case. On 3.5.1 and numpy 1.10 a 25 item list yield only a 30% increase in execution time of `np.std()` due to calling it with a list instead of array. The pure python version from the blog post was indeed about 5x faster.
`workon` is simply virtualenvwrapper?
That said, it's always faster to call the `math` module for basic functions like `sin`, `cos`, and `sqrt` than numpy. Granted if that matters you probably have bigger problems. EDIT: I was talking about for length 1 arrays. Try it.
Why make these REST at all instead of just connecting to the DB?
I don't like having to make sure the method's arguments match up with the functions' if I can help it. I still use a lot of methods, especially if that's where the logging logic is.
I'm going to have to agree that this sounds like a major anti-pattern. 9 times out of 10, if you're doing something that goes against typical convention (like partial functions instead of methods), there's probably a greater design problem.
The tutorials look great but the conf talks look to be really geared towards beginners this year. Would have been nice to hear some more talks in favor of writing functional python and the current state of gaming in Python. 
This is what I used to learn Python from Matlab. I wasn't looking for a 1:1 guide. I wanted to learn to do things Python style, not just Matlab style in Python. This was a pretty good guide in my opinion
I've only been once, in San Jose; it was FREAKIN AWESOME. There was even a python powered Angry-Birds-playing robot. The talks are great. The people are great. I crashed the open-bar VIP reception after everybody had a few and rubbed elbows with a few minor Python celebrities. As an independent I found more competitors than customers, however. There seemed to be a lot more focus on connecting job seekers with permanent positions.
The talks are awesome, but considering you can watch them all after the fact, that's not really the reason to go. There's lots of good networking to be done, tutorials/sprints/etc where you get a little more hands on work, and it's just generally fun to be surrounded by people who are interested in the same things as you are! I went last year and the best part was feeling very invigorated about my career and feeling excited about learning new things.
the strange after hours orgies complete with arguing whether that is the 'most pythonic' way to fuck a hooker.
Very cool!

Why would you go to a concert? 
A couple of thoughts: * The "for humans" tagline come across as arrogant because it implies that the package has some mark of quality in good API design and is superior to existing options. To use the tagline comes across as presumptuous, especially when the implementation seems so trivial. * The "for humans" tagline is [overused](http://charlesleifer.com/blog/describing-projects-as-for-humans-must-stop/). * Calling our projects requirements files 'adorable' comes across as oddly patronizing, as if only the big boys use 'install_requires' or something. I don't think that's your intent, but it kind of hilariously comes across that way. Additional comments: * Not a fan of dumping '**r.requirements' into my setup. It isn't initially completely clear what is being overridden. Now I need to inspect the package's code. * Your readme is incorrect - should be \*\*r.dependecies, not \*\*r.requirements. * You cannot re-upload botched releases to pypi - it would be nice to have a quick way of inspecting the output without having to open up a shell. * I would also have to agree with ivosaurus. Concrete requirements (especially frozen/compiled requirements) are meant more for application deployments, while setup.py is intended to represent more abstract dependencies for redistributable libraries. I would be very upset if a third party django app used pip-tools + requirements to pin Django to 1.7.1
1. https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/ 2. [So you are asking if we could code something for your unix trojaner?](https://imgflip.com/s/meme/Futurama-Fry.jpg) 3. Recap your problem. I read your text three times and could not figure out, what you exactly need. If you need some server/client in python work then with sockets.
There is a bunch of things using SQLAlchemy to do that, some more and some less automated -- they either inspect the existing DB or use a user-provided model. As I never used any of those, I cannot give you a recommendation. Search for `sqlalchemy rest` to get a taste. 
To me, it's a lot like university. Sure, you an find lectures online for most subjects, but what I enjoyed the most about my university experience is being able to chat up with the prof after school and pick at their amazing brain for a few minutes.

Oh well , nevermind.I found my errors.I didn't put an integer for the numbers and i forgot to put the variables. e.g add(n, n2)
haha sorry, I inconvenienced you 2 seconds out of your day...
Also: Brandon Rhodes, Larry Hastings
Although a different purpose it's slightly similar to [pipsi](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi/)
This doesn't quite answer your question, but I have a bot I've written that just uses boto to read from an Amazon SQS to _get_ messages from slack and then I just post to their incoming webhook with requests. This bot has been used daily for the past yearish to do all sorts of things for us that we've automated. Sorry I can't share the code, it's pretty ugly but has a lot of our proprietary functionality in it.
What do you want to do? Maybe [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) is good enough.
My last 3 jobs came from people I met at PyCon.
A while back we had two competing bot's, mine (the library used the json api) and coworkers that connected via irc. I used a now dead python library. I really depends on what you want. I try to find libraries that have aged but are still actively developed.
&gt;What exactly goes on at PyCon events? It's famous for its dongle jokes
Thanks for the replies, everyone. The helpful ones, anyway. My knowledge of Python is still quite basic and it is difficult to put my finger on why I find it strange. I suppose it's mostly the syntax and dynamic typing (...uh, what kind of structure/type am I dealing with again?) and it does seem to have a very different 'philosophy' than what I'm used to. Anyway I plan to keep at it, I guess I was just looking for some motivation and was curious if anyone else had gone through the same thing.
Any time you find yourself naming a bunch of variables with consecutive numbered names, that's a pretty good indication that you should be using a list. Or you can skip the list and just use `collections.Counter`, which is useful whenever you want to count things. &gt;&gt;&gt; import collections, random &gt;&gt;&gt; counts = collections.Counter(random.randint(1, 6) + random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(10)) &gt;&gt;&gt; for val, count in sorted(counts.items()): print('{} = {}'.format(val, count)) 2 = 1 3 = 1 4 = 1 5 = 1 6 = 2 7 = 1 8 = 1 9 = 2 
One non-obvious trick I've been able to use a lot on JS websites is that Selenium lets you execute arbitrary Javascript code, and many JS based websites will have a variable (or variables) in scope that has all the data you are looking for. You can then pull this object into a dictionary or list without scraping the DOM.
How did that happened? Did you give a talk or something?
I too can google.
&gt; I try to find libraries that have aged but are still actively &gt; developed. Thanks, that is good advice. I think slacker is looking the best so far.
Maybe https://github.com/trivio/splicer
Use the anaconda distribution https://www.continuum.io/downloads It is dead simple and has all the binary packages you might need for Windows and all the other platforms for that matter. No Compiler needed and no problems typically. Worst Case might be that you need to set up an environment for Python 3 because last time I checked Standard was 2.7. But that is two commands if I remember right. 
give them an IDE that manages virtualenvs (e.g. PyCharm)
Absolutely. Anaconda and Christoph Glolkes "unofficial windows binaries" page are godsends to anyone who has to learn python or develop in a windows environment. http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ This really should be right under the windows download button on the main python distribution web page as it would save so much aggravation the first time the user ran into a missing compiler error.
Two more: David Beazley.
What an absolute fustercluck.
Bookmarked. I noticed they lack some stuff, like RPi.GPIO for example. Still great stuff and I will probably spread the word :)
You can get LSD at PyCon???
I oppose this, in PyCharm you can develop in your own local venv for the Pi and then deploy or directly run the code on the Pi over SSH.
Anaconda is available both as a default python2 or python3 version
Wise words, and I agree that system knowledge is important, but compare the Python experience to the one you get if you try Ruby. PyPi vs RubyGems, I think Ruby does this better in every way if you are an inexperienced user. You have to start somewhere, and I think Python does so many things right, improve the package management and I think we have a superior model!
Because that's what lisp uses, and most languages inherited it from there. Lisp got the concept from lambda calculus, where each function is anonymous, so that's the root of the term.
haha cool, i will do my tax with TurboTax and then run this app and compare results
Has anyone stepped up to take the place of pyvideo? It was a fantastic resource and a far better way to find videos than Youtube.
does ruby include C code? As for making packages easier, there are already efforts ongoing (google for wheel and egg packages) Really, if you just want a painless windows experience use Anaconda (or miniconda). With that you basically get precompiled packages for your platform. This is what I do on Windows to keep my sanity ;)

That's not really tuned for speed.
One advantage of 'lambda' is that it distinguishes lambdas further from full-fledged functions, which aren't limited to a single expression. In other words, they are only conceptually "plan old anonymous functions"; practically, they have significant limitations. I agree that the term "lambda" in particular is needlessly hard for beginners, though.
Agreed, this is sweet.
Have you ever seen RPyC? Not exactly the same as your framework but also pretty cool for this kind of thing. . . Nice work, I think I'm going to use this soon.
&gt; Raymond Hettinger I didn't purchase tickets, bit pricey to attend, but he's the reason I wanted to go. I've watched his talks before. It's weird how charismatic he seems while talking.

Your error relates to this issue: https://github.com/seemethere/nba_py/issues/16 I haven't gotten around to updating the package on pypi yet but to get the most up to date version you can simply install using: `pip install git+https://github.com/seemethere/nba_py.git`
congrats on only owing $90. my fiance is si excited she's getting back $2k. I can't seem to help her understand why that is no cause for celebration... 
I had trouble `make`ing it on both OS X and ubuntu, FYI... I can share details if you're interested.
Looks like they have a pretty good wrapper for the api in python: https://github.com/soundcloud/soundcloud-python. All of that stuff should be doable! You can run a script every so often that pulls the data and then writes to a csv file when new info is found. 
Yes you can. With logistic regression, your dependent variable isn't the outcome itself (a win or a loss) but the ODDS of a win versus a loss. The relationship between the odds of success and your independent variables will be linear. So, you'll be able to say that having an all star improves your odds by X amount. I haven't done logistic with scikit but I'm sure there is a way to get predicted probabilities from the regression. If you're looking for % chance of winning, that's the number you want.
Yep!
It's trying to install a Windows update for Windows 10 C runtime compatibility, but getting an error that the update isn't applicable to your computer. I eventually found out it has another large "roll up" update as a prerequisite that isn't necessarily installed automatically by Windows Update. I'll see if I can find the relevant KB item when I get home. EDIT: Python 3.5 requires [KB2999226](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2999226) on Windows 8.1, which itself requires at least one of the updates included in [KB2919355](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2919355). Try installing KB2919355 manually, and then the Python installer should be able to install KB2999226. Check the "Known issues" section on those KB articles if one or the other fails to install.
Nice. I prefer uwsgi to gunicorn though.
Can you give me any feedback on the simplified color scheme: http://www.hug.rest/website/latest does it look better?
I would look at CasperJS bindings for PhantomJS if you prefer JS to Python. Webdriver.IO and Nightwatch look pretty cool too. I'm pretty happy if I'm writing in JS or Python. In all honesty launching a browser is expensive. If I'm going to pay the fee regardless I say go premium every time with Selenium. As others have mentioned you can use Sauce Labs, a commercial yet extremely effective tool. If you're looking to test for specific scenarios I recommend py.test with xdist to parallelize Selenium/test runs. I run up to 10 tests at a time. I also use the py.test selenium and variables plugin to reduce boilerplate and configure the test suite. If you can reuse the browser session even better because you're saving more time. If you're interested in more selenium checkout page objects, action chains, and expected conditions.
You could use Google Translate APIs. https://cloud.google.com/translate/v2/using_rest#detect-language
More like a broke my expectation ;)
You meet a hundred people everyday, half of them are hiring. Plus there is usually a job fair on the last day. 
Try some projecteuler.net or checkio.org. PE is for maths problems, checkio is a mix of maths and other programming problems. checkio is python specific and to pass the problem it actually tests your code, PE you can use anything you like. Both Track your progress. They're fun ways to improve if you don't have a particular project right now, and they start from beginner level.
&gt; To add to this, functional programming doesn't mean completely forbidding objects. It's entirely acceptable to have classes and objects, you're just not allowed to mutate their state once they've been created. Completely forbidding objects is not possible in python anyway, nearly everything is an object, even all immutable types and functions of course: In [14]: def f(x): ....: return x ....: In [15]: type(f) Out[15]: function In [16]: isinstance(f, object) Out[16]: True In [17]: type(1) Out[17]: int In [18]: isinstance(1, object) Out[18]: True Just an addition.

or, _or_, you could set up a samba (or what have you) share on the Pi, write your code in the IDE of choice right in that share, and just ssh=&gt;python?
Here is my try: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/3de452e610b57c6cf9bb jitting the initial standard_deviation function will not work. Numba is specialized for dealing with numpy arrays. I added a few comments. Maybe those will help you understand.
https://gist.github.com/anonymous/3de452e610b57c6cf9bb
Here is the same thing with numba: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/3de452e610b57c6cf9bb Edit: With mobile Chrome, the IPython Notebook doesn't seem to render. Desktop seems fine though.
Python works fine, fix their OS
I'm pretty sure it's fancy dress. This year's theme is cows. Don't listen to these guys saying tshirts and jeans. Book your cow suit now so you don't look silly. (and have a shower every day. That'll be better than many)
Despite the great Anaconda Distribution and the ability to compile on Windows out of the box with the latest Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition with installed Python Tools, there is another great alternative for such purposes. In fact, I recently gave a little python 101 myself and found this very helpful: http://winpython.github.io/ You just unpack it and have a fully operational, self-consistent python distribution, that you can even register system-wide with their custom Control Panel and re-distribute to other machines easily. I unpacked a fresh folder, installed some packages that are not very commonly used (trackpy, PhysicalQuantities, ...), put a bunch of my own Jupyter Notebooks and some tutorial notebooks in the notebook folder, re-packed it, and gave this to my students. This way, everyone had the exact same distro, running out of the box with all packages they needed without installing them first, and they even had every Jupyter Notebook ready at hand to get started immediately. Found this very comfortable :)
&gt; it performs the completely unnecessary allocation and filling of an `std::vector` But that prevents needing multiple iterations of the `list`, which may well (or may not) pay for itself.
Really a beautiful project. I made something similar with my RemI GUI library https://github.com/dddomodossola/remi/tree/master/editor . Just a question. When I build an App, should I install a local webserver on the host machine?
Getting a bunch of money back often means you don't have withholding set up correctly. That is a bad thing. 
*shrug* I'll tell her you said that, she'll be thrilled, lol
...are you using floats for money?
Could I ask, out of interest, what inspired you to build this? A lot of projects start out as "same as *x*, but better", so I'm curious to hear from you what your motivation was and how you think you've improved on other REST API frameworks.
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*.

BlackMonk.com could be your best bet. It has everything you need from fast loading dashboard navigation to selection of themes. The code is clean and easy to work on. BlackMonk uses Python with Django framework. Know more: http://www.blackmonk.com/blog/
Didn't try the double-pass PyList version, a single-pass straight C version takes about 25% the runtime of the C++ version (on 25k elements input)
I think I've addressed this pretty well in the architecture document: http://www.hug.rest/website/learn/ hug is not "same as x, but better" and never claims to be. It's an entirely different paradigm then what frameworks in the past have provided. hug is about defining your API once, and then defining how you expose via decorators over multiple interfaces. It's just a bonus that in all the commonly used metrics (performance, tloc, etc) hug almost always outperforms any thing that handles just one piece of what it aims to (flask for instance for HTTP) which helps to validate the approach.
&gt; pyvideo I don't even know why pyvideo exists. YouTube is perfectly suitable for this and people will won't have to worry about what happens when the maintainers get bored.
you mean, like, using the IDE with a remote site-packages? cause if you don't mean that, then the problem doesn't get solved, you don't get the symbols from the rpi package in the IDE
...isn't that what virtualenvs are for?
If you're looking to build this to _learn_ go for it. Proxys are difficult things, and turn really REALLY complex, quickly. Squid is pretty state of the art, and that doesn't do all the things you're looking at here. However, if you want to actually save your bandwidth, you're better off trying Opera Turbo or similar product.
Installing VS. I was very close to dual booting and not going near windows again until I found the prebuilt wheels.
Wish something like this existed when I was 11/12... Well it still doesn't exist in my country. Pretty sad thing for our children here...
I do wonder why they didn't use an existing pinout. Both Arduino and RPI have defined poplar pinouts that support dozens of shields. Partly because of this choice, I worry that this will be forced on kids without any organic community developing around the hardware or software.
Excuse me if I missed something, but does the "Code" section run Python 2? Or can I somehow configure it to accept Python 3? Also, can I somehow import certain pypy modules, like numpy? Thanks, it looks great. Needs more tutorials, though. Good luck!
Thanks. I'll look into it more closely. Building a large API for a personal project right now using Flask, so it'll be interesting to see how I'd be working if I used Hug instead.
Thanks! This helped a lot. That `nopython` argument will certainly come in handy as I play around with this more. I'm guessing that numba doesn't support list comprehensions, which is too bad because I think they are more readable than for loops. Perhaps in most cases, we can avoid loops altogether by sticking to vector operations.

As /u/jck said, look into sphinx. It can autogenerate .rst files from your project (most all of the rst files will be using automodule which will pull data from your modules' docstrings). Afterwards, you can use sphinx-build to build out the html files. To use the readthedocs theme, you'll need to install the package (use pip), then in your sphinx conf.py: import sphinx_rtd_theme # .... html_theme = 'sphinx_rtd_theme' # ... html_theme_path = [sphinx_rtd_theme.get_html_theme_path()] Then after you build your HTML files it should use the theme. 
Flake8 3.0 has planned a way to allow for this. The full functionality, however, has not been fleshed out and will need community involvement.
Did I miss something? Why can't you use pip?
If the rows are truly identical duplicates, create a hash set of seen rows. Using a lazy iterator over the lines, process chunks of 30 lines and emit the first one that doesn't hash to a previously seen value. If is newline separated, you don't even need to parse the CSV.
Because I like listening to music, and hearing it live is even better. Plus, it's really the only way that performing musicians can make money from their art these days, and I like supporting the arts. In contrast, I don't like hearing people talk about technical topics (I'd rather read it), and I can't imagine how hearing it live would help. (I hated computer science lectures in college. Despite being my major, they were my least favorite part.) And it's not like working programmers have any trouble paying their rent. I don't understand this analogy. They're complete opposites to me.
So do something about it, things like this don't just happen, get organised and look support 
Oh , my bad , i'm sorry.
Well it's not like this is something you can do easily. You need a bunch of people, money and getting this into education will take years. Also I guess I'm the wrong guy for something like this, since I don't have any skills for such a project. Maybe when I'm older and got my own life right I will at least try to support something like this here. 
https://github.com/google/yapf might interest you, the readme also mentions a couple other formatters
Yeah, no list comprehension. But with numba, your brain should work either vectorized or with full-blown C loops anyway. You might find the vectorize options in numba useful.
Digital Ocean and Linode provide excellent documentation on their respective sites. I recently set up a Flask App on Digital Ocean using this tutorial as a guide: [How To Serve Flask Applications with uWSGI and Nginx on Ubuntu 14.04][1] [1]: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-flask-applications-with-uwsgi-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-14-04 Because of their popularity, if you run into issues following these guides, chances are there has already been discussion on one of their forums (which a quick Google search will reveal). They also link to many other great tutorials ([Initial Steps for Ubuntu 14.04][2], [Additional Steps for Ubuntu 14.04][3], [Protecting SSH on Ubuntu 14.04][4], [Setting up a Host Name][5], and [Securing with Let's Encrypt][6]) [2]: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-14-04 [3]: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/additional-recommended-steps-for-new-ubuntu-14-04-servers [4]: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-protect-ssh-with-fail2ban-on-ubuntu-14-04 [5]: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-host-name-with-digitalocean [6]: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-14-04
Define can't using pip. If you talk about c extensions, blame windows devs, if you talk about path variables, would you install python on C:\windows path? If you talk about pycharm doesn't have pip integration, try pycharm first, JUST DO IT, MAKE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE, YESTERDAY YOU SAID TOMORROW, SO JUST DO IT! 
That's an average of 32 bytes per line -- are they all that short? Are they all the same length? Do they have any internal structure, i.e., are you sure they have no quoted newlines? Do the choices have to be random, or can they just be arbitrary? Can temporary files be bigger than 1 GB? Can you use other services, or does it have to be pure Python? If this doesn't have to be Python, I'd say just make a 1-column database table, and load it into that. Databases have been around for a while and they're pretty good at things like big lists of short strings that don't fit in memory, and removing duplicates. 
That's incredible. I assumed the python was running server-side. Have you seen [R's shiny package](http://shiny.rstudio.com/)? It's fairly similar, except it allows you to design the page using R, and then can execute R code on the server whenever inputs are changed, etc... It seems like using Skulpt has the big advantage of keeping things client-side, but cuts out the possibility of using things like numpy and matplotlib. This seems very different from something like R shiny, which allows for general computation / plotting on the back-end. Actually, I guess Anvil could do it also, as in your Raspberry Pi example. Can the Raspberry Pi send data back to the client? With Anvil right now, it looks like you are providing a python-like way of doing what a framework like Angular might do. From what I saw in the tutorials, it's sort of like a MVVM setup: * View is specified graphically * Model View is essentially the python classes reacting to button presses, or binding data to view elements (e.g. text to a label element) * Model could be implemented separately as a python module or separate class Sorry this is long--Anvil seems like a very promising python tool! I had just a few questions.. * If the end product is JS and friends, will it be downloadable, so people can toy with using it as a front end for, say, a flask server? * Could Anvil easily create an analytics dashboard, similar to the shiny examples? (e.g. passing data from server to client) * Will all of this be run exclusively through your servers, or are parts of the library going to be made public? * If it's through your servers, who is your target audience?
I addressed this. If you get 2K back, you missed out on like $15 in interest due to overpaying. But you get intangibles like an unexpected windfall and some help keeping you from blowing your money in the previous year.
This makes sense. The new names are a lot more informative about what PEP8 and PEP257 are.
This should only take a couple gigabytes of memory, which is nice. The obvious downsides are that it's not taking random rows, and (unless the rows are all the same size) it's not taking the maximum number of unique rows. 
brilliant! thank you.

This sounds awesome. Flake8 is a great tool. [This](https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8/issues/84) seems to be the related issue, for those interested. I don't see more discussion about the modifying file part though. Is the plan to use something like autopep8/yapf, or going at the solution from a different angle?
When you're making a million devices, the existing pinout of other boards isn't really relevant. There's already a large amount of breakout boards which the microbit slots into.
Upside, takes 12 minutes to code and most likely good enough. 
nothing of value... NaN, NULL or None ?
That's an excellent point, and something we're thinking hard about. For now we support self-hosting in our enterprise plans, partly to answer that concern in addition to simplifying access to local resources like databases. 
Will happily pay for a quality project that I get to "own"
That's a good point--I should have said the first tutorial-esque moments you experience Angular, rather than the harrowing aftermath. I'll definitely have to look more closely--something like this seems like it has been missing for a long time. I'm taking your answers to mean that Anvil server will be closed source? Generally, I prefer a bit more control (for example, both R's Shiny and JS's Meteor let you run locally), but could definitely see the value of both approaches.
You could use autohotkey to maximize and position the window first, but other than that I don't know. I'm interested too
3.0 is quite a ways away from being complete. I'm still evaluating our options to see what will be best from a Flake8 user perspective as well as someone who develops a plugin to fix code automatically
importing modules with dashes? How'd that work out? But I agree, underscores or camelCases ...
What's the point of the `Lock` function? If it does the same thing as `_SockLock`, then why not just have `_SockLock` instead of `Lock`. I get that maybe you'll have future compatibility issues, but seriously I think YAGNI. In Python there are often better ways to add more functionality like that anyway (default arguments, class methods, etc). Also since `Lock` is cleverly disguised to look like a class, people might do `isinstance(some_object, Lock)` or subclass it or something similar and be confused. If you _really_ want to keep the `Lock` wrapper, at least make it a subclass of `_SockLock` or something. Other than that it looks pretty good to me.
 NoneType has no attribute: value
It never completes, it constantly receives data from a GPS. It does not ask for a password. There is no EOF character since it receives constant data from a GPS continuously. Do you think I should just read in line by line of the command prompt data or take a different approach?
Let me get this straight. When you run `python` in `cmd` from within any directory, you get the `&gt;&gt;&gt;` prompt, but you can't run something like `python path/to/your_script.py` ?
If I understand what your saying correctly, you'd have to have a separate script running that's watching the file and waiting for it to update, once it does that script would call the other script. 
All rows might not have the same length. They wont have quoted newlines. Choices have to be random, but I dont understand when you say random or arbitrary? what's the difference? My output file cannot be more than 1 GB. I cannot use databases as the input file size can be in TB's or even more. So, I think Python would be apt. 
This is weird. But kinda neat. Who is the target user? 
&gt; Doing it with double quotes just returns a line in single quotes to me. First time I've heard something like that happen. &gt; I can run the python script, it's just that it's crashing right now and I want the cmd window to stay open to see what line the problem is on. If you were to put something like print('Hello World!') inside a file called `hello.py` and run it, and the `cmd` window does not close by itself, then there's something in your code that's causing that to happen. For that part, I suggest opening a new post here, as this is getting off-topic (at least, this is no longer related to the original thread). That way, more experienced people can respond.

You seem to be under the impression that the VTK problems I'm dealing with are Windows related, they're not. In fact, I've been trying to set this up on Linux (Ubuntu, if relevant), and so far I have wasted 2 days on this. The whole experience with VTK is something I'd describe as fairly unpleasant: there don't seem to be any prebuilt versions of VTK7 (if they are, please correct me), the documentation ranges from 'indifferent' to 'passive-aggressive', the community _seems_ nonexistent (in fact, I saw some amusing inquiries on the mailing list whether there's a boycott of IRC due to nobody showing up on the channel). Finally, the build process is counterintuitive at times, and I admit I gave up trying to get the Python 3 version to work (which allegedly it should), when the whole thing fell apart trying to build twisted, of all things. "__*Twisted?*__ Really? Ugh, I mean, yeah okay my question was about network diagrams but I didn't mean that kind of netw-- actually you know what I give up" was my actual thought process, with possibly some (or many) expletives removed. So yeah, I'm not hung up on VTK much and in fact if there's a lib that avoids it altogether, that'd be A+++.
this is the worst approach to reading a serial port I have ever seen. just use pyserial
I'm agree with you but this was the least convoluted example I could come up with off the top of my head. Maybe I'll start honing the example into a better one. Thanks for your input. Edit: A question that popped into my mind that's related to your rant, what are the corresponding debits/credits for ATM transactions? I am both the creditor and the debitor in both cases, yet there's not an account id tied to my wallet. My first hunch would be there's some catchall "real world" account that gets hit with these, but that could be way off base. 
I'll be honest, the clean architecture is get me and I tend to follow the principles laid out in it, but it's taken quite a bit of trail and error to reach an understanding. It's not enough to say, "Database stuff lives here and data processing there and HTTP stuff over yonder" because you can still make a tightly coupled system that way. Your data processing stuff starts to implicitly couple to the database and allowances for the web layer start to creep into the domain. [Architecture the lost years](https://youtu.be/WpkDN78P884) explores this a bit more. It takes discipline, knowledge and experience to actually make use of the clean architecture, and that's before you have the realization that it's just a very basic prototype of *infrastructure* architecture rather than domain architecture (which looks completely different than concentric circles) 
What are you talking about...? Yes it would. Both dashes and camel-case would violate that exact passage you quoted.
Debit your account. Credit cash dispensary. Debit cash dispensary. Side effect of dispensing cash. So money taken out of your account put into cash. Cash deducted with matching credit to dispensed account
You should read the file in python. Or if this is really a serial port use `pyserial` like /u/ilikebigsandwiches suggested. Reading line by line could work, but might be more work than its worth. If you know that the GPS always produces messages of size X then you can use the read method on a file object with the number of bytes you want to read. The reason it never returns is that the `check_output` function is waiting for the EOF from the commands output. `check_output` doesn't magically produce something that can read an endless stream of data. Also, have you tried googling for someone reading this brand of GPS's data with python or some other programming language. There is probably a chunk of code you could copy from somewhere out there.
Depends. Django won't generate po files with syntax errors but it's common to end up with syntax errors for `msgstrs` at least from contributed translations and/or translation tools. Afaik, a couple of service don't do a good job of making it obvious that line breaks need to match at the beginning and end of each string. You'd end up with messed up line breaks in a Django project when using the blocktrans for example, if translators are not careful to match line breaks exactly as-is from translation strings. Even though multiple spaces don't matter in html as they'll be rendered as one, but msgfmt will nevertheless complain about it, which will get `makemessages` to complain as well. 
&gt; scrypt. Forking encouraged. Also the route you describe would probably match q pypy has a huge interpreter that must be downloaded by the client. 
Have you read the source code documentation? I suggest you read both implementations in [Python](https://github.com/luopio/py-thermal-printer/blob/master/printer.py) and the original from Adafruit for [Arduino](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Thermal-Printer-Library/blob/master/Adafruit_Thermal.cpp) to figure it out the correct settings first. In case everything is correctly configured, have you tried printing these 6 lines in a single application? Reading the docs from Adafruit, there are many things that were omitted in the Python version like the [non-hardcoded timing settings](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Thermal-Printer-Library/blob/master/Adafruit_Thermal.cpp#L39). It might be worth taking a look at the original documentation.
Someone needs to change/amend pep8 so that module names arentwrittenlikethis
If you're on Linux, you can check out inotify to watch the file/directory.
I ended up figuring it out, with the Pi3 I had to use serial port ttyS0 as ttyAMA0 is like unusable due to Pi3's built in Bluetooth. But so I edited the /boot/config.txt to make it so the Bluetooth no longer occupied that serial port completely (I think that's what that line did) and then I could use ttyAMA0 and I haven't had it bug out since! For future reference for anyone using the mini thermal printer with a Pi 3

I think you need subclass ZipFile and add a writefp method, just copy write method and do some minor change.
Interesting article about statistical significance in scientific research, but only related to Python in that the author provides some code at the end to illustrate his arguments.
 def decorator_thing(func): @functools.wraps(func) def wrapped(*args, **kwargs): # whatever logic here # IF you need to call func, do it here return Whatever return wrapped @decorator_thing def foo(): pass functools.wraps preserves all metadata of the function (including doc strings) 
First I've heard of PyDev, how does its code completion compare to Jedi? I'm curious because I've been having issues with packages like Numpy in Jedi, and it looks like the project hasn't been maintained much lately (the Github issue about numpy, scipy, etc has been open for more than a year) 
Following pep8 would give py_codestyle and py_docstyle, but that - arguably - doesn't really help readability given that the py* prefix is used left and right for everything Python.
&gt; You seem to be under the impression that the VTK problems I'm dealing with are Windows related, they're not You should say that earlier. Most people have trouble installing VTK are on Windows. &gt; there don't seem to be any prebuilt versions of VTK7 You can still use anaconda...it's not a Windows only thing. &gt; the documentation ranges from 'indifferent' to 'passive-aggressive', The documentation is largely autogenerated. The software is free. It's hardly passive aggressive. &gt; the community seems nonexistent The mailing list is amazingly helpful. &gt; I saw some amusing inquiries on the mailing list whether there's a boycott of IRC due to nobody showing up on the channel How many times are you willing to answer the same question? Email is so much easier and it's searchable. You're fighting install issues, understanding the documentation issues, and unfairly blaming the package. You expect them to help you in real time on IRC? That's asking a lot. It's an incredibly powerful package and unfortunately that means you have to drink from the fire hose. I run an open source project. I get complaints the software doesn't work on Python 2.6 or other ridiculous versions of numpy/scipy/VTK. Helping someone get all that set right without reinstalling their Python is a challenge, and one I usually fail on. Installation is hard. Installation is harder when the end user doesn't know what they're doing. My open source project intentionally avoids install issues because there are 1000 different combinations that my team can't realistically check. That's why there's an install guide. Give them some credit. It's an amazing open source project and it's free. Hearing people complain about a free tool is irritating. Yes, it has a learning curve. Deal with it.
Yes, returning func without wrapping it will return a reference to the same function. You need to decorate the wrapped function with wraps in order to "trick" python into thinking that the two functions are one and the same. https://docs.python.org/2/library/functools.html#functools.wraps
The author also needed someone to proofread that article too, there's a lot of spelling and grammar mistakes. You should always do code reviews and prose reviews because mistakes are common in both.
Maybe what you want to do is assign "main" to the function's __module__ attribute? func_name.__module__ = 'main' ???
So this makes a lot of sense and I thought it'd work and when I saw that it didn't I went to the source and now I realize I'd have to change func.\_\_code__.co_filename which is where it get's the filename's value. I think it's hopeless in this case then. 
Well, given that I haven't really worked with Jedi, it's hard to compare... What I can say is that code completion works well for me (given some limitations due to the dynamic nature of Python). Also, you can give type-hints in the form of docstrings and comments in the code (such as #: :type foo: Foo) for things that it can't discover (such as parameters) -- http://www.pydev.org/manual_adv_type_hints.html has more details... latest versions also deal with compound types (such as list(str)). Another form of code-completion that it gives to you is writing directly the name of a class/method and having the code-completion complete the name of the class and automatically add the import for you (see http://www.pydev.org/manual_adv_complnoctx.html). Also, usually it tries to infer the completions by statically analyzing the code, but it's also possible to ask it to analyze some code dynamically for a library (see the "forced builtins" entry in http://www.pydev.org/manual_adv_type_hints.html)... As a note, numpy should enter here for proper analysis (although in this case it's already auto-configured for you).
I am not sure I get the comment about need to review code, as it runs fine. Are you thinking of the non code pieces in the notebook?
Hello! I am the author of this article. Feel free to ask any questions or suggest topics to be covered in the next edition.
&gt; You should say that earlier. Most people have trouble installing VTK are on Windows. I should have, my bad, admittedly. &gt; You can still use anaconda...it's not a Windows only thing. Thing is, I don't have control of the target environment this is gonna run on, apart from b eing able to pip. Hence, partly, my mention of virtualenvs. &gt; The mailing list is amazingly helpful. I will admit this is my personal gripe, but the web UI for their mailing list (and mailing lists in general, I noticed) is borderline unusable. Or I might be too dense to use it effectively. Bit of column A and B I suppose. You mention that &gt; The documentation is largely autogenerated. But at the same time, &gt; How many times are you willing to answer the same question? If it's so common an issue, then why _not_ add it to the documentation? While we're on the subject of the doc, I saw that VTK7 is boasting its Python 3 compatibility. This is scarcely reflected in the docs, _as far as I can tell_, for which the documentation focuses more on CMake, with the Python part being largely, if not entirely, absent. Again, feel free to set me straight on this because, like I said, running plain old `make -j$howeverMany` results in the build failing on... twisted, of all things. &gt; get complaints the software doesn't work on Python 2.6 or other ridiculous versions of numpy/scipy/VTK. That is a bit of a strawman argument though, isn't it? I'm not wishing for compatibility with long-obsolete version of Python - on the contrary! Especially since, again, they seem to be quite proud of being on the cutting edge, pythonways. Upon reviewing I realize the text might not carry the fact I'm not being hostile, just bitter with VTK, and for that confusion, I apologize as this was unintended.
What about hack with frames? sys._getframe().f_back.f_locals["valid_json"]
Thank you ! Now copy that in your readme ;)
I wasn't saying the code was bad, I was trying to draw a parallel between code reviews and prose reviews, in that developers think code reviews are great and there are a lot of tools out there specifically for that purpose, but a blog post, documentation, or whatever isn't scrutinized as much.
[PDFMiner](https://github.com/euske/pdfminer) might be a good starting point with which I had a reasonable degree of success, though I imagine you should _probably_ expect some issues with the tables. They may look nice and simple, but there's no telling what horrors might await you, as PDF shares an apparently not uncommon theme of three-letter acronyms starting with P in that it's a fractal of bad design.
OK. I followed your advice, and I ran MS Word check spell on the text. Hope it captured the typos that annoyed you. Thanks for the suggestion.
Same for me
It never activates the virtualenv. So for instance when I try to install a package with pip it tries to install it system-wide and quite rightly receives "permission denied." If I make the virtualenv in the terminal and install all of my packages, it still doesn't work because it can't find any of the installed packages in the vitualenv it hasn't activated. This is true wether I make the virtualenv myself or if I use pycharm to create the virtualenv. I thought originally I had something broken in my env so I tested all of this on a fresh OS X user and fresh OS X install just to make sure I wasn't going crazy. The same projects work fine if I use the command line and edit in vim and also work just great in PyCharm 4.5 and earlier. My platform is OS X and my project is Python 3.5 installed via macports. I would love if it turns out that I am just an idiot and doing something wrong. EDIT: Here is the issue https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/oauth?state=%2Fissue%2FPY-18074 it appears some folks have found workarounds since I last checked in but it continues to be suboptimal.
Have you tried to contact jetbrains? Python on Mac is a nightmare but they are usually helpful. 
Python works great on macs. I have contacted jet brains. I mentioned that in my original comment.
That was really interesting! thanks!
&gt; it appears some folks have found workarounds since I last checked in but it continues to be suboptimal EDIT: But I will be trying to switch pyvenv. I would be overjoyed if this fixes it and I can move on with my life. 
No reason I can see. Given the way the wrapper currently works, on_post will either be called with valid json data or an exception will be raised and on_post won't be called at all. If we're being picky, you should rename valid_json here: valid_json = json.loads(body.decode('utf-8')) because you don't know at that point if it's valid. 
I just double checked with Python 3.5.1 on PyCharm5. I was able to create a virtualenv named test and using the repository manager install numpy. The editor has no problem resolving my imports. I use homebrew so if it's related to macports, I can't test it. Maybe someone else with macports will chime in.
In the FAQ it says ' Basically You need to root the device, remove systemUI package, add some lines to the xml configuration, and You Are Done. So what does that mean?
Implementation magic and breaks encapsulation.
Good luck!
AccountFetcher is just an interface to some way of getting accounts. Could be database, external API, in memory dictionary. It's just a blackbox that spits accounts when given an id. Probably raises an error when it can't find an account. Caches are good. However, I'm not sure what you mean by "takes a few seconds to compute...store the result somewhere". Do you have a more concrete example I could look at?
Starting with 2016.1, all JetBrains IDEs require Java 8 to run.
Well it looks bad for the support team to have something submitted and even assigned for a long time, but not confirmed and "open".
Lol, what other 3-letter acronyms are you referring to?
For example, if there's a function `get_data()` that takes a while to run, I should do this: module1.py: def get_data(): if not CACHE['data']: data = ... # some expensive computation CACHE['data'] = data return CACHE['data'] module2.py: def do_something(): data = module1.get_data() ... def do_something_else(): data = module1.get_data() ... main.py: def main(_): module2.do_something() module2.do_something_else() In the code above, I cache the data and the dependency is explicit. Instead, I did this: module1.py: def get_data(): data = ... return data module2.py: def do_something(data): ... def do_something_else(data): ... main.py: def main(_): data = module1.get_data() module2.do_something(data) module2.do_something_else(data) So essentially, I'm using `main`'s local variables as the cache. Also, there's still a dependency between the modules, but they're implicit now. I ended up having too many local variables and I'm passing around too many values. For testability, I can mock `module1` or inject it.
If you are using Pycharm, you can do this as a file watcher. 
It's usually bundled into the application. 
I feel like this is a FAQ, but I guess I don't see it on the side there. I've seen many webhosts have instructions on how to host Python--that's probably a good clue as to their level of support. Do you already have a webhost picked out or currently in use? Webfaction, DigitalOcean, PythonAnywhere, Heroku...all options with good instructions and tutorials to look through.
*sorry for spelling it as pythin, I didn't notice that error. Here is my current code: wordlists=['hello'] filenames=['hello.txt'] filecounts = {} for filename in filenames: counts = {} filecounts[filename] = counts with open(filename) as f: words = [word.lower() for word in line.split() for line in f] for word in words: counts[word] = counts.get(word,0) + 1 I get this error: FileNotFountError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'hello.txt the file is on my desktop, it says some text... how do i get it to read the file?
Just leaving this here https://pypi.python.org/pypi/left-pad/0.0.3

I can't get tox to work with remote interpreters :(
&gt; Or, if you want to reinvent the wheel, go ahead and try to do it with the standard library Brain explodes.
(Warning: rant/review ahead. If you're a PyCharm user, please disregard. You have your reasons for using PyCharm, and reading this will probably just frustrate you.) I downloaded the free edition of 2016.1 to see if it's any better than last time I tried. Once I clicked "Skip" and "OK" and "Close" enough times, I finally got to a window that looked like it could edit a Python file. It says "Drop files here to open", so I tried dragging a Python file there. Nothing happened. I tried other files, and nothing seems to work. It's one of the 5 things on the opening screen -- did they not test all 5? This seems like a pretty basic feature. Bizarrely, it also doesn't seem to support any standard keyboard shortcuts, like command-O to Open, command-F to search, or command-W to close. It has a File -&gt; Open... menuitem, and command-O doesn't do anything else (and likewise for the others). It's like they just decided to remove some common shortcuts for fun. Also rather shocking: you can change the color theme, but you have to restart the application for it to take effect. Not a good sign. I wonder what else requires a restart. I don't think I've seen an application do that in 10 years, and definitely not for something as trivial as changing the color. I thought I'd try looking at some other files, so I opened a CSV file (using the little clicky thing in the corner), and saw ... plain text. I searched on the web and found that being able to edit CSV files requires the Professional Edition ($200) with the "Database Tools and SQL" extension. I tried opening a Ruby file in my project, and it says "*.rb files are supported by IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition" ($500). Do I need to buy a different IDE for each file type I want to open? Apparently so: I looked for Clojure support, and that's another plugin (Personal license: $100). I never thought I'd say this, but this makes Emacs look like a native application. Drag-n-drop works, color themes update right away, and command-O lets me open a file. Plus, I can edit Python and Ruby and Clojure and CSV files (as tables!) and pretty much every other kind of file I've ever run across. I confess I don't understand the reason for PyCharm. With Emacs (or other editors like Vim or Atom), I have one tool that I can use for everything, and extend it as needed, and there's a huge community of people doing just that. I have no problem with paying for useful tools (I'm using several paid applications right now, in fact), but with the Jetbrains stuff, I feel like I'm being nickel-and-dimed for feature support, and it's not even clear to me how it's any better than existing free tools. Once I learn how to use a feature in Emacs, I can use that with (almost) any language, while in PyCharm, different languages are often supported only in entirely different programs, with clearly different interfaces. Instead of rewarding my learning with being able to apply it in other contexts, I'm rewarded with getting charged more money. I don't consider myself a top programmer, but whenever I read interviews with folks like Guido/Linus/Stroustrup, they tend to talk about Emacs and Vi a lot, so these fancy expensive IDEs don't seem to matter much when it comes to actually producing good working software.
&gt; I am still on 4.5 and wondering why I paid for a new license. Eclipse/PyDev are free and dont have these issues.
It's a joke. They even put it right there in the description. &gt; Or, if you want to reinvent the wheel, go ahead and try to do it with the standard library &gt;&gt;&gt; s.rjust(len(s) + 2, '+') '++abc'
Webfaction is pretty awesome. They a nice mix of VPS and shared web host. I have full terminal (SSH + SFTP) access so I can also use them as my git host and I can run Python scripts easily (though nothing I do with Python is webfacing). But, I can also use them just as a webhost without dealing with the complicated set up, hardening, or name servers (for multiple domains). I've been very happy with them so far. (and I have zero affiliation other than as a customer)

For the joke to be complete, the setup.py would need to pull in half of the Node.js stack. Just because.
If you are interested in Shiny for Python, and want Numpy and Pandas support, you really should look at Bokeh: http://bokeh.pydata.org. The gallery page has some server-based examples that have pure python callbacks, triggered by widgets and interactions on the plots: http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html#gallery
Thank you for your response! This is exactly what I was wondering. Great answer.
Its a heavily sarcastic model poking fun at the whole NPM fiasco. In case you have heard, recently the developers of Kik asked NPM to transfer the name of a repository called Kik to them instead of another developer. That developer rage quit and deleted all of his modules, including one called left-pad. Left-pad was apparently a dependency in thousands of modules, despite it being 17 lines. This is a joke post asking why the fuck you ever need a third party module to do something so fucking basic, and as you can see in the description it says, "Make sure you add it as a dependency to your next project" to make fun of idiots that ever used that repository instead of just including the function in-line.
npm install -g write-my-code-for-me
Whoever wrote this, hilariously, misunderstood what `left-pad` does. The `len` argument isn't how many characters to add - it's a minimum of how long the resulting string should be. In other words, it's pretty much exactly the same as the `rjust` method. Yes, we can poke fun at Javascript for not having this in its standard library like Python, but this package completely misses the point.
In case you were wondering what the joke is, see https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11348798.
It's possible you're using the wrong slashes. Remember windows uses \ for directories, while *nix systems use /
Has already 169 downloads, hopefully the devs of flask, django, matplotlib, etc. include it quickly to raise stability.
? That's what I'm saying I did. Should I do "python C:\path\whatever.py"? 
Yep, using the \ slashes
I've been using pycharm since on both linux and osx with virtualenvs on both, and have never had any such issues.
But what would happen if the owner of, let's say, the requests module removed all releases from pypi for some reason? As far as I know, this is very easy to do and you can't republish a deleted package. Wouldn't this cause a disaster for pypi similar to the one that happened with npm (breaking all dependent packages with pinned dependencies)? [Edit: grammar]
(caveat: I have purchased licenses for WebStorm and PyCharm, and use them both daily, as well as IntelliJ Community Edition.) So, the whole point of JetBrains's business model is that they have a core IDE application platform, and they sell language-specific IDEs built on top of that platform. WebStorm for web techs, PyCharm for Python, RubyMine for Ruby, IntelliJ for Java, CLion for C++, etc. There's some overlap within those, because they build stuff with plugins, so multiple IDEs also get the web tech plugins, and IntelliJ as their flagship product can come with just about everything added in. As IDEs, their reason for existence is to have heavily-integrated tooling for a specific language ecosystem. For example, PyCharm comes with Python terminals, a Python debugger, knowledge of Python frameworks and formatting standards, etc. Emacs and Vim, on the other hand, are generic text editors that also have a boatload of addons created over the years. They are intended for the general use case of editing arbitrary text. People have built stuff that adds IDE-like capabilities, including language-specific tooling, but their core proposition is editing text. So, these are similar but different tools, built by different people for different core use cases. Therefore, they have differing capabilities. As for some of your specific concerns: * Can't speak to the "open file" thing. I normally handle things at the project level by creating a project for an entire directory, and work with that. * Lack of common widely used keyboard shortcuts does seem odd, but they ARE all configurable. * Searching for mentions of Java LookAndFeels and "restart" turns up http://stackoverflow.com/a/2656094/62937 , which suggests that setting a LAF should only be done on app startup. So, a restart on theme change seems reasonable. * The "plain text" appearance of a CSV file seems _entirely_ to be expected. CSV files are simply plain text - there's no actual formatting or highlighting to be applied. The "special editor" you mentioned appears to be an actual table/grid-based UI editing widget, and not any kind of syntax highlighter. And why would you expect that a Python-focused IDE would give you syntax highlighting for Ruby files? You can probably open them in plain text, but again, language specialization per IDE. The point is to have a whole lot of specialized tooling for _that language_, all in one integrated package. * Note that there _are_ free "Community" editions of some of the IDEs, particularly PyCharm and IntelliJ. These offer good support for the core language capabilities, but don't include the web language plugins or specialized support for the various major frameworks for each language (Django, Flask, Spring, GWT, etc). * Sure, the more advanced capabilities require purchasing a license, but they're worth it. In my case, WebStorm's parser actually groks complex code in Javascript, which is a very dynamic language. "Find Usages" actually gives me very accurate search results, not just matching strings. And PyCharm's debugger is fantastic. Even more than that, the "Remote Debugging" capability allows me to sit at my Windows box, connect to a remote Linux system, and debug a Python service running over there. Totally worth every penny for that alone. Ultimately, it seems like you're really comparing apples and oranges, and wondering why your orange comes in sections and doesn't have a core. All that said, if Emacs works for you, great! I never got into the "heavily customize one text editor" approach myself - I've always preferred to use whatever IDE is most appropriate. 
 &gt;Having signatures would be nice, at least you wouldn't download the new owner's modules w/o some kind of error/warning. Relevant: https://github.com/pypa/twine/issues/157 and https://caremad.io/2013/07/packaging-signing-not-holy-grail/ &gt;Does pypi allow people to relinquish module names, and others to then snap them up? Yes, it does. (Source: I am a pypi package owner and see the options for that on the web interface)
&gt; to make fun of idiots that ever used that repository instead of just including the function in-line Well the reason I include `left-pad` as a dependency in my project is because I want to make sure I automatically get the security updates, should any vulnerabilities be found... /s
You make a fair point, but really, focusing on whether the package actually does what `left_pad` does (or did) *is actually* missing the point!
But is it webscale?
I wonder why it's just `left_pad`. Where is `right_pad`? It certainly belongs in same package. This so highlights sadness of js/node and their packages...
This seems like a good time for us to remember to [help keep the PSF running](https://www.python.org/psf/donations/).
Actually, your example doesn't do what NPM's left-pad would do. The actual equivalent would be: &gt;&gt;&gt; "{0:+5}".format("abc") (IIRC, going off memory here)
you gotta sudo if it's global
root shell all the time bruh. crushin' it 
That is god damn hilarious. Very quick parody to the left-pad npm article.
Holy shit 
&gt;I finally got to a window that looked like it could edit a Python file Pycharm works much better as an IDE with projects instead of random files from anywhere in my experience. &gt;Bizarrely, it also doesn't seem to support any standard keyboard shortcuts, like command-O to Open, command-F to search, or command-W to close. Other than the cmd+O to open (which I don't need due to the point above) all others are there and work as you described them. &gt;I searched on the web and found that being able to edit CSV files requires the Professional Edition ($200) with the "Database Tools and SQL" extension. It's 89 eur the first year, you're looking at the company pricing probably which is more expensive. And no, you can edit the files themselves but you will not get advanced features like auto complete, etc. &gt;Do I need to buy a different IDE for each file type I want to open? Apparently so No. If you use pycharm you have support for multiple languages, however you can also buy IDE ultimate and then install free plugins that allow you to work with python, java, clojure, etc in IDEA. You don't have to buy IDE that is focused around one language for every language you want to use, you can, but you don't have to. And IDEA Ultimate is 149 eur not $500. And 249 eur for every single product they offer if you want to use different IDEs for different languages.
