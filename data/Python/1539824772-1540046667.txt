I'm not a fan of the book. You can [read my critique here](https://medium.com/dunder-data/python-for-data-analysis-a-critical-line-by-line-review-5d5678a4c203). I'm extremely biased so take my word with a grain of salt. I actually don't like Pandas very much either as its one of the least Pythonic libraries I've ever used. 
&gt;I'm really proud of it. you should If you want to go to the next level in automation I recommend you to look a bit into Autohotkey
How can you betray C? Thats a sin. 
Even in a VM you're going to need a VirtualEnv because the last thing you want to do is break, say, `yum` in order to get your own app working. What we should all be striving for, however, is real isolation using containers. virtualenvs are just the poor man's version of that right now ("ugh kubernetes/openshift is a pain to set up if you're not going to use a cloud service provider for everything").
So the first thing I see looking at this code is you really need to break down the pieces of code you've copied and pasted into small methods that you can call in place of copypasta overload. Some of them can be parameterized (for example, the tab key followed by 0.1 or 0.2 - make the number a parameter). Secondly, break the larger pieces into smaller methods and name them according to what they're doing. All that being said, nicely done! It feels good, don't it? 
I just published a couple libraries that help you avoid `sudo pip install` as well: [pipx](https://github.com/cs01/pipx) and [create-python-package](https://github.com/cs01/create-python-package). They are Python 3.6+ only and use `venv` (the modern equivalent to `virtualenv` that ships with Python3). I wrote a [blog post](https://medium.com/@grassfedcode/bringing-some-of-javascripts-packaging-solutions-to-python-1b02430d589e) about it .
&gt; PEP 517 Awesome! Do we know if pip is yet so we can stop writing requirements.txt files?
Or get used to deploying in containers
ocr arent good enought in most case, as an account i csnt make data entry error
and it is ridiculously easy to use too ``` python3 -m venv myenv source myenv/bin/activate ```
Yes but it is unnessary complexity if it’s not necessary, we’d be “losing time”. The easiest solution is always the best, although it doesn’t lead to the most learning
The article does not mention virtual environments even once, but nice write up. I like them too.
Tuple refers to a specific data structure which is similar but different from a list in python. Mainly, you cant change it after you create it, so it’s main use is passing data. Check out the built in tuple class. * is an operator that unpacks an iterable like the pep said. It has nothing to do with the tuple other than the fact that a tuple is an iterable so you can use it to unpack a tuple.
Did you have any knowledge of any other coding language at all before this? Or you're been coding for the first time a week ago?

I'm not exactly sure what that is so I googled it: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-swap-space-on-ubuntu-16-04 &gt; Although swap is generally recommended for systems utilizing traditional spinning hard drives, using swap with SSDs can cause issues with hardware degradation over time. Due to this consideration, **we do not recommend enabling swap on DigitalOcean or any other provider that utilizes SSD storage**. Doing so can impact the reliability of the underlying hardware for you and your neighbors. This guide is provided as reference for users who may have spinning disk systems elsewhere.

DictReader might be my single most used standard library function.
You need to be using a virtual environment.
This is literally parts of my job as well, we have a security platform that spits out Csvs and I also need to load these into Excel or a database. I'm going to look into this! Thanks
Thanks, I am on windows....for now so we will see how that goes. Gotta start somewhere I guess. 
Its called machine learning son. 
&gt; It will manifest in lots of really small ways with no explanation. I mean, I guess if you really hosed it. Seconding this. I broke my system Python so bad that any time I was using the regular old Bash shell and mistyped a command, I'd see a Python error, instead of the usual 'command not found' message. It was pretty funny.
How do they figure this out?? I just started python on Sunday. And what is a loT device?
It's not on this list http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html =P
Nice work, needs some improvement but of course other people have already covered that :p I work a lot with python too, sometimes for data entry, sometimes for really stupid stuff. Take my morning routine for example: each morning i check 3 monitoring tools and fill out my time tracking in my OneNote. I wrote a script (also using pyautogui) to open my browser, navigate to those links, and then open my OneNote and write the day of the week and the fact that i checked those tools. I come in, start the program, and go refill my water bottle. About a minute later i come back and everything is set up for me :)
This comment should be a blog post. Great insight. I use Java for work but use Python for side projects. Virtual environments make working with pip dependencies SO much simpler. It’s easy to fall into the system python trap though as there’s a lot of bad advice and older material on the web that uses `sudo pip install`. Fine for you as a single developer maybe, much more difficult to run the same app on multiple machines or servers without venv or pipenv to ensure consistency.
I'm far from an expert with this stuff, but I believe swap will put data that should go into memory, on the disk, so yeah providers won't like that cause you're wearing out their SSDs. But enabling swap will probably help. I remember my old wordpress site would always have it's database go down. I enabled swap and it stopped. Idk for sure though, just a suggestion.

That’s fair, I may have had that first thought as well, but I got into coding when I was about 12(now 18) with many gaps in between (more or less a beginner) so I may just not get that beginner excitement since I’ve started so many times. 
When I learned to view Python as a tool in a broader toolchain, rather than a Swiss army knife.
A begginer in Python. When i wrote a script that logged me in into my gmail account and sent a email, i was so proud i sent 10+ emails from my testing email to my real email 
That’ sounds like a pretty sweet program! I think that’s close to what I need to do to get that feeling, and by “that” I mean a program that interacts with something that isn’t just terminal and the user and wipes all data once done running. 
Best of luck!
How long into python did it take before you wrote this? 
Where's the monkey patch, Lebowski?
Now do it in C.
I would never take online courses.
How else would you advise learning then? I am enrolled to go to college for computer science in the spring, but I don’t want to sit around with a finger up my butt, when I know I can be learning this. 
I came here to say this. This way, you get the OS and python and all the other dependencies exactly like production.
Typical magic thinking. Linux is there for its users to learn it, understand it, modify it. These qualities is why it was written in the first place. And now, what this blog post is essentially saying is: "don't touch it, don't try to understand what you are doing, it's all magic of a degree you will never be able to grasp". The reference to PHP is a tell-tail sign of this kind of thinking, I guess.
Fuck pipenv. Get off my lawn.
 I said books and coding real stuff you are interested in is better. I learnt Java when I was a little sperm at the age of 14. I already had ideas of what I wanted to do so I just threw myself in the shithole and started coding and reading. Having a project in mind was what kept me motivated to learn. &amp;#x200B; I briefly checked their prices and it seems they will charge 20 bucks per month. I also saw a course of Python for 9 weeks for 199 bucks which is just crazy. Books written by gods are just 35 bucks at most on Amazon. I dont know much about codeacademy, so I dont know if you keep the courses once you are no longer pro for example. I also knew how to program already when I tried Python so besides syntax I did not have to learn much which means I can not recommend you good books on Python. &amp;#x200B; One thing I do know if that I had to learn C++ for example I would rather pay 35 bucks for one of Bjarne books than pay any online course of 199 or pay 20 bucks each month. Just as an example.
 &gt; then they really suck unless you understand them in just as much hairy detail as you would need to understand a local deployment. Well, while I agree that vitualenvs are way overrated, it IS much simpler to fix a broken virtual env: simply because, you can just wipe it out and try to build from scratch. Which is not an option with system python.. 
Alright you bastard, I did it in pure C too. Editing my results above.
I ran into a bit of trouble with this when trying to create a virtualenv with a python 3.5.3 that i had installed from source to check version compatibility. Turned out that the python 3.5.3 from source did create the virtual env *but* did not create pip afterwards while trying with the python3 that you get from an apt get python3 did setup a virtual env with pip as expected. Trying virtualenv -p &lt;path to python3.5.3&gt; failed too. Quite annoying and i couldn't find an easy workaround.
God bless you, and Ritchie. 
Finished editing, but just so you don't miss it, the pure C version was slower than the typed Cython version.
About a week i would said. I'm reading Automating the boring stuff with python, made it to Chapter 11 (skipped a few but was really interested in web scraping) and at the end there is a suggestion to make something similar to what i did.
I mean, `pipenv shell ` accomplishes the same thing as sourcing the venv activate script. 
*Me looking at UI*: "Eww what a bad job. Looks like early 2000s software cracks" Reads "I was going for that early 2000's software crack vibe." *Me:* Oh. Good job in that case
I used the cProfile library to make a decorator that produced the profiling report on the python results. If I had to guess, I would wager the way I did it in python has more overhead than the way I did it in C. But to your question about subtraction, once the ticks have been recorded, the time required to compute the timing doesn't really matter, even if it took 5 seconds to subtract the two times from each other, the time recorded is still the time recorded.
Looks good! I would maybe say that instead of having to write pyatuogui. When you import pyatuogui instead of Import pyatuogui Do From pyguiauto import * Works the same just means you can write Click() Instead of pyatuogui.click() May save some time
Would it be possible to search for them using regex? I am dealing with those kinds of data pieces too but found they can be picked up by their common attributes like length or same letters/numbers etc. 
Is virtualenv the recommended way of making python environments? I've been using conda envs
Good for fundamentals, but you should start to code asap, so you are confronted with real world Problems . 
It's also used for unpacking tuples and in other cases where you're not interested in the result. # You don't care about y. x, _, z = get_coords() # You don't care about the result. _ = get(url)
I learned an amazing algorithm for this yesterday! You can arrange numbers 1-9 on a 3x3 grid in a magic square, ie every 3 in a row adds up to 15. Then all you have to do is pick 3 spaces that sum to 15 and you win. The AI becomes super simple, as does win detection, and you don't have to know anything spacially about what's been played, just the numbers each space corresponds to. Here's a little writeup I found : http://ohboyigettodomath.blogspot.com/2015/05/tic-tac-toe-as-magic-square.html

You can further abstract this as a function that takes in an operation and number of times it needs to repeat as arguments. ``` def do_op(op_name, reps): for _ in range(reps): pyautogui.press(op_name) ``` Then use it as `do_op('enter', 6)` and in many more locations :)
Are you the author? I vaguely remember your reddit username from my post a while back regarding pipenv being beta
I see its primary use as avoiding mistakes later on. If you don't use a dash for an unused result, you may use that name later thinking it means something else (because you bound that name to a be value but accidentally had a typo) and this kind of stuff creates nightmare logic errors.
Did you compile the C version with optimization turned on?
No, I don't think you can automate GUIs with Excel, but you can build GUIs in the RAD way, graphically (dragging and dropping controls). Python is really a nice tool and I use sometimes it at the office (to treat csv, kml, dxf files to share data between Excel, Qgis and Autocad). What I mean is that, if you haven't admin rights on your professional PC, that's not so easy to use Python, and if your professional world is very Microsoft (and Autodesk) centric, I think Excel and Vba are a good choice, as you can automatize the boring stuff but also interact with word, excel, Autocad, ms project and so on. And it' s more easy to share (or to delegate to other people), and on the top of that the saving, exporting and cancelation functionalities are yet implemented. ... But Python is ruling as a scripting language in major must to have softwares as Qgis, Blender, and others. Python is supported by Ms in Visual Studio, VS Code, and planned if I believe a post I've read recently to be used as a scripting language in Ms Office. So keep learning and using Python, that's why we are strolling in that subreddit. 
I don't use sudo pip but I certainly don't see an issue with pip+venv.

/r/learnpython Have you learned what objects are? In Python, everything from functions, integers, even classes are all objects. 
You may see the same output if you ran it from the python interpreter in interactive mode. 
A few good ideas indeed and the interface looks clean. But the code certainly looks too young for me to rely on it yet.
Cython is faster because they remove some bounds checking.
Heyy I just knew about this. TIL. Thanks 
Do you have a video of this? Sounds amazing! 
They are all geventable.
Pfft, REAL programmers use a magnetized needle and a steady hand to install Python packages. But really - why the hell are people so harsh on pipenv? If you don't like it, don't use it. Easy as that.

Maybe I shouldn't feel proud of the argparse hack I wrote today.
Rust is doing it right with Cargo. Is there a Python version of that?
Basically, you have an animal class. The animal class has 4 attributes and you have two methods. When you utilize that set_name method, you set the an instance of the animal’s class to the specified name. When you use get_name, you get returned the value of the instance’s name.

You are right, I have edited the post to mention it.

It's measured by looking at things like deep code (vs separate functions), a large number of arguments, lots of if-elif...--else statments, long lines, many lines, too many class functions, etc. It tries to say how maintainable your code is. The thing is you probably already know if you wrote it. The hack parts matter more if they're in the critical path. If you can't fix a bug, add a feature, or make a change without it being hard or scare you that you'll introduce a bug unintentionally, your code probably sucks. If your tests catch the error and it's easy, it's fine. If you don't have tests, well...
Well sorry but nobody from /r/learnpython will explain something about the implementation details of CPython or others python implementations. &gt;Subreddit for posting questions and asking for general advice about your python code. As I said in my post (have you read it?), I don't want advice for this code, I want explanations about the memory optimization in Python and what the specification of the language has to say about it.

 $ pacman -Qq | wc -l 2164 How do you install packages without root? I can't imagine that you can, unless you're using something like nix, junest, or 0install.
I'm guessing your company's software doesn't provide an API
Yes that really is amazing ! What a creative idea !
A class is like a template where you have properties and methods used to group data as in your situation you need to store information about an animal, instead of having 4 independent values to store them you define a class having these as properties. It’s helpful as if you would do it the first way your code will become difficult to manage if you have to store/manipulate data for multiple animals. So you define a class having the properties required and then you can instantiate as many times required but note that you can limit the amount of times you can instantiate a class(eg singleton,... which you will learn later) In a class you can also define methods. There are special methods which are used to access properties known as setters and getters, in this case set_name and get_name are example of them.

I'm a slightly confused newer python user. I've always called pip (or pip3) as a non-sudo command. Is that approach fundamentally different from the suggestion in the article?
&gt;Data science is mostly for a regular job where you work in a physical office. As someone who has spent much of the last year doing freelance Data science, this isnt' necessarily true. There is actually quite a bit of data science involved in things like social media analytics or marketing analytics, financial modeling. Data science is a lot like big data in that its a term thrown around alot, few can accurately describe what it is, those who can see its applications everywhere.
If you do anything that could be improved by automation - particularly in generating visualizations or insights from data - python is a great tool. Easy to learn, quick to get something up and running, and it plays well with most of the other technologies that are essential in your role.
Don't forget about this one guys: ``` from functools import lru_cache @lru_cache() def fibo(num): if num == 0: return 0 elif num == 1: return 1 else: return fibo(num - 1) + fibo(num - 2) ```

 $ pacman -Qq | wc -l 1218 Dunno how you manage to have twice the amount of packages installed globally. In any case, I never use `pip` or `npm` with root, since you don't have to. Install for the current user or the current project. There's been problems enough with some buggy code entering a package installer, thus deleting or installing way more than it should. Lots of problems can be prevented if you don't run anything as root that doesn't absolutely have to. 
It is just a preference. If I am starting a project, I always add both Pipenv and requirements file. They can use whatever they want.

Because you choose to trust some packages, doesn't mean you have to trust everything. If it don't need to be installed as root, I don't give root access. 
Then according to Zen of python, half the libraries on the internet should be non existent. There are so many times, I wished there was one obvious way to do something, yet I had to look up the internet for hours. What I mean is that, the Zen of python is about programming in python. Not about which tool you use to download your packages.
Thanks for doing this writeup! I learnt a lot from this. Two questions: 1. Can you build your cython script once, and then import it into a python script? 2. How does this compare to PyPy?
Tbh, way more than half the libs is useless crap. If people could stop badly reinventing the wheel when it's completely unecessary, that would be great. The Zen of Python is wider than the way you code, it's about how to get shit done with Python. That includes managing dependencies and work environment. There is a reason why recents languages offer their tool for that with well thoughts standard (like cargo with rust), it avoids the mess we are currently in to manage dependencies in Python. Pipenv is just entropy added to that mess.
These are fair arguments. /u/cr4d's argument is just plain mean against the developers and contributors (245 according to their GitHub project) spending their personal time on trying to improve the current situation. You can't argue with the Zen of Python to *not* create something new. 
Yep, definitely. I’m working on my own tiny programming language now, written in pure Python, and, as things start to work a little bit, it becomes pure pleasure to run some code written in my language. Like, yes, this stuff (somewhat) works! (Let’s run the same thing again now).

For 1, you definitely can. It will compile to a 'shared object' (.so on linux or .pyd on windows) that can then be imported just like a normal .py module. AFAICT the compiled one is imported preferentially if you have the .py(x) and .so next to each other. But it does have to compiled separately for each architecture (for linux / windows, 32 / 64 bit etc). As a bonus, i found the compiled module is recognised and imported by Pyinstaller just like a normal imported module too, so you don't have to bundle the files needed like with some .dlls.

Alright, apologies for the wrong format and subreddit. I was desperate hahaha. Will delete soon 
This code breaks on fibo(500). If you implement your own cache with a dict, it can go deeper.
&gt;Seriously, the sooner you start using virtual environments for everything, the better your life will be assuming you can come out on top of the hours over hours of debugging while setting it up
Creates a cache for function calls for certain arguments, up to a certain memory limit. So, say, fibo(1) is called, this is saved in a hash: fibo(1) = 1. Next time the function is called it will look up if the result has been stored already. This is specially relevant for the naive fibonacci function because each value will be called many, many times.
There is a generative approach to an answer: implement a solution in Python. profile it while not acceptable timing: Implement the most critical part in a language more suited for that specific part. profile the new solution If you end up with a solution where a large part of the original code has been replaced, you have a candidate. Being able to answer the question before going through these steps takes some experience.
How this is compared to pipenv?
Why do you need syntax from Python 3 in legacy code? Sounds like a recipe for disaster. 
The disaster have already happened People are lugging aroung 500kLOC monsters without a test suite. They don't dare port their code, because they have no way of verifying that its still correct. Adding dataclasses to that mess will not make it measurably more disastrous in my opinion. 
Isn't it just a matter of increasing maxsize on lru_cache? As in @lru_cache(maxsize=512) should solve it no? Or is it another issue?
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eCZjHGZ-ewE There is a lot of stuff blocked out because it was and old video that people kept asking to see, but I had personal information in the video that needed to be covered. I updated the script a bit after that video to be more responsive, smooth, and to take input from the laser pointer’s buttons. I don’t know why, but I didn’t think to take another video and I don’t own the laser pointer and the original owner wanted it back, so I can’t show the newer version. .-.
Reconstructing with lots of pain...
I just tested with the same but with Numba instead of Cython. ``` from numba import jit, int64 def fibo(num): if num == 0: return 0 elif num == 1: return 1 else: return fibo(num - 1) + fibo(num - 2) %timeit fibo(30) # 31.3 s ± 317 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each) @jit def jfibo(num): if num == 0: return 0 elif num == 1: return 1 else: return jfibo(num - 1) + jfibo(num - 2) %timeit jfibo(30) # 701 ms ± 4.06 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each) @jit(int64(int64)) def jifibo(num): if num == 0: return 0 elif num == 1: return 1 else: return jifibo(num - 1) + jifibo(num - 2) %timeit jifibo(40) # 698 ms ± 3.47 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each) ``` Thus, it was a ~45x speedup by using Numba instead of pure Python. These experiments are probably not comparable to yours because of hardware differences, but I'd still say its a compelling argument to try Numba before Cython because it doesn't involve the compilation step. Note though, that Numba supports a subset of the Python syntax, whereas Cython supports a superset of the Python syntax. So Numba is therefore not always applicable.
I was really looking for someone to code inhouse league irc bot for me and couldn’t find anyone. So I thought I’d at least prototype the basics. Few nights later I did it completely, deployed it to openshift and wrote a small frontend for it. It was a moment where I said “wow, maybe I can do this for a living”. So I did. Quit school and got a job. Learning more every day on the job than in a month at school.

Can you add C compile arguments. Like I’m specifically interested if you used -Ofast
I learned how to use Docker by going through its documentation and trying to set up build environments for all kinds of stuff, but mainly SecureDrop. Learned quite a lot in the process. 
What would you suggest to someone who did that course but has not much knowledge in maths.. I'm trying to think of a simple little project to start working on
Can not remember, when I started a Django web project successfully?
I figured. I just have a really bad retention rate when learning from docs usually. More of a video learner. 
You can say the same words in many other Program Languages, that's the point. And, it's necessary for you to understand what OBJECT it is.
OP specifically utilised a non efficient Fibonacci algorithm. What you have here is a Dynamic Programming solution that runs in O(n). The optimal way to compute Fibonacci is using “Binet” formula in O(long).
Good god man...
Generally, this kind of course can help you with syntax, or less,. You should create and maintain some projects with real users to become a really Pythoner!
Started writing SWIFT MT message parsers https://github.com/kadnan/PyMTMessages
Readability is really really really important, so something in one line is not cool enough as you thought.
Did you compile the C code with optimization (-O3)?
You created a universe!
Simple. Because at some point that will break at least one of your programs that depend on the package you just updated. If I could count the number of times I've seen an unexpected break because someone globally updated something, I'd have a ridiculously large number. Even if you alone are responsible for maintaining all of the software, you're human and will forget to test something which result in a gigantic waterfall of cascading shit because of what, on the surface, seems like a trivial change. 
Forking Python 2 and maintaining it -- this I understand. Adding Python 3 stuff into it -- this I don't.
Well, it mentions `pipenv` which is basically just a wrapper integrating `pip` and `virtualenv` into a single tool.
`pipenv` is the closest.

How do you make sure the timing works out? I feel you can make a guess at how long the software takes to do things, but it's never 100% correct. 
Yes
For system-wide installations, using distribution provided packeges (for example `apt-get install python-xxx` on Debian/Ubuntu) is superior in every aspect over using pip/pipenv/etc. The most important thing is that system packages get security updates, what is not the case in pip. (Yes, you can update packages in pip, but you risk that an update will turn out a major update and break your application.)
Java has something called JSP (Java Server Pages) that lets you run Java code similar to how you can embed PHP code alongside HTML/CSS in a .php file.
You're right, that's a terrible example. I'll edit it down.
How can C be slower than Cython that is suppose to compile to write C
I have tried, it is simply impossible. Best I can do is working from home in my PJ pants while on calls with boss, he never knows :)
A presentation about the packages you’ll need to use?! You need no packages - just the built-in `dict` class and the `print` function. 
I did say I know nothing at all about python tho :(
Okay thank you 😊 I'm guessing the dict class is to ass the terms and meaning should and the print function is to display the meaning of words correct? And is there like a way for me to get the words/meanings from an outside source without typing them In manually?
What if I want to throw away both y and z? Do I use x, _, _ = get_coords() or x, _, __ = get_coords()
they will be separated
Yup! Its a little tricky to set-up, but yes it does that.
Why not return `l[n]`? 
mission accomplished
Hey man thank you for taking a look. I'll look into loops. This was my first project so I am taking everyone's input for how to make this better in the future. 
There are still some big issues IMO with bootstrapping to a stable Python 3.6 (or 3.7) environment with a corresponding stable pip. In the university course I teach there have been significant issues, especially on Ubuntu 16x -- 18x, especially with respect to the native Python 3.5 install. We are using pipenv for pip + virtual environments. Once they get a stable "outer environment" we've been very happy with the ease of use and repeatability of using pipenv. But it has been a big stumbling block for students to get to that initial stage. 
What did you use to turn that stack into a single exe? And was it an installer or portable?
Here's a cool exercise: write a program that takes a piece of python code and sticks in curly braces where try would be in another language. I think you'll find it'll be fairly easy. 
I made my codeacademy account on October 5th. So I guess it is close to two weeks now. It took me a few days to sit down and focus on the lessons though. It has been a week since I started working on this program. I had done some windows and linux command line stuff. Never really anything like this. The frameworks are where its at. So many people have put in work before me to make this stuff easier to write. I was only adjusting it to what I needed. 
Yep there is plenty of code that can be condensed or even deleted all together. It would be nice to clean it all up. But maybe I'll just take little break and enjoy it for now :) Learn some other stuff and come back to tackle it. 
Upvote because of Python3.7.
Oh! I used that before to do some small stuff like add media functions to my keyboard. I completely forgot about that program. I know there are probably a million different ways to approach the problem I had, but using Python seemed fun and I am learning something new at the same time. Thanks for looking!
&gt; A year from now you will hate your former self for all those three-letter function names, oif etc. Name them for_what_they_do(). Smart. And yep there is plenty of cleanup I can do. It works for now but the whole thing needs to change. Everyone here is giving very helpful feedback. Thanks!
Pip and venv, both of which ship with any recent Python.
Have fun! 
Glad to hear! 
Thank you for posting this. I am an absolute beginner at all this, and what you've written here makes so much sense. Without your comment, I would absolutely have sudo'd everything in my ignorance, but now I'm going to try and learn how to do this properly.

Most of your problems would be fixed by calling by calling `pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt` on the dev machine. And why would your software be so dependent on a specific version of a package? Most people aren't doing anything very complicated there should be stable packages out there for you to use. Unless you of course decide to jump on board whatever is the newest hype train, but then that's the mistake is yours when then things start going wrong.
nuttt
Funny enough that’s not why I know those, I just had 2 coding classes in highschool (taught by non coders) so for web design he “taught” us html and CSS A.K.A made us read pages on w3schools so I just ended up teaching myself those two languages. And then I had a computer science class (also taught my a non coder) so before the class started I taught myself java. Never put the two together though. 
RU4RealBot?
Or -Ofast
That is actually a really cool life twist. 
True.
If you ask what fib(50) is, even with the DP version presented here it has to make O(50) calls (just look at the return statements...), so it is O(n). The dictionary look-up is not the limiting complexity.

No 
&gt; Most of your problems would be fixed by calling by calling `pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt` on the dev machine. You then send requirements.txt over to the server, run `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`, and promptly break everything else. &gt; And why would your software be so dependent on a specific version of a package? Most people aren't doing anything very complicated there should be stable packages out there for you to use. I don't understand what you're saying here at all. All software is simple, therefore bugs don't exist and you never have to update dependencies ever?
Well the beautiful if programming is that you only need to know how to add because that is the only thing the computer knows how to do. 6+ 3= 9 6 - 3 = 6 + -3 6* 3 = 6 + 6 + 6 6 / 3 = (((6 - 2) -2) -2)

Thanks. It just makes sense to build your application in a method I use in production. I built my own tooling for container automation. Just give me a dockerfile and be done.
&gt;Doesn't help im on a windows and its a pain in the ass to do just about anything on this thing. [https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) Running docker in hyper-v. Its the exact same thing as Linux, commands are the same, it also integrates with Powershell just fine. Please dont knock tools your not familiar with.
They come in as PDF's, each individually by email. I have to print them as hard copy either way. This is only a small part of my job and what I have to do with these files. Some of my other comments outline my concerns with using OCR or text recognition, etc. I don't think it is plausible but I am keeping an open mind. 
I compile my code with cython and would like to use python type annotations to optimize the compilation. What is the name of the decorator you need to decorate your functions with? This process is fairly well hidden in the cython documentation. Thanks. 
And do you know the person / machine making the pdf? Maybe 2 files could be made, a csv (to use) and the pdf for reporting. 
The answer is "yes"
That's something I had trouble with but it was just trial and error. Some of the pauses aren't perfect so it could be even faster, but it works for now. Hey even if you put half a second between each command it would still be faster than doing it by hand. 
That sounds doable and something I might look into. Thanks for the help.
Great to know! thanks!

Check out Pyinstaller. You can make your script into a single, portable executable with one command. And there are many additional badass features once you're comfortable with the basics.
I'll check it out!
Indeed, this takes 0.006 seconds to do fib(10000): def fib(n): if n in fib.cache.keys(): return fib.cache[n] else: i = max(fib.cache.keys()) while i &lt; n: fib.cache[i+1] = fib.cache[i] + fib.cache[i-1] i += 1 return fib.cache[n] fib.cache = {0: 0, 1: 1} print(fib(10000))
Mind posting your "pure python style" code?
`def SHOW(s):` `return "".join([(lambda x, y: y + "-" if x % 6 == 0 and x &gt; 0 else y)(x,y) for x,y in enumerate(s)])` &amp;#x200B; Not saying it's all that readable but it demonstrates some of the benefits of Python. 
Right on. Thanks for the info
Do you mean how does it handle importing libraries? It handles it very well, as it just generates the Python C API calls that are equivalent to the code you wrote. And that's the worst case scenario.
Nice! It feels so good. 
By the way, you're misusing the `__main__` module. `__main__.py` is used [when you run a package from the command line](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html): python -m module will run `module.py` (if it exists on the PYTHONPATH) or `module/__main__.py` if it is a package. Also, instead of repeating a half-dozen or more lines from humps.__main__ import spam for various values of spam, a better way is a wildcard import: from humps.__main__ import * and then in the `__main__` module (except don't call it `__main__` -- see above) list the names you want to be exported: __all__ = ['spam', 'eggs', 'cheese', 'aardvark', 'parrot'] Really though, you ought to move everything currently out of `__main__.py` and put it in `__init__.py`. Even the compat.py submodule doesn't really carry its own weight. It could be replaced with four lines at the top of `__init__`. try: str = unicode except NameError: pass since feature-detection is (usually) better than version checking.

Here's a python one-liner :) def show(x): return '-'.join(x[i: i + 6] for i in range(0, len(x), 6)) It doesn't exacly map to your code, but I think this is what you really needed.

Impressive, I challenge you to find the point at which performance is about equal, and then define a use-case wherein cython would not be the appropriate choice based on what you discover.
OP isn’t trying to do efficient code, but just an FYI for people looking at this, it can be optimized to use constant space rather than storing a dictionary memo of all previous values. The dependency DAG (directed acyclic graph) means a single call of `fib(n)` only depends on the two calls before it, `fib(n-1)` and `fib(n-2)`, so instead of keeping a dictionary, we only need to store two values. ` # I’m on mobile, so I’m not going to write out everything like the initial guard clauses two_back = 1 one_back = 1 for i in range(2,n): f = two_back + one_back two_back, one_back = one_back, f return f `
To what? The technical debt thing? It's a BS amalgamation of various linters that's part of some service like codacy. I think it was actually on an QuantifiedCode, which shut down.
&gt; What we should all be striving for, however, is real isolation https://xkcd.com/2044/
Finally, a `npx` for python!
Any tutorial on this. 
&gt; But not using them is guaranteed to fuck you over. Guaranteed, is it? Who do I complain to? I've been not using virtualenvs for years, and I haven't been fucked over yet. I want my money back! 
I appreciate that. Hopefully I get there soon too. I'm already seeing a lot of stuff I do daily that could be automated with Python. Long live programming!
Not on Debian packaged installs. Or at least it wasn't the last I checked. But that's pretty easy to fix by either installing pip from the OS repo or just compiling python itself. I've gotten into the habit of the latter because it makes using multiple versions easier (something I need for multi version libraries I maintain) 
have you done multiple runs (with warmup, preferably) and taking the average.
Changing a well established, working pattern that people have worked hard to put in place diminishes the work they have done, fragments the community, confuses new comers, and is just plain shitty. Helping improve pip is one thing. Working to replace it without consensus, forking it/vendorizing it (pip) with the intention of marginalizing it is rude. Python’s pre-pipenv packaging eco-system was leagues better than other languages. Trying to make it like npm for the sake of hipster douchiness (toml, etc) is just a bad case of not-invented-here syndrome. 
My biggest problem with PIP is that, there is no straightforward way to add lock file for your packages. Pipenv is not just a virtualenv, it is a virtualenv + a good dependency resolver. I am not saying Pipenv is good and I am sure it will die out but it is a step in the right direction. This is exactly how it was with PHP. There was PECL which was the standard and it was shit. Then, composer came out and no one even remembers pecl these days. It is the same reason, nowadays most people still use Yarn instead of NPM in JS environment because Yarn was and I believe still is much better than NPM (even though NPM is years ahead in comparison to PIP). NPM got locking at least a year after Yarn was created. With the rise of Pipenv, many other dependency managers came out (i.e Poetry). This is because someone got the courage to do something different for once and it worked. This is how an ecosystem evolves and improves. Python is not some kind of a religion where every PEP has to be taken as a commandment to follow.
A friend in the late 90s kept telling me I should check out this neat Python thing, so I dabbled briefly but didn't really pick it up. A couple years passed, and I gave it another more serious try. I decided I wanted to write a really compact emulator for a "six bit microcontroller." You see, the definition of a "byte" really didn't start out with 8 bits, and I really liked the idea of a system with just enough 6-bit bytes to fill a chess board, using a 6-bit address. So I wrote the emulator, a source code assembler, AND a single-stepping source-code debugger with visualizer, all within 1200 lines. That's when I felt I could really tackle problems in Python, readably and succinctly.
I wasn't being mean. Forking the work of the people that wrote pip with the intent of improving and replacing it and not contributing back to it is mean. Ignoring the hard work of the people who came before to make Python behave like another language with regard to packaging is mean. Not incrementally improving the existing ecosystem, but working to replace it wholesale is mean.

Toy examples like this are deeply misleading, and give the wrong impression about how reliable neural nets are. (Oh I'm sorry, "Deep Learning Programs", because marketing.) The problem is that this example is trained on 100% of the domain data. There are only four possible sets of inputs: 00, 01, 10, 11, and it is trained on all four of them. Ten thousand times each. (Why 10,000?) For non-trivial problems, you ought to have three sets of data: [a training set, a validation set, and a test set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_test,_and_validation_sets). Ideally they ought to be separate, *especially* the test data. Obviously with a population of only four data points, this is not the case for the XOR example. And that's why such toy examples can learn to be 100% accurate, giving a misleading impression that with just the right tuning, so can any DLP. 
Can you explain why I would want a lockfile? 
Thanks for this comment. I think there should be something on git-hub that explains this more thoroughly? I use intellij with anaconda envs. When I create a project in a new environment I have to install packages here which I have previously installed in other environments. Correct? Intellij shows a little lightbulb that offers to search for and install these packages for me. Is this a legitimate way to install in an env? 
With what you know right now, maybe you should look at sanic ( https://github.com/huge-success/sanic) and Django (https://www.djangoproject.com) . They're web server frameworks that could help you build web apps. I'd definitely learn a little Javascript first, but you can do a lot using what you've already learned in html, css, and python. Sanic is very lightweight and doesn't take long to learn, so it's quick to develop. Django is a lot more detailed and takes more time to learn, however it's used a lot professionally by large businesses. Because of the community support it has, you can build secure production level web apps with it. Quick and easy development, or robust code that might take a while to learn, pick your poison.
That’s definitely a good strategy. To build on that strategy, the next level is to think about the sub-problem dependencies. Sometimes you’ll need an entire dictionary to cache previous results, but sometimes you just need to maintain some variables.
I watched the first two videos yesterday and I really liked it. The guy is pretty good at explaining and demonstrating stuff
debian installs break up the stdlib. You need to install python3-venv.
It's top10 on the TIOBE [https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/). Both rankings have serious flaws, but someone saying that SQL is obscure (when it is main way to communicate with modern DB) is just surprising to see :P
My bad, I was looking for links to your 140k lines open source project. 
"*doing it right"* is in the eye of the beholder. Personally, I thing that having an executable script with logic to handle package installation and configuration is *doing it right*. I thought that using requirements files was doing it right but I'm coming around to using a "dev" entry *extras\_require* as a superior approach **that builds on what is already there**. Declarative packages with lock files can work but none of the approaches has been shown as general purpose over time. I personally don't have the desire to ditch setuptools, pip, and setup.py and replace it with something *new*. Cargo has a few years on it now and maybe the approach will bear fruit for rust. The real question is why doesn't cargo support python? Each programming language has it's own method of handling deployment. Python's has been an executable script named setup.py for some time now and I'm good with that.
Bit too niche and it has my name attached.

Yes, and dictionaries are not necessary here. You can use an array and that is guaranteed to be O(1) in any language worth its salt.

I've been using `pipsi` for a long time but it seems like development has slowed. That said, it still works for all cases I need without issues. I'll give `pipx` a go and see if it fits my use case.
I’d be interested to see how a version that is compiled using Nuitka would stack up against the Cython version. With Nuitka you don’t have to rewrite your program, just feed it your python program. 
Numba should also offer significant improvement in this kind of calculations. Perhaps you could compare that as well.
100,000 lol
Hear, Hear! Once you get up and running, and feel so inclined, I wouldn't mind hearing about what you've automated!
You’re not getting the first element of the two subarrays, you’re just getting the first element of the main array. Slicing syntax is: list[inclusive:exclusive]. So you’re slicing just returns the first element in the first example and the all array in second one. r/learnpython
Hey, wow thanks for this benchmark. Is there a sensible way to run Python with Cython ? (Cython wrapped with Python). What I mean: I have an application that is written in Python and makes quite a lot of calculations based on the data registered in the database. The calcucation algorithm is fairly easy to extract, as I gather the data from database and than perform the calculation. I guess I could rewrite whole procedure in Cython and ... ideally pass the data to Cython script (possibly using a separate, async thread) and wait for result. I'm not sure how to make it in a most clean way (no experience)
Absolutely: you can pull data from an online source with `urllib` (built-in) or `requests` (3rd-party). You also can retrieve it from a JSON/CSV/txt file. There are built-in packages to parse them.

Others have said you should not use Python when you need to go fast. I think that’s close to the truth. You wouldn’t use Python if your *main* goal is performance. If it’s a huge application and it’s just one part that needs to be very performant, it wouldn’t be a good idea to do the whole thing in another language if you’d otherwise do it in Python. If it’s not fast enough, you can always profile it, and if all Python optimization aren’t sufficient, you could still use Cython or implement that part in another language like Rust or C. But most of the times, Python - while other languages might more performant - is *fast enough*, and that’s what matters. Some areas where in my opinion Python definitely isn’t the best choice: - Mobile. Using native languages wins hands down here. - GUI intensive applications. Yes, there are some quite nice tools for Python GUI, but is never chose Python as the go-to language for a large desktop app. - Games.

**Block cipher mode of operation** In cryptography, a block cipher mode of operation is an algorithm that uses a block cipher to provide an information service such as confidentiality or authenticity. A block cipher by itself is only suitable for the secure cryptographic transformation (encryption or decryption) of one fixed-length group of bits called a block. A mode of operation describes how to repeatedly apply a cipher's single-block operation to securely transform amounts of data larger than a block.Most modes require a unique binary sequence, often called an initialization vector (IV), for each encryption operation. The IV has to be non-repeating and, for some modes, random as well. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

Op probably only forgot a `;` for example `python3 -m venv venv source; venv/bin/activate` :P Might need to `sudo apt-get install python3-venv` before hand on a ubuntu distro. For this magic to work!
virtualenv is good chioce
that would fix it (though i'd prob use &amp;&amp; to make sure the right hand doesn't run unless the left hand succeeds), if you look at his comment source he intended it to be separate lines: https://i.imgur.com/kDRaKaW.png
Thanks for working on improving installation. I'm wanting to migrate my company to poetry and the installation process was a blocker (could not get it installed on WSL's Ubuntu). That now works! After installation gets fixed for [Windows](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry/issues/518), I'll test to ensure it works for our use cases (cross-platform lock file unlike pip-tools; easily works with devpi).
And a recent [blog post](http://andrewsforge.com/article/python-new-package-landscape/) that apparently I can't read at work because OpenDNS says its malicious despite its healthy [hackernews conversation](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18247512).

I'm guessing you haven't actually tried this, because that's not remotely the case. This code runs in around 10ms up to recursion depth (tested up to 10k, I couldn't get recursiondepth up to 10\^5 without crashing). In fact, due to the order that the calls happen in, you can reduce the cache size to the last 3 results and still get the same performance.

Since you're asking about learning JavaScript wouldn't posting in r/learnjavascript make more sense than posting here?
The warmup time for the JIT is huge, it takes something like 1000 iterations to see changes.
Ah, you've run into the inbuilt recursion limit (set to prevent stack overflow). You can temporarily override this by `import sys` `sys.setrecursionlimit(1000)` or whatever other recursion depth you need. (Admittedly it's a bad idea to set it too high as it's there for a reason - python really isn't set up for tail-end recursion.)
Woah.... Woah... Woah.... Wait... Functions are objects. All objects in Python are dictionaries. You can just... dynamically... add... to... them... 😱🤯
If I understand everything correctly, Cython calls into the standard CPython runtime for things like integer additions. That would mean Cython supports bignum integers, so unlike C, Cython can compute fibo(100). Is that correct?
Thanks! Learning something new. :)
Pygame!
Good Eye, so just go return l[n]?
I'm noob. Thanks! I was calculating twice for no reason.
Yeah I copied his code and on `-O2` I got .90 seconds and on `-`-Ofast` I got .45 seconds, so the level of optimization really matters.
Sorry for jumping down your throat, I had thought you were talking about the speed of the algorithm, but shouldn't be make assumptions like that.
Liberal use of screenshots. One of pyautogui's best features is that you can feed it an image and get it to look for that exact collection of pixels on the screen. So like if there's a button that doesn't appear until the software is fully loaded, you can take a screenshot of that button and basically tell pyautogui don't do anything until this appears (you basically just wrap in a `while True` loop if screenshot found move on if not sleep). You just have to be careful because it's looking for that *exact* collection of pixels, so if like the corner of a dialog box unexpectedly intrudes on that area it will screw things up. I just keep my screenshots as small and tight as I can.
That's not that recent, and also less relevant and more "the python ecosystem was shit, its still a gigantic mess but we are getting there", and it was also a shameless copy of the xkcd released a few days before that article.
I’m not sure if this is considered good or bad (I’m mostly a rubyist), but it does seem pythonic and was conceptually easier for me to write.
You learn something new every day, thanks
A little bit more boilerplate on this one: #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; __global__ int do_fib(int n){ if (n &lt;= 1){ return n; } return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2); } __global__ void fib_master(int n, int* results){ int result = do_fib(n); int idx = threadIdx.x+blockIdx.x*64; results[idx] = result; int main(int argc, char**argv){ if (argc &lt; 2){ printf("N must be specified\n"); exit(1); } int n = atoi(argv[1]); int * device_results; int * host_results = malloc(64*64*sizeof(int)); cudaMalloc(&amp;device_results, 64*64*sizeof(int)); fib_master&lt;&lt;&lt;64, 64&gt;&gt;&gt; (n, device_results); cudaMemcpy(host_results, device_results, 64*64*sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice); long long sum = 0; for (int i = 0; i &lt; (64*64); i++){ sum += host_results[i]; } double avg = sum/(64*64); printf("Average fibonacci result is %f!\n", avg); return 0; } 
Have you checked out pyautogui's locateOnScreen method yet? If not, check out my response to the person you're responding to.
Not currently but i will once I get it more easy to understand and use
Oh that's really cool actually. I'll look into that. Could help with the pauses.

I would say 12-24 working hours. It likely had to do with modifying a CSV and ended up a 2 year project that worked. Outside dependencies changed and now everything is outdated, but I do plan on reviving it using AWS and SQL where possible. That will likely take another 300+ hrs though.
Something like this was used in a company I used to intern in. And that company usually goes to a lot of lengths to keep the code sane. I think it's considered a good practice

Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
Very cool!
I believe this is what he means: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/
On the scale that development happens and compared to a lot of sources out there, May is recent. I also found the document very helpful. It covered a lot of technologies relevant detail, covered a lot I hadn't heard of before, etc. It is a lot more than a text form of the relevant xkcd. And yes, I agree with the premise that the python ecosystem is in terrible shape. I've been moving away from it because of it. My hope is that poetry will continue to mature and grow in market share which will be a big help. The big issue I still have left is dependency-less install. PyInstaller and friends are a help but not a panacea.
Yeah that feature was the thing that saved the day for me. The software I'm dealing with can be very unpredictable in terms of load times and things like that. In my project folder I have a sub folder called 'screens' that's just full of all the different screenshots I need it to look for throughout the process. Then I have the following functions in my script... def wait_open_by_screenshot(fname, max_wait=600): add_to_log('Wait open by screenshot {} (max_wait = {})'.format(fname, max_wait)) s = time() while True: check_if_timed_out(s, max_wait) if pyautogui.locateOnScreen('./screens/' + fname): sleep(0.25) add_to_log('Screenshot found. Elapsed time: ' + str(time() - s)) return else: sleep(0.25) def check_if_timed_out(s, max_wait): if max_wait: if time() - s &gt; max_wait: add_to_log('Timed out after {} seconds'.format(max_wait)) timeout_handler() So then if I were to call `wait_open_by_screenshot('some_button.png')`, it will find that image in my screens folder and search the screen for it. If it finds it, the function returns and the code moves on. If it doesn't find it, it sleeps for a quarter second and then tries again. If this goes on for longer than whatever I set my max\_wait variable to (I default it to 600 seconds but I can change that to whatever I want when I call the function), it will then move on to my timeout\_handler() function, which in my case basically just kills the software, waits five minutes, and then starts over. Adding things to a log is obviously optional, but since this is something that's running when I'm not around I find it really useful to have a log of what ran when. Those all just go into txt files in another sub folder called 'logs.'
Did you know you can also make instances of your classes callable by implementing a `def __call__(self):` method?
Sweet! I am definitely going to keep this in mind

There's not unfortunately.... it seems to have difficulty launching PyInstaller... I'll look into it further. There are a couple of my programs that I was unable to get working correctly in EXE format. I'll report back here.
I have encountered optimization problems where numba helped a lot, but C still would have been faster.
There you go my friend. .text .LC0: .ascii "%d\12\0" .globl main .def main; .scl 2; .type 32; .endef .seh_proc main fib: cmp $2, %rcx jg no_ret_1 movq $1, %rax ret no_ret_1: pushq %rcx sub $1, %rcx call fib popq %rcx pushq %rax sub $2, %rcx call fib popq %rbx addq %rbx, %rax ret main: movq $10, %rcx call fib leaq .LC0(%rip), %rcx movq %rax, %rdx call printf movq $0, %rax ret .seh_endproc The argument for which fibonacci number to compute is the constant in the line "` movq $10, %rcx`". It compiles (with `gcc file.s`) and works fine under my cygwin install, but sadly is windows-only. A few lines were generated by compiling an .c file with only `int main(){}` since I actually have no idea what I'm doing. This sadly should be windows only
U!
Save
To be sure I have this: points[0:][0:] is equivalent to (points[0:])[0:] since an array in Python is always one dimensional so that multi[3][4] is shorthand for *get element [3], the fourth element of multi, which better be another array, because we then get element [4], the fifth element, of that element[3]*. This is unlike C/C++ where a multidimensional arrays are actually just that. 
&gt; On the scale that development happens and compared to a lot of sources out there, May is recent. What? Maybe mid July, August, but beginning May is half a year away already. Multiple large impact libraries have gotten deprecating updates, others have stopped being supported, others are completely gone. The article was a cheap ploy on the xkcd, that offered little to no relevant information about the thing it was offering a critique on, was seen for the cheap ploy it was back in may, and downvoted to hell. To be clear, I'm not shitting on you here-- I'm shitting on that bad article and just surprised by your definition of recency.
Yeah it does, keep on making awesome scripts dude!
I don't actually know that much about Cython, this was an experiment because I was curious about if I could use it easily to speed up some code processes.
Sounds like it's worth checking out.
As someone who learned a bit of C++ and Java first, python was weird for me. Where are my curly brackets and what is this identation error? Lol 
I'm not sure. Not that I've ever used anyway. Personally I would look for something where I could count on a 100% reliable match before looking into partial matches. Once you start allowing partial matches through (if the library can even do that which I'm not sure about), you open yourself up to all sorts of potential unforeseen fuckery. At one point my script needs to wait for the Microsoft Print to PDF progress window to go away before it does anything else, but that window has a loading animation that's always changing. So instead of looking for a screenshot of that entire window, I cropped the screenshot down to just the upper left corner ([https://i.imgur.com/bA7pZSi.png]https://i.imgur.com/bA7pZSi.png). As long as that little bit is on the screen, the script sleeps. Once that bit goes away, the script moves on. There's no lower size limit on the screenshots you search for. One of the screenshots searched for in my project is only 2x13 pixels.
Yeah. What helped me transition was deciding that I would not use excel for some period of time, only Python (Pandas). My role at the time required many ad-hoc queries and experimentation on subsets of data w/in massive tables in an impossibly large hadoop cluster, and queries would take minutes to complete, even with Presto. Over the course of forcing myself to learn Pandas by avoiding excel, I learned to love the speed of iteration I could achieve by pulling down base data sets locally with one query and then experimenting/iterating locally. For the first couple months my productivity probably decreased, but it paid dividends over time as my new workflows and abilities opened up opportunities for automation and provided access to more powerful tools. 
conda is the best. Having a separate conda env for every project makes things so much better.
So it would operate as a function, taking in arguments that you assign to and pass through the `def __call__():` function?! WHAAAAAAHG?! Oh man, that's really cool, though I'm having trouble imagining a use-case that wouldn't simply confuse things (though, I'm still a newbie, as you can probably tell). For those of you who are still following this and having trouble visualizing it, [I found an example here that was really helpful](https://www.daniweb.com/posts/jump/1064167) class Animal(object): def __init__(self, name, legs): self.name = name self.legs = legs self.stomach = [] def __call__(self,food): self.stomach.append(food) def poop(self): if len(self.stomach) &gt; 0: return self.stomach.pop(0) def __str__(self): return 'A animal named %s' % (self.name) &gt;&gt; cow = Animal('king', 4) #We make a cow &gt;&gt; dog = Animal('flopp', 4) #We can make many animals &gt;&gt; print 'We have 2 animales a cow name %s and dog named %s,both have %s legs' % (cow.name, dog.name, cow.legs) &gt;&gt; print cow #here __str__ metod work #We give food to cow &gt;&gt; cow('gras') &gt;&gt; print cow.stomach #We give food to dog &gt;&gt; dog('bone') &gt;&gt; dog('beef') &gt;&gt; print dog.stomach #What comes inn most come out &gt;&gt; print cow.poop() &gt;&gt; print cow.stomach #Empty stomach '''--&gt;output We have 2 animales a cow name king and dog named flopp,both have 4 legs A animal named king ['gras'] ['bone', 'beef'] gras [] '''
Ah ok. That works. 
So why pipx and not pipsi? And your readme should start with that.
Where is the AI in this?
I did not want to assume everyone is familiar with pipsi or scare away newcomers with even more tools names. There is a section at the bottom that discusses the differences.
Yes we could
This is basically the primary use case for Cython. You compile your computationally intensive functions and import them. Even for this benchmark, I imported the compiled code into a regular python file and then plopped the profiler down on top of that.
Load it in a string. Use string.split() to separate the records into a list. Use it again to separate the entries into lists. Filter the lists for zeros and see the length of the result.
Yes it is very cool. It is useful in situations where the functionality needs a callable but a basic function is less practical in implementation then a class/object. Maybe you need more configurability, a cache/state or base classes or whatever. Django suggests it for custom [middelware](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/http/middleware/#writing-your-own-middleware).
If I don't forget, I'll certainly let you know!
How many opcode are there in this recursive implementation? 20? 30? There's not much to jit there. 
As mentioned in the article they used "[endtest](https://endtest.io/)" to "magic button" AI into their testing.

Ah, sure. But it really depends on how you define obscure: everyone knows what SQL is, but significantly less people program in it on a regular basis (at least from my limited observations - my programming experience is limited to STEM applications, not IT). I guess it's more of a "serious" programming language than others, e.g. python, R, ruby.

`n in fib.cache.keys()` can be `n in fib.cache`. Doubt it would make much of a speed difference though.
&gt; Seriously, the sooner you start using virtual environments for everything, the better your life will be. Surprise: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13249880/why-are-python-builds-suddenly-not-framework-builds-when-using-virtualenv#13684638 
 Not the same algorithm, cos I was making up myself :). The decorator essential converts the def into a cpdef, but can use the var: type and -&gt; type annotations. Using cython numeric types to see what the limits were, as you don't get the free overflow behavour of a python int. `import cython` `@cython.ccall` `def fib(n: cython.int) -&gt; cython.longlong:` `a: cython.longlong` `b: cython.longlong` `i: cython.int` `a, b = 1, 1` `for i in range(n):` `a, b = a + b, a` `return a`
Good call! Didn't make any speed difference though.
you probably could use regular expressions (re module) and use the findall function. First you might want to cut the string into pieces. [https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.findall](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.findall) &amp;#x200B; In general regex is a great way to process strings. If you ever want to do something with regex and you dont know how debuggex can help you to develop the correct regex string. [https://www.debuggex.com/](https://www.debuggex.com/) This video also explains them very well: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgBWp9EIlMM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgBWp9EIlMM)
i dont know
You have an example of what you did to make a cpdef decorator? I don't have that much experience with Cython and I'm curious to see how you implemented it. Awesome that you did this benchmark recently too.
I thought this was going to be about building a website by starting with the data model :)
Are names and numbers on different newline separated lines? 
I got the decorators from here: https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/pure.html @cython.cclass creates a cdef class @cython.cfunc creates a cdef function @cython.ccall creates a cpdef function also: @cython.locals() declares local variables @cython.returns() to declare return type @cython.inline is the equivalent of the C inline modifier. @cython.final terminates the inheritance chain 
Sternum, like penis, is a medical grade term for a specific part of the human body. That's why I ask. 
Oh, so that how you do it. Well, thank you very much for info. Didn't touch Cython so far... but this may change a lot for me :) 
Here is one I can recommend A Byte of Python - Swaroop C H
interesting, thanks
It's provided in cython. I wouldn't have a clue how to make it myself, lol. Posted link to docs above.
`from turtle import *` `for x in range(18):` `circle(150)` `right(20)` I don't really know what else would be a minimum interesting for a class presentation
Use JSON to store the name, then an array of numbers e.g. [{ name:"Danny", numbers:[1,66,5,4,9] }, { name:"Bob", numbers:[9,7,2,5,3,7] }] Ant then use a JSON library to process the data
What kind of class are you doing your presentation in front of? If they aren't familiar with programming at all you could show them something like this and explain how it works line by line: &amp;#x200B; from turtle import \* for x in range(20): circle(120) right(18) &amp;#x200B;
/u/Azhain Would be cool if you edit the original post to include Numba results in your neat table. I'm sure lots of people bookmarked your post (I did), so when we'll look at it in 1 or 2 years for future reference, we'll find easily the whole comparison results. Thanks!
Did anyone try an iterative version using a loop? Those recursive function calls could still mean some significant overhead.
Very cool! The last time I did ASM was maybe 15 years ago so I wouldn't know how to benchmark it ;) But if someone has a benchmark, would be cool :)
Bad bot

There is still no complete support for Python 517 in pip even though it is being worked on: [https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/5743](https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/5743) &amp;#x200B; However, the weird thing is `pip` will use the `build-system` section to build the package but only if there is a `setup.py` file alongside the `pyproject.toml` file, even if the `setup.p``y` file is empty.
Well it's easy enough to try, I guess. I rewrote fibo() iteratively because otherwise fibo(100) takes too long, and tried it: &gt;&gt;&gt; fibo.fibo(100) Exception ignored in: 'fibo.fibo' OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long 0 I guess my assumption was wrong.
sorry ,i dont know anything ,i should not post this here, i mean ,i just wanna show you guys that matplotlib is cool, im a fucking idiot,i dont have any purpose
Here's how I did the tests.
Proper code seems more import, such as this slightly modified sidebar code: def fibonacci(num): a, b = 0, 1 for i in range(num): a, b = b, a + b return a Speeds: %timeit fibonacci(30) 1.84 µs ± 42.7 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each) %timeit fibonacci(300) 18.2 µs ± 610 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each) Comparison speeds: %timeit fibo(30) 365 ms ± 9.45 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each) %timeit jfibo(30) 7.3 ms ± 155 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each) %timeit jifibo(40) 796 ms ± 6.06 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each) %timeit jifibo(30) 6.66 ms ± 159 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
If it's missing something you want submit a pull request. Otherwise, there are 100 other python web frameworks you could check out.
You are slicing from 0 to the end of the array in both dimensions in the 2nd example. In the first example you are slicing the whole of the first dimension and only the first element in the second. 
I think I've now created issues for every (blocker and non-blocker) I found. I'm excited for this.
Thanks man, will get back in the horse !! I have a couple of projects in mind anyways :)

These functions will probably need to encrypt arbitrary data, you don't want to be constantly managing an instance of an object where you only want to use its functions. Wrapping things up in a class isn't really needed to keep things neat. The module itself does that by being a namespace. Perhaps invest time in creating higher-level functions that wrap up the functionality of these lower level ones. To make using your library as flexible with as few lines as possible. Proper docstrings and maybe even a sphinx doc if you plan to distribute. That said, I personally wouldn't roll a homebrew crypto module for production code. Easy to get wrong, very hard to get right, and the consequences of mistakes are usually dire. Of course, ignore this if you're a crypto buff :) Just my opinion though, good luck!
This series was popular, so I recorded another series called "PySimpleGUI The Complete Course". It's meant for people that are interested in writing more complex code than a simple window that grabs a bit of text or a filename. &amp;#x200B; There are 6 videos done so far. The playlist is located here: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl8dD0doyrvGyXjORNvirTIZxKopJr8s0](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl8dD0doyrvGyXjORNvirTIZxKopJr8s0)
Actually it's not all that hard, you can just compile the timing part of the C code that op wrote to asm with optimization turned off and copy-paste most of it (maybe change some registers up that are used in your own code :p)
I'm enjoying working through these: https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans/blob/master/README.rst They're inspired by set of Ruby koans, you might already be familiar with those? Also, not sure if they suit your level, or if they can serve as an overview of the Pythonic way of doing things. And I think this video is great: James Powell's "So you want to be a Python expert?" - https://youtu.be/cKPlPJyQrt4

Flask is just the part that handles requests and responses. Django is the whole thing with database models, templating, authentication, etc. They are very different and sometimes you don't need the massive feature set that Django has to offer.
Why everything has to be now a video?
Exactly right, we use Flask because we can rapidly develop pages in 50 lines of python that have a few GET and POST method request.
Hos would Javascript tie in as the frontend? Great work btw
yeah
You would put your JavaScript files in your static folder. When using Jinja, just reference the JS files in your HTML properly. Now just use JS as you normally would with a web page.
&gt; If you give us things like "pipx run &gt; https://github.com/cs01/pipx/archive/c08c6c2fce72d88b75a945ff0f31d3dd36b1cde2.zip#sha256:… &gt; " then I'll bite. And run-once (with all remnants removed). Running a zip could certainly be done. Do you want to create an issue? You may have seen it already works with commands like ``` pipx --spec git+https://github.com/ambv/black.git@f1ac6fe10 black --help ``` which may get you what you want.
In short, Django and Flask are two different web frameworks. Flask is a "microframework", meaning it's very simple and bare bones, while Django's philosophy is more "batteries included." For example, Django has built in database support, a built in ORM (meaning you don't have to write SQL queries to query the database), and a built in admin tool to do debugging. It is also much more structured. Flask on the other hand doesn't come with any of these things, but lets you build a website in just 7 lines of Python. I prefer Django for anything that's robust or that needs a database, but I love Flask for just giving an interface to some Python code I wrote, which is why I wrote the post about Flask. Maybe I'll do a comparison for Flask to Django post soon.
This is not correct - Flask and Django are two completely separate frameworks. See my reply to MetalAxeToby.
A podcast downloader script (Podcatcher): [https://github.com/kissgyorgy/simple-podcast-dl](https://github.com/kissgyorgy/simple-podcast-dl)
Bystander question: Why do you ask about those two specific options? You could also ask whether you should use a shovel rather than Bagger 239 when you need a hole in your garden. 
Maybe I was unclear, but I didn't say that they were related in any way or part of the same library.
Because i recently watched some django tutorials and then i saw this post and wanted to find out more about the pros and cos of both things from someone that is proeficient with at least 1 of them
Thank you very much for your detailed answer!
How many other web frameworks do you know?
Ony django and flask
Definitely I will. 
Python has no concept of “multidimensional”. This is just a list of lists. It could be a list containing lists of different length or even objects of mixed types. The numpy module does feature true multidimensional arrays with advanced multidimensional slicing. 
OK, then you have a lot of interesting reading ahead of you. I suggest you start with a three-way comparison of [Flask, Django and Pyramid](https://www.airpair.com/python/posts/django-flask-pyramid). That will probably give you one answer to your original question. 
Hey man, no need to be rude. Everyone is a beginner once, and beginners are often frustrated with trying to figure out what to start with first. 
Why do you consider that rude? 
 Unless it’s doing tail call optimisation. 
More open source libraries, even bad ones, are always a good thing. 
Higher user engagement rates
Software-as-a-service is a good fit for a lot of tasks. Testing is not one of them. Testing *should* be runnable on developer workstations. Why can't they ship a local script/binary/docker-image that calls their API is beyond me.
With more than 2.5 million weekly downloads for a [one-liner to swallow an exception](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nice-try), how can you even ask that question? 
I think that example only makes my question more relevant.

the great thing is, i used an email client, so you have the hardest part done. Each cell provider has an email extension you can use to email text messages to phone numbers. So for each of my friends phone numbers I sent an email to all of the email extensions for major phone providers. I scheduled the script to run using windows task scheduler. I believe the phone number was some weird (possibly random) number, but I think it included my email address in the message. numbers and lyrics were stored in seperate CSV files, just choose a random lyric, loop through the numbers and send the emails. If you want to impress the teacher, record the working provider extension so you only test all of them once for each number, build a scheduler into python, so Task Manager can run every min and you can set more complex conditions for when each message is delivered. Also build in a trigger flag. If the flag = 1, send the message and set the flag back to 0.
Even if empty? Dear lord wtf is going on with the PyPA. First they overly push pipenv, then they don't implement support for Pipfiles in pip, then they decide to support PEP 517/518 with an "only if" restriction which goes against the PEP and implicitly benefits for Pipfiles whenever it is implemented because that requires a setup.py either way.
Just for the record, I read it the other way and was appreciative of the clarification.

Continuing working on my personal bioinformatics library. I'm trying to get it to interface with other popular libraries (in python) and act as a wrapper for other common programs (not written in python).

Rule 1 of crypto is you dont roll your own crypto lib. Of course, someone has to make a crypto lib, so if youre doing it for education purposes, cipher away!
It's an UI test that's sort of runnable on developer workstation by definition. Like, I guess, you can just do what it does in your browser and see what happens? 
Great read. Have me considering using Flask to build a current site project.
Hope it goes well!
My personal favorite is the program was compiled long ago by a long-lost dev. Now, no one has a build environment for it and even if you manage to discover all the library dependencies and their proper versions, you now must figure out the magic defines to get it to compile *just right*. Oh, and hopefully you are using the correct compiler version. Ive run into "production" code that winds up with heap corruption issues if you use the "wrong" compiler version (well ofc the heap corruption always existed, but it gets exacerbated depending on the compiler). But I guess these are C problems, not python.
This is brilliant, well done! Also it's timed absolutely perfectly with me starting a coding club to teach people exactly this! I'm going to go from the basics of programming with python, to adding flask decorators to functions we'll have written to start them on the web dev path. With regards to learning databases, what are your thoughts? I feel that it would be best to learn "classic SQL" over a standard DB connection first, passing through the result object - which you can do easily with flask. Gives a more solid grounding for later going on to things like views, stored procedures, triggers, performance optimisation, database system differences/use-cases, etc. After that I was thinking of teaching an ORM as they are so popular, and nice in many cases. Looking around at the simplest to learn/understand/cleanest, I was thinking of going with peewee. Only complicated thing is their use of the Meta class, but that could follow a lesson on how classes are objects in python, which is useful to understand.. once you've mastered the traditional class/object relationship!
Nice article
Sounds sweet! No timeout code or to many options entered one Netflix?
Thats what I thought, too. But at the time, Netflix didnt have any of those. You could try as many times as you want without any penality.
I need to save this comment and read it later, kind of taking it apart little by little and get started to work, sounds really awesome and i hope to replicate it somehow closely. Thanks for the info! Also the assignment think was a bit of sarcasm :p
Class presentation without any more specific topic than "cool python snippet"? Oh god, maybe I AM grateful our school doesn't have teachers who know this language

There's only one-side of the argument here, and surprisingly given the title it doesn't even cover performance! The whole article is entirely pointless.
“Hey complete stranger on the internet who doesn’t know the exact things that I know, here’s a sarcastic question that makes it sound like the difference between two Python web frameworks is as obvious as the difference between a tool that has existed for thousands of years and a power tool still new enough to be a proper noun.”
What makes my question sarcastic? 
C build systems sound like a whole mess, but there's a similar (albeit smaller) analogous problem of different interpreters in Python land. PyPy has (had?) stackless mode and Jython has no GIL, for example, so recursion and thread-based concurrency will work slightly differently depending on your platform.
Yes
Nice. I have a website built using Flask. The only missing stuff now are; user logging and a blog. I know you can do user logging with Flask + a database, but I just never figured it out. Perhaps, this is what you should write about next. :P (hinting you).
Because when you've only heard the words "shovel" and "bagger 239" a few times, and they're both words that have been used to describe something you can use to dig, you might need some more clarification on which tool to use.
&gt;everything from Chapter 1-3 I understand, even the practice projects. But right when I get to the chapter 4 practce projects, I have no idea where to even begin. And of course it's easy to look up solutions to problems, but then I feel like I'm not really learning if I do that; and even then when I look at some of the solutions I'm like "how the hell was I supposed to come up with that?" I'm also reading this book. But I think back to how I learn anything it's practice and practice. Once you learn what can be done, and know how to find the solution then you eventually memorize that and learn the next skill.
Sorry, I wasn't overly clear. What I meant was, this product seems to require a publicly-accessible instance to test against. A lot of devs run a [webserver + database + test suite] directly on their workstation, test from there, then merge/rebase tested code into a "main" branch. From there, they (automatically) publish (lint/test/build/deploy/etc) to a publicly-accessible site (dev/qa/nightly/staging/etc). And it's not (just) about cost saving - deploying to a public instances is never quicker than running from a machine which already has the codebase. "Breaking the nightly" is not supposed to be part of the normal workflow. Some places even have policies or jokey punishments (eg, cowboy hats, silly trophies, donuts-for-the-team, etc) to enforce that. But, this product requires publishing untested code.
The PyPy JIT does not work that way. If you had one line and ran the program once, it would not JIT.
Can I build a blog with flask? I’m running https://homelab.city on Wordpress right now with a theme that costs $69/year (well that gives access to tons of themes). I’d love to get rid of the bloat and the cost but still have a nice webui for writing and managing posts and pages. I’ve dabbled some in static site generators and really enjoyed Hugo the most, but in the end, I didn’t like writing posts in Markdown :/
I have been looking into this as well. I can only think of doing it manually (building the page from scratch on Flask).
You're not giving us much... What error, exactly, are you getting? copy/paste from your terminal. for these type of questions in the future, you want r/learnpython
never mind, i figured it out, I needed to install setuptools first, thanks for replying though! :)
As someone who only ever does flask sites for my python projects that need web interfaces, where should I go to learn Django? 
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial01/ This is a good quick start https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/ This is a good long tutorial
You build website using Javascript/HTML and process data on the server using REST API / Flask
Why hard code the podcasts that it supports? You should let the user configure which podcasts to manage. Either use a configuration file or add the ability to add and remove them with the too itself.
[Apparently the author is fairly busy, not sure about some choices and is currently working on a new release](https://github.com/vibora-io/vibora/issues/204#issuecomment-423444081)
Thanks man 
I remember discovering that a big part of programming is making small things that work and orchestrating them into something bigger. Structuring more complex programs or god forbid an actual app was, and still is, my biggest growing pain.
Dude, that is very cool!
You can, but I find Django easier. Take a look at Wagtail.
Is this an IT job dipping into Neuropsych or the other way around? Or some sort of in between?
Javascript and python are pretty similar tbh. If you feel comfortable in python you should be able to pick up javascript pretty easily. That being said, the best way to learn a new language is to just start building something. Tutorials and whatnot (tutorials for learning a new language that is, not tutorials in general) are kind of a waste of time if your not a total beginner programmer. Maybe try implementing some stuff with Tensorflow.js?
Don’t sell yourself short. We are Python.
Flask has a very good community behind it, and there are a lot of [extensions](http://flask.pocoo.org/extensions/) available. For what you want to achieve, have a look at [Flask-Login](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask-Login) and [Flask-SQLAlchemy](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask-SQLAlchemy). I also highly recommend Miguel Grinberg's [blog](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/), [talks](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=miguel%20grinberg) and [course](https://courses.miguelgrinberg.com/) about Flask. He's the author of a "Flask Mega Tutorial" that covers everything you want to know on Flask and more :)
You might find the following resources useful: * [https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter13/](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter13/) * [https://github.com/mstamy2/PyPDF2/blob/master/Scripts/pdf-image-extractor.py](https://github.com/mstamy2/PyPDF2/blob/master/Scripts/pdf-image-extractor.py) They are not exactly what you want, but these are something to start with.

Worth noting that on the database side, there are popular ORM's available like SQLAlchemy which is arguably more robust and feature rich than Django's built-in ORM. Your preference for Django for more robust apps is fine, I just want to highlight that Django is not inherently more robust than an equivalent Flask app coupled with some best-of-breed Flask extensions or third party libraries.

Source code ?? 
And god forbid anyone tries to find out how come you only know those two. Enjoy your bubble of preconceived ideas! 
Code my guy ?
Appreciate the feeling, not sure if I 100% agree, but it would be nice if you also made a recommendation what to do, on top of what not to do.
So it comes soon :3 
I would post this in /r/learnpython rather than here, if your target audience is learnpython. 
Ive always wanted to make this. Looks sick
Yo wtf this is awesome. Share the code?
Amazing stuff! Care to share the code?
&gt;And god forbid anyone tries to find out how come you only know those two. Yeah it's not like they're the two most popular python web frameworks by an extremely wide margin or anything.
Nice, wheres the code?
Git👏hub👏link👏 please
I was wondering the same thing, Vibora looked really promising. I [opened an issue](https://github.com/vibora-io/vibora/issues/205) 29 days ago, still no comments.. and 31 opened PRs means the guy is really busy.
I don't have much experience with Django but I chose Flask because SQLAlchemy is such a powerful ORM. With Flask you can get most of the functionality of Django by adding and configuring a few extensions. Of course this takes a bit more work, you don't have it out of the box, but you have more flexibility and aren't locked into Django's way of doing things. Some great tools you can use with Flask: * SQLAlchemy (&amp; Flask-SQLAlchemy) - an ORM and more * Alembic - database migrations * Flask-Login - user management * Authlib - easily implement OAuth * Flask-Admin - customizable admin interface with almost no config required * WTForms (&amp; Flask-WTF) - declarative forms with validation * Flask-DebugToolbar
As I said, god forbid people learn about other options. May you have a continued life inside your artificial small world. I'll never see you again. 
Every Podcast have differences in their filenames/titles, even if they have the same RSS format. I wanted to make pretty, sortable filenames, so I have to parse every podcast differently. As the configuration: I wanted to make a really simple tool, so you give it the podcast name and that's it. You can write a shell script if you want to download more: for name in talkpython changelog; do podcast-dl $name; done There is no need for configuration.
I can tell you that running this excessive amount of function calls 1000 times did neither. Frankly, I had expected pypy to determine that the function is pure, and memoized it. 
Looks great!
No sign of AI there. 
Pretty cool work..waiting fr your github link
[https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read\_csv.html](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html) I suggest you try first here. You should specify `skiprows`.
I advise people wanting to get into ui/ux to start with tkinter for a few reasons : - it's built-in - it's got a good variety of widgets already, but not so many that you're lost as to which is better for a task and which isn't - There's no designer tool for it (well there's `pygubu` but it's badly designed imo, not as good as qt designer) so you're forced to write ground code (it's good for learning) When designing a ui, I give one advice : get a whiteboard and do the following : - list the inputs and outputs - list the format those inputs and outputs are in (is it multiline text, a table, and integer, a boolean, an array of boolean etc) - Choose one widget that is appropriate for the I/O you need to show to the user. Keep in mind that __ANY INPUT EDITABLE BY AN USER MUST BE VALIDATED__, and that some widgets do that for you (a button can only be clicked, a checkbox can only be true or false, a spinbox can only return floats etc) - Draw the layout of your UI on the board. If more convenient, group widgets together in frames to keep it organized. You want the user to know instinctively how to use your app. - Code it, read the docs and often. Stackoverflow is your friend, some people post helpful snippets there that you can just copy/paste and slightly modify for your application. - Most GUI code will inherit from a frame or some other base widget that you can then just pack onto the main window. Variables are now attributes of that frame, callbacks are now methods. Encapsulate everything, cause it's going to be a lot less painful to maintain down the road. Read about the MVC paradigm. Model-View-Controller works well for GUIs, and it's how I code GUIs I make with qt designer. The produced code is my view, I code the controller and the model. It's a third of the work done in minutes. Once you know how to write GUIs from scratch, you may use the tools at your disposal to make your life easier, but down the road, you'll be grateful you didn't dive into it and took shortcuts. You'll be less prone to mistakes, and won't take as long to design quality GUIs (and code to go along) PySimpleGUI comes from a good heart, I know it, but it's just not suitable for beginners, and veterans, well, there's not really a use for it as the code anyone writes with this library is quite frankly, one of the most horrendous piece of code anyone can write. I see a potential use for quick proof of concept and prototyping. But aside from that it has nothing for it. - it wraps around tkinter, so it has all its flaws (limited choice of widgets, ugly interface...) - the code is not maintainable for a normal human being - it saves very little time when you already know what you're doing and have snippets for that, or a designer tool - it's one more library to learn that no one will or should ever use in a production environment.
wow that's cool

there are dozens of these. google for "image to ascii" or "img2ascii" or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAlib or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libcaca
Why not a txt to jpeg converter?
Code pleeeease :D ! 
PyCharm Pro includes some scientific computing features you may find useful, though I don’t know if it has any special support for dat files. I believe NumPy can read them though. 
I'm not a big fan of codeacademy. I think their stuff is too simplistic.

Nice work, next up, a screenshot tool maybe :P
That is not the point. Like no fucking shit, pretty much any project you can think of probably has been made a hundred times. The point is figuring out how to do it yourself.
Great answers here . I would like to contribute what I learnt about Flask and how I successfully deployed FLask API and used the same. (Now the i dont serve dont apis cause I dont have paid servers) [https://letssolveeverything.blogspot.com/2018/01/how-to-run-python-program-on-internet.html](https://letssolveeverything.blogspot.com/2018/01/how-to-run-python-program-on-internet.html) &amp;#x200B;

To be honest, there are lots of things you should to know. For example, the lessons students learning in college are usually useful . However, I recommend you to build a real project before you leaning those lessons, you can following many wonderful documents to start a project, for example Django's, which is a popular web framework using Python. During your work, you will find out so much knowledge important, also will find how to learn programing next step. Good Luck!
no
I've been reading a lot of good things about Wagtail CMS (django-based). It's on my to-do list. https://wagtail.io https://madewithwagtail.org 
It's just data. 
That's just silly. You misunderstood how it works. The tests are not in a blackbox, you can see all the steps and what locators are used. Each time you run a test, the platform learns more about your elements, in the sense that it remembers a lot of characteristics about your elements and it ranks them. The next time you run your test, if it doesn't find an element with the locator that you provided, it will look for the element by using the other characteristics that it remembered. It carefully checks if it's actually that element, It will not make your test pass every time.
Hi there, it seems you didn't read the Documentation section. If you application (web or mobile) is not publicly accessible, that's perfectly fine. You have a lot of different options, you can either whitelist their list of Secure Gateway IP addresses or you can export the test and run it on your own machine. 
Hi there, it's actually there. The engine from Endtest is using Machine Learning to learn more about your elements as you run your tests. It will remember different characteristics about an element and it will rank them. The next time you run a test, if an element has changed, the engine will look for the element by using the other characteristics that it remembered and it will update your test. It cannot mistake a bug for an outdated test.

Did you mean to post a link to the code, rather than an image? 
&gt;\[Help\] Pandas to ignore first line and use 2nd as index thank you!
thanks for your reply, i tried skiprows before and it actually skip them entirely and not adding back those skipped rows in the final file. cheers
Perfect
Probably not the best idea, but since no one else got a good one so far try to convert you file to base64, store that as a string in the python file and convert it back into binary at runtime. Google should tell you how that will work
I'm pretty sure py2exe has an option where it just packs everything into the executable. I haven't used it in a long time though, so I could be wrong.
So if you do like video to ascii convert than, you know when someone speaks the text change in same time, this is good but that would be cool to.
Whether meta information is or isn't allowed in another subreddit isn't a good indicator of whether information towards users of that subreddit should be addressed here. 
&lt;I_see_what_you_did_there.gif&gt;
My cat needs this code plz thnx
You can't tell me what to do! I mean, especially since I'm not a mod.
&gt; There's no designer tool for it .... so you're forced to write ground code I don't agree with this: * If you're new to programming, actually drawing out buttons, text boxes, etc. is a really nice way to bridge the divide between what they already know (how to use software as a user) and what they don't (how to create software). * It's a tremendously practical way of getting people to learn through experimentation - particularly useful for learning about things like containers, layouts, components, and relative positioning. * Often all the properties of a given component are available, with the correct "pickers" for the various types - so it's also a really handy help reference but also something you can't really go too wrong with. * You can dig into the produced code and see how it all works - so it can be a quicker/more convenient way to learn how to achieve something. I have no experience with PySimpleGUI, so I can't comment on how well they achieve that, but certainly I've found similar tools for Java, .Net, C++, etc. to be tremendously helpful.
the most people using python for web development and analysis data. i never found (in my country) using python for android. hardware compatible?? definitely python :)
I agree, that's surely common sense, why do you bring it up? I made no reference to whether the post should be addressed here - only that it would likely not be a good fit for the sub you recommended.
Yu wôt
Let me ask what made you want to comment in the first place? This is meta information for a subreddit, and the subreddit rules nonwithstanding, meta information is generally accepted, unless there is a designated meta channel, which there isn't in this case. 
maybe in the future ai would be same as human who can recruit the worker. idk, thats just maybe
You recommended that OP specifically post this in /r/learnpython, rather than here - that's a poor recommendation and needed to be addressed. Clearly you're not a regular user of /r/learnpython otherwise you'd know that it has a very specific Q&amp;A format. There have been many, many posts and comments around the various Python subs referring to the fact that their post to that sub was deleted because it didn't meet the requirement of their specific Q&amp;A format. For example, [the latest one I saw](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9pbagn/creating_a_python_website_from_the_bottom_up/e80d9vr/) posted just yesterday. Sometimes you just have to accept that some advice you've given in good faith was just ill-informed, learn from it, and move on. Never stop trying to help people though!
What’s not working? The messages aren’t printing? The loop isn’t breaking? You don’t know how to make a loop?
I am in fact a regular of /r/learnpython. I am also a regular of /r/Python, and whatever the rules are elsewhere, they do not make a posting such as this topical here. As for your repeated claim of nontopicality, I think your example is lacking wrt. to what is a meta question in learnpython. 
This is /r/learnpython meterial. Please read the guidelines for code formatting before asking your question there.

It's the same idea as over 99% of all people on Earth wouldn't be able to solve even the simplest integral, or, how popular McDonalds is compared to any decent food. Python is known for its huge army of low-skilled programmers, so, there's nothing unexpected in your results.
I’ll post the code when I’m back from school
Ha! I felt sure that would have been the end of our conversation. &gt; I am in fact a regular of /r/learnpython. Ahh, then why did you recommend posting an opinion piece to a Q&amp;A sub? A post that would almost certainly be deleted. &gt; whatever the rules are elsewhere, they do not make a posting such as this topical here. Again, I've made no comment as to whether the post is suitable for here. &gt; I think your example is lacking wrt. to what is a meta question in learnpython OP has asked no question, merely stated an opinion - one that seems quite unpopular as it turns out. Why would you recommend they state that opinion as some kind of meta post on /r/learnpython? Ultimately, in the grand scheme of things, and even the very small scheme of things, this is an irrelevant point and we should all just move on with our lives. I have enjoyed talking with you though, seeing how you try to twist, turn, and ignore things to defend a throw-away comment. But I think, therefore, we must leave it there and my questions above are purely rhetorical. Have a good day!
&gt; Ahh, then why did you recommend posting an opinion piece to a Q&amp;A sub? A post that would almost certainly be deleted. Because - contrary to your belief - there is no strict rule against non Q&amp;A posts in learnpython. I invite you to point out where in the subreddit FAQ or the sidebar you have found cause for that belief. 
It was my first project ever just felt like posting it
I see , well in same time im kinda confused , and in other hand i understand some basics about programing. How to explain that " i cant see big picture in my head how to do for example big project ,like software application". But yes i gathered some books, guides,tutorials and stuff. But would be nice if i know proper way what to learn first, and second and etc... Yes i saw Django and Flask , but as i said dunno should i jump into them, or learn roots of programing :D.
I agree with you , practice is just must have while learning something. I can read that book i took today , but i have no idea how to use that in practical part. PyCharm is what ppls suggested for beginers , i saw also that he has some tips to point where i did mistake. Thanks for web page , and i will check PyScripter and IDLE. Thanks alot :)
Too bad it wasn't a JPEG.
it's okay that you posted it it's cool that you make it yourself but just strange that this kind of projects always dominate this sub, couple month ago there was exact same project https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/99c949/python_script_to_generate_ascii_art_from_an_image/ and it too was on top every month someone post image-to-text and every time same reaction "whoa dude very cool, give us your code"
\&gt; I still don't understand how hello-world-level projects like this become top posts on python sub... I thought it was cool. So did 400 other people. So feel free to leave if you consider yourself too advanced for this sub.
can write code to convert jpg to txt. cant take screenshot properly. 
He’s more concerned about the recycling aspect. Yes. It’s cool. But it was also cool the previous few times too. It’s not being advanced. It’s having seen the code before lol
Transactions are your friends
[transactions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/tutorial-transactions.html) are your friends
PostgreSQL itself will handle this - they're designed to be accessed by many different processes over many different computers. In addition to that, as /u/ful_vio says, if you find you need to execute multiple SQL statements together such that if one fails you want them all rolled back, then transactions are the way to manage that.
It's because Python's ecosystem is now filled with the "me-too" crowd. People who are trying to figure out how to code, for the sake of it or because they are worried about their futures. Rather than people trying to figure out how to solve actual problems with technology. If you have been around more than 5 years, you can likely feel the shift. We are seeing recycled posts, because the community is recycled people. They come for a bit, learn a bit, then another distraction likely pops up. It's some form of Eternal September.
It’s one of the first things people make that makes them think, *Whoa, Python is really cool.* That probably explains the frequency of the posts. I’m with you in the cool-but-not-impressive camp. Hell, when I was OP’s age ***all*** computer art was ASCII art, and I had a 2 x 3 foot poster of Spock on my wall... but I digress. Also, get off my lawn!
That's Lt. Commander data to you! Unless by giving him a human title you're trying to highlight how Data's quest to become a person itself makes him human then carry on. And I'm not crying about how beautifully Data's journey shows us what it means to live.
Keep doing you my man. Some of the most talented people I know started with projects like this. Only breeds interest and creativity. There tends to be a lot of gatekeeping whenever you begin in areas that people have put a lot of work into. You’re doing the right stuff, keep it up. 
At least have the decency to pay someone to do your homework for you.
Hey. I just happened upon this post, I'm trying to implement this tutorial but in opencv4nodejs ... I am getting the wrong output from the models though. Just an object with static values.. at a loss about what to try next to be honest. Totally new to OpenCV and opencv4nodejs (although it seems most of it translates well)..

1. You can use the equivalent async/await in JS rather than Promise syntax 2. Promises and async await are not equivalent in Python because the implementation is fundamentally different. In Python coroutine functions create coroutine objects which can either be awaited or submitted to the event loop for a Task that is a wrapper around the coroutine object, but the task does not have equivalent API and it isn't safe to affect the coroutine object after it has been wrapped in a task. Also the Task is more like the equivalent of a Future / Deferred rather than a Promise. In JS coroutine functions create a very thin wrapper around Promises, which are implicitly submitted to the event loop at call time. There's also the issue of the event loop exisiting on the same thread and thus blocking any sync code from executing while JS doesn't have this problem. While yes JS and Python can do the same things in terms of async/await, this is only when the items are extremely basic. Any complex scheduling unfortunately can not be done in Python, which is why I'm in the process of writing a simple wrapper for asyncio that provides coroutine functions that create coroutine objects that are thin wrappers over some other awaitable object that acts like JS Promises/C# TaskCompletionSources, and also submits to a default event loop on a different thread.
Transactions are not only atomic, which is what you describe. Concurrency control is done via transaction's isolation level. Tow concurrent processes updating the same record are going to mess up in some way and that depends on the isolation level. Even single statements are run in a transaction with default settings which, for postgres, is the read committed level. You have a few options via different isolation levels. Have a look [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/transaction-iso.html) for what's available and decide for what's best on a case by case basis.

Wouldn't a tie show that two teams are more even e.i. if the top team ties the bottom team, then maybe the top team is not as good as thought, and likewise for the worst
/r/learnpython and/or pyinstaller's mailing list
Sorry, but I cannot upvote this - you took a picture of a screen.
A top team's result against a bottom team wouldn't necessarily be an indicator of whether the top team is top and bottom team is bottom. This whole concept of ties could be construed as flawed. Say, team 1 played vs team 2 around 50 times. Say 40 were tied, 8 were team 1 wins and 2 were team 2 wins. The draws are effectively kind of cancelled out. They aren't a clear indicator to tell teams apart. Get me? 
Easier for me lol
If possible, I would process the columns to match each other. So, make them both lowercase, truncate them to some shorter common value, etc. Then you can just use pandas.merge() 
The loop isnt looping
Yes exactly! However if that element needs to be self healed, and a different element with different behavior is considered "equivalent", then the test will still pass-- but the test won't be correct. I don't care if you have logs. If you are lazy enough to rely on this service rather than update your tests, you will be lazy enough to not monitor those logs either. Arguably monitoring those logs will be more work than just updating your tests because it means you have to remember a wide variety of interacting components, and have to check each and every log-- which we both know that in larger applications no one will do because it is unreasonable effort. Do you not know what a black box is? The user of this service has no capability of knowing how the AI makes its decisions internally, logged what those actions are or not. https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=black%20box

Automate the boring stuff with python is a great book for beginners. I’d stick with Pycharm if I were you and use IDLE for the quick and dirty stuff. 
Which is why I said please :)
RemindMe!
You need to go to nice person school, bro.
Doing what? Web sites or data science for example?
Well shit, I don't know. I'm trying to self teach with the end goal of breaking into the field somehow. Thoughts?
My advice is think of some "problem" you have. For me, one of my first projects was scratching my own itch: I used to browse [NCIX.com](https://NCIX.com) for the best deals, so I wrote a crude web scraper that found all the deals on NCIX, then spat out a .html file with the deals sorted in reverse order of % discount. Or, if there's a card game you like to play, try implementing that in Python. Stick to something that you already know (i.e. the rules for aforementioned card game) so you're not struggling with _both_ Python syntax/design _and_ the actual problem at the same time. 
Thanks!
I agree with you. There's a ton of subreddits about learning Python and programming languages in general. I don't want to see so much "First [p]rogram go easy 😉😜" on r/python.
I think it's because Python is a very easy language to pick up and so the barrier to entry is lower. That's a good thing because people get to learn to code and what not but it does seem to lead to a ton of beginner projects on the sub. I do think we're seeing more than usual though. Three years ago this sub was mostly articles about Python. It felt a lot more "technical". A year and a half ago it was all about machine learning. Now it seems we've pivoted to noobie projects.
Ill check it for sure, thanks for tips .
/r/learnpython. Also, format your code correctly for Reddit so we can see the indentation.
Two things. 1) Show us formatted code (use four spaces, see the sidebar) 2) What results do you get when your run your code?
It looks like you're on windows. Why not use the snipping tool for things like this? It's my go-to for any time I need to grab screen contents easily.
Whenever someone starts coding, they usually face this issue. What next? I've learnt it, what do I do next? I usually give them two points: 1. Create Tic-Tac-Toe for two players. See how you can figure out if one player has won in different ways. One example is to hard code every single possibility, but what next? There's gotta be a better way right? Think of better ways to solve this. This usually puts all that you've learnt to test. You could solve this in a number of ways but you'll still need loops and conditions. This is a great test for that. 2. Once you've created _Le_ Tic-Tac-Toe, like the other comment posted here, work on a project that you would be interested in. In case you like Reddit and have a basic bot in mind, you can make it using Reddit's API which is written in Python (It's called [PRAW6](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). If you love Discord (which I do), you could make a bot for discord using their API (It's called [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)), also written in Python. One of my friends starting out made a LED Strip where the colors were controllable (This involved a Raspberry Pi and a LED Strip Driver, but the code was written in Python). Basically, point number 2 says: Choose something you'd like to do, and try solving it with Python. Python has tons of libraries that help you work with Images, Audio, Machine Learning, AI and everything else possible. I hope that you find something you'd like to do and hope that you never stop learning! Also, if you want a good tutorial for the bots for Reddit and Discord, just let me know and I'll link you two tutorials that helped me. Reading through the two links that I sent you could appear to be quite scary and you may not understand it. They're just for reference in case you want to go through some sample code. Cheers!

They are not so hard to make asynchronous.

You can rename columns using a dictionary. Just rename the columns that you need to merge on and order does not matter. This Stack overflow discussion has some context - [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11346283/renaming-columns-in-pandas](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11346283/renaming-columns-in-pandas)
First, you can make the df (df1) with uppercase columns into lowercase using this code: df1.columns = df1.columns.str.lower() Next, you can compile a list of column names from df2 that are subsets of of column names from df1, and create a dictionary (to be used to rename columns in df1): rename_dict = {col1:col2 for col1 in df1 for col2 in df2 if col2 in col1} Then use that dictionary to rename your columns in df1: df1 = df1.rename(index=str, columns=rename_dict) 
Where are you gonna put that course? I am really interested in it.
Theres us a library by the name of PIL, one could just use that to turn a picture unto an array of hex codes, after that one could just write different characters into the text file depending on the hex code if the current pixel, shouldn't take more than 15 to make.
Then answer to those people instead of starting a new vague top level thread.
Fuck off?

Still working on that pokemon companion app for roleplaying. Imagine a pokedex like utility that gives you possible pokemon encounters for your current route, so you can build your team and decide whether its worth it to farm a route for a rare or not. The hardest part so far is making it version friendly, so it can get through data that it might be expecting or not, and just parsing the huge Response files properly.

I teach at a High School, and the course is offered there through the Cisco Academy program. Your local High School, Tech Center, or Community College may have it. The course is called Programming Essentials In Python.
Joke's on you, someone has been waiting for a scratch file of mine since 2013.
Someone on youtube has been waiting for a scratch file of mine since 2013 :)
Seriously, I call bullshit. Nobody is writing a program and then taking a picture with their phone over a screenshot 
You should ask that on \r\learnpython

And before someone asks, no I haven't implemented a formal Kalman filter into the program yet. That's basic control theory 101, I know, consider it room for future improvement. Actually it's kind of impressive the program is doing as good as it is programmed by a noob like myself without a filter on the noise.
I wish I could help you with the nodejs part. Try to read the code and understand what is being done. Its pretty simple. If you're totally new to opencv, I would recommend you check out the documentation and read about the basic methods used.
Thanks
I get it! You converted Data in one format to Data in another format.

Of course I disagree, having written those documents. The proof lies in the results that are produced. I'm seeing some great GUIs being made by people that had previously given up trying to make GUIs using other frameworks. I'm surprised at the level of vitriol being voiced. It's a piece of software written to help people create GUIs in Python. It's that simple. There was no malice behind creating it. Something seems to have touched a nerve that doesn't seem very logical. Of course you can take shortcuts in writing software. Few people write in assembler and that used to be the only choice for a lot of projects. And people are writing some fine looking GUIs using PySimpleGUI. It would seem very inefficient for someone to write their own linear algebra subroutines when a package provide those has been written and is in wide use. You can dislike the package, that's your prerogative. But openly warning people not to use it, that seems extreme and not very helpful to those wanting to create some fun, easy to use GUIs. 
Where can I participate?
Has anyone noticed in the documents, and in the first video lesson, that there is a specific section on drawing out your GUIs on a piece of paper? I know it's not a whiteboard, but the same idea is being taught. [https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/#the-window-designer](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/#the-window-designer) It's not all about quickly prototyping. There is a serious attempt at teaching GUI design as part of the process of learning the package. There is at least one teacher that has already written a class teaching GUI programming using PySimpleGUI. And there's another technical college that is using it in Asia as well. The educational community is embracing it as a way to teach, partly because the success rate is good. The focus is on using the widgets in a way that results in a nice user interface rather than the nuts and bolts of interfacing with a GUI framework.

I was just thinking about how to do this. It's possible. And you could use this script to generate the training data.
Also: https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/series/beginners-guide/1.11/
Do you work in retail? 
You must have really long school days :(
I'm warning beginners not to use it. Just the fact that your doc is one of the worst I've seen, and that the flow of information is not clear. Not to mention that basically everything happens in the global namespace. 
Followed by a text conversion of the screenshot and a diff check
You can use a dict: level_desc = { '10': 'Python, Ruby, Perl', '8': 'C#, JavaScript, Go', '5': 'Java', '2': 'C' '0': 'Assembly' } chosen = input('What is the level?') print(level_desc[chosen])
And now you know what the 80's were like.
This is quite a general question, and it's difficult for someone to answer without giving you the whole program, for which more detail should be necessary. Here's what I suggest. Start to write your program, even if it does 1/10 of what you need. Then post what you've got so far, so that you can get specific help. ("Learn Python the hard way" is often recommended) Hints: I think you probably want to create a dictionary containing your levels and the things that correspond to that level. If you don't know how to use dictionaries, you should sit down with a good beginners Python book that does these things in detail.
Loved micropython on my Wemos D1 Mini, such a breeze to get coding quickly!
It's actually something based around a once-a-week meeting offline, essentially a coding club, geographically local to me here in the South East of England. I've got some meetings next week with places to hold it, so I'm looking to start in around a month or so. The geographical area in which I work is in dire need of ways out of the "no experience, no jobs to get experience, no money to move" vicious circle, with desperately few options for people out of education and work. So the thing I know best, software development, is the best thing I can do to help.. that's the reason for the group to exist. There will of course be a strong online component too, and I'll also be encouraging the use of other sources of help online - in many ways the key to the whole thing is to teach how to learn for themselves, always showing the next step, clearly explaining any difficult concepts, etc. Here are some next steps for you... * Add me on Discord: Vampatori#6092 * I'll invite you to the discord server when I set it up. * Ask me any question at any time, I firmly believe that there are no stupid questions. Even if your first question is "What is Python and how do I even begin to use it?". * Join the [Python Discord Server](https://discord.gg/8NWhsvT) - they're a really friendly and helpful group of people. * Subscribe to /r/learnpython and /r/learnprogramming and get involved. * It doesn't matter if you don't have or can't afford to run a "proper" computer - PythonAnywhere.com allows you to code from a wide range of internet-connected devices.
This project now has a github. [https://github.com/heysoose/Shades](https://github.com/heysoose/Shades)
Finally getting around to learning django. It's been on the to-do list for years but I never had a project that needed it, but finally have one at work! 
This whole post was a setup for that joke.
School homework on python which is really easy 😂
Cool! I made something similar last year. [https://github.com/vkotek/img2char](https://github.com/vkotek/img2char)
pycairo‑1.17.1‑cp37‑cp37m‑win32.whl from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pycairo works for me. Just open a console then cd to where you've downloaded your file like some-package.whl and use pip install some-package.whl
I got to install the py2 version; the py3 still gives me errors. I ran the script, and it created many .png files. How you make an animation out of those files like OP posted?
Absolutely
Depends on the task. Choose the task, then choose tools. If you’re making an iPhone application, don’t use python. If you’re coding a web server, then pythons an okay choice. If you’re creating a a desktop application used for editing documents, you can use Python but it’s probably not the best choices. Don’t use it when it doesn’t fit the problem. That’s the only way to choose.
Ethereum is as close as you are going to get.
That would be Ethereum. See r/ethereum.
We’re in /r/python just go to a different sub if you want to see pandas. Or google. Or whatever.
Sounds like /r/gatekeeping to me. Perhaps you should look for an other subreddit instead of complaining about the posts in this one.
Perhaps you're trying to take too large of a step at a time. It's normal to feel frustrated with tech - hell, I've been a programmer for years and I get frustrated on a weekly basis -, and it's up to you what you do to cope with these frustrated moments. Myself, I go do something else for an hour or two and a new idea pops up naturally. If it doesn't, I get back to studying/working with a fresh head, which also helps. As for practical advice, try easier programs. Study some math alongside, solve those problems from online free hacking schools, check out Euler project solutions. Programming is a mix of language, logic and maths - all of which are learnt via repetition and practical application.

Never tried it but I think [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) could help you. 
Doesn’t have to be jog btw just thought of the file format
[here is the code](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9pmw4k/the_code_for_the_image_to_text_program/?st=JNGE027H&amp;sh=d2cae748) 
Neat! You know you can take a screenshot right? Lol! Jk
This is a question that is better auited for /r/learnpython 
I have no idea what you want to do from your explanation. But if you simply want to turn a list of string-encoded numbers into ints, try ```l_ = [int(x, 10) for x in l]```
[here is the code](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9pmw4k/the_code_for_the_image_to_text_program/?st=JNGE027H&amp;sh=d2cae748) 
Looks pretty interesting
I wanted to also remove all the chars. For example the brackets and single quotes. If I didn't remove them. Then how can I casting the string to int?
Looks neat. Was smaller than I expected, having never done anything like this. I would add some verification lines to the code. Obviously this is intended for you or friends to use, but it would be a good practice to validate the input fields. Stuff like checking if the input path is valid and leads to an actual jpeg, otherwise throw an error explaining why, rather than letting python do it for you. Or verify that the user specified an integer for the scale factor input you are using, otherwise inform the user that any except an integer is not allowed. You could use a while loop to continue prompting the user for a valid input rather than having them re-run the program every single time they enter an invalid input. 
Nice to have it here, but would be even better if you uploaded it in text form :p (not on Reddit, rather on pastebin/GitHub/...)
Nope. AFAIK Fortran, C, C++, Pascal only 
This is such an amazing feat, thoroughly impressed. I look forward to seeing your code
I would not focus too much on being socially useful. As a professional programmer, most of the actual work that I do does not rise to that standard. I spend way more time working on small tools, or small aspects of large systems which are useful to a small community of users. With that in mind, find a relatively simple task to automate, such as the preparation of a 'business report' from a database. Such a program would require the student to demonstrate an ability to work with python modules and databases, in addition to understanding basic sorting algorithms and data structures. Lastly, it would have the advantage of being similar to the kind of work they are likely to encounter in the real world.
I think the point is that it's small enough to fit in a one screen picture and admittedly that's pretty cool.
comma,AI has a cool open source project for self driving cars.
Take a screenshot of the window and pass it to your program, then post the output. 
It's an image to text program. Clearly we're supposed to run it on this image to get the source code.
Well, you could've done both
If you used `numpy.digitize` and some clever indexing, you could rewrite this code in a succinct, loopless and efficient way
Even trio doesn't support the complex scheduling I have in mind. I unfortunately don't have simple examples other than anecdotal ones that I've mentioned on both here and /r/programming, but I can link to some if you like.
Quick, in order to get the source code, we need the source code!!!!
There's a difference between gatekeeping and wanting stronger moderation. I think that a lot of these beginner programs are cool. I actually really liked this one because I'd always wondered how images like this were made. I read a bit if the library documentation and I might use it someday, we'll see. That said, I think this content has other subreddits that fit it better. I think r/Python was better when it was more intermediate and advanced topics and recently it's become a lot more skewed towards beginner projects. There are no other subs for that type of content but countless subs exist for purely beginner level content.

Well the functionality is available commercially, though my specific telescope isn't compatible (only newer Autostar LX200's can use it). The program is called OpticTracker and it's quite expensive for the fully featured version with automatic finderscope tracking: http://www.optictracker.com/Products.html

No need to specify the starting bound of range as 0, you can use range(h) and range(w) directly
That really looks cool!
Just because you have a doc doesn't mean it's agood doc. If you want to see the best docs I've ever seen, look at unity's docs. But I won't go into details, I know you love your library and from what I see you can't take criticism. Just makes me laugh that you take the Zen of Python and PEP8 as an example, and call the library pythonic when you don't even apply those rules to your own code.
and stop making a new post for each response.
So you admit that this is a problem and that we're slowly drifting towards karma whoring but you still think it's gatekeeping to be opposed to that? &amp;#x200B;

Think about these lines: for i in range(0,h): if i % pixelToCharacterScale == 0: for j in range (0,w): if j % pixelToCharacterScale == 0: now go and have a look at the function paramaters for range: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range

I would be interested to know if you have had any experience with Sanic? I want to start experimenting with it but a post I saw on this subreddit showed some obvious security flaws with it. I am currently split between flask and cherrypy. Flask has much more documentation and tutorials but cherrypy seems to do the exact same thing and also seems to do it a bit better (has automatic routing and seems to be a bit faster). By the way, I really like your article. Good job!
Once it is cleaned up i can post it up if you're interested
Plz explain
That looks awesome! Great job. Source? Always wanted to code up some multi body systems
Ever compressed by finding the data in the digits of py and storing the offset?
Lmao no, it's got a Xeon, SSD OS disk and 32GB of RAM...

Haha maybe when I’ve learned more
Hey! I've never heard of cherrypy or sanic, but I'll have to try them out! In general I like to stick with Django or Flask since they're the main frameworks, but I may have to expand that list :)
The best way I've found to do this sort of thing is to store your audio as long [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) arrays, and do the calculations that way. It's a bit trick, but insanely fast...

I think theres something to be said about the relative ease of use of python when the programmer can't take a screenshot.
No. Sorry my observations might have offended. I'll reflect more on how, why and what I share in the future.
Ive a e1225 v5, 48 gigs of ram on a brand new nvme drive and pycharm sucks rocks. Cant disagree with OP
I've rethought about my original post. And, edited it to avoid offense. I'm really sorry being overly, and unecessarily critical. I will say, I dont feel like I deserve being sworn at. All the best to you.
I don't like my job so I decided to automate parts of it. Turns out I'm kinda good at automating things and can complete almost half of my regular tasks in 2-3 seconds when before it'd take 40 minutes to an hour. Some examples: Current place relies too much on excel report upon excel report and updating them all and combining and qcing etc is a big waste of time. I used pandas and glob to fetch excel files and build reports. One report took almost 2 hours the old way. Now it takes 1.5 seconds to generate and 3 minutes for general qc. We have to send out complicated invite packages to scientific types. Contact info sheets, welcome letters, conflict of interest docs, and more. They normally get assembled and sent in batches of 3 - 4. One package took 30 minutes to make. My program now assembles all attachments, customizes them per intended recipient, writes the required email, attaches everything, and presents it for double checking in 5 seconds. It could be faster were it not for Outlook and Python interactions taking forever. Boss asked me to download, manually, 1001 god damn documents of a soon-to-be-retired document management portal. Apparently IT said it was impossible for them to just run a script and download them all. Im not a fucking intern but hey I got bills to pay. So I tried automating the task with GETs/POSTs. Didnt work cause whoever made these fucking websites did some really weird and questionable stuff. So I used selenium instead and it worked like a charm. Downloaded 1001 files in less than 10 minutes. Had folder structures setup for groups of documents based on when they were used and how made and moved all the downloads to their appropriate folders in another 10. I fucking love Python man. 
It's a joke... &amp;#x200B; He wrote an image to text converter... he posted his code as an image...

I'd see what you think of DataCamp. It's marketing is aimed at Data Science but has a fair few courses focused on financial stuff. 
Close, but this produces a text file with a single symbol on each line. Line 32 of your code needs to be moved one indent to the left! Thank you though, saved me some typing
Are you looking for a book? Computational Physics by Newman has a lot of good stuff in it, it's not limited to physics. Apress might have also published something, worth a check.
I'd love to see the source for this as well! I've wanted to make something like this for a while.
To add to this: **SHIFT + Print Screen** on most Linux distros gives you a resizable snipping tool style screenshot. Also **WIN + SHIFT + S** is a new one for Windows that does snipping tool without having to launch the program, snip is copied to your clipboard.
Yes. Thank you i will.
Brush up on the basics, you should have the core parts of the language memorized. Often times when I program i have the same feeling as running long distances - Am I going to make it this time? It's frustrating since I never thought coding would turn out to be a constant exercise in dealing with uncertainty. On the other hand it's starting to become fun and I'm getting accustomed to being confused constantly, I just know how to deal with it quicker now. 
There's actually a practice around not slamming your code with unnecessary comments. Not necessarily expressed properly here but the idea is that "comments are code" and that your code "reads like English". If you can't understand the code without adding comments it's not readable enough.

The privacy policy is like opening a door to your computer? What? If you're really this paranoid better off unplugging your ethernet/wifi and only use ed
Yep. I teach this to anyone I train if the topic comes up. The code should be named well enough that you can read it at a glance and mostly be able to understand what a given block is doing. Comments are for explaining **why** that code is doing what it's doing, specifically in cases where it looks like it's doing something weird. Or if there's a particularly complex piece of logic that just has to be the way it is, leave a comment explaining the what at a higher level, and maybe a note as to why you didn't do &lt;insert obvious solution everyone would think of but you tried and it didn't work here&gt;. 
 What concerns would you have?
How does programming on microcontrollers with micropython compare to arduino SDK or regular python on computers?
The math and logic in the show is dependent on compression that doesn't exist. No decentralized mass data communication tool will succeed with current technology, simply because of there are fundamental limitations-- Whenever someone asks me about a decentralized anything the simplest answer is go to a mathematician to learn some graph theory, then a physicist to combine that knowledge with information about the speed of light, then any cpu limiter to find out that the ratios of the speed at which you would need to transfer data would never work. It is a great concept in theory, but impossible with current technology. The only reason it works in the show is because of their nonsense impossible compression algorithm. Multiple undergrad and graduate students have tried and failed-- and that was with them severely limiting their data transfer to simple messaging.
Having used PIL extensively in several projects, I can't even imagine dealing with all those image formats as cleanly as they do. That library is some kind of amazing black magic. 
I've been pushing my company for 3 years to do this. I succeeded today. I long ago figured out that new features don't matter. All that matters is what I can't do that I need today. I can't use the new version of matplotlib/pandas/ipython/jupyter. Numpy is killing support at the end of this year despite just pasing 50% downloads on 3.x. (I conveniently failed to mention that). What finally won was Python 2.7 was built against an ancient version of Visual Studio that nobody uses.

We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
Source added! Unfortunately, I’m only using circular orbits to avoid the n-body problem math. Maybe one day...
I'm subscribed to /r/python and a bunch of science subreddits, hence my confusion.
Still a great project! Very fun to watch. I bet you could make some lovely animations/loading gifs with this starting point if you wished. Thanks for the source!
Updated, thank you :D
X post this to /r/llupeigettingroasted they love it
This is pretty sweet minus the lack of screenshot ;)
So what is it actually “doing”, you’re failing to explain that
Did you misspell that? That subreddit doesn't exist.
Orange man bad, Orange man like Putin.
That’s just not true! The part where you say you just need to learn to add I mean. For example, neural nets use matrix multiplication all over. If you don’t understand matrix multiplication you can’t understand how a neural net works.
Or, what ordinary people would call, a screenshot 
 Omg thank you! This is great to hear 😁

I don't think you know what the word bigotry means.
Something like that really isn't that much black magic, just extremely time consuming. I think people are scared of [reading anything like this](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/GIF/spec-gif89a.txt) but if you actually have to dig into it, these specs are usually pretty well laid out and make sense. With images, the hard part wouldn't be parsing the file format nearly as much as implementing the decompression and compression algorithm to read and write the files.
I started looking into it but isn't it mostly for frontend applications with a little bit of backend? I am not a Python expert so I don't know. Also, regardless of this is it too heavy for an AWS Lambda function? For example, the AWS Lambdas have a cold start time and I can get by with calling another Lambda which pings them, so there is a way around that if it is an issue, but is Django still very heavy compared to SQLAlchemy? Does anyone have any experience with speed if you added the Django library to Lambda? I found this tutorial (https://blog.apcelent.com/deploy-django-app-aws-lambda.html)

Cool project, don't want to detract from it because it's great and does the job, but you might want to read [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) if you want to use python in a professional environment now or in the future.
If it were not for their occasional usefulness in disabling regions of code, I would say *comments should be removed entirely.* If you want to write a comment, write a function or docstring instead.
Isn't the API private and thus subject to arbitrary change?
Or you know, instead of screenshotting your code, you could post the actual content to gist so peopel don't have to type it out...

The following answers your title but not the content of your post. Securing Devops by Julien Vehent https://www.manning.com/books/securing-devops
Looking at the orbital rates on the code, I think it would need many hours 
That's brilliant. I can also see moons revolving. Venus and Uranus have retrograde orbit ie clockwise. Can you also do that. Sorry I am not able to resist. 
Honestly though, the snake_case vs camelCase thing is entirely not respected in the Python world. PEP8 as a whole is great and should be followed, but that aspect of it you can entirely ignore just like a lot of other people in the Python world. Same goes for line width, insanely many projects ignore the 79/80 character limit (this doesn't meant 200 character lines are okay either.) 
&gt;no point in rediscovering stuff that's already been done Isn't that called...learning? 
Just threw a negative sign for their orbit rates! It looks much better like this too. [https://imgur.com/gallery/0JQ6Dc3](https://imgur.com/gallery/0JQ6Dc3) 
That's cool
What use does if __name__ == '__main__' serve in the program?
Just to help avoid some issues, I am running this on iOS with the Pythonista app and using the included packages to generate the animation. I don’t imagine it would be too difficult to change the packages that handle graphics to suit whatever operating system you are using, but I don’t know of any suggestions.
Ah I see the objc library now. Didn’t peep that. Never knew about pythonista I wanna check it out now. Thanks for the clarification and great job saw this when it was just one planet and this is 9x cooler 
Sure, eventually. As of today they are incredibly popular. Should something replace them it is likely going to have very similar concepts and so knowledge should transfer. If you’re afraid they’ll be replaced in the near future then you haven’t done good research into how much they’re currently used.
That's not even remotely true. Django is essentially Ruby on Rails for the Python world. It's 99% used for the backend, I'd probably hazard to say the majority of Django apps are backend only that exposes a rest api, with the admin frontend being the only Django frontend used. That said, Django includes templating and allows one to do frontend stuff very easily and painlessly. Based on what you described, I actually think Django is the perfect fit. Work through the official Django tutorial and then work through the Django Rest Framework official tutorial. It will give you exactly what you want in a super easy to use and powerful way. 
Well, it's like python on computers but without pip
Out of curiosity, what prompted you to ask this question?
This is standard to python. This conditional will evaluate to true if the python module is being called directly from the console. If this code were to be called from another python module it would evaluate to the name given to the file and return false meaning the code wouldn’t execute until the main() function was called explicitly. [Link to a stackoverflow explanation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/419163/what-does-if-name-main-do) 
Also, why is pixelToCharacterScale a float?
Never thought about it that way, since I started learning programming I've always been told to always comment my code, even the most obvious parts. 
Follow the guide when you can, break it whenever another way is better. &gt; A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds Weird how people always forget that part. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M
If you look under the hood of numpy, you'll find some linear algebra code written in Fortran. Yes, Fortran. The high level wrapper might change but some numerical code will never go away.

Look at the posting history of "OP" and tell me that it isn't a sock puppet. 
yeah my project could get bricked at any time, but I've done this mostly for fun and to learn how to make a PyPI package. I also learned how to use sphinx for automatic documentation of my code. I think I've learned the best way to structure the modules, and I'll be using this project as a template for how all my future projects will be structured. 
The post I first saw with this idea, below, used a package cairo to handle generating an image per frame. They then merged those to a GIF I believe.

Love this, thanks for sharing! I particularly love how it works in Pythonista which is so handy for learning and mucking about with ideas but has some limitations for my interests (no Pandas or SciPy).
I've found [this book (PDF warning)](https://doc.lagout.org/programmation/python/Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms%20in%20Python%20[Goodrich,%20Tamassia%20&amp;%20Goldwasser%202013-03-18].pdf) helpful. Also, $25 a month for all of the content (including, but not limited to Python from literal scratch) at https://www.teamtreehouse.com is money well spent. I think their referral program gives new accounts a month free or a discount, PM me if you want a referral link.

What’s pythonista? Interesting. 
is this not a simulation? it's just a projection of known values? there isn't any physics in it as far as i can tell, it just assumes a known position and calculates the next step. There isn't any interaction between the orbital bodies thorugh their central potentials.
No problem! I only mention it because it can be a legitimate issue in interviews if you don't know it. PEP8 is predominant in the work world, for good reason. It makes it really easy to walk into a job and know the style they use from the get go. One of Python's strengths is having an official style guide IMO. Your code is clean and fine as is, but it's just a good thing to know if python is part of a career choice, and you won't see PEP8 nearly as much in academia.
Everything will become obsolete eventually in the grand scheme of things. The question is whether you will outlive the relevance or not.
Thank you OP!
Don't do that, u/arya-nyx is confusing two things: the rotation around the sun, and the rotation around their orbits. All planets are prograde around the Sun, Vemus and Uranus are retrograde around themselves.
I mean, every distances and rotation rates are wrong here. Of course there is no actual physics. It just a good looking animation of some circles turning around other circles.
I would suggest you drop the cosine and sine calculation, in favor of Euler's formula; it's the right math tool to make things loop around a circle. You would avoid the manual 360 adjustment that you are doing. If you are into signal processing, this would help you understand the Fourier transform.
`jpeg.convert(mode = 'L')` Should be: `jpeg = jpeg.convert(mode = 'L')` [convert returns a converted copy of the image.](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/5.3.x/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.convert) This is why `brightness` is a list instead of an integer like it would be if the image was grayscale. `brightness[0]` is returning the red band of a RGB image. You can use `print(jpeg.mode)` to see the mode of an image that is not loaded.
I feel like I've being trolled
I did camel case a lot, but now find snake_case to be a little easier to read. So much so that I employ it in other languages and SQL, if possible. 
Great! Now do the other way round.
If you're using django https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/signals/ OR sqlalchemy https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/events.html
Add some trails for the planets. It would be more awesome
Pip is itself an example of this- albeit a complicated one! If you want to do it properly you should look into Python packaging and “entry_points”. There’s no requirement to share/distribute your package via pip, even if you’re taking advantage of all the packaging features. See: https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command-line-scripts.html

Sweet thank you
I'm not exactly sure how this is implemented on the low level for Python but this is called augmented arithmetic assignment. While you achieve the same result (they are equivalent), they are not the same (equal). The first one (using `__add__` method) require more operations: loading the number stored in the variable n, performing arithmetic operation with it (without changing the loaded number i.e. holding it temporary), and then storing this result to the variable n. The latter (using `__iadd__` method) is simpler: loading the number, performing arithmetic operation on the loaded number and storing it.

n = n + 1 n += 1 It is a shorthand for common increasing values: **Add 1** to the **old n** and **assign the result to n.** This can be handy when accumulating something in a loop, for example how many numbers are larger than 9 in a list of numbers: def count_larger_than_9(numbers): count = 0 for number in number: if number &gt; 9: count += 1 return count You can do the same for common (numeric) operators. 
All tech can be replaced by something else or become obsolete. However, learning the principles and logic of that tech is worthwhile, for example, it would help you to judge weaknesses and strengths of a future tech and decide when/if to switch. Even to be able to develop the new tech yourself if you are knowledgeable about use cases and weaknesses of this one : )
iOS Python app. Really good.
Take a phone picture of the screen shot open in MS Paint.
The problem is, there are so many ~~idiots~~ people who unironically post screen shots of their code that [it is impossible to tell whether this person is being ironic or not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law).
In university assignments etc that can be helpful, since you're still learning how to properly name variables/functions/etc, and you need to make it EXTREMELY clear to the person grading your code what you're *trying* to do (especially if you have a bug! I always was more lenient on point deduction if I could understand what they were going for and they just had an off-by-one error or something). The advice above is more for production codebases, which are usually so large and cumbersome that extra, superfluous comments just become extra noise that's just one more thing to have to mentally filter out.
**Poe's law** Poe's law is an adage of Internet culture stating that, without a clear indicator of the author's intent, it is impossible to create a parody of extreme views so obviously exaggerated that it cannot be mistaken by some readers for a sincere expression of the parodied views.The original statement of the adage, by Nathan Poe, was: Without a winking smiley or other blatant display of humor, it is utterly impossible to parody a Creationist in such a way that someone won't mistake for the genuine article. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Damn. I think this is exactly what I needed. Thank you. I guess my next step is to email my professor and find good practice materials! 
Thanks, I was reading the docs and just didn't read that far down.
For this past hour; I have spent time looking for the reason as to why I was getting a index error "List index out of range". Adamant, it should work out perfectly because I've quadruple checked the index I'm searching for exists. "Apparently" it didn't. Must be an IDE thing? Naahhhhhh List = ["A," "B", "C"] I'm dead.
Yeah that makes a lot of sense. I’m going to go back to the early lectures and programming assignments and do them over again! 
I do feel like I’m taking a pretty large step, unfortunately. Since it’s for Computational Linguistics we’ve kind of jumped right into the programming aspect and I feel we haven’t learned a strong foundation. So I’m going to do what you suggest and try different programs to help. 
Learning from others is valuable, it often saves time if done properly, since you stand on their shoulders and use as axioms what they discovered by trial and error. But this doesn't mean that self-education is impossible. Scratch a personal itch - try writing some little tool that you need but lack. There's a risk that you will be reinventing the wheel - a lot of software that is useful has been already written. However, this is the best learning experience. And I'm sure your professor will be much happier to give you directions if you rather approach him with questions like "I am trying to write a program that accomplishes this particular task, but I'm stuck with this thing, what should I do?".
[Here you go](https://i.redd.it/x3xa3ferx6t11.jpg)
Pay no attention -- it is terrible advice. Comments are great, you need them, you just need **good** comments. Good comments should explain **why** you do things, not merely repeat what is self-evident from the code: # bad comment idx += 1 # add 1 to idx Well duh, but why am I adding 1? Explain why: idx += 1 # Advance to the next position. idx += 1 # We need idx to be in 1-based form, but it is 0-based. idx += 1 # Fix bug #123456 are all good comments. "Use comments to disable regions of code" -- no. Apart from *really temporarily*, as in lasting no more than a short debugging session, don't do this. Leaving dead code in your programs because "well, I might need it again some day" is a terrible practice. That's what revision control is for. Or copy it into a snippet folder. Don't leave obsolete code in your program, as comments or not. Docstrings *are* comments. If code needs a comment, it will need a comment whether it is in a function or not. It is true that *very occasionally* you can avoid a comment by moving the code into a named function: # don't do this: # bogonate the aardvark x = spam.eggs(cheese)[aardvark] # better def bogonate(obj): return spam.eggs(cheese)[obj] x = bogonate(aardvark) but few non-trivial functions have a name so short and self-explanatory that they don't need a comment. (What the hell does bogonate mean?) 
Pep8 is fine, but I wouldn't be too worried about it. This is nice looking code, and no one is really going to complain if you use camelCase instead of snake_case.
It's probably technically possible, you could make an app with [Kivy](https://kivy.org/), compile it with [python-for-android](https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android) and access the necessary java apis with [pyjnius](https://github.com/kivy/pyjnius). This should be possible without explicitly writing any Java code, although it might be necessary (or just simpler) to write a small amount. In fact the Kivy part isn't essential either, the app could just run without a gui if all you care about is receiving phone calls. However, this would be a little off the beaten track. You wouldn't be able to avoid reading about and understanding how you would do this in a Java app (because the pyjnius method would be using the same functions), plus there could be issues along the way around how the app is packaged and run. I don't really know if there could be real problems there. So overall, it could be interesting to try, but probably wouldn't be straightforward.
Thanks for sharing!
I really hate the 79/80 character limit for a line in pep-8 though.
Looks super good 
FWIW, JetBrains offers PyCharm IDE free to students. It’s pretty amazing IDE IMHO. 
AKA: If your loop is in a dependency, then it doesn't count! 
i see a couple of things here: * You need a camera you can develop with and can access internet (rasberry pi: setting this up is probably the trickiest part) * That then needs to process video frame by frame to check if there is a face in each frame ( think a while loop that grabs last frame and sends to aws rekognition detect faces api -- will need to convert image to bytes to send in json) * Grab coordinates of detected faces and crop frame (python pillow package) * Send cropped face to its final destination (s3 file storage, sms)
Ohh I screwed up. I was wondering why it wasn’t lol

In terms of the function it's a return value that tells if reading was successfull
Actually I tried removing it but it gives some strange error cvtColor takes a tuple as input So i thought maybe the preceding underscore converts it to a tuple but don't actually know
a better practice would be to use: frame = cap. read()[1]
The creator of pandas is trying to make it obsolete, redesigning it from the ground up for performance. However, I don't see numpy becoming obsolete for as long as python's around. All of the matrix manipulation stuff is handled by the same underlying C and Fortran libraries which have been used by every other matrix algebra package for years, so there's nothing likely to overtake it in that respect, and it's so deeply ingrained within the community that other libraries solving similar problems basically have to copy numpy's API.

That's simple pattern matching, not AI lol.
What were some of the advantages and challenges you encountered while using Python and Pygame?
What would be the reasoning to use this instead of indexing? Seems like a really dumb idea, and a convention I never heard of
That is interesting to read about pandas ... I didn't know this was underway. If so, I think that is a good project. Although numpy is gold, pandas has a LOT of flaws, ranging all of the way from memory pigging to display limits (try putting a little title on your dataframe). I think I am going to go find the status of this new project.
I've pretty much only used Python/Pygame. I've tried other languages but I always go back to Python. The syntax is great. Pygame itself is super simple, which makes it easy to do everything the way I want to instead of using someone else's framework (eg: unity). Pygame can be a bit slow when it comes to rendering stuff, but since I use pixel art and scale the resolution, it runs pretty well. I didn't find anything in particular difficult because I was using Python and Pygame. I'm used to optimizing my games and it doesn't take much effort, so I pretty much ignore Pygame's slow rendering at this point.
Yes they will be and so will you be. Not to sound morbid but everything eventually dies. Of the items listed Scikit-learn will likely be replaced by new tech soon. There is just too much happening in the world of machine learning and to have confidence in anything. This even more so because we don’t have a dominate hardware solution for ML acceleration, the successfull lib of the future will likely be tied to a hard ware solution. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Python_software#Applications
I think [this is it](https://pandas-dev.github.io/pandas2/), although the design docs repo hasn't been updated in a couple of years so maybe it was a non-starter.
I don't think so. I don't think Pygame can do that.
Huh. Wikipedia *does* have everything.

&gt; What would be the reasoning to use this instead of indexing? personal preference i guess. a couple things i can imagine people saying are: 1. the developer is explicitly ignoring a value and that they are aware of what the method/function returns 2. having the unpacking upfront signals immediately to whoever reads the code where the values are coming from. after staring at code all day brackets following braces can be easier to overlook for whatever reason, so it might prevent a few hiccups here and there 3. 2 less characters of typing &gt; Seems like a really dumb idea 
this is awesome! may I ask for an explanation on how you handled collisions so well?
I know Gimp, OpenOffice and Blender use Python
Got me curious, so I bit. `digitize` was a wonderful suggestion! I sort of halfassed the `pixel_scale` but I really like how the rest turned out.

(or do above instead, then no need) for l in list(g)[::pixel_scale]: print(''.join(list(l)[::pixel_scale])) if __name__ == '__main__': main()% (textimg) ➜ python img2text.py ./7.jpg =====================================+=====+++++++++++++++++++++ =========================================++=++=+++++++++++++++++ ==========================+++=+|::||+=+=====++++++++++++++++++++ =======================+|||:|:.. :|++===++=++++++++++++++++++ ======================+||:..... .|=+===+++++++++++++++++++ ====================+|::.. ..... .+====+=+++++++++++++++++ ===================++|:.. ... |+=+=++++++++++++++++++ ===================+::: .. . |+==++++++++++++++++++ ==================+|:.. .... . .... +=+=+++++++++++++++++ =================+|::. .:........... |==+++++++++++++++++ =================+::.. .::.:....... ++=++++++++++++++++ =================|:.. .:::......... .+==+++++++++++++++ ================||:. .|=+||::..... :++=++++++++++++++ ================|:. .+=33=+|..... . .|++++++++++++++++ ===============+|:.. |3##333=|:.... :++++++++++++++++ ===============|:. :3####33==+:.... .|+++++++++++++++ ===============|:. .=######33=+|:.. :+++++++++++++++ ==============+::. |#######33=+|:... .|+++=++++++++++ ==============|::..++3#@###33=++|. .++++++++++++++ ==============|.:.:33||3@##33==+|. .:+++++++++++++ =============+|.: :==3=+##3=|:.... .|++++++++++++ ==============:.. ..|.:=##=:::||||. .:++++++++++++ ============++... |+#::+##|.:++|::. :|+++++++++++ =============:...:33===3#=..|:=. . .|+++++++++++ ============+:.. =#######|..++3 . :+++++++++++ ============+:. .#######3:.:+==|:.... :+++++++++++ ============|:. |#######+:.|+===+|:.. .+++++++++++ ============|: .+####3##|..|=====+:. |++++++++++ ============:: :##3+3##|.:|=333=|:. |++++++++++ ============:.. 3=+|3==....=33=+|.. :++++++++++ ============|.. ++:3##+:...:=3=+:. :++++++++++ ============|.. :=|+3#3=|:::|=+|:. .++++++++++ ============+:....3==+=+::...:|+:.. .+++++++++| =============|....+33=@@#=:....+:. ..+++++++++| =============+.....33=333+:..:|+:. .++++++++++ ==============:....=3=33+|:.::+|.. . .|+++++++|| =============+:....:#3++|::.::|... . .:++++++++| =============+::....##3=+|::::... .:|++++++|| =============+::.. .=##3=+||.... .|+++++++| ============+|::....:333=+|.. ||+++++|| =============:::.. ..:+++:.... .:. .. .|+++|+|| =============::.. . . :::..... .|....... .:|+|||| =============::... . . .::::: . :|..::::.. . :|+||| =============|.... ... ::::. . :|.:||::... . .||||| =============|.. ..... .:|:....+.+=+||::.. . :|||| =============|.. .. .. :::...|.+==+||::... |||| =============|.. ... .....:===++|:::... . :||| =============+: . ....:===++||::.... :||| ====+=========: . . ...::====++|::.... ..||| +=+==========+|. .. .....=33==++|:.... .:||| ++==++=====+=||.. .. ...=3333=++|:... ..||| +++===+==+=++|||:. .. ....+3333==++|:.. ..::|| +==++====+|:::|=+.. . ...33333==++|:... ..:||| +=+==++|:.......:.... ...+33333==+|::.. ..:||| =+=+=+:.............. ...33333==+||:... .::||| +++++::.......... ... ..=33333==+|::.. ..:||| ++++||:....... .. . ..:33333==+||:.. ..::|| +++:|:::..... . .=3333==++|::.. ...::|| ++|:::::..... .:33333=++|::.. ...:::| =||::::...... 33333==+||:... .....::| +|::::... ... |3333==++|:... ......::: ||::..... .. .3333===+|::.. ......::: :|::..... .. . .33333==+||::.. . .....::: ::::..... .. . =3333==++|::.. ......:: .:::...... . .. |3333==++||:... ......:: :::::..... . .. :3333===+||::... ........ :::.... .. .33333==++|::... ... ........ ::..... .. +333===++||::... ..... ......... 
disagree, that's a way worse practice.
I actually just made a video on this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_YTklVVNoQ The short answer is that I move and handle 1 axis at a time. Doing 1 axis at a time, you can use the movement on that axis to tell where to pop the player out when it collides with a tile. Pygame's `Rect` class makes this pretty easy since you can do something like `player_rect.right = tile_rect.left`.

You could always try to port the game to kivy ;).
exactly. works great &gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy as NUMPY &gt;&gt;&gt; NUMPY.__dict__['DIGITIZE'] = NUMPY.digitize &gt;&gt;&gt; NUMPY.DIGITIZE(NUMPY.array([1, 11, 21]), [0, 10, 20]) array([1, 2, 3]) 
Man Id love to create something like this... but I’m super new to python (half a semester in). Where should I look to get started? What are some online resources or tutorials you would recommend? This looks awesome, great work!
Maybe you could rewrite it a little in Cython? Now I don't know if that would work; it's just an idea.

I learned using [this](https://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/) when I was 12. It's a great tutorial and it's very easy to follow. Unfortunately, there aren't many tutorials on more advanced topics at the moment. I'm planning on putting some videos on advanced topics out in the future.
that would be awesome, in the meantime I’ll get deep in this link. thank you for the tips!
You literally wrote a program that can compile an image why the fuck did you take a screenshot with your phone?
I've always thought that as well, in a lot of cases you're just moving the nested loop to some other code and adding unneeded dependencies
