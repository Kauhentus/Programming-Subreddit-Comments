Yeah most of us have this problem to some degree. You‚Äôre not alone. If you want a psychological approach you can use this weird technique called EFT to ease your lizard brain out of its paralysis: https://youtu.be/LwgFIKjTpWY When I do this all of the paralysis goes away and I don‚Äôt feel any of the angst over the process and the choices become clear. Otherwise I agree about picking the smallest one. Also give yourself a short timeframe like 1 day to finish a prototype then move on to the next one and come back to it later if you are in the mood.
433.000 rows would it be right now, since I'm not that confident with all the db stuff my trys always ran about 3-4 minutes for one world, which would be around 20-30 minutes for all.
yes, I tried postgres with asyncpg

If all you are doing is extracting links, I'd consider using BeautifulSoup. You can set up a lambda to trigger off the S3 upload, that'll prefill the lambda's event with the s3 location. Then bs4 to load and parse out links. From there you can either have your lambda load direct into something like Redshift, or just drop a csv into a s3 that gets batch uploaded each hour/night/week/whatever.
umm pretty barbaric I guess, my hosting service has a graphic interface which shows the ram usage, and since its never rises permantly it doesnt look like I fucked it up somewhere. I tested my new "update" locally and simply ran the script with my IDE and look how much RAM the python process used. Then I ran my old script again to compare, even tho the numbers are different to the ones on the server, the RAM difference is pretty much the same my dictionary has 3 different types of "data dicts": (13 int, 1 str) (12 int, 2 str) (5int, 1str), like I said I never really learned it professional so I have no clue if that info helps you\^\^
I don't really think my code would help you, I store exactly the data I have to, and since its only for a little dying browsergame there's no chance that it will be that much bigger in future
Okayyyyy; I really doubt that a database could possibly be too slow for what you want to do and the RAM useage you described is atrocious but if you don't want to ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
You're using a completely different System Tray package. It's not PySimpleGUI. &amp;#x200B;
You would be more likely using PS from within a tool like Salt (Python based) than this 
"If I were a user, would it be easier or harder to find this object if it were in a separate module?" "If I were a new developer working in this project, would it be easier or harder to find this object if it were in a separate module?" Remember that you can always split objects out into different files and keep them importable from the original module, by importing them in the original module.
it wouldn't hurt but a lot of the design pattern stuff described in that book are largely features of newer languages(iterator related patterns) or are not needed(adapter). You could [watch this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvYrdvmgS1oe3zMPqqL7ySclgI9KKv9oa) and get the gist &amp;#x200B; IMO, books like [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882), [Code Complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Complete), or [Refactoring by Martin](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html) Fowler would bear more fruit even though they are not related to python at all, but just general universally applicable programming/design skills. &amp;#x200B; And again, MY OPINION, learn a Lisp. Even if you don't use it in your daily work will open your mind to new concepts and some of those can be applied to python or any other language. Try [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) or [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/)
I recently used pony for a small project and found it to be pretty nice but you should also check out sqldict. 
Some editors have an option named something like smart-tabs which will cause a backspace from the first non-blank in a line to undent by 4 spaces. If your editor does not, consider using a different editor. Do not replace multiple spaces by tabs. Instead, set tab type to spaces with a tab size of your choice, but preferably 4 spaces.

Awesome script. And those channels in your example output are pretty damn good if I say so myself :)

The 3.X line of upgrades have been very weird. Throughout 1.X and 2.X the devs cared very heavily about both forward and backwards compatibility. In 3.X 0 shits are given for forward compatibility and cares for backwards compatibility is going down and down. 
&gt;\[...\] or query entries by certain values \[...\] Go with SQLite. You could think of it as a text file with easy lookup method. Don't forget to use indexes. You might want to use Full Text Search.
If you're going to do analysis, then SQLite may be the way to go. Makes it easy to delete old data off the end with a simple SQL command. On the other hand, depending on what your going to analyze, maintaining a .csv file and loading it all into one of the Python Numerical Analysis tools may be the way to go. Depends on what you intend to do with this file. An 8 to 9 million line file (or row database) is not particularly large (assuming the amount of data logged on each line is not enormous). &amp;#x200B;
Wow. Thank you didn't expect to see a reply from you! Your videos are extremely helpful. 
really? interesting. I've always preferred bpython but thought ironpython was preferred by the community
Right, well the **del** and **gc** calls do not flush immediately... personally I'd try to debug it by stripping back to the Pandas call and seeing if you can recreate with Dask completely out of the way... the problem may be Dask's use of the Pandas call (there are quite a few arguments on that thing), or it may be an underlying issue with Pandas.
**Look out for circular dependencies**. When you create some utility functions and you start dividing them, you might find yourself in a situation, where X and Y are different things functionally, but they somehow work together. I often find myself creating 3 modules in such situations. 1. module X 2. module Y 3. module XY, imports X and Y

This is amazing
If you need to perform complex queries on the data and relationships in the data (e.g. "give me the number of days in the past month when logs with the text `foo` outnumbered logs with the text `bar`, only counting logs from IPs in America"), then a relational database could be the way to go. If you're just interested answering questions like "how many times was the text `foo` logged in the past month" (e.g. simply counting occurrences), you'd be fine to just log to a text file and use `grep` and `wc` and other command line tools to answer your questions. &gt; I'm not sure how large can a text file become before it starts to slow things down? File size won't affect the time taken to append data to the file &gt; Or before it becomes unreadable\hardly readable? Or if it's read line by line it can be multiple GBs and still be processed fairly quickly? It'll be fine if you just pipe the file through command-line tools. They'll process it line-by-line. The same applies for python, if you iterate over the lines with ``` for line in open(filename).read(): do_stuff(line) ```

If so, low-level with Flask may be fine. In which case ask in /r/flask /r/remigui is also very easy to use. Do you have static rendering logic for the calendar? Meaning how would the calendar look with some dummy data? You may also find you get more help in /r/learnpython 
I mean, those organizations would be using docstring types √† la Google, so what we're really talking about is if the types are in the signature or in the docstring.
I'm not a Spyder user, but the standard shortcut to dedent a line or block of code is usually shift+tab in most graphical IDEs. As others have said, some editors have smart indents and will dedent on backspace, but this is probably still worth a try. And do not switch to tabs. 
 No hotels super-close. I would recommend staying in Midtown or Brentwood neighborhoods. Those are short ride from the venue.
Why the "inside one widget" limitation? You can nest QWidgets arbitrarily, so you can build your game as a widget containing more widgets.
The GUI I have right now uses QtabWidget and my idea is to have like a very basic version of retro-pie in one of the tabs.
Thank you!
So? You can nest any amount of widgets inside a single widget, and then put that widget inside your QTabWidget.
That'd be perfect. Like a browser that runs the game that is selected. Any ideas on how I could do that? There seem to be a lot of python games out there
You won't be able to just run any game that's out there - even if you find an open source game, it will need to be customized to run in your environment.
Ok. Maybe I'm in a bit too deep with this. Im pretty new to python coding and GUI/Visual coding like this.
Everyone else is wrong! Pip-tools and [these zsh functions](https://github.com/AndydeCleyre/dotfiles/blob/master/.python.zshrc) √ºber alles! 
You are updating all 433k entries each second? If you don't know SQL it would probably need some learning to do proper batches and transactions to speed up the updates. I doubt sqlite can't handle your task in reasonable time. You are sparse with details so all is guesswork. Bit you did you are optimizing as a hobby. Give proper SQL a shot.
I got in trouble that way once Never again since then
yes that could be an idea. Thanks Is that all I should keep in mind?
Care to tell us what exactly you do update? What is in there?
What about [this](https://youtu.be/8-Vhj6XJW3A) ?
The biggest problem with these books is that they fail to mention that many of the design patterns are highly language specific. For example, Builder is really a workaround for the fact that in C++ object constructors are not polymorphic. But they never tell you that. Most of the patterns in books designed around C++/Java become trivial in Python once you understand first class functions and first class classes, or just structured completely differently. Instead of those books, the best thing to read on this subject that I have come across is [Brandon Rhode's Python Patterns](https://python-patterns.guide/).
Intuitive. 
Design patterns are less useful as python is dynamic The creational patterns like factory are still useful.
&gt; Having worked at a company that depends on python for very large systems that pass through the hands of dozens of engineers, python can become hopelessly abstract Does unit (or other forms of) testing not insure system robustness moreso than type hints? 
It would probably be easiest to create a list to hold your paragraph objects and then append your paragraph objects to the list as you create them: E.g. paragraph_list = [] paragraph = document.add_paragraph(‚Äòtext‚Äô) paragraph_list.append(paragraph)
I try to keep track of [useful OOP things](https://github.com/metaperl/python-oop) and looking through the things I've stashed there: * [Atom](https://github.com/nucleic/atom) has observables and perhaps type validation? * [Connectible](https://github.com/timothycrosley/connectable#readme) has observers, but no type validation. 
Unfortunately the best way to interact with webpages, the same way that a regular user would, is through a browser. Selenium is the easiest way to do that. If you want to torture yourself, write js instead and run it in headless chromium/puppeteer or phantomjs.
Ok thanks
&gt; IMO, books like Clean Code, Code Complete, or Refactoring by Martin Fowler would bear more fruit even though they are not related to python at all, but just general universally applicable programming/design skills. In a similar vein [refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru/) might be useful too.
At work we have a system that looks for people who have checked out files that might be affected when another person commits. It then emails those people saying they might wanna sync. It's kind of useful I guess.
I think that is the wrong way to look at it. Type annotations are metadata. One completely valid use-case is to streamline unit testing and make the process of writing them much faster. For example, if you are writing a binary serializer and are bound to types by the fundamental requirements of the spec, type safety is mandatory. Type hints mean that the code for your unit tests can be generic and test against the hints instead of the contriving a case for each type. You can take this a step further with custom exceptions, or meaningful flow control based on a systems adherence to type-hints. It means that you are not bound to static typing vs dynamic typing as a binary choice. You have the ability to express how your systems should be sensitive to type. ie. type hints improve the expressiveness of the language with regard to value types. That is a good thing, as there are plenty of places where type cannot be ignored. Now, how do you want to handle that context? Unit tests, exceptions, logging, or some other mechanism; it‚Äôs all up to you. You are free to enforce guarantees where or when necessary, or build any context around type sensitivity that you like.
If you can update your question with more detail we might be able to help you. It's always better to explain the overall concept of what you're trying to achieve, that way people can give you alternatives that might work even if your current approach is a dead end. Specifically I'm wondering *what kind of games?* Qt-native? Browser? You can totally write games with Qt though it's not that straightforward. Embedded browser games in a widget is possible, but the Qt browser can be limited (do the games need any plugins for example?)

Ah, right. Sorry. First time poster in this sub. &amp;#x200B; So I'm building my own replica of a Fallout pip-boy, specifically the one from fallout 2, handheld thing.

Its ok, theres a whole year until 2.7 EOL!
Design patterns are still useful in Python, because they help others to understand your code. Using a common set of idioms makes it easier to interpret and see when things go right or go wrong. For example, one of these is more readable than the other to a typical Python programmer (and although they're all different, do mostly the same thing): import sys x = 0 mylist = ["Apple", "Orange", "Banana"] while x &lt;= 2: sys.stdout.write(mylist[x]) sys.stdout.flush() x = x + 1 versus mylist = ["Apple", "Orange", "Banana"] for item in mylist: print(item) versus mylist = ["Apple", "Orange", "Banana"] print("\n".join(mylist))
Try looking up sqlalchemy or pypyodbc packages if you want to connect to a database, though you can probably get pretty far by just talking to your org's IT.
The only thing that comes to my head is 'generators' https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators/ and enumerate() https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate but I can't wrap my head around your code, not my day, sorry :(
We're referring to the design patterns in Gamma. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns
So, this might be controversial, but I'd say you should avoid older design pattern books. As others have mentioned, many were created to work around limitations in C++ (and later, earlier versions of Java). In my many years of working with Python code, when I see some of those old-school OO patterns show up in Python code, it's usually a code-smell, because there's a more Pythonic way of doing the same thing. 
We're officially in the second decade of Python3. It should always be assumed any project still using 2.7 has made a permanent decision not to upgrade, even when someone says they're working on it.
My understanding as we were referring to the concept of design patterns. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern
Well EOL means nothing in business. There's even talks of businesses forking 2.7 to self-patch it as needed rather than pay the price of a long and painful upgrade.
is there any one have testing this frame work
&gt;I don't really think my code would help you 999 times out of 1000, it would. If the people you're asking for help ask for your code, it's because you didn't provide enough information to help answer your question, and code is one of the best ways to fill in the blanks.
I like to automate stuff and do "internet things" (like bots/web scraping). I would like to make some game bots (only where it's permitted of course) and maybe something Telegram-related (as in bots/games/channels etc). Maybe I could try some game-developing but I don't feel like I am creative enough to do so.
What format are the databases in?
Python is a dynamic language. Type enforcement is left out by design. Type hints are great for enterprise code when used with capable IDE's. It makes changes by other developers easier, refactoring easier, and debugging easier (among others) but requires an initial investment that for small scripts/projects isn't worth the time/cost. IMO dynamic typing is awesome. The most prevalent complaints about python are from people who have read a terrible article at some point and have adopted incorrect ideas about the language. Or have failed to understand the basic tenants of the language itself/how to use it. (obviously, these are my opinions based on observations and not necessarily based on collected data).
I use Pandas/Pyarrow for enterprise projects that deal with data files. Pyarrow/parquet is set to be the default file format for Pandas when the 1.0 release hits sometime this year. Have used it with ETL projects that have 100GB+/Billion+ row files.
Just curious, what sort of screen are you using and where did you source it?

I will answer this tomorrow! Thanks for reply. &amp;#x200B; Mille
If you need create not math graphs you can read about pyglet (openGL implementation as far as I remember), Bokeh (very interesting due to generating html-files with simple GUI, but it is not for your case) or PyOpenGL. My first reply on Redditüòä
No, just about 5-6 variables like ip, hash string, date string. &amp;#x200B; I'm more concerned about write speeds than read speeds here, it should be able to post this data as quickly as possible. It's threaded on the client-side, so it does not block the UI, but the faster it happens on the server side the sooner some UI parts will update.
I agree with this. This issue would be the processing time of text in, even if log was in a good format. There are some disadvantages of sqlite over a real DB, but it is worlds above a text file. One thing I haven't tried and wonder how it works is sqlite -&gt; Pandas. You can also use an ORM like SQLAlchemy if desired to make things simpler and more portable to real DBs. For running your tests, you can spawn a sqlite DB that is in memory only.
I knew that the 'query' word may trigger some people to immediately suggest SQLite. So I'd like to point out again that this is not required much, I'm more concerned about write speeds. I can download any file and process it locally if I need these specific queries, on a machine with enough ram. &amp;#x200B; So I'd go with sqlite if write speeds were the same. But if write speed suffers I'd prefer text file.
Fyi, with requests, instead of json_data = json.loads(response2.text) You can just do json_data = response2.json() Which is handy. 
On what kind of hardware? I'm talking about a VPS here
Suggest PostgreSQL or ElasticSearch. Get the feeling you want this all in one system/app/vm/container. I find that SQLite is great for dev or proof of concept, but things take off once you have users. Regardless, best of luck.
Thanks. I have daemon tools. Can I install linux with just that and no usb?
If you‚Äôre doing analysis on it and storing it as a csv file, take a look at the pandas python module. I‚Äôm pretty sure it does what you want.
Yep that's great thanks :) So, yes if you don't want to go to the both of creating the games yourself (totally not worth it for a prop) I think the best bet would be to use web games, in a browser widget. You can load local resources (HTML/CSS/JS) in a browser widget, so this wouldn't need an internet connection. I have a working tabbed browser example here: https://github.com/mfitzp/15-minute-apps/tree/master/browser_tabbed ... in that the UI is coded, but the general principal is you want a QTabWidget with multiple QWebEngineView (for &gt;=PyQt5.6) inside, loading the games. For the games themselves I'd search for "simple js &lt;game&gt;" ‚Äî e.g. "simple js tetris" gives me this https://codeincomplete.com/games/tetris/ and look for those that don't use external resources. 
A DeprectationWarning is the *opposite* of "not caring about backwards compatibility". The decision to move these was made literally years ago, and the phased deprecation over multiple Python versions is used expressly to avoid another massive break-all-the-things moment like 2-&gt;3 (which was caused mainly by letting tech debt accumulate to the point where cutting losses was the best way forward).
&gt; when my else statement runs to run my "first()" function it keeps the value I have stored in there from the first run through (Variable "answer") This is description of the problem seems unclear. If you posted a sample output of what you get vs what you want that would help, including printing out the value of Answer/other before the if/else blocks so you can be sure what you typed exactly matches what you're checking against. Also, your code might look a little cleaner with an explicit loop in it. Maybe something like this: def main(): while True: inp = input("What to run? (A/B): ) if inp[0].upper() == 'A': runA() else: runB() # Add Additional options here inp = input("Would you like to stop? (yes/NO): ") if inp[0].upper() == 'Y': break # if __name__ == '__main__': main()
When a module is imported, it is cached. Each subsequent import references that cached instance.
This specific case isn't about backwards compatibility, it's about forward compatibility, and there are many more cases of both forwards and backwards compatibility not being cared about. Removing an import location isn't significantly beneficial in any way, and breaking that forward compatibility is weird.
You are speaking about 500 - 5000 entries per day. It's nothing and you wont notice a performance change. [https://sqlite.org/src4/doc/trunk/www/lsmperf.wiki](https://sqlite.org/src4/doc/trunk/www/lsmperf.wiki) You can find plenty of benchmarks for SQLite. I doubt there are any for pure file appends. It's all about reading and analyzing this data. SQL can be a great DSL for your task. How are you going to analyze this log data later on? With other ad-hock python scripts? Opening the file in an editor? If you are concerned with the speed it should be easy to mock the data and test it yourself. You can also take a look at other solutions: [http://www.lmdb.tech/bench/microbench/](http://www.lmdb.tech/bench/microbench/) &amp;#x200B;
Firstly, as you've written the code above, 'answer' should be out of scope when the first() function ends so your program should not be keeping the value of answer. But anyway: The quick and dirty way: answer = None The correct way would be to learn about variable scope and create your variables in a scope that disappears when the block is exited. &amp;#x200B;

Same python flask project will be used to display a web page with stats and JS charts, on another api route. &amp;#x200B; As long as write speed is acceptable it's fine. &amp;#x200B; Yeah, I may be overthinking it and maybe I should just go with sqlite. I can surely benefit with it's smarter query system than my "iterate over each line and gather required data into lists and dicts"
If I get anywhere close to even 5000 users I'll be extremely happy, lol. As far as I know SQLite is capable of much more than that. It is not a web service after all, this database is just to gather some statistics. Only 1 user will be reading from it. Only 1 program will be writing to it. &amp;#x200B; I like SQLite because it's easy to back up, move and use with peewee and it does not require me to run a specialized DB server.
What about SikuliX? Java based with image recognition and complex scripting. It's also cross platform.

I tend to recommend [lubuntu](https://lubuntu.net/) (lightweight Ubuntu). It is a pretty common Linux distribution, and regular Ubuntu is a clear contender for most-used desktop Linux distribution. You can find an [installation guide](https://docs.lubuntu.net/lubuntu_installation) on their website. but to give you a breakdown, for Windows you'd most likely want a piece of free software called [rufus](https://rufus.ie/) to create a bootable usb drive with the lubuntu iso file.
I feel like creating a module with some manager that will hide the SQL queries. It should be much easier to start with SQLite and if performance becomes a problem, you can always migrate it to something else, because you will have the data in a well structured format.
You could try del(ff.a.v) which would reset the value back to 10 every time at the end of the def dd() 
thanks. i understand of static 
Those sure are very specific requirements, and for your purposes building your own might not be that bad of an idea. You could always spend time configuring your own environment emacs, since there _most likely_ exists modules that you could glue together to do exactly what you want. Otherwise, developing your own "simple" IDE isn't actually as hard as you might think. For an easier project you might be able to find some pre-made autocomplete systems (or even python modules) online.
&gt; 'm more concerned about write speeds than read speeds here, SQLite is optimized for read speeds not write speeds. I'd recommend appending text to a file in your case
Yes, totally. Look into [Automate the Boring Stuff](http://automatetheboringstuff.com/).
Based on your question, i will assume that you haven't already set up a database environment. Depending on how big your database has to be, and how often it has to be used, there are **a lot** of options. For really large datasets, that have to be _very_ searchable, [elastic](https://www.elastic.co/) might be the way to go. But since you're a "newbie", you might need to start out, simpler... w3schools has a very simple [guide](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_mysql_getstarted.asp) on how to both create, interact and read mysql type databases. What mysql i, and why to chose it. Might not matter at your current "level" or usecase.
/u/tunisia3507 laid it out pretty well, another way i usually think about it is to separate based on use or "genre" as one would with books. Does your current module handle both both handles a connection, takes data in, and does calculations on it? Well that's three "genres". So split it into three modules.
Developing my own IDE sounds like a fun and rewarding project! Although probably not the best use of my time right now, as I envision spending more time layering more features, less on coding, with probably not much immediate pay-off. Seems like this might be the best time to start learning emacs. Do you have any recommended starter configurations (maybe with some of these requirements in mind) and/or tutorials?
Lububtu or Xubuntu with XFCE/Gnome/Mate. Definitely would get an SSD, and with Linux you don't need high capacity - 32 Gb is probably enough.
Is Python a hard requirement? It's my favorite language too, but in this case the Google Sheets native support for Javascript scripting is pretty tough to ignore. [https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/sheets](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/sheets)
no
Why not Selenium, exactly? Just curious what the reason is, given it does exactly what you are asking for. 
writing isn't a problem. you're writing a small amount of data each day. reading is the only point where there will be a noticeable difference in performance - then it depends if you want to read serially or "at random".
Why do you think it is spam? You're right that I'm not a developer of this tool. To me it looks like a good option for GUI development in Python and I found this tutorial helpful.
Sublime text 3 offers a ton of these features of of the box, or with plugins. Best part is whatever isn't working for you is customizable with code. 
When it comes to emacs, [this visualisation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10942008/what-does-emacs-learning-curve-actually-look-like) of the learning curve of different editors is pretty accurate. If time really is limited, emacs is probably _not_ the correct choice either, but Derek banas made a long [beginners tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iagbv974GlQ) that i found pretty understandable. But you are not going to become a "fluent" emacs user in a day, and configuration might also take some time and a lot of learning.
Check out Atom. Very customizable and lightweight. You can install extensions to do everything you mentioned in your list. More specifically python-autocomplete, hydrogen, hydrogen-python, jupyter console / platformio are some extensions that would cover the majority of your requirements.
What type of database? SQL, noSQL (mongo, couch)?
Alpine Linux is definitely the lightest OS. That's probably too bare-bones for what you're trying to do though. Lubuntu is probably a good bet.
Thats awesome! Each rewrite is an opportunity to improve yourself and your code. Some say that regular refactoring is a sign of healthy code. It wouldn‚Äôt be very fun if it was easy right? If it helps, you‚Äôre heading down the correct path. We‚Äôve all been where you are

So I absolutely need a usb drive? I installed windows before with just daemon tools a disc image file
Ironpython is effectively abandonware. MS moved ownership to ‚Äúthe community‚Äù, which is a gentle way of saying they are not going to work on it anymore. It was never particularly popular, the community has always been fairly small, so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it for new projects... It may or may not jump to 3 at some point, but it‚Äôs clear that the project does not have the resources to keep up with CPython. The fate of IronPython is somewhat similar to Jython, which is effectively a predecessor implementation of the same idea but on the JVM (I believe the original Jython developer was later hired by MS to work on the CLR precisely to improve support for languages other than C#). Jython is also lagging quite severely, and help from Sun/Oracle has always been scarce (despite them shipping old versions of Jython in almost every product!).
In the time it took you to make this post and receive responses, you could have written BOTH ways. 
Because posting a link to documentation with nothing else is spam? If you had a great experience then post about your experience. Make it interesting and unique. Otherwise it just looks like an advertisement or spam. &amp;#x200B;
Ehm, i don't know how you'd do it otherwise, external hard drive? But you might want to look into a [Virtual Machine](https://www.virtualbox.org/)! they're really simple to setup, even simpler to delete. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f2l3j0rF-E) is a youtube video that walks through that whole process (bar the music...)
I guess you need the `pythonnet` package installed, for this to work.
Hi, /r/Python, I thought I could share my first ever computer vision application (and also first GUI Python application). I made it in like 2-3 days as a small side project and it turned out pretty good! It's for processing astronomical images. Astrophotographers often take lots of relatively short images of dim deep sky objects (like galaxies or nebulae), instead of taking a very long-exposure photo - it's much easier to do the former. The next thing to do after capturing images is to process these images, by (most often) averaging pixel values of image stack. That's exactly what my application does. It's not that easy though, because these images often have lots of electronic noise and are misaligned (eg. by tracking imperfections). The electronic noise is easy to remove (by "calibrating" each image - it means to subtract pixel values of bias and dark frames from images) but alignment is harder. I tried to use OpenCV's inbuilt functions for alignment, but they almost always failed. If they didn't fail though, the images were often warped badly. So I had to make my own star alignment algorithm. I came up with an idea to find bright star in reference image and image to be aligned, create triangles between stars and find similar triangles in both images. This method works very well and can align images when they're translated, rotated and even flipped. After image calibration and alignment, my application averages pixel values of pre-processed images, creating a final image with much less noise than a single image (even calibrated one). This photo is then ready to be processed in a program like GIMP or Photoshop. I hope you like my idea, if you have any suggestions of what I could add, please tell me! üòÄ
This is pretty f\*\*\*\*ing neat. I think I just found my new hobby project.
Also use god damn code blocks!
Dude. r/learnpython This subreddit isn't where you ask for help.
Yeah he's not gonna go far running a virtual machine if he can barely start his environment on the bare metal.
If you use Windows, Powershell is now the officially recommended shell, and it is preinstalled (maybe not the very latest version, but a version of PS has been shipped with Windows since 2008 Server / Windows 7). `Cmd.exe` (the classic ‚Äúcommand prompt‚Äù) will probably hang around forever, but it‚Äôs never been good and it‚Äôs more or less in maintenance mode. If you use Linux or MacOS, there is basically no reason to use Powershell unless you come from the Windows world and *really* don‚Äôt want to learn anything new, or if you want to use it to remote onto Windows boxes (but OpenSSH will soon be provided by MS for that sort of thing). Support for these platforms is pretty new, and of course MS prioritize the Windows version.
Go buy yourself a USB stick, or at least a blank DVD (assuming you have a DVD drive). Download Manjaro, Lubuntu, Xubuntu or Mint Linux distros (they're the lightest user friendly distros that you'll find guides for). No you won't be able to install it without external storage, it isn't worth that hassle to try anyway.
He apparently can't even afford a USB stick, not sure an SSD is on the table.
Thanks üòÅ
As a response to whether or not you _had_ to use a USB drive to install or run an operating system, a virtual machine is a completely appropriate alternative. Whether or not it is immediately possible, one can always learn, especially with tutorials and guides as linked.
True, in most cases a virtual machine is a great way to test out an operating system, but it doesn't offer a solution to his problem.
Well, that is what I've managed to find as well, that SQLite is more for reading. That said, though, it's still fast, and I'm just trying to understand whether it's fast **enough** for my use case. And whether I'll benefit from it's more powerful queries or not.
hi, thanks for the reply! I have tried it the first way and i think each time that it loops it resets the variable to None? is that right? Although saying that in the following code it doesnt seem to even get anywhere in the if danny_old_location == None statement. if msg.topic == "MagicClock/Danny": danny_new_location = new_location print("we got into danny") if danny_old_location == None: print("no old location yet") else: print("there is a location") # compare new to old if danny_new_location == danny_old_location: print("do nothing") else: print("do something ") # set the old location to the new location so that on the next loop it is using updated locations danny_old_location = danny_new_location print("set new to old",danny_old_location) 
I have experience with peewee, and it's one of the reasons why I am considering SQLite in the first place.
That is going to be a quick route for you and probable the easiest then. 
From the code in your post, I think you're referring to code idioms as in "idiomatic python style" or sometimes just "pythonic style". i.e. writing things in a way that most python programmers would prefer and be familiar with.
Serially, but I will need to gather and sort data in the process. It may become RAM hungry at some point. Using a few API endpoints to give this data out in chunks may be a better way to go. But then I'm not sure how much RAM I'll need in the first place for my use case. With 9000000 lines txt file is gonna be around 500MBs. But then it's just a worst case scenario estimation for like 2-3 years in the future. I could just convert it into a database at that point. Or I could not even care. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
I haven‚Äôt done this myself, but isn‚Äôt this what beautifulsoup does? I‚Äôm. It familiar with Selenium at all. 
Do you have this on GH?
So, my daughter was tasked with receiving data via FAX and having to enter that data MANUALLY into spreadsheets in order to produce price labels for the retail stores in her company. Needless to say, fecking boring and frustrating. I pointed her towards "Automate the boring stuff". The next thing I know, she's written a data entry screen using ODK which runs on the staff's smartphones and when uploaded to the net, updates the blessed Google spreadsheets for her. She then runs INDEX(MATCH()) against her master spreadsheet, and downloads the resulting spreadsheet using some combination of Python and magic to produce the needed labels. Young people nowadays, they're amazing! So, yeah, Python the arse out of Google Sheets. NB: you will need to run the Python from a machine of some kind, unless Google App Engine supports Python, which I do not know. Also, as /u/JshWright stated, you can also run JavaScript, and AppsScript inside the Google Sheet as well. 
A virtual machine on an already resource constrained machine. I hardly think that this would offer the experience seemed. This would be a step in the wrong direction.
Yes, but for now in a private repo, I want to add some more things before I'll release it 
Like the person earlier said. If your writing a function the variable should only exist during the function in most cases (I say most because I can't read your code but if your passing in a list it gets trickier in Python). That being said `del` also deletes an entire variable
RemindMe! 1 month I'm eager to see your work! 
This is neat, I'm inspired
Dude, this is amazing. As an amateur astrophotographer myself, I'm in love with the idea. Not sure why I never considered writing something to do this. Hope you release it!
Most definitely, i was just trying to mention alternatives to using USB drives as a means to install or use other operating systems.
Can you normalize your data and make it relational? If no dont do it, If yes go for it. There are a ton of usecases for it: cache for a client server database etl. Server side lightweight rdbms. Plain old data structure and container. Data analysis with one of the best time test languages that will be going on 50 years old.
I'm curious as to what gui framework you used.
If you want ideas as to things to add, check out Deep Sky Stacker, which is a program used by astrophotograpers to stack images when not just using lightroom. For the more technical side of things, stacking and combining telescope observations is generally often done with the help of programs like SCAMP, STIFF and SWarp. See the astromatic software page for ideas, if you wanted: https://www.astromatic.net/software

Very nice! We used Python for image processing in my Astronomy major. Compared to IRAF (ancient hard-to-use software) it's so much easier.
Well, as a matter of fact I probably could. But for my use case it will probably only complicate logging process way too much. I basically just need to record ip, mac and license key whenever it's used, to then see usage statistics as well as potentially have a chance to notice if there's any license abuse going on. 
No need to create a manager, there are ORMs for python like peewee or SQLAlchemy.
Honestly this does not sound too bad for a relational setup. You would need to gather all your entities, attributes, and their relationships, but it doesn't not sound like it would be too hard for you to do. While a relation scheme may seem over the top for this it allows you to scale, and create logic that can grow in complexity. Today your track mac addresses, tomorrow you hook it in to your inventory assets and purchasing catalog for licensing alerts.

Just because it isn't on 1.0 doesn't mean the code can't be out there, of course. I might be interested in contributing if you're looking for help!
That's awesome. I've been trying to build something similar to process images from a CCD camera that has electronic noise and has data very similar to astronomical images. What package did you use to build the GUI? I'd also be be interest in checking out your repo!
Python is definitely a great language, and very beginner friendly, but the Google Sheets ecosystem is really built around Javascript, so you'd likely have an easier time using the tools Google already has built in.
Loos pretty cool, but can you explain what reverse polish notation is?
When you say router - do you mean the wireless nic in the computer you're on, or the (home?) router that's providing your internet connection? For the first case, in linux, you can use iwlist and iwconfig system commands to get the wifi strength. These are linux commands, so you'd run them with [subprocess.run](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run) and capture the output as shown. If it's a network router on your LAN, you need to read the docs for the router.
Are you using window machine? Currently Ray does not support windows.
I was. I suppose that‚Äôs the issue then. Thanks for responding. 
Will you do a write up about your process?
Hi there, I want to know the received signal strength indicator of the network card of the computer I am on, in this case my laptop. Unfortunately I am on windows, but maybe I can find a way to do something similar. &amp;#x200B; Thanks!
Figured that out. I saw someone else post in this sub so thought it was fine.
This looks neat, and open source alternatives to popular software are always good to see. What file types are you planning on using? RAW import and 16 or 32-bit TIFF or FITS export is commonly used. And what about more advanced features, like HDR stacking (several different exposure times to enhance dynamic range) or drizzle? I imagine this could be difficult to implement, but [this](https://github.com/spacetelescope/drizzle) library might be of interest. I would love to use this once it's ready.
i guess tkinter, but not shure. 
good bot!
How hard was it to learn OpenCV? I am considering using it for one of my own projects.
Great job &amp; cool project, congrats!
Do it with curses?
Good points, thank you &gt;Is it a problem if there's many CLI frameworks developed? No, not any more than it is a problem if there's multiple web frameworks, or UI frameworks, or datetime libraries, or whatever. It's just code; ideas used for iteration. &gt;dotlock's *existence* isn't a problem, although if it gains steam it might well become one. But you don't get to just forbid people from iterating on existing concepts. Re CLI frameworks: it is a problem, I'd say, because the vast vast vast majority of them are *not* iterating on existing concepts. When every new person, failing to do their research, comes up with the exact same thing a million other people have already done better and *then* posts it on Reddit billing it as the New Thing, they're inevitably going to lure a few people in who might otherwise have been able to pick and/or help contribute to an already-maintained &amp; -in-use solution. The fragmentation this creates is really undesirable IMHO &gt;As to /u/CSI_Tech_Dept's experience, I'd say that any app where click / argparse have roughly the same amount of LOCs is probably not complex enough for Click. You can still use it for that if you prefer (or if you intend to make it more complex in the future), but there is *no world* in which it's as easy to build high quality verb-driven cli apps (like git, svn, etc) with argparse as it is with Click. I can't speak for libraries I haven't used, and I'm not saying click is *specifically* the best; it's just miles better [than argparse] and happens to have a solid community behind it. I'm with you here, 100% agreed

Thanks, so I'll wait for the SSD to arrive before installing linux right? Otherwise I'll have to install it again.
okay thank you
Typically just a lurker, and being a beginner, I typically don't comment. But, space.... anything space related is a big deal for me. I always wanted to do something relating to space with programming. This got me excited! Thanks.
You sure can, here's a small example I've done once (actually used it in P3_025). Using regex is probably the better option for a real application. (Using a settings file and writing/reading that is even better) https://github.com/SV-97/Py3-Private/blob/master/P3_026_SelfModifyingProgram/P3_026_SelfModifyingProgram.py
I tried print(str(name)) same thing. Also tried on pycharm. Still not working. 
read the sidebar post things like this in /r/learnpython read THAT sidebar what version of python are you using? Check that against the INPUT syntax you're using.
You could have it right the variables to a file and read from the file each time for the new variable set 
&gt; **GitHub Free** now includes unlimited private repositories R.I.P. my Bitbucket account &amp;#x200B;
That's what I would do. Install process will go much faster too. From there select default install and you are all set. 
I'm not sure how I feel about this. The value of github before was that it pushed people to publish code and get it out there. Now, I fear that people will hold back code "until they clean it up", which will of course be never. 
Yes you can. You can serialize data as a JSON file which is really easy. On another note, you should be asking this in r/learnpython
Thanks a lot! One more thing: is this ssd good enough?[https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/product/2FDzK8/kingston-a400-120gb-25-solid-state-drive-sa400s37120g](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/product/2FDzK8/kingston-a400-120gb-25-solid-state-drive-sa400s37120g)

Linux mint 18.3 has great support for old laptops. Spyder is a great IDE, but it really needs at least 1024 pixels wide to be useful.
More than enough!
Luckily my laptop has a 1366x768 resolution
This is so cool. Since when have you been learning/applying python? I'm a beginner and I want to start a project, so I'm kinda curious about when you started python. 
Use program called rufus
Oh or you can use pickle
Can i hide the selenium browser?
Bravo, what a super creative story, you should be pretty chuffed to scratch your own itch. In two days too. You're probably quite talented.
I used PyQt, I'm using KDE so I had Qt built in
I will still use bitbucket for Mercurial
Unless you are doing something very fancy I think the simplest way is to save the state in a file of some sort. Dumping some structure to json is one example.
Sorry yes! Copied and pasted my instructions from somewhere else I'd posted them but I guess I'd missed a step - my bad.
Not mint, but using wubi you can install Ubuntu without the need for a USB
Thanks, I'm glad you like my application! I'll probably release it, ,but I want to add way more functions (like reading from RAW/FITS formats, more stacking methods, stacking with pixel rejection etc)
That's a good idea. I'll make a new repository on my second GitHub account and then I'll post a link here
Thanks for the suggestion!
Cool! üòÅ
It was actually pretty easy, thanks to good documentation and numerous tutorials. You can just download OpenCV via pip and play with it, that way you'll learn the most
Thank you! üòä
How did you make the gui? 
I have never really "learned" Python, I began using it about a year ago: I read some tutorials covering Python's basics and started to make basic applications. This is always the best way to learn, by experimenting with the language and using it practically üòÄ
Thanks, I'm glad you like it üòÑ For GUI I used PyQt library 
Haha, thank you! üòÅ
I always like to mix my hobbies and do something like this üòÜ
I'll surely implement reading from RAW/FITS and writing to FITS. Maybe I'll add drizzle, thanks for the library! And why not implement HDR stacking? It'd be much harder than existing average stacking but maybe it'd be useful 
Using PyQt library :) 
Amazing! 
That would be awesome! But QtWebEngine doesn‚Äôt work on Raspbian. Its not supported on that version of linux for some reason. Otherwise id love to use that! Is there a workaround?
It has been discussed numerous times already. Use the search bar to find what have been said. 
Would also recommend a Lisp. Little Schemer is a great book to learn recursion from.
&gt; Throughout 1.X and 2.X * Python 2.6: string exceptions no longer supported, `Exception.message` deprecated, couple dozen standard library modules deprecated, `gopherlib` removed, `rgbimg` module removed. * Python 2.5: enforcement via `SyntaxError` of module source code being ASCII or using an encoding comment, multiple backwards-incompatible changes to the `os` module, backwards-incompatible change to `pickle`, the `regex`, `regsub`, `statcache`, `tzparse`, `whrandom` modules were removed, `lib-old` and its modules removed. * Python 2.4: `None` is a constant and cannot be rebound, `rfc822` module deprecated, `sys.exitfunc` deprecated, `tarfile` switched to GNU `tar` format, `mpz`, `rotor`, and `xreadlines` modules removed. * Python 2.3: `yield` becomes a keyword, `True` and `False` become constants, the `__debug__` flag no longer switches off `assert`, method resolution order of new-style classes changed, string representations of built-in extension types' classes changed, behavior of `in` operator changed for strings, `rexec` and `Bastion` modules removed. And that's five minutes' worth of reading release notes. I'm sure I missed stuff.
An interesting conversation for sure, but does it have much to do with Python? Also, has anyone in the developer community not already heard this today?
It's a mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands. For example if you want to calculate 3+2, you have to write 3 2 + to get the result. In this calculator you would have to introduce "3" "ENTER" "2" "ENTER" and "+".
Yes, and in 3.0-3.7 there's far more breaks in backwards compatibility than both the minor version bumps of 1 and 2 did combined. Especially in regard to asynchronous stuff core syntactical changes.
I took a look at your Jekyll script and it seems like you might want to take a look at using [literal string interpolation](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/), aka ‚Äúf-strings‚Äù, depending on which version of Python 3 you‚Äôre currently using.

Cool. Thanks. I‚Äôll take a look at that. I know there are several different ways to print strings in Python. 
true. I'm a lazy CS student, not a professional sysadmin or anything. I suspect I will look back at this project in a few years and laugh at myself
I might be uneducated, but your solution only works on Linux, right? My script gives me the advantage of not having to provide the full path to my python scripts that I'm using all the time.
Amazing stuff! Perfect use of your skills. Can't wait to see your updates and improvements. 
As far as I remember, async was with the caveat that it was preliminary and could be expected to change.
Python is for everything, it's a great starter language as it will introduce you to the core concepts of programming
Install an SSD. Best bang for the buck for spicing up an old laptop. 
Learn a more challenging language first. Java and C++ definitely qualify. Python abstracts out the data structures and algorithms that are the foundations of computer science.
Correct, but I mainly mean issues with naming conventions and the sudden disallowing of the term "async" as an identifier, whereas in 2.X such changes had a future statement in order to solve such issues.

Honestly, look at lots of stuff like C etc. to learn about Data types and basic control structures, do a bit of asm to get to know the deep downs and then learn python. It's a great language (my favorite) and you can do EVERYTHING with it (recently saw a fucking driver written in Python, it may not make sense but it's possible)
Oh and why Python: Platform independence, easy to learn more advanced topics like parallel programming etc with, you can focus on your logic, you can do everything you want with it, the code is quick to write, the code is beautiful, the Community is great
This one: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IuqL-4UftA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IuqL-4UftA) Its a waveshare 7.5 inch epaper. You can buy a driver board for it with a direct socket/pinout to mate with a RPI board. The driver board is separate to the display but you can find smaller epaper displays with the board affixed directly to the back (makes things simpler). It can do 2 colors, so you can have black + red (+ white). The power usage is extremely low if you put it in deep sleep (it only consumes power when updating the display). I've seen people connect it to small batteries and have it download from an API and refresh once every 30 minutes and have the battery last 90 days. This video by Applied Science is really great to watch: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsbiO8EAsGw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsbiO8EAsGw) He successfully overclocks the display but also provides a very great and understandable explanation of how the epaper displays work (and how the newer 2 color displays work). The downside is that this exact epaper display is very slow to update (10+ seconds I think). I think the slow update speed is because it has red while most epaper displays only do black and white. The other downside is that I think this one doesn't support any form of greyscale which can be a limitation depending on your application. Keep in mind if buying one you should find one which is designed for a raspberry pi or similar and includes a driver board. Without the driver board, my understanding is you have to make your own driver board and source circuits. I'm using an RPI 3 which is quite over the top for this as you can get smaller/cheaper boards to do the same thing just as well. For buying these you should be able to find them on Amazon: [https://www.amazon.com/Waveshare-4-3inch-Resolution-Interface-Electronic/dp/B00VV5IMN0](https://www.amazon.com/Waveshare-4-3inch-Resolution-Interface-Electronic/dp/B00VV5IMN0) (this isn't the exact one but same brand). If not Amazon, AliExpress has many stores which sell epaper displays and a lot of hobby electronic/IoT online stores also have them. I'm hoping to put mine in a picture frame and have it read out system/network specs on the fly.
It's crazy that in some other popular languages, who will go unnamed, the exact opposite is the general rule.

What is the URL was .html instead of .json at the end? would it still be enough to do .json()?
You need one specific class from this package? Nah, let's pull EVERYTHING into the namespace.
In general I feel Packt books are not the best ones out there. I think there's free resources that are more useful than these books.

&gt;Using a common set of idioms makes it easier That's why in Python, we try to be ***Pythonic***.
Agree. I've been using Rust; it's common there to include a prelude module; this is like a blanket import in that it's not obvious what it imports from reading the code, but its contents is specified by the package creator. I prefer Python's standards of make imports explicit.
Python. &amp;#x200B; Simples.
Sure!
So the main problem is when I try to learn Java or C++ the algorithms and the language itself are mixing my mind and at the end I wont understand anything. Some people say that I should start with the most difficult languages, some people say that I should understand the algorithms and the possibilities to turn stuff around with python and than go for more difficult ones, but im affraid that ill learn python and everything else will feel like rocket science for me although it feels like that right now.
This is the only programming subreddit I subscribe to so it's news to me.
What logic are you basing that on?
Well the main limitation (which *is* mentioned in the github blog) is that private repos can only have 3 contributors. So the lack of protected branches isn't really a big deal.
Thanks! Good to know - Rust is a very interesting language.
They made something free that wasn't free before, how're they gonna keep making money off of it otherwise? Next time also remind me to add a `/s`, geez.
Nah, Python allows you to grasp lots of stuff without having to worry about stacks, heaps, dangling pointers etc.. So you can really focus on getting the algorithms down. Also the interactive terminal allows you to easily Test stuff and play around with it. It'll also make sure you understand OOP which is a very important concept across most languages. If you're a bit farther into Python you can look into the Compiler/Interpreter and have something that's assemblerish to prepare for lower level languages.
I bought it and for the price its okay. Alot of example und content to get into or to cross read. Ofcourse nothing close like oreilly books. But there is one bad thing. One of the video toturials is incomplete and missing like 5 or 6 chapters. Support of humble bundle still didnt reacted to my ticket about the missing content.

Makes sense. They surely weren't selling many paid accounts on the basis of that feature alone, especially when Bitbucket offers it for free.
Yeah, render them in a text-form is probably what I mean. I want the key values to be rendered in a way so I can change date, time etc. { * **id**: "509925", * **startdate**: "2019-01-22", * **starttime**: "13:00", * **enddate**: "2019-01-22", * **endtime**: "14:30", * **description**: \[ * "37032-V19.k, 37470-V19.k, 40, E244, FKSYG 1, Lektion, Zoom, svantee" * \] * }, &amp;#x200B; This is how I want the key : values to be rendered in HTML. The calendar I am exporting this to will have the exact same layout/headers. 
Thank you very much Microsoft and Bill gates
Thanks!
Ah ok, so I found out that F# has static typing. I suggest you take a look at this page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#STATIC to understand why you ask is completely flawed by the fact that the two languages have different philosophies when it comes to typing. In F#, type is with the container. In python. type is with the contained.
What's the difference between light frames, dark frames, and flat frames?
It looks like to me that this function is coming from an uglified/minified JS. Practically it's impossible (read: quite hard) to figure out what exactly the function would do (btw, does TEA stand for some encryption library?) I would probably try to listen to `window.location.href` change or `window.open()`, since this is how the page would offer you the download in your browser.
I'm a strong believer that premature optimization is the root of all evil. I'd go with the text file, you can query it by just doing a for loop on the lines in the file and checking a condition.
Yup. \`json()\` is a just a method on \`requests.Response\` , and it'll sniff the content to see if it's json, regardless of the content-type even. &amp;#x200B; Another useful bit of this is that you can pass arbitrary kwargs to \`response.json\` and they'll all get passed in as args to \`json.loads()\`
Todo app is a good starting point, you'll learn a bit of everything! 
That's a good question! Light frames are just images of the object, the rest are called "calibration frames". Calibration frames are optional, but most often they improve quality of stacked image. There are three types of calibration frames: * Dark frames - they have the same exposure times as light frames, but they're taken with lens cap on. They capture noise from heat, dead pixels, dark current and fixed-pattern noise. They're subtracted from lights * Bias frames - they are taken with shortest possible exposure time, with lens cap on, these capture electronic noise - a noise caused by electronics on the sensor. They're subtracted from lights * Flat frames - you take these frames with something illuminating front of the telescope (for example a piece of paper illuminated with a flashlight). These frames are used to remove uneven field illumination from the image (eg. vignetting) and dust particles. They're, unlike dark or bias frames, divided from light frames 
Some possible answers to your question: [Why Learn Python? Here Are 8 Data-Driven Reasons](https://dbader.org/blog/why-learn-python).
Awesome!!
Cool! I'm thinking of trying out something in deep learning. Would that be a good idea?? 
If I swap the "url2" to .html instead of .json then I get a "no json object could be decoded". Should I not be able to do this? since I parse it? The url I fetch is originally in .html format. Below is my current code. url2 = "https://cloud.timeedit.net/ltu/web/schedule1/ri.html" querystring2 = querystring = {"h":"t","sid":"3","p":"20181101.x%20,20200906.x","objects":"114410.28","ox":"0","types":"0","fe":"0"} payload2 = "" headers2 = { 'cache-control': "no-cache" } response2 = requests.request("GET", url2, data=payload2, headers=headers2, params=querystring2) json\_data = response2.json() for event in json\_data\['reservations'\]: print (event\['id'\], event\['starttime'\], event\['columns'\]) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Thanks a lot for your tips btw.

To you what would be the best choice for text? A raw memory mapped text file with one sample per line?
Yes, deep learning is a very desirable and rapidly growing field today, and Python is a perfect tool for this. There are countless applications you can make with machine learning, and it gets even better with computer vision. I suggest you to take a look at libraries like Tensorflow, Keras, OpenCV (this one is computer vision library) and you can watch these videos to better understand how do these neural networks work: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi It's so fascinating!
Thank you! üòÅ
That's awesome!
Your welcome! May I ask how much time did it take you to gain the knowledge needed to make a program like this? 
Just go for it! The sooner it‚Äôs open source, the sooner you can get contributions and other eyes on the code (possibly calling out any big gotchas before you‚Äôve coded yourself in a corner). It‚Äôs already more polished sounding than half the stuff on GH anyway. Good luck!
Oh sweet that's what I'm using too. So yeah I'd be interested in seeing how you did it. 
Well, I'm not entirely sure, but I started using Python about a year ago and I started working with images (not in Python and not using OpenCV, but in Java with its inbuilt functions) about a month or two ago. But I never made a star alignment algorithm so I'm very satisfied with this üòÄ
I'll create a repository on my second GitHub account today and post it here

TL;DW: 18-minute talk on how to use the `json` module's basic functions. 
Pragmatic. 
Wow. Do you mind sharing the script? Or could you update on github? 
That is, in my opinion, precisely why you should start by learning Python.
Definitely start with Python. Programming will give you more pleasure, sooner, and you will be then at ease, when you feel ready for it, to go for a more complex language.
Have a look at the `gspread` package : [https://gspread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://gspread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
I have covered a lot of things.... 1) Serialization and DeSerialization of Json. 2) Importing json data from quandl in raw format. 3) Difference between json.load() and json.loads() 4) Making a GET request to quandl API to get json data 5) Difference between json.dump() and json.dumps() 6) Relevant parameters like separators So yes... It's a bit long, but I believe it covers a lot of the relevant basics.
Besides the day job, working on a little side thing for generating pixel art from images. It works okay now but I'm not totally happy yet. Need to learn more about image processing and filters and such, so far I've just been winging it.
Just a quick word of wisdom: classes are great, but functions are *totally fine*. A lot of people learn about OOP and they think everything needs to be a class. This isn't Java. Modules are to Python as Classes are to Java. I'm not saying don't use classes but keep them simple and they should represent a "thing" that you can explain.
Django is great. It's very easy to learn, but is flexible enough that you can do whatever you want once you learn. Down the road, check out Django REST framework too. Being able to write APIs is very useful, especially with how modern apps are being built.
Pithy.
I liked the read up but I would assume most of the community would be aware of the technologies and their draw backs. For those who are just perusing, I found honcho to be quite interesting. Basically like a .ini file for something like uwsgi but allows you to start multiple processes from one file, which is really cool. And for those who aren't familiar with vagrant using this command **config.vm.synced\_folder "data", "/data1"** allows you to mount, the data directory at /data1 mount point on the vagrant box. Also just felt his explanation on docker compose was lacking or rather his example but enough to get the point across. [https://honcho.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using\_procfiles.html#syntax](https://honcho.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_procfiles.html#syntax) Good read, even if its just to revisit these technologies, but creating a CI/CD pipeline early stages of development really pays off in the long run. Getting your code to run in a repeatable process from the beginning is of great importance.
Collaborative coding would be nice! Think about the potential for open-source projects (311k coders in r/Python)!
 I didn't know about the fibo package. Not that I will ever use it...
This sounds interesting, actually. Which OS?
Well, Python is very nice to start with No need for a compiler, dynamic typing, dict data structure everywhere,... and many other thing that make it very easy to get started and get things done! To someone who wants to gain a first experience in programming, I would definitely recommend Python. Only then, if you happen to like it and want to be more serious about it, then I guess the golden road is to learn C/C++ and its data structures and memory management. And then, you should be able to grasp quickly any language that would suit your need.
That's true, I'd love to contribute to the code in any form I can. Great work there OP!
Why not releasing it as open-source? 
I am the same way! This is damn cool! Kudos OP!
I don't get it. Can't you execute Python scripts already in PS?

I second the recommendation to just using javascript. I personally love Python and HATE javascript with a passion (it's literally worse than at least a dozen other languages for every single thing it's used for... it's never, ever, the correct choice anywhere). That said, Google Sheets uses javascript natively, and I have all my automations in Google sheets/docs/gmail done in javascript because it's just easier.
nbconvert can convert notebooks to markdown, pdf, latex, (...) which can be read by pandoc and converted to various formats, including word. Pandoc gets the content across, but may garble the formatting. I recommend going through markdown or latex. Btw: &gt; Word There is your problem. I had the fortune to be forced to learn latex as part of an entry level university course and in hindsight it is much more usable/useful than word.

So, I was mainly paying for a GitHub subscription before because I had a couple open-source projects there and it seemed logical to include my few private projects in the same account -- the price of $7/mo wasn't crazy expensive either. Now, what's the purpose of continuing to pay? It says that I get "advanced code review tools" in the Pro package, but I can't find any documentation on what that entails.

Beautiful! Good job!
How/where would I do that? This literally the first non "Hello World" or Project Euler script I have written.
&gt; Agree. I've been using Rust; it's common there to include a prelude module; this is like a blanket import in that it's not obvious what it imports from reading the code, but its contents are specified by the package creator. I prefer Python's standards of avoiding anon imports. In Rust the symbols just wouldn't be public in the first place. The `_` prefix in Python is just a less-enforced mean of visibility specification. Rust's preludes are more like defining an `__all__` module-attribute, it's an option for more specifically crafting the defaults-exports (what gets star-imported) somewhat orthogonal to the basic visibility thing.
When you say average - you mean median right? ;)
I'm fine with that. We all should be open to never stop learning.
It even happens with languages you'd think would know better e.g. `import Foo` in Haskell will do an unqualified (*and* qualified) import. Worse, `import Foo as Bar` *will also do an unqualified import* as well as a qualified import under `Bar`. At least you can opt out of unqualified imports (`import qualified Foo`), but still‚Ä¶ 
Sounds amazing :D any chance that you'll share your test images so I can play around with it? :D
That's a tough problem. The real answer is to correct this at the data architecture level - either by enforcing consistent column names across databases (tough) or, better yet, designing your data ecosystem such that there is only one canonical source of truth for each piece of data, and a set of uuids that can be used to join across sources. I'm going to assume that you don't have the access to address this at the architecture level, so you need an application level solution. One possibility - store a mapping (perhaps a yaml file) that defines a canonical field name that your app will use internally and the set of possible field names from your various sources. Each time you run a users query, use this mapping to translate from the cannonical field name to the data source specific field name. This is cludgy and would add a bunch of complexity to your project, so I would really recommend looking into an architectural solution if possible.
There is no such built-in package. I assume it's one created for this article or book...
Right on. I also do C++ and the amount of code that I see that does `using std;` at the top of each file just boggles my mind. (For those of you who don't know C++, that means import every single symbol in the massive standard library into the main namespace... thousands of symbols...)

Visual Regression Tool using Selenium and Reg-cli
Did you check the [CloudFlare 403 documentation](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200169226-Why-am-I-getting-a-403-error-)? Check the output from your request. If it's CloudFlare issuing the http 403, then it's for a very good reason: the owner of the website doesn't want scraping or other abnormal behaviour done on their site. It's likely caused by their browser integrity check, or any of their other checks. Like you said, you probably don't have a required cookie or something similar. Either try to have this available, or don't scrape this website, they probably don't want the added load of automated scraping anyway
If you're really having trouble, there's selenium, which allows you to automate an actual browser.
Yes I have. I don't thinks that the problem with block IP, as I tried to send request through several VM. Probably your're right about browser integrity check. But I want to know if the problem is only with cookies. I figured out the way how to get them programmatically, but still no luck 
I thought selenium is mostly used for performing js code. I give a try. Any tips/recommendations?
Thanks! I used OpenCV (for operations on images), Skimage (only for conversion from x-bit images to 16-bit images, I need to find a way to do this using OpenCV), PyQt (GUI framework) and some other minor libraries 
there's a python api for selenium 
Yes, PyQt5. I had this library built-in to my system (Manjaro KDE) so I thought that I could use it

It was likely not the intention of the post to show the optimal way of publishing a plot, but plotly dash does absolutely fantastic job in creating plots as a webpage from the dataframes and those are even interactive.

My mouse doesn't have a middle mouse button (it's a weird trackball). I needed one for using CAD software. To fix this, I made a program that allows a keyboard key to act as the middle button instead. https://github.com/jagprog5/SubstituteMiddleMouseButton
Well, no - by average I mean mean, not median. Median is the middle value from a list of numbers and mean is the average value. I used average stacking because (in my opinion) it removes noise better than median, though median stacking removes more outliers. To solve this, I'll implement average stacking with pixel rejection algorithm (like kappa-sigma clipping)

Interesting. Good luck with the project! Astrometry.net uses a triangulation method that sounds like what you went with - have you used that site before?
&gt; your solution only works on Linux, right? Nah. I have Bash and various Unix utilities installed on my Windows machine (installed with Git). If you `chmod` the file to be executable, and you have a shebang line, then bash will automatically run the correct interpreter. What's cool about this is that you don't even need to be running Bash; if I execute a script from Powershell, it still picks up the shebang. (I assume PS is calling Bash, and then Bash is figuring out the shebang.)

As a Python developer who has to use and debug large packages that do ‚Äòimport *‚Äô, please don‚Äôt do this. Filling the base namespace with literally tens of thousands of names with no organization may need to be tolerated in C in other languages, but Python has shown it doesn‚Äôt have to be that way. Supporting that code is a nightmare. And you don‚Äôt have to take my word for it. The entire package has grown more and more bloated over time as support people have found they can‚Äôt sort through the mass of names and just throw up their hands and add another (hopefully!) new name on the pile. What was a very powerful and helpful package in the beginning is being completely scrapped and re-written because new and existing users refuse to use it anymore.

Have a project for doing some stuff on a Raspberry Pi over HTTP and recently updated the "Move" plugin, which is used to - you guessed it - move and click the mouse. Not actually doing anything with the Pi right now so the updates are rather sporadic but got the inspiration the other day. Previously it was just directional HTML-buttons to move the mouse in different directions (or jump to the center of the screen), with an input for pixels per press. And, of course, buttons for Left-, Right-, Middle- and Double Left-clicks. A big flaw, I realised, was that you had to be in front of the screen to see what you were doing. So added a screenshot on the HTML page which updates after each action. Then realised that with some calculations on the relative placement of the image, and JavaScript click-events, I could just send requests to move the mouse directly to wherever you click the image. [This is how it currently looks.](https://i.imgur.com/0Qwk91d.png) -------- What's currently on the Pi-screen is another project which lists coming bus-departures through requests to the local bus company API - so if someone is visiting and about to look up departures online I can just say "turn on the TV and switch to channel this-and-that" and there it is. That's a separate project, which is a Meepenstein's Monster combo of Bash, Python and Java with Spring Boot for the different bits.

def he should learn some database tech, is really handy and so integral to a good web app/ website etc..
Thanks for your feedback. I do after with the first part, I am keeping track of counters like non_swaps which is not even being used. Second and third argument, I don't agree. I will explain why. Regarding the second feedback you mention that it iterates over already sorted elements and that it lacks the knowledge of algorithms. Go ahead and check out the algorithm for Bubble Sort ( even I have explained the algorithm before the code). The algorithm checks every pair of numbers in the sequence and decides whether to swap or not to swap. Only when the sequence is completely sorted, the algorithm stops. That Jeanne it has to go through every pair, irrespective of whether it is sorted it not sorted. I was trying to show the exact way in which algorithm works. I wasn't looking out to solve such edge cases. Anyway, I also mention that it is one of the most inefficient algorithms. Infact I believe that even though I knew about it's limitation, I chose to imminent it exactly the way the algorithm dictates. That in the contrary shows my knowledge of the algorithm. I mean think about it, why write so many lines of code, when you can just use sorted method in Python and be done with it. Your second feedback (as far as I understood) is about not documenting to show whether the list needs to be changed or a new list needs to be returned. The thing is, that I why I went for a function. If I say, x = some_list and I pass it into the function as an argument, irrespective of whether I return a new list or modify the argument that I received, I am never going to change the value of x. O don't know whether it is okay for a junior position or a senior position. But what's important is, the recruiter knows that the person can write code. No one in this world has made an application at their first attempt. So during an interview, expecting a candidate to produce the best possible result would be totally bizarre honestly.
Have not seen that tutorial before. And to correct myself I must say I have very small experience with flask\* So far I can get the output in text-forms just like I wanted when I use a hard-coded URL in my python. Next thing is to create a button which users can use to insert URL's that produces the output as it is now. 
thanks a lot. Could you share any cool scripts that may be useful to me? :D 
Iirc, cfscrape uses nose underlying. Do you have it installed

I think sentdex on YouTube has incredible tutorial videos using python. If I‚Äôm trying something new, I usually look on his page first for a starting point to walk me through using different packages. His video on pandas is: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjy9UqKKuo Is this the kind of thing you were looking for??

Post your slow ass code and we can help you make it faster. 
I moved to gitlab because it is a complete package. I get pipelines, build everything ship to private docker repository that gitlab provides for $0. If I wanted to do that on github even with these changes I would have to pay for each tool separately (because tools are free for private repos only), those things add up. Also it makes more sense to have all the tools unified.
&gt; Go ahead and check out the algorithm for Bubble Sort ( even I have explained the algorithm before the code). Each pass of a bubble sort with determine with certainty one value at the end of the list (the last value will never change after the first pass, the second to last value will never change after the second pass, and so on). By changing the endpoint of the for loop each time you make it go faster. It's still O(N^(2)) but it is less by a factor of 2. That said, in an interview situation, I've only seen bubble sort used up on the whiteboard where the interviewee is to do something off the top of their head. When given a computer an an IDE, they'd probably use a canned sorting algorithm.
Link to today's version: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html
Well, not really. Sentdex is a great guy, I've watched his quantopian videos, but most of them are beginner level and he does not cover advanced topics. Let me give you an example: think of writing a factorial function or fib function in python: you can do it with recursion, loop, reduce, etc... all these methods will give you same results, but with different speed. Now think of using lru_cache decorator or any other caching technique. Will it improve the result? - no, but it will improve speed and memory usage greatly. And most probably, top speed method with cache will be different than top speed method without cache. This is the kind of details and tricks I am looking for pandas usage. 
EEK! Sorry! That's what happens when I google... https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html ... I hope that's better.
Nice thorough article. I really showcases that there's no single good solution to this problem. &gt; Your local operating system is not going to match with the operating system of your live website. This is listed as a disadvantage for local software development, but I feel this might also be an advantage. If your team has varying local setups, you are far less likely to depend on some idiosyncrasy of your setup. I've dealt with a project that wouldn't work if `nc` (netcat) was installed. They had never discovered this issue, because of their OS monoculture. They had always worked with containers, where nc is not typically installed. They had named one of their tools `nc`, but installed it in the path search order where it was behind the system `nc`. 
Gotcha. I definitely took your post differently. I‚Äôm used to starting with sentdex to give me an idea and that beginner level intro, then I go to source docs to see quirks on the package. Taking those into trial and error and troubleshooting to optimize for my application. Long, tedious, and full of head pounding... but I usually don‚Äôt know what else to do and it works haha. Sorry though for not helping 
Here comes the main trick: whenever I want to solve a certain task with python, I know that it will take me X min to do with R+data.table. Then I allocate X*4 min for python, and almost always I end up wasting this time on stackoverflow or googling how certain stuff is done with pandas. Then I fail to force python do everything 'in-memory' and the code ends up eating all available memory and never completes, so some other fkup that is due to poor knowledge of pandas. Neither data.table or pandas are intuitive, but somehow data.table vignettes and tutorials got me to a certain level where I'm pretty efficient with R, but I can not break this glass ceiling with python+pandas. This leads me to less practice with python and I keep falling back to doing stuff with R, because R 'lines of thought' do not translate to pandas directly. Thus I need an advice on an advanced pandas course, that covers all standard topics in great details, including memory management issues, etc..
For cross comparison: [http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html](http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html)
It ok. Learned R this way, do not want learning pandas via 'head banging'. As Raymond Hettinger says "there must be a better way!"
Personally I do &lt;appname&gt;YYYYMMDDHHMMSS Same would go for files as an example a csv file &lt;appname&gt;YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.csv This way the files and folders naturally sort and you know what they are and from when. If files get created faster, just use milliseconds.

Yep. Thanks
Oh i did not know this. I don't think any of my code uses import * because I can never remember what utility functions are where, but interesting none the less.

Looks like this mostly involves interacting with the OS file system. If you wish to do this with python, you will likely benefit from the [standard os library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html). You should find all the necessary commands for the interaction with the files. The additional logic shouldn't be too tricky. Of course you will need to deal with case sensitive aspects of the file naming conventions. But python is [pretty strong on string manipulations](https://www.linode.com/docs/development/python/string-manipulation-python-3/).
&gt; Next thing is to create a button which users can use to insert URL's that produces the output as it is now. You could do this two ways: create two forms on the same page, one for inputting the URL and another for output/edit of the results. Or you could have a single page to get the URL and then when they hit submit you can go to the page to output/edit results..
r/foundtherustuser
The problem I see is first name... Will, Bill, William, and various misspellings will all create new entries. Otherwise, it would be a pretty simple program. Most of it would be done with functions from the os module. `os.listdir()` every few minutes to find new files in the directory. `os.mkdir()` to create directories. You can either use raised exceptions for existing directories or use `os.path.exists()` to check if the directory exists before creating. Then, `shutil.move()` to move the scanned file.
This is actually hilarious.

Wow, thanks a lot! I just started reading and you seem to address the pain points very accurately, starting from indexing... this is really driving me nuts, especially with depreciated methods mentioned as 'go to' methods in books and manuals I noticed that your name matches the repo name, and I made a guess that this is your text, so thank you for talking your time to write and share it!

Does this mean the list comprehension is better?
how would I do this with an if? instead of jumping by 2
I tried all that but wasn't able to get it to work. I ended up letting chrome launch the download, then switching to the downloads page via selenium, and grabbing the link from an element in there. In case anyone needs this in the future: # Support function that expands shadow DOM elements. def expand_shadow_element(element): shadow_root = browser.execute_script('return arguments[0].shadowRoot', element) return shadow_root # Open downloads page in chrome to get file link. browser.get('chrome://downloads') # Navigate to the element with the link (Chrome hides things under shadow DOM so it's not as simple as using XPATH) root1 = browser.find_element_by_tag_name('downloads-manager') shadow_root1 = expand_shadow_element(root1) root2 = shadow_root1.find_element_by_id('mainContainer') root3 = root2.find_element_by_id('downloadsList') root4 = root3.find_element_by_tag_name('downloads-item') shadow_root4 = expand_shadow_element(root4) root5 = shadow_root4.find_element_by_id('content') root6 = root5.find_element_by_id('details') root7 = root6.find_element_by_id('title-area') root8 = root7.find_element_by_id('file-link') # Store the URL for further use. file_url = root8.get_attribute('href') Not the most efficient or pretty way to do things, but it gets the job done...
Very nice, I was thinking of starting a similar project in Python/OpenCV myself, but with the goal of automating satellite astrometry. Right now I do it by hand and the process is rather tedious. The first steps would be pretty much the same, aligning and stacking the frames, but with the additional preliminary step of passing each image through [Astrometry.net](https://Astrometry.net)'s software (I have a linux box I run it on locally). Once each image is aligned and astrometrically solved, I'd have the software look for differences between them, to find streaks corresponding to satellites transiting the field of view. Groups of neighboring pixels that are different between images and significantly above the background standard deviation would be highlighted so that the user can select it and have the program automatically catalog the coordinates in standard IOD format for processing by other existing satellite orbit determination programs like Elfind and SatFit. If you decide to make your github page public I might fork it and try to adapt it for that. 
I was interested to see what interfacing with the Telegram API looked like, but then I found: `import telegram` Classic Python

I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit: - [/r/datascience] [Jupyter and interactive data in VS Code!!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/adyv90/jupyter_and_interactive_data_in_vs_code/) &amp;nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
The left side is the code that produced the right side. Instead of a "cell box" you type "#%%" to begin a code cell and then you have the option to click "Run Cell | Run All Cells" or right click the screen and select more options. When you click run cell it starts a Juypter kernel and opens the side Python Interactive window.
They are totally useless services for older people. My parents also wants their granddaughters photos/videos as daily messages on WhatsApp.
Some of them. Also, sending a random photo every day makes it a bit more gamified. I actually find myself expecting the daily photo because I don't know which of the photos will appear
Very cool! I will check it out too.
/r/learnpython read the sidebar google something like "python iterate over words"
In my opinion, no. Most freelance stuff I see is web-based, so although you could technically get by with just python, you'll want to learn JS/TS plus HTML/CSS.

It depends on your abilities to go out and find clients.
There's at least one service (that I can't remember) that will automatically pull photos from your Facebook, turn them into postcards, and mail those to your relatives. Useful for those who can't handle the technology part at all.
Atom is pretty neat, thanks! Hydrogen in particular offers nice flexibility -- a hybrid interactive + scripting environment. Unfortunately the auto-complete is not as great as Jupyter Notebook's. It doesn't always pop up unless I "jiggle it" by typing and deleting a bunch. Also a lot of packages don't install and are hard to troubleshoot (bracket highlighting matcher and jupyter, for example). And it's not clear how to point Hydrogen to a specific Python installation, nor Atom for that matter. They just use whatever they first hit in the immediate path, and for some reason won't forget an old Python 2 I deleted.
Indeed
&gt; This application picks up a photo from a specified directory, sends it to a specified Telegram chat and then deletes that photo. daily_photo seems like a misnomer then. What's the process for picking a random photo each day? That seems like the more interesting part to me. Especially interested in questions like "What if you don't have any photos that day?" and "How do the photos get onto your computer?" and "If you import photos later than the day you take them, do they have a chance of getting sent?".
Fair enough! Yeah, looks like if there isn't json to be parsed, .json() will fail. Glad I could bring you a useful tip :D 
Post the code in R then post your version in python. Then we can help...otherwise I don't have some magic tutorial for you.
I haven't tried this myself but I found https://www.peopleperhour.com/
And this is why I love Python. Either there's a wrapper or there's Requests. Both make the job easy. 
Unfortunately (IMO), VS Code adds a new output cell every time you run a code "cell" (indicated by #%%) on the left, even if you are re-running a code cell. In other words, if you make 5 changes to a plot and re-run after each change to see what it looks like, you will end up with 5 cells on the right. You can manually delete the output cells on the right but I think I'd prefer it if the original output cell was overwritten each time instead.
Also, why does it delete the photo? If it didn't, I'd imagine pointing it at my photo library directory for the day, but if it's deleting shit then I need to create copies of the photos. And if I'm doing that, then I'm going to either do the random selection then and copy that one photo or copy all the options and have the script delete them all so there isn't a bunch of cruft leftover. No?
Good. But how would you automate my clone to visit my grandfather each week ? :( Btw very clean code, wp wp
just a guess, but the deletion might just be there to avoid sending duplicates.
The nicest telegram api for python is still [https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot)
The most difficult part would be getting started. People want to hire someone with a track record. So maybe if you have friends/co-workers who would give you your first couple jobs on freelancer.com or whatever. Other than that, I think you'll find it too hard to get traction.
What were you sending tts to the googlehome for?
I wish it could do this using a remote Jupyter instance (local VS Code + plugins -&gt; Remote Jupyer via web interface or whatever). That would be super useful for the platform I work on.
I don't know if this is possible but you can try to compare the scene. Like it starts and clicks, after a new monster appears (don't know the conditions) you make it compare the actual scene to the scene before, so you can gather a difference (new monster zone) and u'll have an area to click. 
Yes, split the sentence into a list of words by blank spaces, then use... for word in words: do something with each word
so, as always, there is likely a way to make this faster; but at 13 seconds, you need to decide what return on your dev-time-investment will be satisfactory. &amp;#x200B; the most obvious path, to me, is to split the file into chunks and use multiprocessing to analyze each chunk in parallel. as well, this line: \&gt; shortest\_region\[gene\_name\] = 10000000000000000, previous\_line, line &amp;#x200B; seems frivolous and you should be able to refactor your design to avoid this unnecessary overhead
Imagine giving the script mistakenly your nude photo directory.
The hardest part of this project would be to get my parents to switch from WhatsApp to Telegram.
It should just rename the photo with a prefix and avoid the prefixed photos. I could imagine that the point would be to take a bunch of great photos at any given time then slowly send them over the course of days. Automating the relationship somewhat, gosh it is the future isn't it?
I switched my whole family to Telegram over the holidays. Give it a shot!
No problem... A [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) is something like that interactive application you get when you simply run python.exe. So what I'm curious about is if I can also use a REPL to interact with the ipython kernel that runs the jupyter cells for vscode, the same way [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) does.
The best part about this is that you can source control the .py and it will still run fine, because the '#%%' is just treated as a comment. The biggest issue with jupyter notebooks right now, is that they are impossible to properly source control. 
You're totally right. Multi-OS could be an advantage. This is especially true if your team is designing a product that is meant that is meant to work on multiple platforms. Having teammates with heterogenous environments will definitely shake out platforms differences. Thanks for highlighting that!
How about the Twilio integration with WhatsApp? https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/whatsapp/api I haven't personally tried it, but it appears relevant.
As a background, I've used MATLAB quite a bit during my grad studies but when I joined the workforce as an engineer/data scientist, MATLAB was not legally available to me due to the ridiculously expensive license. I moved on to Octave and then Python and in 2017 made the leap to Julia; it wasn't much of a leap (given my MATLAB background). With all of this being said, here is my evaluation of Julia and machine learning at the moment: Julia is the language for people working on ill-defined machine learning problems. Python is for everyone else. If you're a hobbyist, I'd stay away from Julia for the time being. Python is more standard at the moment, with many more available packages. Julia simply doesn't have any must-have tools the Python doesn't have for most people and half the time you'll end up calling Python packages from Julia anyway. That being said, if you're someone like me (the kind of guy people go to when you've got something really weird), Julia is by far your best bet. It is much easier to hack and tweak existing packages, because they're usually written in Julia anyway. If you can't find a packages that does what you want, you can easily write it yourself and have it be fast. You can have an object-oriented project execute at the speed of Numba without using any weird tricks or language. You can vectorize or write a for loop; both are pretty much the same speed, just choose what looks better and is more readable. The other force that is in Julia's favour is MIT which is strongly backing Julia. Academics pay attention to what MIT is doing and from this standpoint, Julia has an unfair advantage. Researchers who are mathematicians not programmers, can now write fast algorithms that other researchers won't have a hard time reading, hacking or implementing. The distance between mathematicians/researchers and developers has been dramatically shortened (and many times are the very same people). 
Any thoughts on how to get parents to move to Telegram?
Can you try harder to remember? I built a thing that did this with Instagram, but then they changed their API to only return lower resolution photos so my thing doesn't work any more :)

To answer your question about pointing atom to a specific environment, all you need to do is activate that environment in command prompt / shell and run atom by typing in atom.

&gt; Your second feedback (as far as I understood) is about not documenting to show whether the list needs to be changed or a new list needs to be returned. The thing is, that I why I went for a function. If I say, x = some_list and I pass it into the function as an argument, irrespective of whether I return a new list or modify the argument that I received, I am never going to change the value of x. No, it's about side effects. Some functions actually change their input, and some will make a new copy and leave the old one unchanged. You might notice your bubblesort does the opposite of what `sorted()` does in the standard library? Accidentally mutating a list is a very common source of bugs. You might always write code in one way, but not everybody does, and others (especially in a professional environment) will use your code. I'd expect an experienced developer to either name that something like `sort_in_place` or provide a docstring indicating that it mutates its argument. Either would allow me, using an IDE, to know what it does without having to read the code. As I said, for an interview, it would (to me) show the candidate was inexperienced at interacting with the python community. it might be OK for a junior position, I guess, but it's highly likely that someone else has a better implementation because they've interacted with the open source community or been formally trained by a university.

Honestly, if I could just delete all traces of Python, I think my situation would be much easier. But I've heard I shouldn't really touch the Python my Mac comes with or it'll seriously ruin my OS(?). That's why I'm coming here :'( Unless that's not really what you meant and you know some nicer way to do this? I assume the troubleshooting would have to be very Mac specific...
The algorithm for counting syllables is only approximate, but notably brief. For which use cases to you find it acceptable? When I did one of these programs long, long ago, I took Flesch's book as the source of truth for how to calculate his readability score. He wrote that the number of syllables in a word depends on pronunciation and allowed that the same word may have multiple pronunciations that vary with regard to syllable count, thus giving the scorer or program a little latitude. I think that there were also a few other ambiguities to be resolved case-by-case, e.g. whether or not hyphenated words or terms should count as one word, how many syllables and words to count for acronyms, if a clause separated from a sentence by a semicolon dash or dashes should be counted as a separate sentence. I'll bet that your users really do not want to care about any of this.

Not sure why this is an issue for you in rust? If you import * you only get the members marked as public or exported. This is in fact better than python. Think of rust as being opt in to being part of * versus python where you opt out. That means you're getting way more junk in python. If your issue however is that preludes are a common design pattern, I'll grant that it can be an issue if you're using them a lot and have conflicts, but you're not required to use the *. You can import just what you want, exactly like in python.

If it's just for the photos, then install it for them, and show them how to view the daily photo. My wife and (adult) kids communicate exclusively with Telegram, but I decided it's not worth trying to get my parents to use it, because they don't know anyone else who has it. They're in their mid 70s and although still very active and competent in other areas of life, for some reason they seem to struggle with smartphones. It's not an exaggeration to say that more than 50% of the times that I call them, they manage to answer then immediately hang up (I usually hear one of them saying to the other, "He hung up before I could answer"!)
It really depends. C is inheriting from 2 different concrete classes (no reason for abstract classes to have an __init__), which is not generally recommended. The writer of C needs to know how the internals of A and B work and structure his class based on exactly what functionality is being delegated and what is being overridden. It depends on the specifics; C.__init__ might call A.__init__, B.__init__, both, or neither. What matters is that the object is compatible with the delegations to A and B by the time C.__init__ returns. 
For star arguments you could pass `*c` and `*g` into the C constructor as iterables, or you could pass one in as an iterable and keep the other as a star argument

So the reason why you can't do that is unittest never gets the string in the assert. The assert raises an exception if the assert fails and unittest catches the exception and builds the output you are refering too. There are some ways you could acomplish this but they involve extending the unittest.TestCase and probably extending the unittest result object. Not sure if you want to build out the reporting part of unittest. What may work better is the use of subTests that describe a very specific test case. For instance comparing json ```` for k, v in dic.items(): self.subTest(f"key {k} in dic2"): self.assertIn(k in dic2) self.subTest(f"value for {k}:{v} equal"): self.assertEqual(v, dic2.get(k)) ``` 
Thanks. There's like 5 different ways to do numbers with decimal points and god knows how many groups of people segment numbers differently (some people put a comma after every two from the right side, some from the right first at 2 then at every three). So I asked because I wanted to make sure.

While [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/30260285) is explicitly for python 2, and of course strings in python 3 are a bit different, the idea is still valid. A string in python is a python object, not something like a char array as you'd see in C. You don't have a pointer to an array of bytes, you have a python object that, among other pieces of information, the string itself. Again, the source mentioned in the answer isn't python 3 so the implementation could look different for python 3's unicode strings, but the core idea is there
Ok? Want a cookie? I think your browser make this for free with just 5 characters
I personally think it‚Äôs the best im that exists. It also has voice calls and their voice codec is amazing. 
You have three misconceptions here. First is this: &gt; Unicode uses 1 byte to represent english alphabet and 2 bytes in order to present a symbol from non-latin alphabet This is wrong. Unicode characters are *abstract code points* between 0 and 0x10FFFF (in hex). How are those abstract code points represented in memory? That depends, but the short answer in they can take between 1 and 4 bytes, depending on the encoding method you use and the character. (More detail below.) The second misconception you apparently have is that strings in Python are low-level arrays of characters; they aren't, they are *objects* with all the overhead that entails. **So the short answer to your question** is that the rest of the bytes are object overhead, such as a pointer back to the class object, the length of the string, and other book-keeping fields. They're subject to change, since they are purely implementation details. Your third misconception is that Python strings store their address. They don't. No Python object stores its address. Nor does the `id()` function return an address (except by accident). The `id()` function is documented as returning an *abstract ID number*, and in fact Jython and IronPython uses sequential numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, ... as IDs. Regarding the storage of Unicode abstract code points in memory, the Unicode standard allows any implementation you like, but it does define a few standard implementations that nearly everyone uses. - UTF-32 represents every code point ("character") with exactly *four bytes* regardless of the character; so the letter "A" could be stored in memory as 0x00000041 or 0x41000000 (big endian or little endian). - UTF-16 represents every code point as either *two bytes* or *four bytes*. Those code points requiring four bytes are sometimes said to belong to "the astral plane", and some programming languages like Javascript do not support them. (Python does,) Using UTF-16, the letter "A" will be 0x0041 or 0x4100 depending on whether you have a big endian or little endian system; the astral character "U+10107 AEGEAN NUMBER ONE" would be 0xD800DD07 (big endian) or 0x00D807DD (little endian). - UTF-8 is always big-endian, and it represents code points with a variable number of bytes, between 1 and 4 bytes. Unlike the others, UTF-8 is backwards-compatible with ASCII: "A" will be 0x41 (like ASCII) and the AEGEAN NUMBER ONE will be 0xF0908487. - UTF-7 encodes Unicode characters in a 7-bit clean format, for systems that assume bytes always have the most significant bit cleared. Nobody uses UTF-7 except for specialist uses, but all of the others (UTF-8. UTF-16 and UTF-32) are quite common. In Python 3, starting with version 3.3, Unicode strings are stored in a space-savig format: if the largest code point in the string is no greater than U+FF (which includes the full ASCII range), it is stored using a single byte per character (effectively Latin-1); if the largest code point is no greater than U+FFFF, it uses two bytes per character (effectively UTF-16); otherwise it uses UTF-32 (four bytes per character). So the memory usage of a four-character string can change depending on the range of characters in that string: py&gt; sys.getsizeof('AAAA') 29 py&gt; sys.getsizeof('AAAœÄ') 46 py&gt; sys.getsizeof('AAA\U00010107') # AEGEAN NUMBER ONE 56 
Normally-distributed with a mean of zero, of course.
Thank you. Let assume that C\_\_init\_\_ is calling both A.\_\_init\_\_ and B.\_\_init\_\_. And C needs all the possible arguments A and B might need to be initialized. Sorry for my ignorance, would you tell me how can I pass \*c as iterator? (as because I can only pass a single star argument into a function)

Why use UTF-8? Apart from MicroPython, no Python interpreter that I am aware of uses UTF-8 internally for strings. CPython certainly doesn't, it uses the [Flexible String Respresentation](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0393/). I believe that both Jython and IronPython use the underlying JVM or CLR string representation internally, which I *think* is UTF-16, but I could be wrong about that. But whatever they use, I'm pretty sure they aren't UTF-8.
I'm not exactly looking for a replacement (because supposedly I'll be taken care of), but how does it compare to Hangouts?
If you're running your unit tests using the standard command line interface, pass the `-v` command line option for verbose output: python -m unittest -v path/to/test_suite.py This will print the results of successful tests as well as unsuccessful ones. (This is [documented](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#command-line-interface), but not well, so I'm not surprised that you missed it.) If you're running your tests another way, you'll have to tell us how you run them before we can answer.

Can you elaborate? I agree that Jupyter is terrible for GitHub, there are ways to automatically strip output upon git diff and git commit but they are hacky
What VSC is doing is reading the .py file looking for ‚Äú#%%‚Äù. Every time it sees it, it considers everything below it up to the next #%% as one cell. This cell is sent to the notebook server and the output is shown on the right. This means that you can completely source control the .py file because it‚Äôs just text. You can‚Äôt do the same thing with ipynb without some hacky work arounds.

&gt;it‚Äôs Russian It's not. It's created by a founder of VK (the main Russian social network) Pavel Durov who was ousted from his position due to refusing to providing personal details on some people to the government and was replaced by pro-Kremlin people. He emigrated from Russia after that and created Telegram in emigration. Telegram is currently banned in Russia because they refuse to provide the encryption keys to the government.

Email is federated. Everyone has it. Therefore Telegram can't be better. I hope someone builds a federated protocol for something like Telegram or Signal.

In Java it is very uncommon to do static imports. Usually, Java code imports the whole package, the difference being that in Java, more often than not, package means just one class, so it's not that bad. One thing that wasn't mentioned about the asterisk import in Python is that it screws up parsing, which is already very bad in Python. If your translation module doens't define all symbols, then you cannot make sure that your syntax is correct before you parse imported modules. This prevents parsing in parallel and makes circular imports very complicated.
This is great! Definitely useful for helping the family stay connected :) &amp;#x200B;
Cool! Thanks for sharing.
&gt; easy to learn more advanced topics like parallel programming etc Is this a joke? You cannot really do parallel programming in Python. Is this what makes it easy to learn?
Yuck
ipynb are just text too. Why doesn't that work there? 
What a bunch of nonsense... Java is a simpler language than Python in many obvious ways: 1. More uniform syntax. 2. Fewer syntactic constructs (although they are catching up...) 3. Java is a lot more predictable and comes with a bunch of tools that make sure that novice programmers don't screw up the basic stuff. Java is not a good first language because it doesn't build from first principles and is very biased towards one particular aspect of modern programming. But so is Python. So, if anything it's a tie: neither language is really any good to be the first programming language you learn, unless you already landed a job, where you need to program, and you need to program it in language X.
It‚Äôs JSON. People who you share it with need to have a notebook server. With this I can share just the .py file and it will run like a normal python script. 
Yes, unicode characters are not low level character arrays. They are objects.
Naturally I've missed this! Thanks a lot. This opens up options :)
The frustrating part is that it is almost too simple :D
I think getting over the habit of mixing I/O with business logic is the most significant improvement I ever made, and I know how it got there to begin with- you write a shell script to curl something, then you do something with the output, and then you use curl again to send the data somewhere... You keep digging that hole and then bring all the bad habits to python. I saw a presentation by Brandon Rhodes on the clean architecture for Python, and another by Per Fagrell on writing object oriented python and it was basically life changing. Highly recommend those talks, they are available on YouTube. 
Thinking regular expressions were self-documenting enough that I didn't need to know about or use the **re.VERBOSE** flag. Using **print** instead of **logging**. Using **os** module process launching instead of **subprocess**. Inheritance -- especially multiple inheritance -- instead of composition. Concatenation instead of **str.format**. Ever using **reload**.
Why don't you iterate on that a bit further? Is the GIL what you're after? If so: the same concepts still apply even if you don't gain performance from it. Also you can use `multiprocessing` to get around the GIL. And of course you could always use PyPy, Jython or IronPython to use the parallel programming features of .NET/CLI or the JRE
You should say. values does not live long enough, but I don't see any borrow problem here. The issue on your yeah macro, and, debugging macro, from its nayure, is worst than the borrow checker :)

Superb man solution!
I think it says composition is preferred instead of inheritance, since the question is "what habits you wish you had unlearned?"
I prefer composition over inheritance; it makes reasoning about your code _much_ easier. In general over time I've been slowly learning that OOP is a good idea in theory and a bad one in practice, and that inheritance is the primary reason for that.

I think they're saying they used to use inheritance but now prefer composition. Composition makes it easier to do things like add small bits of functionality, like if you want to lock editing of a subset of asset types, by just making a `Lockable` class that has some basic attributes (maybe `is_locked`, `locking_user`, and `last_locked_date` or something) and having the asset types you want to be lockable inherit from this small class. Inheritance is okely dokely if you have a truly unique subset of a thing (eg. all `Battery` instances can `charge`, but `MobileBattery` instances can do everything batteries can, and also`move`) in which case you just need to implement `move`, and everything else can otherwise act as if your mobile batteries are just batteries.

Nope Sagemaker is perfectly fine, this is just another way around to install on a dedicated server and work upon. 
This was a very special week for me, I always wanted to make awesome **web app** using python but every time I tried, the *frontend sucked*. So I started learning about HTML and CSS a to create web app template. I took [\#100daysofcodechallenge](http://100daysofcode.com/) on January 1, and practiced HTML and CSS at **freeCodeCamp** every day. Created a **UI element** \- two [*Email Subscription* \[1\]](https://codepen.io/therohitdas/pen/jXZJYo) \[[2](https://codepen.io/therohitdas/pen/zyWRBJ)\] Form Using what I learned at freeCodeCamp. will soon start Creating the project. In this week I wrote a lot of Python code too, I made a very simple [Twitter Bot](https://github.com/therohitdas/twitterbot) that follows and unfollows user, retweets user content. and I am currently working on creating a video doc explaining how it works and how you can make one. &amp;#x200B; *Thanks for giving me an opportunity to write it all down.*
My first web application based on a Python back-end. It's a simple mathematical game which currently asks you how many numbers are contained within certain intervals (based on difficulties). &amp;#x200B; Tech stack used: 1. Backend 1. `Python`, with `web.py` `framework` (light but powerful web framework created by Aaron Schwarz , first version of *reddit* was built with it) 2. Frontend 1. Vanilla `HTML/CSS/JavaScript` (no wrappers, frameworks, preprocessors and other bloatware etc.) &amp;#x200B; Current state: \- Almost ready for going live with it (I just need to document myself about what are the *minimum legal requirements* necessary in order to absolutely stay out of trouble, such as: **cookie policy, privacy policy, terms of use, etc.** But since the application is in it's most basic form (doesn't even have a login system and doesn't store any client data in the db or on the client machine besides **cookies** I think all I need for now is a **cookie policy** and some basic **terms of use**) \- After I'll add the minimum legal requirements, I'll do a code freeze, tag the repo, buy a domain &amp; hosting and deploy it. &amp;#x200B; Further plans with it: \- Make it more complex: add modals with tips on how to solve problems and improve your math, add a login system, analytics, etc. \- Make a dynamic system to add an unlimited number of games, each of them being a card in front-end which you can choose and play (games don't necessarily need to be math related but mostly I'll focus on math because it might benefit somebody) &amp;#x200B; If anybody wants to give it a look, any feedback is welcome (good or bad): [Github repository](https://github.com/mariusmucenicu/mind-games) &amp;#x200B; Hope y'all have a productive week! Cheers! &amp;#x200B;
They have, it's called XMPP.
1. /r/learnpython 2. You can't access digits of an int like that.
Yep, this is what the OP is using
As the other felow redditor said, I believe that tour question would be more suited to r/learnpython sub. However, I believe that there is no problem to try to help you over here. You problem is that you are trying to acess individual elements of an int in a array fashion. But an int is an number, thus this approach makes no sense. You could store your input string as an str, transform it in a list, then conver each element to int, using list comprehension. Eg: str_list = list(input_str) int_list = [ int(i) for i in str_list]
Exactly my questions too. The README doesn't say much about their workflow. How do they actually use this? A script that sends a photo isn't that much automation.
Seems really weird. Python shell runs it ok
The thought is appreciated :-)
May I ask why do you use print instead of the logging module? I actually saw a video the other day about why using logging is better than print. Is there a disadvantage in using logging?
It's the opposite of russian
The OP's question is what habits did you wish you had _unlearned_... **logging** is vastly superior to **print**, please read the above again.
He is answering things to **unlearn**. So logging is better than print.
Oh, sorry I read learned.
&gt; What Python habits do you wish you unlearned earlier? Honestly, none. If I have any bad habits specifically relating to Python (aside from such language-agnostic bad habits as over-engineering stuff and hence never finishing...) then I don't know what they are. There was one bad habit I had when I was a newbie: for i in range(len(mylist)): item = mylist[i] but I unlearned that PDQ so I can't really say I wish I had unlearned it earlier.
[Python Tricks](https://realpython.com/products/python-tricks-book/) My review here: [https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2662636609](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2662636609) Copy/Paste of review: Wanted to check out this book so downloaded it. Most of the times I do this it ends up with me buying the actual book at the end so do not feel that guilty confessing this "habit". With "Python Tricks" was very early 100% sure that it would end up with a purchase which happened. What I want from a coding book is always the same two things: (1) feel sad+happy while reading it: sad for parts of my codebase and happy that I am reading it, (2) Understand better patterns of the programming language and also be able to write better code, and if possible more idiomatic. Book delivers both. immediately changed parts of some applications after reading the decorators chapter, while the PDF will be on my desktop folder ready to help change or write differently some parts of the current projects. Some of the material has been posted on-line from the author but the book really delivers that extra which justifies a purchase from everyone coding in Python (in-my-not-so-humble-opinion). Last but not least if acquired from the book's site &lt;https://realpython.com/products/python-tricks-book/&gt; there are 12 (!) videos about the main concepts discussed with live coding sessions with author explaining the rationale behind each decision.
Thanks!! Will definitely check this out. :)
The only problem with Telegram for me is that all the people i need to communicate with use Whatsapp instead :(
Yep - Rust's implementation is more elegant, but its community uses prelude::* imports more than python uses * imports.
He's Putin them away for later
Tried it. "Everybody i know is in Whatsapp, so no" :(
This is how I file pics I take of myself and my partner so we both always have them.
 Google almost made it the defacto messaging standard. It may have some limitations but it would have been nice to have ubiqitous service like email.
MMS? If you could teach him how to open a folder and picture or video file on a computer, you could setup Dropbox to drop stuff in a folder on his desktop or tablet.
&gt; OOP is a good idea in theory and a bad one in practice Finally someone is saying it. 
&gt; Thinking regular expressions were self-documenting enough I've never been silly enough to think that complex regexes are self-documenting. Small and/or trivial regexes may be -- nobody who knows basic regex syntax should need re.VERBOSE for something like `r'\s*(-?\d+)\s*'. I'm so confident that it's self-documenting (to those who know regex syntax) that I'm not going to explain it or test it... :-) The hard part is knowing where to draw the line between "simple and obvious" and "complex and obfuscated, needs re.VERBOSE". My rule of thumb is that if I can write it and have it work correctly the first time, it's probably simple enough that it doesn't need VERBOSE. Since I'm not very good at writing regexes, not many of them work correctly the first time :-) &gt; Using print instead of logging. &gt; Using os module process launching instead of subprocess. &gt; Concatenation instead of str.format. There's absolutely nothing wrong with those when used appropriately. `print` for debugging is a hell of a lot easier than logging, which means I'll actually do it rather than put it off. `os.system` is fine for its use-case: you want to call a hard-coded external program and you don't care about passing data back and forth to it. Just call it, let it run, and continue. `plural = somestring + 's'` is easier to write, easier to read, and more efficient than `plural = '{}s'.format(somestring)`. &gt; Ever using reload. `reload` is fine when used for exploratory programming in the interactive interpreter: Edit, Run, Edit, Reload, Run again. I can't imagine wanting to use `reload` in any other circumstance. &gt; Using inheritance -- especially multiple inheritance -- instead of composition. *shrug* I've never had an inheritance hierarchy complex enough that it was a problem, but I'm aware that there are good reasons to prefer composition. and I often do so. I wouldn't make a hard rule "never use inheritance", and I don't understand why so many people consider inheritance and composition to be *competing techniques*. Isn't it obvious that they are complementary? I can write a class that uses composition, then inherit from that class. Or vice versa. 
&gt; I think getting over the habit of mixing I/O with business logic is the most significant improvement I ever made That's not precisely a *Python* habit though, it's language agnostic. 
Getting the latest version of the python helper bot onto the pi that runs it, and maybe looking at building a few language models. I want a set of tools that make the logic behind the bot simpler to manage, such as automatic sentence ordering, new line insertion, and compound sentence generators. This way I can just add sentences that I feel like the bot should say, without worrying about ordering and the associated mess of "If this is said, say these two things in this way unless that case is also true" and if a few sentences can be merged into a coherent compound sentence, it'd be nice if it just took care of that. On the one hand, it's unlikely that these models will be significantly better than random (not to mention compared to state of the art), on the other hand the bot says so little that random isn't that bad and it offers me a baseline for future work. 
You'll get an error: you provided too many arguments: look at the signature of `C.__init__` again.

It's not about performance. It's that Python offers multiple models of concurrency, but neither one of them works / they didn't know how to do it well. 1. Threading in Python: you can only sleep in parallel, but you cannot do anything useful in parallel. 2. Processing: communication and coordination is so bad, you want to throw yourself out of the window if you ever have to do this for real: what about hunting down child processes which are still running in your program when you want to exit it, but it won't exit? What about sending things you cannot pickle to the other process? What about inheriting from `multiprocessing.Process` and then having `self` in the instance of sublcass be different things inside `__init__` and `run`? 3. `yield` / `async` stuff: even worse than threads, a single blocking call in your event loop will block your whole program and other "interesting features". 4. Interfacing with better libraries, which offer platform-agnostic parallel processing, like MPI. Well, it's not Python, obviously... Now, add to this meshes of all the four you inevitably get if you write real programs, not toy examples for your presentation: this is the worst clusterfuck you will find than there exists in any language you know.
thanks for the detailed answer. UTF-8 seems to hold information in more compact form for latin symbols. Someone mentions here modern python interpreters encode in utf-16. Other than compactness of latin symbols, what is the benefit of UTF-16 over UTF-8?
If you're testing your project by just trying stuff out in the command line and checking if it looks right, it takes about as much time to write that same thing into a test using `pytest` etc.. But you'll get the benefit of accidentally building up a pretty decent test suite for your project. Also debuggers are a billion times better than random print statements, especially a built-in one like in PyCharm.
Was expecting a generative model of her daughter's face to create infinite photos
Python is definitely not "made for" AI and data science; that's just the areas in which it's excelling right now. But Python is accessible and mature enough that it can be applied to anything from web development through games to blockchain. I once wrote an article for my company blog about it, give it a read if you'd like: [https://stxnext.com/blog/2018/01/17/why-python/](https://stxnext.com/blog/2018/01/17/why-python/) &amp;#x200B; On the other hand, if you're looking for ways to develop "Android software", then you'll need something other than Python to develop the frontend of your app. Probably the easiest way right now to create quality mobile apps is using JavaScript and React Native, and guess what: [https://stxnext.com/blog/2018/06/14/why-use-react-native-your-mobile-app/](https://stxnext.com/blog/2018/06/14/why-use-react-native-your-mobile-app/) &amp;#x200B; What's great about both Python and React Native is that the communities for both are quite big and you can find answers to most common problems, and even ready-made libraries and out-of-the-box solutions that you can apply very quickly to your project.
Nope. Whatever `pip` does there's no guaranty it will do it again, even if given the same input. `pipenv` uses `pip` to do whatever it does, so the same reasoning applies there. Except, `pipenv` does it few times (so quite a bit slower), but the basic idea is still the same.
What you want is Signal, in terms of privacy and features. Security is locked down more than others
Python newbie here. I write loops like this and don‚Äôt know what PDQ is offhand. What do I need to correct about the structure of the loop to make it better? List comprehension or just be more thoughtful with wording to make it more clear? Thanks for your post!
Exactly. Most of my photos are exported from Lightroom. I have no use of the exported JPEG once it was sent.
1. you absolutely can do usefull stuff in parallel, examples from a recent project: one thread manages UI, one camera I/O, one interface of UI and camera, another one manages user timeout and finally one for parallel access to system I/O. All of that is useful stuff that doesn't need multiple processes/performance and thus can use threading 2. You can literally use Queues (atomic message queues) for communication. If you don't like them: serialize or use sockets. I've done all of it and it works great. I pretty much always inherit from multiprocessing.Process and never had a problem, what do you mean? 3. asynchronous programming is NOT parallel programming (that's why it has a different name). That's also not specific to python but rather the base concept of async/await, if something blocks it's supposed to hand control back to the event loop, if it doesn't it's because you programmed it wrong. 4. Python multiprocessing is already platform agnostic (again recent project: running cross plattform on linux and windows) and: if you use Jython or IronPython then the other libraries are native to python; by your logic multiprocessing and threading wouldn't be python either because they use C in their implementation. Also if you don't like any of these methods you can always write an extension yourself to do it better and use it in your absolutely bare-bones CPython installation

Pretty Darned Quick
In python lists are iterable so instead of making a loop for range of length of list, you can just do for list: for i in input_list Print(I) I think pdq just means ‚Äúpretty dang quickly‚Äù
I'm also not sure what PDQ stands for, but this style of iteration is considered not very Pythonic. You would get something less verbose by doing as follows: for item in mylist: # use `item` directly here The idea is that you don't need to loop over a `range` of indices (which is actually a Python iterable), so you're better off just iterating on the list itself. 
in that example you could just do: for item in mylist: ... or if you actually need i in the for loop just use enumerate
Think of it this way: all python for loops iterate lists because range() function just returns list of ints.
How do you store, track, audit, but most important distribute `.env` files in your team? 
Pythonic for item in items: print(item) 
Ill find some time to read both topics, thank you! :) Im not sure what am I interested in at the moment, thats why im looking for language that could be usefull for everything not just websites or android Apps. Im a bit affraid of AI and data science...name scares me tho. But I would like to work with Javascript as well. 3
Why using print instead of logging? I prefer logging.
I‚Äôm still trying to kick a serious bad habit: python 2.7
a_varargs and v_varargs are lists. so you have to say: an_instance = C(1, 2, 3, 4, [5,6,7,8], [9,10,11]) 
Looks great! I've been through the pain of aligning and stacking images manually using Fiji - I would have loved an automatic tool!
Aw i think I hurt it's feelings
What would be a more pythonic way of writing something like this? for i in range(3, len(mylist)+2): item = mylist[i]
 raise IndexError('list index out of range') 
TIM-The Insult Machine. https://github.com/steve-shambles/TIM-The-Insult-Machine My first repo, no idea what github is all about really tbh. Hardcore insult generator (adults only) with GUi, word lists are editable and a clean version available. Uses gTTs to speak the insults, currently 26.9 billion possible insults and a surprising amount make sense and TIM sometimes comes up with some original funny phrases like "foamy underpants" (whatever they are) for example, well it made me laugh anyway. The code needs tightening up, I know it's naff in places but I am still a beginner really.
Oh, wow! I need this in my life. I guess I'll need to make it.
&gt; Using inheritance -- especially multiple inheritance -- instead of composition. I'm very passionate about this one. Inheritance isn't bad, but it (and classes in general) is so overused. I blame Java.
Inheritance gets complicated quickly. It's more restrictive. It's easy to get wrong. Basically you want to keep your code as decoupled as possible. If you make a class hierarchy, it should make *sense*. Like Camry -&gt; Car; that's fine. Inheriting from Kitchen because you want the Sink is dumb.
I didn't use virtual environments for the first 4 or 5 years of my Python journey.
This is the real "RESIST" movement. Objects (classes) are a great tool, but are so overused. OOP to me is like if someone came up with Hammer Oriented Carpentry; like what if I need a saw? No, I don't want to use a serrated hammer, I want a saw.
I'm nowhere near the first, but sure I'll take credit.
My friend group left hangouts for telegram years ago, never looked back. it‚Äôs better in just about every way. 
Besides the day job, working on a little side thing for generating pixel art from images. It works okay now but still needs work. Need to learn more about image processing and filters and such. So far I've just been winging it and making up heuristics by myself.
Serrated hammer. That's good. I'm stealing that.
Appreciate a constructive answer! Will check it out.
You‚Äôre not alone
https://pythonclock.org/ You have: `11 months 21 days` (before most of open-source universe celebrates dropping Python 2 for good)
When you say ‚Äúsidebar‚Äù, I‚Äôm not sure what you mean. I‚Äôm on an iPhone app and I don‚Äôt see anything that would resemble a sidebar. Sorry if I‚Äôm being dense, I suspect I‚Äôm missing something obvious. 
I wasn't speaking in absolute "this is verboten" voice, I'm just saying prefer **logging** to **print**, **subprocess** to **os.system**, etc... That said, if I see **print** in non-trivial production code I visibly shudder, because it's _only_ good for quick debugging and it's presence implies that the job has been half-arsed. Same with **os.system**, because I know I'm going to have to rewrite it. And again with **reload**, which is as terrifying in production code as **sys.path** manipulation. As for **re.VERBOSE**, sure there's a discretionary line, but there's essentially no cost to using it and some cost to not doing so, dependent entirely on the fluency of your reader with regex... it costs me nothing to put it in and if it saves someone a few minutes of brain power down the road it's a net gain. And yeah, you can inherit from something built with composition -- nothing stops a masochist from masochisting -- but again overall I wish I'd always known prefer composition over inheritance.
Thanks! :D There are quite a few applications for aligning images, my application is just a small personal project üòÑ - I recommend [Siril](https://www.siril.org/) or [Deep Sky Stacker](https://github.com/LucCoiffier/DSS/releases). Deep Sky Stacker is more user-friendly but only for Windows, while Siril is more powerful and available for Linux, Windows and macOS, but it's bit more complex to use.
Nope, it's a beautiful efficient iterable object. `range` returning a list is Python-2-only, and on the way out.
/u/awegge is right that you code would raise an IndexError since you try to access elements beyond the list length. If we forget that +2 in your code for a moment a more pythonic way to write your code would be: for item in mylist[3:]: # do something with item
Someone give this man one credit! 
IIRC enumerate loads the entire list into memory, so be careful if it‚Äôs a big one
Oops, that was a rogue ‚Äú+2‚Äù. Thanks!
Yeah it's definitely got it's uses -- ABCs are great when you've got to build a plug-in architecture -- but it got pushed so hard as _the_ paradigm and there's just no making sense of some of the inheritance trees I've seen, or the costly messes it's gotten the companies I've worked for into as they tried to scale.
Interesting I‚Äôm going to start my grow again and was thinking about doing similar only I have deep water culture so monitor tank levels. 
It's much easier to compare to WhatsApp because that's what it started as a clone of. It gets around some of WhatsApp's worst points (like its shitty web client and Facebook ownership) and has generally stayed ahead of it in terms of features. 
XMPP does not have e2e built in, as I understand it; it's a plug-in which all participants' servers would need to have enabled, same as email. And very few people can easily encrypt their emails.
The caller has the burden of packaging the `*c` args into a single `c`. Another comment mentions using a list, which would work fine. I was just being a bit more general by saying iterable. A list is an iterable; you can call `iter()` on it or use it in a for loop.
I've just used enumerate on its own and it returns an `enumerate` iterator object rather than a list. So it seems that, no, the list is not loaded entirely into memory.
Matrix is the closest we've got right now, I think. It's a work in progress but fairly popular in some circles. Website is matrix.io and the reference client is riot.im.
I can send myself gigabyte sized files and have high speed everything. Fuck yeah it's better. What's the limit on attachmwnra nowadays? Fucking 25 measly mb or something??
Is signal any more locked down than whatsapp? They use the same encryption protocol, the only difference is that signal promises not to keep most of the metadata they get from you (and it's just a promise, they are capable of keeping it), where WhatsApp is almost certainly hoovering that shit up.
Strings are iterable so there's no need for a list [int(x) for x in str(n)] 
Hmm. I wonder why I thought that it did .. 
My brain still can't settle on whether to use " or '. 
Yeah. I really wish Py3 did a few simple things to help out that transition. For example: given a dictionary d, if they added d.iterkeys() as an alias for d.keys() , it would be so much easier (yeah, view vs iterator, but basically the same). Unfortunately, because they didnt, the preferred way is now &gt;Import six six.iterkeys(d) ü§Æ
Nice list! What's reload?
after ten long years, I feel like your fate is sealed.
Same here, and the import function got really slow after some time. To be fair, on Windows a lot of modules aren't installed cleanly from pip unless you have the right compiler and development libraries installed. So you can't start from scratch each time, without a lot of frustration.
http://norvig.com/lispy.html
You should add a template `.env` file to the repository that contains all the possible variables. Then the other devs in your team can make a local copy of it and fill out the corresponding values. If there is a new variable in the template, then yes, you have to add it manually to your local `.env` file, but I think it's not a real issue since usually you have only a few variables and default values can also be given. You can also add a `post-checkout` script that notifies your colleagues if there's a new variable and a manual sync with their local `.env` file is required.
if it's a list, it's already in memory, so caution is needed before that point ;-) Like the other dude said, enumerate is a generator-like thin wrapper maintaining a counter. https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#enumerate says it's roughly equivalent to def enumerate(sequence, start=0): n = start for elem in sequence: yield n, elem n += 1 
It reloads an import that has already been imported. A unicorn gets kneecapped and flesh eating ghouls are spawned in your code each time it's used. By which i mean: there may be unexpected side effects from using this feature which could cause subtle, hard to diagnose/detect bugs/errors/behaviors. I think avoiding reload is good practise.
For iterables that do not implement slicing, you may use [itertools.islice](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/itertools.html) from itertools import islice for item in islice(my_list, 3, None): pass 
Is this really the best? Looks like an ad post
do you really need your software to support running on both 2 and 3 out of the same codebase? usually people juts ditch 2

Have you considered - has it crossed your mind, during the thought that you clearly put into this post and indeed this issue - that you are trying to subscript an int? Which the language doesn't allow? Tell me if I'm going too fast here. I mean, the error message does explicitly say that that's exactly what's happening but why would you read that, right? So look at bits of your code where you're trying to subscript something. Look also at bits of your code where variables are integers. Hey look! At a number of points, you are indeed trying to subscript an integer! Do you think the language allows that? If only there was some way of the language telling you when you're trying to do something it doesn't allow. I wonder what the fix is if you're trying to do something the language doesn't allow. Is it, maybe, to just not do that thing? That doesn't solve the problem of what your code is actually trying to do, of course, but I assume you don't want help with that because the obvious thing if you wanted your code to actually work would be to tell us what you want it to do, rather than just saying "help??". Oh, and /r/learnpython

One thing I've seen with many of our in-house students and some coworkers, due to lack of focus on points like library usage in many books, tutorials and workshops: Reinventing wheels (pun intended) with one-liners and utility functions is quite easy in Python, but they tend to go undertested and usually require additional maintenance and consideration later. Usually there are more efficient implementations provided in the standard library. When there is not, decent and established libraries for those tasks are usually available in the cheese shop.
Yeah this one sucked. I bit the bullet early and got into 3, but it was a real pain at first.
The common problem that I have is a large codebase running various legacy applications and including a number of utility functions, database accessors, etc. I don't want to go touch all the old stuff that's running just fine. However, I want to re-use some of the components, but they won't work in Py3. So my options are: 1) port the whole codebase and all legacy applications to Py3 (I don't want to do this) 2) Clone the codebase so we maintain a Py2 version and a Py3 version (painful) 3) Upgrade just the helper functions I need to work with both Py3 and Py2. However, dual compatibility is hideous because of the lack of simple aliases in Py3. 
Trade offs: Inheritance is much easier to figure out how to do, composition is much better to reason about and maintain. Composition = building creatures out of legos Inheritance = building a taxonomy/tree of creature types I think of composition as the ultimate goal, you simply have less things to build because parts fit together and *compose*. But it's hard to get there sometimes because it's often easier to see the creature as whole rather than a sum of its parts.
Use ' everywhere, except when you have a string that contains ', in which case use ".
For this class of tasks, I ran the task once (without periodic scheduling). Upon finishing execution, I decide the next execution time and schedule it.
Perhaps you had already read the whole file into memory before you used enumerate?
That's actually a good answer, shame there isn't a PEP for this.
Although, thinking about it, couldn't that potentially create an arbitrary mess? trains = [ 'I like trains', "I don't like trains", 'I thought I liked trains', "I didn't know I liked trains" ] 
There isn't, but this is the default way that the Python REPL does things, and it's quite sensible, so I do it.
In that case I guess you could use double quotes for everything? I don't think it matters too much though.
I mean Golang has practically been blasting that in people's faces since it came out
How do? I use envs but I don‚Äôt really understand the full benefits
What the heck is going on with the mobile version of this site? Giant navigation arrows all over the screen.
Oh I don't know why I totally misread, thank you!
I misread the original statement, thanks! 
Both print and pprint has no problem mixing and matching quotes in this way, FYI.
Ah thank you
Ah, I misunderstood the original statement. Thank you for explaining the trade off some. 
That's good to know, I think I'll try and do things this way from now on. :)
Is there a reason to usw virtual environments if i am not sharing my script?
So you can create a virtual env for python3 and it won‚Äôt affect any system python you can create virtual environment for python 2.7 and you can install python2.7 specific libraries with out affecting other libraries installed for other versions 
Of course it's possible. Few years ago i used to make an average of $1500 p.m out of Joomla (yes, that hated CMS) alone on Elance (now Upwork). You need to be REALLY good at what you do and get to know where the jobs are in Python. Also know that there is a huge difference between the jobs available "traditionally" and those available as freelance gigs e.g it's rare to have a company hiring a guy to do web scraping but we have hundreds of web scraping gigs daily. Many of the python freelance jobs available are in automation, web scraping, Django/Flask, basic data analysis (like cleaning up data and presenting in a way that non tech guys can look at, in fact a thorough understanding of Pandas is enough to handle most data related gigs that are available to freelancers). Its possible. Good luck.
Your config file looks like LISP to me. You should try using a LISP Parser. There's a basic one here: [https://gist.github.com/kiran/24935714f36145cff4d15e352f15b827](https://gist.github.com/kiran/24935714f36145cff4d15e352f15b827) &amp;#x200B;
You are funny... no, threads in Python cannot *do* anything in parallel, they can only *sleep* in parallel. But you probably don't understand the difference, because your argument is just irrelevant. &gt; If you don't like them: serialize or use sockets. Oh, come on... how is this parallel programming? In Python? Why not use CSS, it is just as relevant to the problem as your solution? &gt; asynchronous programming is NOT parallel programming Are you even talking to me / reading what I wrote, because what you wrote is a completely irrelevant nonsense, that has nothing to do with what I wrote earlier. I don't even know what to do with your responses. &gt; Python multiprocessing is already platform agnostic So, this garbage does something on different platforms? Who cares? It's still garbage... ---- Why would I write a language extension to a shitty language? I have an interesting and demanding job, very little free time, other hobbies... But, most importantly, how would this affect the quality of nonexistent parallel programming in Python?
it's nice...
So just amend the rule to to include "except where that introduces unnecessary inconsistency"
Yeah. My code is a dependency. Therefore I‚Äôm lazy and develop on the lowest common denominator.ya. 75% code coverage is great, but those error cases hit so infrequently and harbor a few Python n 3 bugs. It‚Äôs still an error, just a lousy message. V
No, that is not a problem: `enumerate` most certainly does not load the entire list into memory. It's easy to check: for example, find or create a very large text file and do something like: with open(verylargefile, 'r'): print(max(index) for (index, line) in enumerate(f)) while keeping on eye on the memory usage.
"Static methods" should be referred to as "serrated mallets" from now on.
Ok that‚Äôs what I thought 
&gt; plural = somestring + 's' is easier to write, easier to read, and more efficient than plural = '{}s'.format(somestring). I would argue that plural = f"{somestring}s" is the easiest to read and write. 
My dude, do a hypercube
I would probably just do for i, item in enumerate(items): if i &lt; 3: continue do_stuff_with(item) 
I'll follow the image and press -1. I hate ads.
`f.readlines()` loads the whole file into memory. Maybe you used that.
Well, I taught myself Python 3 so it was a hard time full of horrible code and I had a LOT of bad habits: * Monkey Patching... * using 2 lists instead of a dictionary (I had no clue how dicts worked -.-) * rewriting all classes into separate functions... * mixing Camel-Case and Snake-Case names with no order (thanks Rust for teaching me a unified way :3) * f = open("file", "rb").read().decode("utf-8") # -.- * using os module for paths instead of pathlib, or even better "folder{}path{}file".format(pathseperator) * r"\\unescaped\\backslash" * using urllib (requests is such an awesome library :3) * (indenting with tabs and spaces for additional padding) * unnecessary loops and then list(sorted(set())) * parsing EVERY TYPE OF INPUT and printing to the Console instead of raising an error * try: except: # catching everything... I am so lucky that these times are over ;)

Yes: to manage multiple environments on your same machine. In particular, if you‚Äôre working on two different scripts that are developed against different versions of a library (or even different versions of Python), you can do that cleanly using virtual environments. It‚Äôs also just a good practice and keeps your system clean(er). 
In my opinion it should be the same as in Rust, single quotes for chars (ex. 'a', 'b', '9'....) and double quotes for everything else!
Usually people don't care if they code on their own systems where they know their environment works, their job is quickly done and they don't need to share the script. But say you are working on someone else's system, or want to make sure you can run your own script in the exact same environment couple years later? Documenting everything is usually what we want to do, and having a virtual env means you can save exactly what environment you are using, and when
Wouldn‚Äôt it be easier to just replace those with calls to `d.keys()`? I‚Äôve almost never used iterkeys in Py2.
What you show isn't a recognizable Lisp: too many things look weird: mixing lower and upper case in identifiers, putting closing parenthesis on a separate line, using `function` reader macro on something that doesn't look like a function, while at the same time using Scheme-like boolean constants. So, an off-the shelf Lisp parser will most likely not be able to parse this into anything sensible. However, Lisp syntax is a lot easier than Python, writing a parser takes a day... with a lot of coffee breaks and watching a few TV-shows in between. Basically, what you'll have to implement is: 1. Readtable. 2. http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/f_rd_del.htm `read-delimited-list`. 3. Read this for inspiration: http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/02_b.htm (you don't need to implement all of this from scratch: some parsing already is implemented in Python, other things, like parsing rational numbers and various exponents for floats is probably not supported by your language anyways).
whyuyyyyyuyuyuyu I've been dicking around with python 3 for like half a decade already now
The internal string encoding is an implementation detail so it can vary from one implementation to the next. But modern CPython does not use utf16 anywhere, IIRC. As /u/stevenjd explained, it uses a combination of different encoding depending on what characters the strings contain. The actual names of these encodings are ucs1, ucs2, and ucs4 (the numbers correspond to the number of bytes per character they use). Ucs2 is similar to utf16, but it does not support the _surrogate pairs_ feature to encode code points outside the basic multilingual plane. The difference between ucs2 and utf16 is subtle and not widely known, so a lot of people say "utf16" when they really mean ucs2. Python uses this complicated system so that it can maintain fast string indexing while still keeping strings relatively small. Those three ucs encodings have the property that you can always jump to the nth character in the string by multiplying n by the number of bytes per character and jumping to that byte. You can't jump into the middle of a utf8 stream and know exactly how many characters in you are; to get that information you have to count from the beginning.
About time.
sure, I'll update the imgur album later
Grabbing rinky-dink 5-year-old libraries from pip or github that solve a problem quickly but drag down my codebase by not keeping up with platform changes and preventing other packages from updating. Also, being too liberal with monkey-patching.
Performance? I think that it avoids the global environment from getting bogged down with too many packages. I.e. it's better for your code environment to have only and exactly what you need. That said, uh... I don't really use virtual env because often I'm often just running python interactive out of powershell to play with some idea or whatever.
Reading a book on using Django and then going to build a small website using the Django framework! Any tips are more than welcome! I'm a beginner to it all.
Outsourcing, I like it.
It usually is because you need traits in the namespace to be able to use them. But even then, because you have a private first approach, there's far less chance of collision than python. And if you have a collision it will tell you at compile time , at which point you can be specific. So from a error perspective , you can't have the issues python does. From a readability perspective, if you're in someone else's code that can have issues if you're unfamiliar with where members are coming from, if that's your main concern.
Maybe. Iterkeys was the recommended thing to use in Py2 due for memory reasons (and that's why it's the default in Py3). It's weird to go back and remove all the good practices from my Py2 code, especially if I needed them for large dictionaries. 
This is wild, cool stuff

I would argue that your path separator logic is flawed.

Came here to say this. A few things black does annoys me. However, it is really nice not having to think about it.
&gt; using os module for paths instead of pathlib, or even better "folder{}path{}file".format(pathseperator) Is there any OS around that doesn't understand forward slashes as path separator? I know windows will show backslashes, but AFAIK it just accepts forward slashes.
Watch me put a square peg in a round hole. Struct methods and interfaces all the way down. 
No I didn‚Äôt, but maybe I read that and note and confused myself. 
What library would one use to automate a daughter?
I've actually had to move from subprocess back to os in one project. The system was memory constrained and since subprocess uses fork, there always has to be at least as much free memory as is currently in use by the parent to effect the copy. It felt dirty. 
I see in theory how virtual environments can be good but for me to use practically it never made sense. I just pip install upgrade my requirements file for different environments and it works extremely well. Are there reasons I'm missing or not understanding?
For my first project I'm building a web-scraper in Python to search different websites for deals on Steam games.
Hey, how u made it and what is the use of it
When you're looking at a sub, there should be an icon that brings up so.e kind of menu. Mine says "card view" and "view sidebar." The sidebar is an "about" page for the sub.
I'm not even convinced go has any holes to put things in. It's like a stack of square pegs stuck to each other with glue made out of melted square pegs.
They are *literally* the same number of characters to type: somestring + 's' # 16 characters (including two optional spaces) f'{somestring}s' # 16 characters Using `+` for concatenation goes back to before Python 1.5 (making it 20+ years old), it is a common operator in other languages, and even if you've never seen `+` used for concatenation before, it's pretty obvious to guess what it means. And concatenation seems to be faster: [steve@ando cpython-master]$ ./python -m timeit -s 'x = "aardvark"' 'x + "s"' 200000 loops, best of 5: 1.33 usec per loop [steve@ando cpython-master]$ ./python -m timeit -s 'x = "aardvark"' 'f"{x}s"' 200000 loops, best of 5: 1.57 usec per loop The misleadingly-called "f-strings"^1 are a new feature that tens of thousands of Python programmers cannot use yet and may never have seen before. If you haven't learned about f-strings, that line would be as mysterious as `z"[somestring]s"` is to you. If you disagree, then please tell me what semantics I have in mind for "z-strings". I promise you that I do have real semantics in mind. Can you guess what they are? ^1 F-strings are not strings, they're executable code. Like `eval` they can execute arbitrary code and can have side-effects. The only main difference between f-string syntax and a call to eval() is that the result of an f-string is automatically coerced to a string. 
&gt;You are funny... no, threads in Python cannot *do* anything in parallel, they can only *sleep* in parallel. But you probably don't understand the difference, because your argument is just irrelevant. For the benefit of all, could you expand on this ?
1. I literally never heard anyone calling it "sleeping in parallel" - What you mean is that actually only one thread is executed at the same time and the others sleep in that time, is it that? If so that's the GIL, an implementation detail of CPython and I literally adressed it in my first comment. It also doesn't make threading worthless as my examples show and while the code doesn't execute at the actual same time it still is considered parallel programming. And again, that's ONLY the threading module and only in CPython, literally any other case in Python is actually executing in parallel. 2. What? Are you dense? Sockets are a legitimate way of interprocess communication - and again that was the solution if you don't like the built in atomic message queues, locks, serialization events etc. that are in the same way present in for example C# 3. You said yield/async and since yield has absolutely nothing to do with parallel programming I assumed you were talking about asynchronous programming (you know - the async keyword that you used) and my reply was related to that; but oh well I guess you're just not capable of using English properly 4. You said that interfacing with another library isn't python (which wasn't true) and specified that these libraries are platform agnostic which is a moot point as python is by design platform agnostic so there's no additional value gained by using these libraries. And to the garbage: yeah fuck you, that's it 5. Oh aren't you something, such a big boy. And you don't even understand it, beautiful. Seriously, I spent some time while having dinner to read a few of your other posts: you seem like the biggest know-it-all douchebag that actually has no idea what he's talking about and just is a pain-in-the-ass for everyone.
Black screen being a terminal? Typing ‚Äúpython‚Äù or ‚Äúpython3‚Äù should open a shell from terminal. There‚Äôs usually the idle exe in the download location. If you‚Äôre in Mac, I suggest looking into PyCharm as an environment. On Windows and Linux, I‚Äôm a fan of Anaconda. 
Or just for i, item in enumerate(items[3:], 3): do_stuff_with(item)
you can refer to the link in the readme file under that project. this poject is like conway's game: no practical usage and just for fun. but it seems that "transformers" transforms muck like in the same way...
Yes totally agree. As you noted counting syllables is only approximate, I'm not aware of any algo that can produce syllable counts with 100% accuracy. If you are aware of something, please let me. Would love to improve. Ultimately, the simple approximation works reasonably well. Based on my tests and comparisons with other implementations the scores produced have been fairly good
Yes it's definitely the terminal, and I am using windows. I tried typing and entering python, python3, "python", and "python3". But, nothing really happened.
Does &gt;&gt;&gt; appear after entering python? Entering that should run a shell IN the terminal window (I thought)
Bingo. I don't like every little decision black makes. I love not making the decisions anymore. Far outweighs my dislike of some fidgety personal style things.
PDQ = "Pretty Damn Quick". Don't do this: for i in range(len(mylist)): item = mylist[i] Instead: for item in mylist: ... If you need both the index and the item: for index, item in enumerate(mylist): ... 
Do you have any recommended places to start learning how to use virtual environments? 
10 years of using Python and I'm still amazed by what can be accomplished with it. 
It‚Äôs also removed from the default namespace when moving from python 2 to 3. Does anyone know of a better way to run code repeatedly from the interpreter after making small changes and keeping your data objects in memory? I used it for so long and still do because i see no other option but it has caused name collisions that took me wayyy too long to diagnose. 
I'm new to Python. what's the benefit of logging over print? 
As for me I use Visual Studio Code for small, quick scripts and I use PyCharm for bigger projects and web dev. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) launches pretty quickly and has a ton of plugins, such as linters, formatters and debuggers. VS Code on it's own is a pretty powerful Python IDE, but I only use it if I need to compose something small. [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) on the other hand is pretty heavy yet extremely powerful with a great prediction engine and lots of useful plugins. You can install the Community version for free to try it out. Since you're a beginner, PyCharm Edu is also a great pick. It's the same as Community, but it also got an EduTools plugin pre-installed, which will give you access to great Python courses on Stepik for free.
I have a hard time understanding what PyCharm is telling me is wrong with my code with those red marks on the right? any advice? 
How about pickling them to a file and loading them up again? Pretty hacky; but so is reload ;-)
That doesn‚Äôt look messy at all to me?
I used it to basically use the same scrapers that some of the Kodi Apps used to send a link to real-debrid, get a stream link back and cast it to chromecast

I just downloaded that!
&gt; what is the benefit of UTF-16 over UTF-8? I believe that most use of UTF-16 is for historical reasons. The first Unicode standard thought that 16-bits would be enough, and the Windows "wide char" data type was based on that. I think Java followed suit, as did Javascript. But Unicode soon realised that 32768 characters was not enough (there are more Chinese characters alone than that!) and expanded the system to the full 23-bits we use now. However, UTF-16 may be more compact if you use a lot of East Asian characters -- or it might not be, it depends on which East Asian characters you use. Provided that you don't use any so-called ["astral characters"](http://opoudjis.net/unicode/unicode_astral.html), UTF-16 has the advantage over UTF-8 that it is effectively a fixed-width system^1. The first 32768 Unicode characters use exactly two bytes, unlike UTF-8 where they can vary from 1 to 3 bytes. That makes string processing easier. But in practice, UTF-16 is not actually that much better, unless you do what Javascript does and simply not support surrogate pairs. If we were inventing Unicode today, we'd probably only use UTF-8 and UTF-32 and not bother with UTF-16. ^1 But not *actually* fixed width. Technically, as /u/ingolemo points out, UTF-16 is variable width: every character requires either 2 bytes, or 4. Javascript's alleged UTF-16 is actually not: it is more like a related but different standard, UCS-2, which is like UTF-16 but limited to only the first 32768 characters. Of course when I say character, I actually mean code point, but the difference is technical. 
I don't believe that there is [an UCS-1 standard encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Coded_Character_Set). Perhaps you are thinking of the rarely used [UTF-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-1)? That's a variable 1 to 5 byte encoding.
Why java.. its more like a developer tool.. java doesnt force you to create hierarchies...
You can't send it to anyone not on telegram, limit is zero mb in that situation. Whereas email can provide a link to unlimited resources to literally anyone with internet access because everyone has at least one email address. That's the difference between federated and walled garden.
I agree, but it's not there yet. Primarily because it's not dead simple to get going like email. 
I love looking at these 4d shapes and trying to understand them but I always inevitably fail. Apparently if there was a 4d being, they would be able to see inside our bodies, like we'd be able to see inside a 2d body. My brain just can't compute it, no matter how hard I try. Working mathematically with higher dimensions helps... but not really.

Internally, CPython refers to it as [`Py_UCS1`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/75e4699b31d1d88abad097ad13466c5c07711324/Include/unicodeobject.h#L104). I assumed it was an alias for iso8859-1 in the same way that ucs4 is effectively identical to utf32. It's a name that is in use, even if it's not official.
Thank you for the links. Saving these for after work 
I kinda hate pycharm. It's great Ide but all in all its quite overkill for most homemade projects. I personally recommend VSCode and Sublime Text for 4 main reasons : - lightweight and super fast boot especially compared Visual Studio and Pycharm, Clion etc. - amazing &amp; deep yet super simple modular customisation that make them feel like full fledge IDE like Clion or Pycharm. - really clean and modern UI. - outstanding language support ( you can basically open every text base file and download in 10 sec the syntax color matching the format). I also enjoy Atom a lot, but I heard there can be compatibility issues when updating packages / atom version. I think Pycharm is only worth it if you are working on a large scale project. 
"Parents Blame Rise In Teen Uranium Enrichment" Yeah it might need some work. "Vanilla Ice To Work With Amish In New TV Show Just Hours After Getting Out Of 7-Season Series" Nope nevermind, most of those could definitely pass as a headline. Honestly its quite neat in general, nice work.

I'm just joking about how everything is a class in Java. A lot of people will default to creating a class for everything in Python when your base organizational unit should really be a module.
You might need to checkout /r/raspberry_pi One being, you'll have to benchmark your max processing used on the microcontroller with your existing algorithm, vs the max on an Rpi. Not to mention, you'll probably face the same overheating problems because it doesn't have a built in cooling system. RPis have a little cooling add ons but from what i've heard they're not too effective as a liquid or cooling coil. By any chance is your image detecting being done on water? (Sub?) If so you can judy modify the casing to include a cooling pipe from the surrounding water onto the RPis cpu
Erm. The general idea is when you click that margin and that red circle appears, whenever you run your program in debug mode, and it reaches a red circle, it will pause execution, and you can dip in a see what's going on. You should be able to see a list of all the variables defined at that point, and handily if you click the little calculator icon, you can execute code as if you're in REPL mode. There's also other things like adding conditions to the stop, and watch expressions. All good stuff

Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
They both use fork(). Can't get a subprocess without it. I think you must be describing a effect of not using exec() [aka "the world's most efficient garbage collector"], thus carrying two process images worth of allocated heap. The solution to that is simple: set up your subprocesses earlier, before you allocate all the storage you're using on the heap.
Ah yes, the padding was too much for small screen sizes. I hope that looks better now. Most appreciated. 
Now my brain hurts.
PyCharm does a great job automating it all for you. All you have to do is enable it when you create the project.
But you can do that with the app from your phone...just confused about what the library does that a normal user couldn‚Äôt already control without it. I also only have a single device on my network so I might be misunderstanding what additional possibilities there would be if you had multiple. 
Ah ok that makes sense! 
I‚Äôm not familiar with real-debrid, can you tell me about it? I did a quick google on it but I‚Äôm curious what kind of stuff you could get there as opposed to streaming services/YouTube.

I have done that, but pickle gets very slow for big objects. So when you have a 8GB database you're working on, pickling it is not an option. And that just responds to the storage of objects, where I'm asking about a way to update my command line functions on the fly.
os.system() does not use fork(). It was a specific solution for a specific combination of problems, not a best practice.

I‚Äôll make the plug for Spyder - install via homebrew, Macports, or straight using pip. The latest beta, V4.00b is rock solid and has all the necessary components needed of an IDE.
In comparison to email, the methods of a user getting set up are a higher bar. I don't know how to define the issue well, but the average person sees that bar as too high.
What they aren't telling you is how they know good and well that if you as a human started to learn Python and knew or found out what Reddit was, you'd naturally come to /r/python and ask your question. Because that's the intuitive thing to do. What they should do is abandon /r/learnpython, and use /r/advancedpython or /r/pythonnews and allow noobs to use /r/python for *gasp* learning the python language. For some weird reason, almost nobody thinks what I wrote above is a good idea. So we're all going to collectively shake our fists and yell at clouds and try to fight human nature, and maybe badmouth the people who do the 100% perfectly natural thing of coming here to ask questions about Python. (If I sound bitter it's because I've read some really harsh responses to said questions and it makes me ashamed of those people.)
I tried and still doesn't work, but thank you 
Ive gone through the first 6 chapters in Python Crash Course this week. I had been going through Learn Python the Hard Way which was going well when suddenly at lesson 43, I couldn't break past it. So I decided to start with crash course instead of blindly trying to complete that book. Then I plan to go back and complete that book. 
I want to start working on either an encryption program or a password system this week. Furthermore I'll be trying to find a way to hide my long lists of code and still utilise them.
hehe same ! also if the 4d being whould manage to pass through our 3d space, we would see a 3d-slide of him \^\^ and two slices of him could be at the same time in different positions 
I can't believe you have positive votes, because my impression is that this sub mostly feels the opposite. It's almost as though /r/python should be the new /r/learnpython, and advanced python topics should go in /r/advancedpython or /r/pythonnews. **Then mods wouldn't need to work nearly so hard, and everybody would be happy.** Unless people enjoy complaining? That's a good idea I challenge anybody to CMV. 
Thank you very much!
&gt; In order to protect your privacy, I wanted to make this website work without Javascript. But all of the videos are on YouTube, and YouTube requries Javascript. So if you disable Javascrpt in your browser, you cannot watch YouTube which kind of defeats the whole purpose of this website. Like this: https://youtu.be/F6-nvgnlr9Y Now I don't need your website, and the above link could have been part of your post. :/ I'm pretty sure that's false, that you could link me a URL to youtube without using Javavascript. 
Ahaha ok I think I know what you‚Äôre referring to
But Python doesn't have a separate char type, so this doesn't really fit. In the Python world where a character is just a single-element string, single characters and strings should be written using exactly the same conventions.
I‚Äôm gonna write a schedule planner script since college is starting soon and I‚Äôm gonna need it
Good idea
My only concern with composition is that it can be really awkward to dig down to find the method you need, or you need to write loads of trivial wrapper methods which just call the methods of the inner objects. I've found in rust you have to re-implement the same trait methods in the same way quite a bit, although I think that might be changing in the future.
IMO if someone wants to hamstring themselves by using py2, they can just swallow the inefficiencies of `range()`, `d.keys()`.
You can install any version of python entirely in userspace with pyenv.
Use `"` everywhere, unless you have a string that contains `"`, in which case use `'`. That's the standard which `black` uses, on the (very minor) basis that `''` could possibly, with some fonts, be confused for `"`.
Wouldn't you want to use f strings?
yeah, I already get VMs. What about virtual envs makes them better? &amp;#x200B;
TL;DR if condition: statement else: statement if condition: statement elif othercondition: statement else statement The level of this article is better suited for the audience at a beginner programmer subreddit. 
Git works line-based, so if a merge stitches the notebook's JSON lines back together it can happen, that you end up with malformed JSON. Also the generated outputs are saved in the JSON by default, even large BASE64 encoded blobs (e.g. images). If someone just reruns the notebook without changing the actual code cells, all the outputs are recreated, resulting in thousands of changed lines for the next git commit. Its not a trivial format for collaboration.
There are some python web frameworks you could try. Django and flask to name two. I have preference for Django as it comes with everything you need, while flask gives you a bit more flexibility. With Django you just create a project, create some models which represent your resources (they are classes which represent your tables and objects in the db , but look up "active rows" (I think)). Create some views and URL routes and bam, you have a basic web application (obviously there is a lot more too it). With Django you follow an architecture called MVT (model view template) as opposed to MVC (model view controller). This causes some people to be put off, but I don't find it any didn't really. In your case I don't know if you use resources as such, so your views will contain code or calls to/for whatever functionality you're providing and you would return a JSON response as opposed to a template. I won't go through everything, there are a load of tutorials (DjangoGirls) has a good beginners tutorial. Flask gives you more options regarding your architecture, and any other technical aspects like database and ORMs (I typically use something like SQLAlchemy or Mongo (no-sql) when working with flask. If you're creating a restful API, look at using something like swagger to document it. In both Django and Flask there are ways of comparing your request to your swagger file to confirm requests fit the API definition. There are others like Tornado, but I can't comment on them, I haven't used it. More importantly, look at the learnpython subreddit for questions like these (I guess, I'm no mod)
My point is that most companies didnt hamstring themselves intentionally. They used the then-current version (Py2) and best practices such as iterkeys and now are having a harder time migrating because of it. The solution proposed here was to go migrate all legacy Py2 software to less efficient Py2 constructs to make it easier to coexist with Py3. That seems wacky. 
asyncio especially aiohttp. Before that, I wish I knew how to parallelize slow I/O operation with ThreadPoolExecutors and futures.
They mean the [logging module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) and it's better because you can use it for debugging as well as normal output and then change the "level" of output - and where the output goes to - based on what you're doing at the time. It's relatively low effort for lots of benefit.
I run Google Chrome. As one of my Chrome users I switched off Javascript, went to the YouTube site, and could not see anything. It makes sense, because you need Javascript for the Video Player controls to work. So I do maintain that YouTube requires Javascript. Sorry if you trust Google more than you trust me. I assure you that they have a much larger infrastructure for profiting off your personal information than I could ever dream of. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; 
Is that the tesseract? lol you should do that next!
I need to add itertools/more_itertools and raise Exception () from None to clean traceback when raising my own exception inside a catch. And how can I forgot defaultdict, especially defaultdict with a lambda returning a defaultdict (and so on). Want to store counters for something ? Just go counters = defaultdict(int), then counters[var] += 1
I really like Falcon for RESTful API but I wouldn't use it if you are new to Python. There aren't as many resources online about it as Django or Flask. &amp;#x200B; Falcon has a really clean design and I love how it implements middleware in a way much cleaner than Flask. I'm not a fan of its reliance on duck-typing though
On what os does os.system not fork a sub process?
What am I looking at?
&gt; Want to store counters for something ? Just go counters = defaultdict(int), then counters[var] += 1 collections.Counter(sequence) ?
&gt; unnecessary backwards incompatibility This is because of " backward compatibility " that PHP can sometimes be a total clusterfuck (function naming, parameter orders, multiple function for the exact same functionnality, etc.). Although I think Python devs would be much more careful about it, I'm pretty happy they are choosing to not do so :) 
Not if you worry about internationalization, but sure on any string that isn't intended to be read by humans.
Might not be suitable, also it's just a use case. Here's another one, you want to test last run for a given object in a loop: last_runs = defaultdict(lambda: datetime(1970, 1, 1)) if datetime.now() - datetime.timedelta(minutes=5) &gt; last_runs[var]
I was assuming it's an iterable, not a sequence that implements slicing.
Thank you so much! I have a project that I've all but abandoned because I haven't been able to figure out how to use cotexer diagrams, so I'm planning to read through your implementation and see if I can't get my head around this. Do you have any suggestions for particularly helpful reading on generating polytopes?
Basically there's one module intended for calling external processes, and that's **subprocess**... it's much more versatile than **os.system**, and all the other functions on **os** are either low-level primitives you probably don't want to use directly or they're aliases for something in **subprocess** anyway. Short version; just use **subprocess** whenever you want to create or interact with child processes.
Focusing on learning Django. Running through the main tutorials at this point. New semester started this week and I'm in a Introduction to Programming class using Python and a Programming 2 class using Java. Was able to take the second class due to prior experience but still have to take the intro class for the credit.
These are amazingly awesome.
Testing out some snippets or doing some quick plotting in an ipython console, only to have it balloon to 20 lines that I keep iterating on. It's so much more organized to create a quick jupyter notebook, and then three days from now when I wonder what I had done, I have it saved somewhere that I can refer back.
It's a nice render &amp;#x200B;
Hangouts has terrible image compression and just slow to send pictures. Hangouts is still buggy. Telegram is quick and super customizable down to the color of a shadow or bubble. Everything in telegram is customizable. The app itself is organized and searching is quick. It's much Superior to Whatsapp as well if you wanna add a comparison. Give it a shot.

I can't just "give it a shot" because everyone else I know doesn't use it. I'll try to get some people to jump on with me though. That said thanks for the customization info. However, &gt; Hangouts has terrible image compression This actually isn't hangouts' fault, but rather whatever tool you are using to share via hangouts. For example, directly sending images is fine, and so is through the screenshot edit app on my phone, but through samsung's screenshot quick-actions it becomes horrible. &gt; Hangouts is still buggy Can you elaborate? I've been using it for years and have either never come across an issue or haven't noticed one.

It's a violation of the CSV spec found in [RFC 4180](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180) and so a CSV parser wouldn't be expected to handle it. you might want to load it in as a normal file and for each line do a \`line.replace('||@@##', ',') then immediately write it out to another file. THEN try to read that file in as a csv.
Thanks very much, I wasn't aware of the learnPython community, but will certainly check it out. Thanks very much for your help.

Please do not post tutorials on beginner concepts
I would start with the [Virtual Environments and Packages](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) section of the Python tutorial. In fact I'd strongly recommend to read the whole tutorial, I you haven't done yet. This is another thing I should have done earlier myself. To create and manage virtual environments I've used [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/) for several years and it served me very well. More recently I started using [hatch](https://github.com/ofek/hatch), which offers some nice additional features such as upgrading the packages in an environment and releasing a package to PyPI.
 import csv with open('in.txt') as in_file, open('out.csv', 'w') as out_file: fixed = (line.replace('||@@##', ',') for line in in_file) reader = csv.reader(fixed) writer = csv.writer(out_file) writer.writerows(reader)
