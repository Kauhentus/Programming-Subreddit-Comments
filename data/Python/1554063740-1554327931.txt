The command variable that recieves a subproccess call by default is "sam.exe -pitch 64 -speed 72 -mouth 128 -throat 128" that is, it's missing the text from the textbox and thus output nothing.
`which python`.
just put the following lines in some file named sample.pyx i = 32 j = i/2 print(j) &amp;#x200B; compile it using cython: cython sample.pyx It will generate the interpreted code as sample.c You can see, how many steps are needed to execute this simple operation. On the other hand if you do this in C, it's just 5 line program capable of producing bare minimum assembly code. 
Well my Mac has python version 2.7.15 on it but all of the venvs have 3.7.1 in them. I'm not sure if that is all of the information you need?
After seeing this post, I bought the game and source code. This entire project is amazing to me. Great job. Keep making games!
That's not a question. That's a command. `which python` when ran in terminal will give you the path to the current `python` executable, and thus the active virtualenv.
Doh! Thanks for trying so quickly! I think it's fixed. 
`echo $VIRTUAL_ENV`
oh... lol I feel dumb. thank you!
Thank you! Both your and u/K900_ answers works.
Great idea, well implemented. Helps rookies like me. 
Thanks! I enjoy it.

I've been keeping an eye on Rust for a while and I've been intrigued in learning it. How much of an application can it currently have in data science? Are there any libraries for pulling in data from SQL servers, visualisation libraries, stuff like that? Interesting articles!

Making a 2d game with pygame!
I wrote my own NCAA web application in Python and Flask. I am looking for something new to keep learning on. https://www.itsawesomebaby.com/demo
wget works well too ;): wget --convert-links \ --page-requisites \ --span-hosts \ https://example.comb
Working on a project that will index (using Whoosh) a large file structure, grabbing mainly just the path/name of file, ext, size and time created/modified/accessed. Then create a small website with flask (plus some javascript and jquery, new to me) to search on that indexed info, provide links to the files, etc.
The best place would be to go to /r/learnpython but it's never bad to learn. Perhaps python may be more applicable to more areas, but at the least, you will have gotten some sort of basic concepts from r. Learning python won't be bad either
Actually I am also an yet another Deep Learning engineer . I mostly work in NLP. I actually wrote an article about leveraging Rust for data science. You can see it here. [https://medium.com/@rajasekar3eg/making-a-case-rust-for-python-developers-1a114e2d89f4](https://medium.com/@rajasekar3eg/making-a-case-rust-for-python-developers-1a114e2d89f4) [DataBase connection libraries](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-postgres) are there in Rust. Even very easy to use ORM libraries are there. [Diesel](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel) is very popular. [Numpy](https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray) like library, machine learning libraries and Visualization libraries(not as good as python though currently) also exist. But I generally don't do actual data science in Rust. I utilize it for data processing. I deal with huge amount of data in startup. Big clusters are not an option unless it is actually required. I leverage Rust mostly for number crunching and text/data processing which is where python lacks and Rust shines. You can read that article I attached at the beginning to see what I mean. In addition, if you need any performance sensitive functionality, then you can use Rust to build a small library and you can easily python with it. Infact most python libraries are built that way. Numpy on C/Fortran. Tensorflow on C++. I find Rust to be much more pleasant to write than C/C++.

Interesting, thank you for taking the time to reply. I only consider myself an intermediate in Python and I only use it in a data analyst sense (loading in data, manipulating it, making calculations, visualising it, etc) but I very much want to develop myself down the route of a data engineer (rather than a data scientist) and I think that adding another language to my arsenal would be helpful? Originally I was planning on learning either C/C++ or C# but I think Rust may be the language that I am looking for, I'm just not quite sure how I would be able to leverage it based on where I am right now in my journey, but maybe I just need to give it a bit more thought or take a look at some more examples of what Rust is used for. 
You should be learning programming, not a language. Understand programming, understand how the CPU actually works, how cache and memory work. Understand good design patterns vs anti-patterns. Understand Big O notation and good algorithms vs poor. &amp;#x200B; At this point I can program in literally any language (excluding purposefully esoteric ones like 'brainfuck'). Some I can rarely to never pull up the documentation on, other's, especially ones I've never used before, I'll need to take an hour or two to get a feel on then use documentation heavily for a while until I get things down. It's like handing a knife to a chef. Sure, they might take a bit longer with one vs another, or take a few weeks to get muscle-memory for a new knife, but it doesn't change the fact that giving a great knife to a crap chef won't make the food better, and giving a cheap knife to a good chef still results in great food, just a bit slower. But you're not going to hand a good chef a different knife and have them say "Well crap, guess I need to go back to culinary school and start all over". The language is the knife. Learn to be a good chef. Don't learn to use one particular knife well.

If your career takes you toward data analysis and data science then knowing R is a good thing. I think checking out https://automatetheboringstuff.com can get you through the basics (consider buying the book if you like what you see). After that I think further learning depends on what you want to do.
If you are dealing with small amount of data then python/pandas will be more than enough and is actually the best choice out there. Data engineering tasks start when you start dealing with data you can't fit in RAM. Then you have to figure out what is the best possible way to deal with it given the resources you have. 
Kinda neat. Now you can check out askreddit while driving.
I'd imagine they'd have the same "disable all programs" testing-mode that other models do.

Very cool man
They do? Wow, that didn't exist back when I was in school. 
Sometimes they force you to clear all memory in your calculator. I think even a made a dummy Gui to go through sequences and windows. But that doesn't do anything. 
Python 3 works with Unicode rather than ASCII strings. ASCII is a tiny subset of Unicode which is unsuitable for representing natural language text in any of the world's languages, with the sole exception of English. That said, `ord()` and `chr()` work essentially as others have said over all the range of Unicode.
Do you have a link outside of reddit cause it’s.m not working
Your string formatting is kinda inconsistent and not the best. You used string concatenation, which isn't the the best way to build strings. You should either use .format() or f-strings, not available before 3.6, for everything. They're faster, cleaner, and easier to read than string concatenation. I've linked two modifications of your code: one using .format() and another using f-strings. [.format\(\) version](https://pastebin.com/cKrmU6tT) [f-string version](https://pastebin.com/PJR83vAN) Also the end="" is unnecessary in print() and it breaks sys.stdout.write(). 
Don't worry too much, this is pretty old (2008). Also: "Algorithm is a recipe how to cook a program" -- WTF does that even mean?
This is going to sound like a dumb/off-topic question, but how do you modify the terminal theme/colors in VS Code to look like that? I have tried to find a theme and would think that the available themes would have an impact on the terminals regular bland single color but they do not. I want the colors to be similar to how you would theme the editor. For example the terminal theme colors in this video: [https://realpython.com/lessons/the-get-request/](https://realpython.com/lessons/the-get-request/) 
Really nice curl I wget it (i'm Sorry).
Yeah, the new ones have a "test mode" with an LED or something, too. Didn't when I was in school, like you, but I read about the test-mode a while back.
You rock! I recently bought my first Arduino kit, then discovered Python... now I can combine the two!
Can you send me the screenshot of the error?
Think again. Why would you *not* use an sqlite database?
For a simple GUI like this you don't need much performance.
Github repo?
PMed it 
Ok, I get the idea, but in which situations it can be useful? 😀
Yes, you're an idiot for investing time to learn a tool, and it's impossible to learn other tools. You should be ashamed.

Use a while loop. Ex: goodAnswer = false while( not goodAnswer): answer = input(.....) if(answer == « A »): print(« Correct ») goodAnswer = true else: print(« incorrect »)
I did that as well, but still failed the test :(
Dm me plz 
Solid choice of game. First, you should standardize the print statement for easier reading. `print('='*25)`will do what you looking for and not clutter up your code. Second, all the incorrect answers reply with the same thing, so consolidate them into `if answer1 == "A": print('Correct\n', '=' * 25)` `else: print ('Incorrect, Try Again \n', '=' * 25)` You really should wrap this in a function so that you can more eaily expand it later. Something like `def questionOne (correctAnswer, optionA, optionB,optionC,optionD,question):` but to just answer the question print("Welcome to the quiz about Rainbow Six Siege") time.sleep(2.3) print('='*25) print ("Please enter The answer in capitals") print('='*25) time.sleep(1) options1 = ("A = GIGN , B = Spetsnaz, C = SAS, D = FBI SWAT") print (options1) while True: answer1 = input("What group is Twitch from? ") print("Loading...") time.sleep(1.5) if answer1 == "A": print('Correct\n', '=' * 25) break else: print ('Incorrect, Try Again \n', '=' * 25) 
weird flex, but ok. 
did not know this existed. thanks!
As someone that would use command line 100% of the time of it were possible, curses is something I’ve always wanted to learn. Thanks for making these.
R is much better for certain tasks than python, is just python can do too many different tasks. for example, R kills python on data frame manipulation.
Nice and it actually prints percentage. love it
&gt; But Rust is much more pleasant to write and sometimes it feels like I am actually writing a python code. As someone who is about to dive in to Rust from mostly-Python this is good to hear.

Cheers! Just keep in mind that MicroPython doesn't work on every micro-controller. Like it won't work on UNO's or NANOs etc... as they are just too small, too slow and don't have enough ram. You'll want something with an STM32, ESP8266 or ESP32 to be able to use MicroPython.

A till count calculator (command line of course). I was working in a shop with no calculator and no computer, so I wrote a script on my laptop which prompted me for the amount in $100 notes, then $50s, $20s etc all the way down. If I entered a value that didn't make sense (e.g. $50 worth of $20 notes), it would inform me that I'd made a mistake and prompt for that denomination again. Then it prompted for card transaction totals, petty cash etc, then deducted the float to give the total takings. Pretty boring, but I was super psyched to get something working that actually made my life a little easier :)
It is.
Very cool!

Looks great! I'll keep an eye on your channel. Only last week, I was dismayed at the lack of blogs and tutorials for MicroPython, and thought of starting my own. 
Nice, I haven't checked in quote a lot of time, but has that issue with pygame consuming 100% of a course core been fixed? I am looking forward to do something with it this year.
That depends on the type of data and how you plan to use it. You could write to a text or binary file. If text, maybe CSV, XML, JSON format? You could even have a local file-based database like SQLLite: https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/sqlite3.html . It really depends 
Thank you! What kind of an OS do you think the doorbell runs? Having to carry out lots of image processing and several parallel processes, shouldn't it have a miniature version of Linux amyway?
Any idea what type of OS is installed on the doorbell?
It will be bools, text, and ints. All I need to do is pull them and stire them into varibles.
Take a look at JSON then: https://realpython.com/python-json/

Are you familiar with what a deque is? It is a container - it holds references to other objects. It is basically like a list, but a kind of list that is designed in a way that is quick to add, access, and remove items from either end, but slow to do operations in the middle. It has methods such as `append` and `pop` that modify what references it holds. Because its state (the list of objects it references) can be modified in-place without making a new deque (through those `append` and `pop` methods), it is mutable.
That's great last year I was trying to implement an optimization algorithm, too speed it up even more I wanted to memoize some costly operations, this could've been useful.
All depends; if to use for yourself, pickle the python objects. If to share with someone else, JSON. If arrays of integers, floats, etc. in a table format, HDF5 (h5py) or Pandas
Function and method are used interchangably sometimes. I personally consider a method to be a function which is specifically operating on an object.
I would assume because of performance and memory issues, but I am no expert.
May I know what site?
Who actually buys these things still? And why?
Let's say you're building some Lego thing. You need a specific piece from a specific set, so you go grab it out of its own box without touching anything else. What if, instead of that process, we just dumped each and every one of your different sets out onto the floor? Make sure they're all on top of each other, too. Now it takes you forever to find a particular piece, and you can't tell which Lego sets any of the identical pieces belong to. Not desirable, I'd say.
Thanks, that'll work.

Heard about it today, next time I'll post using asciinema!
For batch geo lookups I’ve used this before and it works well : https://github.com/mitmedialab/CLIFF I use the vagrant build script or docker image to get going quickly..
If it makes any difference he's using PowerShell for his terminal. I'm not sure if it does that color theme automatically or not.
I don't know whether there is such a tool. But in the end it's a little harder than your approach: don't forget all *imported* modules! If they are written in C, then it will even harder... Btw: Checking if a file exists, does not prohibit a File not found exception! It is a classic example for a [check-then-act](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13051266/race-conditions-check-then-act-and-read-modify-write) situation. Better way would be to handle the exception *explicitly*. 
I don't really need it for what i'm gonna do. It's just gonna be a client you are able to send emails from, maybe something more but that's all I have planned.
You're concerned about namespaces. Specifically, why have more than one? There are a lot of modules in the standard library. There are a lot of functions, classes and variables in each module. Any given project may have dozens or even hundreds of 3rd party library dependencies. Each one of them may have multiple packages, each of which may have multiple modules, each of which may have many functions, classes and variables. If every importable object was in your global namespace all the time, you'd quickly run out of names (because you wouldn't be able to duplicate them), and it would be awkward to find things. Imagine if every file on your computer was in a single folder! Instead, we keep different files grouped together by their usage, their context, and so on: that is what we do when we group classes, functions and variables into modules and packages. You want to be able to `from random import random`, because how else would you know that you're using `random.random` instead of, say, `numpy.random.random`? Sane IDEs like PyCharm will help you out with imports: type what you want, press a button, and it will suggest where you can import that from and let you add that import statement automatically.
What do you think mutability means? Have you tried mutating a deque? What happens when you do?

I'm quite experienced with Python (CPython and PYPY, but not MicroPython), but am new to Arduino. Are there limitations I should be aware of using MicroPython with Arduino?
Pretty sure every calculus student does... because it's essentially required for some algos and makes life 1000x easier on homework for double checking.

I can only guess but they may be using a RTOS (real time OS). There's FreeRTOS to get you started. Also check out OpenMV.io for fast prototyping of your image processing on bare metal using python. Using an RTOS and a decent microcontroller you can squeeze out quiet some performance. If you want to develop on a higher level of abstraction using multithreading/multiprocessing a lightweight linux will suit well. Depending on what else there is in the doorbell system, the actual processing of the image may happen on a backend server or on a local "master device" instead of the doorbell hardware itself. So the doorbell only sends the image data to be processed somewhere else.

Very nice!
Might get more help in something like r/statistics, this sub is mostly purely mechanical Python.
I mean, the 83 series has always been programmable, in either TI-BASIC or Z80 assembly (or compiling to it via e.g. SDCC).

Only fundamental objects are built in (require no import). For example `dict` and `len` and `print`. We just don't use `random` or `json` or `os` as much as we use `list`. These are lower-level object types that are used to build up more complex, specialized objects, including `random`. And yes, for namespacing as well. Don't underestimate the naming problem in CS. Scoping matters.
Stuff like this is an easy way to get certain sites to block whatever IP you're running the script from. I've seen it happen with google and stack overflow. One was some guy trying to hammer ads, the other guy was trying to make his stack overflow post more visible. Google greylisted us. We had to contact stack overflow.
There is a bit that is different, mainly to ensure it can run on constrained systems with considerably less memory and grunt than even an early 2000's computer...

Post the entire error message, but most likely yes. Why are you using 3.8, anyway? It's alpha quality software, and judging by the fact that you're asking these kinds of questions, you're not the target audience for it.

Here's the code paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12180 Context: I didn't write this, but on April Fools a lot of astronomers post "joke" articles to arXiv, the default free &amp; open access paper repository. Usually these are quite high-effort jokes that are often actually quite scientifically accurate. In this case, someone is making fun of the habit of astronomers of coming up with ludicrously contrived acronyms, by creating a Python script to arbitrarily generate such acronyms.

I use godot (a game engine) to create web pages. I create visuals and some scripts in the engine editor, and then I export the project to html5. The Scripts are mainly used to define the behaviors of some buttons and most importantly to store some data in some .txt files. My problem is that godot stores all scripts and .txt files in a .pck and I need to retrieve the .txt for another application.
Then you might want to look into Godot's source code or documentation and see if there are any specifications or libraries for dealing with that format.

I have to get this straight: you've got a course with an assessment that involves manipulating LEDs with Python, you're not interested in doing the work and thought you'd see if anyone here would do your assignment for you? Hilarious.
Pretty much yeah
I think the point of Python is that it is a scripting language, its easy to read and fast to write. Its not meant to be used for big programs that will be pushed to production IMO
If you are a beginner then what you made is absolutely awesome... keep it up... good work 😁
I doubt there's any OS. I'd guess it's just programned directly. If there is one it's probably some kind of linux
Thank you. I am a beginner and I have a bad habit that I don't learn unless I teach someone. LOL. Bear with me. :)
The dude who replied to you is a bot, check his comments. He’s annoying as hell.
First of all it's a fun project from which you can learn a lot of new stuff... I am not sure that is you want to control physical led matrix (8x8) so I will give some ideas for your project based on what I understood from the requirements. First: You need a GUI for the user to set the light colour value and the location of the LED Second: If you want to control a physical LED matrix (8x8) then you will have to find a way to use a micro controller (like Arduino Uno) through python and give the values from the GUI to micro controller and do the job Third: As an additional feature you can make A GUI with 3d structure of the matrix and light the LED based on which led that user is selecting (using something like blender)

At my school they only did a RAM Clear. So you just moved your precious programs to Archive and it was all fine. I wasn’t even trying to cheat on a test, but I put many and many hours into programming games for that thing. Would’ve sucked if that was lost.

It's most likely just a zip file in disguise. I'd try to open it as a zip file first. If that does not work, read the first few bytes and see if the file starts with an ASCII string, then google for it. Most file formats are identifiable by a short marker at the beginning of the file. If it looks completely random (no readable letters at the start, no patterns) it's most likely compressed with raw deflate (missing the gzip header). Or, if you are unlucky, it's encrypted. The key is probably hard-coded somewhere in the game engines source code, and was just added to make extracting assets hard for the average user. It's possible to circumvent, but annoying. &amp;#x200B; \*tl;dr:\* Look at the data first, then the source code. Most data formats are easy to identify and recognize by the first few bytes.

Well, you can check repository. And look which libraries he used and research these. I think it would be a good start point.

What's your reason for learning a new language? If you want to understand computers and programming better I recommend learning C. If you want to contribute to a specific project I recommend learning that project's language. If you want a job.. Well that depends on what kind of job you're looking for..
Follow the link to the page, and scroll down. They have Pokemon on a TI-83 calculator.
The project isn't the chatbot instead, it's the research related to what it should do, etc. I ended up with about 60 pages of writing, but had to hire someone to follow my design plan for the final product in the end, due to time issues.

I’m definitely going to be trying this with a few of my favorite movies. Thanks for this!
I'm pretty sure that class is for unparameterized distributions, where you know the bandwidth but not the variance, etc. [I think you should use the rv_continuous method instead](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.rv_continuous.html#scipy.stats.rv_continuous)
Once you understand what programming is about, you are ready for language 2. You know what variables, loops, functions and conditionals are, now you just need to learn how to "say" that in Go. You'll probably be writing your first app within a couple days.

This is my first blog post. feedback is welcomed. I wont spam this sub with every blog post just wanted to put out my first of many. \-Cheers
What.
Thanks for sharing. Very cool.
I thought I attached it, but it's a basketball , american football, tennis ball and a pool ball. I'm struggling with coding them in general using turtle. 
I'm not even joking, I would prefer a GOTO statement (in all caps even!) to a "break &lt;n&gt;". Counting loop levels is going to be confusing and fragile and amounts to a GOTO "end-of-loop-label" anyway.
Can't you just put it in a separate function and return?
Try \`found = any(f(y) for x in X for y in Y(x))\`
Wouldn't you have to sudo something like that?

&gt; My expectation that the feature will be abused more than it will be used right This is also my experience, with beginners specifically. Anyone with a C++ background can tell you that, while *occasionally* useful, it’s usually just code smell. (I mention C++ specifically because it can *add* clarity in C for things like error cleanup, which you’d use RAII for in C++)
Those aren't incompatible, and this very website is built on python
If you r talking about other things python can do .. anything u can think of .. game dev .. desktop dev .. data analysis .. u can sell your customers data analysis tools with web dev .. or maybe u mean automating tasks in your life which python can do pretty well .. i'm sorry if i'm not helping ur question is really vague :( 
I think I see where you're headed. Does any() short-circuit evaluation of a generator expression when it hits a true value?
If you want to use a guassian window you can check the scipy.signal.get_window and specify the variance and length
Oh no, they figured it out! How did it happen?
 def search(X, Y, f): for x in X: for y in Y(x): if f(y): return True return False
Whoa cool! Gonna try this after class
Would this more imperative style suit the OP more? (I prefer the one-liner to the 8-liner!) As your output, are you after the first value that matches, or just a True or False if there is a match? `found = False` `for xy in (y for x in X for y in Y(x)):` `found = True if f(xy) else False` `if found: break`
Of course clarity should always be the guiding principle. "break 2" would remove 4 lines from the example above. You think it less readable like that? &amp;#x200B;
You know there is an [else clause](https://medium.com/@s16h/the-forgotten-optional-else-in-python-loops-90d9c465c830) in "for" loop specifically for that case, right?
Yeah you can shoehorn anything into functional idiom. It works nicely because the example is concise.
Sure, and if there are a few more objects and variables involved, you just make a function with 7 variables. &amp;#x200B;

&gt; for index, friend in enumerate(friends): Will give you every element of the list (friends) with its numerical index within the list starting at zero. so in your 1st Iteration you will get: 0, 'friend1' 2nd Iteration: 1, 'friend2' and so on. &amp;#x200B; &gt; str(index+1) Will return the String representation of the numeridcal index added by one.
Write your [front-end](https://www.transcrypt.org/) code in a language that isn't an abomination. (caveat, given today's date i literally trust nothing I see on the internet, I'm not sure this is real, but it might be.)
By the way, enumerate has a `start` argument : friends = ['friend1', 'friend2', 'friend3', 'friend4'] print('\n'+'This is totally not the order of my friends:\n') for index, friend in enumerate(friends, start=1): print('Place: '+ str(index) + ' ' + friend.title())
Right, because the +1 raises the first number from a '0' to a '1'. Cool, thank you very much. I actually wanted to write more questions but I managed to understand it :)
Wow, that's cool! So I don't have to tell it to add 1 to the index afterwards! Thanks!

If you're interested in web development in any capacity Javascript would be the obvious choice. It seems like you have the fundamentals down so you shouldn't get overwhelmed by another language. I've been coding for a few years and I'm constantly going back and forth between learning more and more Python and more Javascript. I find that working in more than one language helps me be more aware of abstract principles rather than focusing on language specific implementations. That said, just go for it. Try out languages and use whichever one you like, as long as it's not php.
Does that error happen if u use a cobra environment instead?

First set a simplr objective. Research subjects like machine learning, GUI designing, Software Programming, Video Processing, Server systems etc. And then find the best one that suits your desires. After you set your simplest objective like "I will br capable of creating machine learning algorithms those are excellent on one task." Begin your journey. The most important thing is to not give up on that specific subject and start on an other subject. After you complete your first task find another applications that will enhance your first achievement. Be careful doing completely different things will be unefficient as they are not making you professional on a subject rather making you capable of doing completely unrelated tasks a little bit seniorly. This is an unefficient way of learning and you can't see any programmer that took this path.
No. In Java, methods must declare which exceptions they can throw. That information is used by the IDE to detect which exceptions are unhandled. In Python, that information is missing.
I would recommend ordering K&amp;R on Amazon or borrowing it at a library (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language) and installing Ubuntu if you haven't already. Then start programming. Start with basic tutorials, implement some algorithms and work your way up to memory management, bitwise operators, socket programming and system calls. C is a very simple language but it can also be very challenging because it exposes the hardware and operating system with very little abstraction. Valgrind is a great tool for debugging memory leaks. Learn to love it.
**The C Programming Language** The C Programming Language (sometimes termed K&amp;R, after its authors' initials) is a computer programming book written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, the latter of whom originally designed and implemented the language, as well as co-designed the Unix operating system with which development of the language was closely intertwined. The book was central to the development and popularization of the C programming language and is still widely read and used today. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

I'm going to try it on a few of my favorite Linux ISOs.
Python is clean partly because it does *not* adopt the "if you don't like it, don't use it" approach to language design. "There's only one obvious way to do it" is one of python s guiding principles because it means that python code written by *anybody* will look more-or-less consistent. For `break [n]` specifically, the situations where it would be easier to read than any existing alternatives are so rare that I seriously can't think of any. If you have 2 nested for loops, one of the many alternative suggestions in this thread could be better. If you have more than 2 nested for loops, you are already in "there must be a better way" territory.
An interesting thing you can do with natural language processing is “vectorize a sentence”. And basically, you can categorize vectors in similar directions to the same “intent” and you can handle the response from there. This might be a bit beyond the scope of your game. Of course you could always just pattern match for a few keywords and respond from there, but it won’t always make sense.
The use of any() here is way shorter and, arguably, clearer than the example you posted with nested loops and breaks. How is that a shoehorn if it's an improvement?
Thank you :) 
Thank you :)
Python 5???! I tought the newest was 3.7
It’s almost as though it’s April fools day huh
Trying to retrofit asyncio onto some slow, synchronous code...
I was typing a reply, but you basically covered everything. Any situation where `break [n]` would be useful is because that section of code is just bad. Deeply nested loops are usually a code smell. &amp;#x200B; Instead of adding useless crap that will clutter Python just to make poorly written code slightly better, the better option is to rewrite that code to smell a little less and not need something like `break [n]` in the first place. Like you said, not putting in "if you don't like it, don't use it" garbage is why Python is clean in the first place. There really ought to only be one right way to do something.
In a real life example there may be some additional function calls or initialization inside the loop, and your solution would probably look a lot hairier. But I'll give your example a try next time I run into this problem, and see what happens, so thanks for that.
That's hilarious. I think I know a fix for that (it has to do with latex floats). I will push a new release when I have time later this week.
If the nesting gets truly deep, the standard solution is to move it to a small function and then `return True` when the match is found, or `return False` at the end.
&gt; Of course, having said all that, what I'd do instead is &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; v = 1234 &gt; &gt; s = "{:^11}|".format(v).replace(" ", "-") I've never seen that type of formatting before. Would you mind breaking it down? or pointing me at some information to read about it?
I am making a game. I need to store all the info about the users computer (name, password, etc), also money amount, and a lot more.
Thanks, I looked into it and yea...seems a little complex for what I wanna do. I think making paterns for a few key words would be easier to implement (even if as you said it is not always going to make sense)

FWIW, I think that language hopping is one of the biggest mistakes that beginners make. (I know this in part because I was guilty of it.) It's more valuable to continue your education by building more ambitious things that require solutions to problems you haven't faced yet. Eventually you will reach a point where some other language is better suited for what you're trying to do, and then it will make sense to learn that other language. But until then you're likely better off going deeper into Python. That said, if your ultimate goal is to do something that Python isn't good at (iOS/Android, web front ends, low-level systems programming, game development) you might as well move along to something more appropriate now.

Man! I was thinking, I need to start studying Python 4 then.
Very nice! I especially like the cover picture you chose. This is already perfect as a piece of wall art :) 
I think this is the other way around. You need to find something that gives you a competitive advantage first. And then build your skill set around this decision. What are you passionate about? If you want to make games for android, python should not be your first choice, but if you want to make a site like reddit, then python is quite good for it. Then you can learn about web frameworks, decide which one you want to use, etc. Do you have an internal knowledge of some money-making business that can be improved? What can you do better than some reasonably talented guy sitting 8 thousand miles away from you? And always think first about how are you going to sell it. If you are not planning to work for a company, how are you going to sell your machine learning skills? 
If you json it, everyone can cheat like mad by editing it in notepad, and you may feel it devalues your game, or the users might be trivially tempted and play less. However it may encourage modding. Of course Python isn't particularly hard to hack, but unless you want to support modding I would not use a human-readable save.
I dont know what that library does but yes it works with it. ```py import fuckit rr = fuckit('rustyreturn') rlr = rr.rlr @rlr def add(x, y): x + y assert add(2, 3) == 5 ```

I just finished up my first actual Python app that I made from scratch. It's a super simple calculator for deducting federal income tax from your gross income determined by your filing status e.g. single, married/jointly, married/separately, head of household.

You should start with Harvard's CS50 class (free online). Some things will feel redundant at first but it accelerates quickly and you'll definitely get something out of it once you dive into C.
What does "remove 4 lines" even mean? You are going to have to define that. When you do, it'll be something like "jumping to spot $X in the code". In other words, you are going to define "break" in terms of a "goto". Why not just implement "goto" then?
 found = False for x in X: for y in Y(x): if f(y): found = True break if found: break becomes for x in X: for y in Y(x): if f(y): break 2 Which is four lines less and removes a bunch of dumb clutter.
If you only have the names of companies, then no, there's no way to have relationships created between them. You'll have to look for an external source that has this relationship data available for you to query. Or, you do the hard work yourself, and set up all the relationships (though this defeats the goal of using python to save time). However you get the relationships, then it's easy: just use the relationships. The hard part will be finding suitable sources to make the relationships between company names, since as I'm assuming they're just strings, they have no inherent relationship. Asking on /r/learnpython will net you more advice, as the place to ask this sort of question

I'm in the same boat but haven't been actively looking for awhile now since it's so difficult to make a change. Most of the time the recruiters/screeners will automatically filter you if you don't have X years of Python experience. Recruiters typically place zero value on experience with other programming languages. Also something you didn't mention is taking a "junior level" Python job would likely mean a pay cut of $30k+ since you're a very experienced developer at this point. I've decided to stick it out in my current job while I pursue a Masters degree that my company will pay \~90% of the cost of to open up more opportunities in a few years. The only other strategy I know that can work is moving to a different department/team/project within your company.
This is very cool but, what would be the real-world use case for this?
There are none, it is just a proof of how dynamic python are. 
I like how you completely yoinked the quotes.json from my [Thanos API](https://github.com/sggts04/thanosapi) but hey it was open source so you're free to do anything with it :)
 found = False for x in X: moo(x) for y in Y(x): if f(y): found = True break if found: break How would you incorporate the call to moo into that double list comprehension? &amp;#x200B;
Congrats on making a thing! &amp;#x200B; But please no. I think this practice is a code smell, but for language design. Powershell (5.x and prior) takes this one step further and statements that return anything are added to the "return stack", which makes debugging a pain.

**Summary:** Want to share a fully interactive Jupyter Notebook, without requiring the recipient to install anything? Or just want to try out Jupyter yourself? This post compares six free "hosted notebook" services in-depth. &amp;#x200B; **Here are the services I compared:** 1. Binder 2. Kaggle Kernels 3. Google Colaboratory (Colab) 4. Microsoft Azure Notebooks 5. CoCalc 6. Datalore &amp;#x200B; **All of these services have the following characteristics:** * They don't require you to install anything on your local machine. * They are completely free (or they have a free plan). * They give you access to the Jupyter Notebook environment (or a Jupyter-like environment). * They allow you to import and export notebooks using the standard .ipynb file format. * They support the Python language (and most support other languages as well). &amp;#x200B; **If you just want a quick summary, check out the** [**comparison table**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12thaaXg1Idr3iWST8QyASNDs08sjdPd6m9mbCGtHFn0/edit?usp=sharing)**.** &amp;#x200B; Questions/comments?

Thank you
Can you please elaborate your use case on this please ?
Don't say that you are a "Perl developer". You've been coding for 15 years; while the may take a while to get truly expert in, you should be able to pick up medium to difficult tasks in Python right away. The hard part of coding isn't the syntax; it's having a sense of what's the right way architecturally and algorithmically to solve the problem. Just say that you're a senior developer. Companies who actually want senior developers will know that you'll be productive in the language they're using by the time you're done onboarding anyway. Companies who actually want minimum-cost developers will turn you away for any reason they can, and "lack of experience" is an easier reject than "you expect too much salary."

Yeah I completely get the limitations that's what I hate too. But how do you make more complex things like sprites? Individually make each frame or is there some special software to help?
I made [my own tool](https://cmlsc.itch.io/px-editor) for that.

This is not true for all exception types. There are *checked*exceptions, that must be handled or *explicitly* passed up the call chain until there are handled (or finally make the program stop) and *unchecked* exceptions. The latter are far better to deal with, as they don't clutter your interfaces.

You could write a loggedException class that reports what happened, and where, with what parameters and have all exceptions raise the loggedException. Then you don't have to fuss with code analysis tools

The programming language has little to do with it. Find out what society really need — what the current zeitgeist is and provided solutions for that. The devil is in the details so you will definitely need to be knowledgeable in your field. But, don't get "married" to any development stack. I listen and pay attention to many expert programmers (Linus Torvalds, Scott Guthrie , Richard Brodi, scott hanselman), but programmers are bad business people, we just say the wrong thing to the wrong people. It was more watching Elon Musk, Ian Khan, Steve Jobs and Ted Talks that really helped me explain my product to people and convince them to buy it.

I've used vim countless times but still had a brain fart and had to ask an employee today. Maybe that's why I usually use nano. 
A pi cant directly drive a BLDC motor. It would control an external driver circuit like you might find on a EasyDriver or other motor driver circuit/board
It looks like there's definitely some improvements that could be made to your algorithm here. You notice how a lot of flat color areas are just the same scene copied and pasted to make one big flat area with the same scene? [You might want to read on dithering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering). Look at the image of the cat with no dithering. This will probably balance it out more and make the appearance of more detail and more colors without using more scenes. You having limited number of scenes is kind of like reducing it to a smaller palette and I believe you could use very similar tricks here.
Please tell me, how does it feel to suck that hard? Does it hurt?
A little, but I'm pretty numb to it at this point. 
Vim is awesome!

Yes. What does :qw! mean? 
Figure 9 really captures the imagination.
"q" is the command to quit, and "w" is the command to write (save) the file. This just does both. The "!" tells it to ignore warnings, for example if the file is write-protected it will override that (assuming user has permissions) or if the user doesn't have write permission, it will quit anyway without saving.
Python 5? Where is 4?
I'm having some issues reproducing. I believe I know that cause, but LaTeX will not reliably reproduce the error. Would you wish to open an issue on my repo? It'd help if you could send me the output from ```Jupyter notebook --to latex notebook.ipynb```.

I wrote this today because of the xkcd: https://repl.it/repls/QuintessentialJoyousClass The hardest part was figuring out this: rounds_range = range(1, len(completed)+1) rounds = {r: completed[len(rounds_range)-r] for r in rounds_range} Which converts the weird inversely-appended stack-like structure he was using in the API to a rounds dict that makes sense.
Just use idiomatic Python: use the built-in sort() / sorted() instead of reverting to very bad and slow algorithms.
I accidentally hit some other key and now its only typing “:qw!” into my init.el file overwriting the other text that was already in there.

These are two examples from a piecweise linear system. The domain is the unit cube with three regions of equal volume separated by one diagonal. On the left is an oscillator solution for a particular parameter value that controls how much the three regions are shifted relative to each other. On the right is a different parameter value that shifts the three regions closer so that the domain looks more like a cube, and takes the oscillator much closer to the saddle points denoted by three circles in the corners. In the limit as the regions become more cube-like, the period diverges to infinity. &amp;#x200B; Paper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.03503.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.03503.pdf) Code: [https://github.com/youngmp/pwl\_iprc](https://github.com/youngmp/pwl_iprc)

Vim is a text editor used for coding. It was extremely popular in the early days of computing along with it's competitor, emacs. Vim does have a graphical user interface like VS Code or XCode. It is entirely displayed through the terminal and there is a very expressive (and complicated) set of key commands to control it. Today most people use other IDEs because having a GUI is nice and a lot less of a learning curve.
You make a good point. We build a lot of machinery around "projects" and "professional." If that doesn't fit into "small script tasks", that's ok IMO. OTOH some value learning one set of shortcuts, or the visual debugger/tester/VCS, or other aspects.

You could probably do it with VTK pretty easily. It's just a texture on a sphere. VTK handles large 3D models far, far better than matplotlib. We're talking 3D models of 200,000 elements is easily doable in VTK, but matplotlib kinda dies past 1000. Here's the C++ version with the earth (the C++ API is almost identical to the Python API). [https://vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Cxx/Texture/TexturedSphere](https://vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Cxx/Texture/TexturedSphere) &amp;#x200B; and a python version without the earth [https://lorensen.github.io/VTKExamples/site/Python/Visualization/SphereTexture/](https://lorensen.github.io/VTKExamples/site/Python/Visualization/SphereTexture/) &amp;#x200B; shouldn't be too bad.
More like it's been around longer than anything else you use (for the most part) and is such a joke that I can't understand how anyone can't exit it after their first time experiencing it. Elsewise, yes - you are the dumb.
Not unrelated as plenty of people us vscode as their IDE 
I am going to try my best to understand this. Even if I don't, I graciously appreciate new information!
There is gvim. I use it (software engineer) for editing text that takes 1 simple regex as oppose to 7 thousand clicks in Eclispe. Remember, even at init 3, vi is always available btw `:x` or `:q!` or `:wq`
For our purposes, and the project we use it for, it's more than ready. We only have one dependency -- requests -- and it's bundled in the executable in our case. We have another project with many dependencies and for that we went with cx_Freeze which of course doesn't result in a single executable so must be installed altogether.
Nooooooooooo

Everyone should learn Python. EVERYONE.
Big fan of Huey, thanks for all the work!
Python for the most part has very low difficulty. Excel is certainly good to know, and maybe some VB for office, but visual basic is not going to be used outside office at all any more, save for legacy systems. If you want to do development, do python. It's one of the top languages being used, and there's a very active community (especially /r/learnpython which is meant for learning, this is for news, etc) 
How do we learn different kinds of sorting algorithms then?
This looks lovely! I have no idea what it is! In laymen terms what am I looking at? Thanks! 
Maybe it'll help to talk about the biological system that motivated this model. Aplysia Californica is a sea slug with a very robust feeding mechanism (you should look up some videos. Their odontophores look... provocative). There are three stages in feeding: protraction (where the "mouth" extends), grasping (where the "mouth" grasps seaweed), and retraction (where the "mouth" pulls the seaweed back). When there is a lot of sensory feedback, the cycle is very smooth, and that's what's represented on the left. The oscillating solution has a more or less constant velocity. When there is lack of sensory feedback (from blocking the nerves chemically, for example), the feeding mechanism tends to dwell much more at each of these stages (imagine that you have to grasp something while your arm is asleep. You would probably try to grab onto it really hard to make sure you have a good grip). This case is shown on the right. The oscillating solution dwells at the three corners for much longer (it's not really shown clearly in this plot).
The best I've done is scatter plots and some stacked bar plots, with default colours.
It kinda reminds me of a hysteresis loop for some reason. 
[Micro](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro) might be up your alley!
I’m actually surprised that I understood what you said there! Gave me a different perspective at what I was looking at. 
I would definitely learn Excel, but visual basic is useless unless ur writing macros or something for Excel. Learn python.
Thanks, will look into it. 
This was supposed to be just a prototype, but since so many people like it, I have put it under MIT license. I will make a list in the readme of possible improvements and tweaks which can be done to improve this. Feel free to make pull requests :)
This is awesome. Any plan for integrating with \`async\`-\`await\` feature of python3?
It looks like the x axis isn't numbered in the same direction away from origin as the other two - what's the reason for that?
The view is angled/rotated such that the origin is farthest from the viewer. I had to do that because the z-order didn't work in 3D python plots and had to find the right angle that made it easy to plot each line in the right order. This view is also provides the best view of the solutions.
No support from the official maintainers, e.g. bugs won't be fixed. See https://pythonclock.org, [PEP 373](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/) , and [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4836375/end-of-support-for-python-2-7) question on SO.
If it's truly EOL then in theory security vulnerabilities will no longer be fixed. So that might be a concern to some people. And new operating systems and platforms might never get 2.7, if no one is working on it. In some cases I think EOL can have no impact, though, if you have a setup that works for you and you are happy with it, it should keep running indefinitely.
Newly-discovered bugs and security flaws won't be fixed by the PSF. CPython 2.7.16, a bugfix release made nearly a decade after the first alpha of 2.7, only came out a few weeks ago - there are still issues being found.
People write dissertations/theses in anything else?
Yes. Heretics do it in Word. I had to write the class for my postgrad latex format because so few people had even suggested LaTeX that they didn't have a default format. Welcome to the Faculty of Medicine I suppose.
In what ways/scenarios would you imagine that being particularly beneficial?
1/0
This is an image. There are many of them on the internet with varying _formats_. The format of this particular file is PNG. I can tell this because of my degree in Computer Science and because of some of the _pixels_. In most cases each _pixel_ is made up of 3 different color levels. One red, one green, and one blue colloquially known as Arrgeebee. In this particular case each _pixel_ also has an additional color called "alfa". This is _clear_ because the "alfa" color exhibits its domination over the other colors. 
oooooo yyeeeeeaaaaaa. i luv me some good black magicks. ipython autocall is nice if u havent checked it.
Hell my resume is in latex on a private git repo too just so that I can version it.
looks like one of the diagnals might be a bit off in _(a)_. They don't all meet up in the middle, unless that's intentional? Gonna post this anyway, but I think it was intentional as in your description you mention these graphs showing the relative shift between planes. If I'm not mistaken then that's what's being shown by that.
nop, but i'll look that.
There's absolutely no reason you can't know all of those things.
That is what I thought originally but now after learning it I use it on almost every big program I work on, it is good for file transfers and little things like that so something to tie the parts of my scripts together
I'm a bit of a noob on this topic, but what's the issue with Word? I produced a 200+ page report for my undergraduate project with Word. I didn't really have any major issues - and I'm pretty picky about formatting. I think the biggest issue I had is at one point I had to compile some writing from different members into the final report and one if them didn't use Word's cross reference functionality for tables and figures, but that was pretty easily fixable and was user error, not the fault of word. Is there something I'm missing? 
The most advanced versions of image have dickbutt in them.
fundamentally tough problem. A logfile is a serial thing, but multiprocessing is parallel. My hack was to create logs for each process that was running. Only log exceptions. Not pretty, but slowly but surely one can perfect code logic.
All images have an associated 'dickbutt number', which tracks the distance between any given image and it's dickbutt analogue.

Is the dickbutt number compressible, or gets lost when converted to buttpeg?
WAIT YOU GO TO CASE? I GO TO CASE!
Vim is a text editor that can be used to edit python files or sending a message to your girlfriend it's up to you how you use it.
Meanwhile in Perl, I can just use named loops. X: for my $x (@xs) { for my $y (Y($x)) { last X if f($y) } } No need to count arbitrary indentation levels, or even change the statement at all if I add an additional level of indentation. Each loop can be named, and then I can call `last NAME` or `next NAME` whenever I want. With that said, however... Whenever I use a named loop, it's typically a good sign that I need to refactor the logic. It comes in handy when I need to whip something up, and honestly I thought I had a few named loops still laying around... but I just searched my code base and I couldn't find any, so I must have factored them out.
If you are about to ask a "how do I do this in python" question, please try r/learnpython
Elixir also returns implicitly
You can also use Excel as a database. But you shouldn't. LaTeX is a phenomenal tool built for purpose for publishing large technical documents. Word has gotten better, but I've also seen it randomly crap out and not keep formatting consistent from page to page. I also quite like the ability to work on individual sections in separate files that can be put into different documents repeatedly (very useful for boilerplate sections in my industry where some parts are the same or extremely similar between proposals/documents). Along with incredible formatting and automation, during my Master's I actually had the output for confusion matrices, plots, etc all output the correct latex formatting along with titles, headings, links and values in latex that could just be imported wholesale into the thesis (I could have automated further, but cut and paste of the formatting was quick enough). The ability to rapidly and precisely change every heading or formatting option from a single file rather than having to check every page to make sure that every heading was consistently linked, etc. One keyword changes to adjust margins and page layouts (oneside, twoside, number of columns per page, etc). I was able in the space of about thirty seconds generate totally different page layouts for digital (even margins), single sided (hardcover thesis, left side larger margin), and double sided (soft cover marking thesis), each with different top of page layouts. So, sure you CAN use Word. But should you?
They actually mention that in the paper
Haha this is lovely
buttmaps are uncompressed
no, i am going through their docs now, but want to figure out what's happening with my implementation. any ideas?
Trying to extract text from resumes(pdf, docx, txt). The issue is, code doesnt work on resumes downloaded from internet, but extracts from files in my local machine. Trying to fix it. Hope i get some support in fixing... asking in communities

&gt; You can also use Excel as a database. But you shouldn't. I see this sentiment quite often but honestly Excel is an incredible tool and very accessible to the average computer user. Excel tables with data validation, pulled together using sumproducts and pivot tables, makes for a very easy to make, use and modify small scale database tool. I don't like it per say, but there's hardly anything out there really on par in terms of ease of use and implementation.

Hello It is an interesting presentation to be delivered. It is always good to present about something which you are good at and which is your everyday work. Well as you mentioned that the audience in front of which you are presenting does not have any concept about Python which is an advantage and also disadvantage for you. As per my suggestion i would like you to start with what is Python and you have to make some interesting way to defined python which will attract the audience and make him believe that Python is something else then the other Programming Language. Next you prepare some facts on the big Company which use Python as the major Programming language and also provide the major application of Python at the present. Give a glimpse on the Future scope of Python and the necessary for any Company to invest on Python and also share your thought on why the future generation needs to [Learn Python](http://www.cetpainfotech.com/technology/python-training). If you present all this in a beautiful way then i believe that you will get a positive result from your presentation. Thank You
I always generate it as .pdf and seems to work ok, but can be hit or miss. I think there might be some .docx generators too, but I can't attest to quality of any given one.
PDF also not recommended. Yeah if you never get a response you might not be making it through the ATS filter. Best advice I got was to use a PDF to text converter and examine the output. At first, so much looked bogus, words were mashed together, random ascii characters, or words split into many. From there I was able back track such that the PDF and text was reconciled. It's all ridiculous, but reddit helped me at least compete 
That's some advanced mathematics there, I am still trying to understand the title. Leave alone the code.

What happens is just that the PSF itself stops official support. No new official bug fixes or releases, though most likely league commercial companies that use Python 2 May continue to provide patches, it just won’t be through the official org or the current maintainers. Basically at some point supporting the legacy branch no longer makes sense as a use of limited resources, so those resources will stop being spent on it. This may also mean an eventual end to funding for things like PyPi bandwidth for legacy packages, removal of documentation for 2 from the official site, etc, but who knows how long any of that might take. The main impact is on anybody starting a new project. Nothing new should be written in 2, and frankly it’s been years since anything new should have been.
The old code I wrote for Python 2.3 still works assuming I can track down all the packages required, which is a big if. I need the right version of Visual Studio if I want to write some C++ code. It's just more of a challenge as time goes on, but ultimately, I can still do it. EOL is a big deal because for 10 years, I've been using Python 2.7. I've gotten tons of updates for packages like numpy, scipy, and matplotlib. It's not just bug fixes for those; it's new features too. I really couldn't care less about Python 2.7.7 vs. 2.7.16 (as long as I have at least 2.7.7). I care about everything else. It's not just EOL for Python; it's EOL for everything else.
Shouldn't matter for manually entered data though should it?
It really depends on what job you're in or looking at getting into. If it's a data role then from experience SQL / Excel are a must, VB / VBA is nice for automation but not essential, Python is non essential but preferable depending on the company, it also may help negotiate a better salary. Truth is in data roles, there's still a lot of companies out there who aren't using Python or R and you will become valuable if you can bring that skill to the team. Python is great because it's a well rounded programming language that has tons of applications, not just data analysis. It's also hugely popular, so you'll find that there's many people out there who may have already solved the problem you're trying to. I'd definitely recommend learning Python, but if it's a data role you're looking at, it'd be worth your time to become proficient in Excel as well. You can get away with learning the basics at first, but the advanced stuff like power pivot will save vast time in the long run.
You should try using the LaTeX backend for matplotlib! This way you can have every line of text processed by your LaTeX compiler and have even better plots for your papers!

I've seen a lot of recruitment agencies also insist on doc/docx, primarily so they can add their company logo / contact details. As far as I'm concerned, my CV is my design and my content, so PDF means nobody can dick with it. 
This comment having 69 upvotes just amplifies it's humour.
I always used matplotlibtotikz. Is there a better option than that?
To add to this. Docx can do everything that Tex can but more precise. The use of macros has changed my writing experience where I defined a commonly used expression once and just use it as a command in Tex. However writing Tex imo is just awful especially how it handles simple errors. The core idea behind Tex is that you focus on writing and separate it from styling. However the error handling makes me wanna throw my PC against the wall
We only touched on dickbutts in my studies, but I do know that the computability of n-ary dickbutts scales with a worst case run time of about O( n^d*b ) where d is the number of dicks and b is the number of butts. Normally the ratio of d:b is 1:1, but sometimes you get multiple dicks to a single butt. 
It's all well and good until someone decides that they want images in each of the row entries. Then the whole thing turns to shit
[You are gonna like this!](https://matplotlib.org/users/usetex.html)
I think that task is a single job that needs to be done sequentially by nature. So async-await does not help here
What do you mean by "link your script to the env"? You activate the virtual environment first, and then run your scripts. Also, /r/learnpython.
.. I don't think you know what a venv is. `venv/bin/python YOUR_SCRIPT.py`
So i activate the venv by "Source env/bin/activate" and then "Python home/pi/Desktop/Email/fil.py"? I see it works. What if i use CRON to schedule the script how do i run it in the Env when its automatic?
It can be a huge improvement when tasks have io nature. For example when you need to download some pages and then process them or process some data in the database. My case (I actually have it now): I'm making service that allows posting to social networks posts, it is done using aiohttp. So it is already async and I can't use blocking operations Sometimes users add a post to the calendar, sometimes want just press "Publish". In this case, I want to call something like: await publish_post(post_id) And be sure that it will be added to the queue and as soon as a worker is ready will post it to the social network. The second case, when a user authorizes using messenger I want to make little on-boarding and send some messages with instructions. But if the text is longer then I need to make some delays between messages. It can take a few seconds between each send. A worker will be busy during all sequence or I need to make workarounds. Async code is just: await post("Hello", user_id) await async_sleep(1) await post("Thank you for joining our service", user_id) &amp;#x200B;
I know what it is and how it works, I just didnt know how to trigger it, but K900\_ Told me. If you wanna help then you hopefully can tell me how to make it auto like with CRON &amp;#x200B;
I’m not sure if you’re just trying to nerdsnipe us into doing your homework for you...

... you obviously don't know how it works or what it is, especially since I handed you the answer in my initial response.
Then explain it to me cause i cant use "Venv/bin/python" to anything
No mores the pity. Like many academics with data analytics challenges at various scales i'm just trying to better understand what things do and whether they are useful to me. This may be much better for some of my distributed flight simulation challenges. What led to the name choice btw?
I can see that being a problem. What sort of approach would you recommend to someone to use instead? Considering we're on r/python, tkinter + sqlite or would it be better jumping into something like sqlalchemy and a server based database?
You could use a JavaScript timer to periodically call an AJAX GET to your server. This way, it happens automatically. Is PostgreSQL needed? Do you need to add that extra layer? I would try to get by with just Redis and its own persistence capabilities.
That’s completely untrue that it can only do high school math. It’s not Mathematica, but you’re not giving it nearly enough credit.
... you replace `venv` with the path to your virtual environment.
The easiest way is to use the full path to the Python interpreter in your virtualenv: `/home/user/path/to/env/bin/python /home/user/script.py`
Excel is the wrong tool for every job.
Ahmen.
hey, thanks for this. yeah actually, postgres is not needed at the moment, just thinking of how i could combine the two for best performace, because I may have millions of data to aggregate. 
A control system with three parameters? Like, this is a graphical visualization of the idea of "time-cost-quality" ?
For new programmers, I recommend this book: The Super Simple Programming Book https://www.amazon.com/dp/1718198450 It's short, straightforward, and easy to understand. You'll learn fundamental programming concepts and Python. The book assumes no prior programming experience. After working through the book, you'll be prepared to learn more advanced programming concepts. Highly recommended.
I actually turned around a solution for that spreadsheet in a day. We already had some legacy code that generated all of the data in Python, then it ran it through some transformations to dump it as an Excel file. Instead all I did was dump it out as Javascript that created a single JSON object with all of the data in it. I then made a quick index page that loaded in the script file that I output and used a common JSON datatable library to display the rows and images. Turns out HTML and Chrome handles large sets of images _really well_. Go figure. There's more that went into it to allow us to distribute updates and have it update with the correct data, but a lot of that was super straight forward. Users simply clicked on a batch script and the index page popped up in Chrome. We were then in a position to build a local webapp around it which we could eventually flip and serve remotely and users likely would never know (users in this case being other non-technical developers). Welcome to Tools. We were fairly adverse to doing lots of UI related things because honestly, we're not UI developers and that burns a _lot_ of time. Time that we could spend bolstering our crippled backend and making larger improvements to developer life that just didn't look as pretty.
Seriously. I learned FORTRAN 77 in 1.5 days. It’s just syntax. Oh, I need to use these weird continue statements and 6 character all caps, no underscore variable and function names. I also need to pass my output essentially into void functions called subroutines along with the dimensions. You’re now an expert.
What does python have to do with downloading a py file? Just download it. Also /r/learnpython 
I graduated from case in 2013 :) 
So you are telling me that rust returns the last expression? geee... what could possibly go wrong... 
I'm also learning some libraries related to my own projects in parallel, but I haven't added them to this learning map because I'm trying to keep it general, useful for whoever might be trying to become a Python expert. Anyone can use this learning map by duplicating it, and then removing the "checked" toggles from the TODO lists. Anyone can also get inspiration and just create his own learning map, and not just for Python.
Is hypothesis really needed? Doesn't pytest cover parametrization already? I am not very familiar with hypothesis, but I see there's some overlap.
If your machines are not web-facing, and you don't use many 3rd party libraries, you can carry on using version 2 and nothing bad will happen. On the other hand if you want updates and the ability to pull down some new lib from github, you're gonna have a bad time.
You're probably right, it's not really needed at such an early tier. For whoever wants to understand Hypothesis in less than 5 minutes: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smr9xFc-jns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smr9xFc-jns)

You can select whatever interpreter you want in pycharm. You can simply select the anaconda interpreter you use for spyder. 
Hmm. Isn't becoming an expert in single language rather limiting? As long as you know the basic and intermediate stuff, you can already accomplish pretty much anything given sufficient domain-knowledge which is not tied to a language. Instead of spending inordinate amount of time past the intermediate stuff, you could've branched out to other languages and thus made your toolbox that much bigger and more wanted in the industry. Just my thoughts.
Hi, MicroPython is alive and kicking. The new Pyboard D-series is out now. In case anyone wants to get their feet wet with MicroPython and the Pyboard (there is one available live over the internet - so no need to buy one if you just want to explore), here is a coupon for MAKERDEMY's "Introduction to MicroPython using the Pyboard" https://sso.teachable.com/secure/139484/checkout/1071557/introduction-to-micropython-using-the-pyboard?coupon_code=MICROPYTHONFANAAC
Everyone in the team loves tartiflette and I guess the team was hungry and cold when we were choosing the name :P
This learning map also has lots of SQL, BASH, CI/CD stuff, regex.
If I'm understanding your code correctly, you're enumerating all the possible assignments? Since this is a knapsack problem we can try to solve it with linear programming. In most cases you have to end up rounding since linear programming allows non-integer solutions and we have a binary problem here. However, the solution came out, which if fun. I posted my code [to an old blog of mine](https://phaethonprime.wordpress.com/2019/04/02/a-quick-knapsack-example/) since anon gists are no longer a thing.
I mean there's nothing wrong with Spyder but pycharm is definitely better
This x100 \^ Languages aren't that important (doesn't hurt to do it in the language you excel in). You'll want to apply to places that allow you to program in the language of your choice during your interview. I've gotten plenty of offers from places with no experience in the language.

What do you mean by python developer? Web developer with django/flask skills? In that case certainly not. But data sceince require strong mathematical background, which implies a decent knowledge of algorithms. And using python for DS/ML will give you as good knowledge of python syntax as any other application. So any development position that does not require the use of a specific library or framework should be quite approachable with DS background.
I'll be honest, I understood almost nothing of what you just said, but hot damn that's impressive. It's literally instant. Almost makes me sad the length of time I spent on this now 
I recommend posting specific examples of things you'd like Sympy to do that it doesn't, or doesn't do well, that other software does.
The venue where I work is now cashless and (finally) uses a cash register system instead of tokens. So I'm writing a script to combine the data from our production system and the cash register system to see when people are drinking what and which genre is the most profitable (for example, for our accountant I need this data to do some boring stuff and check if the right amount of money is on our bank account).
Eh, developer on its own is a meaningless term. You can develop algorithms, websites, mobile applications, desktop applications. Show me what you've built and that's what you are until you show me otherwise.
My definition of a python developer is someone who uses python to develop software. With basic knowledge of python as for knowing its syntax plus some ML libraries, it is not enough for a data scientist to be able to code software? The whole purpose of my interrogations is based on a statement where someone told me if you are a data scientist who is already familiar with python, than you are able to code software in python with easy, as if it was your area of specialization , which unfortunately i disagree with and that's why I needed more convincing arguments. 
to be more precise , software developer. 
Python is tech a data scientist can use. They should be orthogonal. But a data scientist can develop in python and be a kickass developer. Let’s get a mathematician in here and write a theorem 
Don't be sad! You're teaching yourself and learning along the way. That's excellent. Linear programming is its own field, and there are several libraries in Python (usually interfacing to fast compiled libraries) to accomplish the task. I like [this post](http://benalexkeen.com/linear-programming-with-python-and-pulp/) for explaining both what linear programming is and how to perform it in python. If you're into learning optimization, your problem here is also a great way to start teaching yourself Genetic Algorithms, which are very useful for discrete variable (binary or integer) problems, especially when the thing you're trying to optimize isn't as simple as minimum cost from an array of costs. Cheers!
What are the rules for the challenge? Pure python - no numpy etc? There is clearly some concurrency going on here.That laptop almost certainly has faster single threaded performance. It should be no faster, and probably slower, on the serverm, if single threaded.
Yes indeed. A while ago I made a script to change the extension for the invoices I need to send to an ocr-site to lowercase because they got a problem with capital extensions. Now I change the filename depending on the date, put it in a subfolder and send it to the ocr-site (I want a local copy so I don't just forward the mail to the ocr-site. Next step is to do some ocr myself but I'm afraid it will give me a lot of headache.
It was written in pure Python but there was no rule stopping it being written any other way. The code I wrote parallel processes up to 64 seeds at a time. Someone else just posted a code running in less than a second, literally gobsmacked by it
You have done something of great value to your company and it doesn't matter than a 1/day process takes 50 seconds. It might nbot be the best solution, but you aren't a professional software engineer and I think you've done more than adequately.
Thank you very much, I will read as much as I starting on your link. And thank you again for this very eye opening lesson.
Thank you, I guess you are right, 50 seconds, 1 second, it's nothing for a once a day task.
I am saying that I do not understand why it's faster on the 32 thread machine than on the 4 thread machine. edit: Never mind, I looked at your code and you have used processes, not threads. 
OK thanks, makes sense. After a bit of playing I got that to work, thanks for the tip.
Thanks! :)
I'll check this out. Thanks. By any chance do you know if we can wrap basemap projection around a sphere cause I need to plot coordinates on the globe not just the texture for visual appeal.
well the term "developer" is probably a bit overused. So you i'd say it is important to distinguish it clearly from a programmer. I'd say a developer is way more involved in the - development - that means the basic structure of a project (requirements, project structure, software architecture, design, testing, ... i am not a developer so add everything important here that i forgot). Clearly a very specialized tool set that you have to learn. While a data scientist (very much like me, an engineer) solves a very specific problem in a project, basically every specialized function that works with data. User interface? Requirements? Software architecture? Who cares, i'll figure out how those two data sets are correlated! So two very different fields, a data scientist managing a project would probably create a mess because nobody thought him about it at university. Just like a developer would probably not be able to solve the problems of a data scientist because he only knows basic math. But i don't think that's the full story. Everyone who graduates from a university has to design and implement at least two projects (bachelor and master thesis) so i'd say many data scientists know at least the basics of being a developer, especially the good ones. While most "pure" developers probably don't have a clue about data science or just any specialized field because it is a lot easier for them to avoid it. As a data scientist it's almost impossible to avoid all software development. And from my experience most "developers" in my field of work are very experienced engineers. They've got the math and science down from university and learned about development by working on few projects. Leaving you with a very valuable engineer/developer. The other way round is a lot harder but i've met some very impressive IT people teaching themselves all about the product their working on, but they just don't understand the problems and details like an engineer.

The problem is that the words "Python Software Developer" don't mean what you want them to mean. They don't have any fixed definition. A couple of data scientists I work with wrote an amazing app in Python, including a GUI interface, that collects data from your social media activities and provides visualization feedback. By any rational definition of "Python Software Development", this is a piece of software written in Python that they developed. Can any data scientist develop any Python software? Of course not. But your need to decree absolutes is kind of silly. &amp;#x200B;
You are quite welcome, and happy learning! Also, I'll add that you figured out how to speed up a search over billions of combinations in Python, which is not something to take lightly. Understanding generators the way you do is a great python skill. 
We're currently having this discussion in my firm and I think people don't really understand the semantics they're talking about. &amp;#x200B; Python, like all "development" work is a vast ocean. What does it mean to be a Python developer? Does it imply webapps? Data pipelines? Data analysis? Turns out you can do tons of different work in Python. &amp;#x200B; Anyone working in a community of practice like Python needs to understand the language, best practices, and good design principles, regardless of what specific domain you are working in. Our data scientists, just like our full stack engineers, are building component pieces of larger applications, so their Python could should be developed with the exact same standard of care and attention to maintainability and scale. Now, I'm not saying their analysis needs the same level of attention to principles, but we have a problem where people ship analysis and wash their hands of the project with dire down stream consequences. &amp;#x200B; The distinction between data scientist and developer may vary based on your firm's level of maturity, but if you work in Python then you need some "software developer skills", however you define it. The data science artifacts, if implemented, are just software.
Does this have any relationship to a Wankel Rotary engine? Because that's all I see.
I never realised it wa possible to make a cube out of 3 pyramids like that.
It would help if there was a legend and axis labels. But that would probably only help enough so that you *really* have no idea what's going on
What type of application does this have? 
I can bet this would have some unusual application in a different, seemingly unrelated field. Such is the world of mathematics!
Biologically speaking, see my comment here https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b8buj2/z/ejx42ro Mathematically speaking it's an example where breaking up a differential equation into discrete parts can make the system much more analytically tractable.

I agree about latex+matplotlib! Embarrassingly this is my only published python-generated figure that doesn't use latex.
Very useful post but, isn’t the whole point of going to a park to unplug?
Yeah I get that. Maybe something on the axes to indicate what x, y, and z represent and that they are normalized. And maybe a legend to describe what the different line colors mean. I just feel like I should get a better sense of what is going on just by looking at the figure. That said, it is a very attractive figure. I don't mean to belittle it.
This week I'm using Python to generate a parameter space for a plasma physics code to run thousands of times on one of the systems at NERSC, and then unwrapping the 2D results of that simulation to generate dozens of input files for an ancient Fortran plasma-materials interaction code. Or, if I were writing the paper about it, "file-based code coupling." I'm also using Keras to train a model to reproduce and interpolate between results at each step (which is much faster than running a new simulation); this is, shockingly, already working well with low resolution test data, which is very exciting!
Be more precise. What software do you develop?

You should add a snap command that deletes half the messages in a channel.
You are going to need a few things, first start small. Look for and eBay rest api if they have one see if it will do what you want. The look at Craigslist and see if they have an open api. Once you know that. You’ll need to learn the api or see if someone has built a library already that can work with the apis you are wanting to talk to. Once do that get fulminate with Json and parsing it. If all else fails you can uses beautifulsoup to do this but it be a bit more work. This is just a baseline of what you will run into.

Without an external module like numpy, Python doesn't really have 2D arrays, it has nested lists of lists. Try solving your problem for just one list, like \[1,2,3,4,5\], and then see if you can work out how to extend that solution for a list of lists.

I'm writing a script to get all reddit submissions from a series of subreddits for an entire year, and then get every comment to all of those submissions. I've grossly overcomplicated it at this point and need to backtrack a little ;) .
Which graphing package are you using?
Astronomy data visualizer widget using WebRTC and Jupyter.

I started yet another library for automating GUI applications on Windows. None of the existing solutions has the right combination of performance, features, and API that I want. So far I've got stuff like this working: ``` &gt;&gt;&gt; cw = CurrentWindows() &gt;&gt;&gt; 'Untitled - Notepad' in cw True &gt;&gt;&gt; notepad = CurrentWindows['Untitled - Notepad'] &gt;&gt;&gt; type(notepad) Window(1234817) ``` This morning I'm adding a bunch of features to the `Window` class.
Working on my game engine. Writing a discord bot to execute commands on a spigot server (includes Java for spigot plugin). Learning more about discordpy to make my cookbook bigger ~~[shameless plug](https://gist.github.com/wilfred-kun/15f20c068e9306955c6c3f6a8450aaca)~~. I won't be bored.
Which modules from the standard library are you using to get the bytecode?
This is a simulation of the 2D diffusion equation, demonstrated for stochastic diffusion of an initially Gaussian density distribution of water vapour in air. The solution to the diffusion equation at each time step is found using a standard finite difference scheme, and in parallel for all grid points with PyOpenCL. The time propagation employs the forward Euler method. This particular simulation is performed on a 64 x 64 computational grid, over 100ms in time steps of 0.01 ms - which is equivalent to about 40 million individual points at which the solution is found. It runs in about 0.2 seconds, so I think it's quite computationally efficient. All hand-coded, here's the source code if anyone is interested: https://github.com/ModeHopper/diffusion_equation
You can't imagine how often I have to explain people that there's a difference between a scripter and a developer, and how many scripters are hired as developers and then literally destroy companies by bankrupting them in technical debt.
I've been working on a program that turns a text file of entertainment website links into a database, in order to make transferring bookmarks between my phone's Pythonista app and my laptop possible. I only have around six whole sites cracked for now, but the fact that it works on my phone's python app AND my computer is shocking for me.
I'm just using `compile(my_code, "&lt;input&gt;", "exec").co_code` to get the opcode bytes, and then I'm using `struct.unpack` (mainly `struct.unpack("bb", op)`) to get the numerical values.
I'm working on a [Minecraft server in Python](https://github.com/martmists/MCServer) which is pretty difficult, but we're getting it down bit by bit.
Finally transferred from 2 to python 3. No big problems encountered with old scripts :)
Thank you! With no context I'm over here like, "Are we talking about a programming language, or what the person was wearing while making it, or...?" 
No, thats what you do at work.
afaik pytest is the gold standard in 2019. A technique I've heard is to write a test for each bug you fix - that doesn't help you retroactively build test suites but is a good rule of thumb to make sure your bug fixes stick. Philosophically I would want to see tests are isolated from other dependencies (e.g. use sample data loaded locally, not from a remote database that can also fail - that should be tested separately). Your failing tests will be more informative if you can identify the problem easily.
Good thread 👏
no, i want to use the module numpy is there a function for it
thanks but isn't there a function in numpy which does this, if so what is it?
First you need to actually make a numpy array using numpy.array(). Then you have a number of options, including the numpy.where() function. &amp;#x200B;

I would recommend going over to /r/learnpython and starting there, that subreddit is geared for questions exactly like this. 
Oh I didnt know about that subreddit, thx a lot!
You could do what I do and use a vtkBillboardTextActor which basically puts a 2d label in 3D space. Not sure exactly what your question means. I don’t do texture maps. I just apply a fringe (scalar map) to a model, have a legend, a displacement map and a vector field to represent forces. I also probe it.
Of course! Make sure to take a look at their sidebar, too. Enjoy!

Subreddit rules say that "how-to" questions must be posted in /r/learnpython, not here.
why do you want numpy?
Sounds very cool. I'm working on webscraping a list of shareholders in multiple companies, but I'm still learning the very basics such as HTML. I think my project is quite challenging as I have to make a program that searches the name of the company, click on the correct company, and then click on "view more" to get the full list. 
I wrote a webscraping script that will extract all key information of products from competitors websites. I also automated an email that will alert us what changed. I take all the products and key information and put into a sqlite table(not sure if this proper terminology), with a datetime stamp. I'm also not sure if this is efficient but I feel comfortable with sql. After today's info was added to the table, I do three test. If there are new products, if a product was removed, if products stayed the same then check if any of the info changed. Depending on those three it will send a different email to the email list, but it won't send anything if products stay the same and no info changes. Right now I have the email list pickled and every time I add someone I manually appended the list. &amp;#x200B; Does anyone have any suggestions in how I could make this better?
I'm working on a legacy project using blinker signals to talk to a 3rd party API, I'm toying with the idea of replacing it with a task queue, first thought of rq but that means Redis as a dependency. How sane would be to replace blinker with huey running in-memory or sqlite? System load will be low to medium. I just want to simplify the architecture overall, I find task queues so much easier to grasp. Thanks for the good work Charles!

Trying to get the next release of my open source FEA project out. It's kinda one of those things where yeah, I can do a release once every 2 years or do a release once a year. Just need to finish off a few more tickets, not because I need to, but because they're cool features. I punted all the harder, more impressive, tickets to the next version. Also, this will be the last version to support Python 2.7, so that's kind of cool. More subtly, something I could release now with a minor API change later, will become a Python 3.6+ only feature.

He already did, go google it if you don't get it, this is a basic thing and not proper content for /r/python anyways. Don't expect people to teach you things that the vast majority of people learn from 5 minutes of googling. Try posting to /r/learnpython, maybe somebody there can make more sense to you. I can't see how to make it more clear than it already is here.
Interesting use of mind mapping, though I'd argue the learning process was proably much more linear than the map implies.
Udemy has good courses for cheap. In addition to that, if you’re employed somewhere (not assuming age), find a broken process and a use case for python and build something.
I'm writing a web service in flask! Using sqlalchemy as my orm which connects to an oracle db. One of my biggest hurdles is trying to keep it generic as possible so it can be utilized for other use cases later on. I'm learning a ton and having a lot of fun!
The one I made looks nice and functions well but then it crashes after it's done completing the task I gave it lol.
I'm nowhere near the level of everyone else here, but I've been learning how to use PyCharm in general and that's made me happy :)
That’s fair. Plus you get the excuse to have more tartiflette!
I assume you meant learn python - I use Google cloud a lot, and there's a python library for every service I've used so far. It's super convenient and flexible, so I would recommend trying it out. Worst case scenario you'll just learn a new language. What do you have to lose ;) ?
I'm building my own python blog in Flask where I'll post about new python subjects that I learn and write tutorials from beginner's point of view, with hope to help other beginners out on not-so-easy to understand topics.

Ask this in /r/learnpython.
Yes, I meant learn haha. I’m enrolled in an online B.S. in IT right now with a specialization in Virtualization and Cloud Computing. Python will be the first language I’ve had experience with. I’m using Codecademy so far and really like it. 
Good luck then! And I wouldn't be worried about learning python being a waste of time, it's used everywhere. You won't fall short of opportunities with that in your tools.
Alright.

Please tell me you didn’t actually expose your authentication key on a Reddit post. A 403 Forbidden can mean a lot of things... you may need to authenticate, you may have been rate limited or blocked... it looks like your basic code is working, but you’ll have to read the full response body to figure out why the server is rejecting your request.

Seconded. Perfectly labeled axes and aesthetically appealing. Well done OP.
Well it was a bad idea to post your API key, and you should revoke it ASAP. However your code does not pass the key to google's servers, that is why you are getting an error. Maybe you should look at official python docs: [https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/code\_samples/python](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/code_samples/python) You are going to need to authenticate before your calls are going to work.

Hey -- this is awesome. I've been on the lookout for a long time for some sort of graph calculation that is similar to excel and haven't really had an idea on how to build one. Finance background, but more on acquisitions than trading. A lot of the stuff we do is date-driven -- how would you set up something in this library on date-oriented conditionals?

Looks good! I've wanted to use this data myself. A few really minor points: - `requests.Response` objects have a `.json()` method for convenience so you don't need `json.loads(response.text)` yourself. - there are a couple of places where you take a `params` dict, then modify it before using it. Those modifications will also exist in the user's reference to the dict, outside of the function, which might surprise them. - having a `__version__ = "your.version.here"; __version_info__ = tuple(int(i) for i in __version__.split('.'))` in the `__init__.py` is often helpful. You can use something like [bump2version](https://pypi.org/project/bump2version/) to make sure all your version strings stay in sync with each release. - You might find something [tabulate](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/) saves you some trouble when printing tables.

Ah, I now see what you're meaning. If the ads are run in an iframe (they very rarely aren't) , first use the request to get the page, removing the iframe, then open the modified page
The graph currently supports the following node types ``` Another graph float string integer boolean datetime (i.e. Python datetime) ``` So, yes you can have date/time columns and have dependencies on them. It also supports circular dependencies with being able to go around the circles more than once (your option). With that you can implement a quasi optimization. Send me your stuff, but I cannot promise timely delivery 
Writing a collector for our analytics TICK stack/influxdb system. Our ticketing system doesn't capture a whole lot of historical information about tickets. It does for things like SLAs, but what about the status right after it was assigned, or any number of states that we want to report on? They have ticket history, but when someone hits the edit button, the ticket history only shows that it was edited and by who. That's it. I want to know what they changed. So here I am creating a collector. Better to write it in Python first and get it working, then use cython to get more seed out of it.
&gt; first use the request to get the page, remove the iframe, then open the modified page I'm not sure I understand. How do I change the code so that the iframe renders correctly?
I usually interleave two or three concepts that I'm learning. For example, I could learn pytest while solving some [py.checkio.org](https://py.checkio.org) problems and creating tests for the solutions, and in the same time reading a book about TDD.

May I recommend looking into PEP. Excellent work, but camelCase is against PEP standards. Rather than \` videoToFrames\_Grey\` just use \`video\_to\_frames\_grey\`, or if its named for the sake of allowing more options, why not pass grey as an argument? \`video\_to\_frames('grey')\`?
Try websockets
So you wish for the advert to be visible or not? If you wish for it to be not there, you must download the page via the requests library, then parse the page to remove the iframe with the correct name / tag relevant to the one holding the ad you want removed. Then, open up the modified html page using python It's a long word around, but should work
I want the adverts to be visible I don't want them to appear in the form of a broken HTML string. Comparing the two sections of code I get these as outputs, it looks like python doesn't understand the "&amp;" symbol: &lt;div class="code-block code-block-8" style="margin: 8px auto;text-align: center;display: block;clear: both"&gt; &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:970px;height:90px" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6809862060302897" data-ad-slot="5240011758" data-adsbygoogle-status="done"&gt;&lt;ins id="aswift_1_expand" style="display:inline-table;border:none;height:90px;margin:0;padding:0;width:970px;background-color:transparent"&gt;&lt;ins id="aswift_1_anchor" style="display:block;border:none;height:90px;margin:0;padding:0;width:970px;background-color:transparent"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/ins&gt; (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="code-block code-block-8" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;"&gt; &lt;script async="" src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:970px;height:90px" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6809862060302897" data-ad-slot="5240011758" data-adsbygoogle-status="done"&gt;&lt;ins id="aswift_1_expand" style="display:inline-table;border:none;height:90px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:970px;background-color:transparent;"&gt;&lt;ins id="aswift_1_anchor" style="display:block;border:none;height:90px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:970px;background-color:transparent;"&gt;&lt;iframe width="970" height="90" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" vspace="0" hspace="0" allowtransparency="true" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="true" onload="var i=this.id,s=window.google_iframe_oncopy,H=s&amp;amp;&amp;amp;s.handlers,h=H&amp;amp;&amp;amp;H[i],w=this.contentWindow,d;try{d=w.document}catch(e){}if(h&amp;amp;&amp;amp;d&amp;amp;&amp;amp;(!d.body||!d.body.firstChild)){if(h.call){setTimeout(h,0)}else if(h.match){try{h=s.upd(h,i)}catch(e){}w.location.replace(h)}}" id="aswift_1" name="aswift_1" style="left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0px;width:970px;height:90px;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/ins&gt; &lt;script&gt;(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt; Is there a way I can get it to read the "&amp;" correctly instead of throwing in a H&amp;amp;&amp;amp instead?

Thanks for the tips! I'll implement it in the game :)
Ok, I will . thank u anyway
how can i add it to my website &amp;#x200B;
Yes! It's a 3 dimensional differential equation
There are more characters that need to be escaped than you're handling in `urlify`. Python already has a function -- `urllib.parse.urlencode` -- to do URL encoding correctly. For something like this, though, you should probably be using the [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) library which makes it much, much easier. ``` import requests for submission in reddit.subreddit("Meme_Battles").top(limit=10): requests.get( "https://newfastuff.com/wp-content/apps/php_files/&lt;the php file&gt;", params={ "imgurl": submission.url, "title": submission.title[13:] }, ) ``` 
Great backronym!

Thanks the the suggestion. Old habits die hard. 
Believe me I understand haha
Huey by default consists of three processes: producer (your app), consumer (provided by huey), and storage (Redis). Since sqlite is embedded, you have two processes: producer and consumer. The sqlite database is effectively doing ipc (plus persistence). So in memory wouldn't work, because the in memory db used by your app is not visible to the consumer process. That being said, huey can be run embedded in the application, so now you have one process with presumably multiple threads. Now the issue is that typically sqlite in-memory databases are only visible to the connection that opened them. And huey's sqlite implementation doesn't allow sharing connections across threads.
[Sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex/playlists) on YouTube. The dude is amazing and has tutorials from beginning Python up through machine learning and more. His self driving car in GTA is pretty cool too but I haven't the foggiest how he did it.
Do you have a purpose for this other than self-improvement or education? Not that those are not valid goals in themselves, I'm just curious.
I am making a scraper as my first project. I am still learning the language so it's basically a lot of trial and error. I love the fact that working on a project makes me understand the language faster. I started this project since at my work we need to make a lot of comparisons for customers on the company's website. However 1 comparison can give a return of 4-5 a4 pages. I asked IT to crop it more so it can fit on 1 page and we are 2 years later.... So the crawler basically uses 1 to 5 queries with user inputs and returns the info on 1 a4 to print. I am fairly new at this (used to program basic in .bat files :p) and I hope I can come up with some intermediate code soon :).
Great job! I might suggest taking the todo list and putting them as issues.
I'll check him up. Thank u so much 
That's an open-ended question. Try [Scipy integrate](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/integrate.html) or [Diffeqpy](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/diffeqpy)
If you use Word right, you set up styles and use headings and can easily change their formatting. You don't have to go through all pages.
I second this! Try to make this as finished of a product as possible. No notes to yourself in places that are meant for users. The readme file is like a short advertisement to attract new users. Use the issues links in the GitHub interface for todos. Also: - your readme should explain installation and give a taste of what the package can do. - Make a users guide that is separate from the resdme. - Create some Jupyter notebooks to help illustrate the main functionality. - don't make people import everything separately. Import everything into your __init__ so that the whole package imports all at once. Then use it with `nom.report()` or whatever. - add a contributers guide so people can gives you pull requests.

setup.py is just a script like any other. See [this](https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/minimal.html), seems a pretty decent resource.
You just make a setup.py and all that and put it in your project.

sorry to be so vague, I really just don't know where to begin
I've been having fun learning python at datacamp. It's free and pretty good.
Here's a start: What are you modelling? Some categories: -Nbody simulations -Wave equations / quantum mechanics -Collisions -Fluid dynamics -Thermodynamics
Sorry, I'm rereading my post now and I realize that its not clear I'm talking about modeling kinematics. The idea is to try to get something simple like a 2d stick figure to be able to walk. 
Thank you!
Hey! First I just want to thank you for taking such a thorough look through the code -- I appreciate that so much. These pointers are very helpful, I will definitely refactor the code to make the improvements you mentioned. I should probably use `copy.copy()` to make a copy of the params dict, do you think that would be the best approach?
I followed [this](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/) tutorial, but others have already shared great resources that are helpful as well.
Thanks :)
Wow, these are all really great pointers, thanks for the thoughtful advice. I definitely could've managed modules a bit better, that was one of the biggest headaches in getting the package together. Can I simply import each of the modules into \_\_init\_\_.py and the user will just have to `import noms`?
[Live Stream here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csL8DLXGNlU) 
It looks even cooler with [colors inverted](https://i.imgur.com/lHAZYoC.png) :D
You can just do \`dict(my\_dict)\` - so long as you only need a shallow copy (i.e. you're not mutating anything other than the top level dict). You can even do \`dict(my\_dict, key="whatever")\`, although possibly only on modern versions of python.
Great, thank you! 
I've attended several Pycons and Pygothams, and this is the first pycon in which i'll be staying for sprints. I look forward to it!

Do you mean building things on the cloud? If so, then you probably mean building docker containers, and launching them on kubernetes, or possibly building apps to exist on kubernetes. In the former 2, i didnt really use python much, most things at my company were just done with bash (for better or worse). Obviously the same thing could be done with python, albeit much more slowly and less portability. As for building cloud native applications on kubernetes, our company prefers us to use Go since that is what kubernetes is written in and therefore has the most up to date libraries. The same libs exist in python but are not going to be treated as a first class citizen, idk if the python lib is even maintained by Google itself.
Pybullet and Drake are both great for kinematics. 
Yah, nothing wrong with it except dependencies keep breaking. Used to love spider. I couldn’t keep it configured correctly.
Give VScode a spin. Very capable and lightweight. I run it on a 10 year old laptop no problem.
Just wondering, do you really get a real world speed up using pyopencl here compared to normal numpy array operations?
I have some side projects which I work on: 1) an adventure text based game 2) an online chat application 3) new words generator
What is the software/tools you used to create this? Seems to me a more natural task to finish with Tikz/PGFPLOT in LaTeX
Convert the string to decimal and format with expected precision. Don’t ever store currency in floating point variables
It sounds simple, and I am trying to figure it out, but I am new to this. How do I convert the string to decimal? add Decimal(req['bpi']['USD']['rate'].replace(',' , ''))?
Try int() 
A financial option pricer. I am new to programming and I thought leveraging my financial background is a good way to learn. So! I am trying to work out a black-scholes modelization that doesn't use normal distribution and relies on weighting daily stock data over the past year and short term intraday stock fluctuation differently. 
Look at issues in open source projects with labels like "good first issue", "beginner", etc.
https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/decimal.html
Writing a library that uses Python setters and getters to make it easy to automatically convert temperatures-- no conversion function needed. It stores the temperature as Kelvin, and calculated based on that, upon retrieval. Usage: temperature.celsius = 100 print temperature.fahrenheit # output : 212
[removed]
Gives me this error: ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '4950.7150'
Haha he said anal
Sorry, float() 
Yea I am trying to figure that out.. that gives me this error: TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "float") to str
I think asking that specific question on /r/learnpython might help. They will be able to provide more support and explain some of these libraries. Also stack overflow is a great resource to help answer questions as well. 
Try: from decimal import Decimal d = "1,234,567.8901" print(round(Decimal(d.replace(",", "")), 2)) Replace 2 with 0 to round to a whole value. When using Decimal for money in critical accounting operations make sure the rounding rules, etc of the default match your jurisdiction (use `decimal.getcontext()` to inspect the details of the default context).
Telegram is another nice option. It's an instant messenger with a public REST API for building bots. There are tons of wrapper libraries for the API, and you can send pictures, rich text, etc. should you want to. We have a bot at work that sends Grafana alerts to a Telegram channel, complete with chart screenshots. It's pretty neat. 
TLDR: an example with just enough difference to make you (OP) learn import decimal as ayylmao variable = "69,420.000007" variable.replace(',', '') # or whatever variable = ayylmao(variable) variable.round() # or whatever
I use python everyday for more and more things. I work on aws, azure and some gcp in various cloud architecture, devops and sre type roles. A little bit of python can solve most problems 👍
The output from that API already includes the values as floats in the `rate_float` key. Also, as has been mentioned, you should be using `Decimal`. ``` import requests from decimal import Decimal def main(self): req = requests.get('https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json') req = req.json(parse_int=Decimal, parse_float=Decimal) dollar = '1 BTC = ${}'.format(req['bpi']['USD']['rate_float'].quantize(Decimal('0.00'))) ```
Thanks, but when I use it in my code I get this error: TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "decimal.Decimal") to str My code looks like this now: def main(self): req = requests.get('https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json') req = req.json() price = req['bpi']['USD']['rate'] rounded_price = round(Decimal(price.replace(",", "")), 2) ticker = '1 BTC = $' + rounded_price 
That error is saying "I tried to combine a float and a string but I couldn't. I can only combine strings with other strings." So look at your code and find where you're trying to combine a float and a string. On the final line you have '1 BTC = $' + (rounded_price) That's a string + float. You wrapped the float in parentheses but that has no effect heren so it's still a float. You can cast it to a string by doing str(rounded_price) str() is a function that can take a bunch of types (including float) and return a stringified version. This converting from one type to another is called type casting. 
This community is usually focused on more mature, sometimes complicated projects that don't necessarily have a lot of beginner friendly contribution opportunities. Most of them have "doc writing" as a beginner thing but, let's be honest, no one wants to do that!! /r/learnpython is going to be a lot more help here. There are probably more up to date on what projects have beginner opportunities and still have a strong community around them. 
Yeah, you’d need to do `str(rounded_price)`, or better yet use _string formatting_ via either `ticker = “1 BTC = ${}”.format(rounded_price)` or in newer versions of Python you could use _f-strings_ and `ticker = f”1 BTC = ${rounded_price}”`.
You can try p5 with python, its greate for learning. https://github.com/p5py/p5 https://processing.org I teach programming with it.
I do cloud things. Mostly in c++ but occasionally there will be large, mechanical tasks that I need to do and it's so much easier to whip together something in python than struggle to figure out some archaic bash syntax. 
Thanks for the explanation, this helped a lot. All good now!

&gt; str(rounded_price) Damn that was it, thanks a lot. I knew it was simple, and I am glad you all took the time to explain these things to me because now I actually understand why it needs to be like that. There were some alternate suggestions from others that would probably work as well. 
To get around the dict problem, you can always do something like this: new_version = dict(current_version, change="hello", bing="bang") It'll create a copy with the given modifications.
Thanks a lot, this helps. How exactly do I add the comma back into the output?
If you do not know anything of programming is a good idea starting from https://www.learnpython.org/, this is a very basic tutorial for python. The best way to learn programming is to code... Find every time a more difficult task and try to code it, when you found a problem search on Internet a solution, read and try to understand it. In few time you will be see great progress! Alternatively you can found on Internet few simple programs and try to understand it searching what every line of code/function do...
Is it pyqt5? There's an exception hook thing you can do to get the tracebacks too show up! 
Oh for sure, without it there'd be two pretty hefty for-loops and I'd be calculating each grid point one after the other
Machine Learning is one of the hottest trend at present . The demand for Machine Learning is so much that the vacancy are much more than the candidate. By looking the high demand most of the Training Institute provides Courses for Machine learning. We can use many programming language in Machine learning like python , java , SQL but the projects which are assigned are usually prefer to be done using Python. This is the reason why we are asked to [Grab the knowledge of python](http://pythonandmltrainingcourses.com/courses/best-diploma-in-python-course-in-delhi/) . There are many more application of python like in Data science, data Analytic etc.
[removed]
Should `return` at the end, surely? 
Same.
Python is the object oriented and high level programming language with dynamic semantics. Python has easy syntax. firstly you need to [learn python](http://pythonandmltrainingcourses.com/6-months-training-in-noida/) in depth after you will able to learn data science if you are not good in the python you can't learn data science in good way.The demand of python and data science increase day by day that why you need to learn python and data science in the depth because these 2 language on high demanding in the industry. 
Good bot.
It is supposed to return when n is 1 that is the end
This question is better suited for r/learnpython, but to answer your question, you are resetting `lists` to `[]` in each call of `empty_list` so you'll always end up with a list containing only one empty list. You should be doing something like this instead: def empty_list(n): assert n &gt; 0 if n == 1: return [[]] lists = empty_list(n-1) lists.append([]) return lists print (empty_list(5)) 
IronPython has been for years atleast.
Yes but if that's the only `return`, then your intermediate results will never be passed back up the call stack. 
I hope this version is compatible with Python 3
it is not, there's some alpha development for python 3
Love the name 
May I suggest you have a look at pytest next time you feel like going through your unit tests? [https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) It's a great test framework. Very little boilerplate code, support for reporting, fixtures, mocking and much more.
Thanks
Try first activating the anaconda environment in your terminal, then switching to the directory of the program in the terminal and running: code (program name).py, then opening the VS Code terminal again and running the program from within it
are you using a conda environment? I've had similar problems after upgrading the base environment. Solved it by doing a clean install and setting up things from scratch
i'm not going to install an app.
Couldn't you just use 2d matrix operations (no for loops needed) ? That is what I have done previously for problems like this. Also 2 for loops accelerated with numba gives about the same speed up as the array operations (with just 1 line of extra code compared to the naive double for loop approach) 
If by that you mean if I have created a conda enviroment (sorry, as I said I'm a beginner), then no, I haven't. All I do is open the anaconda prompt and try to use pip to install stuff (pip should automatically come with anaconda, if i understood correctly).
Oh yeah, sure there are a bunch of other ways you could do it. This was primarily just me teaching myself how PyOpenCL works though, and I just picked this particular problem because I thought it would make for some nice visualisations. I'm not sure how you'd use 2D matrix operations, because the forward time step for each point relies on a 5-point stencil of the neighbouring points - it's not like a matrix multiplication or anything
you really should use an environment. I recommend you read this: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html especially how to create and activate, and https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#using-pip-in-an-environment for installing pip into that environment
Don’t overthink it... you don’t need an **assert**, you only need to return `f(n-1)` extended with a single [] if **n** is greater than 0, otherwise return []. A matrix with 0 items is an empty list... a matrix with -100 items is nonsensical, but would still probably be best represented by an empty list. This can be done in three lines.
Ok thank you. I will read it!
an app that extracts data from a DataLake. 
anaconda also comes with its own packaging system, so after you activate an environment, you can use `pip` as normal, but also `conda install &lt;package&gt;` - maybe you'll have better luck with that?
The “:,” in the format string adds the comma separators.
Just exploring what I can do a bit, so far I've managed to make a decorator for omitting return: ```py @omit_return def choose(check, if_true, if_false): if check: if_true else: if_false choose(True, 1, 2) # =&gt; 1 choose(False, 1, 2) # =&gt; 2 ``` And I've made a decorator for modifying code at runtime: ```py @replace("y = 2", "y = 2*x") def test(): x = 5 y = 2 return x * y # Would normally return 10 # Now it returns 50 test() # =&gt; 50 ```
If you look at the screenshot you see they are already activating anaconda. Much more likely that it's hitting Python on the PATH before the one in the Anaconda environment. To test you can try running: &lt;full path to Python in Anaconda virtual env&gt; &lt;Python file to run&gt; If that works you know what the issue is and you can just modify your PATH to remove Python (The non-Anaconda version).
See this for a steady state implementation of 2d laplace solver with vector/array/matrix operations. Expansion to transient solver should be triviial. Let me know if I am missing something here . :) [https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/barbagroup/CFDPython/blob/master/lessons/12\_Step\_9.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/barbagroup/CFDPython/blob/master/lessons/12_Step_9.ipynb)
The best thing is to join a class because that worked for me (online learning is not my thing) but there are some basics that you can learn easily from online which I realised after joining a course. Search for *cs dojo* in YouTube and see his old videos about python. He uses anaconda and Jupiter notebook but you can use any other ide as you wish...
Really good! My criticisms: 1) read up on pep-8. If you work in a group of developers you will most likely have to follow it or similar. CamelCaseFuctions() look like class definitions in your case. It is minor but will drive people crazy. 2) you took the time to make great doc strings above your functions. Now, move them under you function. def my_great_function(name): “”” Takes money from the bank accounts of everyone and puts it in the names account. :param name: Name of the person to become rich :type name: str :return: True if successful “”” I am on my phone so please excuse any formatting strangness
Nice project! There are a lot of for loops with the \`range(len(...))\`. You should simply iterate over the sequence to access each element. If you really need the index use \`enumerate()\`. E.g. \`\`\` for ni in range(len(r\_nut)): r\_nut\[ni\]\['value'\] = 1 - r\_nut\[ni\]\['value'\] \`\`\` Could be written as \`\`\` for ni in r\_nut: ni\['value'\] = 1 - ni\['value'\] \`\`\` Also, in \`export\_report()\` you open the CSV file but never close it. You should probably [use a context manager](https://realpython.com/python-csv/) for that part (or even \`pandas.DataFrame.to\_csv()\` if you want).
Oh boy, I see what they've done there, that's pretty smart in terms of Pythonics. All I would say, however, is that vector operations in Python are basically just C/Fortran for-loops. Since the PyOpenCL kernel is written in C I imagine the speed of the actual operations would be somewhat similar. The only difference is that with PyOpenCL you can parallelise it - so whereas the Python array operation is a set of fast C for-loops over the array, the PyOpenCL approach allows all (or a subset) of the array points to be calculated in parallel. I guess the question is then, at what grid size does the PyOpenCL overhead become a worthwhile penalty for the increased speed of the actual calculations?
Exactly my question! Please update if you benchmark the two approaches.
The basic thing is whatever the ide that you use will definitely use the default python interpreter idle( or atleast pycharm does that for sure) so its all about the extra features that it offers. First thing is that you should find an text editor of your taste(in ui obviously) and the feature count depends on your usage of you use or need a lot of features then for for pycharm or of just want to change your ide the try Sublime text (don't go by the name... It offers decent no. of features and has an active community). It has a free version and also paid one. The next option is vs code 
Haha, I've gone full circle haven't I! I see what you were asking about originally now though. If I ever get round to benchmarking it I'll let you know. It would certainly be good to find out, unfortunately I have other things going on at the moment so won't be able to do it any time soon.
I never had that problem (so far)...I always do package updates with the recommended conda update --all
Yes, I've had a play, seems quite fine. But I do love a "play" button, which I can't seem to find in VS Code :)
Having drinks with PHP 6.
This might be a stupid question - but did you start VS Code from the Anaconda GUI? I stopped using Anaconda because I didn’t want to activate the conda env all the time like that. 
Working on making a Google Cloud Dataflow NLP pipeline reproducible been pretty painful as I haven't worked with Dataflow before. Using apache-beam for execution is pretty cool.
All the time, for all kinds of things. For instance one of my projects requires building a Docker image, turning it into a tarball and uploading it to one of the servers. That in turn requires seeing if the image already exists and is currently running in a container, stopping the container if it exists, deleting the image if it exists, and then starting the build. Or just running the python script I wrote to do it all for me. Just a heads-up, though - learning your second (or third, or Nth) programming language is a lot easier than learning the previous one was.
Great! I'm glad it helped. Most of these things I figured out one painful mistake at a time! Yes, import everything that you want the user to have at the basic level into the init for the package. You can check it using `dir(nom)` to see what is available to the user at that level. You can use `help(nom.my_func)` to see the docstrings.
We're developing a Chrome Extension that let's you schedule notebooks with one click. Would you be interested in trying it out? Please DM me if so.
Damn cool. I went and stared at the original piece of art for a while and really liked it. It’d be cool if there was a moment that your generative animation that had the same conditions as the artwork. 
Is it really? I doubt they can beat PyCharm on code analysis quality. 
Link isn't working I'm guessing you meant https://globfone.com/call-phone/ Well here it is below using xpath from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 10) wait.until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.XPATH, "//*[@id=\"next-step\"]"))).click()
Matplotlib, numpy. Solutions were precomputed (just had to solve a series of linear differential equations). Pretty minimal. I usually use latex too (check out the other plots in the paper). I will look into tikz/PGFPLOT, thank you!
Is it open-source? This doesn't say much about Python without a link to your GitHub page.
It can be visual studio 2029...but if iron python is based on python 2, your can be only a dream 
I made a very simple chatbot for my students to play with. Feel free to use it https://github.com/jamesabela/AlevelChatbot With regex you could extend it quite a lot....
Data
Is it a good course? Can you already code anything? I was thinking about starting it, but I don't know if it is worth it.
I mostly want it for a drag &amp; drop form designer for my quick scripting needs
This is not trivial. Seems like a problem suited for machine learning. You would need large sets of data to train the algorithm on, but you’d also need that data to be in a form that suits the project. Shazam does some interesting stuff with music recognition that I’ve read about. Regardless, this is likely beyond the scope of some beginner hobby project. 
you're right, iron python doesn't make any progress
You need a file to house the Domain list. Research how to read a file, loop through it, and store the data in a list/array. I would choose a dictionary myself. Make everything false, 0, etc. Loop through the log, again reading a file, and check each value against the domain list. If found, if using a dict, increment the value/ false to true, etc. After it all, iterate through the dict and output to a file. Things needed to research. Read in from file, out to a file. Dictionary usage, check if value is in it, its format, etc. And looping through the files, dictionaries, etc. 
The whole repository is fucking fantastic!
yes as you can seen in video.
That's for IronPython only still.
Seems good so far, it does run through a few programs as you go through the course. Pig Latin being the latest one I've done.
That a good start and as you ask for feedback here you are : - Add a Readme file to your repo, with at least some line to explain what your programm do - Add docstring to your function - refractor your code to respect the DRY rule (Don't repeat yourself) - split your single script into several script, it will be easier to read and manage 
you have several smaller problems to solve before you can get to what you actually want to do. As another poster mentioned, this is a project where a machine learning approach is most appropriate. Sounds will vary in many ways, and you will not be successful trying to match something to a fixed reference sound; you need a corpus of sounds that are representative of what you want to compare against. That is the first problem to solve: how do you collect hundreds of examples of the sound you want to recognize and how do you standardize them to a specific size for programming? You also need plenty examples of sounds that are not what you are looking for, as a way to test your approach. Another problem to consider is that many sounds are not stationary; they vary in frequency and in time. A DFT is not sufficient, you need multiple DFTs, preferably taken over different windows of time. This is less of an issue if you use a neural network, but something to consider. A third problem is that the sound you want to recognize is influenced by its environment. If you think of the room it was recorded in and the equipment that recorded it as a system, that system will change the frequency response and phase of the sound. You would need to generate additional input data by time-shifting, scaling, and frequency shifting each of your inputs. Deciding how to do so is not easy. This is a lot to think about, but it is not insurmountable. You can get going by solving thw first problem (getting regular input data) and adapting a classifier tutorial to work on that data. From there, add improvements to address the other issues.
What is a pyde file? Does that account for the unimported functions like fill and arc? Seriously interesting and I can’t help but think that the original artist would be proud that his art inspired this.
This is very well made! Good job!
See python as a tool for doing data science, there are related only because many libraries have been developed for python to help data scientist. In fact, you should learn data science, and apply concept you learn with python. 
When evaluating a function numerically we would like to sample it more densely in the interesting regions instead of evaluating it on a manually-defined homogeneous grid. Together with my colleagues, we wrote an open-source Python software package Adaptive that evaluates the function at the optimal points by analyzing existing data and planning ahead on the fly. With a few lines of code you define your goal, evaluate functions on a computing cluster, and live-plot the data. It performs averaging of stochastic functions, interpolation of vector-valued one and two-dimensional functions, and one-dimensional integration. In my work, using adaptive resulted in a ten-fold speed increase over using a homogeneous grid, going from three months on 300 cores to only a week! See (star) the repo on [github.com/python-adaptive/adaptive](https://github.com/python-adaptive/adaptive) and the documentation on [adaptive.readthedocs.io](http://adaptive.readthedocs.io). Try `pip install adaptive[notebook]` or `conda install adaptive` :-) P.S. adaptive has already been used in several scientific publications, see the [gallery](https://adaptive.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage_examples.html)! 
Also, about what happens in the plot: It is "learning" to describe the following function with the least amount of points: def ring(xy): import numpy as np x, y = xy a = 0.2 return x + np.exp(-(x**2 + y**2 - 0.75**2)**2/a**4) But the beauty is that it will work with **any** smooth function! So also for functions that I encounter in my work (in computational quantum mechanics / quantum computing). Those functions sometimes take minutes for a single point. Having 1/10th of the points to describe the same thing, is therefore extremely beneficial and has already saved **decades** of computational time!
Thank you so much! I am not familiar with the terms you have used but I will look them up.
Thank you
This is a video how google approach this problem: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0-RiOqgG68](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0-RiOqgG68) &amp;#x200B; The dataset they use is here: [https://research.google.com/audioset//index.html](https://research.google.com/audioset//index.html) &amp;#x200B; Still like other people said: Its not an easy task. I am very interested how your research is going on. Hope you can update this post!
thank you!
thank you!
thank you for the info!
Beautiful
Thank you! Have fun
That was the initial goal, [here's that frame] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaronpenne/generative_art/master/parc_pie/images/parc_pie_wannabe.png)
Did you post feature requests for the stuff you are missing?
It's a Processing file in Python mode. Amazing framework for generative art: https://py.processing.org/
I wish it would adapt to your apparent skill, though, for those of us that aren't beginners. I can't find a way to find the next puzzle that most matches what it thinks my skill level is. So instead I did a whole lot of puzzles I'd rate "Very Easy," which isn't very fun. You can sort hardest to easiest, but hardest is like Project Euler type hard. It's a huge jump.
Impressive!
Woah, this is cool. Have you guys written a paper about this?
Sorting challenges by specific difficulty is on their [roadmap](https://edabit.com/roadmap).
Checkout `pyomo`, it's a Python library for all kinds of combinatorial optimization problems. Here is a solution to the knapsack problem using `pyomo` and `glpk` as solver for the linear program. from pyomo.environ import * model = AbstractModel() model.n = Param(within=PositiveIntegers) model.I = RangeSet(1, model.n) model.w = Param(model.I) model.v = Param(model.I) model.W = Param(within=NonNegativeReals) model.x = Var(model.I, domain=NonNegativeIntegers) def obj(m): return sum(m.v[i] * m.x[i] for i in m.I) model.obj = Objective(rule=obj, sense=maximize) def constraint1(m): return sum(m.w[i] * m.x[i] for i in m.I) &lt;= m.W model.constraint1 = Constraint(model.I, rule=constraint1) instance = model.create_instance(filename='knapsack.dat') solver = SolverFactory('glpk') results = solver.solve(instance, logfile='results.log') instance.solutions.store_to(results) results.write(filename='results.json', format='json')
Well coolio then. Thanks.
We explain most of how `adaptive` works in the tutorial [here](https://adaptive.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/tutorial.html). However, we didn't write a paper on the algorithms yet, I plan to do this around August this year. Nonetheless Adaptive is still citable through [DOI:10.5281/zenodo.1182437](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1182437).
Wow! This is incredible! Well done!
That depends on how much access you are given to the host. How much are you paying for it, anyway? You can get a VPS for like $3/month.
Data
Thank you for the response, I shall do a little bit of research this afternoon and homework tonight! :) 
I dont have root access and I cant even "sudo..." . I payed ZAR1100 (South African Rand) I think thats about $80-$85
For a month of hosting? This is _ridiculously_ expensive. Why did you pick that option?
Oh No No, sorry.. its for a year &amp;#x200B;
Still, that's $7/month. That can get you a solid private server from DigitalOcean, Scaleway, OVH, Hetzner, AWS, Vultr or any other cloud infrastructure provider, and you'll have full control on that, so you'll even be able to reinstall the OS if you want.
Count me in! 
What kind of god are you?
Shit! Well I wasted a lot money.. It seems like i can only host wordpress and joomla websites on my website. But it's cool, I'll still make use of it. Next time I'll go with one of those options,I desperately need a vps 
This looks cool but I don’t understand what exactly it’s sampling. Or doing. Could you please explain?
Consider asking the company you got it from for a refund. If you haven't used it much, they can probably refund you, and you can use the money to get a VPS.
I can try, but it's godaddy

Is the methodology similar to adaptive gridding in TCAD? While the paper lacks the visuals tools from Silvaco and Synopsys have had something to this effect to increase fidelity of semiconductor device simulations for diffusion processes, amongst other physical process models, for a while. However, those aren't *generally* useful like your package. Cool stuff.
I'm guessing you also tried hitting something like the mandelbrot generator function with this? Seems perfectly set up to generate fractals more efficiently than hard calculating each pixel?
The main difference with FEM is that there you need to globally update the mesh at every time step and the updates are relatively cheap. For us, we just care about making a nice plot (using interpolation) with as little amount of points possible.
Take a look at [this](https://docs.python-guide.org) , it helped me a lot at the beginning
This would work very well for [Mandelbrot sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set), however it takes Adaptive about 50 ms to suggest a new point based on the data. Considering that the evaluation of a point in the Mandelbrot set takes a very μs, it would be smarter to just sample it on a very dense grid. If your calculation takes much longer than 50 ms, then it is very useful to use Adaptive!

I love edabit. Really helps me discover new things about the language. Most of the “very easy” ones are similar and obviously very easy lol but completing them just gives me extra practice, since I’ve only been coding for 1-2 months. Sorting by difficulty would be a good idea for the site instead of just easy/hard. Definitely a better site for beginners than some of the other “coding challenge” sites where I can’t even begin to attempt to code those problem solutions lol

I'm working on Celery 5 which will be the first version to drop Python 2.7 support and the first version to be fully async/await compatible.
I think you need to shift your attitude slightly from “I want to have a career in Python” to “I want to engineer software”. Once you do that you can have the end goal of building something is of interest to you (and your future employer). Creating software is a lot more than just knowing Python. You’ll need to know how Linux, the web, networking, UI, build systems, etc., work. And you can research this along the way to your goal. It’s great you’re learning Python directly to build foundations (and keep doing that) but think of a simple piece of software you want to create and go for it. Even if it’s a piece of crap it’s fine. You’ll learn a lot along the way and it’ll give you a codebase and piece of software to improve incrementally. Then move onto something more difficult.
I think you should try object oriented programming. Play a bit in Blender (www.blender.org), it takes all the good stuff from python. It will open up the industry for you and you might mix and match with your graphical designer career.
Edit: someone also mentioned in a previous post you can sell your skills online on a website. People ask for a certain job to be done (write a script, module, crawler,...), you can apply for it or take a look at what people/companies really need.
Okay, thank you for the response! That cleared up things in my mind a bit. I'll try to think of something or look up mock up ideas.

Another package author here. This is a really good question. Indeed there are similarities between what we do and Bayesian optimization. - The choice of new points is based on the previous ones. - There is a tuneable algorithm for performing this selection, and the easiest way to formulate this algorithm is by defining a loss function. Bayesian optimization is a perfectly fine algorithm for choosing new points within adaptive. As an experiment we have interfaced [`scikit-optimize`](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/) and implemented a learner that just wraps it. However there are important differences why Bayesian optimization doesn't cover all the needs. Often our aim is to *explore* the function and not minimize it. Further AFAIK Bayesian optimization is most often combined with Gaussian processes because it is then possible to compute the posteriour exactly and formulate a rigorous optimization strategy. Unfortunately Gaussian processes are computationally expensive and won't be useful with tens of thousands of points. `adaptive` is much more simple-minded and it relies only on the local properties of the data, rather than fitting it globally. I'd say that Bayesian modeling is good for really computationally expensive data, regular grids for really cheap data, and local adaptive algorithms forare somewhere in the middle.
Maybe figure out what kind of software engineering you want to get into. I also had a background in graphic design before coming into programming, and I started with Python. I challenged myself to put these two fields together by building a website from the ground up using Python as the back-end, as well as learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript to create the front end, and putting my graphical design to use there as well. So maybe do something like that, or any personal project that interests you but make sure it's a good learning experience.

For those wondering, this is very useful in the machine learning world, where you often have a ton of hyperparameters in your algorithm, and want to test a bunch of combinations of them to find the best one.

Your best bet, imo, if you want to use Python for a job, is either learn Django, or learn data science, e.g. Numpy, SciPy, Pandas, etc. Great Django skills and a portfolio will be enough to land you a job at a Python web dev shop. You'll almost certainly need to know front end though, unfortunately, if you go the Django route.
I'm a very beginner in python, can you please tell me what this is and maybe the source code? I really love programming and I am studying it as much as I can. Thanks
The the source code [here](https://github.com/python-adaptive/adaptive) And in the simplest terms, we just want to: * calculate our function (for example `y = x^2` for `x` between 0 and 1) * use as few points as possible to still get a smooth image * being able to access the data **while the calculation is in progess!** * do the function evaluation in parallel! (so using multiple computers/CPUs simultaneously) Hope that is easy enough, haha. If that didn't help, [see the gif generated by this code](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/files.nijho.lt/face_gif.ipynb?flush_cache=true) because it's just fun :D

&gt;if you're going to use pickle on a large scale #ಠ_ಠ
 I skimmed through the tutorial and it seems it's limited to 1D/2D. Is there a computional/mathematical difficulty in generalizing to arbitrary dimensions? This could be interesting for my work if it can be applied to functions that take high dimensional input. 
Oh I noticed you guys has an N-dimensional version, sad to hear it doesn't work as well for high dimensions :( Could still be useful when only trying to optimize a couple hyperparameters. Any indication as to why the performance doesn't translate into higher dimensions?
Ok thanks very much! It was enough and clear though. Where can I start learning Python? And how?
Also xml parsing via minidom, by far the least friendly and slowest option provided in the stdlib, and opts to list bzip2 rather than lzma Also "files handling", almost exclusively lists modules used to work on *a file*: no mention of zipfile, tarfile, or os.path (let alone pathlib).
Unfortunately, we are bounded by the [Curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality). High dimensional space is just too sparse to sample efficiently with Adaptive. However, we do have a [`LearnerND`](https://adaptive.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs.html#adaptive-learnernd) that handles learning in higher dimensional but personally, I wouldn't recommend using this in more than 4 dimensions (at least I haven't tested it) because space is too sparse. You should really see it as a way to calculate visualisable functions. So a function of 0 (averaging), 1, 2, or 3 dimensions, that you can plot. In high dimensions there is only Monte-Carlo sampling that is efficient IIUC. Of course adaptive will still be better than grid spacing, but your milage will vary in high dimensions.
This is not true, we also can handle 0D (stochastic functions where you want to average the result over many evaluations) and N-dimensions, but for reasons that I explain [here in a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b8xk3a/i_wrote_a_python_package_to_do_adaptive_sampling/ek16iea?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) it will not work extremely well for very high dimensions.

This is the answer. Python is just a means to an end, but you gotta know what the end is.
Thanks for taking a look at the code! I've just recently learned of the wonders of the `enumerate()` method. I could probably refactor some of the code that works with nutrient dicts to clean up the syntax. One thing I noticed was that in some instances I had to directly reference the original dict to change its values when it got returned, so accessing each element wasn't working for me in some cases.
Great, that was much easier than I thought it would be. This makes importing way more convenient for the user. I'll add an issue to remind myself to add docstrings as well.
Thanks for the recommendation. I've never worked with pytest (just doctest) so I'll definitely take a look into it.
Thank you! I'll read up on that.
How do you define "interesting regions"? * Regions of high frequency? * Laplace Zero Crossings? * Some automatic feature detection using machine learning? Those would be my guesses. Hope you can give me a tldr. :D &amp;#x200B;
Thank you! I've always been interested in web dev, and I've thought doing both front end and back end sounded fun, I just didnt want to get too ahead of myself in my thoughts. 
I'm curious about the relation to existing methods .. is it similar to [Importance Sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Importance_sampling) for instance, or [Information-Directed Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.5556)? It appears you take a more geometric approach. There seems to be a few of these kinds of topics around.. but I would love to read a survey about how to choose a method for a given function of interest.
This looks awesome! We have to do a project that tracks a marble in some gel, mimicking minimally invasive surgeries. So I guess my question is, does this work with live footage from a webcam?
You are customize what the algorithm finds "interesting", [see this page in the tutorial](https://adaptive.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/tutorial.custom_loss.html). By default it ([the `Learner2D` of this example](https://adaptive.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/tutorial.Learner2D.html)) looks at the gradients of a function and the area of the triangles. Basically you could probably implement all of those suggestions you have.

I dont have access to the actual files. I have so far been able to extract the upcs and combine the like upcs. But have been unable to pull the description, qty or weight from the scanned image accurately. 
Oh, sorry - I will read the tutorial more carefully! 
r/learnpython
But what is the function you want to learn? I don't quite understand. Do you think it can be used to find the position in a marble?
I've been in python for about the same time. Almost finished coding bat's challenges but that is all python 2. This seems like an upgrade for sure. 
I'm sorry, I should have been more specific. We have to do live image tracking of a marble in gel that is moving due to an external magnet. From what I can gather from the material provided, we have to keep track of the trajectory of the marble and make sure it is on track. If it is not, we have to program certain criteria to tell the motor what to do in certain situations. Do you think Adaptive would be useful for this? If not, would you be able to recommend anything to help?
Ok, your info was amazing, thanks! I have now managed to establish a database of thousands of examples of sound in an .csv file. I also copied someone's convolution neural network and added in the database, it has about 75% accuracy. Where do I go from here? How can I compare one sound to another? I wanted to maybe get a dog barking sound and differentiate it from another sound

Is this comparable to MCMC?

What kind of company uses excel and VB as their 'primary data program'? If some company did in fact use excel and VB as their primary data program why would you want to work for them? Python rocks! Definitely worth the time investment.
Text-based hangman game. It’s kicking my ass :(
You are probably looking at some kind of spectrogram calculation. But that itself can have lots of gotchas including aliasing, filter roll-off, etc. Signal processing is a **huge** field. Then, if you're looking for *exact* matches (very unlikely) you can use something like [Shazam's Algorithm](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/papers/Wang03-shazam.pdf). But if you want fuzzier matches, it is likely a machine learning problem. Of course, there is a [relevant XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1425/) (though, ironically, the task at hand in the comic is pretty easy these days)
Oh, now I understand. Unfortunately, I don't think Adaptive is useful in this case, because you are not really sampling a function. I would just look at `opencv`.
Okay, thank you so much for the advice!
Tutorials having root@:/\# screenshots are like making tower of cards videos shot by open window.
MCMC would work much better in high dimensional space, Adaptive works better in low dimensional space (`dim &lt;= 4`).
you should read this https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html
Thanks!
Why put that on the doorbell, and not in the cloud?
- Unit tests: pytest - bdd: behave - code quality: sonar cube
You mean the code?
If he did then it would work. Or just be friendly like the first guy who was understadning and helpfull, i know its simple and thats why i cant find it on google, cause i make it Harder than it is. 
You have a background in graphics. Python is used as a scripting engine behind a lot of graphical programs. If you want projects that leverage your existing knowledge (plus code that other people wrote that you can look at and learn from), try writing plugins for graphics software. For example, Gimp has a means of doing graphics effects using python plugins. Go browse through them (learn to use gimp if you haven't - useful skill). Think of an effect you liked from some other piece of software that you used, but that gimp does not implement, and have a go. Gimp is just an example. Python sits ready to use in a metric fucktonne of graphics programs. Maybe go down some rabbit holes and see what grabs you. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hUrg-Wk_EM
If you don't use the Django ORM you're kind of defeating the entire point of using Django my dude. 
Huh, why is that?
It'd be interesting if the ORM could be swapped out the same way the template system can. I appreciate this is a monumental task and unlikely to ever happen. It would be nice if the Django ORM supported composite keys, but even that seems to be a big ask when you factor in the requirement for backward compatibility.
Cool, thanks for the reply and the link to the tutorial!
This timing is really good, as I'm currently evaluating Celery vs. rq vs. huey. I've been using celery for \*years\* and I'm ready for something else. &amp;#x200B; A couple questions I haven't been able to find: &amp;#x200B; \- I use Django and I want to decouple my tasks from their callers. For example, in Django I don't want to have to import the actual tasks and I want to call them as strings. Is that possible somehow. Maybe via \`enqueue('my-task-name')\` or similar? &amp;#x200B; \- Can pipelines be stopped cleanly midway through? Say I have a scraper task that GETs a webpage and then a \`save\_to\_db\` task that is in the pipeline once the GET task completes. Say I get a 404 in the GET task. How do I abort later tasks in that pipeline? &amp;#x200B; \- Is there any monitoring system for tasks that fail? I know Celery has flower, and rq has something. Mostly, I confess, I rely on celery to email me stacktraces when something fails and that works...kinda OK. How do I monitor huey? &amp;#x200B; \- Is there a way to do bulk processing with huey? I'm thinking about something like TaskMaster: [https://github.com/dcramer/taskmaster](https://github.com/dcramer/taskmaster). &amp;#x200B; I'm still reviewing things, but any light you can shed on these issues would be super helpful. (It might not surprise you that I've got a spreadsheet going to compare features.) &amp;#x200B; Huey looks pretty great. If there are solutions for the above, I think we'll start trying it out.
You lose the Admin Interfaces, Commands almost everything that makes it more feature "rich" compared to pyramid, flask ... Anyway try websauna ;) [https://websauna.org/features.html](https://websauna.org/features.html) or be pretty on the edge and use [https://github.com/auvipy/django-sqlalchemy](https://github.com/auvipy/django-sqlalchemy) 
I came to that conclusion afterwards, that this probably isn't a python problem. It's just that I surf this sub so much that it was almost automatic to post such a question here eheh. Thanks !!
 I have, thanks! I plan on using that library for adding functionality to accept a host IP in CIDR notation and resolving the broadcast address automatically as well, but since I was already using regex to clean the MAC address I figured that a simple check of the IPv4 format would do for the time being.
Try an OCR service, there are tons online that can extract the text.
You probably want [ffmpeg](https://github.com/kkroening/ffmpeg-python), maybe with a custom filter (that you'll probably want to write in C).
That sounds interesting. Do the filters have to be written in C? Can the filters have live parameters? For example: could I manipulate any parameter of the filter with a stream of data coming from elsewhere? Or are they more of a closed black box?
The filters do have to be written in C, but you have a huge library of them available to you already. You can change the parameters of the filters on the fly from your Python code that uses ffmpeg.
Straight to the point and informative. I loved your reply. Thank you so much!
In my humble opinion the ORM is a bigger component of the Django framework than the template system. You can always swap out the various template systems or just build an rest API backed by a single page app. &amp;#x200B; The moment you stop using Djangos models though you are throwing away the most significant aspect of the API and you might as well use something else entirely.
regular expressions are almost always the second best solution

I am a beginner - as in beginning today - and the easy challenges in edabit make almost zero sense to me. BUT I WANT THEM TO. Any suggestions for someone who is LITERALLY a beginner? Thanks!
Have you ever used a framework that was agnostic to the orm it uses?
Another possible approach is to transform the *sound recognition problem* into an *image recognition problem*. From your sound, draw a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram). Then, use openCV (or any other tool) to guess the sound. Depending of the "shape" of the sound, it might work. I remember a scientific paper using this to guess the specie of a bat from a recording. For most bat species, the shape of their calls has a very unique and easily identifiable shape (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat\_species\_identification#/media/File:Keoka\_pip\_spectogram.png](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat_species_identification#/media/File:Keoka_pip_spectogram.png) ). In this paper, they were using a Hough transform to discover and characterize the calls. &amp;#x200B;

Yes, Flask. Django's value proposition is the ORM and instant Admin interface, maybe the router too, but that's just as easy in Flask.

Gotcha, thanks
Take also look at OpenCV (for Python).
oh yeah haha. Happens I guess. Thanks for that reply :D
Hi This is a one-off project rather than a full-time role. I want a Raspberry Pi-based Python script that monitors a given twitter account and posts a single reply to new tweets from that account. The script should ensure that only one reply is submitted per tweet, even if the account deletes their most recent tweet and an older tweet that already has a reply has now become the most recent again. It should be possible to define a bank of replies, from which the script randomly selects one for posting each time. The bank should support tweets that are text only as well as those that include an image. It should be possible to configure how frequently the script checks the account for new tweets. You're free to use an existing framework, permissions and copyrights allowing. The code needs to be well-written - not a hack-job. As a one-off job this is open to anyone around the world who can deliver the work to the required standard. Payment via PayPal. Please PM me with your quotes along with any relevant information on similar work. Thanks
