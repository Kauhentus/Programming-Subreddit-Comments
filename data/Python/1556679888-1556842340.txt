Great, see you there!
If you learn SQL, and databases, which are easy compared to what you're doing now, you will be making over $100,000 / year if you live in the US by the time you're 30 if you know how to market yourself, 26 if you're good at it, 36 if you're not. Learning how to market yourself is probably something you want to start mentally internalizing right now, and mentally chomping at. I mean, if you weren't 15, and unemployable, I could probably sell my boss on hiring you for about $50/hr for projects that you'd find dull. So... you feel me? Get that money.
It actually never collates. You can check the documentation. Collation is not one of its functions.
LMAO, the only thing that could be reviewed is the rendering engine part it seems you are using chromium for that so you didnt write actual code you just covered chrome with 2-3 buttons.
I know exactly what `zip` does, and I'm blowed if I can work out what the question is asking. The question is **literally** (I don't mean figuratively!) missing a clause: "Write a function to map all elements of the same index for the following list." Precisely as u/the_television asks, "Map them to what?" Using the required output list, I would say that I don't need to write a function, since `zip` already handles that situation: py&gt; list(zip(*[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])) [(1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (3, 6, 9)] If you care that they are tuples instead of lists, post-process with `map(tuple, ...)`.
zip maps lists elements by pairing objects according to index. So the notion of "mapping" with zip is to take an input and join any elements with the same index. As I said, if you know what zip does it's quite clear what it would mean to map an input using zip. The fact that the person also tells you what end result they mean for you to get just makes this doubly clear.
Go for it Andy!
Great job! Make a github, and post it up there. Also, you can use screen2gif to make animated gifs of your projects for more effective sharing. Age is no limit, this is cooler than things I've done that I'm impressed with, and I'm in my 30s. Don't be down on yourself. This is really cool!
Hey, I’m a college student in SoCal and I know about databases. Care to talk about a possible internship? I got a sick resume.
Sidebar: &gt; If you are about to ask a "how do I do this in python" question, please try r/learnpython, the Python discord, or the #python IRC channel on FreeNode.
PM me you're resume, but as an FYI I have a friend with a PhD that I'm trying to get a project for for experience. However, I can give you tips on how to market yourself / get experience --&gt; which you seem to be doing a good job of. I started by working for free and just begging to find someone to give me (1) SQL reference. After that getting a job was easy, and from there my hunger and interest in the broader field just helped me grow into a career that I never expected. It's not that difficult, but the marketing side is the tricky part.
Yes its a Chrome based browser, the Chrome bit is used for requesting sites.
Any chance you have a repo of this or feel like sharing? This is great!
Don't be a dick. [That other post][1] is probably actually be a 15 year old. We don't need this kind of negativity on /r/python. [1]: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/bj8pi2/i_turned_15_today_so_i_made_this_perspectivebased/
I did a similar thing but in Java. Sourcecode: [https://github.com/npetrangelo/3rd-Dimension](https://github.com/npetrangelo/3rd-Dimension)
Could be due to faulty indentation. Make sure all the class functions are a tab indent to the right from where the class definition begins. I like to use the tab key instead of just spaces for this. Whichever one you use is up to you but be consistent with it. Mixing them can lead to issues like this.
Could you post the console output alongside the relevant snippet of code?
Just fixed it, turns out I saved two identical files and have been editing the wrong one, soo yea
Any big opportunities in companies that don't have shady business practices and don't contract with the military?

This is really good. If you are planning to become a game developer at some point, this is a great start.
My 16 birthday I made a TicTacToe game
That's web "scrapping" :)
&gt; companies that don't have shady business practices I'm sorry, but do you know how companies operate? Do you want to work, or starve? Find something you care about in your 40s.
Yes, I know how companies operate, and I'm not a fan. That's the problem. I'd like to have a voice in whatever I make and I don't want my work to aid in hurting anyone in any way.

This is great and you should be proud. Don’t be afraid of using libraries though. Writing things from scratch can sometimes be a worse use of time than using a library. For stuff like this though, I’m sure you learned a ton which is valuable in its own rite.
 I would say that programming may not be for you then, the corporate side of things will for the vast majority of the time overrule anything you think should be there for the good of others (Unless law states they have to and there is no way around it). Corporate thinks in terms of money not better good for people using their items (Besides obviously if Law is in the way).
You're 15. Read the things I wrote and start to mentally chew on them. I felt like that 15. At 36, I wish I had started thinking about these things earlier and learning how to pimp the system for myself. If you want to have a voice in something, then have the skills &amp; talent to be able to stand up and be that person in 20 years. You're gonna have to eat a lot of shit to get there, and if you think you aren't, and you're going to do it all your own way like I did... you're going to end up eating twice as much shit.
You sound like a massive dick, and I don’t mean that in a BDE way.
Not sure why you’re getting downvoted by what I assume are grown men. This is really good and you’re already further along than most teens.
Not to completely demerit the effort, but this comes off as "hey look at what I did...and I'm barely 15. Isn't that impressive?"
Would you please elaborate on the "to not be a jerk" part? Is it to not hog their website hosting services? Sorry if this is a stupid question

I am. I really am. Kind of get off on it. Lots of people I work with absolutely hate me. I don't have a lot of friends either. Quality over quantity, unless it comes to dolla, dolla, bills, yo. That's what my daddy always used to say.
It gives the input and expected output. Even if literally nothing else was written that should be enough to write a function.

Thank you all for commenting and making this an engaged discussion.
For 1: All of your methods need to return self.value Not value As for your attribute issue, how are you instantiating the class and then how are you calling it? Eg. new_instance = MyClass(params) new_instance.method_call()
Taking the contents of an Excel spreadsheet and converting it to XML.
I hate to break it to you, but if you know "SQL" and "Databases" and if you "live in the US" and if "you know how to market yourself" and if "you're good at it" you can make 100k annualized as an **18 year old** intern -- **no need to wait** till you're 26 or 30, and sign fulltime out of college **much, much closer** to that 200,000 at **21** rather then at 40. Source: Facebook/Amazon intern salaries and new grad offers P.S. you dont seem to have BDE but ur still a bit of a dick
That really isn't the reality of the job market. Kids graduating college generally get seduced into a job making around 50-60k a year, and end up staying in that job for about 5-6 years until they take another job making 70-80k/year. &gt;Source: Facebook/Amazon intern salaries and new grad offers You're talking about new grads from a select group of schools, not the average. For everyone else, in most other markets, that isn't how things work. But, hey, follow your sources. I work for a F500 staffing company that does business in over 100 countries.
50-60k is what my dad made for SQL in the 80s. Probably less.
Sounds great. Can you share the code?
Is it pronounced deck or de-queue?
I'd like to think I would have done the same thing when I was 15 if Python and YouTube math videos had been around. I certainly wanted to.
That's the going rate for entry level analytics positions. The high end jobs pay about $500+/hr. Did your dad ever make $250/hr? I have. Maybe your dad's doctor, or his lawyer made that much... if they're good ones. Cambridge Analytica charged the Trump campaign 36 million dollars for services rendered. Go ahead and divide that number by whatever hourly rate you want to assume and see if you think they actually worked that number of hours. Analytics is a different kind of game, and if you're young and talented then pay attention and focus. I can hire full stack developers out of India for cheap, but my boss can't replace me with ten others. Pay attention to the keywords I'm using, or don't. I don't give a fuck. I started out at 60k/year with full benefits. Actually I started out working for free and graduated to that. But hey, do your own thing, boo. Good luck with your degree, and lack of marketability. Let me know how the first 8 years of your professional career turn out once you graduate. Why don't you ask your dad to read what I'm saying and have him give you his opinion? Or are you afraid of that? #realtalk
Lmao big mad
Good question. Not sure mate !!
I’m 19 and am currently finishing my freshman year majoring in Software Engineering.
And so's your dad for raising you. https://i.imgflip.com/1o78ln.jpg LOL @ "my dad made" -- [Get a job hippie](https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/29006175/get-a-job-hippie.jpg)

“Deck”
This is random but I feel like you could have some good input: I just got a warning at work for job performance (I’m a data software engineer) How do I turn this around in the upcoming weeks and get my act together? Or make it seem that way? My boss smells bullshit a mile away so pretty talking won’t help. Have to deliver.
Congrats dude! Happy birthday! Stick with it!
I use fairly standard stuff - python, Jupyter, pandas etc. for analysis. I use metabase for dashboards and sharing data with the wider team. Check out some of my previous posts for other stuff I've written - I'm part way through a series on Python for Product Managers, and any feedback is welcome!
Then start thinking about what I'm saying and chewing on the idea of marketing yourself. Companies are gonna company. Universities gonna university. You're paying a lot of money to university... and you don't want to company? Kinda sounds dumb. I get it. I was your age. Really wish I could punch my younger self in the face.
When I was about 15 I did something similar but it was just displaying a static perspective cube with BASIC on a Commodore 64. Quicker feedback would have helped my understanding immensely! Nice!
Pragmatism is partly a self-fulfilling prophecy. Priorities like mine are impractical because each generation is told that until they believe it too. However, if everyone was naive in the same way, perhaps it would not be so naive after all.
+1 for 'deck' Raymond Hettinger calls it 'deck' as well so that's a good start.
Good to know !!!
Get another job, and get serious about shit. I dunno. Were you expecting better advice? &gt;Or make it seem that way? Do I strike you as the type of asshole who can't smell bullshit a mile away? Do I strike you as someone who didn't get serious about shit a long time ago? Get your shit together. This is exactly what you were expecting me to say, isn't it?
Well, it is. I think it's an awkward teenager trying to be proud of something he made. Cut him some slack.

Systematically identified all polling places in the state of North Carolina for the 2018 midterm election. Long story short, I put them on [a map along with a bunch of other information.](https://fiveham.github.io/NC-Elections/all-districts.html?pp&amp;layer=congress) Also, just tonight I checked the live [election results thing for NC's third congressional district](https://er.ncsbe.gov/?election_dt=04/30/2019&amp;county_id=0&amp;office=FED&amp;contest=1002) on a timer and saved the info every time it changed. Wanted to make a sort of livestream map to watch the results trickle in. The map part didn't work out, but having a sequence of real updates like this will let me simulate that sort of a streamlike thing in the future for testing purposes.
Good luck.
I tried to write something similar in college but it took a while for me to figure out the math. I did eventually get it right after cheating and taking a look at [Glenn Murray's website.](https://sites.google.com/site/glennmurray/Home/rotation-matrices-and-formulas/rotation-about-an-arbitrary-axis-in-3-dimensions) I put my code on [a Github repository](https://github.com/ChrisCalderon/PyShapes), which I've since moved to [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/ChrisCalderon/pyshapes). I have some videos of it on my old [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ_sKYu563L9g6SpSmdW89A). Only the last video actually show the perspective projection working. Getting perspective projection working all on your own is pretty impressive to me!
This. I've never understood the "my code is too ugly to share" mindset. You don't improve without making mistakes and getting feedback and criticism.
I would say this is a great baby step. It's cool but to be a game developer, or any kind of developer really, takes more than just being able to understand the concepts involved. You have to read docs, read code, learn frameworks, IDEs, etc. Understanding the concepts is like 20% of the work, and it's the most interesting part. The rest is the "legwork" of gaining a working/practical knowledge of the systems you use to build your product.
Age is definitely relevant. I didn't start learning to code until I was 18! You guys have huge head starts. My advice is to at least read SICP, that was hugely enlightening to me when I was starting out.
Wrote a few scrapers that together monitors the entire powergrid of a country. Then help people who experience lengthy power outages get money back from their company. Successfully made back over $4000 to people through the initial testing phase. As I just picked up programming about six months ago, its definitely the coolest thing I've ever done.
Never a dumb question! Yes, to prevent spamming their site with 4 page views * 500 stocks. Always good manners.
Not the above poster but that's generally the case. It good practice not to slam someone's website with a ton of requests as it will slow it down or cost more to run.
Anyone taking this course right now?
Happy birthday :)
cProfile has too much overhead for anything but toy code, and its overhead tends to be higher for some types of code than others, skewing the results. If you need to profile production code, use a stack sampling profiler, like PLOP or PyFlame.
Package developers don't generally use C extensions unless they have to. They'd only usually do so if pure Python would be unacceptably slow, or if they're interfacing with a library written in another language. There might be a few cases of modules that interface with external C libraries, that could be ported to use ctypes (at the cost of performance), but mostly stuff that's in C needs to be.
 import ast results = [] with open('output.txt', 'r') as f: lines = f.readlines() for line in lines: line = line.strip() if line.startswith("{") and line.endswith("}"): line = ast.literal_eval(line) results.append(line) print(results) print(type(results[0])) [{'Jim': 45, 'Paul': 94, 'Jess': 66}, {'Tim': 69, 'Pat': 66, 'Patty': 80}] &lt;class 'dict'&gt; ---- output.txt {'Jim': 45, 'Paul': 94, 'Jess': 66} {'Tim': 69, 'Pat': 66, 'Patty': 80} rm -rf /

I would probably go with something like this if possible. It also gives you the added bonus of being a legit data format that you can import else where or work with programmatically to clean up the source data or otherwise process it further.
Great job and happy birthday!
Still working on my master thesis while working a full time job. The thesis is about customer churn prediction within the company I work at so it is pretty interesting to work on something useful. Yesterday I started to work on a script to scrape real estate data but got stuck at step 1: getting the data. I use request to get website data. But the page was generated in JavaScript which only gave me JS tags. However I got some tips on Reddit I need to try tonight
Made a script to scrape every job listing on asurion for a certain job i've been waiting to open up. It goes through every job details page on the list of like 27 pages(or however many there is) of jobs looking for the keyword. If it finds the result, it sends a notification to my phone using pushbullet. Made it for fun really.
I will sure do! The code is not very great and this is the only way I could get actual feedback
Thanks!
Thank you
Thanks! I usually use Unity, but this was just a break from pre-made software, I tried to make my own from scratch
Hey, that reminds me of the polygon mesh I was making around your age in Turbo Pascal*! The next step is bacface culling to make the polygons that face away from you disappear and get a more solid looking cube. Then perhaps sorting the polygons by distance (projected z coordinate) and filling them. Also, listen to the comments about putting your code on github. Not so much for the feedback as for getting used to source control.
Thanks!
That's impressive! Thanks for sharing
Pretty nice :D Does it load a mesh from a standardized format or do you have to hardcode it in?
Thank you
When i was 15 i started using blender. This kid is going places.
Thanks! I didn't use fancy formulas. I tried to bring it down to the math I learn in school. The image you see is a plane, and I imagine a line that connects every vertex to a point behind the plane (the camera). All I did was calculate the intersections of those lines with the view plane
Wikipedia.
Thank you! I know using a library would have been easier. My goal wasn't actually to display something in 3D, it was to understand the concepts of perspective and do it all on my own
Unfortunately screenshots are generally much more accessible and convey more information for everyone else. A link in the comments would be a better solution.
Not sure I understand the question. AFAIK Github doesn't have any integrated nbdime, so no, if you inspect "on github", you won't get anything helpful. But, you can just inspect them locally on any machine with nbdime (and the proper VCS integration configured), whether the repo is hosted on GitHub or anywhere else…
True. But legwork is there in every line of work. So might as well have the legwork that comes with the most enjoyable conceptual work.
What's wrong with that? I think this is impressive for any new programmer, even more so one who isn't even college age.
The original projects last commit was four years ago. It was written in python2 with flask, and provided a web interface for converting links into webarchive links. The whole idea based around preventing link rot. I switched some print statements, and as far as I can tell it's working in python3 now. I also added a script that takes some command line options. Figured it's more scriptable that way. If you have any suggestions, or contributions I'd love to hear them
And it's absolutely great.
And what's wrong with that? I mean, if he is proud of doing amazing things while being this young, he is in his right to say his age. In the end he is almost a child. Instead of being jealous of him or whatever, just congratulate him and that's it. You have been a teen too once, don't forget it.
Can you share your code?
What's wrong with wanting attention for something you did? Sheesh.
I will, soon! But you have to prepare yourself for headaches before trying to read it!
You got me!
He is right to say his age for adding a context. He wouldn't get the same personal advices if he was a 35-years-old engineer than if he is just a high school student. Honestly I don't get the point of those of you who get offended by him for saying his age. Jealousy? Don't be childish.
No problem 😂
Thanks! I am looking forward to adding backface culling. And I will publish it on Github soon
Sure thing man thanks!!
I manually made an array of vertices and lines. It's not my favorite part - I will probably make a wavefront importer or something because I feel like typing coordinates and numbers and getting them right isn't really my thing
Matey, the whole point of this notebooks is for sharing. Taking a screenshot really negates their beauty.
And in 1 day too it seems
Made an Instagram bot to find interesting images and posts and to comment on them so I don't have to spend lots of time liking and commenting on amazing posts or images. Also used the bot to gather some data about followers.
I see, yeah wouldn't be my thing either :D I toyed with the idea of writing a renderer of some sort for a while now and I think stl would be fairly easy to read an convert. It's essentially the coordinates of vertices and how they're connected.
&gt; The code is not very great So many people mistakenly decide not to share something because they have this limiting belief that it's not good enough. But the reality is that the only person you hurt by not sharing is your future self. The critical feedback you can obtain from sharing is far more valuable than any shame you might feel because your code isn't perceivably perfect.
Update: I uploaded the code on GitHub. Check it out here: [https://github.com/Forfunckle/python-3d-renderer](https://github.com/Forfunckle/python-3d-renderer)

Why are you telling us this?

Mission accomplished!
Good job man coding at a Jong age like that. And a happy birthday
Curl? Not requests?
yes but now working to replace curl to use requests and it will be done this week
What formuals would you have to come up with? A quick google search does the trick?
Well done!
Not really, he found it hilarious when someone eventually told him. It was a lot of fun tbh
If by revealing their age (to get attention, or etc) encourage more kids to be creative and more courageous to reveal their works, then I'm all for it. I deal with kids/teenagers daily and I'd say this is brag-worthy even.
Don't let negative feedbacks make you anxious or hinder you to be creative.
&gt; The OP is right to say his age for adding a context. He wouldn't get the same personal advices if he was a 35-years-old engineer than if he is just a high school student. This is a python sub, not r/LifeAdvice His age is wholly irrelevant. What's more, it can prompt resurgences in those idiotic memes where people continuously post things like "I'm 4 years old and I built this linear accelerator". &gt;Honestly I don't get the point of those of you who get offended by him for saying his age. Jealousy? Don't be childish. It's not being childish. Anonymous internet communities are balanced on a knife edge. It takes almost no effort to transform into a cess pit like 4chan. The *entire point* of an ostensibly self-governing community like reddit is to establish norms. Because we have comments like this, we can't have norms. We have to have *rules*. And rules suck. This isn't gym class - participation is not the most important part of the activity. If you want to be a mentor, go to /r/learnpython
Like I said, I think it's a cool project. I'd like to at least move it over to python3, but there's probably a lot of intricacies of doing that that I'm not aware of. Plus I'm always looking to improve myself. I guess I'm just looking for something to work on
Hey man it's great, especially considering your age. One thing I will recommend for you, which will help your future self and people you work with/anyone who will work on your code base, is more descriptive variable names, rather than zk, yk etc do something like zCam, a bit like you have done with the rotation variables, they are good. Also more comments, I like to comment sections into my code to give a brief description of what I'm about to do and sometimes a quick explanation of how I do it. Also in your function, after declaring it, a quick multi line comment is PEP standard, just to explain what that function does and what params it takes and what it returns. By no means is your work there bad, I think it's great. You just got to work on best practices now, that's what will set you apart in the future, cause your logic is pretty sound, hope this helps! Also, it's nice to see more younger people getting into programming, i started when I was 13 myself and I've never lost my love for it!
Whose turn?
I like how it looks vaguely like an optical illusion. Good work!
Thank you so much for your advice
Good work as you're young you may not be self aware of some things. One of the good advice that was already mentionned, is that you're not alone. In one of my first job my manager told me that i have to code as if i will be struck by a truck and die tomorow. Because what is very valuable is not to do amazing things but that people can interact with it and understand it. &amp;#x200B; Beetween a code coder but nobody understand him and an average coder that everyone understand his code the average one will oftend be choose. &amp;#x200B; Keep up the good work :)
I have the code in Try and except block in case if I get the Key error I have the code in expect block to run. Though it gives me an error any suggestion?
Hey man! This is lovely. The best things about your code is: It's very intuitive and you made it using school math. Your logic is really impressive. Visual app opens many doors to better understanding. Here is a library by Grant Sanderson, the creator of The YouTube channel 3 BLUES 1 BROWN https://github.com/3b1b/manim I think you will like it. Great work buddy and happy birthday.
Cockmites turn!
No problem mate
Wow you really have feelings about this whole thing.
Thank you! I will check it out
I have built an alerting API that can be called to display the major market share changes for specific products across different regions. Next step is to build a program that will build URL's based off of the alert trees that this API returns. Using these URL's we can build presentations as this analytics website has integration with Google Slides.
Hey great stuff. My recommendation is to wrap everything in functions, the make a main function that runs all the other functions in order. Then run the main function under a if __name__ == "__main__": Line. So much easier to read when I'm looking at descriptive function names.
Project is not done yet as I'm waiting for data gathering to have enough data. Scraping the local meteorological homepage for rain radar, temperature, clouds, winds at 10m and winds at 1000m images to train some machine learning model to predict rain locally, as the current predictions for 5,10,30 minutes are not that good. No idea if I can do better but it's a fun project. So far i have 7 months worth of images at 5 minute intervals. I'm aiming at at least a years worth of data to at least have data for all seasons, maybe longer when i see how it goes. I also collect their predictions to compare against/as a baseline.
When I said "personal advice" I meant advice based on his personal skills and context: a 15 years old teen who seems to be starting in programming. That's it. Plus, he mentioned his age just one time, while the rest of time he has been talking about his code, not bragging about how much genius he might be or not. It's just some extra bit of naive data that makes most of people to feel more curious about his Python project. Take it easy, man, it's not a drama if a teen takes 3 words of space to mention his age. Really, it's okay.
Hey, just to let you know that your examples will all be supported in the next version (already on github) apart from the last INDEX which gives me a #REF! even in excel so I'm not quite sure about. Thanks a lot!!! This really helped me improve what I had.
I understood that reference.
Thanks for this amazing code. I know you probably are not expecting this but I am 15 also. I have been trying to find libraries that would help me do 3d rendering with pictures of a face. Looking at the simplicity of the code you made me realize that it would not be that hard to build a 3d renderer for a face. Impressive work with the code
Collates is the wrong word? Fair enough, I accept that. I misspoke. How about collects? Assembles? Folds together? Places together? Merges? Sticks items together? Gathers into tuples? Whatever term you use for grabbing items out of **one or more** (not merely two) iterables and sticking them into a tuple, which is then yielded, its pretty clear that (1) `zip` works on more than two objects ((it takes an arbitrary number of arguments) and (2) its not matching up indices. It even works on objects which aren't indexable at all, like iterators.
Thanks! And no problem :)
It can help manipulate images
it is an actively maintained fork of PIL (Python Image Library)
Can you share the code
That’s pretty cool to know. Thanks a lot!
 print('Sum of digits =', sum([int(i) for i in str(n)]))
&gt; Even if literally nothing else was written that should be enough to write a function. If and when you, as a professional programmer, have to deal with incomplete specifications and poorly described functional requirements, you too will learn to **hate having to guess what the requirements are**. Example input/output is fantastic for clarifying the meaning of the requirements, but they aren't a substitute for explaining the requirements correctly in the first place. An example alone allows you to write an infinite number of functions, since without a specification but only a single example (and a pretty limited one at that) we might guess all sorts of requirements: def function(arg): a, b, c = arg[:3] return [ [x+2*i for i, x in enumerate(a)], [x-2+2*i for i, x in enumerate(b)], [x-4 + 2*i for i, x in enumerate(c)] ] gives exactly the output requested with the given input.

Did you try doing some work with Google Colab? I know it's not exactly what you are looking for but maybe it will help you with some tasks.
&gt; if you know what zip does it's quite clear what it would mean to map an input using zip. The question doesn't say "map an input using zip" is says **Write a function to map all elements of the same index for the following list.** `zip` isn't mentioned, and the sentence isn't even complete. Map all elements to **what**? Letters of the alphabet? Prime numbers? Map coordinates? As you've been told at least twice now, by two different people, the problem here is that the question as written doesn't make sense without the input/output example. Its a poorly written question. As I pointed out [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/bj20h0/power_of_zip_in_python/em7tjdj/), having to infer or guess the behaviour from an example means you can guess wrong. Congratulations on being able to infer *one possible* meaning of the question from the given input/output. That puts you in the top 99% of the class. But the question as given is still missing a clause, it doesn't specify what is supposed to happen except by a single example, and a well-written question in a tutorial shouldn't require the reader to *infer* the meaning of the question.
Just try to imagine there's one package in Python dealing with virtual environments and nobody even thinks about making another one.
This is "shorter" but not "faster".
Congrats man! Keep working hard, and don't think you peaked yet or anything! As you get older you will have less time for your hobbies, not more. You'll likely get a family, and it will consume alot of that at least when they are young. So work hard and keep up the excellent work, very impressive!
this is what competent recruiters look for at companies. keep up this enthusiasm/passion in your projects and you wont have anything to worry about cheers
You should use the Code Block markup instead of `Inline Code`. &amp;#x200B; Save YOURONEDRIVEUSERNAME as a variable and build the URL with it instead of forcing us to replace it manually. YOURONEDRIVEUSERNAME = "liebensraum" URL = "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/{user}/drive/root:/fotos/HouseHistory".format(user=YOURONEDRIVEUSERNAME)
I guess it depends on what type of work you are doing. If you are in the business analytics/ data analysis space you may consider using notebooks as the combination of markdown and visual outputs of code can be made to look quite professional. Other people should be able to work with the markdown of note books even if they don't know python. If you find yourself doing the same thing over and over again in powerpoint then you may want to knock out some code using that library to automate. For example if you want your clients to see a weekly status update ppt deck you can probably control updating it each week all thru python. If you want to create the deck for the very first time, maybe not, maybe then it is easier to work in Powerpoint first.
You could be surprised. Time it!
I did [something similar](https://imgur.com/TrFP7rp) for renaming and mailing our invoices to our accounting program. I spend more time on the CLI than the rest of the script. The colors do look a bit dull though, is there a way to increase the brightness? I did this with termcolor btw. Will take a look at Colorama.
I'm not sure that this is correct? From my understanding, that future import merely enables postponed evaluation; the type annotations must still be `typing` based to be properly supported by mypy.
It hasn't been updated in 4 years because it's not a good project at all, python is far from being the best way for applying this concept, I thought it would at least automate
cockmite
Great! I saw the code on GitHub and it seems very good. Next step: improve it with objects (classes in Python are very easy and useful, even if you are a beginner) so that your code could be reused by others easily.
I made a script to take a folder full of images and crop/resize them so they are square and approx. 5cm x 5 cm when printed on A4. I use that to prepare photos for reports, save loads of time and reduces the size of the reports (Using Microsoft Word)... &amp;#x200B; Github: [https://github.com/adamrees89/ReportPhotos](https://github.com/adamrees89/ReportPhotos)

You should definitively use a library to read SDF files. In addition to the already mentioned openbabel, you can also use [chemfiles](chemfiles.org). (Full disclaimer, I am the original author of chemfiles) Reading a file and getting a distance can be done like this: from chemfiles import Trajectory file = Trajectory(“file.sdf”) frame = file.read() # access positions as a numpy array frame.positions # get the distance between atoms, with periodic boundary conditions d = frame.distance(2, 56)
Good job !
Some people just can't bare the thought of being criticized or judged.
Let me know what you think!

why not just use JSON? &amp;#x200B; it's very similar, but standard, safe and you don't have to build the strings yourself, can use existing libraries to serialize/deserialize

I prefer GUI web browsers at least.
interesting, but I can't understand why you would do this
It actually creates one of the features of [AnyAPI](https://github.com/FKLC/AnyAPI). AnyAPI depends on chainable calls and IMO it looks better so I thought people might be like to use it. So I make an another library to let others achieve same with ease.
Yeah, of course that sucks. But we’re also talking about a simple article here. No reason to get so upset. Plus, it’s pretty clear, honestly. You get the input and output, and it even says to do it “based on the above learnings”. Since the only thing we discussed is zip() clearly you have to use that. But once again I feel the need to reiterate the fact that this doesn’t really even warrant discussion. I only chimed in because I was so surprised such a debate was even happening in the comments.
Thanks so much! I'll see if I can figure it out this week
Thanks for the advise! Yeah everyone says the file format looks obnoxious. I'll see if I can figure it out this week
You'd be better off using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org), where you can use Markdown to create slide decks, including PowerPoint, pretty trivially BUT. You might actually be better off learning PowerPoint if other people are expecting it and you're not in a position to get them to change. You could easily lose more time in coordinating with people who expect slide decks to work a certain way then you will save in not using PowerPoint.
Thanks! I'll give it a try!
what were the tips?
 `defaultdict(partial(next, count(1)))`
Really good work dude. When I was 15, Python was just a big snake for me who the Nat Geo and Discovery guys kept catching from homes in th US.
Thanks! Yeah I've used the graphical interface for openbabel (and the docking program I use relies heavily on it), but didn't even think of seeing if this was something open babel could do on its own. Thanks!
Thanks for your advise! I'll give it a shot!
Awesome! Thanks! I'll give it a try! Had no idea there would be so many options out there for this besides writing something from scratch
`defaultdict(count(1).__next__)` works too.
Hey me 2
 elastic_url = "https://"+f'{elastic_url}' Is the f string not a bit redundant here?
True. This was written by Mark Hammond, though. Big props https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/biwat9/comment/em44xsd
State of the sub.
As a general rule I avoid any of the "hidden" attributes or magic functions, but in this case it would indeed save you the partial import so... whichever I suppose!
Where are you learning
Looking up formulas is one thing, implementing the algorithms in code when you're not familiar with them to begin with is something else.
Nice! So, yeah, the only one-liner I was able to come up with was using the count generator from itertools, although I had done it like zergling\_Lester below, by passing `count(1).__next__`. I've learned more functional programming since then, but it didn't occur to me that Python might have a 'partial'!
&gt;zCam z_cam
Two lines including the import: from collections import defaultdict d = defaultdict(lambda c=[0]: c.append(c.pop() + 1) or c[0]) Cheeky one-liner: d = __import__("collections").defaultdict(lambda c=[0]: c.append(c.pop() + 1) or c[0]) I’m sure there’s better ways.
Happy birthday

Lemme hit you with that feel good upvote. Front page should be about the feel goods, the rest can be about the language.
Good one! I would say that imports from standard library modules don't count as "lines" for the definition of one-liner, so yeah, that's a one-liner either way. I did have the solution using a default argument to save the state, but I hadn't managed to beat lambda into working with this!
In my opinion, no. It is better to make your charts and animations using matplotlib, then drop them into PowerPoint. You don't want to be fighting organizational inertia. It's a waste of energy.
Yup for sure in which server?
Did some basic timing in a Jupyter notebook using `%timeit` and got this OP's version: Run 1: 379 µs ± 24.2 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each) Run 2: 359 µs ± 18.6 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each) /u/hopemeetme's version: Run 1: 365 µs ± 21.7 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each) Run 2: 350 µs ± 8.96 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each) So there's no actual difference.
`def f(_=[0]):` `_[0] += 1` `return _[0]` &amp;#x200B; `d=defaultdict(lambda: f())` I can not figure out how to make this one line lambda
why? I use it as [**formatted string**](https://docs.python.org/3.6/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings)
json is much safer. At this point it's best to just never use eval
Thank you for taking the time to post this! Very helpful.
I'm not sure why you would consider python-pptx to be a replacement solution for Microsoft Powerpoint. &amp;#x200B; From my experience using python-pptx, it is a great tool if you want to apply batch transformations to a large number of slides/presentations or want to automate part of your production process (always have a title at location x, y with formatting z or take elements of a text file and put them into slides with basic formatting...). Basically, python-pptx let's you easily manipulate the main objects (Placeholder, Text, Image) that are available to you in a PowerPoint presentation through python by parsing the underlying XML. &amp;#x200B; However, as soon as you'll try to do more complex operations, you'll soon hit a wall because the underlying XML is a clusterf\*ck. For instance, there are at least 5 different ways to specify the color of a text object and each can override the other in certain conditions. There are many other issues such as coordinates: its an MS specific format and how are you going to find the right coordinates without an IDE to immediately visualize the result? &amp;#x200B; Powerpoint is really not hard to use, and doing it the layout using its IDE will be much more productive than trying to replicate it using python-pptx.

What I think? I THINK that you make me feel stupid. That's what.
/u/yawpitch did! Also, if not trying for a one-liner, you don't need the lambda... `defaultdict(f)` will do.
Understanding the distributions model certainly makes it easier to debug what's gone wrong when something breaks due to it. It also helps you evaluate whether the tradeoffs of e.g. hash pinning are worth it. We can also try to fix things! I'm hopping to find the time this week to work on a pip PR to not try to download new distributions in hash pinning mode.
You should look into using MSS with openvs
I just thought you could write it like: elastic_url = f'https://{elastic_url}'
No, it's stop the script (and thus the time.sleep) for the time it's in sleepmode. &amp;#x200B; Blatantly copying an answer from [Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-happens-to-a-running-Python-script-if-the-computer-sleeps-shuts-down-hibernates): &amp;#x200B; [*Haider Ma*](https://www.quora.com/profile/Haider-Ma)*, studied Software Engineering* *A Python Script is practically just another program like file explorer, or chrome browser or network manager ..etc.* *Sleep is a low power mode where programs do not execute or consume CPU power, but their state is saved in memory so that when you turn it back on it can get back (or attempt to get back) to whatever state it was it .* *So say you have the following program :* import time for i in range (1,100): print (i) time.sleep(4) *when you execute this, and put you computer to sleep, and wait for a little while and turn it back on, you will notice that the execution will start from where it left off (i added time delay to give a chance for the user to notice that execution will stop when computer sleeps).*
oh cool, this was one of the only times that mutable default arguments did something that didn't frustrate me
If multiple imports are allowed then I’d say the `defaultdict(partial(next, count(1)))` route is the best option, as mine is really being a bit of a jerk with mutable defaults.
And idea how to use \_\_iadd\_\_ in a lambda function?
btw, we can make `count` ourselves too, we have the technology! defaultdict((i + 1 for i, _ in enumerate(type('', (), {'__getitem__': lambda x, y: 0})())).__next__)
That's not the answer to op's question, sleep in that code is arbitrary and it's used just as a helper to compensate speed of the for loop. The answer to op question is yes as nothing else makes sense.
Wait no!
I'd agree about `partial(next, count(1))` being best (cleanest), although this puzzle is more about exploring the different ways you can encapsulate state to persist between invocations of a callable in Python, and mutable defaults absolutely qualify. Just because using them was not an intentional feature of the language doesn't mean that it isn't a valid. This kind of thing is what's called a [spandrel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandrel_%28biology%29) in architecture and biology... kind of an emergent feature.
I follow the CS:GO esports scene and like to keep up with tournament schedules. In recent years this has been more difficult because various tournament organizers have signed exclusivity deals with non-Twitch platforms like YouTube gaming and Facebook. The best place to see all the upcoming matches and a ton more info is on hltv.org. You can see a list of upcoming matches [here](https://www.hltv.org/matches). Unfortunately they don't provide a way to set reminders/notifications or even export the match list. This makes it REALLY hard to keep up with tournaments going on around the globe at different times. I wrote a script that scrapes the matches page for a specific event, supports basic filters(like number of 'stars' and ignoring placeholder matches) that then generates a .ics file that I import in to my Google Calendar. [Here's an image of the HLTV matches page for IEM Sydney](https://i.imgur.com/FcwKPZj.png) [Here's an image of the CLI output](https://i.imgur.com/dXxu9SA.png) [And here's an image of my Google Calendar after importing the .ics](https://i.imgur.com/W44NisZ.png) Things on my "TODO when the script gets annoying enough to use" are: Automatically importing the .ics using Google's libraries, including the unique match ID in the event so it can be updated by the script.
it will not working
Two lists are circularly identical if they contain the same elements in the same order when rotated. [ 'a', 'b', 'c'] is circularly identical to ['c', 'a', 'b'], but not circularly identical to ['c', 'b', 'a']. Think of the lists arranged around the edge of two wheels. If you can rotate one wheel such that the two lists are identical given the same starting point (say the 12 o'clock position), then they are circularly identical.
I was a dragonborn in my previous life, I think.
Those are different standards. He was talking about Pep-257.
&gt;You should look into using MSS with opencv &amp;#x200B; Thank you so much for suggesting, I'll definitely look into this.
It is the answer to ops question.
Love this! I modified your code a bit to export to a gif \[Imgur\]([https://i.imgur.com/Us2gJX7.gifv](https://i.imgur.com/Us2gJX7.gifv))
Yes, but I did say 'without meta-programming', exactly for that reason, so that disqualifies this is a one-liner solution. Thanks for showing us how to do it, though!
 defaultdict(lambda x=enumerate(iter(int, 1)): next(x)[0] + 1)
&gt;sum but sum is a built-in function
Great code though.
Keep at it and when your my age , you’re gonna be unstoppable at python. I wish I started earlier
I'm working with python pptx at the moment and I have to say it's incredibly limiting. Unless you have outside influences forcing you to produce pptx files exactly, I'd recommend using another solution. No disrespect to the developer of python-pptx, its a nightmare of a file structure, but there's so many better alternatives to programmatically generating presentations
&gt; He wouldn't get the same personal advices if he was a 35-years-old engineer than if he is just a high school student. wtf you guys surely are some realistic people that either look down on 35 years old people or expecting too much from them judgement, judgement everywhere be handsome, be pretty, be confident in public speaking at 10, yea good already a world level pianist at 10, genius able to cook good food at 10, genius able to swim to compete at olympic level at 10, genius able to name every sport cars in the world at 10, genius able to lift weights at 10, genius what? you got a degree for playing violin? oh genius too yea you inherit 159 billion USD from Jeff Bezos at 10, genius Give them a round of applause guys! what? the 35 years old guy picking up rubbish around the neighborhood? let him die Surely everyone will be living forever in 100 years time don't them? Tell me this 15 year old kid will still be alive after 100 years lol
Interesting... that took a moment to parse. Seems to a variation of the default argument solution, with the added twist of storing the state in an iterator. The do we need the `enumerate` here?
I think you are right I will have to learn powerpoint. I'm just really slow at it right now and the charts are limited and its a pain to manually update the values into the charts EVERY time my manager wants to change something.
It's quite the opposite, everyone uses powerpoint I was just hoping if there was a better alternative. Guess I'll just have to learn PowerPoint
Thank you!
Thanks a bunch
iter(int, 1) returns an infinite number of 0's, so enumerate() turns it into a sequential generator
I agree, but I often work on fairly sizeable presentations (40-50 ish slides). And when the data changes I have to basically do the WHOLE presentation again manually feeding in the new data into every chart (or pasting the updated charts from matplotlib) one by one. eg: I'll make an interim report with some data then more data will come so I'll have to update the whole darn thing.
I have no idea what you’re talking about, and there’s a very high chance that you have no idea what you’re talking about either. The answer given is 100% the answer to what the OP asked. A “time.sleep()” in a loop an arbitrary amount of times is just as valid as one outside of a loop. It’s behavior does not change.
couldn't get enough of the attention like some insecure girls that learn to do make up at a very young age even if he gets to the top, his insecurities will get him one day yeah, I am talking about personal advice, don't you realize that? or you think this kind of "ability" will come as time goes? Best example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Holmes
Not sure if you are trying to be serious or if you are just parodying someone but, in either way, lol.
Ok. I'm on my phone, and I only learnt this information the other day. list, as in the type itself, is definitely subscribtable now, which was a syntax error before, but I haven't actually tried it to see if mypy supports it yet!
That would have been the answer if the question had been "Does time.sleep continue to work when the computer is in Sleep mode?". Afaik timer doesn't function by adding tick interval in every tick, it's rather checks on every tick does starting time + provided interval has passed current time. So in this case system went in sleep mode and when it wakes up Python checks does sleep function should be continue. If system was for 55 minutes in sleep mode and the sleep is set for one hour, then after 5 minutes Python script will continue. If system was in sleep mode for 75 minutes then script will continue immediately. Nothing else makes sense.

Right, of course! It's still a variation of the mutable default argument solution because it depends on the fact that an object to track the state is created at function definition time and then hangs around. But definitely a very creative way of turning that into a one-liner!

Oh, that sucks. Here are some ideas. Power point files are actually specially structured zip files. If you examine the completed power point file, you can programmatically unzip it, swap out the image assets, and rezip it. If you learn pandoc, you can have python overwrite your image assets and export the presentation again. I have found that Pandoc is great for very minimal presentations, but complex slides and figures made using the built in drawing tools will likely be too hard to be worthwhile.
I understand what you're trying to say but when you approach the question without context it makes little sense.
By GUI Textbox, do you mean a specific GUI package's text box? I'm not familiar with your Arduino environment. Does it run tkinter / other GUI packages? Can you install PySimpleGUI on that platform?
I think the question can be better phrased as: If a python program is suspended while it's on `sleep()`, how does it determine when to return? Does it * a) look at the actual sleep time, thus excluding the time suspended; or * b) loot at the start time and end time, thus including the time suspended First off, the [doc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.sleep): &gt; Suspend execution of the calling thread for the given number of seconds. The argument may be a floating point number to indicate a more precise sleep time. The actual suspension time may be less than that requested because any caught signal will terminate the `sleep()` following execution of that signal’s catching routine. Also, the suspension time may be longer than requested by an arbitrary amount because of the scheduling of other activity in the system. &gt; Changed in version 3.5: The function now sleeps at least secs even if the sleep is interrupted by a signal, except if the signal handler raises an exception (see PEP 475 for the rationale). Doesn't quite answer the question. Looking at /r/Groentekroket 's answer, it doesn't quite catch the essence of the question, since `sleep(4)` 100 times is drastically different from `sleep(400)`. So let's experiment. ``` $ python3 -c "import time; t=time.time(); time.sleep(10); print(time.time()-t)" 10.000890731811523 ``` Looks good. Now let's suspend it using ctrl-z ``` $ python3 -c "import time; t=time.time(); time.sleep(10); print(time.time()-t)" (wait for a few seconds) ctrl-z [1]+ Stopped python3 -c "import time; t=time.time(); time.sleep(10); print(time.time()-t)" $ (wait for another few seconds) fg python3 -c "import time; t=time.time(); time.sleep(10); print(time.time()-t)" 10.005335092544556 ``` Which means the answer is b), so /r/Groentekroket 's answer is actually incorrect. Now, I haven't tried actually turning my computer into sleep mode, but I believe it would be the same as ctrl-z. I would be happy to hear from anyone that tries it.
literally any type of 'box/window' which allows the serial monitor data to be displayed there instead of being displayed in the console window, like an application [https://gyazo.com/26a2f641842b1f50762c9b6a86d99c57](https://gyazo.com/26a2f641842b1f50762c9b6a86d99c57) &amp;#x200B; this is the type of data which i want to be displayed but in some sort of GUI, not console window. thanks
Woah, that's awesome!
&gt; You want a defaultdict that uses a different value every time a non-existent key is looked up d = defaultdict(uuid.uuid4) If you want to stick to numbers: d = defaultdict(lambda: datetime.datetime.now().timestamp()) If you want integers: d = defaultdict(lambda: int(datetime.datetime.now().timestamp()*1000000))
Take a look at [PySimpleGUI](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org). If it is installable / runable in your environment, then it'll be great for this particular problem. We're talking maybe 4 or 5 lines of code. See if you can pip install PySimpleGUI and do the verification as shown in the readme. It requires tkinter to run. Again, I don't know anything about your environment.

I tested this out with this script: `from datetime import datetime` `from time import sleep` `import sys` `def sleeper(secs):` `start = datetime.now()` `print(f"Started at {start.isoformat(' ')}")` `sleep(secs)` `end = datetime.now()` `print(f"Ended at {end.isoformat(' ')}")` `duration = (end - start).total_seconds()` `print(f"Slept for {duration} seconds")` `if __name__ == "__main__":` `sleeper(int(sys.argv[1]))` &amp;#x200B; ran [sleeper.py](https://sleeper.py) 180, put laptop to sleep for a few seconds, turned it back on, this is what happened: Started at 2019-05-01 16:27:08.428659 Ended at 2019-05-01 16:30:22.761584 Slept for 194.332925 seconds &amp;#x200B; so the answer is no, the sleep timer does not continue to count while the computer is in sleep mode.
Sleep in Python is not a call to system's sleep. Check out the [source](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/f1464f4d2ecf9b809ff768c523c5eea1abd31c55/Modules/timemodule.c#L1864). You'll find that it's based on the system's time, though. For Windows, it uses `GetTickCount64`, which is the time since the system started, and continues counting when it's hibernating. Therefore, Python's sleep will "continue" too. [Reference for if GetTickCount64 continues or not.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/513116) I haven't check out the other implentation's calls to system time, but I imagine they'd show the same behaviour. TL;DR: u/GroenteKroket (ragout kroketten zijn beter ;) ) was wrong, u/hopemeetme is right.
Here's a sample program that you could use for your project. Anything that you "print" will show up in the window instead of the console. You can see it running in your browser here: [https://repl.it/@PySimpleGUI/Reddit-Example-Arduino](https://repl.it/@PySimpleGUI/Reddit-Example-Arduino) It'll give you an idea of what the code is like when using PySimpleGUI. You can add the code in my while loop (the event loop) to your while loop.
Doesn't quite catch the essence of the question, since sleeping for 4s 100 times is different from sleeping for 400s. Please see my answer [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/bjh9fk/does_timesleep_continue_its_timer_when_the/em8bco3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).
i use pycharm, just installed it thanks, would it be a simple input box which would display the data? and if so, where should the while statement containing all the if/ elif statements be placed in my code? so not only it displays the data but also runs the conditional statements i have already written? thanks
It's great! Thank you for sharing it
I really did mean a counter... but as I stated the problem literally all these are valid solutions. The idea behind the puzzle is exploring how we can deal with persisting state between invocations of the default factory, and one way to deal with it of course is to avoid it altogether, or borrow it from the external world (time). I'll update the OP to be more specific.
If you use the example I posted, the only thing you need to add to your while 1 loop is this code: event, values = window.Read() if event in (None, 'Exit'): break Put the layout code and the window creation code before your while 1 loop.
Thanks, I think this is what Ive been looking for!!
I just ran your first script (with time.sleep(60)) and put my pc in sleepmode for a bit more than a minute. The console printed out 146.59... so the answer I provided was correct. &amp;#x200B; Funny how it raised so much confusion.
thank you so much!!! thats brilliant. im just wondering, it seems i have to press the ok button for the text to appear,, is there code for it to just run the code automatically in the window? instead of me having to press the ok button? if not it dont worry youve helped me more then enough already! i really appreciate it
Hmmm should we go on r/teenagers and ask if anyone wants to join and help too
Maybe it's implemented differently on different operating systems? What are you both running on?
Ah, sorry, I didn't think about the blocking call. &amp;#x200B; What you need to do is add a timeout parameter to the Read call. Make your read call look like this: event, values = window.Read(timeout=0) If your loop has a sleep in it, then remove the sleep call and instead set the timeout value to whatever you had as a sleep. Your "sleeps" happen inside the GUI that way.
Note that this is NOT because the `sleep` halts as well. The `sleep` actually expires in the time your system is suspended. You'd achieve the same results without the `sleep` (if your system is suspended for longer than, in this case, 4 seconds).
you're a star! honestly thank you very much. youve helped me alot!!!
That is what I guessing. I'm running Python 3.7.1 on Windows 1809.
Is it running on your Arduino board? Feel free to modify the layout, etc. Also, if you would rather see it all in a Web Page, you can use PySimpleGUIWeb instead of PySimpleGUI. Can you take a photo of your system running?
Please see my update. Putting the computer to sleep is different. However, your answer still doesn't catch the essence. Calling `sleep` in a for-loop is very different from sleeping for a long time because of "oversleep".
Looks nice in principle, but poor in execution. It looks like the code is calling functions whose definitions don't exist, so now I have to go read up on another library to understand why that is, but first I need to figure out that pipeop is actually the library I need to read up on. It decorates an entire function or class to overload certain operators inside. How does this not completely destroy readability?
If you pip install PySimpleGUIWeb and change the import statement to: import PySimpleGUIWeb as sg then when you run the code, it will connect via a web browser and show you this instead of the tkinter window: [https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/57026728-6ca80680-6c08-11e9-9936-2437cc145ac3.jpg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/57026728-6ca80680-6c08-11e9-9936-2437cc145ac3.jpg)
So, this is actually one of the things I'm trying to fix with the project. My most recent contribution has been adding a cli script that can read from standard input or a file and output the archive link to either a file or standard output. It's not great and I haven't added support for permacc yet, but it does work. The original code is pretty functional too, and there's a lot of room to expand.
Ah, I get that. In the end it depends on the way OP wants to implement the sleep. In the end, if you want to execute some code while the computer is sleeping it wouldn't work anyway. And if you want the code to have at least the least the value of sleep between the cycles it doesn't really matter anyways. Not sure where I was going with this comment but I guess you are right. ;)
how do you rotate/ move it?
[https://gyazo.com/deecb9898f0e86e52b7f52bef376aad2](https://gyazo.com/deecb9898f0e86e52b7f52bef376aad2) here you can see the window, displaying guide, and as you can see in my code, it opens up a notepad called guide (lets pretend theres information on how to use the device) [https://gyazo.com/6ee9d491971c797568cd35d5df1c52ae](https://gyazo.com/6ee9d491971c797568cd35d5df1c52ae) this is my actual arduino (messy i know, i am too lazy to make it look tidy...) &amp;#x200B; it kind of still stores the gestures and i have to press ok still for it to print them out and perform the actions for them, but it works great, i now have 2 ways to end the program, one with infrared sensing movement 3cm away and the other with an exit button on the gui.
This is so cool, great start, I wish I could do that at your age!
Friend of mine, and I are working on a D&amp;D bot for Discord, had to get all the items, and spells into a database, so I created a crawler that crawled through a D&amp;D wiki site, grabbed all the spells for all the classes, and all the items, and sorted them into an SQL database.
**You need to move this line of code:** event, values = window.Read(timeout=2) to be INSIDE of your while loop. Move it down there and it should work fine and you shouldn't have to press OK for anything to happen.
This is a seriously low-content post. Is someone using Reddit to SEO their way to Python hegemony? (tldr: `sort` sorts in place, `sorted` returns a new list).
Just so I understand better..... the GUI window that's being displayed is running on Windows or Linux, right? It's not running on the Arduino board itself. Your screenshot showed PyCharm running on the same screen as your output window so I assume that's windows or Linux.
i moved it inside the while loop now [https://gyazo.com/16418d6b84c768a57ce16d0fea6057f8](https://gyazo.com/16418d6b84c768a57ce16d0fea6057f8) it works for a few seconds, then it stops printing, if i press the ok button it then prints out the statements. is there some timer or interrupt that im not seeing?
Apart from the lack of interesting info the thing that really irked me was the `a.sort()` and `b.sorted()` as headings despite the fact that sorted isn't a method of list and therefore `b.sorted()` is not valid and it contradicts the actual examples
Dude, you've got an extra call to read at the bottom of your loop. You're calling Read twice, once with a timeout, once without. Move the if event statement up to the top of your loop, just after the call to [window.Read](https://window.Read)(timeout=0).
WoW man, I'm 16 (i have been learning python for 1 month) and I tried so hard to do that but nothing. Any prompts?
What OS are you using?
It would be really helpful if you posted your code somewhere instead of posting screenshots. Thankfully you posted enough of the screen that showed the duplicated call to Read. The timeout value is in milliseconds. Feel free to take a look at the [documentation](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org). It's rather extensive, but simple and easy to understand.
Your quick start example is hard to follow, what's the output of the code?
It probably uses the system monotonic clock. On Linux the monotonic clock doesn't run when the system is in sleep mode. However, the clock is system wide and runs even if some processes are stopped. Other operating systems may behave differently. Also, I think there is an alternative monotonic clock in Linux that would account for sleep mode time, but looks like Python doesn't use that.
My next question would be if the same behavior applies to the sleep command in bash 🤔
Oh i forget to add it, it prints "Hello and hello world! again"
I bet everyone's fogotten that the answer is probably implementation and OS specific. &amp;#x200B; You should probably poll every few seconds and check the real time clock rather than do a long calculated sleep.
I can see where the confusion came from - it seems like the PEP proposes to introduce this functionality in previous Python versions through the *same* future import as the one which implements postponed type annotations (from a different PEP). Despite this PEP #585 being a draft, I really hope that it is approved; the current duplicate type syntax is slightly unpleasant to use.

I think its brilliant! Currently trying to get it to run on my machine How did you turn the figures into videos?
I’ll elaborate on their behalf. There are two kinds of delays in software. One is “chew through *x* seconds of CPU time”. When your CPU sleeps then of course it’s not doing any processing and, when it wakes up, the program resumes chewing through CPU time exactly where it left off. The other is “resume after *x* seconds has elapsed” which gets effectively converted into “resume operation at 8:32 PM” and takes no CPU time. So you can have your program call sleep for 20 minutes, put the CPU to sleep for 19 minutes, and when it wakes the program will only have a minute left in its sleep call because that’s when 8:32 PM is.
The implementation in pseudo code seems to be something like: def sleep(duration): deadline = monotonic_clock.now() + duration while monotonic_clock.now() &lt;= deadline: timeout = deadline - monotonic_clock.now() # This will sleep for specified time, but it may return early or late # on some conditions err = select(..., timeout) if err.fatal(): raise err
 This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://able.bio/rhett/how-mixcloud-serves-15-million-users-a-month--15e98wf) reduced by a billion%. (Beep boop, I'm a not bot) \&gt; We are a Django application. 99% of it is synchronous Python and Django with MariaDB, a fork of MySQL, on the backend. Then we run Memcached for caching, Elasticsearch for search and we use RabbitMQ for queue management and background tasks. We also use Redis for certain high-speed counters we can’t afford to lose in the long term.

I thought this was a fun example for the new `:=` assignment expressions: ``` from collections import defaultdict d = defaultdict(lambda c=[0]: (c[0] := c[0] + 1) or c[0]) ``` But this is a `SyntaxError: cannot use named assignment with attribute` in Python 3.8 pre-release.
why not? it does the same thing?
Sure! Good idea
I have a background program using time.sleep that shuts down at about the time I shut down my PC. I went out today, which is quite the oddity in itself, so I slept my PC. Damn. Guess who's gonna stay up late today just to wait for a background python script to finish.
what would a test for that look like? loop over all elements to find the shift size, shift all elements (how?) and then check if the lists are equal? or is there a better way?
Very cool :-)
This grosses me out as much as our python 2 codebase at work...
Hi Martin, &amp;#x200B; I have currently working in Data Analytics for a manufacturing company. My primary skill set is in Python using Scikitlearn, Tensorflow, and some work with SQL server. I am still in school working towards a BA in computer science followed by a masters in Artificial Intelligence. Do you think my skillset could be considered for performing remote work? I live in the united states.
How do I run this code?
Now it's getting interesting, wish you luck!
Next you can try recreating (re-disco bring?) objects of constant width. There are a whole bunch of them out there. Cool project though.
Bash's sleep command is similar. The CPU and most peripherals are usually completely shut down when suspended.

Shhhh... don't let people know that you can solve problems without machine learning.
Think about a triangle in 3d space. It has nodes \[1, 2, 3\]. It's rotated as \[2, 3, 1\], but represents the same triangle, while the triangle \[1, 3, 2\] has an opposite normal.
You need Python 3.6. Also, you need to install the library Pillow.
Look for the variables xRotation, yRotation, zRotation and meshPosition
I always thought that sleep timers set a target datetime and simply keep checking the time until it is over the target. Are they actually counting cpu ticks / rtc millis?
Good idea
Double ended queue -- or a fifo. This is a data structure best used for things like buffers and task queues where you want to maintain temporal consistency between the elements in the queue. This includes jobs like network buffering, serial fifos, etc.They're often, but not always, implemented with ring buffers.
I can't decide if this is powerful or stupid. Do you have more use cases/examples?
Hey man that's pretty awesome!! Looks cool keep at it
Try my code. Also try to understand the basics of perspective and how it works - I'm sure you'll get it right!
It actually creates one of the features of [AnyAPI](https://github.com/FKLC/AnyAPI). AnyAPI depends on chainable calls and IMO it looks better so I thought people might like to use it. So I made an another library to let others achieve same with ease.
I used ImageMagick. Something like: convert -delay 5 -loop 0 `ls -v` out.gif
That reads itself interesting. I don't know how it's python3 for you (because it's just python for me lol), maybe it's because it's on a UNIX System (I think this $ sign is used in Unix System, right?) And Strg+Z doesn't seem to suspend execution for me. So when I run python -c "import time; t=time.time(); time.sleep(10); print(time.time()-t)" and suspend it with "Select Command Prompt" by left clicking it still gets the right time, but that's probably just because it suspends I/O in the Command Prompt till the selection is over, so the program executes unimpaired and just prints it output when "Select Command Prompt" is over. So maybe that's different from your Strg+Z suspension.
Get a PID of your script. Run a for loop in bash checking if the process with this PID is still alive. Make it shutdown your PC once your script is dead.
Is it all working right now?
Thank you. I am installing now.
First one it will work but second one it will not because its will set elastic_url string as value
Cool! You'll notice it reaches a pretty convincing optimum, but then starts drifting off center. Haven't figured out why yet.
I'm struggling to write one for myself. It would be helpful if you tell steps to write the script. Thanks in advance. Currently, I'm thinking of using Google slides API to convert data into slides but can't find a way to automate the conversion of slides in a video with TTS synchronized with it.
 `elastic_url = "https://"+ elastic_url` &amp;#x200B; Well he probably meant without the quotes.
Hey /u/Buharon \-- Adrian here from [PymageSearch.com](https://PymageSearch.com) and author of Deep Learning for Computer Vision with Python. To answer your question: Yes, you can always start by purchasing a lower tier bundle and then upgrade to a higher tier one simply by paying the price difference between them (you would not need to "repurchase" content you already own). Just pick up a copy of whatever bundle you want and when you're ready to upgrade, send me an email, and I'll get you the upgrade link.
It seems as if you're not subtracting the miles you travel from the milesleft variable?Try putting milesleft = milesleft - miles right under miles = random.randint(30,60)
Hey /u/careertroubleguy, thanks so much for including my book (Deep Learning for Computer Vision with Python) in your review list. I'm happy you enjoyed it so much! \&gt; I think I did that and he said you'd just have to pay the balance, but that was early last year Yep, only the balance needs to be paid. Readers can always upgrade to a higher tier by paying the price difference.
Everything I ever made was completed real time or nearly instant. My question is what could you be doing that takes all night for a background python script to finish? I understand if it like organizing a database or a business-level program but what would take so long for a simple script? I think it would be really cool making my PC work for extended amounts of time because of something I made. (That is actually productive and isn't 100000 loops)
I’m digging the Linux Mint as well
Thanks Adrian. I already know that because.after I asked the question here I send you an email and got a reply the same day so no worries. Thanks anyway ;-) now I have to get the money together, being poor student is sad :s
Alright I'll @ you in the post
Great! Just wanted to make sure you got a reply :-) As a student, [you're eligible for a discount as well.](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/faqs/single-faq/can-i-get-a-discount)
I love it. The projects that pick apart a simple idea using cutting-edge techniques are the same ones that can illustrate these concepts the best. One thing I would have liked to see is how this can be formulated as a reinforcement learning problem. Ultimately, that's what this basically is, but perhaps a proper formulation, i.e., using a Markov Decision Process, will highlight how this process can be generalized to find all sorts of shapes for all sorts of tasks. But, contrary to what I just said, I also like that this *doesn't* rely on more formulated reinforcement learning techniques as it demonstrates how RL works without actually using it (which can be an interesting perspective for someone who is familiar with RL). Maybe a follow up blog post can reconcile the two? In any case, this is an interesting project written up in an interesting way (your jokes at the beginning almost went over my head since most ML blog posts tend to be so dry). Perhaps if you have more time to work on this, you can describe the code a bit more and even supply a Colab notebook or something so others can play around with it!
Lovely didn't know that. What's the discount though as I can't see it being mentioned in the FAQ?
How can any function still working if the entire operational system is sleeping?

Hi, What you're trying to formulate is a typical linear constraint optimization problem and there are many options to make it work. As far as Python is concerned, PuLP is already mentioned. You can also check out the following article for more information: [https://towardsdatascience.com/linear-programming-and-discrete-optimization-with-python-using-pulp-449f3c5f6e99](https://towardsdatascience.com/linear-programming-and-discrete-optimization-with-python-using-pulp-449f3c5f6e99) Nutritionally speaking, in my opinion the approach has many problems. The optimization algorithm may come up with a solution which could be inappropriate; if there is a solution at all. Although it is possible to balance a diet for all nutrients, these diets are usually theoretical and not applicable (as-is) in everyday nutrition. The food choices and food quantities in these diets are in almost every case "incompatible" (distasteful). It will require many reformulations to get something that people can pleasantly eat. Another potential problem that might create confusion with your formulation, is that you use daily values as units for nutrients. Daily values show how much of a nutrient is in one serving of the food, for a 2000-calorie diet (healthy adults). Therefore, if you mess with energy (minimization), the DV coefficients of certain nutrients will change, because their value depend on energy consumption. Take a look at the following link: [https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/interactivenutritionfactslabel/pdv.html](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/interactivenutritionfactslabel/pdv.html) According to the link, the daily value of a single serving of any food, for total fat, in a 2000 Kcal diet, is calculated as, 100 \* food\_fat\_per\_serving(g) / 65g. But for a 2500 Kcal diet the calculation becomes, 100 \* food\_fat\_per\_serving(g) / 80g; the denominator changes when energy intake changes. As I understand, your equations are valid only for the case where the energy consumption level is equal to 2000Kcal. You'd be better off by replacing nutrient DVs with actual nutrient amounts, expressed in specific units (mg, g, IU, etc). If you like to investigate further, you can find alternative approaches of the Diet Optimization Problem in the Stigler Diet subreddit. There you can study ideas that others have implemented and figure out ways to improve them: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Stigler\_diet/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stigler_diet/)
Or you could just use the `requirements.txt` file in the first place as your lock file, rather than creating a problem by omitting it for no good reason. [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools) can help you generate it from a `requirements.in` file. [Aliases](https://github.com/AndydeCleyre/dotfiles/blob/master/.python.zshrc) can make everything convenient.

I've written landscape generator for blender for a hs project that was quite a handfull to run. Especially the hydro erosion (all in python...).
These are basically the same thing, since the date time is maintained by the operating system kernel tick timer in conjunction with the RTC. The operating system is completely shut down when the system is suspended (in *most* cases for modern computers), hence no timers or date time tracking. The RTC does keep ticking in the background to keep time, hence when the OS wakes back up it knows how much time has elapsed. It then checks any pending timers and will notice that more than the required amount of time has elapsed and trigger the timer. This is why OP's example code will usually show *more* time has elapsed than the requested duration.

Someone drill this in my brain!
When a computer goes into Sleep mode, the system state is saved into RAM, and power to the CPU is all but removed (no processing happens). With no processing, there's nothing to countdown. Once the system is restored from RAM, then processing continues. If it's more time sensitive, then base your timer off of system time.
No i mean without the f it will be not working it will not setting the value of the elastic_url
I don’t actually have a problem with your use of the word collates. I’m just being nit picky over some term you used because for some reason, you decided my use of the term “index” was false despite it being not false in any way that matters to the point I made. So no, it doesn’t collect or assemble or fold or place or merge or stick or gather. Those words aren’t perfect descriptions of what is happening and even though the definition doesn’t change anything about whether your point is right or wrong, I’m going to call them out as wrong.
You know how a mac can receive calendar updates and email while it's in sleep mode?
Okay so, I've never used Pyglet, but I have used Pygame. I liked Pygame just because it made sense to use. I'm not sure if there is a 3.5+ version yet though or not. That said, you don't really make the graphics in pygame at all. You would do that outside of pygame by creating sprites. Once you have your sprites you put them in a rectangle for collision detection. This, of course, is simplified, because you're gonna have sprites for all manner of objects and your pygame code will determine how they interact.
I'm glad! I'm happy to help out more with the project, including generating more tests for you (although it'll have to be well-scoped). &amp;#x200B; As for the last index I chose that because it relies on the shape of the two arrays, as I found out earlier you have a different (french?) locale which probably means the syntax for arrays is different. &amp;#x200B; For me (and in en-GB/en-US locales) the literal `{1, 2; 3, 4}` means the 2x2 array: 1 2 3 4 Since there's this kind of ambiguity in `={1,2}` it'd probably be for the best if either you standardised your locale (sadly, a US locale is the usual choice for this) or make your parser parameterised on the locale.
What do you mean? The article is about zip and the sample problem is all about using zip.
Send me an email and we can discuss there (also make sure you provide your student ID or email me from a university email address).
I followed your advice and implemented backface culling. It was a massive pain but it's done. Here's the code on Github (version 1.1.1): https://github.com/Forfunckle/python-3d-renderer And here's a render (with filled faces): https://imgur.com/a/lcaVAhH

I think the issue here is you have a colloquial understanding of the word “map”. You think to map something only ever means to take something from one place to another place. And so you would need to know the start place and the end place for that to work. But there is also a very technical/mathematical/computational meaning to map something. If you’re given a function and an input, then what it means to “map” that input is to just shove it into the function. So you don’t map it “to” anything. For example, if I give you the number x=2 and I tell you to map it using f(x) = x+x, then that function maps the number 2. The output you get is 4, but I didn’t need to tell you anything about the type of thing you need to map it to. That’s the same sense in which he’s using the word here. Zip does a type of mapping. That mapping is grouping items according to their index. And so if you’re told to take an input and to map it with zip, then you have enough information. Also, this absurd argument where because the person didn’t say the word “zip” in the explanation of the problem at the end of the zip tutorial means you didn’t realize you needed to use zip as the function to do the mapping just smacks of desperation. I think we have to be done here. You’re at the point where you’re just arguing so as not to admit that you are wrong. Which is not a point worth continuing the discussion anymore. I’m just going to block you and go on with my day. Have a good one.
Nice!
But how do you keep package versions compatible and updateable on different installations? One reason to use Pipenv was simplicity of managing development environment and locking dependencies to exact versions.
Mate, this shit is wild.
requirements.txt for development with exact versions, requirements.in (which can be fed into pyproject.toml) for looser version restrictions. But maybe I don't follow the question properly.

It uses the syscall select and is up to the kernel implementor to determine how it works, in linux it uses the system clock. See man select for more information on the syscall
That's outstanding! Thanks for sharing. I'm glad to see that you're getting useful feedback from developers more experienced than I in this thread. Keep it up!
Thank you!
Hey just saw you updated your code but instead of changing the same file and using branches you have 3 copies of the same file with different versions. Check out git branches
Why XML rather than csv? I’m not really familiar with XML use cases, so I’m curious. Thanks!
I am still new to GitHub so I don't really know how it works yet, thanks for the advice!
It's not that hard... &gt; But even worse is when a package author goes back to add support for a new platform—or a new version of python—for a release months or years after the fact. If you make code mods to support a new platform, you should bump the version. &gt; This is all but inevitable—PyPI only lets you upload distributions one at a time, creating a new release with the first upload that has a new version, so eventually someone is bound to download that first distribution before you upload the last one. Why is that a problem? If a Linux wheel is uploaded and I'm on Windows, I won't get the new version unless I check back in 5 minutes, so what's the issue? pip won't download it.
BTW I'm impressed by your code for your age that's a great job and math knowledge. Me myself wouldn't even know how to start this without spending a day or two reading about it and copy pasting lol. Can you point me to look into those maths you've used?
It is going to be difficult. Even with text encoded PDFs, the best way I found to get tabular data in a near deterministic manner was Tabula, which is actually a Java based tool, but which has python wrappers. However, if you are scanning the PDF yourself, as opposed to creating the PDF from some text source, you would first need an optical character recognition (ocr) program to extract the text, then you would need something to logically place that data where is actually resides in the document. You might be able to do something like that with Tesseract, but I have never had the time to devote to such a project. There might be other tools that could get you part of they way there, but most likely you are going to at best end up with a garbled mess of text that might not have any pattern to how it is garbled. My plan of attack would be to take the first page of data, fire up a jupyter notebook and just start playing around with different libraries and techniques to see if I could find something that works.
Alright. Thanks a ton!
maybe cuz is a wiki and anyone can put stupid stuff and QA is not perfect.
If you're familiar with gevent I wrote a tasks library, https://github.com/blakev/gevent-tasks threads, asyncio, huey, etc are also appropriate.
On Linux, this is the difference between `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` and `CLOCK_BOOTTIME`.
Im learning APIs so far ive learned about 80%.
Yeah, I had thought that too, but then I checked the PEP and it's actually \_explicitly\_ disallowed in lambdas. Guido really doesn't want to let lambda out of jail.
Good stuff 3c wrong i = 5 while i &lt; 0: print(i) i = i - 1 # Output: # 5 # 4 # 3 # 2 # 1
Thanks! I didn't know where to start either. I broke it down to 8th grade mathematics: the image you see is a plane in space. All vertices of the cube connect with an imaginary line to the same point (the camera). I figured out the formula to use for calculating the intersection of those lines with the plane of view (this is the 8th grade algebra part). Then I had to look into rotation matrices (which kind of went beyond my understanding) in order to make the rotation around a center point. For the backface culling (as seen here: https://imgur.com/a/lcaVAhH) I calculated the normal for every face and then the program decides whether to render that face or not by comparing these two distances: &lt;br&gt; d1 = distance(face normal, camera) &lt;br&gt; d2 = distance(face center, camera) &lt;br&gt; (if d1 is smaller than d2 then the normal is closer to the camera so the face is in the right direction, it can be rendered.) I hope this helped!

More importantly if you want to wake the computer up on time you will likely have to make use of the real-time clock to snap the computer out of sleep mode.

I can't speak for the OP but long running programs are usually data bound or CPU bound where they have some boundary factor for how long they take either due to large amounts of data or data sources or algorithms that take a long time to compute. A common example of something data bound is an ETL (extract, transform, load) process pulling data from several sources (files, databases, web services, etc) and loading it into a common data store where you spend most of the time waiting for I/O calls. Examples of something CPU or computationally bound are often found in things like running simulations in research or gaming, finding prime factors of a large number, and security testing.
I'm glad it was useful now for you, too. My biggest problem is now to use this in my c# gui. I expected to use it easily with IronPython but it seems I cant use matplotlib with IronPython ... &amp;#x200B; I'm running out of time and ideas \*sigh\*
Fluent python is very good. It's directed toward intermediate users. Unfortunately it's a bit dated now as it is based on python 3.3 or 3.4,.so it does not cover new stuff such as asyncio.
Good to know, thanks for the reply
It's still very good book especially for that price.
More like "Porting Callback Hell to Python"
Yeah I just picked it up, plus I also wanted the web scraping one even though I have Automate the Boring Stuff with Python.
Disregarding the fact that the given examples are all solvable using lambdas (as much as I'm not a big fan of those), in my opinion this inline API is the exact opposite of the two lines quoted: simple is better than complex, readability counts. Declaring the functions like you normally would makes them much clearer, more understandable and keeps your code clean (with much less noise and clutter). It also gives you the benefits of having them as actual first class objects (instead of anonymous calls somewhere) and let's them be reused around your code. [I recommend this arrivals by Trey Hunner](https://treyhunner.com/2018/09/stop-writing-lambda-expressions/) where he talks about some problems with lambda functions which I fear will be a reality given this sort of API.
Ehm. I have to break it to you. This exists in Python. You might want to look at lambda functions.
Wow. This looks... Aweful. Inline indentation? Really?
It's probably worth it to optimize the program if its taking multiple hours to complete, though. Things that are I/O bound should be done with async or threads so that you don't hold up execution waiting. Things that are CPU bound should have the intensive bits pushed to an language that can compute the code quicker than Python, like C or Rust.
I picked it up and just started on TDD with python. It’s using Django 1, not sure how big of a change that is from 2 as I’ve never used Django before. The DS books sounded like they were great for non-beginners and those transferring from R. I’d be curious if there are any of these to avoid spending time on and why.

Sleep mode freezes RAM usage so no.
I do machine learning with Keras and my simple scripts (usually around ~250 line file) can easily take a day to run.
I think your suggestions are less readable. I think you're too influenced by JS and the JS paradigm. But, aren't you basically proposing "pipes"? [Something like this](https://hackernoon.com/adding-a-pipe-operator-to-python-19a3aa295642).
That's called power nap, it's not sleep mode, and so it's irrelevant. Macs, when in sleep mode, do not get updates because like any other UNIX system, they freeze system resources and shove things into RAM. Power Nap is a patented power-saving mode. It's not related at all.
This method will come very much in handy for all sorts of web scraping projects. I’ve used it myself. Browser dev tools are awesome.
There are several ways that you could do it: the brute force method is to check if the lists are equal, and then rotate b, repeat at most n-1 times. There are other potentially more optimal solutions, but would depend on list size, contents, etc. For example, you can optimize by not comparing if the first list element isn't the same between the two lists.
Colgate?
Try this instead: df1 = df1.sort_values(['ticker','date']) df1['profit'] = df1.groupby('ticker')['open'].diff() + df1['dividend']

Fluent Python alone is worth the price of the $15 bundle imo.
There aren't any \*huge\* changes between django 1 and 2. The biggest difference is how the urls are mapped to views, in django 1 it was regex based, where as django 2 has a much nicer way of setting them up.
As for me, the main difference is graphics/sprites positioning. In pygame coordinates take integer values only. If you need to use another size of the game window, it results in different animation speed, as you can not move objects of less than 1 pixel. There are numerous other differences, as e.g. constructing and steering the game loop (easier in pyglet, as to my taste). My overall impression: pygame is suitable for educational purposes; pyglet seems more difficult at the first sight, but is more flexible.
Use SciPy to read WAV file and apply the filter wchich is included in SciPy libraries? If you want to implement the filter manally, after you read the file you get a numpy array which you can manipulate. To play sound I used Pyddub as it was pretty simple and straigt forward. If you are interested in signal processing there was a book about usage of Python for this. If I remember correctly it's free and you can find it [here.](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-dsp/)
Maybe put that into a csv and read it in when the program starts. That way, you only need to change the csv to change the times. 08:00, 17:00 function: read when starting again and before ending your process re-read the file at the start and end of each run so if you wanted to change the times in mid-run, you can do it on the fly. essentially, if it is running and it is 09:00 but you changed to run to 10:00, you can wait untill 10:00. but if you changed to stop time, it will stop at the new time.

Flask Web Development is a very good reference. The author regularly updates his blog so the book may be a bit dated. &amp;#x200B; Can't speak for many other books but I did get the $1 bundle for NLP.
Jesus dude it's marketing. It's not sleep mode, it's both technically and functionally not the same thing. It's literally a completely different feature to sleep mode. You have, on any Mac: * Sleep Mode * Power Nap Do you know why they're called different things? Because they're not the same. Why on Earth would you need this explained to you?
I snagged the $15 bundle because I figured it couldn’t hurt and that Fluent Python was worth it alone. Started paying through Introducing Python and ended up learning something I wasn’t familiar with. Shoutout to namedtuples!
Not sure what you mean
&gt;Not quite as pretty, is it? Hm… I actually think the Python is significantly easier to read and understand than the Javascript. At the very least, using named functions provides some element of self-documentation which is lost with anonymous ones.
3.7 has data classes, which are like namedtuples but better
Android and my Windows Surface all have the same feature. It's "Stay connected to wifi whilst asleep" on the Surface option, and Android does it automatically. I'm sorry that you feel this is incorrect behavior, and that Apple, Microsoft snd Google all have it wrong. Real software differs significantky from the textbooks, and this is fault of the education system, and not you.
Jesus is that what you think I'm saying? I'll stop wasting my time.
When I was around the same age I mastered 2D perspectives (e.g. rotation) for a computer game I was writing. When I asked my grade 13 math teacher how to change it into 3D perspective he admitted he had no idea! :D Nice work!
Very creative! Leave tracking the state to the size of the dictionary. Guaranteed to be increasing, although not monotonically, since we might insert elements without invoking the default, so not strictly a counter. But in a real-world use case this might be a winner for its simplicity. Also, it involves a closure (the lambda closes over 'd').
All this upvotes and no comments? :thinking:
I never even considered team oriented projects where connection files need to be shared - that's a great point! I'd have to succumb to your expertise there - I have no experience with the best way to go about that. My only stipulation would be that it is optional and hidden when not used to keep the basics of the project as simple as possible. &amp;#x200B; Another thought is having a default .connections.yaml in a standard location that can be loaded when the file isn't present in the root folder of the project and not specific in load\_connections(). This would make it pretty easy to write quick scripts without worrying about copying in a full connections file each time. I know there is some backlash recently about too many projects putting dotfiles in the home directory so will need to research where the best place to store and load it from would be. What are your thoughts on that?

Resumes definitely, but also think about what kind of career you want. (Location, teamwork vs no teams, work from home, culture, etc.) A lot of the recruiters there aren't necessarily exclusively staffing Python jobs, so you might already be qualified for a job they have and the fact that they are at PyCon means that you could potentially pivot to a job that requires Python skills. I've worked a lot of job fairs and I love someone with enthusiasm for learning and a real passion for something over someone qualified that doesnt have drive or interest.
Why do they need my email address so bad?
In my opinion the hello world teaches you about the input output process and the work flow required in all subsequent programs: 1. Write code 2. Read code 3. Save code 4. run code 5. Debug, rerun code Keep going! Try picking up a project based learning path based on thing that interest you.
I think these suggestions kinda degrade the beauty of Python syntax and I agree with what others have already mentioned: it kinda break two items of the zen of Python (Simple is better than complex and Readability counts). The only thing in JavaScript I would bring to Python is the syntactic sugar of descriptors. Descriptors work similarly in both languages (with its particularities, of course), but I find get/set keywords more readable than the use of decorators. Considering that Python makes excellent use of keywords and has a fairly readable API, I believe this sugar would be very useful, but I don't consider it a priority and doesn't having it is not a negative point.
Not trying to sound like an a\*\*hole, but all of this is fairly basic isn't it? I started learning Scrappy with scraping reddit and therefore I think are fairly simple examples involving simple concepts. Am I wrong?
How can you understand the difficult stuff if you don't understand the simple stuff? Heart surgeons don't start doing heart surgery on day one. It takes years of training first. You need to learn basics before you can get to "real world" python. If you can't learn the basics, you will never be a good developer.
Yeah. In reality, the output would be nothing. OP flip less than to greater than.
Your terminology is incorrect for lesson 2, "Variable Types". Python is a dynamically typed language so variables don't have types. What you're describing are the different types of *values* not *variables*. There's no such thing as an "integer variable," but there are integer *values*. In lesson 3 your description of `range` is misleading, and you shouldn't even bother talking about `xrange` or Python 2. This whole section is confusing and serves no purpose. The online Python evaluator doesn't display the correct output, either. Compare it to a real Python 3 REPL.
The only real guidelines really would be to have the configuration file: - general, not specific to any one user - secret-less. Secrets should be pulled in once at runtime. I don’t see anything wrong with storing a file in the user’s home directory. Many popular programs do that, I think some people are just advising not to over-pollute, maybe use a general directory like ~/.config/&lt;name&gt; to hold basic configuration. I’ve cloned the project, seeing how best to implement my suggestion. I agree, secret managers should not be required, but easy to plug in if desired. Most should be able to just grab credentials that the providers’ command line tools already use. Needless to say, this is specific to how I’m imagining it working. In particular, when I say “secrets should be pulled in once at runtime”, that’s one way of doing it. You could also pull in secrets whenever you want, store them in a .gitignored file, and read those once at runtime. This doesn’t necessarily make running it easier, but let’s you iterate quicker in development.
For examples of useful Python programs, see "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" in the sidebar. If that's not your cup of tea, maybe "Invent your own computer games with Python" (also in the sidebar). Your problems seems to be that you're watching some random "learn python" video rather than picking a good book and working all the way through it.
Why reinvent the wheel? Assuming your firewall is running linux, the ip command will return the specific route a given destination will take. If it's not linux every OS built for routing will have similar functionality. http://www.policyrouting.org/iproute2.doc.html#ss9.5.7
They did not ask for my email address.
`from collections import defaultdict` `def foo():` `foo.cnt += 1` `return foo.cnt` `foo.cnt = 0` `dd = defaultdict(foo)` I hope this counts as new solution.
As far as Scrapy goes, these examples are some totally basic stuff. Not even a hint of "advanced".
Sorry, apologies for not being clear. This is an enterprise environment. We're talking about 20+ firewalls that multiple users would access this routing database to lookup where a subnet lives. It would be so much easier than checking multiple firewalls.

Well, I *guess* you can say I'm new to python. I have a fair amount of knowledge about syntax with plenty of hunger to learn, but I just don't know exactly how to apply what I know into something practical. With that being said, I did at least take the time to create a few based IDLE based scripts with commented out portions in the code. Kinda like a beginner's pocketbook!

Ah, ok. Thanks.
Incredible set well worth it
I have a few books, but most notably - web scraping with python is great. Think Bayes is ok. It illustrates how to think about Bayesian problems, but the code isn't very scalable, it's just used for handling problems in the book mainly. So I wouldn't recommend. I haven't dug into Flask web development much yet, but I have it on my shelf waiting for me. And NLP is pretty dense and written in python 2.
Sorry, it's bedtime in my timezone, and my brain is getting foggy... but it looks to me that what you're doing falls under 'meta-programming'. Pardon me if I'm wrong, I'll look at it again tomorrow.
Not advanced in the least, but definitely useful if you've never used Scrapy before. I found it informative.
Whoops! I guess I gotta spend more time checking everything again. Great catch!

I'd use the string "&lt;broadcast&gt;" instead of an IP. &gt;&gt;&gt; import socket &gt;&gt;&gt; socket.gethostbyname("&lt;broadcast&gt;") '255.255.255.255' HTH
I use Python module \`ipaddress\`: \&gt;&gt;&gt; from ipaddress import IPv4Address, IPv4Network \&gt;&gt;&gt; host = IPv4Address(addr) \&gt;&gt;&gt; net = IPv4Network(addr + '/' + mask, False) \&gt;&gt;&gt; #self.\_\_log.debug('addr = {addr!r}'.format(addr=addr)) \&gt;&gt;&gt; #print('Mask:', MASK) \&gt;&gt;&gt; #print('Subnet:', ipaddress.IPv4Address(int(host) &amp; int(net.netmask))) \&gt;&gt;&gt; #print('Host:', ipaddress.IPv4Address(int(host) &amp; int(net.hostmask))) \&gt;&gt;&gt; self.\_\_log.debug('broadcast\_address = broadcast\_address!r}'.format(broadcast\_address=net.broadcast\_address)) And I receive valid UDP broadcast address bases on my netmask and IP address. There is no problem with address is problem with socket state (or status). Thanks.

I long for the days of managing 20 firewalls. I routinely deal with 300+ along with over 1000 routers. What you're describing is ipam and should be as automated as possible, including route discovery. this one isn't bad on a budget of $0, but there are tons of others out there: http://www.gestioip.net
In the pic, how does he get such nice intellisense for those libraries. My vsvode doesn't give such detail, anyone know the plugin?
Does Scrapy still have that issue where you can't use it in Python 3 under Windows without doing so through Anaconda? (Which also never worked for me)
Might just be PyCharm which has similar features built in.

If you aren't set on Python, Sonic Pi uses Ruby to make music, you could dig into that project and see how things work.
Good question. How would you test it?
Ok, I don't mind learning the basics, I just don't see why when I try to ask what can I use in real world everyone gives me a hard time and tells me to go google and all it comes up with is "hello world" nothing about what kind of scripts I would be using as a Network Administrator, just "Hello World".
Ya I was thinking of getting that book, I have the Python Playground from the same Publisher, maybe same writer.
I'm not looking for code or anything, I'm just looking for something more involved than "Hello World" type videos. Those I learn in class, we never get to do scripts that we will use in real world. We do the If the, else, which stuff, but it's never like how one of my professors said he wrote a script when he first started to compile the log files into a single place and then had the script spit out the ones that needed attention and to bypass the rest. That's what I'm talking about. Oh I'm going to learn the basics. This class starts in 3 weeks no doubt am I going to learn hello world. I just want to understand how to write a script for real world not just hello world.
I made a script to plot images of the analemma (look it up, it's one word!). *I would like to deploy this script online as an app* What's the best way to do this? It's a rather simple code, using pysolar and basemap to get the data and map the sun. I want users to input their latitude and other variables and hit enter to get a picture. I am more of a data scientist and not a web developer so please excuse my ignorance.
I've had good luck with [https://www.w3schools.com/css/](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) I really like flexboxes. They also make development easier across multiple platforms (like if someone wants to use your page from a phone or a computer). If you're already familiar with Python, check out Jinja2 for your Flask page as well. It's like HTML + Python. So it may help you learn as well. HTML is pretty straightforward. You have a start tag and an end tag (same as the start but with a /). The tag applies to the stuff between things.
It's impossible to tell without at least seeing your code. My default guess would be vectorization and/or cache coherency.
I agree, this does not seem possible.
You need to set `SO_BROADCAST` on your socket before you can `sendto()` to broadcast addresses. Also, whatever you're trying to do, UDP broadcast is very likely not the way to do it.

How do you mean index? Mapping the topics of the book to page numbers? If so, I dont think that would be that hard. Are you trying to store the info long term?
I'm a complete newbie at coding, python and Scrapy was my introduction to frameworks. I started about a month ago , had a lot of issues with installation but fixed it in a day and a half (keep in mind I'm a noob and had to learn how to work with terminal and all of that stuff...) as far as issues go, you can install it normally through pip install (never got it to work through pycharm installation, everything works well when it comes to plugin installation), then manually get everything else terminal spits at you. For me, the last (and biggest) thing I had to install to make it work, was twisted and since then everything works smooth and I already have some, (in my eyes) impressive spiders running. You can pm me if you get struggle with something in my free time I might send you some links that helped me get it up and running!
I'm trying to make a list of pages that I can add with user input. I was trying to use if statements to organize the pages into order in a list.
I'll look into it, thanks!
You got any resources for Advanced Scrapy? I think I have got the basic stuff down, but things get complicated quick when you start overriding methods and bring Twisted into play. Any help is appreciated.
That’s Atom text editor. There’s a package called python-autocomplete that is like the one in the picture. I use it and it’s great!
Soon LP/MIP will also come under machine learning like mean/median/mode
Just FYI everyone, pretty sure scraping amazon is against their TOS, so proceed with caution. Great learning exercise.
Why you say”higher dimensional arrays” do you mean NumPy ( which is c-based)? In general, PyPy likes clean, simple code. Since python is a dynamic language, PyPy uses guards to check that the jitted code’s arguments and functions are consistent. Deeply layered code, classes with dictionaries, and loops within loops all require more guards. Try looking through this blog post for an idea how to approach the analysis https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2017/10/how-to-make-your-code-80-times-faster.html
&gt; When you say”higher dimensional arrays” do you mean NumPy ( which is c-based)? No, sorry I should've been more specific. Before the refactor most data structure were actually sparse, 1D arrays treated like ND arrays using indexing schemes. I could explain why but suffice it to say I inherited this code from a coworker who only knows C. I guess the punchline is coding Python like it's C is slower with Python but way faster with PyPy. Anyways thanks for your thoughtful comment and the link, everything you said makes sense.

It depends on what you're interviewing for. What's in the job description?
Master-less majority-less fully-distributed key-value storage. https://github.com/smurfix/distkv
+1 Fluent Python is really great.
I understood and decided to use the pillow for image creation and stuck on creating TTS synchronized video. I mean looking at the corner cases (like a very short or very long comment in an image) we can't just set manual time(a bad design I guess) for every frame transition. Would like to know how you did it?
Does anyone "more advanced" scraping resources? Like architectural concepts, pitfalls and patterns when scraping multiple sources, design choices when you have to do certain actions before accessing data. Aswell as storage concepts on premise and cloud based. Im trying to search good literature but most of the times my understanding of "advanced" is somehow different.
I've never used ironPython or c#, however pyQt5 is a pretty good gui toolkit. So is pygtk. You can also integrate matplotlib plots inside these guis (not just popping them up), if that's interesting for you.
Agree. This doesn’t seem very advanced...
Added it to my post
Not that I want to blame exact this one for beeing to simple. It seems most of the articles, posts, tutorials are just like "how to use bs4 and requests" or "how to use selenium" or "how to build a scrapy app" when you try to find realy advanced concepts. That's somewhat realy teadious when you want to realy get an expert in this field.
It seems that you want a cron job to run your program every x seconds.
When combining the pictures and TTS files I just set the length of the imageclip to the length of the sound clip (plus some extra at the start and end so that the TTS doesn't speak all the time)

Thanks!
Thank you
Oh god that's a very trashy they did. Injecting ads through bought open source tools. But the maintainers of the tools are also partly to blame because they enabled that.
https://weboob.org
Thank you. Not the pre-chewed book I hoped for, but a very solid source for reference research. I thank you very much for the link. I'm taking a closer look the next few days. Hopefully I can adapt some concepts.
unfortunately the current project runs already in an extensive C# user interface, that can't be changed. So I need to find a way to make the python script run under C# while the matplotlib.tri functions can be used.
I know, but it's the most advance scraping lib I know. They have a pretty active community, don't hesitate to ask questions.
You mean ``` import random def sarcasm(s): return "".join([c.upper() if random.randint(0,1)==1 else c.lower() for c in s]) print(sarcasm("Is this better?")) ```

Pythonprogramming.net and he has videos on YouTube as 'sentdex'. The best.
If you're interested in Flask, the Miguel Grindberg book is worth the $15 alone. Even if you value your time at minimum wage, having those examples will save you hours of time.
/r/learnpython for asking questions. Use NumPy to generate cosine wave and to distort it with a polynomial. For playback, you can use pysounddevice.
Did you understand how he made the loop / list comprehension? For example you can do this: squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(4)] This would return a list of squares. This can be used for a lot of different things, and for simples loops like yours it can be done with list comprehension. Learning this helped me make simple stuff even simpler :)
Sure, thanks it can do the job easily.
You don't need to turn a string in to a list, it's already iterable :)
You can leave out the `==1`.

I've bookmarked this post, I'm excited to see the resources people post. This is a very interesting subject.
Thanks for the one on signal processing. Looks like a pretty good book. 👌
PLEASE add readme with some basic info. Atleast with how-to-use instructions. Do not throw code on us in this way &lt;3 With nice readme more people are likely to go through your work on github. &amp;#x200B; Some useful links: * [Making readmes readable](https://github.com/18F/open-source-guide/blob/18f-pages/pages/making-readmes-readable.md) * [A beginners guide to writing a Kickass readme](https://medium.com/@meakaakka/a-beginners-guide-to-writing-a-kickass-readme-7ac01da88ab3)

What is advanced about this?
Should include docs about required modules and possibly links to instructions about virtual environments? Traceback (most recent call last): File "game.py", line 3, in &lt;module&gt; from pyfiglet import Figlet ImportError: No module named pyfiglet
Why a list comprehension and not a generator comprehension?
I see. Run it in a separate process, communicating over TCP/IP? If you're on UNIX, pipes can also be used (they work like files, which you can open as read in one program and as write in another; in the "receiving program" you call the file reading routine which will basically hang until there is data, and then when you write&amp;flush in the "transmitting program" the receiving program unblocks and can continue to run. &amp;#x200B; I've used TCP/IP to communicate between MATLAB and Python, and pipes between Python and Fortran. Both are quite easy.
Kite is a great resource but is shady af and I'll never trust them again.
Bruce Eckel!! Should be good/great
I had a quick skim through it and it seems fairly comprehensive. Definitely saving it for later reference.
[https://code-maven.com/list-comprehension-vs-generator-expression](https://code-maven.com/list-comprehension-vs-generator-expression) Because he used square brackets, which aren't needed though. Join takes any iterable. a more compact version would be: ``` import random def sarcasm(s): return "".join([c.upper(),c.lower()][random.getrandbits(1)] for c in s) print(sarcasm("this is (probably) faster and shorter!")) ``` Which uses the fact that a bit is already a number, and that [getrandombits is faster](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6824681/get-a-random-boolean-in-python), and that the dict is always length 2, meaning you can access it a by a singular random bit. It is less readable for sure, and i would probably go with the above example by /u/rju83 , just without the `==0` as numbers can be autocast to bools in Python.
I think the problem is that most of these things depend heavily on the case. Things to consider are for example: Do you scrape the same pages more than once? Is it feasible to full scrape every time? What are speed/connection limits for the targets? What do you want to do with the collected data? I think it's very difficult to have a most common approach here. Many things depend not actually on scraping, but on data storage (I guess there are resources for that, but things are different for every case as well.) As far as "scraping strategy" goes most things are very easily implemented with middlewares, such as Proxies (in whatever way you want), saving HTMLs to rescrape stuff without making new requests, saving scraping progress, ...
But it’s immutable. So you’d have to use replace()
Ah, good point I guess I'd do it in a comprehension anyway, it doesn't even occur to me to use an imperative loop with mutation without a good reason, so I forget about these things ;)
If we're golfing, \`import random;random.getrandbits(1)\` is the same length as \`\_\_import\_\_("random").getrandbits(1)\`, but saves a newline in your example ;) i couldn't figure out how to get your code any shorter though
Okay, a high level way to go about things would be to pick a speech recognition engine of your choice. Mozilla provides an open source implementation of baidu's deep speech, so that's a good point to start [https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech) (I assume 'from scratch' doesn't mean literally from scratch, because writing the entire thing yourself is probably a herkulean effort) Then when you've parsed the user input the simplest way would be to go with a bag-of-words model. Split the user input up, check whether the user input contains some phrase associated with a certain task, execute that task (say if the user says 'time', you respond with the time) and then send that back to the user.
I've interviewed a number of python developers, amongst a handful of other roles. To me, the thing I value above all is honesty. Team fit is a huge thing, and I can sniff out someone who's bullshitting a mile off. Someone like that will not fit in to any team I want to work in. I would go in to this interview and sell yourself on your strengths, diversity of experience, ability to translate that experience to a technology that you're not as experienced with, enthusiasm to work with the technology. Just do not try and convince these people you're something you aren't. It means a break down in trust, you trying to hide incompetence to do what's expected of you etc.
I think this is not really a reinforcement learning problem, as you are not trying to learn a policy how to change your wheel shape over time. Instead, you are learning the optimal wheel shape to gain the highest possible overall speed. Well, maybe you could learn a policy how to change the wheel shape while the terrain is changing?

I see a lot of people saying this, and I wholeheartedly disagree. Sometimes, I just want a namedtuple as its both simpler and support tuple-unpacking. The latter is super useful when a function returns a namedtuples. Often, I create namedtuples when I have a function that returns a few similar metrics (e.g. sensitivity and specificity) instead of simply returning a tuple so people can easily see which is which in an interactive terminal.
I don't know what tips he got but a good way to do that is with Selenium working with a headless browser (headless chrome for example) and then parsing the page with BeautifulSoup.
I believe that comment is placed to emphasize that generator comprehension is the better solution, both as string's join accepts an iterable and for the sake of "can be used for a lot of different things".
That sounds very cool, good luck to you!
Maybe you could even add some logic to spot typical misspelled email addresses like: @gnail.com, @gmail.co You could do this with a list of the most common domains, then for the most uncommon domains check their proximity to a common one using FuzzyWuzzy. Good luck!

To add to this. Yes, you can learn an awful lot in a week. You can become productive very quickly in numpy and pandas. I'd find a well regarded course of video lectures on the subject, rather than just try learning it on your own. It should accelerate the process.
Lol Fedora 25 ? It's a bit outdated stuff In first of may the 30 is released...
This is a good course. It actually only cost £10gbp when I bought it last year. It's quite expensive now! I would recommend it if you're serious though, and you think you're competent to do the role! https://www.udemy.com/python-for-finance-and-trading-algorithms/
And BTW, this is the only course I can recommend, as it's the only one I've done. Hopefully someone else can recommend something too, that doesn't cost as much!
Umm … IMHO pypi is a package archive, not some place to announce (and possibly discuss) new packages. (Of course my code is there already.)

So, yeah, this definitely meta-programming; you're altering the normal behaviour of the core language by letting an otherwise uninitialised local variable have a default value. Not that there's anything necessarily wrong with that, after all Python provides the tools for it, but I had explicitly said to find solutions that don't don't involve meta-programming, mostly because once you allow it you can really invent an infinite variety of solutions... you basically creating new languages.
Actually I know very well perspective because I'm in a scientific school. The hardest part is the code itself. Do you have a GitHub link or something?
W3schools blows goats
You could also do this in one line with a list comprehension `print("".join([item.upper() if index % 2 == 0 else item for index, item in enumerate(input("Type in sentence: "))]))`
https://github.com/Forfunckle/python-3d-renderer Here's the link to the GitHub page
I think this is true. But are there no „guidelines“ which are at least hinting to the things I have to consider. It would be great to unterstand in which cases I should go for which decisions. Or something like explained examples.

Two pieces of advice that are more beginner friendly, than some of the list comprehensions posted by others: You don't need x as a counting variable, if you already have y as your loop variable. You can just delete the second line and the x=x+1 and then replace every x with y. You can use integers like bools: if r: do something else: do something else does the same as if r == 1: do something else: do something else Every number except for 0 gets evaluated as True, while 0 is evaluated as False.
I just saw this and remember I made something similar a while back. alternater.py: `low = bool(input("start_with_lower (boolean)? "))` `text = list(input("text_to_alternate (string)? "))` `print("".join([text[i].lower() if (low and i%2==0) or (not low and i%2==1) else text[i].upper() for i in range(len(text))]))` `input()`
 `print(''.join(map(lambda char: char.lower() if __import__('random').randint(0,1) else char.upper(), input('Type something: '))))`
Protip: use this: https://docs.python.org/3/library/fileinput.html
if random.choice((True,False))
Are you talking about this [https://textract.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html](https://textract.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)?
nice
It's funny to see all these sophisticated speculations about my script. The purpose of it is to track how long I have each process open during my computer usage time. :)
too far? import random; print(str("".join(chr(ord(c) + random.choice([0,32]))) for c in input()))
In actual coding for real projects, never sacrifice readability just to show how smart you are. Your code was great.
Planning to make a gui for a Simulink-like API for work. Didnt want to do it, but figured it's what'll get people unfamiliar with python to use it
So I learned a depressing thing today. At least with my timeit tests in Python 3.5.4. Passing the generator directly to str.join was slower in every test. Even with long strings. This makes me sad. The rand.getrandbits(1) trick is nice! That really speeds things up. random.choice was faster than random.randint. random.choice((True,False)) was faster than random.choice((0,1)). FWIW: The indexing appears to be faster than case setting. Here's a relevant subset of my experiments. I ran a lot of them. ```python Python 3.5.4 (v3.5.4:3f56838, Aug 8 2017, 02:17:05) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. &gt;&gt;&gt; import timeit &gt;&gt;&gt; timeit.timeit("sarcasm('Is this better?')", "import random\ndef sarcasm(s): return ''.join([c.upper() if random.randint(0,1) else c.lower() for c in s])") 40.167259099999995 &gt;&gt;&gt; timeit.timeit("sarcasm('Is this better?')", "import random\ndef sarcasm(s): return ''.join([c.upper() if random.choice((0,1)) else c.lower() for c in s])") 26.568237600000003 &gt;&gt;&gt; timeit.timeit("sarcasm('Is this better?')", "import random\ndef sarcasm(s): return ''.join([c.upper() if random.choice((True,False)) else c.lower() for c in s])") 26.31848500000001 &gt;&gt;&gt; timeit.timeit("sarcasm('Is this better?')", "import random\ndef sarcasm(s): return ''.join([c.upper(), c.lower()][random.getrandbits(1)] for c in s)") 11.984438100000034 &gt;&gt;&gt; timeit.timeit("sarcasm('Is this better?')", "import random\ndef sarcasm(s): return ''.join([[c.upper(), c.lower()][random.getrandbits(1)] for c in s])") 11.188746000000037 &gt;&gt;&gt; timeit.timeit("sarcasm('Is this better?')", "import random\ndef sarcasm(s): return ''.join([c.upper() if random.getrandbits(1) else c.lower() for c in s])") 7.088630899999998 ```
What are you doing with Python?
I agree. It might be possible to phrase the original in terms of RL, but I don't think it's the most natural view of it. For example, maybe the "policy" could be how to evolve the wheel to improve it. It could work, it just takes some gymnastics.
You can get a PhD with that in China
Is scrapy similar to beautiful soup?

Honestly `upper()` and `lower()` are better. This way only works for upper case inputs (lowercase will get pushed even higher) and also will incorrectly modify spaces. A weak fix would be: import random print("".join(chr(ord(c)+random.choice([0,32])) if not c==' ' else c for c in input().upper())) But again, this will also incorrectly modify symbols as well. If you are looking for a one-liner, this should work. print([globals().update({"random":__import__("random")}),''.join(random.choice([str.upper,str.lower])(c) for c in input())][1])
I just recently installed Python and am using Jupyter notebook. I am just beginning to teach myself coding because it coule prove to be useful for school projects.

What's the advantage of using map+lambda instead of a generator expression?
Then learn Python and look at medium for Python and data science. Learn how to do research
Using insightface for recognition https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/blob/master/README.md
I would go through the python tutorial on the official python docs https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html This should give you a basic idea of the language and covers most of the standard libraries. After that you'll have to fine into topics that you are more interested in.
Will do. Thank you for the pointer.
Then add in xclip so when you run it it’s ready to paste where you want it. 👍
I always get rather confused when someone asks for beginner libraries. Once you've mastered syntax you should be able to work with most of the extremely popular ones, if not chances are someone ran into your issue or it's a simple read in the docs. https://medium.com/activewizards-machine-learning-company/top-20-python-libraries-for-data-science-in-2018-2ae7d1db8049
That top 20 list is just what I needed. Thanks.
After the logware scandal (others already posted links), I am not sure how could Kite redeem themselves. If you are going to use their tools you run a real risk of your source code and your typing habits going to unwanted places. Stupid example: let's say you often type password = "hunter2" in your config.json file There is a real risk of that leaking into general view. Sure Kite will say that your information will not be shared, but how can you trust them?
Not being a coder it was nice to be able to read the original code. Those iterations were Klingon to me!
r/coolgithubprojects is nice
image editing too
no
Exactly, you can't. For that matter, the "telemetry" that Ms is injecting into all their new tools is also more than a bit concerning.
Just makes your code less readable
Only [a little way in](https://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonForProgrammers.html#useful-techniques) and I find 1. A function definition with the enclosed statement on the same line. 2. An import statement inside a class definition It can be done that way, but I don't think it is good to teach others to start Python programming like that.
Hey, i've been trying to do the same for quite some time. The only difference is that i'm visualizing some of the stats in Ploty's Dash. Any advice to getting live match data or player statistics (this seems almost impossible without paying for it )? Thanks!

Perfect.

I think I made one that's a bit more efficient, hope you like it! &amp;#x200B; from random import \* for i in input("&gt;&gt;&gt; "): print((i.lower() if randrange(11) &lt;= 5 else i.upper()), end = "")
That's a broad subject which spans multiple areas. &amp;#x200B; Usually it all starts with an hotword detector which runs continuously in the background, something like [snowboy](https://snowboy.kitt.ai/). &amp;#x200B; Next you'll have some Speech To Text processing which convert well ... speech data to text. You can use [DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech) as @Attox8 suggests or look at other alternatives, either from [Google](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/), [Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech-to-text/) and the like or some other open source projects like [cheetah](https://github.com/Picovoice/cheetah). &amp;#x200B; Then, convert the text to something more meaningful to your program: intents and entities. There are already some nice open-source libraries out there, like [rasa](https://rasa.com/docs/nlu/) or [snips-nlu](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-nlu). &amp;#x200B; And finally, answer back to the user using some Text To Speech engine such as svox pico which works pretty well and doesn't need an internet connection. &amp;#x200B; This article helped me a lot when I tried to figure out how things work: [https://chatbotsmagazine.com/contextual-chat-bots-with-tensorflow-4391749d0077](https://chatbotsmagazine.com/contextual-chat-bots-with-tensorflow-4391749d0077), and how the already mentionned bag of words stuff can help you. I personally now use snips-nlu in my [personal project](https://github.com/atlassistant/pytlas) to classify inputs and extract entities from user inputs because that's easier and well maintained.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but instead of defining and incrementing x, can't you just use y instead?
Nice
Thanks guys! This is my most popular post. This and my previous one are almost at 200 where most of my others barely reach 15.
Depends, I asked my coworker, which one is more readable and since he works mainly with node and react, he said that using map, reduce, etc. makes code more readable for him.

Mostly preference. [This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1247486/list-comprehension-vs-map) thread explains it clearly.
Alright, you win
Here’s an idea, looks like your upper casing every second letter, so why not loop around the string (as your aleeady doing) and compare the iteration count. Like IterstionCount % 2 == 0 If it’s true upcase else lowercase it.
[[Github](https://github.com/christag/passwordpub)] My goal for this project was to learn how to create a Python application that can be called upon over HTTP with REST methods. This expanded into learning more about pytest, Travis, docker, and git. [How to Use It] Although not well documented (yet) you can modify the parameters of the password generation by adding parameters to the URL. For example you can set the maximum characters to 40 by going to: https://passwordpub.com?max_char=40 You can also get a plaintext password at https://passwordpub.com/api. The same parameter rules apply here. For a list of all the options, see the readme file. In your own build, the default options for generation can be set by environment variables or a config file. [Feedback] I am really looking for as much feedback as possible as this is my first project and I'm sure that I could have done a lot of things better. Thanks everyone!
only "is not 0" will work
after attempting to run this, my idle won't start anymore. I'm a noob. Any ideas? The GUI flashes and disappears when I attempt to start from the start menu
no
Python treats numbers &gt;0 as True and 0 as False. Having the ==1 there is like 'if True is True' rather than just 'if True'
0*
Please take it as constructive criticism and as a fun learning opportunity. Python is fun because it seemingly can always be made shorter (and less readable, shorter != better!) You have a fun concept here and lots of folks are having fun playing around with it. Nice job!
Functional life!

I went to your history to look at questions you've asked. The only one I see is a rant where scripting is too boring for you and never works. The reason it never works is because you don't know the basics and you are too bored to learn them.
I second the comprehension. They so good.
I think that whoever posts async/await for the performance improvement is missing the underlying point of async. Async enables a completely different programming paradigm in a standard way: event driven programming _and_ inline callbacks. Nothing of this is really new. Twisted has been doing the same since quite a while, but when you have an event loop the event loop is specific for the framework you use, _and_ the general approach is to rely on callbacks to handle the satisfied asynchronous request. This often (always) results in "callback hell" where you have callbacks doing async requests themselves and leading to callbacks upon callbacks upon callbacks. With async, you are flipping this mess on its head, and basically have straightforward "callbacks" as yielding points. This is nothing new and has been done in the pre-preemptive kernels as collaborative multitasking for processes. async is awesome because it's a complete new, old way of programming in python for highly IO-oriented tasks. The speed increase is the obvious result, but it's just the result of a larger paradigm.
Yeah. Not much is given on how to use it
I can’t tell if people are being jerks or not lol
Oh yeah, whoops, I was using it in the REPL.
I agree, good post, friend.

Here is my take on it: def main(): sentence = input("Type your sentence: ") sarcasm = ''.join([c if i%2 == 0 else c.upper() for i, c in enumerate(sentence)]) print(sarcasm)
[did you even run it before saying no?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQ3TM-p2QI) &gt;&gt;&gt; import random &gt;&gt;&gt; s = "is this better" &gt;&gt;&gt; "".join([c.upper() if random.randint(0,1)==1 else c.lower() for c in s]) 'Is ThIs bEtTEr' &gt;&gt;&gt; "".join([c.upper() if random.randint(0,1) else c.lower() for c in s]) 'IS thiS beTTER'
No. `if` does not only check for the literal Boolean `True`. It checks for true-like which is anything nonzero or nonempty or not None and of course `True`. Go try it yourself in the command line.
Super... but in order to actually explain why "Async" is awesome, you have to first explain how this is better than a (syntactically and conceptually much simpler) ThreadPool.
For this level of stuff you'd do much better in r/learnpython. Not being mean or anything, seriously it's a fantastic community. This sub is more for meta and higher level discussion pertaining to Python, from what I've observed anyway :)

The interesting things about python's asyncio is that with full syntax support for async, you programs start to look just like traditional threaded code, but with nearly everything async def'd. Turns out that a fully async concurrent application is doing EXACTLY the same thing as a multi-threaded version. The only difference is that context switches are explicit (at await points) instead of relying on the OS kernel scheduler. I don't really see much need for callbacks once you have coroutines. You still need synchronisation primitives like Locks, Conditions, etc.. Their usage is slightly reduced if you need to do a complex state-manipulation in-process, you can create a critical section simply by not awaiting. For out-of-process state changes, you still need locks, queues and whatnot where concurrent IO is interacting with a shared resource. asyncio Tasks have some nicer features compared to threads (you can cancel them, for example). Debugging async concurrent code is, paradoxically, harder than for multi-threaded code. If you want to step through code using a debugger, you can step through individual threads while other non-interesting threads run on in parallel. I.e. the debugger knows what thread is running at any time. For async code, this doesn't work because all tasks run in the same thread. How can a debugger know which task should be stepped through, and which should run as normal? You end up stepping through ALL tasks/context-switches which is not necessarily what you want. This is a tooling/debugger problem though which I'm sure will be fixed in time (maybe it already has - someone can enlighten me).
I like this, simple and understandable and doesnt use dunder methods. heres the code thats a bit more legibile. import random def sarcasm(s): return "".join([c.upper() if random.randint(0,1) else c.lower() for c in s]) print(sarcasm("Is this better?"))
I think he makes it clear in the intro that it's ["Not an Introductory Book"](https://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Introduction.html#not-an-introductory-book) but yeah I see your point.
So as you just said it's not exactly true: ```python if r: # do something else: # do something else ``` is equivalent to: ```python if r != 0: # do something else: # do something else ```
Seems that way. Per the documentation for 1.6.0: &gt; Though it’s possible to install Scrapy on Windows using pip, we recommend you to install Anaconda or Miniconda and use the package from the conda-forge channel, which will avoid most installation issues.
If you have .xlsx files, aren't they essentially already XML? If you try to unzip the .xlsx it should give you the XML file? &amp;#x200B; I could be wrong about that but I remember reading something about doing that to try and get Excel files under git version control
it seems like docs from [https://bitbucket.org/BruceEckel/python-3-patterns-idioms/src/default/](https://bitbucket.org/BruceEckel/python-3-patterns-idioms/src/default/) Which is moved here [https://github.com/BruceEckel/ThinkingInPython](https://github.com/BruceEckel/ThinkingInPython) and abandoned (is says so in readme)

Good point on the debugging, I had not thought of that. Given a newly developing program, being created for users to use on a PC, which will run lots of SSH commands for processing data on a remote server, would you go with Async or Threads?
I don't think they should teach such things as idioms. It's hardly Pythonic - If the author is new to Python then he may work at odds with practiced norms.
Kite doesn't exactly have a great reputation for doing the right things either.
It also does spongemocking, but uses only elements' symbols, i.e. SPoNGeMoCK is sulfur-polinium-nitrogen-germanium-molybdenum-carbon-potassium.

def funny\_case(msg): return "".join(\[x.upper() if random.random() &lt;= 0.50 else x.lower() for x in msg\])
i feel like it's better to be explicit in these cases. the space obtained is minimal, while there is a loss in clarity. the only exception i have is the python check for whether something is not none, otherwise i feel like it's best to make the boolean value explicit..
Say you're on Windows and a new version is released. Generally the first distribution that will be uploaded for that version is an source dist (which is compatible with Windows). When you pip install the package you will download the source dist. But minutes later the package author will upload a Windows binary wheel for that version. Next time you pip install the package, even if you specify that exact version, you will get the Windows binary wheel instead (assuming this is a different machine/virtualenv that does not already have the source dist installed). So you will get different hashes, and potentially different behavior, for the same version. And there's no way to know in advance whether that's going to be the case when you download a source distribution.
Oh that's cool like NaH BrO
Oh I would love to see such a writeup! I'm in the middle of a project where I'm using paramiko SSH extensively to process remote data and haven't used async or threading yet but know I need to and so now need to determine which method will be better for my use case. To that end, I have this question: Using Async, and you determine the progress or a long running routine so we can update a progress bar in a GUI?
I don't think being explicit is the goal of these circle-jerky code minimization exercises

Not really advanced, but [this book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781784399788.do) at least covers pipelines and explains how stuff works under the hood. For other stuff you'll just have to find random tutorials online or read the docs, unfortunately.

There’s no pip option for download source? If they are different, the package is very poorly done. Why are you worried about comparing hashes? If this is for a production server and you’re really concerned, upload the files.

I have looked into machine learning a lot and I understand the concept and how it works, I just can't ever think of an idea I could use it for though. I can watch a video over an AI learning handwriting or pictures and it completely makes sense and I know I could do it, but I don't want to simply just copy someone elses work. I want my own AI but I have no idea what to even make
Finally someone did it :D (Seriously, I sometimes need this. For some special people in my life)
I am still surprised that seemingly advanced python users does not know that ``` "".join([c.upper() if random.randint(0,1)==1 else c.lower() for c in s]) ``` could (and should in my opinion) be written like this: ``` "".join(c.upper() if random.randint(0,1)==1 else c.lower() for c in s) ``` Situation where you have to explicitly use a list are quite rare and most of the time denote a poor design of the called function. Generators are iterables themselves without using a list and they have the advantage to be lazy (which means less memory used and computation only when needed). Of course here it is not really important but it is still good to know. PS: For crazy minifiers, spaces are optional between ponctuation and keywords: ``` def sarcasm(s): return "".join(c.upper()if random.randint(0,1)else c.lower()for c in s) ```

I don't know about Tkinter, but pandas is python3 compatible. If you are just starting out, you might as well do use python 3.
I recently migrated a 20k-30k lines of code web app from Python 2 to Python 3. I used the 2to3 tool that comes with Python, and it did most of the work. You still need to manually check its output because sometimes it breaks your code, and then re-test your whole system, through both automated and manual tests. I spent more time re-reading the resulting code and testing than I actually spent modifying the code. It was a way better experience than I expected.
3+ hour long sessions...? Yikes. I just scrubbed through one to see if it just wasn't edited down, but the same guy at the podium for all 3 hours. I need to find some time this weekend to get through 1 or 2 of those Skikit-learn vids. Thanks for posting!
My hot take is that even though pylint prefers using ints as bools, I think explicitly writing out "if r == 1" is better. That way, you don't have to know all the rules about which numbers are "truthy". But that's a good thing to keep in mind.
I'm thinking you could set the actual external file gathering as a function, and include the time.sleep to run that function at the same time each morning, but this would free you up to create whatever menu you want to interact with during said sleep time. This way, the time.sleep is associated with the function instead of the whole script.
Well, that's all I wanted.

I just got into Python this week and I've only taken one computer science class in high school (long time ago). The impetus was being annoyed that the "Spelling Bee" quiz on New York Times wouldn't provide solutions until the next day and its ruleset was unique enough that I couldn't use an existing "solver" effectively. I was blown away at how easy it was for me to throw something together using Stackexchange answers (for loading a text file, namely a word list) and a couple humble 'for' loops to come up with a working solution! I thought things would end there but then my wife complained about the difficulty of precisely splitting restaurant bills for large groups (she runs a food meetup). I decided to really challenge myself this time, and I'm in WAYYY over my head, but after two days I've actually got a functioning program that solves the problem about as efficiently as I could imagine... you "click and drag" to select the relevant portion of the receipt, 'Google Vision' handles the text and my code puts it into a list of items and prices, then I used PyQt5 to put that list into a table that you lets you drag and drop the items into tables for each guest (this was actually the hardest part since any error in the PyQt5 stuff would just crash the program without telling me what went wrong) and it automatically updates to tell you what each person owes based on what you enter for tip/tax: &amp;#x200B; [https://i.imgur.com/Iie5E2U.png](https://i.imgur.com/Iie5E2U.png) (Sample) &amp;#x200B; I'm pretty proud of it! Now to figure out how to actually get it to run on Android/IOS so its not just a Desktop relic. I'm split between just trying to get it run as a package on our phones, trying to rewrite in a compatible language for our phones (big oof), or figuring out how to get it to run from a website (biggest oof?).
Fair enough. Thanks for pointing this out.
You could create another external file with the instructions to be executed.
Oof. Today there are some free sponsor workshops. There's still two afternoon sessions
Pumped to add another tool to the belt! Just one more reason to develop in the Linux ecosystem (:
Yeah. I left the education summit to do some workshops myself because the one about Geocoding is really relevant for an app I've been slowly working on for the last year
Maybe I'll see you there. I have my reddit username on my nametag
1. /r/learnpython 2. Profile your code. 3. How are you deploying your application?
I just want to thank you for voluntarily explaining the code.
Hi thanks for replying. I am using UWSGI to deploy using nginx.
That's why I love the python community. We all talk about improvement, rather than regression.
Then start by profiling your code.
&amp;#x200B; `if r == 1:` should be `if r &gt;= 1:` , right?
 from random import choice def sarcasm(sentence): casers = [str.lower, str.upper] return "".join(choice(casers)(c) for c in sentence) print(sarcasm(input("Type in sentence: ")))
Are you processing the data that you are getting back from your DB? Reason I ask is that you'll need to evaluate if your code needs to be optimised or your SQL queries.
There is a pip option for source (--no-binary); most people don't use it though, and you (generally) don't want to, because the setting applies to everything you download with that pip invocation, not just the one package (this is definitely a shortcoming of the tooling). &amp;#x200B; I agree that bundling the files you depend on in production is generally a good idea. But some people advocate hash checking everywhere, and furthermore those people put that behavior in the tools they build (e.g. pipenv), and so it affects lots of users.
No I am not processing the data heavily. But I am combining results of several queries. I have worked on queries and optimised them. Is there any other way to optimize or should I switch to Async framework?
 from random import randint as rand def sarc(unsarc: str) -&gt; str: return "".join([s.upper() if rand(0,100) &lt; 50 else s for s in unsarc.lower()]) print(sarc("python sucks"))
Even more concise `import random;f=lambda s: ''.join(random.randint(0,1)and c.upper()or c.lower()for c in s);f('Is this better?')`
If you've already optimised your SQL, then multi-threading or async are the only options.
Sure! It came to my mind to try changing your script to use a list comprehension after I looked at one of u/tombardier's comments. I first began by turning your loop into a list comprehension which you may read more about [here](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/list-comprehensions-in-python), it can be a little confusing at first but it's simple stuff! [choice((c.upper(), c.lower())) for c in answer] This list comprehension will perform an iteration through all of *answer*'s characters and the function *choice* of the *random* module which purpose is to return a random item from a sequence of items will be called for every character, a tuple containing the uppercase and lowercase version of the character will be passed to it. Once the list comprehension finishes a list containing all the results of *choice* will be returned which I will then join with a single space character and print it. &amp;#x200B; In my second script snippet I changed it so that that it may be used from the command-line. I imported the *argv* variable from the sys module so I may get the command-line arguments that were passed to the script, and the path module from the os module so that I may use *basename* to retrieve only the script's filename from the first argument of argv which is always the filename of the script and in some situations it includes the full file system path to it. After all the modules and functions are imported I check whether or not the script was passed any command-line arguments. If none were passed an usage demonstration is printed, otherwise the result of the result of the list comprehension is printed. `' '.join(argv[1:])` will strip the first item that is always the filename of the script from the list of arguments stored in argv and join all of them. The arguments in the command-line are space-separated so I use this trick to avoid having to use the script like so `py sarcastic.py "Double quotes would be necessary without this trick"`. &amp;#x200B; In my last code block I pasted the output of my Bash shell after writing the script to a file named sarcasm without any file extension so that it looks like an executable, moved it to somewhere executable are accessible system-wide, and simply entered the script's filename. Here's a Windows command prompt usage demonstration. C:\&gt;py sarcasm.py usage: sarcasm.py TeXt to TurN sarcastIc liKE thiS C:\&gt;py sarcasm.py Extremely useful, isn't it? EXTREMely UsefuL, ISN't IT?
I am also inclined to async since in a single function I am combining results of various queries to form the final dataset to return.
Should have looked at this earlier, I was actually in the same workshop lol
Wow! What’d you think of it?
Thanks, how long have you known python?

I will always upvote Dabeaz, but hearing “nothing practically useful” in the first sentence fills me with joy.
Sure, nothing wrong with doing it that way, but the only number you have to remember otherwise is 0. Everything else (including negative numbers) is evaluated as True.
I think it strikes a nice balance between brevity and verbosity too :)
It was okay. It would have been a lot more helpful if the instructor sent out the GitHub url and slides before hand so I didn't spend like 3/4 the time setting my environment up (I'm a backend Dev mostly so my computer doesn't have anaconda set up) what about you?

Definitely.. Not trying to lie my way through an interview. As i mentioned in my post, I didn't add anything more about my experience with python, just that i had a basic understanding of it. I'm more amazed that I got the call from the recruiter seeing that it relies a lot on experience with python or R.
This is neat. Thank you so much.
Yeah. I really liked it. I was sitting near the front so the urls weren’t that big a problem for me but downloading everything was. Their stuff was exactly what I was looking for in an app I’m building that allows travelers to upload and share their trips using pins they’ve saved from an app that uses openstreetmaps

I'm disappointed that every comment here isn't in alternating upper and lower case letters.
It is actually very useful. There's tons of amazing research being done in lambda calculus and type theory. The applications that first come to mind would be - automatic program generation, from properties/other specifications - optimization of code - proving things about your code, like correctness or certain invariants Compared to Physics and Biology, Computer Science is a newborn field. Just around 100 years ago we had the secrets revealed to us by Church, Turing, Godel and Neumann. (There were a few others before who worked on computation, like Ada Lovelace) - It has been less than a 100 years since we made the first actual computers (Turing Complete). - Less than 50 years since the general public got to know about it. - Less than 20 years since they became a household thing. There's still a huge amount of amazing research that can be done in Computer Science, and this field of theoretical computer science - lambda calculus, type theory, complexity classes are some of the most interesting fields. Recently some other fields like Machine Learning have gained a lot of attention, but there's potential (and some solid papers) attempting to merge the two sub-fields.
Why not iterate and print every character simultaneously in one pass? O(n) 😁
Alright. I’ll keep an eye out
Nice, I was kinda working on something like this last summer, built half a UI, then got distracted and haven't had time to work on it since.
What webserver are you using? Nginx defaults for the number of cores in the system and then you tune how often the worker processes restart. But yes it depends on number of users and how long it takes to fully serve a request and close the connection. Do not use the flask web server in production as that is just asking for trouble.
I started writing a web scraper last week as my first Python project. The web scraping book is good- and covers a lot of important redudancy and error handling work- but it feels like you can get the gist without having to make your way through 300 pages.

You are welcome! I haven't known Python for long but I have known other languages like Javascript for quite some time and because of how alike most programming languages are, knowledge is pretty interchangeable. I wish I could have given you some better explanations but I'm still learning too and I'm not used to giving explanations. Feel free to ask me about the stuff in my previous posts.
I'm thinking of using PythonAnywhere to deploy my site, and they offer the solution to select how many web workers I want. But I have no idea how much would my site need.
I think it's important to note that the upcoming event is Python 2.7 end-of-life. What that means in practice is that there will never be any core language updates nor will any support ever be offered again for the language version. &amp;#x200B; It does \*not\* mean that all of the sudden someone will flip a kill switch on Jan 1 2020 and your Python 2.7 applications will suddenly self-destruct. The language will simply revert to a "locked" form into perpetuity. &amp;#x200B; There are numerous systems around the world that still run on Fortan, COBOL, and other "dead" languages. The computers executing those instructions could not care less if the language from whence said instructions came is still "alive" or not. &amp;#x200B; Yes, it's important not to begin new development in Python 2.7 nor undertake any major new changes with the language, and if possible porting 2.7 code bases to 3 is of course recommended. &amp;#x200B; But let's stop sounding such loud alarms.

&gt; There is a pip option for source (--no-binary); most people don't use it though, and you (generally) don't want to, I very much agree with that. Compiling on windows is a nightmare. Ever try to compile scipy? &gt; But some people advocate ... and ... put that behavior in the tools they build (e.g. pipenv), and so it affects lots of users. So why do you use it? That's your choice to use a tool that very much does not have to do that. Pipenv is trying to "solve" a problem that depends on package requirements being accurate. Do I really need six 1.12 or would 1.9 be just as good? I dunno because I it's 2019 and I don't test 1.9 anymore, so I "dropped" support for it and bumped my requirements. It's all a lie anyways, so I just use pip.
 import requests ?
Sorry... Forgot to put that part into the post! In my code, I do have: import requests
I think you would want requests.request.get()
What would be a recommended order in going through the books for a novice with some background in other languages? I have been interested in python for a long time but don't know where to start
Just tried it... no change. Same error.
Are you running with the same python3 interpreter that you pip installed the module with?
Can you paste the real code, or a minimal example with the same error?
I'm trying to get my laptop running Windows 7 to work with Bluetooth using Python, then use it to communicate with a Raspberry Pi. I'm having no luck. Apparently, my socket library doesn't have the 'AF\_BLUETOOTH' function. Last week, I succeeded in using Python to read data from a Tristar Morningstar MPPT controller on both a Raspberry Pi and my Laptop using an RS-232 connection. Types of data: Charging State, Faults Raised, Alarms Raised, Voltage and Current of PV Array, Voltage and Current of Battery Array, Power Consumed per day, etc. I plan on sending this data through a Bluetooth connection.
These are the tutorials. The sessions are shorter and start tomorrow and run until Sunday

What happens behind the scene when it run upper or lower on the spaces?
Are you definitely using the same python interpreter you installed the requests package with?
Not sure about Flask, but found a formula for gunicorn serving Django and using it: cpu\_count() \* 2 + 1
Like, if you do sudo pip3 install, it might use a different python to the one you're using when you run as your unprivileged user.

How do I re-run the import section of the notebook? In the meantime, I'll try the other import urllib. Is that a package that I'll have to install as well, or would it already be installed?

Select the section in your notebook where you have the import statement, and run it just like you'd run the last section. Then go to the part where you use the request.get() and run that too.

Uh guys. This makes up more than half my karma. Thanks so much. All my old posts get 30 at most and today I uploaded a software gore and got a 200 and this post which got 550. I really appreciate it
If async was really standard, this would just work: def foo(): yield from async bar() Instead we have the same sort of bolted-on experience that we see with something like multiprocessing. And before we really dig into this and suggest that wrapping everything with async and an event loop is "the way it's supposed to be", I would counter with - we have had about 30 years worth of "synchronous" code and I want to control precisely when I use asynchronous within that synchronous code... I don't want to require rebuilding my synchronous code to utilize the new asynchronous syntax. Further - most of the examples I've ever seen with async are "simple" examples... which makes them "toy" examples. And while that's great to convey an idea, it doesn't make that a best practice for a building async into a full system.
I don't know if it's installed but from the console you can check it out by typing `pip freeze`, or if you use anaconda then `conda list`, and check if it's there.
Do you know what part takes the longest? Is it the querying or combining results? Can you have the db combine everything?
I appreciate it, thanks.
Attempt: py install requests pip3 install requests pip3.6 install requests &amp;#x200B; Most likely pip3 will work.
&gt; What that means in practice is that there will never be any core language updates nor will any support ever be offered again for the language version It's also important to note that some big enterprise players (e.g. Red Hat) bundle Python 2.7 with their offerings, and those offerings have longer long term support contracts. If you're running something like Red Hat, you'll keep receiving security patches for a few more years.
I recommend you [teamtreehouse.com](https://teamtreehouse.com), it's probably one of the best places to learn this language. But if you don't want to pay (which won't appeal to anyone who would otherwise like to teach you), just look up "python course" on youtube, you can find a lot of channels where the authors creates playlists for entire python courses.
I had tried pip and pip3. For pip3, it's saying that requests for 3.7 is installed, but I'll try 3.6 too!
That will be nice to have Python 2 out of the search results. Unfortunately a lot of the top search results will still be pretty bad, such as how the first result for a Google search of "python array" is an article about lists (W3Schools rubbish), not arrays.
ran sudo pip3 install requests and it said the same thing: Requirement already satisfied... but also: WARNING: The directory '/Users/____/Library/Caches/pip/http' or its parent directory is not owned by the current user and the cache has been disabled. Please check the permissions and owner of that directory. If executing pip with sudo, you may want sudo's -H flag. WARNING: The directory '/Users/___/Library/Caches/pip' or its parent directory is not owned by the current user and caching wheels has been disabled. check the permissions and owner of that directory.

Better yet. Let's say you can trust them. Like you could look inside their head and see they mean well. Did they keep a copy? Did they get hacked? Would you ever even know? And if you use that plug-in and they get hacked, will you get fired? Will you get sued? Will you even know that, while it traces back to you, it was actually them? Even if they're only using it to collect things like what language you used, it's way too risky.
Thanks for sgqlc. It would be nice if it provided help with pagination. I found it really cumbersome to do manually especially with more than one level.
I'm an aerospace engineer and I'm sick of maintaining python 2.7 code. If there's a github with some tests, I can port the thing.
I'll give it a try when I get home from work.
Did you re-run the section where you imported them?
&gt;import random def sarcasm(s): return "".join(\[c.upper() if random.randint(0,1)==1 else c.lower() for c in s\]) print(sarcasm("Is this better?")) What does the "(s)" do?
same idea by allows you to print multiple times to see which looks best. import random, sys def sarcasm(inp): out = [] for y in range(len(inp)): if random.randint(0,1): out += inp[y].upper() else: out += inp[y].lower() return "".join(out) inp = input("enter sentence: ") if len(sys.argv) == 2: for x in range(int(sys.argv[1])): print(sarcasm(inp)) else: print(sarcasm(inp))
Well, shortest.
you can remove the extra parenthesis `"".join((random.choice((str.upper, str.lower))(c) for c in s))`
One thing you can do is to build a thin wrapper around psspy and replace that with a dummy implementation for testing. This could enable you to test your application with both Python 2.7 and 3.4. Writing code that works on both versions is not that hard, but it's of course easier to do so from the beginning than to port it over later.
Doesn't mean they shouldn't have started their porting efforts 5-8 years ago. Every line written in 2.7 since then is technical debt. If you run polyglot for a while, the ugly incantations this forces you to sing are technical debt, too, until you can finally axe legacy python and move everything to sweet sweet python 3.
Simple app like that should be developed in Python3, and tested for both Python versions. That psspy API, your interface to it, won't change. That option widget with 33 and 34 should be bind to a method that will run the program with another Python version with subprocess.Popen and sys.exit(0) afterwards.
Another idea. Since apparently you're trying to do webscraping with BeautifulSoup, this link will show you how to do it according to plan: [https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#making-the-soup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#making-the-soup) `from bs4 import BeautifulSoup` `with open("index.html") as fp:` `soup = BeautifulSoup(fp)` `soup = BeautifulSoup("&lt;html&gt;data&lt;/html&gt;")` There is no using requests in this.
You say you are using anaconda. When you type `sudo pip3 install requests` your system is probably finding the system's python/pip and not anaconda's pip. Install it via `conda install` instead, you may have to do so from the anaconda installation path for this to work.
Thanks... with this though, I'd have to download the html file first and then open the "local" (to my machine) copy, and parse that, correct?
That seems like it may have worked... I'm no longer getting the name error at least! I'll keep trying to make sure!
I haven't used BS4 for a while, and apparently I lost my earlier webscraping files which I just found out now when I was looking for them to give you the code how I did it, but I don't recall it saving the html file locally, it only copies it into memory. Then you parse it and traverse it. Note that this won't work on JavaScript content (like sections loaded with Ajax), that won't be loaded with the HTML if you use BS4, you need to use a web driver for it. Anyhow, reading the docs will help.
I like this.
With any IT job, you need to troubleshoot problems. Since your script didn't work the first time, you gave up because "It’s boring as fuck and stupid". But that's the job...troubleshooting. It seems you aren't cut out for IT work. The jobs that you are qualified for are very low level support jobs and since you get bored so easily and don't care about the basics, you will not last long in one of them. If I were you, I'd figure out an alternative to IT work.

If you’re looking for another interesting aspect to this exercise, consider making the output more readable. For example, don’t ever put a lower case L next to an upper case i. It’s a fun typography rabbit hole to explore letter combinations from that point of view and a fun code challenge to apply that kind of rule set to your code.
There is a function in Windows (I can't recall where exactly but you can find it in google I'm sure) as well as Linux, and I'm pretty sure on Mac too, what you can use to execute files once every X time has passed, so you don't need a Python script continually running in the background. I'd also set up a file or a database entry (if you have local database installed anyway) what each file checks initially at the beginning of their run, so they can see whether they need to execute or they need to stop. And you can manipulate the database entry from another file what you only run when you need to do such manipulation.
Also, for proof of the whole shorter != better, check out code golf.

That's true, but things will start falling apart if you will continue developing the app. For example EOL for 2.7 is something that many package authors are waiting for so they can drop 2.7 support. Maintaining code that's compatible with 2.7 and 3 makes the library's code ugly and hard to maintain. So I would expect seeing things gradually breaking apart. I think 2.6 is a good example, you can install another package through pip it seems to install fine, and then on some operation crashes, because author started using dict comprehension which 2.6 doesn't support.
&gt; Situation where you have to explicitly use a list are quite rare and most of the time denote a poor design of the called function. I do not want you as a coworker

Depends on your priorities. Either approach works. If you're in a hurry and are already comfortable with threads, I'd say sticking with what you know is the most efficient approach. Unless you expect to have &gt;100 threads, you won't have performance issues. However, asyncio IS cool and is worth learning so if you're up for the learning experience, I'd say go with async. I've just got going on this with a QT-based GUI asyncio program (in my case, I'm doing hardware comms over CAN sockets and serial ports). For Qt, there's a library which lets you use the Qt eventloop as the asyncio eventloop ("quamash" I think it is called). This means you don't need threads at all and everything runs in the Qt eventloop. This is the easiest approach and fine for all but very high performance IO apps.

Maybe make tutorials and offer to teach people and/or sell your code also freelance...
You're looking at this the wrong way. What sort of company needs to hire you specifically for Keras. Answer: A company that has no developers. Any dev should be able to pick up a library like Keras and run with it. You now need a compelling argument for them to hire you, as opposed to a consulting business. I would argue it is in the best interest of the company to never hire you, as the consulting business will have superior guarantees. Particularly since you're not going to be there in person.
Hmm python 3.4 is quite old although looks like there was 3.4.10 version released in March... If you have to write in python 2.7 I would encourage to import from \_\_future\_\_ everything that's available and make code work with it, at very least: absolute_import, division, print_function the unicode_literals is a bit of a minefield and you need to know what you're doing, but division is especially important since the change could introduce many subtle bugs. There are various other things you could do, for example write your code in python 3.x and the part that communicates with PSS/E in 2.7 and then invoke the 2.7 code from command line. Whether it is suitable or not depends how you'll use the PSS/E. There seems like might be a possibility to use Cython to combine Python 2 and 3 together, I never did it myself, but I found a blog post speculating about it: https://matthewrocklin.com/blog//work/2018/11/28/python-2-and-cython Although I would rather try to compile PSS/E so it could be imported on Python 3 than doing it the other way, since you might just make it even harder for yourself.
There’s a chance your code just ends up shouting at them!

AFAIK tkinter is part of the python so that should work, also pandas is one of packages that plans to drop python 2.7 support on or before 2020: https://python3statement.org/
no offence but everybody can copy paste keras code to build NN. The art is to understand why you would need to build one and how to tune it. Most companies usually hire ppl with masters in math for that.
Using python to make me write my name and then it tells me to fuck off and then my name using a variable until I learn how to do stuff
That's really cool and I think that this might be the most practical implementation of OP's idea yet! I am happy to have found out about pyperclip. from time import sleep import pyperclip import keyboard # Python may not change the case of these letters as intended. ignored_chars = ["ö", "ä", "ü", "ß"] # Alternate the case of all the letters of the clipboard's text sequentially. def callback(): # A very small delay is required for the paste function to work, at least on Windows. sleep(0.1) text = pyperclip.paste() if not text: return result = '' for c in text: if not c in ignored_chars: result += c.upper() if result[-1:].islower() else c.lower() pyperclip.copy(result) # callback is called every time Ctrl+C is pressed anywhere whenever this script is running. keyboard.add_hotkey("ctrl+c", callback, args=()) # Listen forever for the hotkey. keyboard.wait() I have changed your script so that it not will only change the contents of your clipboard but it will automatically do so whenever it is running, using another super useful Python library called [keyboard](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard). A little clarification: `result[-1:]` will get the last character of *result*.

One GUI option is to use [PySimpleGUI](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org) for your GUI. There is both a 2.7 and 3 version available. Additionally, when you move over to Python 3 you will be able to run other ports of PySimpleGUI (Qt, WxPython, browser based) without modifying your GUI code. In theory, it should "just work", by changing the import statement. You should have very little trouble moving your existing tkinter code over from 2.7 to 3. PySimpleGUI also moves from 2.7 to 3 with little trouble when using on top of tkinter. In general, Legacy Python (2.7) should be avoided for all new projects unless you absolutely have to use it, which you have clearly laid out an excellent and detailed list of why you need to be on 2.7. Not being familiar with Python 3 or having some kind of fear of Python 3 is not a valid reason for using 2.7 (I only mention it because I've heard that fear excuse on more than 1 occasion).
Not sure why you were downvoted, that's actually a rational thing. The main reason for API is so it is something standardized if it changes often it hardly can be called an API. BTW: I have some concerns around Python 3.4, looks like 3.4.10 which was released this March is the last version and it is EOL (actually before 2.7 :) I don't understand why psspy supposed to be only for 3.4 there aren't major changes all until 3.6 (3.7 is a bit different story because it made word "async" a keyword, so some apps that used it as a function name or parameters broke)
Corey Schafer on YouTube has great guides on fuckloads of python stuff
I feel the same way.
&gt; That way, you don't have to know all the rules about which numbers are "truthy". IMO, the easier way is just to remember which values are 'falsy'. In Python, there aren't too many: * Empty anything (list, dict, set, tuple, etc.) * None * False (obviously) * 0 or 0.0 * Custom objects with \_\_len__ returning 0 or \_\_bool__ returning False If you can remember those 5 (really 4) categories as 'falsy', then everything else is 'truthy'.
&gt;You need to set &gt; &gt;SO\_BROADCAST &gt; &gt; on your socket before you can &gt; &gt;sendto() &gt; &gt; to broadcast addresses. Also, whatever you're trying to do, UDP broadcast is very likely not the way to do it. Thanks it work on simple socket example (without asyncio). Do u know how to set SO\_BROADCAST in asyncio? I write discovery service on Python to search neighborhoods instance of my application. It similar Consul behavior but it should be embedded in my Python solution. Do u have idea how to better way to implement it?
Untrue. Bad bot.
Thanks. Can't wait for second edition.
This saved my butt today!
&gt;I don't understand why psspy supposed to be only for 3.4 I believe that's the minimum Python version to work with psspy (or to say that Python 3.3 isn't compatible with).
Here's my take: from random import choice values = [True, False] sentence = input("Input a sentence: ") output = "" for letter in sentence: if choice(values): # There's no need to write 'if choice(values) is True:' output += letter.upper() else: output += letter.lower() print(output) I guess you could use `pyperclip` to make this script more useful. Maybe put the code inside an endless loop too.
I have 2 issues. 1: you need to put lists=[] at the beginning. 2: Mine won't print the final product for some reason.

Unfortunately it's a C# WPF application, native to windows and quite extensive. Thus, writing a new GUI isn't an option.
Probably a stupid question, but why is len() used here? I’m still learning python and I’m still trying to figure out how len() is used in cases like these.
Yeah, haskell core for example is built on system F[C], which is a typed lambda calculus. I don't really know the history, but I'm pretty sure that goes back at least a couple decades. In some senses haskell itself is really just a typed lambda calculus.
Something to add to this; due to the way floating point numbers are stored in a computer you only actually have 16 decimal places of precision (for a 64 bit python float). If you want to do calculations with more decimal points, you'll need a library that offers larger floats.
Have you tried using gunicorn with an async worker, such as eventlet (to serve the flask app)?

I would prefer version with function and list comprehension. Much more readable for me – and more pythonic solution overall. ``` In [1]: def random_to_lower_or_upper(i: str) -&gt; str: ...: r = random.randint(0, 1) ...: return i.upper() if r %2 else i.lower() In [3]: sentence = "typing like this" In [4]: "".join(random_to_lower_or_upper(i) for i in sentence) Out[4]: 'TyPiNg LiKE THIS' ``` (or better – `"".join(i.lower() if random.randint(0, 1) else i.upper() for i in sentence)`)
Yup. Number 5 doesn't come up very often in beginner code, and number 3 is straightforward, so 90% of the time you'll probably only be dealing with 3 falsy objects that aren't False itself.
You should check out the stackexchange for code golfing, it's an absolute blast and beginners are always welcome.
I'm so excited for the Python 3.8 assignment expression. I think it's going to be my new favorite addition in a long time.
The PSS/E API itself doesnt change. This API can be accessed from Python, Fortran, and Batch Files. What changes is psspy, which is a module that allows the API to be accessed from Python. I have been researching and brainstorming ways to use psspy on newer versions of Python, but have come up short. Below is an answer from a PSS/E with Python forum. It is before version 34 was released with Python 3.4, but presents the same issue: "PSSE 32 uses Python2.5 for its psspy and other library files. PSSE 33 uses Python2.7 for its psspy and other library files. But I haven't seen a version yet that comes ready for Python 3 That leaves the option for porting their psspyfile. The problem though is that they only distribute a pyc file, which is the Python bytecode file, compiled for a specific version - so we don't have access to the source code. The psspy.pyc file calls a Python pyd file which is a compiled library type file for Python. It looks like we can't port because both of these files are compiled against a specific Python version (2.5 or 2.7)."

The other answers so far are focused on the number represwntation itself,, but I see that you are specifically asking about printing with a given number of digits. Yes, you can do that easily by using a special String-Format character if you convert it to String before printing. See this link for info on how to do this: https://pyformat.info/#number_padding
Connecting two programs via TCP/IP should not require that. Just sending the data over the very local link to the python process, which displays/interpolates/returns data over the same link/etc. Alternatively, could you use c-bindings from c#? I've only ever called c-functions from python, but I guess it's possible to go the other way too... Edit: autocorrect
No! This is much harder to read.
Does it need to be random? I always thought it was alternating. So my version of OP's code would be: sentence = input("Type in a sentence: ") lists = list(sentence) for y in range(len(lists)): if y % 2 == 0: lists[y] = (lists[y].lower()) else: lists[y] = (lists[y].upper()) print("".join(lists))
The thing is, recruiters aren't necessarily on the same page as the employer! Just be careful! In my experience, recruiters can misrepresent the employer to the client, then misrepresent the client to the employer. They're just trying their luck!
I click on the Jupyter Application icon in the Server and it opens up the web browser on http://localhost:8888/tree Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard There are others who can access the server.

If you have prior coding experience, I would start with the official python tutorial. https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/ If there are particular aspects of the language you don't know how to do, there's a handy glossary right there that will take you to the appropriate section so your eyes don't glaze over reading through pages of stuff you're not interested in. And of course if you get tripped up along the way or there's something you can't seem to find the answer to, r/learnpython is always there for extra sets of eyeballs.
