Thanks for the help teaching me a whole bunch last time guys! Here's what I've been able to learn from it since then. Think I might give my lecturer a heart attack! [https://pastebin.com/Jt5fXZzR](https://pastebin.com/Jt5fXZzR)
Ooo I really like that "grades are great for eggs and beef" but not necessarily learning. I 100% agree! 
There might be an empty line or commented line in the file. So when you `.split(":")` it's not what you expect. Try printing the values after you split.
no one/very few uses numpy? unlikely
It is not printing, I have looked through the file and I don't see any mistakes and it won't print values when I try to. Is there anyway I can contact you? It is due tonight...
Jesus fucking Christ. 1. /r/learnpython 2. Don't share code with images 3. A picture of your monitor? Really? 4. A *rotated* picture of your monitor? Really really?

I suggest you to check out [https://github.com/ambv/black](Black). It would make your code pretty and easy to read.
Add `print(line)` at the start of the for-loop after line 14. That should show you which line it is having an issue with.
Weird, I've just tried your code and it worked fine
/r/learnpython
Did you try rotating your screen counter-clockwise?
Did you try it on Mac or are you on a windows computer?
Mac
What do u think could be the problem?
It seems that `playskill` should really be an instance of a `Player` class, `brkln` a `break_line()` function, and `elif revert == 'y'` should definitely just be `else`.
Yeah I wrote half of this a week ago so it’s half out of date XD Thanks for the suggestions though!
Json... or yaml! 
Im teaching high school age students python right now and they are going to LOVE this! Thank you. 
Hey that's great! Please let me know there reaction haha
I've developed several webscrapers in selenium for the company I work for, and I am currently developing a script that interacts with a REST-based API that returns JSON encoded responses, and standard HTML response codes.
You say that the closer 2 technologies are together, the more often they are used together, but numpy and python are half the graphic away from each other. Have I been using numpy wrong?
I'm working on one as well! Perhaps we can compare notes and help each other? 
Rather than for line in lines, try for x in range(len(lines))... Line in lines always ends with an exception if I'm not mistaken(which I very well could be).
did you run it on mac and cheese?
I'm in accounting, and I had the exact same situation with a lot of man hours going into manual data entry into spreadsheets. Having working in both Python and VB, I would choose python every time. A lot of the databases the company worked with were third-party with no API access, so I created webscrapers and transferred that data into spreadsheets. In some situations, weeks of manual data-entry were reduced to minutes. So I would definitely recommend Python if it fits your situation. Hit me up if you need some advice or direction.
&gt; Learn to take a screenshot, not post a picture of a computer screen Learn to NOT screenshot. You don't edit your code with Photoshop, do you? Code is **text**, not pixels. Post text. Screenshots can't be copied and run, they make it difficult or impossible for the blind and visually impaired, and they can't be indexed by search engines. In my opinion, the *worst* technology decision of the last decade has been the rise of a generation of coders who don't know how to copy and paste their code when reporting bugs or asking questions. It displays a scary level of technical ignorance (not knowing how to use their own tools!) and a significant level of rudeness and unconcern for those they are asking help from. "Here's a picture of my code -- if you want to run it, you can re-type it yourself." 
We can not test and run your code if you provide it this way. Do you expect us to type all the code by ourselves? 
Downvoted for posting a photo of your computer instead of the source code you are using. For reasons I explained [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b19ckz/can_anyone_help_with_this_cant_figure_out_why_i/eikgfrf/), don't post screenshots or photos of your computer. Also make sure you post the **actual** code you are running. The error given comes from a line of code that doesn't appear in your supposed code. That proves that what you are running, and what you are showing us, are not the same code. 
You retyped the code from the photo? And *all* of their data? When you did, did you notice that the line of code that causes the error doesn't appear in the photo? `FG = float(values[1])` appears nowhere in the photo of the code, so you're trying to debug code by running *different* code. That's like the drunk looking for his lost keys under a lamp-post when he lost them half a block away in a dark alley, because the light is better. 
Gevent was a tool/hack to allow having concurrency in previous versions of Python, with an interface similar to multithreading. In newer versions of Python, you achieve the same things with asyncio, using async and await. Those are new, from recent versions of Python. They are way simpler to code and think about than multithreading (or Gevent). The default "event loop" in Python (for asyncio) was not that fast, but some guys created uvloop, a super fast implementation of that event loop. FastAPI uses those new ideas from asyncio (async and await), and using it with Uvicorn (as suggested in the docs) it uses that uvloop. If you are using Python 2.7 you have to stick to Gevent. If you can use Python 3.6 or above you should better use asyncio (and you can use FastAPI).
That's cool! It got quite some inspiration from Flask, and it was designed for APIs, so you should feel "at home" :)
&gt; What do u think could be the problem? Did you read the error message? It tells you exactly what the problem is. If you don't understand how to read the error message, start by posting the error message alone (copy and paste it as text, not a screen shot or a photo!) and ask for an explanation. You're trying to extract the list item in position 1 when the list doesn't have a position 1. Also you are running different code from what you took a photo of. Asking us to debug code that we can't even see is a very inconsiderate thing to do. Please try to do better next time. 
Yes, you are mistaken, badly. `for x in range(len(lines))` is an anti-pattern and `for line in lines` is the standard, idiomatic Python. Did you try it before making this claim about raising an exception? Its about five seconds to test in the interactive interpreter: for x in ["one", "two"]: print(x) to demonstrate that it doesn't end in an exception. 
Has anyone managed to get vpython to display within Jupyter Lab?
You did a good job on the docs, that’s always nice to see
&gt; Most IDEs allow you to hit SHIFT+ ENTER to go to the next line from the middle of the current line. Super useful for this exact reason. That's not "super useful", that's a work-around for a badly designed misfeature.
Yes, this is a horrible misfeature. Highlighting paired brackets is super-useful. Highlighting unclosed brackets is super-useful. Auto-completing brackets or quotes is a PITA.
I notice that you use expressions like if playerchoice == '1' or '2' or '3' or '4': That won't do what you think it does. The conditional is evaluated as (playerchoice == '1') or '2' or '3' or '4' Which always evaluates to True. If you want to check if something is one of several options, you could do something like this instead if playerchoice in {'1', '2', '3', '4' }:
Quart is also an ASGI implementation, so, you can also run Quart with Uvicorn. Their performance should be more or less comparable, although I haven't seen where it is on the benchmarks (if it's there). FastAPI is based on Starlette, another ASGI. Starlette is the fastest on benchmarks, so, FastAPI inherits that. Their difference is more on the features. Quart is more similar to Flask, it doesn't use Python types as parameters, automatic API docs, etc.
That's awesome to hear! Thanks!
Not yet :(. Django Admin depends heavily on the relational database and ORM used. And as FastAPI is database and ORM independent (there are even project generators for Couchbase and PostgreSQL) the same approach cannot be applied. I plan on building a generic frontend generated automatically from the OpenAPI (it wouldn't be exclusive of FastAPI). But for now, the project generators include a modern (Vue) frontend where you can login, manage users, account profile, change password...
That's awesome! I would love to hear how it goes :)
Thanks! I'm glad you're liking it. I tried to condense it here to not bore everyone :)
Thanks! I put a lot of effort into them :)
Yep: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/graphql/
The op said it was compiled by scrapping github. And those languages were further out then most of the other main languages. It would have been more accurate of me to say that they don't like github.
Yes, it's here: https://github.com/tiangolo/uvicorn-gunicorn-fastapi-docker Yes, it's being used in production with Docker. In my current team we use Docker Swarm. Microsoft uses it in production for ML APIs in Kubernetes.
Kubernetes? Kafka? Where you at?
I guess at about 3,000 to 10,000 requests per second (depending on the size of your servers). Nevertheless, even with Flask, you can always throw more money at it and spin up more servers. But, although the performance is the first thing checked, I think the main benefits in FastAPI are actually the other features, automatic data validation and documentation, etc.
Thats great really. Now you just need to keep adding more features to it for learning stuff like multithreading, sending/recieving files, sending file to server and server encrypting it.. stuff like that. Voila, you become 1/2 a hacker. You can then code Trojans. The most popular uses reverse_tcp connection. Other ones are reverse_http etc.. That means your server waits for connection &amp; then the client connects. Thats cool ;)
I’ve already made a reverse shell that when a client runs a script it automatically binds to my server and I have access to all cmd commands on their computer ;) 
Wait a sec, weren’t there some frequency counts of stack overflow questions to try and argue that those are the most popular languages? ... or did I make that up? The number of times I’ve read or heard to specialize in c# because that’s where the jobs are, and I’ve somehow managed to do fine without, and haven’t had a problem find work. 
If only there were a standard to unite them all
It would not be true to say that only Python is used in Data Science but yes Python is more prefer while working on data Science Project. Other programming language like R, java are also used in but the [concept of python](http://pythonandmltrainingcourses.com/courses/best-data-science-training-in-delhi/) is more essential . After the introduction of Panda library in Python , it became very advantage to use python instead of other language because of its features and advantages. python is always termed as best language for Data Science because: 1. It is easy to learn for the fresher 2. It has easy syntax 3. Interpreted language 4. It supports Dynamic typing 5. It is more flexible then other language 6. It is well structured.
Talk to guidance counselors and math/physics teachers. At the very least you can hopefully get approved to take an online course if there's not enough interest at your school to make it happen.

That's pretty cool. I've come to rely on django-admin for a quick and dirty adding of users, revoking tokens and other basic CRUD admin work. Although the solution you have with the Vue app might just hit my use case. Anyways congrats on a great looking lib!
thats great man. You'll grow more. Looking at your other scripts, it's good (those py scripts in sublime) &amp; you know some photoshot stuff too. Thats cool
Yeah, in TechEmpower benchmarks' Django is run with Gunicorn and Meinheld. Meinheld is another async server like Gevent (I understand Meinheld has a bit more performance than Gevent). And indeed it boosts performance over other options, like uwsgi (you can see and compare in the benchmarks). And in fact, I created Docker images for both approaches (for Flask, Django, etc). But the performance boost is not as big as having `uvloop` underneath, as would be with FastAPI running on Uvicorn. --- So, Django-REST-Framework was created by Tom Christie. The same guy then created APIStar, it was an application framework for creating APIs. Defining parameters and body types as function parameters. Then, Tom Christie created Starlette, and then he had to stop developing APIStar as a server and make it a set of tools for validating OpenAPI, etc. So, these tools were made from DRF's creator with all his experience. Then, FastAPI, is heavily inspired by APIStar, based on Starlette, and pushing a bit further, by using standard Python type hints. For more on previous tools, the things FastAPI learned from others and alternatives, you can see: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/alternatives/ --- FastAPI uses Pydantic, as it uses standard Python types for all its declarations, you have all the benefits, better editor support, autocomplete, type error checks, etc (even on deeply nested JSON documents/payloads). All that on top of automatic data validation, serialization, and documentation. For testing, it uses the same Starlette tools, which feels like just playing with `requests`. Writing tests is quite enjoyable (or almost enjoyable, depending on how much you like tests). https://www.starlette.io/testclient/ 
I'll say it right now. Wha da fug is "aingle core" ? &amp;#x200B; O\_O
Yeah, I think we are all learning and improving pretty fast. Sanic was the first one I saw of this type (I think the first one of them all), before there was a standard like ASGI that improves using and combining different tools. But it was a couple of years ago. Falcon uses a different style, you receive a request and a response as parameters in your function, and you take data from the request and assign data to attributes in the response. So, you don't declare the API as parameters in your function. So, it's not easy to get automatic data validation, serialization, and documentation. There are a couple "cousins" of FastAPI (based on Starlette) that use this same approach. Japronto was super fast for some things, as more or less "proof of concept", but was declared as not complete/production-ready yet. --- FastAPI's performance benefit compared to these other new high-performance tools is not that "impressive", you're probably fine with the others too if they satisfy your needs. Compared to them, what FastAPI puts into the table is automatic data validation, serialization, and documentation, all based on standard Python type hints (so you also get all the editor support). E.g. with FastAPI you get autocomplete everywhere, even for deeply nested JSON body requests. It also has a powerful but simple dependency injection system. In the case of FastAPI, you can just try it, it takes between 5 to 20 minutes, and you will already know if you like it or hate it. But more importantly, if it actually solves something and helps you and your team. --- Is not necessarily that requirements change that much, but the tools and ways to solve them do. For example, when Flask was created, there was not an API standard like OpenAPI, nor a JSON definition standard, like JSON Schema, and Python type hints were not available (from Python 3.6). FastAPI uses all that. So, the change is probably not much in the project requirements, but in the tools used to solve it, to allow better interaction with teammates (say, a frontend development team), better interaction with other systems (that can just plug to your documented API), better development experience with autocomplete everywhere, reducing the code you write by probably a half, and having a lot of the repetitive and delicate things done automatically for you, so, less development time.
It seems someone did :) &amp;#x200B; [https://github.com/nikelwolf/fastapi-realworld-example-app](https://github.com/nikelwolf/fastapi-realworld-example-app)

I need a way to check a big list of emails against the haveibeenpwned at work and issue a nice friendly email to the address if it was found.

Have you tried with the requests library? I've never had an ssl issue when using that library
From experience, .net developers are much less likely to be hobby programmers, and the companies they work for are much less likely to use github.
1. my first target was to compare tree sructures without pre-knowledge about there inner structure/grammer. 2. my second target was to make the resulting visible in a more intuitive way than printing text lines, moved, deleted, added and changed. Now the diff works better than a standard text diff, the meta language would be xml, but you could campare json or yaml as well. json/yaml/tree-&gt;xml-&gt;XmlXdiff-&gt;svg perhaps i will try to extend this stuff to XmlXdiffMerge
You can use the export your data feature introduced after the European privacy policy.
This looks pretty cool! Have you considered generating tests using [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)? I've really enjoyed using it, and it has native support for generating inputs based on type hints (or even regular expressions!). There's also [a bunch of 3rd party extensions](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/strategies.html), including to generate data from json-schema or OpenAPI schema. Put it together, and you could generate a test suite for any FastAPI app - failures would mean that you either have a logic bug, or need to tighten your input validation.
Python has nothing to do with this. It's the operating system that launches new, isolated process of Python for each script. You should be ok :)
Due to external constraints, one does not always have the freedom to use third-party libraries. Besides, if the issue can be solved there, it seems like it should be possible to fix the bug.
1/ No. 2/ It does not deal with this, that's why it works. Just like you can open several command prompts or calculators. More complex programs will not allow you to run several instances of themselves. 3/ An imported module or script is read and made part of the environment of the bigger program. Everything you import runs directly, but most of the time it's just functions and classes declarations and no actual processing. At this point I don't know how exactly the interpretor behaves, but I believe there's some optimisation going on. 4/ I've sometimes used virtualenv to wrap python environments. But those were Django servers. It is more about handling different library versions. 5/ Looks like an overkill to me. What you are asking about in these questions is mostly done by the OS. It manages access to the hard drives, allocates memory and processing time to processes. The python scripts read and ran by the python interpretor, which will be ran each time for each script. A process is not aware of other processes, and the OS just manages their access to physical ressources. I don't think this subreddit is for questions. There is one, but I don't remember it's name. Some good soul will remind it to us.
TLDR: working in asyncio motherfucking sucks. Framework doesnt support it.
You can also turn it off if You want to.
Probably more in internal projects that are not on github.

This isn't really a python question, it's an operating systems question, as that's what controls your processes once they're executing. The reason this is different from excel is that a spreadsheet needs to maintain its state and so two people editing the same file at the same time (before fancy google docs) is really problematic. With a short script, the whole thing just gets loaded at once and then whatever happened to where it came from is irrelevant.

interesting solution. Does it support me passing my own API definition for request/response validation? Because having documentation generated by implantation might not work for bigger projects, where you want to define API (contract) first and then have the implementation of it. 
awesome
Correct, most with their salt host their own git or Bitbucket
Nice graph. Are you willing to share the data?
Are you looking for something like [this from Quart](https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart/blob/master/quart/datastructures.py#L341) ?
Interesting stuff. Is the code knocking about ??
Maybe if companies names were in color or something...
This is awesome is it open source ? 
I can't even figure out hot tcp-ip works...
The plot functions in pandas are just wrapper of matplotlib. The really neat seaborn module also uses pandas dataframe and matplotlib. You cannot really separate them. Knowing that it depends of what you want to do. Personally, I use pandas every time I have to load data table, small or big. The syntax is super clean so it's faster to make things with pandas once you know how it works. Moreover, since pandas series can be iterated, you can use them in matplotlib functions. 
So basically no downside to always use Seaborne?
VSCode does that too.
Great work man ! Love your server attitude !
I wanna eventually post it on github or something and send it out. So people can see it and look at it and use it for their own use. It’s all stuff I’ve learnt online so why should I keep it to myself? Haha
That's why i used [https://github.com/Cornices](https://github.com/Cornices) they do by defining a schema + the swagger extension. &amp;#x200B;
I like your tool, but one thing that bugs me is that i have to use a "special" web tool for it. It would be nice if the `type-hints -&gt; generate swagger` could be extracted in a separate lib so i can use it in any `ASGI` capable framework.
Questions like this one are better asked in r/learnpython. &amp;#x200B; Matplotlib is used for visualization, Pandas for manipulating tabular data. Yes, Pandas has some [visualization capacities](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/visualization.html) `(DataFrame.plot` etc.) but those just use matplotlib under the hood. For basic plots, you can often get by with what's included in pandas but for fine-tuning and more specific kinds of plots, you can reach out to matplotlib.
Thank you sir. This will surely help many python learner. 
Cool! Gonna give this a shot. Thanks!
Poor James
If you're not afraid of pandas dataframe, I don't see big downside. However while seaborn offers several convenient functions, you will most likely still need matplotlib at some point in your project. 
r/learnpython
Nice, good job! How does/will your chat application differ from IRC for example? Or is this just meant for learning/practice?
More or less learning. I’ve now only just realised the potential of using sockets and threading. Haven’t really used them before so I’m really enjoying some of the applications you can make with it. This project is just more for learning how to handle multiple connections with different threads. Pretty pleased with the work I’ve made so far. Essentially just going update more functions of the server/client and see how far I can push it. 
Check out the socket and threading documentation and examples. Gives a lot of insight into how it works. I came across them trying to make a backdoor into client computers and hack their shit haha. 
You're welcome! Your question is a bit broader than just help with code, so I think it's okay to leave it. Maybe someone who knows more about Python's inner workings will have something to add.

That sounds very interesting! Thanks for sharing. I'll check it thoroughly.
Hmm, nope. Maybe I didn't explain it well. I think you can use Gevent, it just will be more difficult and you could achieve the same, more easily, with asyncio stuff. I don't know which framework you're referring to, FastAPI is built with the asyncio features, based on it.
Thank you! 
Not in FastAPI. Here you could create the stub with FastAPI and the data types in Pydantic (standard Python type hints), it's probably the same amount of code or less than declaring the spec in an external language (like YML with OpenAPI/Swagger). From that you get the spec/contract, and then fill the rest. It's like wiring "pseudo code"/spec first, just that that same Python stubs/"pseudo code" works afterwards, you just have to fill the rest. If your team is not familiar/comfortable with Python, then you're probably better with other tools. But I guess you're ok with Python as you are here ;)
Calm down I’m new to the sub

What program are you using?
I'm in the same boat - just starting out. What I've done is each day, come up with an idea like "how to calculate any day in the week from a date in history" kind of thing. I know there's code out there, but I made the effort to get the algorithm and then try and code it for myself. Took a couple of hours, had to google some code to get me through, but it was cool to see it work and I had figured out the bulk of it. Pick a new project each day. Today I'm telnetting (I know...) to a router and a switch, following David Bombal's videos on Youtube, "Python for Network Engineers". Tomorrow I'll pick something else. Just start doing little projects and putting code on the screen. Have some fun with it!
It’s all written in python and run through the command prompt in windows. Eventually I’ll turn it into a .exe application so you don’t need python to run it. 
Thank you. And keep me update 🙂

I guess Cornices (with Pyramid) would be equivalent to Flask with Marshmallow, Webargs, and Flask-apispec. In fact, it seems it also supports/uses Marshmallow. FastAPI learned a lot from those tools. The difference is that it's all integrated and based on Python type hints. So, no need for plugins, decorators, etc. And auto complete everywhere.
I was going to suggest web sockets or even web rtc though that's more for video and voice. 
Get fucked James.
You can generate the OpenAPI (Swagger) and use it however you want. But as each framework defines how to get request data, and send responses, you would need to handle passing those objects around, parsing and validating, etc. In that case, you probably would have to declare things in several places (for validation and then for documentation, for example). Making sure everything is synchronized, etc. For that, you can look at APISpec and the different extensions and plugins. The difference in FastAPI is that you use type hints *once* in the parameters of your function, and with that, it does validation, serialization, and documentation, automatically. If you update it, all that is updated/kept in sync for you. And by using standard Python type hints you get great editor support. Completion, type error checks, docs, etc.
Awesome! Let me know how it goes :)
I noticed the docker image pip installs fastapi without specifying a version. Couldn't this lead to future builds to the same image potentially bringing in breaking changes from future versions? 
Yep, and I haven't checked how it's done in that repo, maybe it's incomplete, but I guess it's close at least... It seems to be using the project generator: https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack-fastapi-postgresql If you have Docker, you can generate a full initial project (customized for your app), with the base template that you can extend and try it (in like 5 or 10 minutes).
For a second I thought it said copyright 2010, hey this isn’t new.
Yeah, it would be a good practice for you to specify the specific version of FastAPI you are using in your app (and any other libraries). But at least it has some version installed that should help newcomers start testing it quickly.
This is such a great project for beginners. It's not too difficult, yet you get a really cool final product and you'll learn a lot.
This is really cool. I’m just starting out on Django so this is very inspiring. 
Thank you. I've dive too much into data science lately and been out of the loop with the rest of Python.
Kinda late, I graduated 3 years ago haha
From the [benchmark](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=test&amp;runid=a979de55-980d-4721-a46f-77298b3f3923&amp;hw=ph&amp;test=json&amp;l=zijzen-7), FastAPI json serialization speed is 50% of starlette(which FastAPI is based on). In the test, your framework uses ujson that is supposedly faster than python built-in json used by starlette. Do you know what causes the difference?
Another day, another updated blog post! Minor update: bumped the dependencies, fixed a few typos, and fixed a bug in the code Post description: This post shows how to integrate Celery into the Python-based Falcon web framework.
This project needs to use https. Is it possible to execute rsync over https?
Yes, I can hack a dirty solution which does work. But I like standards. I don't want to re-invent something that is already covered by the http (or other) spec.
&gt;Voila, you become 1/2 a hacker. Is this r/masterhacker now? How on earth is any of what you said related to somebody getting into a productive part of network programming?

Pandoc?
I've worked up groups that use all the options, but I think it's safe to say that the largest companies aren't going to bother hosting their own. The cost savings to a large company means nothing. Azure DevOps is big in companies where everyone has an MSDN account. You get more functionality than the stuff like Jira and bitbucket with good integration into all other things you use in a Microsoft stack. Companies with ancient legacy stuff or sometimes using on premise TFS. Don't work at those companies 😅
As FastAPI adds code on top of Starlette, it should never be faster than Starlette, as it would spend at least the time it takes to execute the Starlette code (plus the FastAPI parts on top). But that extra code from FastAPI is there replacing what in many cases would be custom code you would write in your app. In realistic scenarios, you normally have to do authentication, data validation, serialization, etc. FastAPI does a lot of that for you, that's the main overhead. But it would probably be there too in your application, just that you would have to have written it. A bit more on how to think about these very broad benchmarks: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/benchmarks/
It's not safe to say this. I work closely with several big companies and we all host our own. It is stupidly cheap and why would you give a third party your code and IP.
Are you sure your code works? I'm getting `s1 = line[i[1]+1:ii[0]]` `IndexError: list index out of range` on line 10. &amp;#x200B; Also, what if I want negative values? What if I want to change the hours or the minutes?
Nice project, but if i can be honest, I'm more interested in that DnD Text Adventure :) 
I'm not sure it's entirely true. The second part is but I think the prevalence of C# with employers means we tend to pick other languages for hobbies. It's pretty hard to measure by person rather than by language, but where all my hobby work tends to be Go and on GitHub, I write most my life in C# in Azure DevOps. I contribute to these statistics in a way that makes it look like less C# is being written, but something like the stack overflow survey is probably a lot more accurate overall. The co-worker I am closest to has more open source work in Java and typescript. Curious people tends to be the one writing open source projects, so I think a lot of us want to do something else outside of work. 😎
What resources did you use to learn how to build this? 
So... more nginx than apache? i tought was the other way arround
A recruiting agency I'm familiar with in my town hires 70% for Microsoft stack. It's an example of bias and the opposite direction since the average PHP shop isn't paying for recruiters, but it is a good indicator about how far sampling bias can skew something.
Nice! Now, if you want, you can learn about web sockets and make this into a web app. Just imagine what you could do then...
Awesome job! Big fan of Dash and how it allows python developers to create web apps without the need for a deep understanding of HTML/CSS/JS. Only suggestion would be to try and improve performance, load time is a bit slow. 
Started learning socket yesterday and saw this today, thank you very much sir!
Try getting a piece of paper and playing with different rectangles. 
What have you already done on this problem?
If you don't want to help the kid why not just hop off the post instead of replying to everyone that does want to help. "Technical ignorance" is caused by people like you who shit on coding newbys. Making newbys scared to ask the very basic questions first. Instead of your countless patronizing lectures consider saying something along they lines of: "Hey man, mind copying and pasting your code here so I can try to run it?" Seems that likely would have been more effective if your goal was to actually help. Asshole
get some graph paper and just draw a couple rectangles and don't label it on the grid as (1,2) (4,2) etc... label each point of the rectangles as x1, x2, y1, y2.... you'll start to see something and that kind of visual should help. if you don't have graph paper, plane paper with a ruler :P
Actually I am new to programming! So I am not looking for code!! I am just trying to built the mechanism how to think for any programming question! My algo would be 1. take the values 2. take the difference of the values 3. if the difference (-) then don't overlap 4. if (+) then do overlap I think i am wrong. just algorithmic help would be great
When you get some paper and pencil, draw the three cases. The two rectangles never touch. The two rectangles touch but don't overlap. The two rectangles intersect and overlap. Look at what comparisons you need to make (x and y values) to calculate area. 
Thanks stranger! We are on Oracle, so I imagine they have APIs to access. Were your users going to websites and entering data from the website and into a spreadsheet, hence the webscraper? Any online resources you recommend?
Why not just launch multiple jobs in parallel? Use subprocess to launch them all at once.
I'm happy to help. I'm not the most experienced but I like the challenge. You just need to make sure you know how it works. The math isn't hard it's just understanding how to set it up. Python is pretty straight forward but I'm not interested in doing your homework for you. In this case the function was pretty straight forward, even if the problem page you provided did not explain the decision step very well (You should check to make sure that part is correct) the only advanced piece I used was the named tuple which is part of the standard library. I could have defined the point as a object or just as a simple list. 
Assume the given coordinates will always produce an overlapping area where (x1,y1) represents the right, and (x2,y2) represents the left. Your solution can be as easy as `(x1-x2) * (y2-y1)`. I suspect there is more to this.
I don't know if this has any bearing at all, but may be useful anyway. Be careful when running tkinter in a threaded environment. All calls to tkinter should happen only in the program's main thread. &amp;#x200B;
Yeah i know it, but I would like to this without any external module.
Tinydb is a complete python db without need external module, only this library. The "db" la a simple json file or it can be a in-memory base 
It will be easier for you to reason about and modify the flow of your game if you break up your code into functions. For example, one function to build a new character, another to conduct a fight, another to update scoring, and another to check winning conditions. ``` char=makeChar() while True: doFight(char) updateScore(char) if winCondition(char): break ```
Yes. I wish it had a cleaner interface without dependencies. But good enough. Thanks!
Definitely a lot more than few lines of extra code. [https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart/blob/master/quart/datastructures.py](https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart/blob/master/quart/datastructures.py)
I greatly appreciate what you have done. Task two seems too be more straight forward as it's just a loop iteration.....which I still struggle with 
The problem can't be solved with the information given. 
How did you obtain training data for the generator?
\&gt; Because it runs in a single tab, you can make chrome open it as a chrome app, with no browser header. ...and where can I learn such magic...
I don't think it's a guarantee, but since JupyterLab is supposed to replace the traditional notebook interface, it looks like most extension authors are updating their stuff to move to the new system. &amp;#x200B; As someone else already said, I think they've adjusted the plugin backend to make it easier to work with (though this will inevitably break backwards compatibility with existing plugins probably).
Documentation says `conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab` to install it. Not sure if that's necessary though. 
No clue. I only work in normal python. 
Yes, it works. U have tried it on subtitle files for *bbc the musketeers*. Minutes, yes. Not hours. Negatice values. Em. I dont think so. It might need modification for that. 
I am not looking for an exact number!! Just an optimal solution woulf be fine!! Just a set of condition to check if its possible
how can I define a rectangle with one point?
Nice Java there. Why does it take hundreds of lines of code to convert a data class of known fields into a dictionary? 
It is just an assumption!! What matter is how can you check whether it will overlap with the other rectangle or not!
Working on an wrapper for a soap web service from a service provider. I'm using Sanic Framework and Python-Zeep.
i need a diagonal line to tell the size and location of a rectangle
https://i.imgur.com/y7UxbOi.jpg
You sure about that? James really seemed to have it coming.
Not required!! Just a set of comdition if its possible or not!
I tried it on an srt file I downloaded. I recommend you test it on other files if you have any. &amp;#x200B;
See the _Making the change permanent_ subheading at http://christopherroach.com/articles/jupyterlab-desktop-app/
Woulf woulf, you're just barking at the moon. Without knowing the size and orientation of the rectangles there is not enough information to solve the problem. 
I second this, Fluent Python is awesome. Just don't read it cover to cover, pick and choose what interests you.
need sizes and locations to tell whether they are overlapped
If you have the coordinates of one corner of rectangle A and you know it's height and width, you can work out the coordinates of the other 3 corners. Now do the same for rectangle B. Next, for each corner of rectangle A, see if it's in rectangle B - if any of them are, there's an overlap for you to work out; if not, there isn't. If there is it should be pretty easy to work out the area (unless either/both rectangle is NOT parallel with the axes, in which case it'll get a bit more complicated). &amp;#x200B; .. that should give you a good idea of what to do, without writing the code for you. Good luck!
This might be of some interest to you. Haven't used it, no idea how useful it is. [https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterlab-hub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterlab-hub)
Is this project on GitHub? Would really love to go through your code and get some learnings. 
Can you explain how to use GitHub? I know there are tons of tutorials on the net but I find I learn something new when asking a knowledgeable person directly... 
Is that sarcasm?
What's another great project for beginners?
lol true
In Python?
&gt; &gt; &gt;It’s all stuff I’ve learnt online How much online learning did you go through to reach your current coding level?
Yes
Before you start with GitHub are you familiar with git? That should be your starting point. Try learning from git scm https://git-scm.com/doc This will help you a lot. Once you understand basics of git, GitHub should be very straight forward.
No, I'm not. Thanks for simplifying it for me. I'll start with your link.
rsync uses ssh. I've remembered that Django and Flask have support for chunk uploading, you can look into that. 
I’m working on a very similar project: Sharing files (images) and variables (HUGE 1-D NumPy arrays) remotely between two PCs, do some processing on them (run an object detection and recognition model on the 1D array) and send the result back. Python Sockets is so bloody fun. Great job, by the way, mate.
Good work, i'm a begginer and i'd like to ask for the name of the program that you are writing this, thanks for reply
That sounds like what I do at work, most days! Except I’m clicking around going, “Where the hell was that csv-json thing I wrote??”
The information you are providing to this function will only allow us to tell whether these two rectangles *can* overlap. We lack information required to infer any other reasonable properties.
always knew building chat systems was a gateway drug into blackhat chaos
Loops should be pretty simple as long as you remember that in a for loop you are looping over things, basically if you have a list numbers = [1,3,5,6,7,8] and you want to loop over it for number in numbers: each number inside the loop will be each element in the list. I used a list comprehension at the end of my prior example. But we can rewrite that as a loop to just print each bearing for point in points: #point will be an index to the dictionary if point &gt; 1: print(compute_bearing(points[1], points[point]) #points in the dictionary, point in the index of the dictionary, we are always using 1 as the original point 
Ok, I sort of understand. Thank you for your help
I think for deployment to production, tensorflow is still the state of the art. I don't see a huge difference in terms of framework flexibility. You can use Keras for a high level implementation instead of scikit NN. 
What are you using to pack it into an .exe?
Fair enough, I'll probably work off the base image that fastapi uses then and use ADD ./requirements.txt /requirements.txt pip install -r /requirements.txt
Yep, good idea. Do that before copying your application code, that way you take advantage of Docker build caching.

Isn't the point of graduate work that *you* have the idea?
I made a few changes. I intend to improve the implementation as well.
Very cool. Have you put this on HackerNews yet? I am sure they'd love this.
You can use PyInstaller, it's quite good.
Nice clean code, well done. Here's a bug for you: An admin could potentially kick the wrong client if someone leaves the chat at the wrong time: after the admin has received the list of people to kick and before the admin has entered the number of the person to kick.

&gt; Isn't the point of graduate work that you have the idea? Yeah it is. And I had 2 ideas about what can i do but my mentor said that it cannot be done. The main reason of failiure was that my ideas could be done but 1) first app exists in industry and making the same was nonesense 2) making scripts as 'art for art' .So why I am asking ? Well, after this two failiures perhaps somebody can throw some idea, and then maybe I will can build something with this topic. I don't have so much experience and for me inspiration comes with real problems. My ideas were wrong from the point of view of graduate work itself. And I am looking still for inspiration.

Can be `filter(None, trades)` if you prefer
You reinvented a modem from 1960?
You can use [filter](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_filter.asp) and lambda to make it more interesting.
[Seems](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3013449/list-comprehension-vs-lambda-filter) like filters are slower. (Why “None”?)

[Seems](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3013449/list-comprehension-vs-lambda-filter) like filters are slower.
Thanks! Yeah, for some reason I'm not "popular" there, I posted it at the same time as here, but it seems only my mom (exactly 1 person) saw it 😂 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19389307
https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#filter &gt; If function is None, the identity function is assumed, that is, all elements of iterable that are false are removed.
Besides, not sure if trades = filter(lamba trade: some\_filter\_on\_trade, trades) looks any better. At least here I know where to look for the filter condition 🙂
Shouldn't be slower with `None` instead of a `lambda`.
Hm, but that’s not my intention. There’s a certain condition based on which I want to filter it. To make it even weirder, what I *really* want is filter out, i.e. drop, some elements. But seems like that’s the most efficient way to do this in Python. Lodashpython, anyone? 
Unless you're really pressed for performance or have an incredibly large dataset (in which case, use C extension, not python) the difference is minimal. Clarity is key in python, if you wanted speed you'd be using C.
Oh you typed more stuff off-screen, never mind then :)
Oh you typed more stuff off-screen, never mind then :)
Didn’t want to reveal all secrets at once 😁
I’m indeed using numpy in a more performance-sensitive part of the code. But the thing is, filter does not make it look any better, and — the main reason of course — makes the tongue-twister analogy not as obvious.
Yeah, wish it were that easy 😁
Hehe, no, here sound waves are the only medium, not just a small step before/after a cable, no cables between devices required :) Technically it's still a modem, yes, but you get the point, in practice this far simpler.
I was under the same impression as the other person that you only wanted to have a simple filter. As per my edit, you could try using 1-letter variables in the list comprehension, with the same justification that you can have single character variables for \`for\` loop counters.
Try to find someone who is in charge in your company and let him/she review it and get the result on paper. 
Sweet
Perhaps I should. I come from a self-defined “school of self-explanatory variable names”, but I already noticed that it’s not that popular in python with all the pd, np, and similar contractions.

The company I work for nobody works together if I ask I'll prolly never hear from anyone again lol
at the very least, awesomely beautiful visuals!
Working on some sample plots with flask as backend and vue/plotly.js on the front.
well the thing is, the `[expr for iv in iter if cond]` syntax already explains the intentions of the `trade` variable well enough. If you were to go nested expressions (`[expr for iv_iter in iter for iv in iv_iter if cond]`) you'd still want to use the full variable.
soul thing. Heh.
Haha?
I hope you implement this with some threading. That will give you the chance to do trade for trade in thread if... which is already more than a quarter of the way to "as I was going to St. Ives, I met a man with seven wives". 
&gt; first app exists in industry and making the same was nonsense A possible (but not guaranteed) solution would be, if it was paid, and no good open source alternatives exist (not just free, big difference), then you could possibly reimplement it as open source, or contribute a rewrite to the "bad" existing open source clones. Dunno if that makes it "good enough" for a grad project, but it would certainly get the companies off their bums if your project takes off so it certainly has worth in my opinion. Alternatively, make a plugin that automates something repetitive in the app, or provide it as a feature if there's already something open source. I don't have much experience so I'm not saying this out of any authority, but this is the most common theme of projects in my senior project class other than video games so it may help you.
😆
filter is slower if you're giving it a complex expression (because Python's function calls are not cheap). If you already have a function or are sorting on "self-booleanness" (which is what `None` does) it's likely going to be faster. On my machine, given an input `s` of 100 random booleans `[i for i in s if i]` takes 6µs while `list(filter(None, s))` (filter is lazy so it wouldn't be equivalent without it) takes 3µs (assuming cpython, in pypy the listcomp is always faster though the difference is small).
Discord Bot that keeps up with raffles from different raffle subreddits like kniferaffles. I was tired of looking for a way to get notified of new raffles.

Instead of if len(trades) &gt; 0: do_things try: if len(trades) == 0: continue do_things
Self-explanatory names are great for symbols with a scope of more than a few lines. But they can hurt clarity and readability if everything has a longer name than neccessary.
"Python Shell" generally refers to the IDLE window, and this won't work there. Also you should watch [this famous talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0).
No problem! Yes that's correct, we were a small company that didn't even have a proper IT department, so we'd go through small third-party companies for things like expense reporting and credit card processing that used web-based interfaces to interact with their databases, hence the webscrapers. I sent you a message, check your inbox.
There’s actually just this one line within the if block, the rest follows within the while block. 
This is really cool! Excited to see where they take this.

Why do people always comment about what they think should be a better code in every post just meant for humor?
it's just \`if trades:\` or \`if not trades:\`

When I first started learning Java I would end up with tons of extra end-brackets. Luckily it seems like most the Python IDE's let you type over the auto-corrected endings.... but still annoying. 
100% agree. Learning to code makes me want to create better languages or IDEs, but I know that's way too much work. 
Found this to be true for most using Python, thanks!
Ha! There are so many posts everyday it can easily be drown in them. I think it can draw more people in if it has a more click-baity and detailed title. Right now the title seems a bit too generic. I am not a native English speaker, but from what I read in the doc and the replies you made in this post, I come up with this: A type-first Python web framework with Go-like performance and automatic data validation, serialization, documentation, and OpenAPI and JSON Schema support It's 2 times longer than most posts but I think it already catches eyeballs with `type-first` and `Go-like performance` so people will be likely to continue reading and be pleasantly surprised with its features. You can then make a comment elaborating on the features. People are more comfortable to click into the comment section than the post link. When there is already 1 comment(even though it's you), they are more likely to click in and know more about it. It's just a suggestion. Don't feel pressured you need to do anything. I just hope more people can discover this gem! 
You should be, it looks good!
Never heard of Yapf, thanks for this. Any other tips? :D
damn lol
In my opinion a python shell is when you open your terminal and type 'python' to open the interactive interpreter. IDLE is garbage and doesn't even come with the default installation anymore (at least on new versions of Linux). &amp;#x200B; I agree with some points in that video, but I agree with this comment more: "This presentation is an attempt by someone who has a good point to overstretch that point way beyond reason". 
It’s super useful. I don’t know why it isn’t enabled by default. For new projects, we should say goodbye to C though and use [something that doesn’t segfault](https://www.benfrederickson.com/writing-python-extensions-in-rust-using-pyo3/).

That is the startup solution. The medium to large business solution is to pay 5-7 figures to a third party to do that and explain to IT department executives what that means . Now excuse me as I am busy writing a post about how government is inefficient and private companies are efficient 
lmao
What I said about the term "python shell" was not an opinion. AFAIK the only official place the term appears is in IDLE. As to your second point, your program could be reduced to this: from sys import platform from subprocess import call cmd = 'cls' if 'win' in platform else 'clear' def clear(): try: call(cmd, shell=True) except Exception as e: print(e) if __name__ == "__main__": clear() You don't think that's a lot neater and more readable? FWIW that try block needs to be circle filed too. Let it do it's just and raise an error. 
80 character line limit. We're in a big screen world now, 120 is a totally acceptable default.
Maximum line length of 79. Make it 160. 
Sounds good to me! I can change it. &amp;#x200B; I did make a module once (without a class) as you suggested btw... [ispalindrome()](https://github.com/rootVIII/random_recursion/blob/master/palindrome.py) For some reason I thought it more official to make a class hahaha. I agree with you though
FINALLY someone called out James. 
Which ide is this?
If I'm understanding the question, the answer is anywhere between 0 and (x2-x1)*(y2-y1). If the rectangles can be at any angle there isn't an upper bound, but maybe being top right requires it be farthest right and farthest up, which makes them level. 
What ide are you using ?
Building your first web API with Flask Scrape a news site for headlines Text based personal assistant (i.e. what's the weather? what time is it? How many subscribers does ___ have?)
Awesome thanks
Initializing a class always returns the class object, and the REPL always prints what is returned ... so outside of making a function (like I showed, or one that uses the class), the only way around it is to use it along with an assignment. &gt;&gt;&gt; _ = clear() 
FastAPI uses Pydantic and this library looks to promote wrong type hints practice right at its front page: This is the first example there: ``` class User(BaseModel): id: int name = 'John Doe' signup_ts: datetime = None friends: List[int] = [] ``` If one wants `signup_ts` to be either `datetime` or None, the right type hint to use there is `Optional[datetime]`. When I scrolled down, I facepalm'ed even more when I saw this: ``` class Model(BaseModel): simple_list: list = None list_of_ints: List[int] = None simple_tuple: tuple = None tuple_of_different_types: Tuple[int, float, str, bool] = None simple_dict: dict = None dict_str_float: Dict[str, float] = None simple_set: set = None set_bytes: Set[bytes] = None str_or_bytes: Union[str, bytes] = None none_or_str: Optional[str] = None compound: Dict[Union[str, bytes], List[Set[int]]] = None ```
It's not opinion, it's standard. Mostly, comments like that are meant to share knowledge and help.
Doesn't seem to be up yet. 
Cool, thank you for the ideas. I've been wanting to scrape websites and figure out how to script something so that I can analyze that data with Pandas. I want to essentially search for something, and have the scraper scrape like the first 500 sites, and store that into a spreadsheet. Any tips for this? I have tried Googling, but I get overwhelmed and then give up quickly.
Having tabs considered at all. 4 spaces and a text editor that can input 4 spaces when you press tab.
long lines reads better than using "\" at the end of line.
it is anachronistic*

a function it is! Thank you for the input!
I mean, you can generally avoid `\` line breaks, but I often feel like the tricks you have to use to do it hurt readability more than they help. 
This is amazing, im completely mindblown. Thank you so much for your work.
nice flair! 
Probably does multiple method lookups instead of one. Method lookup is unfortunately very slow in Python.
then what is point of if at all? You can do list comprehension on empty list.
What's the point of comments under such a joke if not? 
snake_case variables and function names. It's entirely personal but I just think camelCase looks better.
Thanks! I like it when people point it out. :)
Try with this: &gt; files – (optional) Dictionary of 'name': file-like-objects (or \{'name': file-tuple\}) for multipart encoding upload. file-tuple can be a 2-tuple ('filename', fileobj), 3-tuple ('filename', fileobj, 'content\_type') or a 4-tuple ('filename', fileobj, 'content\_type', custom\_headers), where 'content-type' is a string defining the content type of the given file and custom\_headers a dict-like object containing additional headers to add for the file.
i like this little guys `_` 
Readability counts you heathen!
“A tab takes up less memory than 4 spaces!” /s
Is this actually worth using? To be honest I find it more convenient to just prefix my commands with pipenv run rather than have to pay attention to which virtualenv is currently active.
Yes... pythons main problem is memory usage...
I'm with you here. Though I do prefer PascalCase myself.
You're not only wrong but even if you were right being a pedantic ass is of no value. Shell appears as a description to ipython, in the api to subprocess, has a general technical meaning that fits just fine here, and so on. 
Jupyter?!
&gt; You're not only wrong I am? How so? The api to subprocess is referring to the system shell, ie bash. Official python docs (as far as I can tell) never use the term "python shell" with the exception of IDLE. And I truly did not mean to be an ass. This sub is not an upvote party; people who post here expect some constructive criticism. 
Pycharm
I see you have found list comprehension . 
&gt;to share knowledge and help. &amp;#x200B;
Yes, I was agreeing 
Ah, the ol rhetorical question, eh? Sorry, friend, I'm a programmer. I only read literally :P
I completely understand ahah
Yes that'd make sense if someone was asking for help. Not when they were just joking about something. If they do that then the normal custom is to reply with another joke, not to show how much you know. Not to mention most people don't even know what the code is about, what is it doing, what are the data structure etc and they just see a line of code and say how it can be done differently. If you're really trying to be helpful, don't do a half-assed job.
VSCode most def
I'm sorry, is this a joke forum?
come for the shitposts stay for the karma
Aptana studio 
Not op. But that's definitely VSCode.
Learn some key concepts and build from that.. Django has a good community and a lot of resources on the internets.. good luck!
https://stevepython.wordpress.com/2019/03/06/python-code-snippets-12
The post is meant to be humorous, don't you understand humor? Also, speaking about jokes you do know where the name Python comes from, do you? 
Thanks mate, will work on that! 
Checking for list emptyness by truthyness is very much a style thing, and technically not the same operation. You may want to deal with `None` and `[]` differently, which `if trades` does not allow. Personally I don't like how truthyness is used in Python. Also inb4 "PEP8 says so". Its a good style guide, not the bible. 
Looks good! Now try to make a tkinter GUI ( it's really easy if it's just an entry and text displaying).
Yeah, the suggestions look like the from VS.

this post sounds like a great candidate for /r/programminghumor
Hmm I kinda like this, since it jives with the notion of “line of sight” in code. This is something we value highly over in the Go community.
Not at all! I'm genuinely interested, I've been considering making something of like that myself 
I find moments like these beautiful because it's easily understandable. Now there are variables without plural suffix s (e.g., data) that annoys me.
&gt;Can you give it a try? I just got home and was able to connect. 
Oh of course haha. But I do enjoy the concepts behind a lot of hacking tools. I’ve only tested in my own environment and would never run it on another machine. Have only tried it on a mates pc (asked if I could just to test connectivity over internet) and he was happy to help me test. While I went through his pc I had him standing behind me as a safeguard so haha xD
Built a script to play Piano tiles and managed to clear more than 600 tiles. Pretty happy with the result
This is off topic, but somebody is bound to say it, so I might as well first... data is already plural, the singular form is datum.
Thank you for pointing that out. Should be an easy fix though. Just research the list after picking a client and double checking to see if the clients name still exists. If so, kick. Else, throw an error to the server stating that they do not exist anymore: client has disconnected. Something like that. 
Yes, that's what I meant. Data is the plural form which unfortunately don't have the s. That was the first thing I was taught in my data science course 😂
Exactly what I use.
FYI OP, you can use len(trades) like a boolean which would be true if it's returning &gt; 0. \`\`\`if len(trades)\`\`\`
So the scripting language is Python3. I use SublimeText 3 to view and edit my scripts. And I use Windows command prompt to run my scripts from the folder they sit in. Command prompt is also printing all the text you see on screen. Feel free to download the source code and have a read through as it explains a lot on what this program is doing. Feel free to PM me and I can send some links to some beginner material. 
 Cheers :) That sounds awesome! An FTP/TFTP server is what I’ll look into next probably. I only discovered sockets about a week ago and I’ve fallen in love with them haha. 
Command prompt Or power shell (Joke if you can’t tell)
So I’ve been practicing python for about 3 years but recently it has been slow practice because of work commitments. The first year was basic systems that loop and print stuff to screen. Now I’m more confident in building Fuller programs that actually have meaning. In regards to sockets and threading though I’m still fairly new to this as I only discovered them like a week ago haha. 
It's possible to both appreciate the humor in a post and also share knowledge; it's not just for the OP, but for everyone else reading the thread who can benefit from this sort of "institutional knowledge" gained through threads exactly like this one
I know the possibilities are endless. I’ve only just scratched the surface with sockets haha. 
I looked online because when I first discovered sockets I was into making a program that backdoors into a client pc. (Eventually want to learn pen-testing) And from there I expanded on that and looked at the official socket and threading documentation itself and made this from my own knowledge. 
Cool animation :) don't forget to close that them thar file handle :)

Text adventures are great fun to build. I tend to make an awesome game system. Character creation Random monster generation that scales based on level Turn based fighting Different character abilities. Etc... But when it comes to actually making a story.... I’m terrible xD 
I'm impressed. I feel stuck after about 3 years of practice. I can write simple print programs, can loop random numbers, assign variables, play around with lists and dictionaries, and have tinkered with importing pandas, numpy, requests, and webbrowser, but I still feel like I'm not actually doing anything meaningful that you mentioned. Is there a bit of wisdom you can share with us as far as how you changed your beginning approach to a more advanced coding approach? Thank you in advance for anything you may have to say on this topic
I can totally relate to that 
Sure -- artificially :) But English is not Latin, and in the organic, natural English language, "data" is a mass noun in the exact same vein as "trash", "money", "blood", etc. For some reason, people have just decided to pick on "data" in particular, never applying the same silliness to other Latin loans like "trivia" (**never** "a trivium" or "many trivia") and "agenda" (**never** "an agendum" or "many agenda"). And, as far as data goes, they don't even pick on it *consistently!* Do you say "I don't see that many data"? Of course not -- the only thing people try to harp on is "this data" vs. "these data", but the word's underlying status as a mass noun is untouched, so grammatically it still takes "much" -- as in, "not that much data". I wish this nonsense didn't exist to be argued over
Find a problem and solve it.
Good work man. You giving me some motivation
Depends on the detail at which you interact with the object. Do you really need to load each individual round into a magazine when you can just have a bolter object with an ammo count and reload function?
Doesn't matter.
I think the way you wrote it looks better.
P(Python)PT: Empty lists evaluate to false, so you don't actually need to do `if len(trades) &gt; 0:`, you can just use: `if trades:`
Same here! Got any tips or learned anything handy?
You're definitely correct, however in this example he isn't filtering the list, so `if trades:` would probably be the clearer of the two. Especially considering he does what you mentioned directly afterwards.
I connected to it but the Server wasn't broadcasting the messages back. &amp;#x200B; Really cool that you have done this. Eventually I'd like to host it and get everyone to access it and have a bant haha.
I'm trying to emulate the Death Watch RPG as closely as I can and one of the aspects in that game was the ability to have different types of ammo. Things like High Velocity rounds, Hollow-point rounds, incendiary rounds, metal storm rounds, bio-toxin rounds, etc. But also different size magazines, things like 'Low profile' magazines that may have as few as 3 rounds in it, to high capacity drums that will carry 50 rounds. There were even options for back pack mounted belt feed ammo boxes that could carry 200 rounds. So my logic says that because there could be different types of ammo with different effects, I need to build a class for those types of ammo. Because there are different types of containers for the ammo, I need to have a class for those containers. 
not sure if that answers your question or not.
Curious you'd post that twice without seeming to actually read it. Numerous comments there say the difference should be negligible so it's interesting you're passing on filter but not using numpy arrays which are truly faster. One comparison with map vs list comprehension showed map was faster. Another showed filter was faster, but with an incorrect comparison, and another showed list comprehension was faster. If you can run some benchmarks you can let that decide, but in general filter is the way to make what you were trying to do more readable which looked like the basic point of the post.
Even just looking at a current application and trying to mimic it can help. I wanted to make an app that kind of simulates a bank app for a user. They can view their accounts, access their money, withdraw/send, etc... And I did. I feel if you make a program that you are interested in, you'll definitely push that program to see what it can do. And you'll learn new things, think of new ideas with the things you've learnt and in turn, make more meaningful programs. Just starts with an idea, then see what you can do with that idea. Problem solving is key though cause running into compilation errors or program breaking bugs are a treat ;)
Yeah, if you're going for a system with great amounts of detail then you'll find using objects much easier than other methods. Just make sure you consider other methods before dedicating large amounts of time to developing lots of objects
any particular points or warning signs you can think of that i should be on the look out for?
&gt;Find a problem and solve it. So what kind of podcatching problem were you trying to solve?
Thank you very much
I am surprised the votes for line length are not higher. I knew it would be the #1 but I thought there would be a larger margin.
This was so helpful. Thank you!
Learned a lot! How to read through an excel file (the python module xlrd helps a lot) and execute code for each line, how to parse values to extract the info I need. Logging is also useful to get a report on what went well and what went wrong. I'm doing API calls to update data in a webpage, so if the API rejects it, I want to know why. As for tips, I'm not nearly experienced enough to provide tips, but making liberal use of the print function is extremely useful. A variable can get modified when you don't expect it and it changes everything in your code, so more prints helps with that. I often have stuff like: print ("LOOK HERE" + x) This helps to see jf x changed :) 
Zork was not object oriented code (you can download the code). Maybe you don't need classes at all?
well it rhymed, at least...

Starting to learn coding right now, but for the time being I am working on Project Euler. My goal is to get as many of these done as I can to see where I can go before I enter college and maybe find a program to calculate percentages for grades. I just got to question 9 on project Euler
So since I'm not actually trying to make a game exactly, I'm just going about it in the entirely wrong way?
Sorry, just saw this. I'm connected but don't see anyone else on. 
ThisVariableHasAVeryLargeAmountOfClarity
I'm sorry, but I don't have any advice. I have the exact same error and don't have any idea. I installed PyCharm because it was recommended by our university but literally nothing works. Other IDE's work fine for me. Did you find a solution yet?
You can put Optional around all that. But you are not enforced to. Pydantic doesn't force you to write the more verbose "utterly correct" version, but when that is a concern, you can of course do it. It is noted in the documentation, referencing mypy: https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/#usage-with-mypy
I don't know what "line of sight" means. I like it because it reduces nesting, both visual and mental.
I’m not sure this can be answered on reddit. It’s a long and complicated road. I don’t think a lot of people go straight into ML. I think they start somewhere in analytics before hand and work up to it. Seems like most of the ML jobs out there are fairly rare, usually require a Masters, PhD, or years of experience in industry. Additionally, solid knowledge of upper level maths like multivariate Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Statistics. 
Me: coding is so elegant it borders on poetry. Also me: [sample for sample in samples if is_sample(sample)]
I think would be a ok choice for for representing ammo types. You could hold some information about what makes the classes different like damage or a function to handle status effects like fire or a move speed debuff. With objects you can also implement what are called magic methods that make the object useful in ways. If you create the __str__ method you can print the name of the ammo easier. The other option is to use a enum which is like a list of unique types of things and you could learn more about it [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html).
Thank you! That's great to hear. Thanks for putting the time to write it, you made me smile 😁
When I'm not planning my projects - allocating time tends to be an issue. If my project fails it's usually because I focus on one particular part of it too much. If you've spent three hours on something like the ability to colour your eyebrow with a gradient but you've spent ten hours on the game overall you're doing something wrong; if it feels like you're overdoing it, you probably are there's either an easier solution or the feature should be given low priority. Skip it until you have a functional prototype
changes pushed! I didn't use your one-liner because I didn't want to take credit for it. But thanks for the help. Also the clear\_screen object is gone like you said... thanks for that too.
`[item for item in iterable]` or `[element for element in iterable]` tend to be my choices in those scenarios. Just don't use item when using items(). :P
No need for the len() call, assuming it's a list or a dict or etc. just simply `if trades:` will get you there. In my head, I would read this as "if there are trades".
Congratulations!! How did you get to the point?
I think most python programmers (except those from a functional or LISP background) would prefer to see a comprehension over a filter() or map() or reduce() call almost every time.

If you know trades are a list, you don't need the `if len` check at all. You can just put `trades = [t for t in trades if ...]` and it'll just still be empty if it was already empty.
But why would you have something in samples if it isn't a sample?
Nice clean code. Will try to run it when I’m free. 
Great point.
I’ve been playing with it on an ESP32 with an I2C temperature and humidity sensor. It’s awesome and so simple to program.

I don't understand why functools doesnt have an identity function
if you're still on 2.7 then you have bigger issues than worrying about what is or isn't in 3.7 :)
Because it's a positive or negative control used for QC. 
&gt; Maximum line length of 79. Make it 160. Good luck with your first merge.
this x100!! I see it in professional code all the time, people thinking they need to express clarity via a variable name when the scope is only a few lines and the surrounding context gives the clarity, not the name of the variable. this is mostly true for people who worked on code bases where they needed to do that because methods would be hundreds of lines. (hello java)
&gt; In Python, single-quoted strings and double-quoted strings are the same. This PEP does not make a recommendation for this. Pick a rule and stick to it. When a string contains single or double quote characters, however, use the other one to avoid backslashes in the string. It improves readability. Use single quotes except when it's necessary to use double quotes. Also probably change the standard docstring format from """ to ''' as a result. And fix Black.
Damn man, you're light years ahead of me. Your analytical breakdown just got my wheels spinning in an entirely new direction. The idea of running a program and having it email me a report just sent my brain into a new galaxy. Very very helpful, thanks! &amp;#x200B;
The lambda is unnecessary in that example, just pass in the function directly 
Those contractions are more from the science community and certainly aren't preferred in python in my experience, although I will use those particular ones. If you must rename imports try and create a consistent vocabulary for the module. Btw don't guard a list comprehension against an empty iterator. If there are no elements it's just empty. Ask forgiveness not permission
In that case instead of using `None` you would want to use a lambda function accepting a single element of your list and evaluating to the value of your condition. E.g.: filter(lambda t: t[cond], trades)
Cool intro to SVR in python, but this is a terrible machine learning model. Definitely not making any money off of this. 
Genuine question : How do I learn these complex syntaxes? In the above example, the output from a loop and an if statement being stored into a list and so on. How do I learn this ? 
&gt; And you should avoid reusing variables too, makes it more difficult to reason about what the type/contents of a variable are. This jumped out at me too and just to spell this out a little more clearly, I think in this context what /u/_texonidas_ is saying is to call your new variable `filtered_trades` (for example) instead of reusing your original `trades` variable.
Ha ha ha, oh man you're funny. You've got the gall to attack me for being supposedly rude and hostile, while being twenty times more rude and hostile yourself. Hypocrite.

Bad naming then. 
Appending to a list in a loop is slightly faster than list comprehensions 
Oh lord this comment made me laugh out loud. Thanks for that. 
There are two kinds of code, pep8 and wrong
You have much better vision than I do.
Seaborne is also just mstplotlib. Most people don’t know it. That’s a disadvantage at a company.
Yeah, in a big code base that has evolved over time, quirks like this sometimes happen
Just for beginners of machine learning 😂
You’re using Python. You chose against speed.

Our Python Bible commands thou shalt not use camel case for variables [PEP8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) &gt; Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.
good point.
some of us are rebels. 
42!
 Ruby style trades = trades.map(:to_f).select {|t| t &gt; 10.2}.sort
Can simplify to: if trades: do stuff Also, naming is hard but important.
pascal style
Not a problem in the modern age where you can just download RAM.
That's probably because instead of taking the five seconds to fix it. You took longer write that comment.
Ignore the down voting. One element to be secure is to know how the hackers do it and how they think. Just don't actually use it on your client or you deserve the down votes
Bahaha, aren't you fun
I think this is probably true in most cases, but sometimes there's a gain in not evaluating all your imports if you don't need them. You can obviously do this more cleanly with separate files and __init__, but you can't always reorganize the project like that. 
Django has one of the best documentations for their framework as well as a very good tutorial that will show you all the components you need to make your own web app.
I just started learning python. I learned a bit of PHP last year so programming isn't totally foreign to me but I would like to take things to the next level. I need help looking for a project to base my own on. What I would like to do is make a python app that searches for articles on specific websites i.e. psychology today, psychology, medium, etc, for self-help and mental health articles. Anyone know of an app that does something similar or have an idea of something else I could create?
I’m brand new! I’m an Orchestral conductor looking to build a new side career path I computer programming. I’ve been working my way through Learn Python The Hard Way and I absolutely love it. I’ve been building a choose your own adventure style command line game to practice the basics. It’s the first piece of code that I’ve built from the ground up myself and it has been a blast! 
I remember commenting on your previous post asking for help (unfortunately it got deleted). It's great to see you have your code working :)
How do people code with those seizure inducing dialogs popping up after every other letter?
Weird. I can take a look tomorrow morning. 
One thing missing from the readme is why? What’s the goal? Was this just fun or is there an intended use?
Hi, I figured it out. I need to remove the fonts in my own Style as it conflicts with Font-Awesome. Kind of stupid... But I do wish that I could use two labels for one tab...
One letter variables are pretty much never clearer. The ONLY time they are clear is in a CS class and i is the index in a for loop and even then it should idx or index. 
As mentioned above, "shell" has a more generic meaning and there is the interactive ipython shell, there is also the interactive shell at [python.org](https://www.python.org/shell/), a simple reveals ample usage such as this one: "The prompt **&gt;&gt;&gt;** on the last line indicates that you are now in an interactive Python interpeter session, also called the “Python shell”. " &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
I’m not sure I’d call this data science or machine learning
Yeah i think you are right
Stevenjd is fag
Doesn't the same pep also say you don't have to use an 80char line limit?
And why is there a `while` inside a `while`? And the `f = openfile()` doesn't appeal to me unless you're going to leave the file open for a long time and can't find a structured way of determining when it should be closed. And the: trades = [trade for trade in trades if trade] can be replaced with: trade = [x for x in trades if x] or: trade = list(filter(None, trades)) I personally dislike the `if x` test anyways... `if x is None` is better.
The code was fine, the text file was saved as RTF. I pm'd him and we figured it out without all the public berating 
really? you're gonna argue that this : trades = [trade for trade in trades if trade[cond]] Is clearer than this : trades = [t for t in trades if t[cond]] 
Sort of. It's still the default in a lot of places though. 
Lookup [list comprehension](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/list-comprehensions-in-python). 
It's especially great if you have a lot of conditions in your loop, makes the code so much clearer. 
That's very broad and every website is different. In terms of analyzing data with Pandas, don't worry about that until you have data. To focus the project I would say search for this 'something' on one website and scrape the results (like reddit for example). This is because every website has a different way of organizing their HTML so there's no one general way of scraping a website. By searching on only Reddit (again just for an example) you know what to expect from the result, whereas Googling a term and trying to scrape Hacker News and Twitter with the same code would be difficult. If you could be a little more specific I'd be happy to help!
poor choices of variable name?

Just today I finished up a little project I started earlier this week!! It converts pictures into spreadsheets at a 1:1 pixel to cell ratio. It is VERY slow but I was determined to finish by the end of the day so I skimped out on some of the streamlining. But it's the first full, complete, REAL thing I've made that wasn't for work, and it's fun!! I'm very proud of myself =) 
Xlrd was great to me, but I've had a LOT more luck with openpyxl. But I'm frequently hopping between python 3 and 2 so Xlrd might be better for strictly 3
And that was my point: no cable needed here, this is meant to be used without any phone in the middle. Designed for short range, insecure, but cero config required, etc.
It's just what it says: a tool for short range, zero config data transmission.
Well that’s exactly what it means haha googling “code line of sight” gives me a few articles about it if you want to learn more

I'm assuming in something like Haskell id is free (compiled away) but in python you'd incur the function call cost, making it undesirable. Just a stab in the dark
Well there are many modules which i like and love to work on . As per my requirements i use different modules which suits the best for my projects. I usually use Numpy, SciPY , Pandas. But my favorite is Pandas because it is very user friendly and contain almost all the requirements during a project. After the introduction of Pandas modules Python is getting more attention in the world. It is only because of Pandas module why Python is been used in the [Course of Data Science](http://pythonandmltrainingcourses.com/courses/best-data-science-training-in-delhi/).

That’s a great question actually. Somebody else already answered, so I’ll just go and say that yes, I spend a ridiculous amount of time googling while learning python. For any given goal, there seems to be at list three ways to do it, and, unlike say in js, no one can agree on which one is better. Any python question on StackOverflow has a couple of contradicting but equally upvoted answers 😬
Yeah, that’s a long story. Trades used to be a dataframe so I had to do this check. Then I found out that dataframes are ridiculously slow at being appended (that’s what I need to do elsewhere with the list), so I switched to vanilla lists, while never giving a second thought that the check is no longer required. Thanks for pointing that out!
Yes, that’s the (kind of) consensus I googled out, so that’s another reason I opted for it. I say “kind of” because it seems consensus is something totally alien to the python community 😁 (I might be wrong — just started getting deeper into the language.)
🤣 Better than the post!
I won’t! 😁
Bro VScode is not an IDE. &amp;#x200B;
its a text editor-VScode, not ide.
I know! And they are so buggy for python! Say there’s variable i. I type i and press Enter to go to the next line, and guess what? It inserts some totally unrelated stuff starting with an i! Need to turn it off...
Good to know I’m not the only one finding it strange! Re. guarding, https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b1h8za/coding_in_python_sometimes_feels_like_writing_a/eincdkq/
Indeed
Yeah, exactly the same as me. It was a side task for me and I had decided to postpone it for the time being. But after reading some dicuments, I absolutely fell in love with it. And your project made me even more excited about it.
Oh man. They hit you harder than they did me... After waking up this morning (I’m in Europe) I already found out that I might be the shittiest python programmer in the world. Not that I ever claimed to be good at it 😁 That’s python meta-humor, or maybe meta-sarcasm, if you think of it.

I’ll need tensorflow at some point, so I guess no workaround about that. I’m too old to start studying something new. (Or just lazy.)
Man. Isn’t that ridiculous? 
Yeah, [here’s](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b1h8za/coding_in_python_sometimes_feels_like_writing_a/eincdkq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) the story. 
It’s not just “if trade”, there’s code in that line off screen. 
Don’t really think it’ll make it more readable. But you have a point about my posting without reading to the end. I just take the most upvoted answer and go from there. Re. numpy arrays, is actually a list of dictionaries not just values, so seems like I’d need a dataframe, which is (surprisingly!) slow at being appended. 
I mostly think about myself. I know that I’m so stupid that if I see my code a month later I won’t be able to get the sense from just the context. So explanatory variable names are a necessity for me. 
That's a problem in any language that doesn't use semicolons or some other line delimiter. I use code completion in Emacs too, but it only gets activated when I press tab. It's still annoying sometimes, but way better than auto-complete.
There should be a similar option in vscode, I’ll google for it, thanks!
haha, no worries... yeah, not like the check hurts in any case.
I prefer “heretic”
Indeed. Even if for the confused me who will be reading this code in a month. It gives some clue as to the underlying logic of the code. 
Ha, naive difference between a chat client and a reverse shell is the latter passes the chat message into `os.system(...)`
Yeah
Ide??
Probably it. Converting Python None to NULL then running it at the C level in some if condition would be significantly faster than either a Python function being executed or a built in function being executed.
holy shit, this is surprisingly clean and well documented... That's impressive on its own. one thing though, the format you have like: ## This is called after every message has been received by a client. ## It will send a message to all clients in the CLIENTS dictionary ## And format the broadcast with the clients name followed by the message. def broadcast(message, prefix=''): try: for user in CLIENTS: user.send("{}{}".format(prefix, message).encode()) except: pass You might rather do the more usual blockquote under the def as function docstrings normally look, like def foo(): ''' This function foos itself. ''' foo() print('foo docstring: {}'.format(foo.__doc__)) That way tools like sphinx can pick up your docstring and automatically build documentation. If you actually look at a functions `__doc__` attribute, you'll see the documented string that you put in block quotes that way. You can programmatically pull out documentation of functions which is really fun for tools that do stuff like autogen unit tests from docs or build documentation pages. But regardless that code is extremely well documented and there's no problem trying to see why you did what you did. This is good stuff.
Do you have a background as paranoid C programmer?
I think it's ok to reuse a variable if you're creating and modifying it a few times within a few lines. Otherwise you end up with throwaway intermediate variables that live for one line 
Thanks for your comment. I appreciated that. You are right and this is a target for our team in next step. 
I think it's better to use the length-greater-than-zero version as it's more explicit. I don't like having to remember the arbitrary bool-casting behavior of different types.
So what? He wanted to ask what program is in the video but typed IDE thinking that it probably is one, I am not gonna not say VSCode just because it isn't an IDE? I am correctly answering his question. But you seem to be more interested in a debate or maybe want to get into r/iamverysmart VSCode not being an IDE doesn't mean that the program OP is using is not VSCode
I would put in big bold “this is just a guideline for core python devs, not a religion seriously.”
Yes. Check this out as well: ``` def func(data=[]): data.append(1) return data print(func()) print(func()) print(func()) ``` As you can see, the list changes each time because it’s mutable, just like your set. 
Use this a leaning tool only. Don’t bet the farm on any predictions...ever.
I like list comprehensions , but I’ve interviewed at google and they told me not to use any during the test also slices where prohibited too 
This is not a Python solution, but you may find this this discussion the Microsoft Community of use. [https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/need-to-batch-convert-word-to-pdf-files/4ee388d3-038f-4c46-a67c-9aacdbdfc2a0](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/need-to-batch-convert-word-to-pdf-files/4ee388d3-038f-4c46-a67c-9aacdbdfc2a0) This Word macro may be faster than your current solution. You will have to create a benchmark and compare the results. Have you done any analysis to work out what is slowing things down? Look at Windows Task Maanger and Windows Performance Monitor - https://www.digitalcitizen.life/basics-about-working-performance-monitor I would **guess** that the main source of delays in your current solution is the repeated creations of sub-processes. It is likely that the process will become faster if you use a long running process. IF that works you could look at creating a pool of long running processes, but that may end up being I/O bound. I think it would be better to start with the Word macro and see if that speeds things up enough for you. All of this could be a waste of time if it turns out the delay is due to something else (e.g. CPU bound I/O bound ...). Here are some links that may be of use. * https://michalzalecki.com/converting-docx-to-pdf-using-python/ * https://pdf.iskysoft.com/create-pdf/how-to-batch-convert-word-to-pdf.html I didn't know any of this, I just a quick web search and some thinking. 
I'd argue that python has the most consistent bool-casting. Empty version of any simple data type is false. a = {} // false object b = [] // false array c = '' // false string d = 0 // false int 
You still incur the cost when you write lambda x: x all the time. It's not just in this case I'd like an identity function. 
Does [Tus.io](https://tus.io) suit your needs? I’ve never used it, but it looks interesting. Seems there are Python libs available.

I learn Django few month ago and I recommend you but I don't know nothing about the other. The thing in Django is that is really easy to put your project logic on your view and this is a bad practice that you should avoid
Try each of them out for a single day and keep doing what you preferred. There is no perfect answer here. 
Django has a lot of functionalities built in, and a lot of third part module. You can use with sql or nosql databases, use with REST or GraphQL. Yes, you can do it also with flask but you need more confidence with python. Both of them are (maybe) OK for your project. If you are scared about complexity of Django, follow DjangoGirls. You can find online tutorial of workshop. A simple way to learn by doing. You'll use models, admin and template engine. After this tutorial, you can make a right decision, if you don't really need functionalities of django, you'll use flask. Django has a built in ORM. Anyway, look at APIstar, simplest way to create entrypoint, and do easy-custom-projects. If you need to manipulate lights with Raspberry, maybe you don't need django, but APIstar is enough for you. Let me know about your choice ;) 
I did that, I learned a little of both. Still thinking about which one to choose. 
Ok, thank you. I think I have a decent knowledge in Python so Im thinking about choosing Django... Because it has website admin page/solution built in. Also as I understand it has built in stuff for user authentication. Thats like the scariest part for me for now. I just like Flask simplicity... at least when you build a small things... I think it will be much different experience when I will start building authentication, database interactions and etc. So maybe in the long term Django will be overall easier on my project.
Huh, it isn't?
Yes, the first one is the way to do it (well, nearly, "if visited is None" is more Pythonic than == None) &amp;#x200B; I sometimes ask a question on this when I'm interviewing for Python developers, it's a good gotcha to know.
Reminds me if the many 'thing={thing}'.format(thing=thing) type lines I wrote in my life
Aside from what /u/_texonidas_ said, the python community frowns upon that because in python empty==false by design, and with the explicit objective of not having to write those comparisons by hand, so those kinds of checks are redundant and considered un-pythonic. Like writing Java code that checks if an object is of type X when the variable referencing it is already defined as of type X. Simply redundant, the language already does that check for you, by design. Also, it isn't casting, but that's just a detail :p
An open source audio mixer that will hopefully be usable for basic live sound reinforcement on a raspberry pi(Or at least a laptop). The idea is that it takes all the USB soundcards, adds them to JACK with alsa_in/out, but it gives them a name based on the hash of their USB path, which is used to pick random words from a list. So a card in the same port will always have the same JACK ports, something like USB-housepiewarp014. Next up is a web interface (Based on Kaithem of course, like half my stuff is) that lets you mix from a tablet like you do with X-Air type mixers. Eventually I also plan to add a decent media player UI, so the whole thing can work as an all in one solution for making announcements and playing background music. Shouldnt be too hard, because JACK is doing all the actual routing and mixing, so the next step is going to be the JACK autoconnection engine. Since I don't have to exactly follow the physical mixer paradigm, I can use an "Everything is a channel strip" model. Want reverb? Add a channel with a reverb on it, then add a send to the other channels, which will auto-generate a level control and connection to where the send goes. 
If it doesn't have to be Python and you want something that has batteries included, you can try out Spring (with Java or Kotlin). Just a personal preference, but I prefer something more statically typed for bigger projects. You also might want to check out what framework has a support for a user-management/authentication solution of your choice (AWS IAM, Keycloak, ...) because is seems your app will heavily rely on it.
It might be as easy as just reversing the quotes in this function: https://github.com/ambv/black/blob/master/black.py#L2601 ... but I doubt it.

Why dont you google this?
We can't really help you without seeing your code. But adding entry to dict is simple: your_dict['key'] = value Btw r/learnpython would be more suitable for you
My system is a little different. I use single quotes for internal program strings, and double quotes for text that needs to be printed or operated on. Of course, technically it doesn't matter, but it gives me some clarity when I read the code. d['key'] = "Hello"

You basically install everything in the project folder, so it's not installed on your system. When you're done, you just delete the whole thing. I use virtual envs in our production environment, also to keep things clean. It also helps with things you install with a package manager and with pip. Those things can collide and mess up your system. 
This is terrible advice. 
The file explorer after dark theme is like a white out explosion every time
Why? All he's going to be doing as a beginner is basic sdlib stuff there's no need for a virtual environment

This is the answer im interested in... I'm also learning Java litle by litle because at work we use a lot of things built with Java. Im not a developer, but I would like to have a better understanding of Java ecosystem. So was thinking to try to build website with Java in order to learn more. Tried to do the research about web development with Java. It looked really complex compared to Flask or Django. So it would take me even more time to understand enough. Also with Java it looks more complicated to publish your website.
When you’ve written a Python module, typically you would use a name/main block to test the functions within your module. ‘__name__’ only yields ‘__main__’ if you’re running the code directly from the module, as opposed to importing externally. So you can put local test code into the file that won’t execute when you import the module.

The reason pip is available on PyPI is that it has its own release cycle, separate from CPython or other Python implementations, so they can issue a new version and all you need is to `pip install --upgrade pip`, and you'll be set. Also, if you're running CPython on an OS with no pip, you can actually install a version of pip that's bundled with CPython using `python -m ensurepip` (unless your distribution removes it).
Let's not get into the debate, it doesn't matter.

Err why not just use Jupyter? Maybe I missed something as I’m on my iPhone right now but any project that relies upon JavaScript as much as this project apparently does, is broken in my mind.

Depending on what you currently have, there is a ton of ways you could do that. I would suggest that the door has some method open() that takes the player inventory as an argument and, if the player has a key, then unlocks the door. But this solution could not work depending on you actual code
My guess is you have the file name the same as the name of the function? Try renaming it 
Use raw\_input instead of input if you are using Python2.

Read the rules man. You're gonna want a list or dictionary of items the player has picked up and the door will check to see if the player has the key in their inventory. \`\`\` inventory = \[\] if input("Pick up key? ").lower() == "yes": inventory.append("key") \`\`\` ... \`\`\` if input("Open door? ").lower() == "yes": if "key" in inventory: print("You go through a door and see a beautiful haven, it is r/learnpython") else: print("The door is locked, and you don't have a key") \`\`\`
With Guido sort-of retired, any mention of Dutch people. ☺
This. In Python3's equivalent of Python2's `input()` is `eval(input())`, and Python3's equivalent of `raw_input()` is `input()`. See [this link](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_input.php) for more info on input from keyboard.
This looks really cool. Gonna give it a spin.
It takes my input but the input i enter it says "ahmad(the input) is undefined."
Using [https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv](https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv) for years now, and if you jump a lot between different projects (using auto-cd of course ☺), it just avoids lots of headaches 'cause you forgot to change into the right runtime.
Just entered raw_input and now it takes my input, Thanks for the help.
you are very welcome

"People who quite literally think their way is best every time" are not very good programmers. I've been programming for past 10-15 years and have come in contact with some of the best programmers in the business. I have also met in various conferences some python greats like David Beazley, Raymond Hettinger etc. They are the antithesis of the programmers seen here. Firstly great programmers get humor pretty well and don't need to show off how much they know about things, it becomes pretty apparent when you talk to them. Also they not only don't think their way are the best they can go out of their way to tell more inexperienced developers like me to improve them and even ask if they know of anything that might work better. You need a open mind to be a good programmer. 
Idk _why_ but you could probably set a script to store links to the articles by scraping https://planetpython.org/titles_only.html daily
Any plans to integrate as a service through Azure/AWS/Google Cloud?
It is still worth to use them for one line and throw away after if you give them reasonable names, thus making your code easy to read and understand instead of doing it in one step expecting the reader to understand a comprehensive statement.
Yeah. Light background + night light just seems to work better with the rest of the OS.
Why single quotes? 
I'm not sure exactly what the problem is, but this is what I could do. Firstly, don't use `sum` as a variable name, it's already a [function](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_sum.asp). Secondly, you repeat your inputs, which is unnecessary. You only need to take the inputs once. Third, (I'm not sure about this, but it worked when I changed it), don't declare variables in the function parameters. &amp;#x200B; I had a go at changing some of your code and this seems to work: def evenodd(num1, num2): total = (num1+num2) print(f"The sum is {total}") if (num1+num2)%2 == 0: print("Your sum adds up to an even number!") else: print("Your sum adds up to an odd number!") evenodd(float(input("First number")), float(input("second number"))) &amp;#x200B;
Before I read the text of your question my answer was going to be "data science" and "machine learning". Python is just a tool, and not a very difficult one to learn. But understanding how machine learning systems work is still a rare and valuable skill. You said ML never really clicked, can you double down on it and get more ML skills under your belt? Maybe instead of a math-heavy course you can focus on a practical programming exercise, something like the book [Deep Learning Cookbook: Practical Recipes to Get Started Quickly ](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Cookbook-Practical-Recipes/dp/149199584X)? Also I hate to say something so shitty, but I'm sure you know your age works against you. At least in American tech startups. I'm the same age as you and 100% know it's bullshit, but it's also a real form of discrimination in hiring. I know it's possible to highlight your experience as an asset but I don't have much personal advice for that, sorry.

1. /r/learnpython 2. Look into `str.startswith`
1. /r/learnpython 2. `list.index`
Read it in as a string (hint: `getline`). Check if it start with `$`, if so remove. Convert to double, e.g. `stod`. 
Your variables need to be defined before you call them in the function. Why not make a second function that gets two number and then returns them and passes them into the main function. Then you can take the input statements out of you main function. Also want to make sure that you catch non digit inputs, as they will also throw an error in you code.
1. excuse my post in the wrong place. 2. thanks
r/learnpython please in the future; you may slice a string like value\[1:\], you may strip values from both sides by value.strip("$"), you may join only digits "".join(\[val for val in values if val in "0123456789.," \]), ...
I’ve never been so conscious of choosing a powerful processor on my next computer since learning Python
You'll want to look at [`lstrip`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=lstrip#str.lstrip). It removes a substring from the start (left) of a string. ie. ``` &gt;&gt;&gt; s = '$40' &gt;&gt;&gt; s.lstrip('$') '40' ```
This is my favorite thread. I’m the guy that can understand a language but doesn’t speak it. I don’t code but I hang out here to learn the lingo and be able to convey my ideas to my developer. This week I had 2 scrapers built for me. 1 used the ebaysdk API and the other scrapes with Requests and BeautifulSoup and Openpyxl. Probably more than that but I’m happy with how they turned out. Next week I’m gonna get them linked and hopefully get them to run daily without me having to manually start the program.

I get this error: print(f"The sum is {total}") ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax 
This is a great, concise demonstration of the gotcha being encountered here. To elaborate: a function’s parameters (including default values for kwargs) are evaluated only when the function is first defined. Because a mutable data type is changed in-place when updated, when you use a mutable type as a default value, any changes to that original instance will effectively update the default value. This gotcha extends to values passed into the function as well. When a value of mutable type is passed into a function, any changes to that instance will take effect on the value from the calling code. For this reason, it’s a good idea to generate a copy of the value (using copy.deepcopy, for instance) and use the new copy for processing within the function in cases where mutable types are expected to be received. (I’m typing from my phone now, but I’ll try to remember to come back and update this with a code example).
I tried to use requests. But throttles the speed or something. It downloads extremely slow. I compare it to downloading the URL in chrome and its like 20 times faster. You're saying JS will be able to do this&gt; 
I tried requests.get() But it takes forever to download anything vs when i just use a web browser. Do they throttle the speed or something when using requests? I have about 1000 files to download each are about 200 mbs

That line isn't really necessary. Are you using python 3?
I've heard python described as the second best language at everything. That's what makes it a great hobby language, you can dabble in web development, data science, pretty much anything programming related. You have too much experience to be a junior dev, so I'd like to hear you tell me what you want to do, and then tell me you use python as your tool to get that job done. If you come in with a broad range of python skills, you'll get grilled on python, and that's where you're failing. If you come in as a guy who solved a specific problem at your last job, you'll get questioned on that. So whatever topic you are interested in, be it visualization, data cleaning, optimization, sell yourself as the guy who can do that, and then talk about python, not the other way around. For the python enthusiast who loves the language and can answer those questions you are struggling with, i.e. why not to use lists, I would give the opposite advice. Because your experience seems broad ranging, it might be easiest to steer the conversation to focus on that. They ask about a detail you aren't familiar with, tell them you work under tight deadlines to produce minimum viable products on a range of topics, give some examples of your quick turn around time, and maybe that will be sufficient.
Just do if trades no need to check len 
Thanks, that worked great.
Sorry, didn’t think to look for learnpython. I’ll use that in future. 
Sublime doesn't have code navigation? 
I'd like to add to the age thing. I hear 40 and 10 years experience, but I don't hear confidence. HR alone will force you into a higher pay grade in a lot of companies, so they will really want to know you are worth more than your younger counterparts. At my job, I'm mid level in the lowest grade for the role. Same person coming in with your experience would be starting two grades above me, so you'd start at about $15-20K more, bare minimum. If we are competing for the same spot, there is no way they would be as flexible with you as with me in terms of what they expect. So if you can't answer python questions, hopefully you have a long list of projects and deliverables that show a proven track record that a younger guy doesn't have.

Generally, this will be either a rule-based AI (if an item is used, and the item is a key, and the location is X then....) or it will be an "on_used" procedure attached to the item object.

That's how spacers were portrayed on HBO's Silicon Valley. An otherwise good show that got this aspect so very wrong.
This is super cool. Is it closed source? I’d love to help development.
Sounds like a homework problem. I'd start with something like [numpy.dot](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.dot.html).
See [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6294179/how-to-find-all-occurrences-of-an-element-in-a-list) StackOverflow thread for methods that will return multiple indices if the element occurs more than once.
You should create an inventory program that incorporates RFID technology, blockchain and maps. Here’s the real world scenario: You have a manufacturing plant that produces products with a high variance in size. Some of the products can range between 2in to 10ft in diameter. Currently there is no system in place to track the parts from the beginning of the manufacturing process until the end. Additionally, some of the parts need to be temporarily stored due to non conformance. While the end customer decides what do with the parts, these parts are moved around in the storage areas. They move around because of their awkward sizes. The problem is, when the customer comes back with a decision the parts can be anywhere in the storage areas and they must be found manually. The plant is currently keeping track of the parts with paper and pen and it’s obviously not very effective. Some of the parts are in Lots meaning entire orders can be placed on hold or partial orders. Likewise, when customers approve/accept parts they may only approve partially. This adds to the disorder and makes using a traditional barcode inventory system tricky. In addition to this employees in the yard make unauthorized part moves. How would you integrate, blockchain, RFID and maps to solve this issue? If you can find a solution to this not only do you have your thesis but you could have a lot of work after school. 
What do you need to do with the messages? If you just want to store the information in the db you can rely on a unique field to de-dup the records, and have as many instances as you like writing to the database.
First at all, Orthogonal, not "Ortogonal". And without symbolic computation you cannot reach this safely. People told you to sample from definition interval and use dot to check if zero, which is necessary but not sufficient. 
3. yes
This is so cool! I wish it was open source and ran locally though.
So you mean enforce unique keys at the DB, and just absorb any duplicate key errors in Python on insert? So there's two parts. I want to store the raw data (after cleaning it) so I can analyze and mess with it later on. This is market data, and the stream is giving me differential updates to the market's state, in terms of trades and open orders, which is why the real-time requirement is important. The second part, then, is using the stream to maintain my own version of the market's state, so whatever it is that de-duplicates the two streams must be efficient. I could just attach to one of the streams, but then it has to be able to switch immediately if the one drops. I'd rather set up the market state stuff behind some funnel that worries about de-duping, switching, etc., I just don't know what patterns exist for doing this.
Do your own homework. 
With this, you don't need an active backend to have interactivity/recalculations in the notebook. It's also easier to share this notebook with people not having Jupyter/Python installed. Of course there's a performance penalty since the Python interpreter is running inside a Javascript virtual machine, but if you don't do heavy calculations inside the notebook, then it does not matter much.
Not a fan of one letter variables. If you ever want to rename them you've got your work cut out for you.
Like you said, Lambda being serverless means every instance is at the very least not guaranteed to be reused/you should treat each cycle as completely separate. If you need that sort of optimisation for your app, why not just deploy the Flask app to Elastic Beanstalk? Might cost you more, but you make it sound like it's relatively high demand and would justify keeping a server up and running.
Not really? One might assume that the indices of all instances of that element would be returned, but it only returns the first. 
Yes I mention that in my post. But that causes you to move your hands from qwerty position
We all know it makes sense that it's there. It's a joke. And a good metaphore. Thanks for the laugh

Planet python doesn’t store more than a couple of days because we’re a sub? ;)
I am so glad I subscribed to this sub 
Nah, Python is a language that has a few of those gotchas, but unlike other languages they're well thought out and makes for a lot clearer code when people know about them. 
You mean for hosting the notebook?
[Python 3 docs](https://docs.python.org/3/) As configurations come in varying formats, here's a list of standard Python modules for parsing a few of the more popular. - [`configparser`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html) - [`json`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) - [`xml`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.html) Also, check out r/learnpython for any "how do I do this in python"-type questions. 
Hi! Thanks, it's closed source for now, but we might decide to open it up. 
It's in principle possible to run it locally, depending on the use-case, but it's meant to be a collaboration tool, so it's really tricky to get that to run locally :) 
You are right that lambdas are stateless, but you can declare and store variables outside of the scope of your lambda handler function. That means that you can create database connection or connection pool outside of handler function, which than can be shared in future invocation of the lambda.
you understand that 100 http requests i 1 second is different than just general simultanous threaded programming.... most websites don't like the same user requesting the same page or even domain too many times in a short period of time. basically they have protections against ddos attacks, so i guess you're asking how is it that i can do it.. well.....
My question was more specific to containers, not how to read an xml or json... For instance, in development I may be using command line args or a config yaml, but in production I may be using environment variables and I would be using the same docker image. 
Tabs are semantic and configurable. Spaces for separating tokens, tabs for indentation. 1 tab = 1 level of indentation.
But don't use XML or JSON if you want humans to edit the config. And don't use configparser at all because INI is a terrible format with no spec. If you want to use a different format, you need libraries. YAML is popular, but the library is huge because the spec is also huge. TOML is increasingly popular, is very human and machine readable, and has a number of small, light libraries available for it. It's the format python's \[new build config\]([https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/#file-format](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/#file-format)) is using.
Checking for the length feels super unpythonic to me.
Less visual noise.
Jupyter labs extensions 
well i just wrote quad core, because more cores can probably increase teh efficiency of multi threaded programming, but given the scenario of HTTP requests and responses, there are many more factors at play... literally every webmaster has heard of ddos.....
Is there a version of just the script generation I can run for myself locally?
No, we're doing the graph processing on the backend. But if you have a specific problem in mind, PM me, maybe we can help.
&gt;set a script to store links to the articles by scraping &amp;#x200B;
That sounds like an implementation detail. Either you parse a configuration file or you dont. If you need to parse arguments from the command like, look into the argparse module.

use something like envcfg. for dev, either autoenv or other set-and-forget tools, or else load some config file into os.environ and then just do env vars in the rest of the code.
I was making no argument over what configuration format is best.
I use this approach: https://github.com/rodenberg/configurator
The [interface](https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/03/explore-evictions-nb.gif) is a bit different , looking something like a mix of Matlab and Jupyter. This allows to separate code and visualization, while both being on the same screen, so I think in the end there is less clutter. &amp;#x200B; Scripts are text files, so all the diff and versioning tool that work well with text file, will work with Iodide.
I use python-decouple. Loads from .env (or .ini) file and works pretty well so far
When you called the function you passed the inputs as if they were keyword arguments, but in the function you declared them as normal arguments ( the difference is function(input1, input2, input3) is normal arguments but function(a=input1, b=input2, c=input3) uses keyword arguments). In the function then those objects are referred to as input1, input2, input3 for the normal arguments and a,b,c for the keyword argument case. 
The James comment in chat sold deserves an upvote.
I didn't say you were. I was building on top of your comment, which gave good references to stdlib options, to give advice to OP about config files in general.
/r/learnpython &gt;name 'num1' is not defined You haven't defined \`num1\`. Try defining \`num1\`. &amp;#x200B;
Gonna answer my own question after doing more research. This library is based on the one I mentioned in the title: [https://github.com/admiralobvious/vyper](https://github.com/admiralobvious/vyper)
[Or *can* you...](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0572/)

Every part of your reply resonates with me. I've totally been marketing myself all wrong; I'm not a Python programmer, I'm a python USER, and I can totally use Python as a data science engineer. Thank you!
Delete your... oh wait, you beat me to it.
That's true but it's obvious what I'm referring to.
Only the newest version is currently installed
I do actually have that track record, so I should stay the hell away from whiteboard interviews and concentrate on that. Thank you for telling me what I need to hear. Most of what I've done in the last four years is proprietary, but I can demonstrate my knowledge by describing those projects, and building up my GitHub. 
Really good advice. At my last job I was the guy you went to when your thing didn't work, and I made it work in record time, with code that passed tests and a very strict company-mandated Jenkins-based pylint. I need to focus on that and not on whiteboards.
Yeah, fuck \`logging\`. &amp;#x200B; For real though, py3 should have put deprecation warnings on all of its camel names and just made them aliases to properly-named stuff (you can already suppress deprecation warnings when you call the executable).
Or you could just use type annotations and a sane IDE.
I will fight anyone who uses camelCase in their python code, but if I could make everything, and PEP8, use camelCase, I probably would. 
Apparently not to you, because your question says that python isn't working, and then you explain that actually, python is working fine. We're not here to fix your poor choice of IDE.
It's that the Python Shell isn't functioning properly, of course fucking Python is working

All these provide you with an interface to manage the conversation so you can pretty much build an FAQ bot with these. However if you want your bot to sound more natural you might have to look into natural language understanding

But your problem is with IDLE, not the python interpreter.
What functionality does this add not included in "jupyter nbconvert"? It already can convert your notebooks to .py type files and is free and open source?

That’s a great question. With nbconvert, you still have to find another way to version control your data, variables, and code, and if you want to get an overview of what you did, you also need some tool from this. We are hinting towards this in the video when showing the version control workflow with git. With amie+fern, you don’t have to think about this, all iteration, re-runs, visualizations are stored in the amie graph based notebook on the cell level, so you can explore your workflow and when you want to go back to your favorite result, you can just generate that script with one click.
&gt; So you mean enforce unique keys at the DB, and just absorb any duplicate key errors in Python on insert? Pretty much. If you are inserting records from two processes, one will work, and the other would give you an integrity error. But it sounds like you want something more realtime than that. In that case, you could consider a Redis database which can maintain an in-memory queue. Multiple processes in various DCs can read from the websocket and push messages to that queue. You could also implement the deduping in Redis itself. Another process can then read from that queue, and do whatever in-memory processing you require. I think that would be a more scalable solution, and more reliable than attempting to switch between websockets on the fly. Although, that's a reasonable amount of engineering effort. If that websocket service is ever fixed, then running a single process on a single serve would be a far simpler solution. PS Consider Lomond for websockets.
It looks like it was fixed in this change: https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/89aa669dcc61
Eggcactly :p
Yeah I thought so, I understand it wouldn't exactly be profitable if that was the case. 
part of DE vs. DS is that you code more. a lot more.
Very cool! Looks alot more elegant then nbconvert w/ git. I totally see the use cases! Not something I'd be interesting in using if it isn't FOSS but best of luck!
Guess we'll have to fight then :D, cause I don't think I'll ever get used to writing in snake_case.

How about 1. return the n-th one via list.index(e, start) and a simple loop 2. [i for elt, i in enumerate(list) if you_elt == elt] or use numpy If you call for a list.indices method, as the use case is rare and has an overlap with numpy.ndarray, people might not that agree with you.
got it. thanks
Playing with muselsl. I found it interesting so much to watch my brainwave and to perform some machine learning tasks on.
Here is an article from AWS Database Blog (second point from section Tips on running the Python code explains some best practices for opening DB Connection): [Query your AWS database from your serverless application](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/query-your-aws-database-from-your-serverless-application/) Here is example from AWS Samples GitHub: [Dynamic Connections Management for RDS/RDBMS solutions](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-lambda-manage-rds-connections) Also nice article for best practices with serverless DB connections (although example uses JavaScript): [Best practices for Serverless: Connection Pooling your database](https://spotinst.com/blog/2017/11/19/best-practices-serverless-connection-pooling-database/)
&gt;Of course, it's definitely possible to overdo this -- then you get Perl. That's the Guido we know and love.
Certainly, you can *use* `list.index` to find the indices of every element, but OP asked whether `list.index` did it directly, so I thought it was worth clarifying.
A program that helps the company I work for efficiently allocate resources. Continuously updates multiple times per day, letting each market know how many workers to allocate to specific jobs. 
A OP5/Nagios notify plug-in that match alerts against rule files with regex patterns and sends out e-mails to the specified recipients if they match. Much easier than configuring it for each and every host and service individually. 
Yeah, I put 120 as the limit for every project I start. 80 is ridiculously narrow and just forces lots of unnecessary linebreaking that looks ugly and makes it harder to read. 
Every editor/IDE I’ve used can configure and convert space indentation on the fly as well. It’s just not an issue in 2019. 
First, don’t commit your virtual environment. They’re designed to be cheap to recreate so someone wanting to run your code can create one themselves. Instead, include a requirements.txt with any extra modules you’re using. You can generate a requirements.txt file by activating your venv and running ‘pip freeze’. Second, your README isn’t Python code, so the filename shouldn’t end with ‘.py’. If you rename that file as ‘README.md’ you can use [GitHub flavoured Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and GitHub will display the rendered file to people who visit your project. Third, you’ll make your life easier in the long run if you don’t but ampersands and other “special” characters in your filenames. It possible to work with them, but plenty of tools don’t handle them properly so it best to stick to letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores and periods. Finally, from a style point of view, don’t comment every line. It’s a lot of extra typing for very little gain. Instead, put a comment at the top of each function, class or method explaining what it’s for. It might be a good idea to read some Python code others have written — something well commented and straightforward would be ideal. I don’t know of a repo off the top of my head but a bit of googling might find some for you. 
Hey I need to do that too - upload files to SP, can you share your code ? Thanks
There's a lot of tutorials for discord bots. They have a much better api than slack does. There's a huge amoutn of tutorials for IRC (because of its age) but you don't want to go there.
You need to use the full path, not just the filename (its not got the directory part). See the docs for os.listdir but I think you need open `x.path` and not `x`. Please ask questions of this type in /r/learnpython.

Meh. I like overloading operators in intuitive ways because I it does indeed leverage a large body of experience I've had with operators (years of mathmatics instruction). On the other hand I don't think s-expressions are harder to get comfortable with. S-expressions are merely less familiar. On the plus side of the equation for s-exps they give a uniform language structure that makes meta programming (e.g. lisp macros) so much easier. examples 2 and 5 are s-expression-ish but not actual s-expressions. 
Only started really trying to learn python a week ago and yesterday I threw together a script to pull all TLS secrets out of our kubernetes clusters and listing either all of them, or just ones that are expired or will expire within x number days. I find it's easier to learn a language when I have a task in mind and learn on the fly. I imagine I'll look back at this script in a year and wonder wtf I was thinking, but that's a concern for future me.
it is very meta that the last paragraph says (paraphrasing) &gt;code for readability, then profile, only then optimize (meta because the most important statement is made at the end, as is good style) &amp;#x200B;
Yeah, but it's not on Windows and I don't want to fight that.
First you have to [/learnpython/](http://www.learnpython.reddit.com).
No
SublimeText 3 has folder navigation. 
yea i already know python. Thats why im asking...
Are you on Windows? Probably easiest for you there would be to add the Python environment variable permanently. Or else wrap everything in a script, which is a giant pain. I'm not, Ubuntu Linux. 
Very nice. Thank you. 
This is absolutely AMAZING and should be the highest rated post here! Is this what you do professionally?
I found a plugin for code navigation, do you not find it helpful?
This is an overdose of common sense.
Hell no.
why
&gt; so now we can write &gt; &gt; x + y + z (3) &gt; &gt; without ambiguity (it doesn't matter whether the + operator binds tighter to the left or to the right). Who do language designers fall into the trap of doing something fancy with operator overloading without thinking about the consequences when side effects are involved?
I use java but pretty sure u can make bar charts with Matplotlib. Animating them might be difficult but someone can prob help you out with that here.
Definitely an overdose of common sense... I’ve had lots of conversations with folks about programming language design but never heard any argue against operators. Even the most performant languages that we use have operators. I don’t even understand the point of the article.
what are you talking about?
Those are good points that Guido has made, but I think he missed the real reason people want`d1 + d2`. I wish there was a way in Python to operate on dictionary without mutating them. I'd be perfectly find with `d1 + d2` or `d1.union(d2) # or whatever syntax` like something similar to sets (which by the way doesn't have a `+` operator either)
its still two weeks until april first 🧐
Since I started using python there's two features I always thought were missing in the language: assignment expressions and + for dictionaries. I've spent hours reading the python-ideas mailing list archives to understand why they weren't in the language. The answer was always "Guido said he didn't like it". Seeing this radical 180° turn is quite surprising. 
Any yet there is not an operator to add two dicts, so clearly there are those who are arguing against them in the core python team, and I assume that this post is targeted directly at them. 
I don’t find this argument compelling at all. You’ll always be able to find something for which there is not an operator. Adding dictionaries is relatively an obscure use case. 
It's a common discussion in haskell and f#, since it's really easy to add custom operators in order to create your own DSLs. It's the norm in haskell (you need to learn multiple sets of custom operators to be productive in haskell...), while in F# custom operators is mostly considered a code smell.
I think very highly of Haskell. Don’t find understanding operators to be difficult in the least. Not too familiar with F# but it’s certainly not that widely used of a language.
There's the easy way and the hard way. Easy way: Make each individual graph as a separate image file (using `matplotlib`'s `save()` function). Then use ImageMagick's `convert` utility to make a gif (or whatever) out of the results. Hard way: `matplotlib` has an animation method, but I've always found it tricky to set up. Once you have the loop created it usually works OK, but it's impossible to remember what to do. Google it.
I can recommend this as a satisfied long time user. &amp;#x200B; &gt;Coldsweat is a Python web RSS aggregator and reader &amp;#x200B; [https://github.com/passiomatic/coldsweat](https://github.com/passiomatic/coldsweat) &amp;#x200B;
&gt; # CORRECTED: This line was previously wrong It really makes me feel a little better inside that even the Creator of Python can mess up simple operations. Most people _know_ that everyone does it, but still. 
can you be more specific? addition is a linear and order independent operation for all but the weirdest mathematics.
&gt;multiple users creating their accounts and posting their content You may find that a CMS, like plone, does this out of the box. [https://plone.org/](https://plone.org/)
Cool, it may become open source, so stay tuned :) 
Copying and updating a dictionary is obscure? Really? And add operator for dicts is precisely the example that Guido’s post concludes with. I think it’s fair to say that the point of this post is to persuade the reader that this would be useful. 
Thanks! I changed the variable name but I don't think I get your path idea, the examples I find online just use the file name without giving a long directory, also, would it still work on other computers?
It’s not to say that I don’t think it’d be useful but you will _always_ be able to find an example for a useful operator which isn’t supported. That’s not the same thing as saying that people are arguing against operators.
Love Python/Flask and learning penetration testing myself - this looks like it will be very useful! (If you haven't yet, you'd probably get a better response for this in r/netsec. I think you are being downvoted here due to the title, asking for feedback, due to the recent issue on this sub of posts requesting help, etc. You could even try reposting here with a title that provides a description of the tool as I have seen other security/penetration testing tools receive a positive response.) 
Update: I modified some code that I don't really need, still the same error, but I tried to print it... and: code: self.filelist = \[\] self.filelist = os.listdir(**'animation'**) print(filelist) &amp;#x200B; NameError: name 'filelist' is not defined &amp;#x200B; now my brain is melting even more, when I remove the print, it stops at the same line as before with the same error: self.surface = pygame.image.load(self.filelist\[self.num\]).convert() pygame.error: Couldn't open ocean\_bulles0001.png
never heard of Plone. That looks really interesting. Python has Wordpress alternative, thats cool. Thank you.
I’m not saying people are against operators In general. That would be a pretty ridiculous position. I’m asserting that there are people against the idea of dict operators, and that’s why Guido authored this blog post. Here’s a recently authored PEP for operators for dicts: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0584/ I think it’s fair to conclude that this was on Guido’s mind when he wrote his blog post. I think it’s also fair to say, given that it’s taken a decade to land this obvious idea, that there have been detractors along the way, and if I had the energy I’m sure I could find a number of detractors to this specific PEP in python-ideas mailing list.

And I tried: self.filelist = os.listdir(**'E:/C5/animation'**), same error
Honestly, I don't know if i can give you a valid answer now that I'm on the spot hahaha. I think the reason I switched was due to how each package accesses files? I believe xlrd has to load the whole file into memory and openpyxl is able to load row by row? I'm not sure, but if xlrd works for you of course keep using it! 
Hey, sorry to bother y'all but I need some help... I just took some python beginner classes (a 6 hour course actually) and learned the basics. I'm absolutely loving and into it but I don't know what to do now, since I cannot find a decent "mid-level" (?) course. Thanks in advance!
Thanks, I’ll try it there 
Python: You can overdo operators, then you get Perl. Perl: Man, don't even... Haskell: Hold my beer.
How do you add these two dictionaries? d1 = {'key' : 3} and d2 = {'key': 'foo'}
Not for dicts in this case, if they share a common key. The value of the right hand dict will overwrite the left hand.
There's a [PEP](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0584/) to add the + operator to the native dict in python. Apparently, a significant number of people are opposed to it. The reason usually given is because it's not cummutative (x + y != y + x), and they think that makes the operator confusing (even though it's already true for other native types, like string concatenation). 
sets use the `|` operator for "addition" (union)
I haven't don't it yet I just finished a script to change my wireless router channel automatically I need to get that running on Android then I was prolly going to look at automating some of these work tasks
I wouldn't say that string concatenation is "weird mathematics", and order has always mattered there when it comes to addition.
it was defined earlier in the variable before the line break.
I'm afraid we both have got stuck at 8kyu...
Why? I am. I just copied and pasted yours to see if it would work because I wanted a working script and an experimental script.
Well naively you'd make `d1 + d2` shorthand for `d1.update(d2)`. I know addition is generally commutative, and this wouldn't be, but I don't think it's a huge hurdle for people to overcome either. It matches common sense, even if `d1 + d2 != d2 + d1`
Thank you I will post it there, and subscribe. I didn't know it existed.
That’s an argument against a very particular operator though. Not against operators in general. The article is a justification of operators in general. The people opposing that particular operator aren’t opposed to operators at all, they just think that there should be some restrictions on what constitutes an operator.
That should work, at least it worked for me in idle. The line isn't necessary for the running of the code, so you could remove it and the code would still work.
Except that the bulk of the blog post pertains to operators in general...
concatenation isn't precisely addition, and the context of my point is pretty clear.
yeah common key is an ambiguity

Wait a minute, I am using Pycharm and I used the sys.version command and I got this: 2.7.10 (default, Aug 17 2018, 19:45:58) [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 10.0.0 (clang-1000.0.42)]
&gt;x+y == y+x This doesn't hold for any of the examples where the + operator is overloaded: string and concatenation or dict merging &amp;#x200B;
Oh, on mobile so can't format properly, but you could replace it with: print("total is {}".format(total)) Or something similar. Or you could switch to python 3, which would be best, but I have no idea how
Yay! It works! 
Hahah alright. I think you're right about xlrd opening the whole file, but the files I use, I haven't seen one longer than 500 rows and haven't seen an issue yet. 
Yes, but string concatenation uses the + operator. Maybe I mistook your argument, but it seemed like you were arguing the + operator isn't appropriate for dict merging because it's not commutative, and *most* addition operations are commutative, which is why I provided a very common example (string concatenation) which isn't commutative either.
The argument is the same either way. Just because someone isn't opposed to *all* operators doesn't mean they're still not taking a far too purest stance in regards to operators in general. The point Guido is trying to get across is that operators are superior for code readability, *even* when the operator isn't *perfectly* analogous to the operation being performed, and Readability Counts more than anything else in language design. 
no it was more of an argument in general re: mathematics but the more i think about it, the less thrilled i am with the operator because of the commutation issue. this was an issue with the := assignment operator, which was settled with a new symbol and a limited context of use. though the same problems are here with +.

&gt; the less thrilled i am with the operator because of the commutation issue. Like I said, there's already a precedent for it with string concatenation. &gt; this was an issue with the := assignment operator, which was settled with a new symbol and a limited context of use. Actually, it was the opposite. Pretty much everyone recognized the need for the assignment expressions, they just disagreed on the syntax and how general it needed to be. The most prominent alternative was to re-use the `as` keyword with a limited context, but that would have made the operator much less useful, and expanding it to be more general would have lead to ambiguous syntax (like inside with statements) without a confusing parenthesis syntax. The accepted proposal for assignment expressions *doesn't* have a limited context like the alternatives. It's general and works everywhere an expression would be accepted. Are you saying there are people proposing an alternative operator for the dict merge operation? I've seen some people propose `|`, but that's not perfectly analogous to dict merging either. It actually seems far less intuitive to add *a new* operator just for dict merging. This is a great example of where **Practicality beats Purity**.
ok thank you

Related: [Growing a Language by Guy Steele](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0). Amazing talk. He makes a pretty compelling case for overloaded operators.

Maybe not directly relevant in r/python, but: I appreciate Haskell as a language, though I haven’t written any serious applications (maybe a couple thousand lines of code). I’ve always found the less common operators hard to understand, because they’re not easy to search for and most imports aren’t qualified. Is there some trick to inferring their meaning?
Yes but I find the argumentation weird - operators help us to see the associative and commutative nature of additions, mathematicians define the plus operator in various vector spaces according to these rules - and now we use the same operator for something completely different. The analogy holds only on the level that is simplifies notation, so better not to use this analogy in my opinion.
\&gt;paying for his poor choices in his 20s and choosing a dying industry in his 30s would be welcome. Just out of curiosity-- What dying industry are you talking about? &amp;#x200B; jQuery isn't really in vogue anymore, I'd learn ReactJS or Vue. Personally, I chose ReactJS. For ReactJS, I'd suggest learning a bit about webpack, then learning ReactJS. Check out Udemy video series on both (some of these can be pirated). Also [allITebooks.com](https://allITebooks.com) has tons of books. Create things. Make small projects, and then iterate on them two or three times to improve them. Then create a slightly more complex project. Rinse and repeat. ML/AI does seem like the next IT frontier. But it's a bit tricky to wrap one's mind around without a couple statistics classes under your belt. That's all I've taken, and am just barely able to follow along with books on Keras &amp; OpenCV
Perl 6 design document on operators that explains rationale : https://perl6.org/archive/doc/design/apo/A03.html
Strings aren't commutative either. They don't have a subtract or divide either, but they have a multiply,, but no exponentiation.
&gt; examples 2 and 5 are s-expression-ish but not actual s-expressions. I'm not sure what you;re trying to highlight here but most versions of lisp have atoms as part of their definition of [s-expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression). Literal numbers are atoms and therefore they **are** s-expressions.
And ironically, set unions are commutative.
We need more details. How do you want to talk to the rpi? Uart, ethernet, lora, etc?
matplotlib interactive mode helps. https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.ion.html 
Nice job =)
Thanks for sharing this. 
Honestly never even thought about it haha. This code is quite small so it is manageable with out it. I can imagine for really large projects it would be necessary. Thanks for sharing this. 
I'm just grateful for all the work that other folks have done to make python as effective as it is. 
&gt;is the point that numbers aren't surrounded by parentheses yes. see [meta-programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming) on wikipedia. quote &gt; [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) is probably the quintessential language with metaprogramming facilities, both because of its historical precedence and because of the simplicity and power of its metaprogramming. In Lisp metaprogramming, the unquote operator (typically a comma) introduces code that is evaluated at program definition time rather than at run time; see [Self-evaluating forms and quoting in Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)#Self-evaluating_forms_and_quoting). **The metaprogramming language is thus identical to the host programming language, and existing Lisp routines can be directly reused for metaprogramming, if desired.** (my emphasis). The bold part is very powerful. In C++ (and most other languages, like python) the meta-programming language is a completely different language than the non-meta-programming part of the language and it is typically hard work to learn to meta program. If become good at regular lisp programming then you will find writing macros (meta programming) easy. &amp;#x200B; How this relates to the Guido post is that I wonder if infix notation. E.g. &amp;#x200B; x = 6 \* y + z &amp;#x200B; is really that much easier for humans to understand than &amp;#x200B; (setq x (+ z (\* 6 y))) &amp;#x200B; or is it simply a matter of getting used to a particular format. Sure, infix is a bit more terse but that is because information is hidden in precedence rules. I'm not saying "s-exps are just as easy to read as infix" I'm wondering if this might be the case if someone was taught math from the beginning using s-exp notation. As a mere lisp ex-dilettante (it has been so long since I lisped that I'm not even a dilettante these days) I'm not really qualified to say with authority "lisp is the most kick ass meta-programming language" but it sure seemed that way to my neophyte's eye. If it **is** the most kick ass meta-programming language then fact that code and data are usually represented as s-expressions is a major contributing factor as to why.
&gt; even if d1 + d2 != d2 + d1 This is a big problem for me. [See](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#Properties) If some operation doesn't follow all the rules of addition, it can't use the `+` operator. 
I was a programmer when he gave that talk but I only saw it on youtube this last year. AMAZING talk. I feel as if Python has executed well on many of the things Steele is advocating in that talk. &amp;#x200B; It is interesting that Steele has a lot of experience with lisp (whose macros inspire a state of awe in me) yet he moved away from lisp. Lisp macros are a thing of beauty but maybe s-expressions are just not worth what lisp macros buy you. Or perhaps it is more a matter of infix notation simply being there first. Like the QWERTY keyboard layout. Horribly suboptimal but still not worth the effort to convert to a better layout. &amp;#x200B; The talk is long (an hour) but worth your time if you are a programming language nerd. Be patient with the slow start.
&gt; Copying and updating a dictionary is obscure? Really? This in itself is not obscure, but `a + b` where both `a` and `b` are dicts is certainly obscure. Addition is always cummulative and `+` is used for addition, however updating dicts is _not_ a cummulative operation. 
&gt; Actually, it was the opposite. i disagree. i specifically remember this being one of the arguments with regards to assignment ambiguity and why it is the way it is now. &gt; Are you saying there are people proposing an alternative operator for the dict merge operation? no &gt;It actually seems far less intuitive to add a new operator just for dict merging. i'm not sure it needs a new operator. "+" does what is expected, the problem is how to handle duplicate keys and which in "a + b" gets clobbered. tuples and arrays do not have this problem, for example. i suppose one could do an exception if there are duplicate keys but that seems like overkill. i'm not sure. for dict merging i'd probably stick with a functional approach unless its immediately clear how "+" works in the case of dicts in the case of common keys. 
Sure, except: * By choosing the operators wisely, mathematicians can employ their visual brain to help them do math better Except for +,-,*,:, they didn't do that. * What ***is*** the meaning of d1+d2 Is it d1.update(d2), is it d2.update(d1)? Really what would be needed are set operations and good luck finding those on any keyboard.
&gt; the problem is how to handle duplicate keys and which in "a + b" gets clobbered. This isn't really a problem. It would do exactly what people do now in a much more verbose and difficult to read format ``` d = a.copy() d.update(b) # OR d = a + b ``` `b` clobbers `a`. 
Would you mind unpacking how different machines would push into Redis?

5. Find better wallpapers
work-from-home ? yes if you can find them
which is reasonable, but without being told this is the behavior why would you think that? i mean i guess at some point it boils down to "read the documentation", but it just bugs me in a deep way way that addition is a non-commutative operation
For this things I break out the functional style: list(filter(is_sample, samples))
So I recently picked up pandas and didn't like matplot at all and gave up. Now I'm learning plotly and I'm able to do everything as matplot, am I hurting myself in any way? 
I'd actually say Prolog is the quintessential language with metaprogramming facilities. In Lisp macros are considered an advanced feature, in Prolog macros are considered routine.
I mean, not all groups are abelian.
String concatenation, anyone?
I think PascalCase should be reserved for Classes that aren't the basic atomic types like int and float that for some reason seem generally accepted to be things you write lowercase. 
Arduino has really gotten me on the camelCase so I mostly totally ignore pep8 and use it anyway.
I have private data that cannot go on some other system except as results. How does fern protect against storing my data on their system?
The Zen of Python is fantastic as is because it fixes and explains it's own annoyances and avoids getting into old unixy worse is better stuff. Maybe I'd add a line that says "Performance is always critical, but not everything is performance critical", meaning that Python's dynamicness makes it easy to include all manner of interfaces to whatever you need, but ten extra if statements that only run once a minute are fine. PEP8 is mostly fine, but I'm not giving up my camelCase.
Looks very useful. I find myself repeatedly implementing certain things, like a WeakValueDict that can't change except under lock, etc. One thing I use a lot is saving small data files, but backing up the old one, and auto loading the backup. On POSIX atomic rename helps a lot, but in general I make a tilde file backup, start writing the file, and then delete the tilde backup. If the tilde file exists, I load that, otherwise, I load the actual file. Should probably not try making a backup if one already exists also.
Actually, development using FastAPI has been significantly faster for our team (and some other teams). &amp;#x200B; FastAPI has a powerful but simple dependency injection system. It allows you to write a lot of the functionality normally covered by a custom plug-in in a simple (two line) function. &amp;#x200B; This includes things like: * Authentication (with JWT tokens, Cookies or any other method) * Role checking ("only a superuser user can access this") * Integration with different databases (including relational and NoSQL) &amp;#x200B; That makes it more closer to "unlimited plug-ins", as for most of the cases you don't really need an actual plug-in. &amp;#x200B; Apart from that, there are many Flask or Django plug-ins that cover things that are already included in FastAPI, like data validation, data serialization, API documentation, GraphQL integration, Testing, etc. &amp;#x200B; And indeed, there are plug-ins for other cases (anything compatible with Starlette or ASGI in general). &amp;#x200B; For example: * Deployment to cloud function services (also called "serverless") with: [https://github.com/erm/mangum](https://github.com/erm/mangum) * Django-channels like Websockets management: [https://github.com/taoufik07/nejma](https://github.com/taoufik07/nejma) * You can even mount Socket-IO with ASGI: [https://python-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html](https://python-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html) &amp;#x200B; If there's a plug-in (set of plug-ins) or functionality that you see is not covered, I would like to know it, to see what would be the bests way to cover those cases. &amp;#x200B; Now, about using it commercially, I understand your opinion. But still, just so you know, it has worked quite well for commercial projects in our team and in several other teams (including Microsoft).

Monte Carlo, but extended to 3D with a model of an actual pie. Which is not a cylinder, making it very inaccurate, but is rotationally symmetric, so you could use vertical layers that you treat like circles in the traditional method, and average them.
They are more or less on the same ballpark, both WSGI. The slight difference shouldn't be taken too hard, as it might vary a bit from one run of the benchmark to the next. &amp;#x200B; If you want to speed things up, you might want to try one of these new frameworks (of course, I would suggest FastAPI).
I'm a fan of Mako although there's a few things I'd like to change. Particularly the lack of IDE support. But generally, It's very readable, and easy to write in.
Yeah, slight differences might be vary by each run of the benchmarks. I wouldn't take small differences too seriously. &amp;#x200B; In some benchmarks, FastAPI seems faster even than Starlette and Uvicorn, although it shouldn't, as it is just adding code on top of Starlette, that in turn is adding code "on top of" Uvicorn. &amp;#x200B; All this having in mind that Uvicorn is a server, not a framework, Starlette is a microframework/toolkit and FastAPI is a miniframework for APIs built on top of Starlette. But still, they are more or less "on the same ballpark".
IMHO you shouldn't actively try to use most techniques. That's how you get some JavaScript libraries with the "Absolutely everything must involved a continuation and nothing can be synchronous but somehow you can still make it slow" thing. I only use lambdas for very simple things. They're useful for the key function of sorting and stuff like that. But more often I'll just define a closure with the usual function syntax. I'm a fan of OOP(In general, not the crazy inheritance chains a mile long and stuff), and prefer OO to imperative/functional style, but that's likely personal bias. Actively trying to use any particular technique makes programs look like computer science textbook problems instead of practical implementations.
Python already has set operators: `|` and `&amp;`
And they look nothing like the oh so wisely chose math operators.
Blockchain isn't about efficiency. It's about believing that the advantages are so important they are worth the tremendous cost in CPU and storage. They don't particularly interested me, but the people that use them see the massive mining farms as electricity well spent. Iterating over the chain at startup then incrementally modifying the totals seems reasonable by cryptocurrency standards.
My preferred solution is PyQt/Pyside. I've never seen anything else that's quite as polished and easy to use. Because it's more than just a UI framework. It handles things like watching the filesystem to make sure your file sidebar updates, and it does all the little extra things like tooltips, CSS theming, rich text editing, that you might want. And somehow, it *still* manages to load super fast even on old machines. Otherwise, TK is Python's native UI, and there's piles of other lightweight UI frameworks if you're just doing something ultra simple. I also like web UIs(NOT electron, real web browser based stuff), because you can control it remotely if you have security set up. 
You are right, I did get a better response there. Thanks for the hint, will try to repost.
Exactly. This has been shorthand in so many places. Set addition would be the same, because o different objects can still be equal (eg if you overload the equality operation). 
Web is too much in my opinion for the reason that this is a basic cli application. Thanks for the recommendation on pyqt, i’ll have a look at it. Although i likely won’t need those awesome features you mentioned. 
Yes let's talk about it. It's annoying. But not that annoying. Because it's not actually as global as they say. Things running in C are free to release it. Plenty of Numpy functions let go of the GIL. I'm not sure if regex does, but there's an extension that does. And you can even just jse external processes for things like audio that need to be realtime. People don't write high performance inner loops in Python.
Looks really useful. Not necessary, but nice to have.
Background tasks are mainly for when you don't need to return the result of the background task to the user. For example, sending an email notification, triggering processing of some data, etc. &amp;#x200B; If you need to tell the client/user "sure, received your request, now we are processing", and then want the client to ask "how is my thing doing? is it done?", you would probably create one endpoint to receive the request, start the background task (and the background task would save something to a database after finishing), return immediately with the "sure, received" and then another endpoint where the client can ask "is my thing done yet?", and that second endpoint would check in the database if the result from the background task is there yet or not.
:D
Utterly pointless. As a java developer I learned python 4 years ago but the learning curve is so low nobody will ever need this library 
Some argue it shouldn't be done using `+`. In Julia for example, string concatenation is done using the `*` operator. Which is the established notation (in maths communities, at least) for non commutative group operations.
lol
Can we please get a decorator for supplying argument documentation or something so people can stop using annotations for anything but typing? Docstring rst syntax can be annoying and introspection is nice, but type annotations are important. Something like: @doc("paramName", "This is an example") @doc("paramName", "Another example") @doc("return", "Some example data is returned") 
Upwork
Good but just one thing I must mention since it's quite important, never ever check in .pyc files, it's just not done, nobody does that.
String concatenation is not commutative, but is easily understood.

I don't give a fuck if you think I'm an arsehole for telling you what you did wrong **and why it was wrong** instead of doing your homework for you, so long as you learn not to do it again.
If you know that `|` represents 'or' and `&amp;` represents 'and' then their use as `union` and `untersection` does make sense: Union = elem if elem in a OR b Intersection = elem if elem in a AND b
&gt; qwerty as an emacs user, always a hand of mine is around CTRL LOL
I'm talking about A ∩ B. That you can construct them as functions is obvious, the question is about what kind of symbol to use as operator. The default choice, the symbol I wrote above, is a no-go, because it's not a keyboard and anything else is unconventional by definition. Also, in this case it's slightly different because what's actually done is update forms a union, but overwrites existing values. That's something math doesn't really "do". So the concept of "union" doesn't even properly apply.
I prefer tabs but when in Rome, as they say. 
Your objection is that the symbol changes meaning across domain, and that this encourages confusion. There is a sense to this. &amp;#x200B; What if we could define non-symbolic operators? For example, we could have a rule that you could refer to an operator by putting colons around a token. &amp;#x200B; Create \_\_op\_join\_\_ as a method against d1. &amp;#x200B; Use it like this, d1 :join: d2 &amp;#x200B; The key idea here is disconnecting the idea of operator from the limited number of symbols we have conveniently available on the keyboard. And, avoiding repurposing those symbols to causes different to their use in mathematics. Some might argue for a different representation than leading-character period. That is important, but downstream from the central idea. &amp;#x200B;

Because English reads left to right and things on the right happen last. d[1] = 2 d[1] = 3 You'd have to check the docs to be sure but it's very obvious I think. 
Something like this? values = range(len(my_list)) dictionary = dict(zip(my_list, values))
