Not mine
Happy cake day!
Thank you for replying. However, I still don't quite understand your answer. I looked up anaconda's license and saw a 3 clause BSD. Does that mean I can do what i mentioned above just by copying the license and put it in the environment?
It's likely that PyCharm has created a virtual environment for your project. In that case you need to install PySimpleGUI into that, which can be done from within PyCharm
Any reason why you are defining your return type? Is this for readability?
I have not read the BSD license, so I cannot answer your question directly. All I can say is that there will be something about how you're allowed to distribute the content somewhere in the license. I think you have it right, but I'm not sure. 
this. I literally completed only couple of basic tutorials on 3d graphics. Don't know why so many people got excited. 
Python itself -- including Anaconda -- has a whole bunch of compiled files within it that are architecture and OS specific, so the simple answer to the cross-platform part is "no, absolutely not". There are tools out there that you can use to freeze an interpreter and your code together into an "executable" file on a per OS basis, but you'll need a machine (or at least a VM) for each OS and architecture you want to build for to make executables for each distribution target. By far the simplest and best method is to properly package your work into something that can be uploaded to PyPi and then installed with `pip`... if your code is itself pure Python then anyone with a working `pip` installation can install your code (assuming your code is compatible with their Python version), and that eliminates the worry about OS and architecture issues. Given that you're using Anaconda you can also build a conda package and distribute that way, but realize up front you're limiting your audience to users of Anaconda, which is certainly popular but by no means the most common Python distribution.
Are you admin of the system? Can you right click and run the file as Administrator? 
Yeah you can do that if need be. However Tkinter does have some issues with other thread's running. Read up on how to implement another thread with a tkinter gui.
Take a look at [Plyer](https://plyer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
Distribute only your code, with file `requirements.txt` that can be used in command `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Or better, build an Egg or Wheel package: https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/
I'm considering it. Is it a good introduction to Python? &amp;#x200B; I studied linguistics at the university, and thought it would be interesting to pick up a "computer language" next.
Nice! I also wrote one a few years back - [http://www.algorithm.co.il/blogs/programming/python-curses-numpy-ascii-art-rotating-cube/](http://www.algorithm.co.il/blogs/programming/python-curses-numpy-ascii-art-rotating-cube/)
I answered about 70% of middle level and 80% of senior level questions, What now?
Now I can finally hack the mainframe
No, what's that?
Thank you for your reply, but what I want to do is deploy an open source desktop application for windows 64bit (e.g. audacity). Can i distribute my code then, with the way mentioned above? Thx
Good for you then. But I don't remember talking to you - these questions intend to open a discussion with a candidate, and I didn't put any percentage anyway
Thank you! I now know how to deploy my app with the freeze method! But as for the PyPi method, could you please elaborate on how I can make sure the app runs correctly as a desktop for people who had not installed python on their computer?
Maybe when there's Python4? 
Check license agreement to make sure you can redistribute the software (Open Source does not mean free to distribute in binary form). Eggs and Wheels are designed for distribution of Python code and binary libraries used as modules. It is not designed for distribution of arbitrary software. You can use installers for Windows, like MSI or InstallShield.
Thank you so much for the info!
&gt;You're assigning your iterative variables to i and j, but you're referring to your axes as first\_index and second\_index, which don't change in the same way. I changed my original post; that was a typo. &gt;Also, you're assigning to the axis array rather than plotting using it. What you probably want is &gt; &gt;ax\_arr\[i, j\].plot(some, arguments, here) Yes, however, as I stated in my original post, my own (custom) `plot_2d` function is in a file called `myfile`. *How could I call the plotting function then?* Thanks in advance!
Well it depends. Numpy has a bit of overhead, which pays off nicely if you're really operating on a whole lot of values and taking advantage of the vectorization it provides. I did a simple test, computing the sines of a bunch of random numbers. On my laptop, computing a `math.sin` takes on average about 40 ns on a single number. If you do it by looping over a list or tuple (doesn't matter much which), the overhead of handling a sequence becomes essentially irrelevant once its length is about fifty or so, and the average time per sine flattens out to about 50 ns. When using `numpy.sin`, computing the sine of a scalar takes on an average about 400 ns (yes, four hundred). But when computing it vectorially on a `numpy.array`, the overhead is essentially constant no matter what the size, so as you might expect, you break even as soon as you have at least ten or so sines to compute. At array size of a hundred, you're down to about 20 ns per sine. By the way, computing simple math functions (like the sine) is so fast that it's pointless to cache the results at the Python level -- fetching from the cache takes at least as long as computing. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
lxml is faster, but the learning curve is steep if you aren't familiar with xpath.
Well there's the rub... the `pip` approach only works if your user has a Python interpreter installed. This is broadly speaking the problem of distribution; you either take the source and build all the artifacts for all the various systems, or you send the user your source and they build those artifacts on their various systems. The latter is the mechanism Python was designed for, which is why trying to do it any other way involves hacks and workarounds like PyInstaller. Nothing wrong with going the hack route, but it means having the resources to build artifacts for each of the target systems your users employ. Personally I've always felt it's better to teach people how to install Python once.

If you can spend a lot you can go faster. It is free and very popular a lot of people will be in the forum to help learners. I dont know if you get extra friendlier help if you pay ($49?) but it could worth it if that's the case considering the quality and the volume of the material. You really want to go through the lectures. Each is long so try to speed up with 1.25x. If you want to learn python then it comes after learning c and javascript with web development I think. You can go back to the c programming to actually work on the hw to submit after watching 7 lecture videos to learn python. So if you watch one lecture a day you can get to python lecture next week with some fundamental knowledge on computer science. Because you can watch again later you can focus on going through for the first 7 lectures. Maybe you can run the video with 1.5x and watch two lectures a day. You can skip short videos following the main lecture for the first round.
General knowledge of most 3rd party librairies. This takes a while to achieve, and will take as well a huge amount of your time on a daily basis to keep up with the new trends. But it's all worth it. Every minute. 
try finding libiomp5md.dll in My Computer, it should list you a couple of libiomp5md.dll files in different directoryes (system32, Anaconda3, i had one in premiere pro), then rename the ones that are not in Anacodna (for example disable\_libiomp5md.dll). It worked for me 
Very interesting and we'll written code

I would think working with APIs is key in IT. I've used Python for data munging, and if you do that, then learn pandas, numpy, etc.... Otherwise, you are probably using Python to automate interactions with APIs -- at least in an IT job.

Open your web browsers network monitor where you can see a list of all the requests the webpage is making. The page itself will make a http request to get the odds then display it, if you can find that request then you can replicate it in python and potentially receive the data directly rather than having to scrape the HTML 
so a search for "span data-coef" in the source doesn't return anything? what does `curl -LI &lt;&lt;URL&gt;&gt;` return?
Really depends on where you are heading. Software engineer or computer scientist? Avoid learning the details of Python specifically and focus on algorithms and data structures. Anything else? Focus on whatever problems you want to solve.

I would also recommend increasing the default buffer size in the uwsgi.ini file. If not, nginx will return 502 if the http response from the flask app is larger than the buffer size of uwsgi. I think default is 4096. I set mine to 65536. 
If you are interested in web development, learn Django one of the best framework written on python. They are lot of job opportunities too.

Well-written? Using 100 points to draw a line, just to be sure, instead of something better, like Bresenham's algorithm from 1962?
First of all, thanks so much for Advent of Code. I did it last year, and I think the things I learned made a big difference in my job search as a career-switcher. I wanted to ask if you'd consider providing an example input for each problem that is the same for everyone. This would allow people to include tests in their GitHub repos, etc. without having to pack in their personal puzzle inputs. I think you've mentioned somewhere that you'd like to avoid having all the inputs laid out on the open Internet, so this could help with that goal somewhat.
What is wks, a sheet object? Hard to tell what you’re trying to do. Did you make a class for it? Generally, after you authenticate and establish service, you pass a 2d array to the API’s spreadsheets().values() append method as the body of your request along with sheetId, range, valueInputOption and insertDataOption. The array is passed in a dictionary/JSON for the body argument like: {‘values’:data}
I've mostly been using python for some basic data analysis, so I'm just curious: why are you suggesting the specific combination of Python and Powershell?

I started with a book "How To Think Like A Computer Scientist". It's free and a great introduction to basic pythonic data structures and syntax. It also depends on what you're planning on doing. If it's for engineering, get your hands dirty with numpy and scipy asap. Python's great advantage is its community and the sheer amount of fantastic, professionally maintained modules.

&gt; So if you have to click something to get the data , you are back to selenium right? I think you can also use pyppeteer for this. But you definitely can't use requests-html.
I've tried to research this before too and I've found it isn't possible to control the individual lights on a strip
What I do is that my plotting functions all look like this: ```python from matplotlib import pyplot as plt def my_plot_function(data, ax=None): if not ax: _, ax = plt.subplots() ax.do_whatever_else() ``` Then you can pass the axis you're working on into the function, but if you don't, it creates a new single-axis figure. I suspect it's also possible to set the global current axis from outside the function, and then get the global current axis from inside it, with `plt.sca(ax)` and `ax = plt.gca()` respectively, but that's not a good way of doing it.
I'm looking at purely style and structure, not algorithmic beauty. If you've been through the source of most posts on here, they're usually hundred lines of nested ifs and weird gunk. This one was clean and organized. Many small, short functions.
The LED's on the strip aren't individually addressable, so special effects like a progress bar are pretty much out. I've used qhue for quite a while because the abstraction is very simple.
You don't really need to run the msi. Just download the archive and extract it somewhere. Then modify system PATH variable to point to the directory where you extracted Python (where python.exe lives) and to the `bin` directory under it (there are some more utilities there, like `pip` and `venv`). That's all what this installation does, basically.
I've never done something like this before, but I'm 2 for 2 on the second day in saving Christmas. Seems like a fun way to work on my problem solving techniques. I look forward to bashing my head against a wall and learning new things.
That's not really a great solution for Anaconda. It might just not work / not do what you would expect. Anaconda manages its packages differently, and trying to mix `pip` / `setuptools` into the picture is going to cause some problems down the line.

Pygame is probably the best thing when it comes to python. But python just isnt great at all when it comes to games, I might not like the language but javascript has a lot more choice, for instance phaser.js.
We don't talk about lambada here. It is forbidden.
if script was launched directly (python this_script.py) then run main(). if script was just imported from another script then don't run main()
This isn't my area, but I've seen a lot of discussion about this over the years, just know that it's not personal experience. The main issues all boil down to speed and feature set. It's community-driven Python, so it's never going to come anywhere near the performance or features of a commercial engine like Unity or Unreal Engine. It's not as well documented, it doesn't have the libraries of assets or the huge base of tutorials or users, and at the end of the day it's Python so it's basically got a terrible distribution story. If what you want to do fits within its sweet spot there's absolutely no reason not to use it... but that said, if your long term ambitions move outside that sweet spot then you're going to end up moving to a commercial engine anyway, so there's an argument against investing in something you're almost certainly outgrow. Bedsides, it's really not that hard to pick up other scripting languages.
Even better is remembering at least 80% of standard library. There is so much useful stuff in there it's difficult to remember it all.

I guess it has to do with certain limitations Python has when modifying or creating stuff related to Windows. Like touching the registry, moving folders or creating folders. Powershell afaik has a more streamlined and simple syntax/commands for that.
Don't let the inability to individually address those LEDs discourage you though, there are plenty of other strips out there that are individually addressable.

This question is probably better suited to /r/learnpython than here. That said, there really isn't a single best way to do this. There are tons of different viable approaches, and what makes the most sense will depend on what you're trying to accomplish. I'd encourage you post on /r/learnpython with more details about what you're doing.
Depends on what you are trying to accomplish. From your minimal description: [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/multiprocessing.html)
I prefer using [concurrent.futures](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html) Choose a thread pool for any IO bound work, and a process pool only if you have CPU bound workloads.

Thanks for the advice, i'll definitely look into TOML, it does look insanely smooth to work with in comparison to the other ones.
Can you look at it? How is the function determining which axis to use? If it's just doing `plt.gca()`, then you should be able to `plt.sca(ax[i,j])` outside the function (i.e. in your code).
What exactly are you interested in? Only strings or strings and symbols (interned string)? What memory? The stack of Python interpreter? The stack of C runtime? The heap of Python interpreter? The heap of C runtime? What about statically allocated stuff? What about symbols loaded from shared libraries? What if Python runs in multiple processes, do you want it per process or cumulative (processes can share memory).

that was it. Thank you so much!
Ugh for packing so much unpythonic code in such a brief snippet. 1. Incorrectly used equality operator `==` to attempt to assign `=` to the variable `win`. * Variable names should be lowercase. E.g., change `Your_guess` and `Turns` to `your_guess` and `turns`. * The `break` is completely unnecessary (without the earlier error). * It doesn't gracefully handle entering things that can't be cast to ints. * Should put single space around comparison operators (`==` and `&gt;`. * Inconsistent capitalization in messages to users. I'd probably fix the code to be: import random random_number = random.randint(1,100) won = False turns = 0 while not won: try: guess = input("Enter a number between 1 and 100") guess = int(guess) except ValueError: print("The following is not a valid number: ", guess) print("Please try again.") continue turns +=1 if random_number == guess: print("You won!") print("Number of turns you have used: ", turns) won = True break else: if random_number &gt; guess: print("Your Guess was low, Please enter a higher number") else: print("Your guess was high, please enter a lower number")
Describe the problem more fully to help us decide between alternate methods. Are you talking about client/server or multiprocessing? 
For not being shootted into his leg by himself, of course.
There is no such thing as asynchronous file I/O in Python. Not only that, there isn't really such a thing in many operating systems where Python runs (for instance, Linux). So, the correct answer to your question: &gt; If not, is there any good asynchronous logging libraries out there? is simple: No, and don't expect any to appear in the near future, unless you are willing to log to something like TCP socket instead of a file. So... you've heard different, right? Well, you can achieve something that's similar to asynchronous I/O: you can have multiple threads block on I/O operations. This will inevitably be very coarse-grained and inefficient, but this is how most of the world works... The very few write their own drivers, or, perhaps even kernels and have a completely custom data-path, but you will probably only find such things in very closed-source solutions, and for very specific hardware.
This would have been really useful before December.
Read our sidebar r/learnpython
lxml supports CSS selectors too
I’m interested in multiprocessing a few different scripts. Some are data collection and some are radio communications, but they both need to be operating constantly. And the communications script needs to be able to send and receive information from the data collection script. I have absolutely no idea what the best system is for this.
A set can't contain duplicates and has o(1) lookups on whether an item is in it. AFAIK it doesn't maintain input order, unlike a list 
You can buy strip-lights which look effectively identical to the Hue ones, and are completely controllable in the way you describe. It'll take more tinkering in micro-controller-land to get what you want, though. There are a few common "models" of these lights - WS2801, WS2811 and WS2812. The 2801s are generally brighter and have faster response times, but they're also more expensive. You'd also need a board to control them with (arduino, Raspberry Pi etc). If you've not tinkered with this stuff before, you may just want to look at Adafruit's stuff -- they have a well-supported Python environment for working with their in-house hardware, with specific drivers for their "Neopixel" line of LED lights (which includes various lengths/densities of WS2812 leds, as well as other shapes like rings). You can get LEDs cheaper from random manufacturers on Amazon, Digikey, Sparkfun etc, but Adafruit's drivers and tutorials are usually top-notch. 1m 60-led Neopixel strip: [https://www.adafruit.com/product/1461?length=1](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1461?length=1) Cheaper near-equivalent on Amazon: [https://www.amazon.com/CHINLY-Individually-Addressable-Waterproof-waterproof/dp/B01LSF4QDM/](https://www.amazon.com/CHINLY-Individually-Addressable-Waterproof-waterproof/dp/B01LSF4QDM/) &amp;#x200B; Adafruit's 'circuitpython': [https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython) Circuitpython Neopixel driver: [https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit\_CircuitPython\_NeoPixel](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_NeoPixel) &amp;#x200B; This may all be much more work than you're willing to put in, but microcontroller-tinkering can be fun. I'm happy to provide further advice if this interests you, although--full disclosure--all my experiments with ws2\* lights to date have been in the c-based Arduino native language, rather than Python. (I'm also not affiliated with Adafruit, just a happy customer).
Just to add on to the helpful advice, I would say regular expressions are important as well
That was a nice introduction, looking forward to Part 2. Didn‘t know about RestPlus yet. Looks kinda similar to Flask-RESTful. Is this a fork?
As a sysadmin? * Directory traversal &amp; creation * **SAFE** Path manipulation * Data extraction (loading files or data streams) * Data transformation (to json, CSV, xml, proprietary file types) * Data export (save locally or call to an API or other type of endpoint) * Packaging these tools to be able to be deployed in an automated fashion (cx_freeze &amp; rpm + puppet for me)
I work as a sysadmin and use python regularly. I interact with APIs, mainly GitHub, AWS, and Google. 
Holy shit
i just started the book, sorry
You don't need PIP to build Egg/Wheel package. You need setuptools, but I'm sure Anaconda already has it or there is a preferred way to install it there.
Looks nice, functionally! My main suggestions would be around code style rather than the implementation. The only thing I'd say about the way it works is that it would be nice to be able to pass the file path into the constructor rather than hard-coding it inside the class. As per PEP8, methods and variables should be in `snake_case`, arguments should be delimited by comma-space rather than just a comma, and statements like `for`/`if` should have a line break before the code they encapsulate. These things sound like nitpicking, but can you imagine how awesome it would be if everyone's code looked the same? The path of least resistance to that is encouraging developers to follow the official python style guidelines! I'd recommend looking into the `logging` module - that's the correct way to do your `debug_print` method, and it helps out a lot in bigger projects. For mangling paths, I recommend the `pathlib` module. If you can't use that, use `os.path.join`. Try to avoid string concatenation, because it's error-prone and not portable. You have comments explaining what functions are for - that's great! If you put them in a string literal as the first thing in a function, it becomes a docstring, which makes it available to many extremely valuable tools. Something like this: ```python def my_fn(): """Do a thing. This uses the Excellent Algorithm to turn an orange into an apple. """ ... and so on ```

For commercial games, Python's most successful game library is Renpy. Pygame's OK for hobby. But the problem is that we like to use the best tools, and "OK" is not good enough when compared to free commercial grade products like Unity Engine.
It might be a little more than what you're looking for but check out home assistant and the hass.io OS. I run it on a raspberry pi and it talks directly to the Hue system. You can set up basic scripts in python or do more complex stuff in python with a nice add on called AppDaemon. I have a wake up alarm which uses my hue lamp to create an sun rise effect and fade in my favourite internet radio station... I set the timer using my usual android clock and then http post the time to the home assistant system which then triggers the hue at the right time. I also use my hue dimmers to trigger some other cheaper smart switches to sync them with the hue lamps. It's a rad system.

Errno -2 is usually the result of broken DNS or a wrong address. You should double check that the address you have is correct. 
Probably by using requests-HTML to render the content (which is probably using javascript) and then fetch it.
Definitely this! I just started using Chrome’s network monitor, and it’s so cool to see what endpoints a site is using to populate elements on a page. Once you figure out the relevant endpoint, it’s fairly straightforward to access it with the requests library. Do have to be careful about proper access and authorization though.

Python and powershell IT Dev here: programming languages are just tools and some tools are better for some works than others, it's good to keep your toolbox full of tools. That way, when you need a specific tool that works better to do that job, you have the right tools. Python is a pretty good multi purpose language thanks to the huge amount of third party libraries that allow you to do a lot with little code. I believe that (and that is scripting) is a good enough reason to be a language to be learnt by all devs, regardless the jobs each one does. One can automate almost anything in a **good enough** way. At the same time, powershell has a small group of libraries (some third party like PowerCLI made by VMWare and some made my Microsoft like Hyper-V) that work very well and allow you to do almost anything in the IT business with **really** little code (there are things Python can take 10 lines to do that you can do in 2 with powershell). However this is all in the IT business, things like networking, AD management, cloud management, computer set up, etc, if you were not doing this kind of things, powershell would not be that useful.
You can try to look at what you've got currently with something like https://pypi.org/project/modulegraph/ or possibly even https://pycallgraph.readthedocs.io/en/master/ It does sound like it needs a major refactor, though. A sane IDE like PyCharm would be able to help you out there - it has a Refactor -&gt; Move feature which handles all of the imports for you! It's all about minimising your number of entry points. I'd try to keep true constants in a `constants` module associated with whatever they're used by, rather than scattered throughout various scripts. Things which stay largely the same but may need to change between runs can go in a config file - I like TOML as format which strikes the best balance between human-editable and machine-readable (see reasons linked below). https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/#overview-of-file-formats-considered 
Didn’t you hear? Arguments and keyword arguments are advanced concepts now! Time to refactor all my zero argument functions to not use 100% globals, with this new advanced knowledge.
Just learned this for my intro class in my university. Love the language and all it can do. It’s fun to write in, and it’s easier to understand and see the flow of the code. Definitely hope to master this and use it as one of my strengths when I graduate in two years. However, next semester is assembly language programming and C++ courses! Any advice from you Comp Sci geniuses? Best practices? I definitely want to get involved with reddit and these posts, I am new here! 
What patterns did you try?

I think you might want to take a step back and think about what your reasons are for wanting to learn programming. Programming languages are tools, so if you don't have a thing that you want to make (or think you'll want to make in the future) it doesn't make sense to learn the tool. Python is versatile, easy to learn, fast to develop with, and popular. However it's not the most performant, it is difficult to distribute your program, and the state of desktop gui programming in python is abysmal. C++ is highly performant, has a huge variety of libraries available for it, and gives you much finer control over the details of the program. However it's extremely difficult to learn (compared to python), still pretty hard to distribute, and to get up and running with even the simplest of programs will require a lot more work up front. There are many other programming languages you could select depending on what you're trying to do. If you just want to learn SOME programming language for your edification, python will definitely get you a lot of bang for your buck.
For me it’s APIs (requests) working with log files and the like (csvreader / csvDictreader) and IP address manipulation with netaddr that makes up most of my code. 
def stands for "define" - it's how you define a function. It's how you tell Python that you are about to show it how to do a function. But what do you mean "supplier" terms?
Hello! I'm a bot! It looks to me like your post might be better suited for r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. That said, I am a bot and it is hard to tell. I highly recommend posting your question there. Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster. Show /r/learnpython the code you have tried and describe where you are stuck. **[Be sure to format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F)** and include which version of python and what OS you are using. *** ^(this bot is written and managed by /u/IAmKindOfCreative) ^(This bot is currently under development and experiencing changes to improve its usefulness)
`def` (short for define) is the keyword you use to tell Python that you are declaring a *function*. 
I mean simpiler So you mean I could use def like: bob_stone = def print (“reeee”) And then bob stone would print reeee without having to do print
If there's a for loop in a for loop *and the operations in that loop run in constant time O(1)*, THEN you're looking at something quadratic O(n^2)
What functions would I need to define? How would I use it?
Probably, but there's no real error to catch, so why? Unless this is homework, in which case fuck off.
[https://www.w3schools.com/python/python\_functions.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp)
ELI5: You would do what you're trying to do like this: # 'def' and the identifier go here def bob_stone(): # instructions go here print("reeee") print("yo yo yo") print("etc") In programming, a function is something you can **call**. But first, you need to define what they do (the instructions above). That works just like you normal tell a python program what to do. So, a python program might look like this: a = 1 + 2 print(a) This program prints 3. Let's say you wanted to do that same thing in many places through your code- it's easier to give that process a name and just use that name. Especially if it's much longer and more complicated (functions can be hundreds of lines long!) So to turn the above program into a function, we need to *define* the function, give it an *identifier*, and tell it what *instructions* to perform. # define and indentifier def print_three(): #instructions a = 1 + 2 print(a) Now, wherever you need to do that stuff, you can just do this: print_three() This makes it WAY easier to change your code if you ever need to (say for instance, to do something other than print it).
Say you wanted to make a function that takes two numbers and adds them together. You have to name this function so you can call it later, so we could name this function addTwoNumbers. Def is what you use to tell the python "hey, I'm defining a function, whatever comes after the word Def is the name of the function" So it would look like this: def addTwoNumbers (num1, num2) : return num1 + num2
what of?
I recommend it.
I thought it was because it's cold outside in December and water freezes so this wouldn't work.
Yea his docs are really nice 
It's hard for me to see how it would work. From the top of my head I'd say you have to ask kernel to dump you the virtual memory of all processes *or* current state of the physical memory, depending on what you actually want, into your python interpreter process. I admit I'm not the biggest expert, but afaik, you can't do that with pure Python... Secondly, with right encoding, everything is a string. So even if you have the 'magic python script' to dump you all the memory you want to analyse , you'll still need to choose the right encoding to intepret what is a string and what isn't.
What I've learned is that if you are still a noob at guis and/or python in general but have tried tkinter, this will be like magical frosting as you read the docs. But there is still the overhead time needed to learn. It's not like you'll be able to drag drop to completion the first night. You might have to draw your forms out on paper. The overhead time I've experienced with guis isn't just the code. But if you chose raw tkinter the learning curve is so damn steep you might leave your project in disgust. Or, you could find a tkinter snippet that works finefor one of the problems you're trying to accomplish with the gui but you have a hard time trying to expand on it because of the lack of documented examples compared to this. With this documtation, most likely you can find an example to start and then build up.

It was probably upvoted by bots
I'm guessing this post was upvoted by bots.
I mean for non-beginners it is a major selling point. I can build some pretty complicated scripts quickly with it. 
The content is decent and the title is solid. Lord knows I've updated some titles without reading a single comment.
As a beginner, you can think of it as an elegant way to "copy-paste" multiple lines of code. e.g. when you type `def make_coffee(): #some lines of code below` you're basically saying to the Python interpreter "after these lines of code, whenever I say make\_coffee() copy-paste whatever is in `def make_coffee()` to where I say make\_coffee()". It gets slightly more complicated with parameters and return statement, but just try thinking of functions as a template to a complex procedure that you want to do.
Thanks. Enjoyed it. As someone new to Python, I love these types of blogs.
Forget about Python and use C or C++. Don't insist on using Python for everything !

I am an architect on a very large engineering project with 20+ full time devs. Before writing code I design a layout in uml and then as a team we review and adjust it. This allows conflicts to be found ahead of time and corrected and unit tests wrapped around key functionality. Key parts of the system each have a design document. I agree with the other poster that modulegraph is great for seeing what you already have.
For future developments what UML do you recommend using?

&gt; my_path = Path( "C:", "Users", "myself", "Documents", "folder 1", "folder 2", "folder 3", "long named text file.txt" ) I'm all for pathlib, but this looks awful. If you have to hardcode paths in your source files, might as well copy/paste the plain path into a string and let pathlib normalize it (it's not like your C:\ will work on Linux) I would recommend putting things like these into external configuration files, but if it's just a quick script I wouldn't even bother splitting it across lines - PEP8 is just a guideline after all.

I believe the reasons for pythons recent popularity surge is its integration with cloud/aws, as well as popular data wrangling and machine learning frameworks, so learning that side of python is useful. Plus having ability to put flask api on top of logic written in python and deploy it, might be an advantage too.
Great read! Found a sentence you may want to fix: “There might be other resources, or at the very least, you might want to move to move your API away from the root of your app.”
They didn't even iterate over kwargs ideally. \_\_iter\_\_ on a dict yields keys, so iterating over kwargs.keys() is the same as iterating over kwargs, but more verbose...
Not really pythonic, but I use Mint, which is pretty good at classifying your purchases (and also can aggregate purchases across different bank accounts), and I'm pretty sure you can download CSVs from there.
The basic book to start is "Automate the boring stuff with python". It is really great and explain everything in great detail. The book can be obtained freely and legally in PDF, just search it on google and you will find it. You can start there until you feel comfortable and secure about your habilities. If you are interestes with data science it's also important that you feel comfortable with maths also, so go to projecteuler.net and try to solve problems there using python. Hope this helps
That's fair, it was more of a "general best practice" thing rather than "in this particular instance".

You could look into fuzzywuzzy (https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy) which does fuzzy text matching and may help (specifically partial match). I'd make a list of terms for each category then use a loop or list comprehension to figure out which transactions go where (with fuzzywuzzy as a criteria in the loop/comprehension). I think that'd do what you're looking for.

Mechanical engineers Don't Get jobs
Hello, it's actually doable. I've written scripts that used the Twitter API and any logic can be implemented in the back end. These include, checking on select users, accessing tweets that use a specific hashtag or phrase, getting followers/likes of a user and much more
I suspect the first thing you need is test coverage. Go for high value tests that inform you about the structure of your code base, such as compliance with a very high level design. Use your tests to declare the target state and xfail those that are harder to refactor. Overall your tests should inform you how far you are from the target state. Architecture isn't really useful unless it informs change, so it's not too bad to focus on the diff to the target state rather than the total shape of the current system.
It could be possible to do that without the Twitter API?
Mint was easy enough, thank you. Ended up using it to automate the categorization then exported the info in a csv. 
Hey, can you take your already existing swagger file and produce a stub with flask rest plus?
Maybe make a readme so people have some idea what their looking at and ask specific questions where you're having trouble or think something could be improved?
No, the whole point of an API is to provide an abstract interface that enables a program to interact with the application.
I’ve used a ton of diff things, but if you’re a visual learner and enjoy video to teach things, I’d HIGHLY recommend subscribing to a YouTuber called TheNewBoston. He has video series on almost everything you can think of. He has two or three video series on Python, Django and flask. His videos are very good quality and easily digested pieces of information. 
Well, you just suggested using `pip`, which is a bad idea. Building Wheel/Egg is another bad idea, which OP shouldn't do. This is how Anaconda suggests you do it: https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tutorials/build-pkgs.html The Wheel/Egg is a bad idea because Anaconda can do more than `setuptool` or `pip`, like, for example, `conda forge`, so, if you had to run `conda forge` in order to get your program running, there is no easy way to replicate that in `setup.py`, let alone Wheel or Egg.
Oh, he can shoot it though :)

I always wondered how to start improving this kind of "details" (they are not details hah). Thank you very much, I knew about the docstrings but never cared to follow pep8 nor investigate and it certainly is a mistake not to do so. I will clean things up before keeping on and maybe give it the second develop run today. Thank you very much for the feedback! 
Huh? What does that mean? 
This week I started learning Python 😁 I’m still confused, but it was so much easier than I imagined. 
Fantastic writeup! I have an existing flask API that just uses blueprints and you've sold me this library to help better organize and document it. Thanks for the great examples.
&gt; scripts What programming paradigm are you using, if any? Sounds like this could benefit from an OOP refactor. 
Is this true?

I knew stats already. But it’s not crazy deep high level stats. Just basic stats stuff and some linear algebra. 
Thanks :)
Please, read my comment carefully. I suggested adding adding the `requirements.txt` file, that can be used by others. There's no need for OP to run PIP with it. Will Anaconda package work for people not using Anaconda? 
Welcome
Great
Any tips to pickup stats?

Very useful! Thanks for sharing.
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar. Ironic, no?
Should be easily doable. 1. On script that Use Twitter stream API for hashtags etc and account API for get user info. 2. Pipe the twit into redis queue. 3. Another script to pull twits off redis queue and process it according to your logic. This setup allow you 'infinitely' scale to unlimited hashtags or users
Welcome :)
To avoid this kind of error you have to understand the difference between the object and the reference. In the first case array\_1 = \[1,2,3,4,5\] a new object is created and assigned to the name array\_1. g1 holds the reference to the object previously assigned to the name array\_1, not to the new one. In the second case array\_2\[:\] = \[1,2,3,4,5\] no new object is created, instead the object assigned to the name array\_2 is modified in place (cf. the reply of [nathanjell](https://www.reddit.com/user/nathanjell)). Both array\_2 and g2 reference to the the same modified object.

For simple output, standard formatting methods should be sufficient, as already suggested. For more complex things, you may want to try out templating engines like Mako or Jinja. 
You named it "my python stuffs". It sais nothing and suggest a collection of private snippets, so nobody cares. BTW, GitHub is not a review site. Don't expect anyone to rush there and comment your code. It's a platform for code sharing.

Here are a couple of very simple example scripts to show one simple way this could be done without using any multi-threading or multi-processing. Here is the "server" script. The "data" it collects is just timestamps and random numbers, just to give some simple example data to work with: """ Data Collection Script Once started, this script continues running until it is terminated. This is a simple example program to demonstrate basic network communication between two Python programs. This script collects data from an imaginary sensor, and accepts network requests to send out all of the collected data. For the sake of simplicity, this program does not use any multi-threading or multi-processing. Instead, the function to collect_data and the function to accept_network_connection "take turns". This works well if the collect_data function does not take too long to run, and if there are periods of time between data collections when the program can respond to nework connection requests. This system should spend most of its time waiting for a network request from the other program. If the collect_data function is relatively quick, then even if there are network requests received while the collect_data function is running, (and while the function to accept_network_connections funtion is not running) those network requests can still be processed before they time out. On the other hand, if the collect_data function too slow, or needs to be running most of the time, no data will be lost, but network connections may time-out. If that is the case, then a different "push" system might be more apprpriate than this "poll" system. In a push system, this program would initiate a network connection when the collected data was ready to be sent.

ur awesome.... ghostscript is the culprit, somehow it got upgraded to 9.26, i reverted and now everything is normal
I'm not sure what you mean by "IT world". IT is usually understood to be limited to doing software/hardware installations, tech support, network configuration, user management, etc. But then you talk about analytical/mathematical skills and programming or coding. That's not IT. IT: Yes, they will hire anybody. There's a very big need for competent IT people who will stick around. I've never seen an IT department that wasn't overworked, understaffed and "trying to hire someone right now". Software: If you can prove you can do it, they will hire you. I would love to have an engineer for exactly the reasons you give. You'll be competing against software people, though, and there's a lot of them. You'll want to start looking at engineering companies and playing up the "double threat" angle. Most humans will tell you a portfolio is more convincing, but some places have strict rules about needing documented education.
Dude you are awesome! Thank you so much :)
Welcome :) 
Thanx to the dynamic typing, otherwise I would never know why debugger needed ever.
Type hinting is for IDE not for compiler/interpreter.
In my experience there's no place for engineers in the "IT World" when it comes to classic jobs like programmer or network engineer there's just a giant lack of knowledge. I guess there are some engineers that have the programming or administration skills but it's hard (source: i am an engineer and i'd consider myself a very good programmer compared to most engineers i know - but someone who studied all the details of a programming language will beat me a 100% of the time and my administration knowledge is zero). But there's companies that actively look for engineers with decent programming skills. And I had really good experiences with applications to those companies, i never had to show any certificates or even a programming test. Just some talks about my programming projects and past experiences and since i have some source code on github i can usually just point to that and i try to add anything to my projects that looks good on an application (unit tests, version management, trying to use modern language features, implementing basic functions myself instead of using libraries, ...) my smaller projects have a ridiculous size just because of that. But i can say i worked with X which is nice and most of those things are basically just copy and paste from my project template.

This is a really great resource. Thanks for sharing this with us.
I think there is a small error in the example ```Python class Point: def __init__(self, x: float, y: float, z: float = 0.0): self.x = x self.y = y self.z = 0 def __repr__(self): return f"Point(x={self.x}, y={self.y}, z={self.z})" def __eq__(self, other): if other.__class__ is self.__class__: return (self.x, self.y, self.z) == (other.x, other.y, other.z) return NotImplemented # __ne__, __lt__, __le__, __gt__, __ge__ are also generated! p = Point(1.5, 2.5) print(p) ``` The line `self.z = 0` should be `self.z = z`

Put descriptions in readme file, submit your site for free to google - that way people can find your code through google when they are looking for something similar 
Instead of calling function from different modules (os, os.opath, stdlib) with string argument, create Path object and call its methods. Create child path using slash operator '/'. from pathlib import Path d = Path('C:/', 'test') d.mkdir() f = 'file.py' p = d / f with p.open('w') as file: file.write('print("Hello, world")')
Thank you, I’ll try this !
yes chief
What is your simulator simulating?
I’d guess it’s because it has not been officially implemented in CPython yet. Looks like it’s in PR: https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/10497
Check out Monte Carlo simulation on Wikipedia or something. It's a way to approximate pi

You should always use the Twitter API and check the TOC because I think that there are some limits regarding the number of requests.
I haven't looked at all of them, aren't most of these examples in MATPLOTLIB's gallery page?
Holy shit, this is great!
Reporting for duty. 
As others have noted, depends on the task. If you work with databases, which 90%+ of jobs will require you to interact with, use APIs related to databases like pyodbc, turbodbc, or sqlalchemy. Which also means, you should definitely learn SQL.
Use something like this: https://pypi.org/project/pygrok/ For more complex things I recommends tools like logstash.

As technicians?
You need to set the right path to your python interpreters. If I remember it correct it should be somewhere like Settings -&gt; Project Interpreters -&gt; Python Interpreters. To find out the correct path you can just use this in command line: `type python` (or `type python3`).

We just released a new version of Wallaroo, our scalable stream processing system for Python, on Friday. We'd love to get feedback on it! &amp;#x200B; [https://github.com/WallarooLabs/wallaroo/releases/tag/0.6.0](https://github.com/WallarooLabs/wallaroo/releases/tag/0.6.0)
That's the problem I would like to bypass. Because e.g. if I try to refresh a user's page many times after a while Twitter blocks the feed.
I thought that could be programmed a series of 'user bot' that cycle through the refresh stages
Thanks!
No module named ‘cartopy’ means you don't have cartopy library. If you're using Anaconda install it with: conda install -c conda-forge cartopy
Copy the files over and install them. Mostly, you can just go to pypi and search.
Nice! Final point on docstrings - you can put them on modules as well! So that comment at the top describing what the file does can also be in `"""` and it'll be accessible to anyone who imports it.
Great Work. Thanks!
I know. It's a way to approximate many things, so you can use it as a simulation technique in future projects as well. 
This is gonna be such a time saver!!
You don't need to refresh a user's feed 100 times per minute
&gt; Please, read my comment carefully. I suggested adding the requirements.txt Yes, specifically you wrote: &gt; that can be used in command **pip** install -r requirements.txt Do you see **pip** there? I hope you do. So, specifically, what you suggested to do is a bad advice, and OP should not follow it. You simply don't know the subject and suggested at random, hoping that it will work the same way as it works with PyPA utilities, but, surprise, it doesn't. &gt; Will Anaconda package work for people not using Anaconda? Will distributing your code in Java work for people who can only use Python? What is the point of your question? OP indicated that they use Anaconda. It's a different distribution, with different packaging, different rules apply. If OP wants to distribute their program s.t. it works with Anaconda, then whether people not using Anaconda will be able to use it is of no interest.
I worked on this and I’d be happy to talk about Wallaroo or stream processing if anyone has any questions.

I'm quite new to Python, but I just created a Christmas-themed Mad Lib. I am going to try changing the color of the inputted words.
Welcome :)
Here's what you can do: 1. Use a very similar machine to your server environment (same version of Python, same length of machine word, etc.). This machine needs to have internet access. 2. On this machine, create a virtual environment and install everything you need. 3. Copy your virtual environment to your server. 4. You may have to patch few things in the files generated by virtual environment, but maybe it will just work out of the box. If fixing those things becomes too complex, you may be more lucky creating a genuinely new virtual environment on your server and only copying the contents of `lib` from your old virtual environment over to the new one.
Why is this feature controversial?
Any half decent Camera will work. The key is to create a good model which can easily detect the students
Another good question is why the PEP was approved even when most of the core maintainer response seemed to be negative toward it. 
Good language design doesn't mean add any feature that seems like a good idea. Python became what it is today because features were added with care over time. More than a few of the new python3 features are extremely controversial _because_ they've not been vetted well. And at this point, Python is big enough to have collected both people with wisdom to know better and people who perceive stagnation as a lack of progress rather than a period of incubation.
Done! That's a nice little feature there, thanks again.
Classes too, come to think of it! Although there are differences in opinion on whether the class definition or the `def __init__(self)` should get the docstring explaining what the class does. 
The fact that this guide is necessary is why I gave up on using Colab.
I have created [Game Of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in pygame. [Here is a link my repo](https://github.com/kubapilch/Game-of-Life) if someone want to play it, just install pygame and run [`game.py`](https://game.py). Firstly you place your "alive" cells with your mouse and when you are ready press SPACE to start the game. To modify cell size and number of cells in a column/row open `game.py` and change `size` and `amount` values. &amp;#x200B; Also can someone rate my code? I have started writing in python recently and I want to improve my skills.
**Conway's Game of Life** The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced players, by creating patterns with particular properties. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
&gt; that can be used in command pip install -r requirements.txt "by others" was implied. As I said, there's no need for OP to run this command. &gt; What is the point of your question? My point is, if that's a Python code, then it can be used on any Python distribution, not only Anaconda. Other distributions cope well with pip and wheel. OP was asking about distributing code to other people.
I was wondering that. Anyways I'll change the module docstring and add one to the class when other classes come into play, there is more to come as soon as i get my ~~shit~~ chores and tasklists done.
I agree with this. However, I will say that I hate using pythons logging library. \`getLogger\`? Seriously? Am I writing Java here?
I do this often since I work on an air-gap network. For pure-python libraries, this works well. It can get a bit wonky when things get compiles such as cython, but that is to be expected. I often find myself manually installing them on both machines and then using the environment. For the most part, python make dependencies easy but it makes it harder when there isn't access
Oh man, I forgot all about this. Yeah, AFAIR, everything that claims to offer async file io in python is doing threads under the hood and faking async.
Because I think viewers should be aware: 5 days ago OP posted [Python Network Programming - TCP/IP Socket Programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/a16p58/python_network_programming_tcpip_socket/). This was pointed out to be a ripoff of thenewboston's course. OP then used alt accounts, /u/moist_opinion and /u/yashjaisw, to try to defend themselves. OP has since deleted those comments but you can see them [here on Removeddit](http://removeddit.com/r/Python/comments/a16p58/python_network_programming_tcpip_socket/). The mods removed the post shortly afterwords. While I'm not sure if this is as blatant a ripoff as OP's last post I did some quick looking and this playlist has some similarities to, surprise, [thenewboston's Django Tutorials for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBlmzzFcLgDhKTTfNLfX1IK) playlist, and possibly this playlist as well: [Idea Landing Page -- Build a place to Test Your Ideas with Django](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEsfXFp6DpzTgDieSvwKL3CakR8XyKkBk).
So what's actually wrong with it, that you feel vetting failed?
Have you looked into Django Rest Framework? It has millions of dollars in funding for it's development
Great to see you forming your opinions without watching or seeing the code. But I removed the post anyways. Congrats. 
Strange that you would remove the post since you're implying my comment is incorrect 🤔
I deleted it because I am tired of people shitting on me without reason. I am done helping people out. Every set of videos takes 30 days to make and you have no idea how much effort and discipline it takes to come home tired af but still make a video. Here is the link - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhTjy8cBISEpXc-yjjSW90NgNyPYe7c9_ If you find any similarities feel free to post it on Reddit saying I am scammer who steals work of other people. I am done.
Implement some kind of deduplication for file storage.
&gt; I am tired of people shitting on me without reason I stated my reasons pretty clearly. &gt; you have no idea how much effort and discipline it takes to come home tired af but still make a video. No reason to assume that about me. &gt; If you find any similarities feel free to post it on Reddit saying I am scammer who steals work of other people. I am done. I didn't say you were a scammer did I? I pointed out things that happened in your last post. Such as the fact that you use alts to try to give yourself legitimacy.
Yeah shouldn't have made the alts. Idiotic move. 
I'd personally love this. I just started my first full-time job as a dev. Was proficient in js but learning python for my job. &amp;#x200B; Saving for reference.
Glad that you can look back at it and learn from it. Honestly it was the thing that took away the most credibility. It would have been way more effective to just reply to the top comment in the last post and, assuming it's not an episode for episode copy, try to talk about the differences between the series and any differences in your approach to the topic. 
True.
I think it's a fantastic idea, especially if you don't just burn through them by knowing the answer, but by doing them as you would if you are learning them. Look at documentation, how to approach algorithms, breaking things down, and (gasp!) unit testing, if the medium allows
I am making an Internet Data Usage/Tracker App. &amp;#x200B; It will calculate usage throughout all Internet usage, either it being through a browser or through downloading... it does not matter, it will be similar to the ones that metered internet companies give out to calculate how much you used to not go over... But instead of updating once a year like some of em out there it will update twice a minute. I plan on making it work on the background of your PC (In the Hidden Icons tab) so you will forget it is there but still works. You can set what your internet allows in data and when you reach 50, 75, 80, 90 and 100 percent usage it will remind you to not go over but obviously at 100 percent it will tell you that you went over. It will also state how much bandwidth you are currently outputting and receiving (In Mb/s and or Gb/s).
Oh! How do you mean? Sound interesting!
VS code can handle all of the languages you're using (I believe) if you're looking for a one stop shop solution. I have used both Pycharm and VS code for python, and like them both. VS code can feel clunky at times for me however. 
if you can learn C++ in 21 days, what stop you to learn python before 2019??? 
&gt; Python became what it is today because features were added with care over time dataclasses appear to be an example of an addition to python that has seen little use.
Requests is great until this happens: for request in requ... ARGH! I'm not sure if I should change my variable naming scheme, or `import requests as requests_lib`

What kind of subtle Kenneth Reitz dick suck is this? Go has a perfectly sane http library with a similar API to requests. While it's named net/http it is far better than Python's http client library.
Well, for me... Visual Studio is my first IDE so I am pretty used to it by now, I never used PyCharm and like Eclipse but think I may still like Visual Studio more (Kinda a close match). I started with C++ about two or so years ago then went to Java --&gt; JavaScript --&gt; Python and now doing some, very little but some C#. I did at the beginning find Visual Studio clunky, especially since Eclipse is more straightforward along with Code::Blocks (Since I use it as well for C++ (Forgot to Mention that)) 
I am however currently downloading all the languages that Visual Studio offers since I may just use it and junk the others (Besides maybe Eclipse, I like Eclipse to much to just junk). I think its C#, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, F (F something not sure what never used) and a few others... A good bit of em I have not used, but downloading anyway.
Nice library, but the versioning scheme just seems strange.
Other than setting CookieJar for you, what does requests do for sessions that net/http doesn't? The latter has pooled/keepalive connections out of the box even using the default client. The only thing that really annoys me about the net/http client is not having an easy way to create a useful error out of unexpected HTTP status codes, and requests is also not good at this -- raise_for_status has to be explicitly called and it also doesn't handle every non-200 status.
&gt;there isn't really such a thing in many operating systems where Python runs (for instance, Linux). Correct me if I'm wrong, but here it is, in Linux, since some years ago [http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/aio.7.html](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/aio.7.html)
For starters, Go's http.Client doesn't persist headers. Only the cookie jar. You can also not access the cookiejar from the client object so you have to pass redundant data around your functions if you need to access the cookie jar between requests to modify request headers. This makes it a chore to manage headers between requests for certain APIs I interact with. Requests' session objects are *much* more powerful and produce much more concise and readable code. I'm not sure who Kennith Reitz is but I'm guessing he's the maintainer of Requests? Not sure how praising a project is "dick sucking" but there was nothing subtle about my praise. I can't figure out why this is such a slight for you. All I said is that Requests makes HTTP request handling way easier for my use cases. I also specifically said the Go http package isn't bad. Don't take it so personally.

Nice. Could you post screenshots? This project reminds me of [PygCurse](http://inventwithpython.com/pygcurse/), which adds a curses-like rectangle for adding text to Pygame games.
I would say [steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography), but I believe there should be an easier way.
From another comment: &gt; For starters, Go's http.Client doesn't persist headers. Only the cookie jar. You can also not access the cookiejar from the client object so you have to pass redundant data around your functions if you need to access the cookie jar between requests to modify request headers. This makes it a chore to manage headers between requests for certain APIs I interact with. Requests' session objects are much more powerful and produce much more concise and readable code. The Go http package feels like it's more geared towards HTTP serving rather than using as a client. There are other little subtle things that are built into Requests that I haven't reproduced in Go yet, like modifying request objects dynamically using hooks. I'm sure there's a way to handle similar functionality but it seems like it's going to take writing a wrapper function for http.NewRequest and http.Client.Do. That being, a lot more code than just using hooks on a request.
If using Anaconda, one can get packages offline using `conda install &lt;package_name_on_computer_disk.tar.bz&gt;` To install packages downloaded from the repo, for [example to get numpy](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/numpy/files) I am pretty sure you can do the same with pip
We've just released 1.1.0 which includes this change!
Forgot how good ridge plots look! Bookmarking this for sure for a resource next time I'm stuck trying to figure out what I should try next.
We've just released 1.1.0 which includes this change! Thanks for your input!
&gt; For starters, Go's http.Client doesn't persist headers. Are you really complaining about an *extremely* simple wrap around the client to keep hold and persist headers across requests? Most uses of Python requests don't persist headers either, only use in Sessions. And clients are not sessions. The idea of Sessions are indeed nice though. &gt; You can also not access the cookiejar from the client object so you have to pass redundant data around your functions if you need to access the cookie jar between requests to modify request headers. This makes it a chore to manage headers between requests for certain APIs I interact with Unless I'm severely misunderstanding the documentation, cookie jars are attributes on the client struct. So you should be able to access them *just fine*. &gt; Requests' session objects are *much* more powerful and produce much more concise and readable code. And *this* statement is valid and true. But you're complaining then on a lack of the concept of an http session, not a lack of the entire requests networking library. &gt; The Go http package feels like it's more geared towards HTTP serving rather than using as a client. As are the majority of stdlib http packages. But it still is just fine *making* requests. &gt; I'm not sure who Kennith Reitz is but I'm guessing he's the maintainer of Requests? Not sure how praising a project is "dick sucking" but there was nothing subtle about my praise. I can't figure out why this is such a slight for you. All I said is that Requests makes HTTP request handling way easier for my use cases. I also specifically said the Go http package isn't bad. Don't take it so personally. He's the author and I assume he still is the maintainer. It's not a slight for me, it's just that over the past few months especially so after his pipenv-based meltdown on this subreddit there have been people making propaganda of "oh look how amazing &lt;package of his&gt; is", and then this post blindly praising all of requests, without explaining clearly what about (it seems to be just Sessions), seems to be more of such propoganda.
&gt; it also doesn’t handle every non-200 status Curious, any examples? Worth noting that 30X redirects are considered successful requests so they shouldn’t trigger an exception when `raise_for_statud()` is called. 
FYI, OP. /u/data_analist is talking about [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (text/code editor). And I believe you are talking about Visual Studio (IDE). Though I've never used it, the consensus is that PyCharm is the best Python IDE available. Alternatively, you also have the option to use a code/text editor (+ plugins) to develop Python. Such as Sublime Text or Visual Studio Code (which is becoming one of the most used).
Python crash course by eric matthes. Its great for learning and comes with 3 projects for you to do aswell as small assingments after each lesson. 
100% disagree. Go's standard library is a) better than requests b) built into the language, not a separate module. Plus because requests uses exceptions, in the wild you'll see people do stuff like calling requests.get without doing a try/except, which leads to 500s in production. I wish that were just an example of sloppy coding, but I've seen multiple people who I consider to be good developers make that mistake. It sucks.
&gt; And clients are not sessions. The idea of Sessions are indeed nice though. Yes. They are. Hence the post. I'm not sure why this required paragraphs to get to. &gt; Unless I'm severely misunderstanding the documentation, cookie jars are attributes on the client struct. So you should be able to access them just fine. That's entirely possible. Like I said I'm new to Go and right now saving clients to disk for persistence is a higher priority for me. &gt; It's not a slight for me, it's just that over the past few months especially so after his pipenv-based meltdown on this subreddit there have been people making propaganda of "oh look how amazing &lt;package of his&gt; is", and then this post blindly praising all of requests, without explaining clearly what about (it seems to be just Sessions), seems to be more of such propoganda. This is called a conspiracy theory. People have been praising requests all over reddit, SO, Google forums, etc since before I got into Python. That's why I started using it, because someone went on about how useful it was. Just like I am now. Not everything is some clandestine operation to push things that you don't like. And since you think this is some crazy /r/hailcorporate style conspiracy to spread propaganda for a FOSS project (which is a hilarious notion to me), I don't think there's any more value in continuing this thread of conversation. It just looks silly.
Python requests has been a standard module for years. 
Yeah, just let it fail silently, it's better /s
For starters, go is the last language you'd go to for any kind of productivity. If you're going to compare HTTP libraries, find one in a decent language instead of a purposefully crippled one.
&gt; Plus because requests uses exceptions, in the wild you'll see people do stuff like calling requests.get without doing a try/except, which leads to 500s in production. I wish that were just an example of sloppy coding, but I've seen multiple people who I consider to be good developers make that mistake. That's probably because it's *good* practice. You needed to contact some external service, and that failed - that's a 500. Unless you're building in some automatic retries or something, in which case you're going to put that in the exception handler. Silent errors are an absolute killer.
That’s why we read sidebars.

Correction, Python, a bit like JS, is spoiled for libraries all round, both have monolithic amounts compared to most other languages.
So... one very big one?
Well aren't you the all knowing Oracle..

No `urllib.request` has been. `requests` is a distinct library: it's just so good that it should be used by anyone thinking of using `urllib.request`.
Go developers love bad practices, they use a language that makes the function call syntax be `if err, res := function(); err != nil {` `return err, nil` `}` Just so the compiler doesn't have to implement exception handling.
That does not work, friend. The median has to be a value in the original dataset. You would have to create extra rows = to the weight of each original row. And then take the median of this new table.
I lol’ed
&gt; which leads to 500s in production. As opposed to what, exactly? If, as an example, my web service uses the Reddit API to gather some data, process the data, and present it (for instance, that user analyzer site), and the Reddit API doesn't serve me any data (because it's in maintenance or just down), what exactly is my service supposed to do besides serve a 502/504? Make up data and serve that instead? If there's a cached version, perhaps the correct answer is to serve that cached version, but that's not always the correct answer, and you won't always have a cached version. &gt; I wish that were just an example of sloppy coding, but I've seen multiple people who I consider to be good developers make that mistake Noisy failures are, in general, far better than silent failures. Obviously not failing is the ideal, but if you're reliant on an external system over which you have no control, it's far better to fail noisily - it usually produces log results that let you investigate what exactly happened and if something you did was to blame, and you'll also usually get users contacting you for help.
I hate you ,😂
urllib is in the standard library, requests is not.
There isn't really a good reason to use requests over urllib.request, besides the already known API since everyone used it in python 2.
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DVDLGXkVoAAUkjT.jpg
You'd have to use a compiler such as Py2Exe. There are others, do a quick google search. I have no idea what the best ones are.
Pyinstaller is what you want 
Too complicated,my brother told me how you do it in C+ and I looked for the python way of it
Screw requests, `net/http` has been completely fine for everything I've done. Lets talk about serialization of JSON (or anything, for that matter) into structs and how having to write a struct for anything you plan on serializing into a `go` object is tedious. I love go a lot but holy shit am I not a fan of having to write out cooky nested structs for JSON.
Go is the last language I'd think of for doing exploratory programming and custom data types.
&gt; Lets talk about serialization of JSON (or anything, for that matter) into structs and how having to write a struct for anything you plan on serializing into a go object is tedious. I love go a lot but holy shit am I not a fan of having to write out cooky nested structs for JSON. This is my second complaint. I have a huge list of API endpoints to interact with and the company isn't exactly consistent with the output. It's also an undocumented API. You can see where this is going...
Not true. Critical security vulnerabilities are patched and shipped same day in requests, but not in standard library modules. This is *too important* of a module to be included in the standard library.
"*I am* the Senate" \- Guido, probably
Sure! I'm at school right now, I'll add some screenshots to the README when I get home :)
Yes of course. But what made Guido decide that was the hill to die on? It's been a while, and I grew tired of reading python-committers because of the discussion around that PEP. Still I recall it as Guido made a half-hearted defense of the proposal at best. 
I'm not trying to derail this into a gO nEeDs GeNerIcS but it feels awfully dangerous and outright "lol I give up" when you have interface fields with type assertion/reflection shit going on, but that's just me. &gt; inconsistent return values &gt; undocumented API I'll be honest, I almost always prototype something in python + requests to explore the returns for stuff like this and then start writing structs. I really love both languages. Generally my determining factor for if I want to pick python or go for a project is "how many platforms will this have to be distributed to and will humans be using it?". If the answer is "at all" I generally tend to reach for go. I know there's ways to statically compile python and I've done that for a few things, but go is extremely handy for distribution. 
Would be great idea 
It's not only lists that can be slow, and it depends on what you're doing with it. Anything that involves linear search or copying lots of data is generally slow. Looking up stuff in a set or in a dict, is O(1) and practically instantaneous in contrast. Sets and dicts are made precisely for this
That's exactly why I'm learning Go. I have some projects that could benefit hugely from more portability. Luckily this undocumented API was fairly well documented by me while writing the original Python version so it's not too bad, but I still have to write god damn pages of structs to handle the responses which I'm not looking forward to. They're also nested so it's going to be a circular mess of structs referencing other structs which I don't like the thought of.
There are some tools that exist to build structs from json schemas (and I think there's some XML and maybe CSV stuff even too) that I've played with and had OK luck with, but in the end I still end up having to tinker a fair bit. I suppose the other part of this is that serialization is very easily unit tested and the standard go testing framework is pretty nice.
Thanks. I'll poke around to see what I can find to make it a little less painless.
Please just do it in C# , don't torture yourself.
Name it `response`, `result` or something like that
thank you good sir.

Ok, that's a good reason. I was thinking about functionality, not logistics.
If anybody is willing to pay for Python teaching materials, they haven't looked hard enough online. Save yourself the effort and and tell them to look at 6.0001/2 on MIT's Open CourseWare.
I don't think the OP's problem relates to generics. Java has generics and arbitrary JSON is still ridiculous there, as well.
It's not about the lack of online resources. It's about tailor-made notebooks based on their curriculum which they can directly use to teach their students. Plus, its good money man xD &amp;#x200B; P.S: MIT OCW 6.0001 was my intro to python course, easily one of the best I've taken online.
In my experience, implicitly passing on a 500 code is not what you want to do. At a minimum, a log of the event should be generated, and if there's something that can be done to fill the request as a stop-gap so the application can continue running, allowing the user to complete their work, that should be done. And it's entirely possible that you do still return a 500 of some sort, but it would be a 500 wxplicitly defined by you, not happenstance.
My first thought, use headless chrome. Not rendering the ui should make everything faster. You could also look at directly sending the form post, rather than browsing to the page and using webdriver to populate it. That might hit a csrf or xss error though.
Maybe there was other drama leading to that and he just wanted an excuse to leave
Add your license in the project and in each source. Nothing stopping anyone from coy paste. Sell without warranty. Let them come back for more/ better versions. 
Yep agreed would be a great idea especially for us noobs. 
The python requests library is something I thank everyday when I wake up.
You dont want to use vscode for java though. Youd want preferably intelij but could use something like eclipse like he is using.
Dear friend You're on a very good path on PMing. PMs usually earn more and do less brain-intensive work. That's what you'll hear from a typical developer like me :D There are a lot of free "Introduction to CS" "Learning Coding in 2 hrs" -ish bootcamps. Watch a few of them. You need to understand the concepts of how modern Tech work: what is Front-End, how it's different from Back-End. Why you should not make an Android app on C++ (or why you should ???). For me Wikipedia was enough, but I'd advise to use some videos.
Now everything can be pirated. You don't sell DS stuff, you "provide services". You get what I mean ?
I take it you've never used either, then. Yes, `requests` doesn't add any functionality over `urllib`, technically. Anything you can do in requests, you can do with urllib. But that's an asinine reason to dismiss a library. Anything you can do in python, you can do in C. Or indeed, in brainfuck, or assembly. Why don't people just do that, then? Because python is ergonomic, because APIs matter, and because "syntactic sugar" is the very reason that all programming languages exist.
Static typing is a plague upon humanity. You spend half your time in a statically typed language trying to code around the static typing (interfaces, class hierarchies, generics, etc.).
So I recently needed to do a bunch of GET requests concurrently and couldn’t figure out how to do it with Python so I wrote it in Go. Pretty much need to make a GET request and save the status code and url in an array. How can I do this with Requests? My understanding is that I can’t use Requests because it doesn’t support asyncio or is this wrong? Anyways I like Python but it sucks compared to Go at doing stuff concurrently imo. 
I just started playing with the [Visual Studio Code PlantUML plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml); it looks promising. 
It's like the monolith from 2001: A Space Odyssey, but it looks less like a black slab and more like Guido. 
For some reason in this sub you get downvoted if you say anything bad about another language or anything positive about Python.

This has the faint smell of an XY problem. Where did you get these hex numbers from? If it represents text, there is probably a better way to fix all this.
&gt;Silent errors are an absolute killer. Silent error Unholy error All is calm When there should be terror Silently round my decimals? Coerce my types? That's not helpful! Holy cripes! Fail early and fail fast Or as a developer you'll never last
Depending on what it is you want to do, may I suggest looking at [Pyro4](https://pyro4.readthedocs.io/) . It almost fully abstracts away the network communication and allows you to write programs that talk to each other over the network, via normal Python method calls.
I recently switched from net/http to [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) and found it to be better intuitive and similar to Python's requests library.
Sure, yes, you don't want to return the Apache default 50X page. And in general you should be returning either a 502 or 504 as appropriate, not passing on the code of the service that failed; I didn't mean to imply otherwise. 
1. Requests is synchronous, this is a complete deal breaker. Something like Tornado's AsyncHTTPClient is a better comparison. 2. When using Go, you're typically focused on things that are a little closer to the metal, which by design means a little more code. 3. I think some of the things that you're upset with are just a direct result of static typing.
Technically that's not true. There's some module in the standard library now that uses requests, then when some of us got the bright idea of importing requests they masked the module. You can still get to it, but not easily. I complained bitterly but the module author gave a lecture about it wouldn't be the latest version and could have bugs in it, etc. 
Look into the threadpool stuff. [Multiprocess Library](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/multiprocessing.html?highlight=process).
If there were a critical security vulnerability in python it would/should be patched as soon as possible.

Yeah, but then how long would it take to run the Python release cycle? And then for package maintainers for various systems to ship the update? It's much faster to just push your updated library to PyPI and anyone who cares has it immediately.

This is some damn fine content.
I had a very similar feeling while learning Dart
I don't use VSCode, I use Visual Studio IDE... Visual Studio 2017.
Thanks for the insights. I have seen PM jobs that ask for more programming background. Recently in an interview they asked about simplifying code so just trying to figure out how to move forward.
Ok thanks
Well, I will use Visual Studio 2017 and PyCharm then for Python and Visual Studio 2017 for the rest of my coding.
Don't want to seem sceptic, but putting technical responsibilities on Management staff us not a good idea, and usually a sign of unhealthy processes. At least judging on my experience. Go with management. 
You can't use dictionaries/hashes/maps/whatever it's called in go?
Well you can stay eclipse for java anyway. But if you really like pycharm, id sugest using intelij (somewhat the same editor but specialized in java instead of python).
There are [discussions to make error handling less verbose in Go 2](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/go2draft-error-handling-overview.md), though. (I like Go, but also don't understand why this if-error-return is better than exceptions.)
I used both in different situations, and the APIs aren't strictly better or worse, but just show different design decisions. Requests is easier to just fetch something quickly without thinking too much, while urllib gives more control and structure at the cost of being slightly more verbose. None is less "ergonomic" than the other.
What about the stream API? 
Nothing unexpected, really. For some reason, Go has a fan-base among Python programmers, despite being the exact opposite of the design philosophies of Python.
If they add exceptions and a proper type system, it might be usable, but will still be decades behind modern C++ and Rust in language design.
Dataclasses are just a copy of the widely used `attrs` library, albeit with some changes to ease maintainence in the stdlib - and added because the core devs wanted to use them *in* the stdlib! 
Have you tried https://github.com/levigross/grequests 
From my point of view... and using python on server and desktop (pyqt).. U can get things done. In a day one can knockup a whole interface, REST server and client, and get "onto's" client desktop or online (both via git) very fast. The pain and hassle, particular on desktop c++ etc makes it easy... Refactoring is easy, and segfaults etc dont crash whole app leaving u confused as to why where etc.. There is a performance penalty, not noticable "in normal usage", and indeed most of the newer apps and some older ones, and being migrated to golang, as it it's statically typed.... 
Background: I need to run a script in a VM and for some reason it does not worked. I have confirmed that it works on my local machine. 
Most people who are choosing to use Python for such projects (and that also have experience using something like Java) are doing so because they've realized that static typing's benefits don't outweigh the "quickness" of Python development until you have very large code bases, very large teams, and very long development timeframes. As an aside, look into mypy and PEP-484 which bring static typing to python. Not as expressive a type system as you get in some languages, but it's OK.
I'm guessing you haven't used any beyond C and Java. Static types in a language with good type design are friends that make your job easier and faster. 
PyCharm is really good. But then VS is fine. It really comes down to how much it bothers you to switch IDEs. I'd recommend just trying PyCharm for awhile.
What's your return rate?
Thanks for this! Didn't know about this.
I looked at the source and it looks like the session function is just a wrapper for http.Client so doesn't persist request headers.
Dynamic typing can be useful, but it also (IMHO) tends to reinforce bad habits and allows you to embrace anti-patterns. 
Oh dear! The nightmares, it’s all coming back! 
https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/blob/master/README.rst Could be what your looking for?
&gt;https://github.com/levigross/grequests [https://mholt.github.io/json-to-go/](https://mholt.github.io/json-to-go/) ftw &amp;#x200B;
I was on a bit of hiatus with python and when I came back I wrote a script that made a simple web call using urllib. The CR had only one comment: "use requests". Changed my world, man.
I tried to add dots to my boxplot like this today. Turned out to be a poor choice with 384,000+ data points...
I am fully on the PyCharm bandwagon. I have been using for the last 4 or so years. I love it and I don’t have a reason to change at the moment. I have heard very good things about VS Code but I haven’t personally used it. Another thing about PyCharm is that it is built on the same system as IntelliJ which I also use because I don’t like Eclipse...
Fake news. Java anti-patterns are incredibly numerous and notorious (as evidenced by the number of books published about them). The "bad" habits associated with dynamic typing (well, duck-typing in Python) in Python is due to cargo-culting by other people writing tutorials, courses, etc. "Properly" writing in the way Python types is first and foremost EAFP and secondly, using Composition instead of Inheritance. The former pattern takes advantage of runtime check typing to _enforce_ the object's protocol and the latter _defines_ the supported protocol. It's a different way of thinking, basically you're thinking inside-out instead of outside-in. People who understand category theory should find duck typing "natural".
Thanks. Will add all of these into my notebook snippets.

Where is LOG being defined? I only see log. 
Derp, fixed with edit. Ty!
`interface{}` for everything
I’m probably just bad at duck typing in general but for things like serializing unknown objects (JSON responses, sometimes) how do you handle typing of the field values? Maybe they’re int, string, bool, object, or list; would you type check the fields before moving along? If I’m remembering my duck typing reading you would maybe check for attributes that infer the type without explicitly calling a `type()` on them?

Here's one example of building a weighted average function that you can apply to data as you group it. This may help but I'm not 100% sure about your use case. [http://pbpython.com/weighted-average.html](http://pbpython.com/weighted-average.html)
500 is "internal server error", while the 400 series is for "bad requests". Any valid, well-formed HTTP request whose *content* is gibberish could probably result in a 500 error, but what qualifies as garbage content depends on your server. If it's only designed to accept text, for example, but receives a zero byte, that could return 500.
Side note, this is not *really* a python question, but a genetic networking question; any answers you get will not depend on the language you're programming in
It's only accepting text. So, you are saying that if what I receive is empty (meaning no file name is given) I'll return 500 and not 404? Do you have any other example? Thanks.
First sub I had in mind since I'm using python. What sub is general for these things?
That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying if one of the "characters" of the text string is not a printable ASCII character, for instance the zero byte, then return 500. An empty string is still text; a string with a zero byte in it is, by definition, not text. 
I actually don't know the answer to that question, I bet it's something like r/HTTP
Today I had to add springboot as a test scoped dep to a Java EE project so I could perform some http requests, because Jersey doesn't work without a DI container like jboss or a lot of undocumented work. Except I wanted to just get raw json, so I had to dissect the RestTemplate class (what a great name...) to figure out how to do a request manually, then construct a json parser, then parse the response body. It took about 3 hours to figure out how to do the equivalent of import requests requests.get(url).json() 
Im confused The client is Google, and all you can do is type whatever from the keyboard to the search function after 127.0.0.1/ How can you put the zero byte in there?
Hold on, Google is your *client*, meaning Google starts the conversation with your application? I get the feeling you don't fundamentally understand what you're trying to do, and at this point *I* certainly don't. What is your objective? 
If you find me on Discord, AKossler#5848, I'm happy to help you live. Using reddit for this is tedious
Writing an HTTP server I communicate with the browser (after 127.0.0.1/ I for example type the name of a give file to get me there so I had to handle that in the code. Also gotta do a redirection file example etc Did everything except that error 500 thing, cause I dont understand when I'm supposed to do that
Sounds like the perfect candidate for abstraction and make a requests similar API for Go. 
OK, here's the simple answer: you don't *need* to use a web browser, you can connect from the terminal or any random application and send whatever bytes you want to the server
Im afraid it's not supposed to be that "complicated". I'm supposed to only use the browser. 
I feel the opposite. Unless you’re just passing on unknown content (it happens but not often), you expect your JSON to be formatted a certain way. Go structs make it super easy to validate your assumptions and Matt Holt’s page (linked in the other comment) makes it super easy to write a struct based on sample data. 
You can. 
There’s a difference between 500 and 504. In any event, the programmer should make a decision about the proper response, not let errors bubble up. A well behaved Django app should never throw a 500.

Go encourages noisy failures because you have to do if err != nil everywhere. 
Pip uses requests, I know. I’m not sure about other standard packages. 
Using OS threads for HTTP requests is very resource inefficient.

I actually liked using it last summer for processing a JSON API. I had to do a lot of painful scaffolding at first to unpack the data, but it all paid off on the other side because I had a proper separation of concerns and could make changes easily later in the project. Also writing the scaffolding helped me internalize the data model, so I knew what the fields were. 
Seriously! Half the praise for requests on that thread amount to little more than "I'm used to doing it this way, therefore it's better", yet everyone is completely ignoring this part that shows what a poor fit Go can be with something like JSON. That said I have plenty of friction when using py for serialization too, especially around character encoding. I feel like py's entire mo is to confuse familiarity for simplicity, but maybe that's just me.

In your case Pygame might be a good choice to start with. https://www.pygame.org/ or if you want something more sophisticated, Tkinter might be an option https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter For something like a game i still recommend pygame. 
It does. The Session struct is a wrapper around the http.Client, *and* contains a RequestOptions object, which contains the persisted headers.
You might change your mind after working on larger code-based with more people. 
I doubt exceptions will be added. IIRC, it goes against Google's style guide to use exceptions in Java and C++, which is one reason for the lack of exceptions in Go.
The first variable in a class method doesn't need to be `self`, that's just a convention. You can replace it with the more Spanish `se`.
There's no module in the standard library that can use requests unless it is vendored, because requests itself isn't in the standard library. If it's vendored, getting to it would be 1-2 lines maximum.
Ah, in some web browsers you can insert a zero byte by having %00 in the address bar, so you could test with that
\`moneyshot\`
 from gevent import monkey monkey.patch_all() import gevent import requests def get(url): res = requests.get(url) results.append((url, res.status_code)) greenlets = [] results = [] for url in urls: gl = gevent.spawn(get, url) greenlets.append(gl) gevent.joinall(greenlets) Wrote this on my phone so might have errors, but roughly that should work fine. 
Interesting to know what aspects of Python you find detract from stability of result. Do you mean specifically dynamic types?
The maintainer of net/http, /u/bradfitz, has been working on an experimental new http client library for go. It was temporarily made public and removed when people noticed, but someone forked it before it went down. [https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/a0rzvh/bradfitzexphttpclient\_experimental\_new\_http/eakl0ma](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/a0rzvh/bradfitzexphttpclient_experimental_new_http/eakl0ma) Hopefully he'll see this thread and solve these problems in the new lib.

Neat. I'll take a closer look.
Your comment makes perfect sense to me, except the “at all” part... might you mean [eat al.](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/et%20al.)
This is awesome and looks like something I'd like to contribute to. Thanks.
That was my thought. Plenty of cases where you don't want to raise anything not 2xx
What's wrong with checking the value of the status code from the response in Go?
But the request is the thing you send to get the response or result.
&gt; Building my first python gui with pyqt4. Dude, same! I'm the lead developer for my high school (underwater ROV) robotics team, and we're experimenting with using PyQt4 for our GUI (which takes in images processed by an computer vision-processed class) &amp;#x200B; I'm finding it really difficult, however, to implement widgets for visually displaying orientation data from our gyroscope onto the GUI, so push comes to shove, we'll be visually displaying it, as text, somewhere on the interface. 
I've actually been working with a lot of functional programming and Haskell in my free time recently. I've been hearing about functional programming for years, but its only been until recently where I've installed Haskell onto my system and began playing around with it. &amp;#x200B; I think most of us (Python) developers here have a narrow definition of what modular, easy-to-debug programming is (OOP), but Haskell is really teaching me to think about programming in a more mathematical sense, which is super cool
Are you on Linux/Windows/Mac? Was pip3 already working, but just returned that error when you were installing PyQt5? 
Is there a reason you want to use python for this? Like do you want it to help you get better at python as an exercise? If not, it might be worth checking out something like Unity and learning some C# (OOP and not difficult to get on to if you've already got some Python). It's much more powerful for game development than something like pygame and looks after quite a bit of the behind the scenes stuff.
This is really clever, lol

VS Code only handles C# if you're using .NET Core. No Winforms for you!
I am using Windows. This is my first time using pip at all. So I am not sure!
Yeah! This was exactly my thought. Too many resources out there are either write ups, which walk through the concept, or videos which jump directly to the solution, or cut to the end of the video.
I'm not a professional Python programmer mysel f (at least not right now), but it's the best language for this style of programming imo.
If you have Python3 installed: Download the [get-pip.py](https://get-pip.py) file from [https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) Run \`python3 get-pip.py\` You should now be able to either run the \`pip install\` or \`pip3 install\` commands and proceed in your installation
You shouldn't learn python for Drupal. You should learn python data visualisation and possibly even some basic machine learning. It will help you directly with reporting and indirectly by improving your communication skills with technical staff. As an aside, don't be the person who relies on technical staff to get data out of systems to ad hoc reports that meet your KPIs and not theirs - that's not what they're most efficient at. It's great if they can help you improve your processes but if you own the pipeline you'll be more productive and more respected. The automate the boring stuff with python is a good place to start. Generating a CSV you can drop into excel should be your level, and the next tier up would be a dashboard with plotly's Dash framework.
Thanks - I’m not learning python for drupal though! I am looking to leave my company soon and want to build skill set
It’s really true. `net/http` (if you’re familiar enough with go) is extremely easy to do all the easy things you do with `requests`. It is of course different for many reasons but it’s idiomatic with go so it doesn’t feel strange to use. And I completely agree with encoding. Decades ago now when I was first learning about python, and generally using a computer for anything other than porn and video games this really threw me for a loop. These days it doesn’t feel too bad very often except when something is encoded in an unknown-to-you encoding. That’s always not fun or interesting.
That's not true. OP is referring to HTTP error codes. which dont change based on what language you're using to interact with a server. 
Sorry - what I was trying to convey was “any of these options” - so kinda et al, but really just bad English on my part.
No well accepted ORM is another thing ...
One of the two hardest problems in computer science. 
So unfortunately this didn't work. I successfully ran the file. But I am still getting the same error.
You successfully ran **python3 get-pip.py** ? &amp;#x200B;
When you say VS you mean VS Studio 2017 or VS Code? I use VS Studio and Eclipse the most, PyCharm I will check out though.
Well, I will for sure check out PyCharm then!
Alright I'll see what happens, ima get PyCharm now!
&gt;python3 get-pip.py No sorry, I successfully ran the file you told me to download. "[get-pip.py](https://get-pip.py)". I then tried to run `pip3 install pyqt5` with the same error as before, realizing I skipped a step, went back and ran `python3 get-pip.py` . getting the same error though: `'python3' is not recognized as an internal or external command,` `operable program or batch file.`
It reinstalled pip 18.x is what the file did.
Ah, if `'python3' is not recognized as an internal or external command` is the error, then it must be a problem with your Python installation yourself. Since you're using Windows, my guess is that Python isn't in your PATH environment variable. &amp;#x200B; Check what version of Python you installed, and add its according location under C:\\ . For example, if you installed Python3.4, you'd add `C:\Python34.` There are 100% more detailed explanations on how to do this, here's an example: &amp;#x200B; [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3701646/how-to-add-to-the-pythonpath-in-windows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3701646/how-to-add-to-the-pythonpath-in-windows)
You can, but a map has to have the key value types predefined. So mixing types in keys and values is not possible. There's no generics either

GoLang is 9 years old, Python is 28. I'm sure that with Go's popularity and corporate backing it will catch up in terms of built-ins and 3rd party libs (unfortunately). I'm biased, I'd much prefer Python became faster/more efficient or even compiled if it has to be, but money moves things quickly. Go's come a long way in under a decade.

I think a lot of Python programmers know C, and Go's "close enough". Plus, they are both highly opinionated languages.
I generally find it easier to use two different languages for that. Transform it in Python and send it Go.
&gt; Not as expressive a type system as you get in some languages, but it's OK. But, amusingly, more expressive than Java's and C#'s. Less expressive than most functional languages and those that support varying levels of dependent types.

brb adding to standard library &amp;#x200B;
It has a gigantic library ecosystem, mature web frameworks, a repl, fast to write, easy to read, lots of deployment options, supported by every clous/paas provider, optional typing...given that youtube and instagram were both built on python I'm not sure that you need to worry about being able to build an 'enterprise system' with it (by which I assume you mean 'a complex app built by a large team at scale').
Great idea, saved for reference

&gt; A well behaved Django app should never throw a 500. Theoretically, but that ignores the reality of most software development, in tracking down every single possible exception is a huge time sink and often effectively impossible. Unless of course you're talking about having a generic try-catch at the outer layers, but how does that help anything?
Hi poothebear0, The cultural aspects are very important and powerful - if done right. However, this typically takes time is the hardest part of baking security into the dev process. Baking tools into your CI is typically a good place to start, because you can get some visibility of security issues in your code base. With that visibility, you can then prioritize what issues you should prioritize with the team and what practices need to be improved to address the common issues. There are a few free/open-source tools that you can start using today. Generally, there are three security tool categories that you want to cover: 1. **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Detects security issues in your code. \- [Bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit) \- [Pyt](https://github.com/python-security/pyt) 2. **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Detects insecure libraries/dependencies in your requirements.txt: \- [Safety](https://github.com/pyupio/safety) 3. **Secret Management:** Identifies Hard-Coded Secrets in your code-base \- [detect-secrets](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets) There are a few challenges with using tools individually though, let me know if need any additional pointers. Finally, there are other tools that try to make that process of embedding different security tools easy. * [Salus](https://github.com/coinbase/salus): This is from the coinbase team. * [GuardRails](https://www.guardrails.io/): This is a GitHub app that is currently beta. Full disclosure, I'm the co-founder of GuardRails. Hope that's helpful. Cheers, Stefan

Excessive convolution is usually a sign that you haven't found the commonality between components and exploited it. Stop worrying about toolsets, most will just add complication. 
&gt; More than a few of the new python3 features are extremely controversial because they've not been vetted well. Such as?
Google is your friend. 
Part of it is that you simply can't do something like SQLAlchemy in Go - or any other compiled language - without using code generation. The Go ORMs I've seen are best avoided for anything non-trivial (eg. where you want a proper multiple table join, not some horrible N+1 query pattern).
it depends on what do you want with the JSON. Unmarshalling it into a struct serves as a concrete contract and a validation layer--however tedious. Though, if you really don't care that much of all of JSON fields, you can unmarshall it into a map and parse out the field(s) you want. (i do this lazily as i'm only interested in a one field in the response body, the others will just redirect them back). But yeah, it was super cool doing that in python.

Linux asynchronous I/O has been announced in 2.7 kernel IIRC, but it never worked. There are two reasons to it: there are many modes of performing I/O and for some of them the underlying API should change to work. For instance, pass-through (O_DIRECT) needs the drivers handling I/O to be able to perform that asynchronously, and that would depend on a file-system being used. But with more common buffered / write-back I/O there's a problem too. Certain things down the line may block instead of returning EAGAIN or a similar error. Here's a good write-up about the problems and what the future holds: https://lwn.net/Articles/724198/ To me it seems like the patch mentioned in the article will never make it in, and instead Linux might just keep working on polling I/O... but what do I know... it's been a problem long enough that a lot of people rolled out their own solutions and work-arounds they came to depend on. Lots of commercial products invested a lot of effort into working around this problem, and the problem keeps growing... Maybe next major kernel version? Maybe Linux will get a fundamental redesign? Maybe people will give up on POSIX standards and will put the idea to rest... who knows.

Well there's not professional and there's noobs. I'm a network engineer just stumbling into Python so it would be good to see someone else's approach to coding.

I'm wondering if there are other fun ideas I could add to this project.Hoping for your suggestions!
You still have to type the map on instantiation. E.g.; `m := make(map[string]string)` Or I guess you could do like `mi := make(map[string]interface)` But then you're still stuck doing type assertion, so it's not like you freely get to throw things into a map like you can a dictionary in python (or another non-strongly typed language).
Exactly, and exceptions make implementing the strategy straightforward and clutter-free. errors should be handled where it makes sense to handle them, not necessarily where they occur

create looping gifs
aren't these gifs looping?
Try a different approach: don't spawn processes for each of your devices but only a few (like, if you do computation intensive stuff, spawn as many processes as your cpu cores) and feed them with data using a queue, then read results in your main thread. This thing is called a consumer-producer pattern. It seems you have limited amount of devices (couple of hundreds), so you could try `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`. Anyways, the idea is that don't try to share memory (`manager.dict()`), but send data to processes and read return values later in the main process. It will be easier.

Several people have tried already, and it hasn’t worked so well. `requests` is very Pythonic, and I’m not sure if a direct translation is the right fit for Go.
Great advice!
Please give me answer..!
neat
Yeah and it did work, so that problem is solved! But it seems that the spotify API does not like something :/ seems like it handles the redirect uri differently...
Yes this will be difficult but you could learn a lot in the process. My advice is to start small and focus on one specific thing at a time. Seems like you have a lot of features lined up for what you're trying to do...try to take it in small chunks. Some of the best-written python3 code I've seen has been on financial trading repositories, and there are many in active development by really qualified quants. If you become overwhelmed I recommend tagging along on some of these repos, fixing issues or writing documentation for the maintainers. You'll learn a lot working side-by-side with them instead of languishing alone on your codebase.
Is there a way to handle redirect_uri's through Travis ci?
Do you know such an example pattern? If there is I will add that to the example list.
This subreddit is not for Python development help. Go to r/learnpython for Python questions. FYI the way you asked the question won't give you any answers. You need to be more specific. What kind of chatbox? Is it a website or a local application? Is it between employees, between clients, or between clients and employees? What kind of chatbox do you want? What is its purpose? You can't just ask for a "chatbox" and expect people to understand what you mean. Also, if you're running a company and advertise it as "this Best Python development Company", your programmers should at least be able to implement a chatbox. Also the picture of code on your website is not Python.

You need Python 3 and pip for that. If you already have them, try running 'pip' instead of 'pip3' and make sure pip binary is located in one of the directories listed in $PATH environment variable. If it's not, you can run it by typing the full path to EXE. Sorry, I don't know what is the typical installation path on Windows, but I am sure you can find it, for example with file search. 
Great work

I think the OP is referring to some high level features that were present in the requests python lib, and would also be present in 3rd party Go libs. That being said, Go has a production grade http std library (you can run it in production without sitting behind an nginx, uwsgi, etc) 
Looks like a scam to me. In the sense that he made someone create a website about python just googling what python is but not truly understanding it. It looks amateur at best.
There are a lot good stuff. You can start with documentation, youtube channels, you can use sites like codeacademy, sololearn, datacamp. You can also buy yourself a book, like the one written by Mark Lutz. I think it's up to you, what you prefere. Most important thing is to find your way, and learn. 
Buy a paper book about programming in Python for beginners and learn. Write lots of code, even if it does stupid things. 
# Competitive Costing
I don't care if you're doing web stuff or not or even if you use python. Read the Requests API docs anyway just for inspiration on API design. Probably more helpful than a lot of programming blogs are. Hardly anyone has an interface that high level that still gives access to all the features, and a reasonable level of control over some of the details of implementation should you need it. It's an impressive library.
I care
Haha suprisingly not, I just have quite a favouring for stupidly long words.
Just a question, since you like Eclipse, haven't you considered using PyDev (http://www.pydev.org/) in Eclipse for Python? If you have and it didn't suit your needs, I'd be interested in knowing what happened -- as I'm the PyDev author ;)
Thanks, that is literally what I said. 
What should requests use besides exceptions? A 500 is an unusual condition, and if you get that, you don't want to just keep running the normal code path. Any kind of recovery from that is application-specific, so the user has to handle it explicitly no matter what don't they? How could Go get around that? An exception tries to ensure that the error message matches the point where the code actually fails rather than ten lines later when garbage data is used, and it prevents someone's cute error message that happens to contain a keyword from triggering someone's crappy if statement that looks for a certain word and treats it as a command.
Super cool! can we make the same thing with an image?
Is there any free ones If so can you send a link
That is just straight up dope AF!
Useless, yet beautiful. You earned my star
Here is link to documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/ Online courses (most of them are at least partially free, enough to learn basiscs): https://www.datacamp.com/ https://www.codecademy.com/ https://www.sololearn.com/ As for books, used paper ones, but always there is: https://linux.die.net/diveintopython/html/ 
Yes :) with OpenCV 
Thanks :D
Requests is basically a knock of Perl's LWP library.
amazing work bro

Hey. I’m currently working on a similar project (also for university). How did you go with the Kalman. What is the final result, did you use the Kalman filter? If not, what did you use instead? Thanks!
Veeery Nice ! Maybe not the best demo of it, but pretty cool to me. How many hours (approx) did it take you to make this ?
A weekend to build the first functional release and all the week refactoring and improving the readme :) I'm thinking in new features like allow to export the ascii to bash for share with someone.
Awesome, keep rocking !
When I got your message I read it over and yeah it probably doesn't haha.
`import * from *`
Actually thelibrary is a single function that accepts **kwargs and does every conceivable thing.
Don't use reddit to do your homework.

ThreadPool from multithreading is more appropriate.
requests **is** very convenient, but if you are doing a simple HTTP request in a script then I would argue that not introducing additional dependencies, i.e. using standard library, might be better. It depends on the case of course.
Asyncio is a thing in Python now, so you don’t need an OS thread. 
Very cool. Can it export to animated gif?
Imagine watching Matrix on this :)
what's crazy is that some dude made this 17 years ago (aalib). don't know how he made it work with those old computers
For me, your pool code did work and produce the same output as the other code. I'm currently on Windows. My guess is that you're on another platform that uses another start method [1], and that `pool.join` doesn't work as expected with the `fork` start method. Like /u/slapec, I would suggest trying `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`. It's a newer multiprocessing pool implementation in the standard library than `multiprocessing.pool`, and might be more likely to give you the results you're expecting. 1: See [Contexts and start methods](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/multiprocessing.html#contexts-and-start-methods) in the multiprocessing documentation.
I had not thought about a gif, it's not a bad idea, I thought I'd allow to export in a .sh to share the experience in the terminal
Yeah for the scope of the script it was probably overkill but finding out about it in the first place proved far more valuable.
thank you for answer

Doing self training for Python. I really want to start an online business something out of it like those brilliant people who created Instagram, Dropbox and others. I’m a beginner so it will take a lot of time but I won’t give up. I have trouble finding books and online tutorials/training that discuss in-depth learning of Python like not just the how to code but everything that it has to offer. I might find that later so I’m still focusing on finishing the training. I’ve been doing this for more than 2 weeks now in total. It would be great if someone would be willing to educate me or help me in this business I’m planning on but I don’t know if I can afford to pay you. Thank you in advance.
There was also some shaders you could enable for your graphics card (think it was ATI specific) to render games/stuff in ASCII, that was about 17 years ago (2001/2002) when they launched the Radeon stuff - can't remember the exact details - it's been a while.
I love vscode. I recently partitioned my harddisk between Linux and Windows, and prefer Linux, and vscode is able to be installed on a Linux machine. Very light-weight, nice add-ons, excellent support and very versatile. Plus, stupid easy to open into a project via terminal. &amp;#x200B; With vscode you can combine all of your coding into it. You would just need a way to compile the C++ code (idk about Java, not experienced in it).
Thank you. I put the code on my linux box and it worked. I was testing everything on the online ide [repl.it](https://repl.it) because I was too lazy to login to my linux server. I can't believe I wasted two days on this when it was working all along. 
I tried using a queue but I didn't see an example on using key: value to add data to the queue. If you see from the example the function f produces key value pairs and adds them to the manager.dict. What is the equivalent of doing it with the queue? I want to add the values from the queue to a dictionary once everything is processed.
It was kind of an experiment with selenium automation in the first place moreover you cant use that api now since facebook discountinued the user publish permission in that api :) look it up
I made something like this, except it used 2 colours per character https://gfycat.com/idolizedsomegemsbuck
I am up for Free Python Automation Chores Including web scraping and Pc automation just hit me up and ill do it
There is warning in the `multiprocessing` documentation that pools don't work from the REPL, so that was probably the problem then. `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` uses the regular `multiprocessing.Process` under the hood, so you can still use `Manager.dict` with it. The main reason I suggested switching to it is that it is a more lightweight process pool implementation that is less likely to behave weird than the older `multiprocessing.pool`, but since the latter is now working for you, I wouldn't consider that a priority.
Visual Studio. (Though VS Code is pretty good in the vein of text-editors-you-glom-plugins-onto-to-make-them-into-an-IDE)

give some more context in to your problem are these rows just simple text or are these variables?? or are the indivisual values variables? and btw yes its possible it will be something like : for (variable) in ( name of your list): if (var1//ion element == var2//lat element): continue//skip printing that row.
Hey, you should try switching "python3" to "py" at the beginning of your statement. For some reason on my computer the command "py" calls python 3.7.0 (my current version) without the need to specify which one I want. 
I couldnt agree more but judging from what you are saying looks like you might have potatoe pc because python automation with selenium doesnt take too much horsepower its basically like browsing the web but still headless is always better make sure you add proper time intervals in between 
Been working on my toy language project, Akilang, using Python and LLVM: [https://github.com/syegulalp/Akilang](https://github.com/syegulalp/Akilang) The whole thing's basically an experiment to see how much of a language, and to what degree of success, I can implement by way of those tools. Python gets big props for being easy to develop in, if not with the fastest runtime. But most of the real heavy lifting is done in LLVM anyway, so the real roadblock right now is my understanding (or lack thereof) of language implementation. The biggest recent obstacle was a problem with the underpinnings for how types work in the language, so I backed up and restructured some things. It's still deeply imperfect, but I'm slowly getting a handle on it, and now things like being able to box/unbox variables in a generic container work okay. (Being able to do this is a big step.) If you're on Windows, you can pull and try out Akilang right now, with some demos (e.g., Conway's Game Of Life). I also have a "Robots"/"Chase" game demo, now playable. (Plans are on the table for supporting Linux; I'm just trying to focus on one problem at a time right now.) There's also a short demo movie (slightly dated now): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vZ4oFCFOl8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vZ4oFCFOl8)

Its not.
Add () after copy
 resp, ok = requests.get(url) if not ok: # handle resp.error That's a better API because it forces the user to think about the fact that network connections die all the time, and there should be a plan for what to do about it. I'm not a zealot about this. Database calls can also die, but I don't think returning `ok` is very useful in that case because there's not likely to be anything to do when the DB is down beyond throwing up an error screen. But HTTP calls die regularly and predictably and there's no reason to pretend otherwise.

There _is_ a generic try/catch at the outer layer. That's what sends the 500 response. Let's put it this way, any time a Django app throws a 500, it's a bug. Can your Django app achieve zero bugs? Probably not, but it's the ideal, and things that cause you to write more bugs are bad.
Yes. Python is great for so many things, but games really isn't one of them. If OP wants to start learning how to make games, why start with a language that's subpar for doing so and then have to switch later on?
The FAQ at /r/LearnProgramming is a great place to start.

&gt;I want to make a simple chess application The title start with "**I want to make a simple chess application"** in /r/python, we talk about a cheese game, not 3d games. I agree Unity is a great full game engine, but when you want to build a simply cheese game it's to heavy. Mosts of cheeses games online use directly DOM (not canvas), and DOM is slow, but is fast enough to build this kind of apps/games. You use a bulldozer to break a simple one brick ?
The trouble there is you can just ignore the status code parameter, and then you get garbage data, which might be written straight to a file or something. Lint will tell you, but... you can ignore that too. You can also mishandle it by only handling specific error codes. What would be really cool is a special metadata attribute that indicated the function was highly likely to fail, which the compiler would yell about if you didn't handle.
this is my homework. I have to search for code. Wherever I can find. No restrictions
Try it on this file: __import__('subprocess').call('poweroff')
I think you need to obfuscate it better

&gt;Though I've never used it, the consensus is that PyCharm is the best Python IDE available. I'm usually halfway done with a commit by the time PyCharm even loads. It's so slow and sluggish with everything that I much prefer VS Code. PyCharm is basically like taking a 40 foot long motorhome down to the corner store to pick up a gallon of milk instead of driving a Honda Accord. I mean, sure, you've got a lot more 'features', but the Accord has everything you need and gets the job done a fuck of a lot faster.

People will go to any length to get subscribers on their channel these days.
I agree with you but it's important to distinguish that Java has a lot of issues due to its strict OOP enforcement and inheritance. Static typing isn't the pain point. 
No man... People share their work !!! People only subscribe when they find the shared work useful. 
You have a very valid concern. I have been extensively using Python for around two years now and of late due to the increase on the scale which my stack aims to operate at I'm finally having to stop from just finding the Pythonic solution for the problem at hand. Python indeed has a major performance shortcoming and a high memory footprint. The latter also applies to Java to some extent especially on smaller servers which I use where the overhead of JVM is quite big. Also Java's GC is not the most memory-friendly imo. Python is an excellent language and very good for prototyping and in all those situations where performance and static type checking is not a necessity. However there's a certain elegance to the solution which statically compiled languages provide and I have begun to appreciate it more and more. But imo a very large range of problems in software development can be solved by just using Python at first and extending it with C at places which are slowing down the app. Though in domains like web dev where there using C or C++ is not practical I think there's a good case to be made that a framework like Java's Spring makes more sense than something like Django if performance is an issue. And another thing as a CS undergrad that matters to me is that you need to be good at one of C++ or Java in order to be employable in a large range of organizations. I know Python, C, Rust and Golang but at so many coding tests recruiters ask questions as if assuming candidates to know at least one of C++ and Java.
I would recommend reading the book Black Hat Python. The author mentions spawning a reverse iirc. You will also learn a lot of other goodies in the book which you should enjoy.
Sounds like he's closing out duplicates 
the workflow is generally equivalent to unmarshalling json into map[string]interface{} instead of a struct, but it doesn't complain that you're not type asserting each field you try to access first. this means that you're generally using exception handling to catch KeyError and TypeError when the data doesn't line up with your expectations. this isn't necessarily better but i think the divide in thought is that people rather just handle json in this dynamic fashion where generally it'll be fine and if it blows up, they can go back to it and add exception handling or default logic to handle situations where data expectations aren't consistent. the overhead of defining exactly what you're expecting in Go can be overwhelming. I think it's akin to sql/nosql preferences where there are people who rather not deal with defining and normalizing their data model upfront, but are OK dealing with the data discrepancies at runtime . other people are OK with doing so since it makes certain issues impossible, eliminates need for a lot of the runtime error handling, and general protection against developer errors. 
First thing first - `(m in prime or m%i!=0 for i in prime)` means: &amp;#x200B; &gt;for each `i` in `prime` check if m is in prime or if m is not divided by i. &amp;#x200B; In other words - it's parsed as `((m in prime or m%i!=0) for i in prime)`. &amp;#x200B; Lets focus on the generator expression part - `(m%i!=0) for i in prime`. This is not a boolean value - its a "list" (generator, actually, for the sake of the explanation it's a (lazy) list). So, if m is 6, the list is `False, False, True, True`. &amp;#x200B; But... you need a **single** boolean value to decide if you do the \_then\_ block of the `if` statement. So how do you turn these 4 booleans into a single boolean? You usually want a quantifier - either `any` or `all`: &amp;#x200B; `any` returns `True` if there is at least one truish value. So `any([True, False])` is `True`. `all` returns `True` if all the values are truish. So `all([True, False])` is `False`. &amp;#x200B; In your case, I don't know what you are trying to achieve, but since you are checking if the number is a known prime or not divided by known primes, I assume you want `all` \- as in "*undivided by all known primes*" or "*no known prime can divide it*". So you probably want: &amp;#x200B; if m in prime or all(m%i!=0 for i in prime): &amp;#x200B;
Which I why I asked *why* OP wants to do this. If they just want a fun python project to help them learn python, sure play around with pygame. But if they're actually interested in learning how to make a game, or see themselves wanting to expand on that skill in the future, why not use a better tool? Unity2D is great for all kinds of simpler games, it's not just used for big 3D physics-heavy games. Really without knowing more about what OP is interested in its hard to say what would be the best way. If they do want to use python and don't see themselves wanting to make other games, then making it in something like tkinter or even pyqt would be better to gain useful gui dev skills. Pygame in itself isn't that useful of a thing, imho.
Try throwing this question over on r/learnpython you’ll get more visibility. 
His about first sorting by file size. Next use some OCR library on all files with the same size and compare the output (probably mostly gibberish but good enough to compare). Now just delete the duplicates. The first step should reduce the computation time as OCRing each file might take a while.
You should really mention what exact version of CPython you're running, and where you got it from. I've had your code running on Arch for ~10 minutes with no segfaults in sight.
Wouldn't that put me in a position where two completely different drawings could be the same file size? Thus miss flagging it as a duplicate?
Thank you, will do!
With a DB based on Objects, not Documents.
Hot dayum! Fine work!!
Useless? That's what they said about Penicillin!
Thanks for the modification. I really appreciate. I have published your comment on our site. And will keep in mind to maintain the Python standard. Thank you very much
I did. This is 3.6.7 32 bit
very awesome tutorial and explanation of code
What platform? Where did you get the binaries from?
Generate a md5 hash non-inclusive of file names ... Delete the duplicates?
The chance of parts/assemblies having the same file size while being different is slim, almost impossible. You can get the filesize in bytes while your files are &gt; 1MB or 1000000 bytes. You could also extract data from the header of the SLDDRW file. This might tell you the creation timestamp or other things that you can filter. 
So long as they're actually identical. One byte out of place and you'll miss it!
Yes, is posible, but the challenge is to achieve synchrony, I’m working on it 
do you plan on doing a video with selenium or requests library to get thru a login/authentication. ive followed a few tutorials but I still have trouble with that. 
&gt; Parse and validate *a subset of* YAML YAML, as a format, is fundamentally broken, like INI and Markdown. StrictYAML is to YAML what Commonmark is to markdown - an attempt to fix a commonly used format which in so doing is a new format, which few will make efforts to use compared to the existing, bad, format. This is a single library, used by one language. It's not enough to fix the YAML ecosystem. Don't get me wrong, I applaud this. Plenty of shops want to use something which looks a lot like YAML, and if they're going to do that, I would prefer they converged on a safe, unambiguous subset. However, I'd probably prefer them to just switch to something simple and safe by design, like TOML.
OP is referring specifically to HTTP client functionality. As has been discussed in other parts of the thread, the http package is not *bad* but the mixing of client and server functionality in the same library with methods that do different things based on context seems to hold it back. You're talking about service functionality specifically, which Go is very very good at as it well documented all over the web. Requests is an HTTP *client* library specifically.
I'll take you up on the offer.
it's in the docstring, but this is occurring on ubuntu 16.04 on kernel 4.17 with 4Gib of memory. RAM usage has little effect on what integer causes the fault, and it came from the jonathanf ppa.
Have you tried running it on a different computer, preferably with identical software? My guess here would be bad RAM. 
Interesting. What would be a good size difference to check within. For example: if the file is within 5 bytes of file2 then flag it. Instead of 5 bytes what would be a good number there.
Yeah timestamps will for sure be different, but i could probably take the string and break it apart until I found something that was a for sure win to check with. I'll have to look into it.

Segfault can also mean faulty hardware. This signal is often triggered when CPU is overheating and when running on a börken RAM. 
Update: left it running for just over an hour in a loop, not a single segfault. Something is definitely off here.

I created a small library to simulate Java-like interfaces in Python: [https://github.com/tyleragreen/python-interfaces](https://github.com/tyleragreen/python-interfaces) Here's the idea: class Iterable: def be_iterable(self): pass @interface(Iterable) class Foo: def __init__(self): pass # raises InterfaceException
You know what would be cool? A definition of non-classical logic.
Very very cool. Well done

What’s wrong with YAML? I’ve used it in the past and liked it.
No problem, sorry if it came off harsh. For more on python style guidelines look at [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) (though recall it's a generic guideline): &gt; Always surround these binary operators with a single space on either side: assignment (=), augmented assignment (+=, -= etc.), comparisons (==, &lt;, &gt;, !=, &lt;&gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, in, not in, is, is not), Booleans (and, or, not). and &gt;Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability. &gt;Variable names follow the same convention as function names. &gt; mixedCase is allowed only in contexts where that's already the prevailing style (e.g. threading.py), to retain backwards compatibility.

Yeah, one of the nice things about python's hashlib is that you can pass in a file a few bytes at a time, which means you can skip the first X bytes, if you know they'll be the headers which might be different, and just focus on the meat of the file.

Thank you but even with (apparently) installing anaconda I'm getting 'Conda' is not recognised. Tried the pip installer and even that's throwing errors about the GEOS VERSION. I hate giving up on something like this but am I doing something seriously wrong? 
The spec is 80 pages long and fully implementing the spec includes allowing your config file to execute arbitrary code. Actually, strictYAML's website gives a great overview of [some of YAML's bad features](https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/features-removed/). Another good source is the [PEP which decided to use TOML for python's future packaging infrastructure](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/#other-file-formats).
A better way is to hash bang the file: #!/usr/bin/env python print('hello world') If I save that as `hello_world.py`. Just using `hello_world.py` in CMD or PowerShell will run the script correctly. It will also run on Linux and MacOS.

Use ocrmypdf for OCR. Pytesseract is for image to OCR PDF not PDF to OCR PDF.
&gt; As an aside, part deux, unit testing also chips away at the advantages static typing brings to the table which pushes the point where static typing outweighs Python advantages further away. This is worded weird but I think you're saying python requires many more unit tests around type checking than a statically typed language and as a result some of the quickness of python is lost when testing is considered? 
Yes, dynamic types. Objects and variables not having defined types really scares me. Also, as weird as it sounds, the lack of verbosity bothers me.
Exactly! When I graduated and knew a bit of Java and JavaScript, I used to hate Java's verbosity and complexity. However, as I worked with it, I grew to actually love it. So much so that I prefer using GWT instead of plain old HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend. The piece of mind I get from using it is incomparable.
Exactly the same attack because the dangerous code is an expression, not a statement, so it will run even if you put it inside parenthesis. If it was a statement, BTW, `eval` would have refused to run it. 
Hi, here is simple definition from wikipedia: Non-classical logics (and sometimes alternative logics) are formal systems that differ in a significant way from standard logical systems such as propositional and predicate logic. There are several ways in which this is done, including by way of extensions, deviations, and variations. The aim of these departures is to make it possible to construct different models of logical consequence and logical truth.[

figure out how much identical files with different names differ in terms of lines in the output of diff. Then, write your script to running diff on all pairs in the folder, redirect to some common logfile, and count lines. If the logfile length is within some Delta of identical file diff length, mark it for follow up.

There's RQ, flask-rq, flask-redis, flask-rq2, celery.... so many. Do you recommend any single one of them?
If you really want to stick with redis then use the flask version since it'll make it easier for you. Honestly, I like rabbitmq with pika for such tasks.
I would certainly say so. I also found that it faults several times at 20140 after both rebooting and not using python for about 30 minutes.

Working on a python "function as a service" framework as a Firefox Webextension. The idea is to be able to run a python function from a webpage inside firefox. My initial need : - based on the url/content of the page I am visiting, trigger automatically some process, and display its output. I know this can be done "easily" in JS, but I suck at JS so much that I decided to try and build a small framework in order to be able to do this with Python. I have just started today. If you guys have any suggestion, I'll listen carefully! For now, I have a flask app which is meant to be my FaaS server. My functions are there. And a Firefox extension which merely gathers some data, calls my flask app and render its results. I feel like I overcomplexified every thing from the start, but it works, so I'm kinda happy with it. Although if you guys have a more elegant solution to write easily a Firefox plugin with Python, I'll listen!

YAML is popular for the same reason python is - it's very terse, clean and readable. There's no need to [add indentation](https://github.com/leereilly/csi/blob/567e5b55f766847c9dcc7de482c0fd241fa7377a/lib/data/master.toml) to confusing syntax to make it readable because the indentation *is* the syntax.
Not helpful. This seems like a specific problem rather than a lack of knowledge on my part. Specifically, what do you assume I don't know, and what do you think I need to learn to solve this issue?
I’m very upset because I expected 102 books and there’s more than that. I feel like you lied to me. 
Just telling you this community is a bad place to ask this kind of questions, stackoverflow.com or /r/learnpython are suited a lot better. 
No argument from me on the spec length. But avoiding arbitrary code execution with PyYAML is as easy as using safe_load() instead of load().
OK. I appreciate that. I this community was OK to ask programming problems, and this seemed like a fit, but I have asked in learnpython as well. Actually posted on SO but got no replies so tried reddit. Can't seem to figure this out and if it's elementary I can't see it.

mplayer has it too actually. mplayer -vo caca file or mplayer -vo aa file
&gt; But avoiding arbitrary code execution with PyYAML is as easy as using safe_load() instead of load(). So you're saying that YAML's flaws can be overcome by implementing only a subset of it? Someone should make a library which does that.
I’m working on my 3rd day of learning to code Python. Newbie right here. ☝️
Wrong sub
Yeah, YAML definitely has a lot of points going for it. It's a shame that they had to wrap up those points in what we have today. I would be very happy for YAML to get universally dropped and replaced with strictYAML. But that's not going to happen, in the same way that Markdown has not been entirely replaced with CommonMark, so rather than try to guess which subset of the YAML spec has been implemented by any given library, I'd rather use something which didn't claim to be YAML (even if it had very similar syntax).

I don't really understand calculus, could you help explain it to me? That is a bad question and honestly makes me think you don't care about the answer
I taught python for several years and I have found there are many reasons why people don't get it. I will post the most common ones and you will have to decide which one applys to you and fix it. 1. Lack of practice. This is a new language you are learning languages are hard. You just have to keep at it. 2. bad instructor. All instructors have different styles If your instructor is not right for you sublement with different material that is better for you. 3. I think this is the most common of my students that did try hard is that they got lost on an early lesson and each lesson builds on the one before it. If you don't understand what a list is for instance how are you going to understand the code on how to loop over it. The solution is to go back through the lessons where you got stuck and re-write the code. Most of them will be fast. Your first lesson was probally hello world it is only one line of code. The stuff you do understand you will sail through. When they get hard this is where you go to focus until you understand the concepts. 4. Not focusing on the relevant material. For example lets say you are learning loops. You need to understand a for loop and a while loop. Just because you read list comprehensions are faster don't focus on them. 5. What you learn in programing 101 is to break down bigger problems into smaller solve-able ones. WHen your faced with a problem break it down into the parts you know. Its not much different this Algebra. You have a crazy equation you do it piece by piece until you get an answer. There are two books i recommend for people learning python. Learn Python the hard way and Think Python. What I like about learn python the hard way is you start with really small lessons that only take a few minutes at first. Zed Shaw is really good at breaking it down into small bitesized chunks. &amp;#x200B; Think python is based on a java book called think like a computer scientist. It is meant to be an intro to programing book. I think this is a really good book at teaching you why you do things. The book is freely downloadable I think the best is the lessons on Object Oriented Design I have never read a better explanation of that concept. &amp;#x200B; My last piece of advice is when you follow point three and you see where you got stuck. Go talk to your professor. As a professor I loved when students figured out the problem and came to me to help with the solution. I was glad to teach them the concept 1 on 1 using different language that was right for them.

How does any function/method do anything without you explicitly implementing it? It implements it itself. class Loop: def run_forever(self, coro): while True: self.run(coro)
In the event that you were looking to expand this small project even further, you could try to do some form of audio recognition to transcribe the audio from the file into subtitles for the video, unless you're planning on adding audio support in the future :P
;o is a good idea ... use the subtitles track :) thanks 
Ohhh I see. run_forever just awaits the coroutine and then runs it again when it returns. Cool.
Want to get another personal project. Still trying to find something worth doing and not a meaningless project. Anyone got anything they need done?
Talk direct w/aiopg or async psycopg2. Gives you much better control in an async environment. 
it's because as your loop goes through, you get to 6, 36 &lt;40, so it still goes through the loop again, adding one more. I'm not sure that response made a lot of sense, but I'm having a hard time wording it. 
Shut up and take my star lol
Ok that makes sense, but why does setting the number to 0 then adding 1 in the loop give the desired output of 36
When num reaches 6, the square is 36, smaller than 40, so num is increase one more time to 7. Since you recalculate num**2, the result is 49.
Yes that is a known problem. Just use this: https://github.com/BCSharp/PSCondaEnvs

Ok so because the number before the loop is already 1 it’s adding 1+1 instead of being done because the other addition is inside the loop?
where are you adding one in the loop? That changes things. If you are saying "while (num+1)\*\*2 &lt; limit:" then when you get to six, it will compute 7\*\*2 and realize it's too high, so it it will not iterate again.

I don't believe you. But on the chance you're not lying I'll direct you to some concepts that might help you. Look up data compression algorithms. (given your two versions of quantizers I'm sure Huffman encoding should be your first implementation. It almost certainly won't be very good but it's a lossless data compression scheme and should be a starting point. Next up I'd use arithmetic encoding, but instead of just compressing the values, I'd encode an initial value for the first ECG measurement, then I'd encode the difference between the current value (delta encoding). You'll also need to include some other useful information, like the sample rate, but those can occupy a few initial value locations in your encoded file. This way a decoder is capable knowing where it's at. You could also use the LZW compression scheme, or maybe LZ77, though this isn't really their target application. They're focused on string compression, not signal compression. But it could be interesting to see how playing with the signal values changes how well the dictionaries encode. Finally you could transform the signal using fast fourier transform, then encode that signal using any of the above methods. There's lots of other ways you could do it too. Just use zip, or 7z, or a tarball, that sort of thing. If all you need to do is find something to compress it, no restrictions, those solutions should work too. 
Hi, I am apart of the development group Team Nightowl Studios and I am looking to recruit new members who a knowledgeable about python.

I mentioned it in the original post another way to do it, which is what I was referring to, I get ahead of myself sometimes. 
No, I missed an apostrophe. It should read: &gt;unit testing also chips away at the advantages static typing brings to the table which pushes the point where static typing outweighs Python**'s** advantages further away. &amp;#x200B; In other words, as the project size, team size, and/or development timeframe increases, the point where the advantages of static typing begins to outweigh the advantages of python would come sooner if you didn't have unit tests. &amp;#x200B;
Try googling “pybind11”. That’s the modern way of doing it.
I typed "conda install -n root -c pscondaenvs pscondaenvs" in the command prompt but got the same error but instead of 'activate,' it said 'conda' is not recognized. Am I doing something wrong? Sorry for the dumb question.
For a moment I thought about libcaca here. Awesome work!
I would say 1% necessary at least.
Building a discord bot that tells me what torrents I have running and when they complete. Said bot also works with querying plex and searching movies.
Look in your Start Menu. There should be an Anaconda3 folder. Inside this folder will be "Anaconda Prompt". Run this and you'll get a command prompt with the anaconda base environment already activated. The prompt should show "(base) C:\\Users\\....&gt;". You can run python or conda from here. To activate/deactivate environments use "conda (de)activate". The course may be using an older Anaconda distribution as the root environment is now called base. Some conda basics: [https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/getting-started.html](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/getting-started.html) &amp;#x200B;
The problem here is the conda directory is not on the PATH. When you enter a command into the command prompt, Windows will search a series of locations for your command (plus ".exe", ".bat", ".cmd", ".com", etc.), this series of locations is called the PATH as it is stored in the environment variable called PATH. You can run this command to show the current PATH environment variable value: `echo %PATH%` It will be a list of directories separated by semi-colons. The Anaconda installer should have added the conda directory to the PATH itself but it looks like that isn't the case. I would suggest re-installing Anaconda and seeing if there is a step that mentions adding it to the PATH.

Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster. Show /r/learnpython the code you have tried and describe where you are stuck. **[Be sure to format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F)** and include which version of python and what OS you are using. *** ^(this bot is written and managed by /u/IAmKindOfCreative) ^(This bot is currently under development and experiencing changes to improve its usefulness)
Oddly enough it worked when I went with what I originally typed in in the "Anaconda prompt" instead of the command prompt. Is this the same thing?
Thanks. Yeah I plan to run it locally and I see that Django is a bit involved. Thanks for the advice
This is so cool!!
I want to create a script that allows me to import Shopify customer order data and spit out a dashboard of metrics such as customer lifetime value, customer return rate, etc. I know how all the math works since I have done it in Excel already. And I have learned a lot about building basic scripts in python from various sources (codecademy, etc.) so I would like to finally put that to the test with this project. Can anyone give me some advice on how to first import and structure the data so that I can begin to manipulate it? Shopify outputs a "csv" with all of the data is in separate columns with the column titles in the first row.
I wish I had an answer for you, but I suggest trying it out and seeing how it feels.
Once YouTube started demonetizing content creators he put his efforts into other Ventures. Believe it or not he still has a YouTube channel but it's dedicated to studying chess moves.
Thanks alot man you exactly pin pointes the scalibility issues and i didn't know how to hash bang before will do Once again Thanks a Lot man 😀😀
Hit me up what you want done.?
Yes, true. My last sentence was specifically about the quality of the server side of net/http. Primarily I was trying to comment on the suggestion that Go's stdlib http has "comm issues". My point is that it is quite good but my feeling was that the OP was missing some high level features that were in the requests library, and could also be available in 3rd party Go libraries if desired.

Something happened with the READMe
what happened?
It is parsed incorrectly there are bold equal signs all over the place, a whole paragraph is parsed as an H1
Requests doesn’t raise an exception for a bad status code by default, only for connection problems. You have to call response.raise_for_status() to get it to throw. It’s not a good API for encouraging good behavior! 
That's actually on purpose it is optimized for browser view from pc ill fiz it later. 😀
I use flask for personal projects. 
Funny that people are linking all these threading libraries, when the answer is in... the requests library: &amp;#x200B; [http://docs.python-requests.org/en/v0.10.6/user/advanced/#asynchronous-requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/v0.10.6/user/advanced/#asynchronous-requests)
Can someone tell me how can i fetch the value from Input textbox on button click and use that value to search something in my database. ?
One of the main barriers of adoption for blockchain technology is the volume of transaction processing. An abstract language such as python does not address this issue. The only thing it would be appropriate for is rapidly prototyping.
4-time PM here. Semiconductor (2x), smartphone hardware, and compiler software. &amp;#x200B; I learned Python because my (semiconductor) company was designing a chip for Deep Learning applications. I decided to learn how to build benchmark application code so that we could see how we were doing against our projected competition. &amp;#x200B; I recommend having some beginner-to-intermediate level programming knowledge in my pocket. It builds credibility with my developer teams if I can contribute to code reviews; I can build my own (simple) tools for data analysis; and it lets me understand how technology stacks are built. My favorite libraries are Numpy/SciPy/Pandas (Python), Rails (Ruby) and D3/Angular/React (Javascript). &amp;#x200B; Finally: it shows potential hiring companies that you have an interest in side projects. It's a net positive.
Working on /r/adventofcode this week. So far I'm 4 for 4 and I'm hoping to get all of them done this month. 
Isn't gtk a dead package? It'll be hard to find help.
**I am an amateur Python programmer** You can use packages like PyPdf inorder to extract the data in the pdfs and then somehow generate a metric to check the uniqueness of the file
