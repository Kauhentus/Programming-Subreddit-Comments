When you do this you can cross one thing off your bucket list.
How do you know your crud functions work? I'm not particularly religious about testing first, however my confidence that my endpoint does what I think it does is entirely from tests. I don't bother even locally running our app a lot of the time because my tests are 100% (to my knowledge) representative of the actual app io
I do a lot of work with older software that uses SOAP or other xml based serialization formats over the web, so it helps having a networking module tied in and having it auto-parse. You can use the module without requests, reading in any xml document to the XML() method exposed.
Supposed to be but some of us aren't that lucky and still have to deal with it everyday!
Python is older than the Zen of Python, which was originally written as a bit of observational humor about the best practices that had developed as the language grew. Obviously Python can't really stick to the Zen 100% without completely ditching backwards compatibility, but that doesn't mean it's not something the core team uses as a guideline, or useful for people who use Python to write libraries and programs.
Those work just fine. IdeaVim is very good nowadays, I suggest you give it another go. Granted, it doesn't support plugins, but hey.
Depends on what you are planing to do. Just look here: https://docs.python.org/2/library/filesys.html 
I'm almost sure it was Raymond Hettinger, but can't find the video. I remember he showed how to store RGB colors using tuples, named tuples and data classes.
I've found this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfxJYp9_nJA Although I guess the Python pioneer your are looking for might be Raymond Hettinger. Go on youtube and watch his amazing videos. Even if you are an experienced Python developer you can always learn something new from him.
Yeah, okay, I'll try again today and report back.
Cool app! Just as some feedback, when I go to "Create playlist" and it asks me to use my Spotify account, I clicked on cancel and it throws you to a "access_denied" page. Maybe you could make this more user friendly :) Good luck!

Thanks, I will checkout the challenges and see what / where that gets me
Thanks. This isn't quite what I had in mind, but it did lead me to the topic I was interested in: recordClass. 
`io` module is for input and ouput of file contents. `os` and `` is for working with files and directories. `shutil` has some higher level filesystem functionality.
You're coming at this from the wrong way. It's like saying, "I bought a hammer and am looking for a nail." If you have a problem that can be solved with a program, write it. If you have a repetitive task you hate doing, automate it. If a tool you like is open source, contribute to it. This may be your best route because if you get a job as a developer, chances are you're going to be working on an existing codebase and having experience reading and working with other people's code is really valuable in my opinion. As for tools, I like PyCharm but still mostly use a combination of tmux and vim (notepad++ if I'm working on Windows.) 
I really like pycharm and sublime text editor. But thank you for the input, maybe I am going about this the wrong way . 
0mq is indeed a good choice. My suggestion comes from a place of experience: Redis is an excellent tool with many uses and makes a powerful companion to Python programming. While it's perhaps not the tighest possible fit for this particular application, it's very much worth learning for any Pythonaut.
Why use this over https://andreacensi.github.io/contracts/ ?

A lot of the scripts I write need to work on RedHat Enterprise Linux 6.5 with Python 3.5.0. Using a remote interpreter on one of our servers ensures that I'm not going to get a fun surprise after writing it on my Windows laptop.

You can also customize the JVM settings for the pycharm process, increasing RAM should speed things up.

Hi, Can I use range function in this manner? def multiple(): for x in range(end): if x % 3==0 or x % 5==0 : total= total + x return total result=multiple() print(result) Still there is error. Error is : UnboundLocalError : Local variable 'total' is referenced before assignment. Can you help me with it ?
I was in bit hurry. So I forgot to read the side bar. Next time surely I will post it on /r/learnpython
Thanks for the reply. Yeah, this sounds waaay above what I'm capable/trying to do. I'll find another python project to bang my head against the wall with figuring out; asking nice sounds like a much better route. 
Thanks.. Got the range function. Working on it .
Probably people have packages that are written largely in C, not Python. Also the C-API for Python 2 is a fair bit different than that for Python 3. The pain between strings and bytes is a lot stronger when writing with the C-API. 
do a "total = 0" before your for-loop and you're good. your problem is that you use total in total = total + x but you haven't set a value to it before btw: write 4 spaces in front of every code line and reddit will recognize it as code

Haha why is the thumbnail a cute girl?
I was literally doing this the last 3 weeks. Now I can have a look at all the stuff that could improve in my application. Nice link :)
Where do you see it? I don't see it. Maybe the thumbnail you see is automatically pulled from the GitHub repository?
I actually got it running. Had to change the code a bit to put my main loop in the same code file as the menu. Works exactly how I wanted it now. I would be more than happy to do this in C or C++ but the most programming iv done in C++ was hello world lol. I specialized in python when I was in ITSEC and then found its one of the most common languages used in data science, so I stuck with it. Some of the programmers on my team are c++ trained, but they are to busy working on other projects at the moment. 
Pretty sure you don't have to run Python to serve it. It's supposed to be for some quick and dirty local testing only like `jekyll serve` or `hugo server`. From the README: &gt; 3. For an Internet-facing website, you would be hosting the static website/blog on a hosting service and/or with a web server such as Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, etc. You probably only need to generate the static files and know where the static files are and move them to your hosting location. &gt; ... &gt; `python makesite.py`

I am removing this post since it is beginner material for learning python. 
Python is meant to take advantage of super power computers to let humans think instead of worrying about memory management or data types. Modern C++ (C++11,14, 17) have gone a long way from the need to use "new", "delete" and "malloc". If you want to be lazy, you can just use "shared_ptr" everywhere and it will automatically do all the memory management for you. Modern python also encourages things like "MyPy" where types are "suggested". At that point, the difference in the code for the end product is much smaller. But, AFAIK, there is no C++ interactive prompt barring some recent [Jupyter additions](https://blog.jupyter.org/interactive-workflows-for-c-with-jupyter-fe9b54227d92?gi=851b0499360d). I actually get alot out of simply typing the name of a command and having it execute. My suggestion is just to learn both languages. Modern C++ and Python are a lot closer than you think.

django over flask. you will need migrations and other stuff and django has these things built in.
django isnt allowed either from what i can tell. what are django and flask actually called by the way? i am under the assumption that they are web hosting frameworks. is that the proper terminology?
Thank you so much for this!!!

Well... I wouldn't say Python is the one being silly.
Do they have specific reasons for not allowing a web framework beyond "we didn't make it/don't know what it is"? Trying to roll your own is going to take longer and probably be less secure in the end anyway.
I've made a similar mistake with iterators once that didn't get caught by unit tests and broke in production.
py3 looks ok to me, you're using a generator, you need to cache it &gt;&gt;&gt; m = list(map(lambda x: x.upper(), 'abc')) &gt;&gt;&gt; 'A' in m True &gt;&gt;&gt; 'B' in m True &gt;&gt;&gt; 'C' in m True
In Python 2 you do not cache an imap with list. Instead you simply use map.
Ah, I understand now! Thanks!
You're ABSOLUTELY correct! 
Find out why flask/any other python web framework isn't approved before trying to select one to use.

Yeah, it's the avatar of the repo owner. It's a common problem with github links on reddit. I mostly see it when browsing on my phone via reddit sync.
&gt; am under the assumption that they are web hosting frameworks. is that the proper terminology? they are just web frameworks. hosting is a separate issue if the two major python frameworks arent approved, what IS approved?
&gt; django over flask Django doesn't directly support MS SQL
What an unnecessary comment. This post is about the project, not the author's looks.
It gets better. I was a heavy Matlab user for a while, but had to make the switch about a year ago and luckily there is the python community and stackoverflow to rely on. You are not going to compete with Matlab in terms of use of use of graphics IMO, but python is a better programming language. And it’s free! So you can learn on your own and your employer doesn’t have to pony up the licensing costs. Use “#%%” to create blocks of code in spyder and ctrl enter to execute, like Matlab. 
I see Flask was used for serving up the static HTML/JS/CSS assets, but that's the full extent of Python's use here.
Ultrafast spectroscopy is love, ultrafast spectroscopy is life. 😁 Fellow"aspired" spectroscopist?
You need to have a nice long talk with your manager about the benefits of using python web frameworks and try to change your company's way of thinking. If i had a say with regards to how to setup this website i would tell them to dump MS SQL, and IIS server (and give MS the finger while your at it) and use the following: *Django or flask (i'm a personal fan of Django) *Postgres SQL run well and is free and open source with very good documentation. *Ubuntu LTS or Centos with Apache or Nginx And if they want to go all fancy cloudy they can run it on AWS for the first year for free.
Awesome sauce, thanks for that. Is there a way to have this run without directly needing to be in the python folder?

Why is Flask not approved? Because it's not 1.0?
Its pretty obvious if you read the documentation. 😁
Flask and Django are the most battle-tested web frameworks for Python. The fact that Flask is not approved is a red flag. I would find out why and then make a decision based on that. If it's a version issue, then you will probably have more trouble down the line since 1.0 versions mean nothing in the web dev world. Fight that battle now rather than down the line.
If you live and die by 1.0 versions, you will die in the web dev world.

Really nice post! I am currently using MkDocs and it is really good, but I will give it a try to this also!
As a product manager who works somewhere with this stack - why?
Yeah. For local development, Virtualenv is great for pure Python projects, but what if you need a test environment with a SQL database, an ElasticSearch store, maybe Redis, and whatever else? If you work on multiple projects, you can't really feasibly spin those up on your local machine, even if you run Linux. (Worse yet if you run Mac or Windows and you want to test something like ElasticSearch!) So, for that you might use VirtualBox or Vagrant. Or Docker. Those are considered remote interpreters by PyCharm because they're not part of your local environment. You ssh into them.
I admit I don't have a *ton* of experience with MS SQL, but from what I can tell it's a pretty good database. If I were the sort of person who wanted to pay a ton of money for my DB, I'd certainly choose it over Oracle or DB2.
Although it'd be insane of them to proscribe flask and allow what's basically asyncio flask
&gt; for free 14 day trial period, the site says.
They're both extremely good platforms. Put down your prejudice. 
Ignorance breeds contempt
My professor tossed us into Python coding for our introductory evolution class, and I haven't really coded before. SO BIT OF A LEARNING CURVE GOING ON RIGHT NOW. Before I continue on with the code, I want to at least have it interpreted (beyond line 10) what I am doing and what each line is contributing to the program. This is only the first few lines or so. I previously loaded numpy and panda. 
This isn't how enterprises work. If this company is big (and if they're running that stack, they probably are), they'll have teams to manage infrastructure. Teams that include sysadmins who know IIS inside and out and DBAs experienced with MSSQL. They're not going to flip their tech stack because one of their devs wants to gold plate their CV with some Python. Honestly, with that stack, OP should just go with .NET. It will be 'approved' and works seamlessly with the underlying infrastructure. 
Looks nice. Now you just need to get it listed on this website: https://staticsitegenerators.net/
You shouldn't have a variable named pop, it's a list/dict attribute used for popping items in said list/dict. W is a dict, N is an int, and pop is a list (list() = []). pop.append("aA") assigns "aA" to pop; now pop = ["aA"] for n in range(N-1) =&gt; if you're familiar with c, it's equivalent to: for (int i = 0; i &lt; 19; i++) and then performs "pop.append("aa")" 19 times. So then at the end of execution, pop will equal ["aA", "aa", "aa", "aa", ..] Does that make sense?

Proper use iof functions? (as in main purpose?). I intended to do just one big function to be imported as necessary. Should I just place it all in the main code with the rest of my code, this is only to establish OS, Ver % architecture to load appropriate scripts

Django.. they will impressed if you tweak it to do something cool 😊
I don't know much about PyInstaller, I just hope it doesn't execute anything during the conversion process. Because if it does you kinda just let people execute anything they want on your server.
Bad advice. Django is OK to get started with but is inflexible and you will outgrow it. Flask is a lot more flexible and composable, and allows you to only include the stuff you need. Django migrations in particular are very inflexible. There are many different ways to manage migrations and you should have the freedom to choose how to do it, not be forced into using particular migration tools just because you use a particular framework.
Need to name it something like TheNewestVersionOfIIS. So you can respond with "No, we're using the newest version of IIS".
I use mssql at my office and compared to the 20 minutes of experience I have on postgres with at home projects, I would pick postgres every day. Every time I have to write a convoluted partition by statement because mssql doesn't support UNIQUE ON I die a little inside.
Theres nothing wrong necessarily, but I personally don't like the stack. But the reason I said OP should quit is because it sounds like OP works for an enterprisey Microsoft shop. If he's trying to use Python and open source tech, he's gonna have a bad time.
Unless their company has 3 employees and 5 customers I don't think an EC2 mini instance is going to cut it. While I'm a big fan of postgres the language is much too different to just switch over seamlessly
I can write a gui that behaves in a nonsensical way. Similarly, i can use a strange lambda, with imap. Similarly, I can overwrite Python to say `1==2`. The problem is not python.

Thank you very much. I was looking for a way to create an api for my already existing django project and I think this will help. 
Yes, the author's usage of `FORCE` is specified in the POSIX standard too. See [The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7, 2018 edition - make](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/make.html) where they specify: &gt; As a consequence of the general rules for target updating, a useful special case is that if a target has no prerequisites and no commands, and the target of the rule is a nonexistent file, then make acts as if this target has been updated whenever its rule is run. &gt; &gt; **Note:** &gt; This implies that all targets depending on this one will always have their commands run.

Yes, I totally get that moment!!! For example, once upon a time I was drunk and got angry about circlejerking and excessive moderation on a subreddit. In a moment of pure genius I coded up a downvote bot to upset the flow if the circlejerk. Once coded (took about 15 mins) I installed it onaheadless raspberry pi, hit ‘go’, went to the pub and got even more drunk. About 2 weeks later I realised it was still running, the subreddit was going crazy about it and I was banned shortly afterwards. Aaaah a pure piece of drunken genius :D 
I completed level 4 and (eventually) got a telephone interview. It was quite fun, and *hard*. Some of the later bunny questions were pretty bloody obscure.

That will return a list *type* if the key isn't found, and a list of characters otherwise... Code like this is how you get those insane bugs where suddenly it's saying something like "TypeError: 'type' object is not iterable" and you're pulling your hair out trying to understand why most the time it works.

Ok what if mining is taking a video of you taking a drink and verification would be other people watching the video and acknowledge that you drank. In other words you're hooked up with a drinking buddy and mine the currency which you use to buy each other drinks. It's a currency backed by social drinking which history tells us is pretty much a constant.

Got that as a "soft" requirement recently. Couldn't do it, but it's functional and was only 16 lines. No docs. Boss loves it. I cried and died inside. 
Weed is better imo
It shouldn't return the list type. Since you assign to *list* inside the function, all references to it will be compiled as references to a local variable, whose value at the start of the function is unbound. If *list* is never actually assigned to (due to control flow), returning it will just give you an UnboundLocalError. 
I get that. What's the python motto. I was just wondering if there are any other books that could be recommended for somebody who's a python noob.
You two are cute. Now kith. 
I'm working on getting off 3.4 where I was stuck due to esky and PySide. Moving to pyinstaller/pyupdater and PyQt5 took time and is still causing me trouble. Changes to the import system and the C/C++ extension compiler stuff I think are some of the reasons. On Windows every version before 3.5 required all the extensions to be compiled with a specific version of Microsoft's compilers.

I continually learn by checking the top posts in r/python at least monthly for content I didn't know about or interesting discussions. I also watch lots of conference talks from YouTube and pyvideo. I only look at documentation when trying to solve a specific problem, not when I have some time and I just want to learn something interesting.
Why does Windows ME relate to this? I am afraid I am not old enough to remember.
Agreed, I always check the comments first. If the top comments are negative feedback, I don't bother, but if they are fruitful discussion or at least positive, then I might check it out.
Agreed I generally assume that I actually wouldn't learn anything in r/learnpython because I'm not a beginner, so I never go there.
Not a chance, buddy.
When a new version of python or any major library is released, I would expect some good discussion here and that's part of why I come here as my one stop shop for python community. I don't have friends to discuss python 3.7 with, so I come here. Topics on it will come up whenever PEP's are approved or beta's released, etc, and I'll benefit from reading everyone's thoughts in it.

I've pythoned while drunk before, and implemented [quantum tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tic-tac-toe), which was very fun.
**Quantum tic-tac-toe** Quantum tic-tac-toe is a "quantum generalization" of tic-tac-toe in which the players' moves are "superpositions" of plays in the classical game. The game was invented by Allan Goff of Novatia Labs, who describes it as "a way of introducing quantum physics without mathematics", and offering "a conceptual foundation for understanding the meaning of quantum mechanics". *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

MS SQL is quite good actually, I used it in a previous job a lot and I liked the TSQL syntax. I liked it over Oracle. Now I have to work with MySQL.. that's an ouch!
I heard about people making a programming language while being drunk. I think it's called javascript or something. Hopefully no one is using it.

That is a nice toy example :D
You use globals as little as possible, because they make your code an unmaintainable and error-prone mess. You should pass parameters into a function and return values from the function. That makes it more explicitly clear when you call the function how it is going to affect the program state, unlike a call to a function which messes around with global variables. Use of globals should mostly be reserved to read-only access to variables or functions which really are conceptually "global" in some way. If you're using the `global` keyword, there's a very good chance that you're Doing It Wrong and could do things more cleanly with parameter passing. I don't recall *ever* using `global` in the wild in about a decade of programming in Python. I can't answer your other question because you deleted your post and I have no idea what is in your code. I'm guessing that you had arbitrarily broken up your code into functions which you call in order only once, which is completely pointless and which I consider an antipattern. Functions are not something that you sprinkle on your code to break it up when it looks like it's too long. You use them to encapsulate blocks of functionality which is related, distinct in some way from the surrounding functionality, and *which you want to reuse*, possibly with different parameters. If you want to use global variables in your functions because they're just actions you perform once on global state in sequence, that's a good sign that you shouldn't be using functions.
ME had a major issue where it would just crash over time. There was no stopping it. If I remember correctly it was filling up the filesystem and after a certain file got too big it would stop working. This resulted in a blue screen at boot time, which for casual users meant their computer was rendered useless.
Also, Microsoft gave usage guides to external developers noting which registers aren't safe after calling functions and developers got lazy when they noticed certain ones were consistent. But since their manual told developers not to trust them, next addition they used them for something else, which triggered blue screens from 3rd party kernel drivers. Everyone blamed it on Microsoft and even though it wasn't their fault they scrambled to patch their own system to defend their name. One thing they did that's easy to notice is add a ton of games to the registry even if you don't have them. If by chance you did buy one of these games these *hacks* would be there already.

Ahhh, Reddit code reviews
This makes me wonder what effect micro-dosing on other drugs that effect cognitive functioning would do. LSD? Psilocybin? Ritalin? I've read that people in Silicon Valley do experiment with different stuff to enhance productivity. 
you inspired me... [critiquing joke code](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/86scr1/me_hey_guys_look_at_this_funny_code_that_ill/)
'Learn Python the Hard Way' should not be read. The author of that book is known for his ridiculous views in the programming community, which he also pushes with his books. I can't recommend reading that book in good faith. Automate the boring stuff though is a good start for getting your hands dirty quickly. In terms of thinking like a programmer I think 'Think Python' by Allen Downey is great and it is available for free as PDF.

What size should that project have? Things I've done (mainly for fun/ learning purpose) in Python recently: * Maze generating / solving algorithms * Sudoku solver * A game (a very bad sim city remake) * Telegram bots are also cool * implementing all sorts of algorithms for a better understanding of how they work (RSA, Prime number generator, K-Means, ...) Maybe you can do something with Flask? Some day i might want to build a simple weather model to understand how these work, but that will probably get very math heavy

Woah, example of even using yield in list comps?

Yeah I'm not an expert honestly, I just made that project for fun. Anyone who wants to participate is welcome. but I'll drop the instructions to set it up locally on GitHub for anyone who's suspicious
I will call this style "functionable programming"
It just turns your list comprehensions in generators. And your generators into a mess. It's a bug with the way python interprets list comprehensions similarly to functions. 
I have this a stab a while back. I found Kivy hard to get working and there isn't much support for troubleshooting it. I tried to install it on 3 different computers (2 mac 1 Linux) and could not even get the module installed. It might be a python 3 problem but I couldn't get an answer. I even asked on here. I put it on hold, but when I pick it up again I am leaning more towards React.
I've tried all three. Ritalin helps a bit, but honestly not a great feeling and if you're using it you're probably a 12 year old diagnosed with ADD cause amphetamines are way better. LSD didn't really effect my ability to program that much at all surprisingly. It was pretty distracting though, would not really recommend, it's just less fun (again, amphetamines all the way). For Psilocybin, it's just as distracting as LSD but your ability to do basic logic is a lot more impaired so you just feel like an idiot the whole time. People in silicon valley are doing amphetamines. Adderall, Vyvanse, etc
Yeah oops, thats what I meant.
Anaconda 2x and 3x has an excellent parser function that tosses your data into an object called a DataFrame. I have had great success with read_csv and read_excel, as they are pretty much transparent to the user. The docs tout the read_json capability to be much the same. I would take that route. The Pandas DataFrame is a great little data object, and data manipulation is fast if you use the methods pandas provides. I did analysis on 400,000+ lines of data from a hospital database, and was able to filter, group, sort and conduct transformations and graphical analysis with little fuss. Something that made Minitab choke and die. Search for anaconda3 if you are using python3. The documentation is very thorough and there are numerous books out there that provide procedures and special cases.
This is also a reported bug. So you should not be using it. It enhances your list comprehensions so that you can get two values per loop, but you can also do that with nested loops off course. However, that is sometimes a bit hard too read. x = [[(yield i), (yield i**2)] for i in range(10)] x = list(x for i in range(10) for x in (i, i**2))

Cant you already do this with tuples though? [(x, y) for x in y] I realize this isnt an actual list comp you would use.
Is that the app or the site? Either way, the fact that they don't use their own parser is a shame
It’s the app, and yeah it is...
That's not leet at all. We don't hire programmers who are only let.
Yea that’s what I had seen as well, which is pretty interesting. But I thought I would make a joke.
Excellent! Thank you.
Don't get so triggered by an internet comment. Just move on with your day.
I tend to deal with a lot of faulty code written by my colleagues, especially if they are trainees. That is the nature of working with humans. But fortunately python makes finding and fixing errors exceptionally easy(compared to other languages) by providing comfortable introspection facilities. If dealing with errors is not your thing you should isolate yourself from other people, which accidentally would also be better for everybody else. Also, you should start writing perfect code only.
Thanks for that. If I can get the package installer to load it, I'll give it another shot.

I second the recommendation for [Think Python](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) (formerly known as "How to Think Like a Computer Scientist", because it teaches you not just the language, but also how to program. I can't say how it compares to "Learn Python the hard way" or "Automate the boring stuff with Python", because I haven't read those two; but it's a very good beginners' book in its own right.

You can combine Flask with [eventlet](http://eventlet.net/) using a [Gunicorn worker](http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/design.html) and do something like, @app.route('/') def view(): eventlet.spawn(fetch_facebook) ... Alternatively you can use an asyncio based framework, such as [Quart](https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart) to do something like, @app.route('/') async def view(): result = await fetch_facebook() ... Where you'd likely want to use aiohttp to do an async request. [Here](https://gist.github.com/pgjones/1f2e873caedc6bc7bc1518606d9d79ac#file-fetch_app-py) is a full example of what I mean. Note: I am the Quart author.

It took over a year of updates for Win10 to turn to shit for me. Now the OS is slow because it does pointless background tasks whenever it meets a loose definition of idle, or just starts a broken process like Superfetch.
Anything you'd like more integrated into the OS I'd presume. I wrote a very simple "status" app for myself (basically it shows me certain train schedules and other info 100% tailored to exactly what I personally search all the time). I did it as a webpage as you say which I can quickly open, but it would be really nice if I could have it display right on my screen without the phone even needing to be unlocked (i.e. push power button and it shows). This is my personal example, but basically anything were you'd like to exploit the OS would be an example. Of course not all apps fall in this category. Incidentally, if anyone knows how to do what I want on an Iphone 5c, I'm all ears. :) Though I don't plan on getting a developer license for something so simple and personal on my own phone so I doubt I can do it the way I'd like. Also I don't plan on trashing the phone until it's actually trash, but it seems like it'll keep chugging for quite a while longer.

Modafinil is fine but it definitely comes in second compared to Ritalin/Adderall/Vyvanse.
Yeah, there are definitely use cases for a native app (including "it'd be fun to make one" or "it'll look good on myt resume to make one"). But these days there are less reasons to *need* to do a native app IMHO. And it frees you from the Apple/Google walled gardens :) 
The first path took 23 ms, second 44 ms, 3rd 58 ms, 4th 20 ms, 5th 8 ms, 6th 15 ms, 7th 7 ms.
Thank you, that’s awesome! Didn’t think of browsing PyPI. 
Sure... I guess if you don't mind killing someone eventually... Long-term Amphetamine use = Psychotic Episodes. Adderall (known generically as Amphetamine Slats Combo) is literally the perfect combination of the 2 Amphetamine isomers... Vyvanse is a prodrug of Ritalin and I would say it was comparable in some ways to Modafinil because of its long half-life actually reduces the abuse potential... It still causes a lot of euphoria though, which is great if you want to get high but really distracting if you need to get shit done. Adderall, on the other hand, is just addictive and dangerous. Pick, your poison... Choose carefully though, because what you choose could put you in a state that impacts others.
Explain more about the game. It looks interesting. What does it do? What is the idea?
Right now I'm just working on the mechanics behind the pathfinder. So the white boxes would be things like buildings, lakes, etc. The game will be a top down RPG with point and click mechanics kinda like Starcraft or age of empires.
Nice. Let me know when you are done with this. I am new to python. Are you using pygame?
Yes I am using Pygame 3.4.4
I think you may be confusing methamphetamines with other amphetamines. Meth psychosis is a thing, but it doesn’t typically feature in Adderall or methylphenidate.
Nice. What's the code look like?
This is awesome!!
OK. May we see it? 
Good tutorial, nothing new for me but looked really solid. The only thing I was surprised by was that they rolled their own permissions by overriding the APIView methods, rather than using DRF's Permission classes (permissions.BasePermission). I dont mind it though, DRFs permission system is not intuitive and hard to generalize and doesnt map well to ViewSets having different permissions required.

Thanks! Took a lot of time to create this!
Without dumping 3,000+ lines of code it will be very confusing to follow; however, I am happy to explain the general principle behind it. It starts by drawing a line between the character and the goal. Then takes all objects it intersects with and takes the corners of the objects and path finds to these (trying to find a route around the object). It repeats this process of path finding to every possible "node" (a corner of an object or the goal) until it checks every possible outcome and finds a path between the two points. It eliminates paths if there is a shorter distance to a point, if the path so far is shorter than a path found to the goal, or if there is a collision between the object and a line. There is also a few other ways it eliminates paths but you hopefully understand the general principle.
&gt; The code is about 400 lines long ... &gt; Without dumping 3,000+ lines of code I don't understand. Also &gt; it will be very confusing to follow Not necessarily for everyone here; some of us can manage.

I started Monday with Flutter and wrote basically with no trouble an app that was initially a thing to let you place Snapchat-like on a background. Then rewrote in React Native because what I wanted to do didn't have a readily available library. React was a total headache, constant silent errors, undefineds, poor documentation on how to start a project, and would also randomly break. I already had some big project's worth of experience with JavaScript but no previous exposure to Dart. Ultimately when my Native project developed a show stopping bug that wasn't solved by checking out and restarting, I abandoned it in favor of going back to the Flutter app and creating the library support I was missing. Don't repeat my wasted 3 days on React unless you're making something very basic and don't care about super fine grained control. Use Flutter especially since it takes ~20 minutes to setup as opposed to a few hours.
Yeah, it was a big move for Microsoft. I think this is where they removed DOS too. It did suck but it was a step in the right direction because Windows 10 is pretty solid.

"mildly annotated". *Comments every single line*. Lol. Good stuff, I just thought that was funny
AFAIK it does. It might lose some space due to not doing things like rounding corners etc. that's still a wip... also is does check for size so for instance the last path doesn't cut through the smaller space.
A cluster of midpoints between known boundaries gives you a vague list of predefined waypoints. A* can easily then build on top of that.

So wait, how does it know when its time to start raycasting again once its tracking around an object? It seems from the gif, it repeates the raycast once its arrived at any corner. If this is true, wont this be a major issue if the objects are more advanced polygons, with more than 4 corners?
Very cool! Those lines are draw in real time then? You aren't slowing it down as a visual effect? Since that is a really performance intensive operation, that is something you might consider moving in to a C++ module at some point to improve the performance.
You should think about creating a library out of this. Make a python package and set it up on pypi. I would be happy to help if you need.
I updated the post ..Thx :)
As a recommendation I give out frequently: You have a main block of you logic loop that begins for i in range(0,len(self.paths) ): You should get used to using the python builtin "enumerate". Essentially enumerate will iterate over any sequence that supports iteration (like a list) and return two items on each iteration - the index of the item and the item from the sequence. So your main for loop is really saying "I want to iterate over self.paths and do some logic based on one or more of the items it contains and I need to know the index of each item ...". Rather than making a range object to get something with the same length of self.paths, just iterate over self.paths directly: for idx, path in enumerate(self.paths): # first iteration will have idx=0, path=self.paths[idx] # of course you can still use `i` instead of idx Likewise you'll probably want to do the same thing for you loop over self.nodes: for j, node in enumerate(self.nodes): # first iteration starts at j=0, node=self.nodes[j] At a quick glance, you could clean up a lot of your for loops this way.
Let's be honest, you've never used either and are just riding the anti-MS bandwagon because you think that's what the cool kids do. The .NET stack of 2018 is incredible - anything you can do with Flask or Django, you can do with .NET. Visual Studio is the best IDE on the market, by an absolute country mile - every feature you like about PyCharm was pretty much in Visual Studio circa 2008. I love Python way more than I ever did C#, but only amateurs scoffs when talking about the MS offerings.
It looks to me like he creates a CDT (constrained delaunay triangulation) or it's equivalent voronoi diagram. Then, he probably uses Dijkstras to find the shortest center point to center point to center point path, or perhaps a funnel method. Recommended reading if you want to implement an awesome algorithm like this can be found in a research paper [here.](https://i.imgur.com/d4HhrmH.jpg).

PythonOCC, gives you tools to analyze your parts. For instance, you can do simple stuff like volume measurement or more complex topology exploration of solids, faces, curves. Really cool stuff being able to access such information from code, lots of control. For reading, dig into the API which reveals how to work with the truly powerful tool that is OCC, OPENCASCADE. You can also build some pretty awesome stuff with it too.

I guess in this case I'm going to have to respectfully disagree... I am by not an expert but there is a decent amount of logic that goes into the code. It could be cleaner with ways shown above but I think all the if statements are necessary. The for loops are excessive but I don't think there is an alternative that is objectively different. Cleaner syntax yes but the principle remains.
I don't know any time differences because I never implemented either. I would guess that since those two have been refined over many years they would be faster but I would wager not a significant amount faster for the purpose that I will be using them for.
For my game I couldn't perform the whole pathfinder multiple times in the same frame or else it would cause a drop in fps so it's spread out over multiple frames. So it continuously would check all nodes and the pathfinder stops when it exceeds the allotted time in ms. And then starts back up the next frame for the allotted time. More advanced polygons never cause an issue outside of being more taxing as they are more complex.
I realize this is not exactly what you're asking for but you may want to check out [plotnine](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) I am not an expert on ggplot2 but this appears to be the most complete and updated ggplot2-like library for python. Looking at the github activity, it has been updated as recently as today - so that's pretty fresh :) The other newer option is to look at [altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) which is another declarative visualization library that I think shows a lot of promise too. Trying to map ggplot2 aesthetics to matplotlib is going to be challenging. I think you'd be better off using one of the aforementioned libraries. Good luck.
Or useful expected behaviour!
The general algorithm (I think) goes like this: 1) draw a line from the destination to the current location 2) find all the object that line intersects 3) find corners of those objects that have line of sight to the destination 4) treat those corners destinations and repeat steps 1-4 until you've found the shortest path.

You can tell me if I'm off here, but A* is a "pretty good, pretty quickly" search, right? Once it finds a a path to a goal, using some heuristic to hopefully choose good moves, it terminates. His search seems to be nearly comprehensive - it explores all paths to the goal by some method (while pruning cycles) and then chooses the objective best. 
I see your point. I guess in this case the only way to reduce indentation I see is to "spread" the code out more by placing each loop into its class but I don't see them as removable. I will look back over it.
Huh...I see what you are saying. Awesome thanks!
This. Learning this trick changed my code for the better and I've never looked back. This and closures

Rookie here, what are some ways to reduce the amount of indentation you use in your code?

Hi there, this post has been removed as it is not directly related to the Python programming language. It might be more topical on /r/programming, /r/coding, or /r/technology. Cheers, /r/Python mods
I've seen professional applications with stupid long loops with crazy amounts of indentation. At a certain point, it's harder to maintain and change anything. 
I completely forgot to mention that the signal processing implementation is being developed in Python and that is why I posted it here
I'm working on a control script for my electronics project that uses digital potentiometers to control levels on RGB LEDs. I'm trying to use threading to get them all to update at the same time which is proving difficult as I have to output a 16 bit control signal to the pots. I got round data confusion by creating 3 'databuses' (One on each colour) and using separate pins for each chip select but have ran into problems with output from threads when the values change. Overall it's a good brain teaser and converting hex to rgb was a challenge!
Pretty cool!
It seems your questions are still not related to Python though. &gt; So, what I’m asking is: 1. Does anyone know why applying the FFT algorithm twice give me the frequency response? 2. How can I obtain the correct frequency axis?
Bearing in mind that if you're possibly getting values that you don't trust from s3, then this is unsafe, since pickle allows for arbitrary code execution. You'd need to seralise/deseralise the object in order to do this safely for untrusted storages. Probably not an issue with this use case, but something to keep in mind.
Functions, guards ( if / continue / break). You also need to make all this insensitive to context (no dependencies to globals)
Not wrong. And for a "prototype" code it *is* rather clean. Your algorithm basically solves the same problem at different scales, right ? If so the "detour" part could be a single function called over different parameters, for instance. Ideally you would end up with the "high order logic" in a main block, and "problem solving logic" in some other blocks. Much easier to maintain ( also to extract to reuse)
Just changed it
I have a few pointers: Your algorithm is very simple. Usually in Python, you can express an algorithm with about as many characters as it takes to describe the algorithm in English. If I'm getting this right, the basic idea is: 1) find all the objects that lie on the line between the destination and the source 2) A: If there are no objects, a path has been found B: find all the corners of those objects that have line-of-sight to the destination 3) treat those corners as destinations and repeat 1-3 4) return the shortest path I understand it's a little more complicated than that, but not excessively so. You can add caching and pruning etc. after you get the basic version going and it should even be fairly concise. If the only state you maintain between runs is memoization, then you want a function, [not a class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0). Comments are O.K., but it's usually better to flesh-out your algorithm by breaking up the work into yet-to-be-written helper functions: def find_path(source, destination, map): obstacles = intersections(source, destination, map) if not obstacles: return [source] possible_paths = [] for vertex in vertices(obstacles, destination, map): possible_paths.append(find_path(source, vertex, map) return [destination] + min(possible_paths, key=path_length) Now you have to define some helper functions: `intersections`, `vertices`, and `path_length` I would highly recommend going on YouTube and watching any videos you can find featuring [Raymond Hettinger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSGv2VnC0go&amp;index=3&amp;list=PLRVdut2KPAguz3xcd22i_o_onnmDKj3MA). I usually discourage using recursion in Python because its easy to cause a stack overflow especially if you're often using other people's code and you don't know (or shouldn't have to know) if their implementations also use recursion. Thankfully it's fairly easy to turn a recursive function into an iterative one. You simply make your own 'stack' object within the function to keep track of the state of previous iterations: def find_path(source, destination, map): paths, completed = [[destination]], [] while paths: path = paths.pop() dest = path[-1] obstacles = intersections(source, dest, map) if not obstacles: completed.append(path + [source]) else: paths.extend(path + [v] for v in vertices(obstacles, dest, map)) return min(completed, key=path_length) Learn and use [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and the [google code style guidelines](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) and try to stick to them (but don't be super anal about the google code guidelins). Keep names, especially local variable names, simple. If you have a `ChessGame` class just call it Chess, we know chess is a game. If `Chess` has a `chess_board` attribute, call it `board`. `ChessGame.chess_board` is obnoxious. If a word appears once on the path to something, that's *usually* enough. If you have: `from boijuniors_games.boijunior_chess import BoijuniorChessBoard` you're making puppies cry. [This is a good talk on coding style.](https://vimeo.com/74316116) That is all. ...for now.
Interesting. I never knew you could use `continue` with `while`. It's like I've discovered using `else` with `for` all over again!
Great book if you already know how to program
Thanks!
Could you use the corners of the obstacles (+ start and end points) as nodes of the graph and then run Djikstra?
google python-for-android also try out kivy 
Look. I am sorry. I am on mobile. I can't see rules on it. You don't have to ridicule me. I have learned my lesson. Why do you like making people feel like shit?
I didn't ridicule you; I told you exactly how and where to post your code so you could get help with it. Google your mobile reddit app + "sidebar" and quit being a damned baby. 
I have removed this post since it is material aimed at beginners. /u/illuminatiiiiii Please stop posting this material
Cool! It also looks like it's built in a way where you could modify the 'resolution' of the pathfinding to dynamically trade off accuracy for speed if there are a large number pathfinding at once.
What do you mean using else with for?
&gt; for i in range(0,len(self.paths) ): You can just write `for i in range(len(self.paths)):`
I've heard of Kivy, what exactly is it?
`else` is basically "if no break happenes" for the `for` loop: for user in users: if user.name == wanted_user: print(f'{wanted_user} exists!') break else: # no break print(f'{wanted_user} not found')
This is a great comment and I hope that OP reads it. 
Yeah I updated my comment with an example of using the `found` variable, and also an example on how it should actually be done 99.9% of the time (with a separate function). &gt; Is there a list of random things like this I could read? Not that I know of, you just learn these over time. You could try googling "advanced python" or something.
There is only one example in there that looks like it might not be the shortest route, but if it's taking in to account the size of the object and where it can fit, then the route it takes might make sense. 
and now you are threatening me really? thanks a lot, 
Yes, but if you ever need to do self.paths[i] why not just use enumerate?
Hey, that’s very interesting and has potential in commercial uses for airline or Uber. I was wondering if it is an AI since it takes less time to find the path each time?
&gt; 'Learn Python the Hard Way' should not be read. The author of that book is known for his ridiculous views in the programming community, which he also pushes with his books FUD :P
Yup, so renamed it as Python news.
I think flake8 committed suicide. 
huh, never seen anyone reference Interactive Python here b4. 
That should work. If you change direction in the middle of a 'road' then there is a shorter path where you cut that corner. The only place where this isn't possible is at the corners of obstacles, so except for those the path should be straight, hence Dijkstra or A* on the corners of obstacles should be sufficient. 
Anki has tags already, so you might not need to add anything. If you do, you can actually just write a plugin in Python rather than modifying Anki itself.
This is all great advice. Thank you!
The rule for implementing qttt is you can't use pseudo-random

Ooh, thanks for that tip. In the past, when I’m iterating through a list and need to know the index and contents, I iterate through a range the same length of the list (for the index), and then use somelist[i] (for the contents). This will definitely simplify things!
The worst part is the tabs. I mean I'm not some fanatic, but I legitimately thought this was a lot of empty code on mobile before scrolling all the way right.
I don't know, I'm not an expert in pathfinding algorithms, but this doesn't look very efficient to me. It looks cool and is certainly innovative, but it cannot be very fast. On a large map the calculation time must get exponentially larger 
ah got it cool man
We use the PermissionClasses pretty extnesively, but like you said, for some simple things they are a overkill. 
You should think about your own time-to-market. You can invest all kinds of time in NumPy and SciPy and Pandas etc, but are you going to be able to make a lateral move from where you are into a position that leans on those? My lateral move was from internet marketing to analytics and BI. I learned matplotlib and Tkinter, but still haven't found a use for them because 90% of my work involves working with reporting APIs and building the ETL mechanisms that move the data in and out of Azure and Power BI. Don't spend your precious time learning how to make games if you're not realistically going to become a well-paid entry-level game developer at age 40.
That wasnt what OP asked.. Lol. OP was talking about making mobile apps using python, not using python on mobile devices.
A* can find the optimal path with the right heuristic. Without one it's just Dijkstra, and that's been mathematically proven to find the shortest path. This, however... Without looking at the code I can't be sure, but OP himself doesn't say it's the shortest path.
I have not run it personally, but I would assume you’ll need to install Python and whatever libraries the code uses (I know you at least need to install pygame, not sure on others. If you’re a windows boy, after installing python, go to the command prompt and type “pip install [lib_name]” The library name should be the same as what it says after ‘import’ in the code.) Go into python idle (go to the start menu and type idle, “Python IDLE” should come up), and make a new python file. Paste the code into the file, and run it.
I am holding back on saying things I shouldn't say about your code.
whats your question?
Learning! The end goal is a distributed system of multithreaded scripts that do various tasks as assigned by a controller and 'move' themselves around to avoid congestion with on the fly expansion capability--if I can convince management to use on demand virtual servers. It should be fun assuming I can realize this vision. I'm on for loops now. :) (and /s... sort of. I'm really new to this.)
I believe so. There’s a guide to building APKs for applications. I’ve only managed to follow the first two app tutorials but if you want to build an android app the easiest of the two ways using Kivy’s proprietary tools, you’ll need Linux or OSX. It’s very near the the beginning of the guides/tutorials for the library. I’d recommend looking through the official site tutorials from the start to get context on what I’m talking about (the part you want is step 2 of the “crash course” section though): https://kivy.org/docs/tutorials/pong.html Best of luck!

Technically I agree but author of Code Complete would complain a lot :D
Interesting. We can just use itertools.chain instead: itertools.chain(*((i, i**2) for i in range(10))) That also looks nicer to me. However this method doesn't exploit a bug, so it's not as cool in that way. :P

Can I get a look at your code? I am learning Python currently, so.
Python isn't native to most mobile devices. That's a massive strike against that approach. Web dev and mobile dev are two very different things. 
Hey xThad, I‘m sorry that you downvoted for this question. I will try to explain my point of view. I‘m currently a python developer. I start learning flask as my first python web framework. It‘s exactly a micro-framework with build-in functions like wsgi support, security and requests. It‘s very lean but you have to do a lot by your self or over third party modules called extensions. You should have a good understanding about python design pattern, if you want to build a productive flask application. Django is more a out-pf-the-box framework that manages all your requirements. It‘s fast to build web apps with that but you underlay the restrictions of the django framework. The Problem with Python in webdev is that it is not so established like PHP or JS. But it‘s a very powerful alternative! In my case I‘m using ReactJS as my frontend technologie and flask as my backend component. I‘m sorry but I have no expirience with Mobile Dev. But I know many developer that are starting kotlin in mobile dev. My personal advice for you is to start anywhere you want. It‘s more importent to keep going to practice development than to think about the best framework or language. Every language have his own power and Philosophy. Try to enjoy learning new things. That is the most important ability in development. I‘m sorry for my bad english. You are welcome. Start small, stay tuned. Best regards from germany

You should of course use enumerate, but that was not what I was commenting on.
No serious company is developing mobile apps with Python. At least not today, who knows what crazy popular framework will pop up in 5 years time (but still, my money wouldn't be on Python). PHP is a garbage language, but it's ubuquity makes it useful to know, particularly popular frameworks like Laravel, Cake, CI etc, and you should know how to develop plugins and extensions to Wordpress. Python is a nice web dev language - I love Flask (like 80% of the time), and Django is awesome to get a site up and running in a morning, but there's a **lot** more NET based web dev jobs out there, so if web development is your aim, then learn a couple of Python frameworks and learn C#. For mobile development, you need to be working in native, which means Java/Kotlin or Objective C/Swift. Some places will use Xamarin and other cross platform frameworks, but not that many.
I second this. Don't look too far from std and use an ide
Go follow the same Zen principles of Python.
It’s worth bearing in mind that what causes Python’s slower performance isn’t the fact that it’s being interpreted, it’s the fact that it’s so incredibly dynamic and everything is being indirected through about ten tables before it gets run. Compiling it won’t fix that, because it’ll just create masses of code. 
Really nice man. Keep it up. 
Check out [Effective python](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Python-Specific-Software-Development/dp/0134034287). It has a lot (59) of tips for writing better code. Use of enumerate in loops is one of them.
Native German here. Good luck learning our language. I hope you like chill in hell. :D
You want to select the directory and filename of your python executable (python.exe on windows default buried in c:\python\.... ). If you use virtual environments it's in the envs folder within your python directory. 
Javascript (ReactNative + Node) for both
Rust is nothing like python. Don't get me wrong, it's a great language, probably the best systems language available, but it's not "compiled and typed python".
Go is a possibility. It's strongly typed but has a lot of inference features, parallelisation is easy, and the syntax is pretty sane. It's still garbage collected so it's not as fast as a systems language, but it's a reasonable choice. If you haven't already, run a few of the suggestions in this thread through https://learnxinyminutes.com/

&gt;SciPy 1.0.1 is a bug-fix release with no new features compared to 1.0.0. Probably the most important change is a fix for an incompatibility between SciPy 1.0.0 and numpy.f2py in the NumPy master branch.

Read up on json.dumps() and json.loads()
That is exactly what my code was and how I was structuring it. I've been coding on and off with Python for 2 or so years but I go months and months without touching a piece of code so I have not gotten very far. As of right now I am in the process of trying to understand more advanced concepts but keep hitting roadblocks because I have been doing things structurally wrong yet didn't know because I don't really collaborate with other programmers (Python). I am still learning so apologize for the ignorance but all in all thank you for your response. It helped me understand globals a bit better.
Just write a neural net bro
I've been working, tentatively, on such a thing, although its syntax hews slightly closer to Go or C than Python for now (albeit without the bletcherousness of things like the star syntax for pointers). I'm building it using Python, actually, by way of the llvmlite library. But it's slow going, and it's forcing me to realize I don't know nearly enough about compiler design or language theory yet to make it a viable option.
That's really cool! 
Do an image classifier!
 In [1]: import json In [2]: my_dict = {'test_1': 'value one', 'test_2': 'value two'} In [3]: with open('my_file.json', 'w') as out_file: ...: json.dump(my_dict, out_file) ...: In [4]: with open('my_file.json') as in_file: ...: my_var = json.load(in_file) ...: In [5]: my_var Out[5]: {'test_1': 'value one', 'test_2': 'value two'} 
Hi there, thanks for the answer but I guess I am way too dumb to understand this json stuff. If I am correct json.load can read a file (.txt in my case) and save it in a dict I want it to be in? If yes, I don't get it running, I tried import json with open('dict.txt, 'r') as f (found the above in the web, dunno what the f stands for :X) myDictInPython = json.load(f)
If succinctness is what you're after, look into Haskell. If you're used to functional paradigms in Python like list comprehensions, you'll already have a head start in learning it. It's close to C/C++ in speed, and is statically typed.
You need to use double quotation marks to make it valid json
I believe the only reasonable answer is Cython. Why? Because it still allows access to the entire Python ecosystem while allowing you to compile the parts you care about or write yourself. I think Python as a language really is a hollow shell without the amazing libraries and community that it comes with. I think there are languages that actually have better design decisions (e.g. Clojure), but nothing comes close to Python's ecosystem.
Nice, I worked it all out, thanks for all the help guys, great sub :) (even though I am asking noob questions :X)
Come on... Don't judge a language solely by the braces. If Python had mandatory braces it would be still awesome.
I'm guessing what's happening here is that `data.loc[indices, 'TOTAL_VISITS']` creates a copy of the dataframe, on which the `inplace` operation was done. A solution would be to not use `inplace=True`. eg. `data['TOTAL_VISITS'] = data.loc[data['NUM_PRINTS'] == 1, 'TOTAL_VISITS'].fillna(5)`
Good bot.

Not using inplace operations, eg. `data.loc[indices, 'TOTAL_VISITS'] = data.loc[indices, 'TOTAL_VISITS'].fillna(5)`, seems to work.
Haskell? that mindbending language as a typed equivalent of python? lul
Ooh boy, you’re in for a world of hurt if you think any feature of Python will give you a head start in learning Haskell. 
&gt; cool, but...braces... ugh...indentation... /s
Yes, but it isn't: you can't disable the garbage collector, nor you can prevent it from allocating on the heap. There's a lot of stupid hype around go.
The question was for a language that was as succinct at Python, not necessarily the same programming style.
No, it doesn't. Go is compiled
Compiled languages can require a runtime. Java, for example.
That is indeed what happens at the C level lol.
Maybe is one word. Whats with the insults by the way? What gives you the right to call me a shithead?

This. 
&gt; The author of that book is known for his ridiculous views in the programming community, My understanding is that his ridiculous views were not suggesting people learn python 3 when it was not in mainstream use and to get angry when people complained at him for this and complaining about python 3 breaking backwards compatibility with python 2. The partial correctness of this view has been played out in the slow adoption of python 3 and the number of libraries that are written in a strange subset of python that allows code to run in python 2 and python 3. Nevertheless, I would agree with the view that Zed has a somewhat "angry" personality. I don't think this particularly affects the quality of his book and I don't feel that these views will particularly affect your quality as a programmer as you will likely be able to take what you want from the book. His book is written in an interesting style consisting solely of exercises. This may well appeal to particular learners (maybe those with a heavy maths or music background for example) while being annoyingly narrow for others. I am not sure there is another book that approaches the topic in the same way. I regard comments like the above as "the community ganging up on a dissenter" in many ways, which is the reason I am taking the time to comment. Zed didn't necessarily help himself in this regard but I don't think his opinions were *massively* wrong either. 
Compiling *with type annotations* would make it easier. Because that would make the code less dynamic. That, and in my experience, just compiling code using Cython without any annotations gives a factor of 2 or 3 speedup.

And as far the built in command handler... damn. I heard a while ago that they were working on one but didn't realize there was one already in. So this is all basically useless, lol. Thanks! 
Not sure why it would be an anti-pattern. I've found this kind of stuff useful for dynamic programming problems where some default values are needed for the 'cache', for instance. Or that some AI/ML algorithms can also use an array of random numbers as the starting 'value/weights' before training. Just some examples I can think of off of the top of my head. Maybe there are better ways to do it that I'm not aware of?
I have ported several wxPython programs from Python 2 and wxPython 3 to Python 3 and wxPython 4 with very few problems. The API changes are minor and making the code portable across releases is generally quite easy. The amount of work might depend on the code style and the age of the wx GUI code, though. 
It does not. Go can compile to a single standalone binary for damn near any architecture, modern or not.
Cool! I had a quick Google and there were a bunch of references to a runtime, which confused me, but I'll defer to you.
thanks for all the comments, it seems to me that Nim is somehow the closer thing right now. However it is still at that point in development when joining its community feels like being a very early adopter and almost a gambler (not much support in scientific programming, and a somehow instable release schedule)
This subreddit is for things related to the programming language Python, not for things related to snakes. Your comment has been removed, but if it's cute enough, you might try posting to /r/aww
I have removed this post as it is not related to Python. You have issues with Windows taking screenshots. 
&gt; I'll take things that don't belong "in the cloud" for 100 Alex. 
There IS a runtime, if you choose not to explicitly compile your code down to a binary. Basically, you can run it like a Python script: `go run foo.go`, or you can compile down into a standalone binary. The former is obviously useful for rapid iteration or CI/testing setups, and the latter is useful for deployment.
This is not a Windows problem, it is a Python question. Every version of Windows will take black screenshots in a full-screen app, because Windows does full-screen graphics differently from windowed graphics. I am essentially asking for a Python library or solution to interact with DirectX.
You're welcome to check out my book here - https://python101.pythonlibrary.org/ It's a bit different than the others. Wesley Chun has a few good books in the Core Python series. Doug Hellman wrote a good book on the standard library that you might like too.
hi definitely not interested into making games
Great, thanks a ton for your help!
Great, thank you very much!
Thank you!

Why are nested comprehensions considered bad practice? Readability?
Are you making fun of me? 😱
&gt; Not sure why it would be an anti-pattern by saying "default" values, it sounded like it might be an abuse of lists because a list is a list of values. so a default for something that already exists doesn't really make sense unless you're using the list as initialization data to be passed to class constructors. if that was the case, then setting defaults on the class level would probably make more sense in other words, the wording hinted at a violation of single responsibility and/or inversion of control but it seems it might be just a difference of terminology: &gt; Or that some AI/ML algorithms can also use an array of random numbers as the starting 'value/weights' before training I don't consider initial values to be the same as default values so if you are using the two interchangeably, for this case, i'd do something like this: blah = [random.randint(1,20) for _ in range(10)] but if you just need a list with the same scalar values: blah = [5] * 10 would work. but be careful not to do that with objects otherwise each index will point to the same object. i.e., this is bad: blah = [[]] * 10 
basically, yes
This is missing f-strings. person = {'name': 'Jean-Luc', 'height': 187.1} &gt;&gt;&gt; f'{person[height]:.0f}'
Idk, your counterexample looks much less pythonic than a nested list comprehension to me. 
Worth mentioning, `itertools.chain.from_iterable(list_of_lists)`. These cheatsheets should include more convenience from various libraries -- especially when it's a case of batteries-included.
This is most likely the one you should use if you are doing serious programming. It is also very similar to the accepted answer from the Stackoverflow question this all originates from. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16594904/python-list-comprehension-to-produce-two-values-in-one-iteration (It is also the question I originally posted this yield in list comprehension trick.)
Check out Haxe.
Very neat! I can certainly envisage a library that handles deprecation messages in a tidy way being adopted by others. I guess some libraries normally end up writing their own code for this sort of thing ([pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/eb149cea6ec976a3409f235444982f1026acbe13/pandas/util/_decorators.py) being one example): using a well-tested existing module is far easier. How do you plan to expand the functionality of the library? Options to deprecate kwargs, submodules, etc.? Whilst I enjoyed the very Zen names you've chosen for the decorators, perhaps more explicit/descriptive names might be preferred by devs who come to use the project further down the road.
With a note of it being 3.6+ only
lol what? I love rust and python, but they aren't even remotely the same. The trait system, borrowing system, lifetime, mutable/immutable declarations, and a million other things make Rust waaaay more complicated than python.
Thanks for the feedback. I'm a little confused how to implement that? I thought this was the case currently as the loops are not actually instantiated unless the variable does not already exist - they are 'if not' loops
&gt; Have you seen browser notifications on a phone? Support is on the way. Modern versions of Android have it. Apple is working on it.
Pypy is constantly almost-getting-there-not-quite a speedy Python. If it works for your needs, maybe it's what you want. I understand that compatibility with C extensions is vastly improved.
This is a great resource for everyone who is learning or needs to refresh. It's also a great resource for the nerds who know everything about everything and need a public space to assert their superior knowledge.
That's so true, especially in programming languages
Not to be nit-picky, but that's an *extensive* cheatsheet. I wouldn't call it *comprehensive*.
That made me laugh out loud
Indeed. &lt;list&gt;.append() is missing
The words "comprehensive" and "cheatsheet" should never be applicable to the same thing.
For numbers, bumpy arrays offer ones and zeros methods that give you n-dimensional arrays. For objects I personally might be tempted to just do a nested for loop. Though default dicts would give you a fairly interesting solution due to the allocation on access only.

Echoing and adding a bit to what someone else was saying, I have been developing in Python for more than 20 years, but I would not go with Python for mobile. You'll handicap yourself for no reason, because there simply isn't the amount of momentum for Python that there is for other approaches. That momentum means there is lots of code out there that you can pull in to what you want to do, less so with Python. The original JavaScript was a terrible language, but the latest versions (see Babel) are perfectly fine. I would still use Flask or Django for a server-side web app. But I'm seriously thinking now of using a client-side approach, with server-side rendering for speed and SEO. And that has led me to learning Angular 5 with Typescript. Typescript is a superset of Javascript with some extra features, most particularly, optional typing, which seems to me to be fairly similar to Python 3's optional typing. By choosing Angular over React or Vue, I'm getting a complete framework so that I don't have to bother deciding what other packages to use for routing, etc, etc.. It has server-side rendering so my project will come up in the user's browser quickly. And, with NativeScript (which works fine with TypeScript), I will also be able to use my Angular and Typescript skills to write mobile applications as well. Just my own personal thoughts, in case they may be useful.
Let's build a company ?
This is super helpful as someone that’s been away from python for a couple years now
It's actually my girlfriend's. I'm trying to help her out, but can't seem to figure it all out. If someone could provide the final code for it, I could work out the issues and help her finish it. I know some Python, but have never worked with external files. Just a bunch of turtle and widgets... Much obliged.
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython. We **highly encourage** you to re-submit your post over on there. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community is actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers. If you have a question to do with homework or an assignment of any kind, please make sure to read their sidebar rules **before** submitting your post. If you have any questions or doubts, feel free to reply or send a modmail to us with your concerns. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
1: read the sidebar 2: post in the correct subreddit 3: read THAT subreddit 4: don't post pictures of code or direction (see above) 5: we don't do your homework for you 6: at least *try* googling the problem...
This is really cool! Thanks for sharing it.
It's always interesting to get some “under the hood” explanations. Thanks for sharing!
Probably work on some open source stuff and study basic algorithms.

Excellent job, and thanks for sharing this before the current PyWeek. 
*Reads Koenig, over applies.*. One reason may be that they need to create vectorized representations of something: in many of those cases you know the dimensions of your array and just begin by initializing all the values to zero.
&gt; and adds a case statement as if we hadn't decided that if/elif is a superior way of doing things a decade ago. To me it feels that in a lot of places Nim goes backwards.
ok
Write a web scraper to get some kind of data online that gets updated then do daily graphs of it with matplotlib.
&gt;as if we hadn't decided that if/elif is a superior way of doing things a decade ago. What are some of the arguments in favor of always using if/elif exclusively over using "case"? I understand if/elif makes more sense in simple cases, but why should I want to use a chain of "if/elif" for checking 10 different possibilities of a variable (i.e. user supplied command in form of a string)? if/elif gets so long and complicated, I usually end up making a dictionary pointing to function objects and calling that. It's just so much messier than if there were just a case.
&gt;That, and in my experience, just compiling code using Cython without any annotations gives a factor of 2 or 3 speedup. Because the compiler can navigate some of those tables and convert some of those to simplified static operations.
&gt; * - My experience is a few years old now; maybe Cython actually closed the gap and is fully compatible with CPython. I rarely if ever have any compatibility issues between Cython and CPython. The only compatibility issue I know of offhand is that Cython's print doesn't work the same way, instead acting like Python2's print.
ok suggest me another sub reddit where i can share my videos for beginners
Case is awfully implicit, it's pretty much exactly the same as if/elif and introduces a bunch of unnecessary redundancy. &gt; There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Any thoughts, input, criticism are welcome. 
Ok, so note that in the README? 
That's a nice! Can I use API..for eg, Use NASA API to plot a graph of total landslides..
Yeah may be .. when i am looking at this, i look for what extra things i may get if i use this tool instead of openssl.
Ok, makes sense. I wanted to try something with sockets and SSL in native Python. Thank you for you input. 
Yeah, or sunspots, or whatever. Matplotlib has pretty good documentation too.
Er, those two aren't equivalent, and the issue isn't which one of them to use. It's that listcomps shouldn't be nested at all. (I disagree, personally, but that's what the deal is)
I can Google this, but for the sake of everyone else with the same questions, what are f-strings?
Upon further reflection, even the best use-case I can think of for case can easily be replaced by if/elif. It's not as neat or clean as case, but there's little difference.
Looks useful! Please consider using more conventional method names though (or aliases), so it’s more obvious what the code is doing..
Very interesting, thank you lots! Might you consider bringing these points up to the sanic team directly?
I didn't know about collections &gt; Counter before. I'd just write a short function to do the job
It is already there for months: https://github.com/channelcat/sanic/issues/1067
Well, to be fair, search a lot using Google (obviously) for reasonable complex Python questions (no one knows exactly what search terms trigger it, but they seem to be weighted towards ones related to statistical math, algorithms, and machine learning) during a period in which they're running it (unknown when that is, but it doesn't seem to be c) and *possibly* while physically located in the US. Not sure about that last part, but given my typical search history I should think I'd have encountered earlier than I actually did, it was only on my return to the States that it was triggered, within a short time of arrival and starting to do work searches again. Looking at [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=Google%20foo.bar) searches asking about it seem to spike regularly but not consistently, and are dominated by the US. Remove "Google" from the term and it expands to include India, S Korea and others. Might support the idea that it's geofenced in some way.
format strings that have an f in front like `f"..."`. there are also raw strings which are`r"..."`. you can also combine them to `fr"..."`
OP said "comprehensive."
Noted. Ill see what I can do this week. 
Thanks, it really does mean a lot to know that others might find your code useful outside of work.
That’s why I would always use aiohttp as an async web framework. Might lose some of the nice features included in Sanic, but it appears to be much more reliable.
?
Very roughly speaking, they eval the expressions inside the curly braces. Say, before you would write something like `print('Hello, my name is {name}'.format(name=name))` Now you can do the same thing with `print(f'Hello, my name is {name}')` Which is more concise, more readable, and overall nicer.
This was not the case for me. I did check that.
Flattening a list: import itertools flattened = [i for i in itertools.chain(list_1, list_2)] 
If you want to study the entropy of a lattice system, you'll first need to properly define the possible states at each lattice point. Then you can calculate the number of microstates that correspond to a macrostate, i.e. all the possible ways (lattice configurations) that satisfy the condition of the macrostate. For example, in an Ising lattice with a macrostate of N=9 spins with 3 up spins and 6 down spins, the number of microstates W would be "9 choose 3" = 9!/(3!6!). The entropy is then calculated from the Boltzmann equation: S = k * logW. I recommend the attached reference (pp. 1-14) detailing the Ising model for non-interacting lattice sites. You can see how the entropy of the system evolves as a function of the distribution of up and down spins in the lattice (eqn 2.18). The maximum entropy possible occurs when the system has a 50/50 distribution. However, there must be enough thermal energy (T &gt; 0) to allow the system to move towards such a macrostate for a given external magnetic field. The key point in all of this is that at any external field and temperature, the entropy will be maximized at equilibrium, which is the macrostate where the available thermal energy can't shift the spin distribution to a configuration that isn't consistent with the macrostate. (It is very improbable for it to happen). If you really want to see the evolution of the entropy dynamic, from microstate to microstate, then you'll have to perform a sampling technique, such as the Metropolis algorithm. And for any reasonable initial configuration, you'll find that the spin distribution will end up fluctuating around a set of configurations that correspond to the macrostate including the temperature and external field. https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9783319210537-c2.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-1522375-p177545420
Do what you prefer it doesn’t matter. Personally I see blockchain completely dying within 5 years. For ML, can’t say cause I’m biased as hell but hey at least Python is the perfect language for it :)
&gt;Personally I see blockchain completely dying within 5 years. Really? What makes you say that? &gt;For ML, can’t say cause I’m biased as hell but hey at least Python is the perfect language for it :) Please do elaborate :D

Thanks for your suggestions and Sorry for commenting late. I am looking for adding projects to my resumé. I'm interested in doing some machine learning project(It does NOT have to necessarily be based on ML). Your bot grabbed my attention and wanted to know what exactly it does.
How do you use these cheatsheets ? They look great but I hardly find anything useful after reading then once ? 
Awesome, thanks for the info. Will definitely have to have a go with this. I was thinking maybe I need to discretise the energy of each cell, in order to count the 'microstates', switching the analogy to spin I guess would make this a lot easier... that said, each energy has to be one of 64bits worth of possibilities... I'll read through the paper you've linked.
SURE! I'll paste it there, since I have no clue how to PM you the code. ALso made a reddit bot today wooohuuu! 
Very interesting! 
I’ll share with you some of my simulations if/when I finish them in the future.

The "Execute Command" section should mention `subprocess` instead of `Popen` IMO.
Free, reliable, efficient DB with good python API (psycopg2).
keras can use a tensorflow, theano or cntk as a backbone I think. It can really streamlines the design process. I'm starting to become a fan. 
That is right. In this example, I used Keras on top of the TensorFlow.
Google for it? Plenty of rants and articles about Mysql's many flaws.

Have you checked out PyCharm? https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
What does that mean?
Interesting, hadn't seen that before, thanks. I quite like Numba, but it does seem that requiring the type annotations would be an easier way for the developers to go, which could eventually lead to a more complete/better solution. On the other hand Numba has had real money go into it, and backing from a substantial company, and has quite a head-start, so unless the mypyc developer is extremely determined, it seems like Numba will probably continue to keep the lead... 
Reliable, stable, FOSS, not many issues when it comes to modeling data constraints compared to MySQL, enums, jsons, geodata and other extensions, better with each release, supported by a lot of tools, "explain". From what I heard, only some paid databases (MS SQL Server) have better support, but nowadays many projects would not see a difference justifying that cost.
This is exactly the kind of post I've been missing from r/python in the last year or so. Thanks for taking the time out to write it and thanks for posting! 
Oh wow I love it!! This has always been a major readability gripe of mine.
especially their mother :) Thanks
&gt; good python API (psycopg2). [This](https://magic.io/blog/asyncpg-1m-rows-from-postgres-to-python) looks like it could be an interesting alternative - the devs claim that psycopg2 has some significant performance and functionality problems. Unfortunately its asyncio only so not a simple replacement.
1. 2 is dead. Lots of projects migrated to 3, especially libraries/frameworks. 2. The "philosophical" differences are mostly down to using new features like language level type annotations/async. I guess you could also say the string/unicode type changes are "philosophical" to an extent, but well behaved 2 code should really use the same idioms as 3 here. 3. Unlikely. 2 is considered dead by just about everyone, and the ecosystem is actively moving on and dropping support for 2.x versions entirely. 4. You can't use code from one version in the other, but you can write code that works in _both_ versions fairly easily, and yes, you can have multiple versions of Python installed on any OS.
Thanks for the answers. 4 is bad news for - while it's possible to link bleeding-edge-draft C++20 to oldest ANSI C and it will just work, it makes me sad that one day I might be forced to write in Python 2 just because a project started in this version and will not be able to reuse Python 2 code from Python 3 code
This is amazing just because of Sanic 
You keep them around (or bookmarked) and if you run into a problem you first check if they provide an answer, thus possibly saving the time to either look it up or reinventing the wheel. At least that's my understanding.
[This](http://lukasz.langa.pl/13/could-we-run-python-2-and-python-3-code-same-vm/) was just posted on the subreddit - you should check it out, it explains exactly what semantic changes between 2 and 3 make it very difficult to run 2 and 3 code in the same codebase.
You do realize that the guy proposed the "python macro" for a switch/case statement if you really wanted it?
You should separate your requirements.txt and your test-requirements. It looks like none of the libraries in requirements.txt are required to use this library. It seems someone has already filed a GH issue on this.
Cool! Thanks for sharing this! 
Thanks for that. Yeah I will definitely do that asap
Good explanation. Basically duck typing makes it hard to inter-operate because only writer knows what was the exact intent
What features are you missing? I'm curious what are most important/visible/handy Sanic features not supported by aiohttp?
Thanks for the clarification! I was definitely afraid I was going to make some mistake like that - despite my efforts to get it right. Really excited to see what those changes look like in the future.
That's only 2.5 months...not really that long...
 def setUser(self, user): self.user = user You do not need to define setters in Python. Instead of using tons of instance variables you could turn the tracker into a mapping which conveniently would allow users to iterate over the tracker. Or just create and return a mapping you've build from the API. Be specific about the exceptions you would want to catch instead of just catching them all. In general I wouldn't put code like the Tracker class in \_\_init\_\_.py. &gt; self.parsed["stats"]["p9"] Just assigned it to a variable like all_squad so you don't repeat yourself as much. BTW top1-25, kd code blocks could easily be factored out in a method and would make tracker.get_stats a lot more succinct. Regarding the first six lines of tracker.get_stats which variables *need* to be instance variables and which are *only* used locally? Not every variable in a class *has* to be an instance variable.
Please elaborate
PostgreSQL is one of the best DB available, and it's also free. It can do some things Oracle can't (like changing the database schema in a transaction; to be fair, there are some things Oracle can do Postgres isn't that great at), and it's written by very smart people. Some years ago, Postgres gained the ability to treat foreign databases (or JSON files etc.) as tables and run queries on them. Just for fun, somebody wrote a MongoDB driver and ran some queries. Most queries were of course a little bit slower than when using the native MongoDB, but complex queries were actually faster; Postgres' query optimizer did a better job than MongoDB's (to be fair, this was years ago and MongoDB seems to have improved in that regard). Nowadays you can even use it like a schemaless database ("NoSQL"), while still having the advantages of ACID. There was a talk by one of Reddit's engineers talking about "lessons learned". On particular thing was that Reddit had problems with everything: AWS, Postgresql drivers, Pylons (the framework Reddit is written in), performance, but there was one thing they had never any issues with: PostgreSQL itself. It was the only thing in Reddit's tech stack that never had any issues. I've been using Postgres for over 10 years now in critical production projects and to date never had any issue where Postgres was the problem. It really is one of the most high quality, high reliability systems I've ever come across (be it FOSS or proprietary). The performance is also very good. Some people experience with Big Data often say that if you have anything up to a few TB of data, Postgres is fine, only if you have tens of TB of data do you see advantages in "Big Data" software.

Ah well, it seems the trouble was I was doing this in a Jupyter qtconsole. If I run it in a browser-based notebook it works fine. Back to your lives, citizens, and I'll squirm back under my rock.
OK, will try, but I almost always find it easier to check the first google result(StackOverflow). 
There are JupyterLab: a web-based IDE to handle data science asserts.. https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyterlab-is-ready-for-users-5a6f039b8906
I think you'd run into some errors. But using virtualenv would solve that. 
asyncpg is brilliant when you're doing asyncio stuff (and it sees a solid amount of use there already, so I wouldn't call it a "could be"!) but you definitely want to use psycopg2 for synchronous applications — that is, there's no in polluting an otherwise-synchronous application with `loop.run_until_complete`s to use asyncpg
Maybe its completely coincidental but Sanic usually is a bastardization of Sonic the Hedgehog who goes fast.
Seems very useful. I am using multiple string distance metrics, and most are implemented here. I am missing trigram distance though. How would you implement it using this lib? (Jaccard distance on the sets of trigrams)
Thats why virtualenv was created. Sudo apt-get install virtualenv cd /source/project virtualenv &lt;nameofenv&gt; -p &lt;version of python you want&gt; 
ITT: people, who thing the article title is a question :)
As someone who has to look up `json.dumps` and `json.loads` all the time (even with frequent use), I concur!
Why not just use the builtin `diff` command?
Using `tox` and unittesting, I can test that it works in both Python 2 and Python 3.
Why is there a `bool_` type? Shouldn't it be bool? &gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy as np &gt;&gt;&gt; ary = np.array([0, 1]) &gt;&gt;&gt; ary.astype(np.bool_) array([False, True], dtype=bool) &gt;&gt;&gt; ary.astype(np.bool) array([False, True], dtype=bool)

It's deliberate ;)
Well, streaming responses were added to Sanic at 2017-05-05. Almost a year ago. Is it long enough? Or maybe the feature was not used in production for almost a year? I have no idea.
Sanic is not a self-made "webserver" but a web framework like Django or Flask but asynchronous (like Tornado).
To be clear, you also can’t write Python 3.6 features in a Python 3.5 program in the exact same way you can’t use C++17 features in a C++14 compiler. You always have to code to the environment that you’re building in; C++ just allows you to link in prebuilt object code (but you can’t send C++ objects to that code because the language does not specify an ABI).
I thought so. It just makes stuff a bit more fun when you can talk about stuff like that.
Thanks for responding. I am aware of Jupyterlab but it has a number of things missing like variable inspector, code completion in text editor, etc that I find to be useful.
There's a very good and comprehensive migration guide [here](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/practical-python-porting/). It covers very well your last question, since it contains probably everything you need to know about the technical side of porting to 3 or supporting both.

Python 2 is a better language, but a lot of propaganda made it seem like Python 3 is the winner. In a nutshell, v2 is simple, while v3 is over-engineered and highly internally inconsistent. Its flagship implementation is slower, and while Python 2 wasn't known for its speed, the situation only gets worse. Will Python 2 continue as a separate language? - Very unlikely, the difference is not that big. Besides, there are many alternatives: if you are free to choose the language, and you still need to rewrite your old Python 2 code, and you aren't constrained to specific modules you have to use / your project manager's taste, there's no reason to choose Python 3. Depending on your tastes and use case, there are better options for everything Python is used for today. But, if you must port Python 2 to Python 3, it's typically not very difficult. Neither Python 3 nor Python 2 can execute all code written for the different version, there is, however, a large subset that is executable in both. Finding the right interpreter version for your code is a big problem. On one hand, you want to allow running your code with the interpreter the user already has, on the other hand, Python is very picky about what that interpreter can do. So, if, like in your example, you did `#/usr/bin/python3` you might be up for surprises... like, for example, `python3` may mean `python3.5` or `python3.6`, and something innocuous like `{'x': 1}.keys()[0]` will or will not raise an error. On top of that, that style of shebang comment doesn't guarantee that your interpreter will be able to find installed libraries, because Python ecosystem evolved in the same direction as prehistorical Java: everyone installs their dependencies wherever they want, no centralized management. 
I don’t understand what it is useful for :-/

Wouldn't textdistance.jaccard(qval=3).distance(*sequences) fit your needs?
Is [jellyfish](https://github.com/jamesturk/jellyfish) no longer active development?
To run every x days use the system tooling with your OS, so if running on Linux look into Cron, if running on Windows look into the Task Scheduler. Alternatively you could make it a daemon/system service, but idk how to do that properly. 
I wonder if this would be useful for game engines where Python is used for scripting but where devs would like to create a more user friendly scripting language for modding and such.
It is, and according to https://github.com/jamesturk/jellyfish, it last saw a commit a little over a month ago. The last [PyPI release](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jellyfish), however, was in mid-2016. I'd argue that a library like this probably doesn't need super regular releases, though.

&gt; Python 2 is dying, we are slow to kill it and the process was ugly and bloody but it’s a one way street Long live Python2! https://github.com/naftaliharris/tauthon/
This post is better suited for r/learnpython 
&gt; Its flagship implementation is slower, and while Python 2 wasn't known for its speed, the situation only gets worse. Have a look at https://twitter.com/llanga/status/963834977745022976 and https://speed.python.org/comparison/ Performance always depends on what you're doing, so anything saying Python 3 is faster or slower is always a simplification. It's slower at some things, faster at some others. Early versions of Python 3 did sacrifice a fair bit of performance - since then, various changes have made different operations faster. I guess you heard at some point that 'Python 3 is slow' and have assumed that never changed.
The first paragraph reminds me of [this](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~wklieber/python-tail-recursion.jpg) and the fact that while Python has many not-so-typical features (eg reference counting instead of GC where possible) it's implementation still has a lot to improve, including optimizing tail recursion Are you saying that Python 2 is more *pythonic* than Python 3?
To be precise, you can't use Python 2 and 3 in the same process. It's still possible to have them running at the same time on the same system and exchanging data using things like files/pipes/sockets. Depending on what you're trying to do, this could be an easy workaround, or it could be not practical at all.
Thanks! I really appreciate the feedback. Thanks for checking it out. I think you're right about the title. Pretty bummed about the downvotes. Looking a little better now though 😁
I made pure python implementation for good compatibility with any systems and simpler code reading. In future releases i want add optional requirements, like your library, for transparent usage. Now some algorithms already have two realizations: independent and with numpy usage (if numpy already installed). 
&gt; Good luck with that. Good luck converting all the Python2 code in production to Python3 ;-)
Would a numba decorator, instead of Cython, also decrease execution time?
nicola, pelican. 
My guess is yes, but I don't know by how much since I've never personally used numba.
To your second point (simpler code reading), Cython has its own syntax for some things (e.g., static typing), but it doesn't really reduce code readability at all. For the most part, Cython code looks just like Python code.
Trying to finish up the movement and collision detection in my game to no avail. The collision detection has me stumped. Can't figure out what I am doing wrong :'(
I edited my comment after your first comment. Did you happen to read it before your second reply?
I am making a game right now using Pygame. I could see myself doing game dev as a hobby but not an actual full time job. I want to get into machine learning and data science. That's where my real interest lies. However, I found that making games at the start of your learning experience when you are new can actually be benifitial as it teaches you basic code concepts and you can see the results visually.
Lektor might work
I think about continuing to Jellyfish for more algorithms, but I want made common and simple interface. In future I plan to integrate jellyfish into my project if any algorithm realizations will be faster.
&gt; I would think it comes under the general readability and maintainability guidelines. That's why it is considered bad practice because it is less readable and more difficult to maintain
What's wrong with the jellyfish API?
Thanks. 
I'm curious why you specifically want a generator in python? (I realize this is the python subreddit.) It seems Jekyll is the defacto static site generator for github pages and has a number of available templates and themes. I've used the "Minimal Mistakes" template (largely because it seemed to include the most available features) and the learning curve wasn't too steep. Most templates will work out of the box and will just require config file changes to get various layouts and designs. Some templates will probably be more "cookie cutter"-ish while others are more flexible. 
&gt; I'm curious why you specifically want a generator in python I don't like to maintain a repo written in Ruby as I'm not familiar with the language and ecosystem. Seeing the suggestions from other users and checking out the options, I observed that not many ready themes are available on Python static site generator. I'm also considering to try out https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/ (written in JS). My goal is to start a travel blog (many picture files and low text data). Would you recommend any theme/generator with good visual?
My [response](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/875eue/comment/dwams12?st=JF8HP5PT&amp;sh=ec2d711f) to a similar comment 
Even though this is a joke I honestly live by this and believe it does have many benefits. Drunk me is way less likely to stare at my screen blankly frozen with anxiety about structure and cross-platform compabaility and future proofing. Drunk me will just open a blank file and start coding which is what you really need sometimes especially when starting something new. Sober me can come in later and clean up the rough edges and refine work that's already mostly done. 
I think the recently open sourced snips platform might be a good option. https://medium.com/snips-ai/an-introduction-to-snips-nlu-the-open-source-library-behind-snips-embedded-voice-platform-b12b1a60a41a https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation Look at the other repos under the organization.
I'm not particularly familiar with Ruby either and have never actually needed to look at the underlying code (except out of pure curiousity). Also, haven't needed to mess with the CSS. I'm not going to say that there isn't a learning curve--but it is probably about the same as it would be for any other templating type engine. Maybe even less than many because it seems to be used quite a bit and have a large community. For minimal mistakes at least most setup/design can be done with pretty straightforward html-esque templates (with some looping and output tag type stuff). And on top of that easily integrates with a number of external commenting systems and similar crud.
&gt; anybody who isn't deluded by unhealthy dose of Pythonism would find it hard to see why that's even a problem LOL... exactly! I work in many different languages - best tool for the job - and the majority of them support some sort of case (in addition to IF/ELSE)... it's almost like *everyone except Python* agrees they have their place and are useful.
One of the BEST app search launcher I have used is Synapse (on linux)
I see, I also honestly don't know the difference, was just wondering because it always says "bool" if you check the dtype. Just looked around and it seems that np.bool_ is a built-in type and np.bool is just an alias for Python's bool. I think that eventually both result in the same "bool" dtype though when used for casting an array to bool. 
It's harder than it looks. What methods are you using? I think Minkowski Portal Refinement is pretty popular. 
Honestly, I think it looks pretty good as-is. Good parameterization, separation of concerns, etc. The fact you’re even asking this question shows that, unlike most messy scripts, you clearly gave a crap about the organization scheme.
I'm just using standard rects. The problem I am having is when my player hits a wall he ends up running through it shortly after.
That’s somewhat misleading. Yes, Cython can take unmodified Python and provide a marginal speed up in most cases. I’m certain there’s a tiny smattering of edge cases where that’s all it takes. However, most production uses of Cython look like this: https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop/blob/master/uvloop/handles/tcp.pyx It’s far from the Python tree. Which makes sense given that Cython use cases focus on needing performance far more than readability. I’m fine with Cython. Not fine with people conflating it with Python. They have different use cases, different code styles (more C oriented, LBYL over EAFP, often takes pains to avoid extra allocations, etc). Good tech, but let’s not get carried away.

Is there a library, like this or jellyfish, that also includes Unicode homoglyph similarity (like the 'confusable_homoglyphs' library)?
My reply works for your immediately preceding post of &gt; basically yes 
&gt; Good news: Sanic development team runs so fast that new backward incompatible changes can land into master without any deprecation period and related procedures. The sarcasm. I can sense it
Any old text editor would work. There's gedit that is installed on Ubuntu (and others) by default, you could install sublime, atom, .... Of course there are terminal alternatives like emacs or Vim (my personal editor) that have proven to be great editors, although you might need some time to learn to work with! ;) The fact that you run programs from the command line does not mean you need to write it in your terminal! Although you can, and there are a lot of people out there doing it that way! :)
Why LGPL? 
You can mess around with `%` as well. `1234 % 10 == 4` `123 % 10 == 3` etc. 
thanks % and while loop :) 
Yes. My company takes people on from all over the world, presuming they can get a visa (Ireland.) People on my team from Croatia, Boliva, Greece, Argentina etc.
Of course, that's what I meant... Python will be the main thing I need. The thing is, how to use Python and in how many different ways. That's why I asked. Thanks for your message!
Atom is really great! With the hydrogen kernel development is straight forward 👍🏻
https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#divmod
Nice ones thanks
I like the Spyder IDE included in Anaconda.
Python is just pseudo code you can test
I recommend emacs. Graphical capabilites to highlight with mouse as well as more commands than you could possibly learn, extensible to have functionality like an IDE if you want that, and FOSS. I also prefer the commands of emacs to vi/vim for basic text editing commands, as I think they're more ergonomic. Random example, `Cx Cs` for saving a buffer to a file, as opposed to vi's `:w enter`, or copying and pasting. And I don't like having to exit command mode by reaching up to escape like in vi. I just vi for random file configurations or quick script editing, but prefer emacs for longer scripts/programs or documents, like with python or latex. 
Hands down vs-code
VScode and PyCharm
I would not care too much about what he is saying, to be honest. The speed part is factually wrong (and typical of a fear-mongering propaganda approach, while he complains about propaganda). Over-engineered doesn't mean much without more details, which he conveniently doesn't provide. Internal inconsistency ? I don't know, having to import another open() function from codecs in order to specify encoding was not very consistent in python2... Tail recursion will not be optimized, see [here](http://neopythonic.blogspot.de/2009/04/tail-recursion-elimination.html) for the thoughts about the author of python on this topic.
Yeah, that happens. Try adding this at the top of your file #pylint: disable=E1101 
Why use CPUs instead of GPUs as indicated in https://www.pcgamer.com/vacnet-csgo/ ?
Send that you're setting the entity's rect coordinates when dealing with collision rather than the entity's position, which would be a calculated offset based on the rect

Yes, start your app as its own daemon and configure the webservers to forward requests. HTTP is one way, but I've used all kinds of protocols to make webservers talk to WSGI servers over the years: * FastCGI * AJP * uWSGI * HTTP Any of these works fine so go with whichever you can make work most easily. Async frameworks most often speak just HTTP though.
similar (or possibly the same?) use case is "fuzzy" term matching when implementing search. The user can mistype or misremember exact words and you're still able return a list sorted by how "close" the user's search term matches the terms in the database.
Yeah, pretty much the same. I was correcting a search term that didn't return any matches to a word that was actually in the help system.
amazing 
https://inoxoft.com/ based in Lviv Ukraine. its the business. 
You could do two httpd instances, one with Python3 and the other with Python2, running on different ports, rather than having each site running as a separate webserver, but you won't be able to run each site in a different virtualenv if you go down that route. As long as different stuff is running in the same process, there's not going to be a wall of separation between them. To have completely separate virtualenvs, you'll basically need a different Python process for each site, however you do it.
The point about all of these is that you don't really need to worry about the underlying mechanics, just the content. We're looking at Jekyll and can only spell Ruby.
it it be better than conda?
Gunicorn is a good pick. Uwsgi is harder to configure (the documentation is frequently baffling) but it has some useful features for production use like being able to recycle a worker when its memory use gets too high. I really learned to hate mod_wsgi when I found out that it does dumb shit like drop requests that are being processed during a graceful reload of httpd. Combined with the suffering that is httpd's configuration, I'm all too happy to leave it behind. There's no reason you can't use gunicorn or another wsgi app server with httpd and mod_proxy, but consider taking a look at nginx instead.
I am a heavy emacs user, and I do support the argument that it has full IDE capabilities (even more so for LaTeX users), but I couldn't help giggling with the example. I'm not sure anyone would find that `C-x C-s` is a *natural* command (`:w enter` isn't much more natural, for that matter). I like the emacs way, and I now find the commands almost natural and logic, but we should admit that there is some learning curve.
Did you make this from scratch or modify code. I've messed with Tic Tac Toe in Python before but never thought to add it to my CV. 
I think you posted about your VM problems in the wrong forum.. VMware and virtualbox are competitors.. I also use Virtualbox extensively. Had a lot of issues because I messed up some small settings(bridge networking). Remember to clone and backup your VM at regular intervals. If you do that you can get back to speed quickly. If you cant, you may end up spending a lot of time, trying to reconfigure everything.
Sure. While vi takes learning a few commands to ever type a sentence, Emacs has a tutorial as soon as you start it, and a graphical interface with buttons. So really it's easier to get started than with vi, but the learning curve to perform more advanced commands or whatever definitely increases beyond that. I'm still learning emacs myself, having mostly used vi before.
They're two different things. PyPi/Warehouse is a package repository, conda is a package installer. Conda can use PyPi and/or the Anaconda Repository. Conda vs pip is a more even comparison.
Spam referral link Actual link for those interested: https://www.humblebundle.com/books/makerspace-books
FWIW. It is actually Apache which is the cause of the dropped requests because of the way it handles managed processes. The mod_wsgi module can't do much about it.
Thank you for clarification, much appreciated. I normally use conda for installation, since I installed miniconda in my machine.

How would a proper solution look in code ?
See this recent HackerNews post: [Avoid Else, Return Early (2013)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16678209) Essentially, - Functions - Return statements
Not strictly relevant to the OP, but for production purposes, the [regex module](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/regex/2018.02.21) (an alternative to `re`) supports a sophisticated "fuzzy match" option. You can specify exactly how many inserts, deletes, or changes you permit in a target string to "match" the source string. Since it is implemented in C, it should be a good alternative to implementing one of these algorithms in pure Python.
and how is the interview or first contact process? do i have to send my cv to the job im applying and thats it? and for the language im guessing that some companys want people who speak perfect english and others just want someone who is understandable
I never said all. I said "widely considered" to be bad practice. And it's not some rule I just made up out of thin air because I don't like something. 
Helped me sort out and repair OCR software errors. Edit distances are surprisingly useful. Has application in genetics research also. &gt; In bioinformatics, it can be used to quantify the similarity of DNA sequences, which can be viewed as strings of the letters A, C, G and T. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance 
Wow, somehow have never come across converters. Very helpful, thanks!

We use GPUs for training, but CPUs for inferencing. Our networks aren't big enough to need to do GPU all the time. That could change, of course.
I want know where my library is used. Just for statistics. No any reasons. But GPL is very strict. You can recommend me any more free license with this condition. 
I'm just slightly confused why we don't have a separate keyword syntax for this. We got `async stmt` and `await` for asyncio...why aren't we getting `dataclass` as a keyword whose class statement allows the same parameters as the decorator?
Yeah, in future I will add optional dependencies for good performance. But only optional. If environment has no any known side packages then my package will be use pure python implementation. This is good for simple installation on any platforms. 
GitHub: https://github.com/billcccheng/instagram-terminal-news-feed
&gt; Func fact: C++ commitee do not consider language to be overengineered. That's irrelevant to Python which is not run by a C++ committee. Perl devs consider Perl to be readable. Python has a different philosophy of trying to make things consistent, readable, and straightforward. What those mean varies based on the person, but it's a fundamental goal of the language and the Python devs go out of their way to do that.
$179 a month ouch. With only a 14 day trial. Nope
This is exactly what I've been looking for.

You can just make a properly designed framework. For example, aiohttp has no such problems under the hood.
Pythonista is the only way. You can not develop native apps with Python, but Pythonista does expose some OS APIs FWIW.
Why not?
It works. But for pandas with date time I found a lamda function with pd.to_datetime (x) works well. 
&gt; This is my first time using linux and pytorch (And virtual machines) Do you already have a favorite IDE/text editor? If you do, it's probably better to investigate how good its python support is
Incredible project, not too sure how to authenticate when Instagram's 2FA is on. I know Reddit lets you sign in with &lt;password&gt;:&lt;2FA code&gt;, but can't seem to find anything similar for Instagram :(
I feel that OP isn't going to delete the app and use this, it's more a small feel good project to practice using Python?
I'm also fairly new to python, but I did try PyCharm for a while on windows, so I might check that out. 
Thank you all for your answers, I'll make sure to check these out!
I going to have to think about the 2FA part. Not an easy task.
You're hired.
How does it currently work with the decorator? Whatever that is. Same way.
Reminds me of using Veronica / gopher. Simpler times my friends.
The module can be written in C without being a keyword. Adding a keyword like this will also break backwards compatibility. Slumping inherited classes and dataclass arguments into the same statement makes code less readable. I don’t see how adding a keyword like this is a good idea, consider `attrs`is also a popular option.
Best UI i've seen in months.
wow, this is bad ass!
Probably not. For AR/VR you want to be hitting high frame rates. Roughly 60fps for AR and 90fps for VR You'll be struggling to hit those frame rates in an engine managed in python. You'll often have to drop down to at least some form of shader language. Why not use a game engine like unity or Godot instead?
This post is better suited for r/learnpython 
Cmon man... `pipenv run python3 start.py` This is super sick by the way. Amazingly creative idea!
Even if you're running your logic every frame, python is slow enough that you'd be struggling to hit that frame rate. If you check out Godot, its language is very similar to python but more performant
Starred! Badass project my friend!
Gimmick at best but hey whatever floats your boat 
Thank you ! I will look into it 
Thanks for the feedback. How would I move the tracker class out of __init__? 
Bravo
Just create a tracker.py file in that folder and put the code in it.
Yes you can leave it empty.
Ok I will try that now
It looks like a fun coding project to me, absolutely no real-world use but probably interesting to make.
Ok thanks re posted there!
sanic is so fast that it handles 21 requests in [TechEmpower benchmark](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r15&amp;hw=ph&amp;test=plaintext) or maybe server responses so fast that client can not handle all responses :)

Do they have app specific passwords? 
Have you considered adding a [sixel](https://github.com/saitoha/PySixel) option? It's another option for displaying images in a terminal :)
Bro. Terminology. `tycat`. There are ways to have images rendered in a terminal. 
577 doesn't exist. Can you give a direct link?
Right, but if couroutines were first implemented via a decorator in asyncio, and then made built in via a statement, why can't the same be done with this arguably different type of object model in comparison to other classes and objects use for all other possible OOP applications?

Why don't you have an alias for python=python3???? Why does this bother me so much??? Whhhyyyyyy?!?!
You can use [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/index.html) and [basemap](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/). The [basemap gallery](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/examples.html) shows samples of what you can do.
Lol I don't either

Which part of the discussion, it goes on quite a bit across multiple locations?
True, Python devs basically try to do [this](https://pics.me.me/all-riaht-qentlemen-we-need-a-way-to-change-this-29134757.png)
You conflate *standards* with *best practice* and *suggestions. There is a level of competence in Python that includes some use of nested comprehensions. Why not try and attain that rather than force others who don't work with you, to stop at your level of competence? What is or isn't deemed Pythonic should not become a drive to the lowest common denominator. 
So this video doesn't actually show any alternatives (unless you consider writing everything manually an "alternative" to `dataclasses`). I'd expect to see at least `collections.namedtuple`, `typing.NamedTuple` and `attrs`. Raymond Hettinger has made a [talk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/7tnbny/raymond_hettinger_python_37s_new_data_classes/) (unfortunately, removed from youtube) better explaining dataclasses, their predecessors and alternatives (although even his talk misses `attrs`).
`asyncio` came in Python 3.4 without `async` and `await` keywords. It was necessary to decorate a function with `@asyncio.coroutine` instead of defining it with `async def` and use `yield from` (already existing syntax) instead of `await`. This is a pretty common idiom, to introduce new things without changing syntax too much if you can, but if these new things become popular and there are cases in which a new syntax would be better - then a new syntax is introduced.
This may not be the instagramm we need but it is the instagramm we deserve...
Eastern Europe is a good place to work in programming. If you are a EU citizen, check out Poland (Krakow, Warsaw, Breslau). Lots of big companies are putting their back office there. In minor measure also Budapest and Prague are worth a look.
`ones()` suggests that you are using NumPy or a library based on it, i.e. some Python module written in C. And this module isn't written well. My guess is that somewhere it doesn't verify that the value returned by `malloc` is not `NULL` or something like that. How can you verify that? Well, I've never tried this on Mac, but on Linux, my course of action would be like this: 1. Run `gdb`. 2. In `gdb` console, execute `r python path/to/my/script script arguments`. 3. Let it crash and see the line / function name it crashes. 4. Re-run `gdb` again, but this time before issuing `r python ...`, set break point on the line / in the function where the program crashes. 5. Use various `gdb` commands to investigate the state of the stack, the values of local variables etc. 6. Maybe (but very unlikely) this will give you some insight as to how you could possibly avoid this problem. Although, if the problem is that `malloc` fails to allocate enough memory, it is possible that the only way to solve this would be to buy more physical memory... 7. Finally, send a bug report to the maintainers of the library in which the offending function resides so that they learn to verify the values of their variables and instead of crashing, would raise a Python error.

If you are on Linux, maybe try running `xev` and see what does pressing `C-S-6 x` actually sends? For me, this combination translates into something that is some accented ASCII character, hardly an escape sequence for telnet.

Great, thank you very much for your advice. It’s strange as the variable passed into the function is the same as another variable ( just with slightly different values) which works fine in that function. I’ll try out your suggestions. 
More importantly, that's an admin
&gt; Yes, different needs. You cannot overload in python (not the traditional oop way I mean), another design choice which looks strange to many coming from c++/java Lack of overloading in Python is not strange for me. I would rather be surprised if Python had this feature. What's the point of overloading if language heavily promotes duck typing? It wants you to have 1 overload for everything. Adding overloading would defeat the purpose and likely add confusing deduction rules. On the other hand, for people coming from typical high-level C-like languages overloading in C++ is much more complex. You can even overload by `const`,`volatile` or referenceness. At maximum abuse I tried for I reached 16 different overloads of the same function, all taking 1 and the same `Foo` argument. Trying to call all these overloads was another exercise... &gt; This is interesting, and at the same time it makes sense. The goal is to give the advanced programmers maximum control over everything. Of course that will require a complex and extensive set of features. That's pretty much the core language design. Powerful (ideally zero-overhead) abstractions. You don't pay for what you don't use, and so many C++ projects often resign from RTTI and exceptions, because nothing really requires them to exist - just optional convenience-performance feature tradeoff. The same core aim for Rust. The only difference is that C++ was incrementaly build based on C while Rust started from scratch without intent to provide backwards compability. Some people asked if C++ could do something like Python 2 =&gt; 3 move but creators replied that Rust and D are already there.

&gt;Did you care to look at Python object structure, in Python 2 and Python 3? No. &gt; Python 2 had much smaller objects. How did this happen? Well, Python 2 didn't care that much about API consistency, so, quite often some "dunder" methods weren't implemented by some objects in standard library, which, in turn, made them smaller. Python 3 tried to make this situation more uniform by adding "dunder" slots in many places, but it made objects bigger. Right now it seems like a good thing to me, so maybe you forgot to mention something that somehow would turn having more dunder methods into a bad thing ? &gt; Python 3 requires writing a lot more code for solving the same problems because of the bad decisions made in design of string data structure. Programs that need to do string manipulations will thus, in general be bigger and slower in v3 if compared to v2. No. You talk about bytes/string confusion. It used to be that you had this type, it was called string, but really it was bytes, and python tried to decode it instead of showing the bytes, but then you could not really specify the encoding, so it failed all the time unless you're only dealing with ascii (but being in europe, non-ascii characters are an everyday thing for me), so then you had to use the u-strings, but no one used them, and if you had another encoding then fuck you. Now you have a string type that deals with strings, and you can use any encoding for that string, and a bytes type that deals with bytes. How on earth do you find that worse, I don't know. More information [here](http://python-notes.curiousefficiency.org/en/latest/python3/questions_and_answers.html#what-actually-changed-in-the-text-model-between-python-2-and-python-3). They also talk about why your lower cat example, while valid, is not a representative example. &gt; Python eliminated small integers, again, resulting in higher memory footprint when doing trivial math. Lol for real. Sure, if you talk about it this way, and not like this : "we removed the obnoxious int/long confusion, everything is a long now, and ints will never suddenly become longs anymore"... Not to mention the difference is going from 24 to 28 bytes, and if that really matters to your code, you can use libs that implement C-style ints. It's definitely a good thing to me that core python uses one and only one python int that will work in more than 99% of the cases. &gt; Here are some more thoughts about over-engineering: http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2016/10/30/i-dont-understand-asyncio/ (if you search this blog further, you will find an example where author reimplements cat program in Python 2 and Python 3 to show how much more code will have to be written in Python 3. I KNEW it had something to do with Armin :) To be clear I have huge respect for the guy, I use Flask a lot, and he knows what he talks about. The thing is, many people read his blog (for good reasons), and draw the wrong conclusions. Namely, "python 3 sucks!" instead of "here are the issues I encountered with python3, let's discuss them". Yeah, no one claimed that python was perfect, and it was indeed slower in early 3, but now 2 is no match in terms of speed, and also in terms of consistency (xrange, izip, itervalues... Like, come on...).

hi a bot
Have you tried this sequence? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6248766/how-to-enter-the-escape-characters-for-telnet-programmatically
Made it from scratch
I'm not sure why you're so offended. I didn't say you couldn't use them
Well, if you didn't read, but you still argue about it... do you really want me to second-hand relay to you what's written in CPython source code? "Dunder" methods are fields in the `type` struct. The more you add, the bigger it gets. What Python core developers did is known as http://wiki.c2.com/?ShlemielThePainter Shlemiel The Painter. The problem isn't quadratic in its nature, but Python core devs made it quadratic, instead of linear. This is stupid and they deserve to be laughed at. So, what's wrong exactly? Well, you see... The core problem here is that Python core devs want to add more syntax features. Because it sells the language better to its users. Every new release they have new feature X, which... often needs to be implemented by means of adding "dunder" methods. However, this is a solved problems. Back in the 60s, it was solved in Lisp by using macros: you need new syntax, use the same language to define the syntax - problem solved. The code needed to solve the problem is linearly proportional to the problem. Python core developers never had a good foresight into how languages might evolve, what features will be needed in the future, which will prove to be useless, but because of how these features were implemented, there was neither a way to go back and undo them, nor the way to develop them in separation... And this is how Python is gotten into the mess of Python 3, with ever increasing number of "dunder" methods. &gt; No. You talk about bytes/string confusion. It used to be that you had this type, it was called string, but really it was bytes, and python tried to decode it instead of showing the bytes, but then you could not really specify the encoding, No, you are confused. Strings and bytes are the same thing. What you call strings are more complex things. I will call them "string object" for the lack of better word. Python, as is common with its core developers royally screwed up here. They misunderstood at which level they need to put their abstractions. You see... string objects, as manipulated by application don't need to be arrays of bytes, with emphasis on them being arrays, no matter the type of array. Arrays don't handle concatenation, insertion, and deletion well, but this is often the operations required. There are other data structures which perform much better under these conditions. This has been known since at least the time Perl was created. A common way to implement strings for languages that do a lot of string manipulation is to use `rope` data structure, for example. Python screwed up here because instead of going all the way to make strings that are good for applications and use streams / arrays of characters where they needed, it decided to replace arrays of characters with strings, but because it didn't work very well, they settled for some middle ground, where now their strings are garbage, because their implementation is dog slow, because they need to be arrays, but they need to be arrays because they are forced as a replacement for where you'd actually want to have arrays... &gt; Lol for real. Yes, for real. My primary language is Common Lisp. It has better implementation of mathematics than Python ever will, and yet it has something it calls `fixnum`, which is a small size integer. Why does it have it? - It's an optimization technique. If you don't care about optimization, you may forget it's there, the language handles it for you by using the correct type when it can identify a good use case. It's not always smart enough to know that the program won't generate numbers that won't fit into `fixnum` size, to it may be conservative about it, and the programmer will need to force this constraint on it. You just had crappy numeric type system in Python from the get go, but removing `long` / `int` distinction didn't make it better. It's a lame marketing trick at best. I don't think much about the author of this blog. I find it funny though that he's also the author of `click` library, which is a fantastic piece of garbage and a display of complete misunderstanding of how locales work and what they are meant for (it's most prominent use is in `pipenv`, which is another fantastic piece of garbage). Yes, Python 3 tried to unify some things, but it created new inconsistencies. `range()` creates an object which can be subscripted, but no other iterator in standard library does that. Some top level functions take generators as arguments as well as, say, lists, others only take lists. The proliferation of "dunder" methods created a lot of similar looking but actually distinct structures. Try sticking `async x for x in y` into every other place, where you can fit `x for x in y` and see how far do you go. And the list goes on, I just need to get some lunch, so I won't continue it.

Instagram has a very difficult process for getting an API key
Looking for a Python developer for an appraisal app. We are taking over an existing app from a previous developer and would like to work with someone on a project basis for this one specifically with a product manager and CTO. Initial engagement is a 4 week project to plug the holes before negotiating a full time arrangement. Please PM for details.

If I can summarize your post: "whenever I need things for my job to work, I need Linux, but when I want to look at pictures of cats on Instagram, Mac seems to be better". It's a very tough choice you are faced with. I cannot really tell you one way or another.
Okay thanks, I move it there then.

Not everything has to be functional. Even programmers can do things for fun

Have a look at the BeeWare project: https://pybee.org/
Not always lists: a, b, c = (True,) * 3 print('=' * 40)
No direct replacement that I know of, though many of these could be computed in a straightforward way with scipy. librosa[https://librosa.github.io/librosa/], yaafe[http://yaafe.sourceforge.net/] and pyaudioanalysis[https://github.com/tyiannak/pyAudioAnalysis] are the toolkits to look at. Of them, I've found librosa to be the most usable. You might have to implement this yourself using scipy, if you want exactly comparable results. The main question how specan is estimating "fundamental frequency" (via harmonic product spectrum, maybe?) and "dominant frequency" (just the peak?); the remainder of the calculations are fairly straightfoward.
now for full color ansi so it's like... Instagram BBS
I know this is made in jest, but for the sake of correctness, that code actually has a bug. If the combination is 1000001 it won't find the passcode. random.randint(a, b) will return a random integer in the [a, b] range, both included. So random.randint(0, 5) will return any from [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] range(a, b) will return the list of numbers in the range [a, b), up to b but not including it. So range(0, 5) will return [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] So the loop will never get to 1000001 :)
Wow. I’m just starting to learn python along side my normal Middle School classes. I can’t imagine accomplishing a feat like this. Well done.
This is so cool you should integrate https://dereenigne.org/linux/vlc-caca-ascii-output/ next!
y tho
That isn't something you should alias easily. If some tools in your operating system expect python to point to the python2 executable they might stop working.
I’ve been using this site: https://cscircles.cemc.uwaterloo.ca. It gives good explanations and then has quick graded exercises. It’s nice because it’s in a browser but they also have resources for running python in your own pc. There’s also practicepython.org, which gives explanations and problems which you then solve on your own. 
Please check our sidebar and r/learnpython 
Yeah it replies. Not well enough yet but sends a basic message that states that it was interpreted as spam.
It’s mostly about learning how to build and use reusable pieces so that you yourself don’t have to do everything alone. So for example, Instagram has an “API” which just means you can access its data over the web’s HTTP protocol. That’s great because it means you don’t have to figure out how to talk to Instagram from scratch but you can just import a standard web library to talk to it. Ditto for opening the images. Since they’re all normal JPEG files you can use a normal JPEG library. I would say 75% of being a professional developer is learning to use someone else’s tools and 25% is learning to write your own. 
Really? To me this sounds a lot like a struct rather than a class.
Then do it based on that release model. I'm not finicky on the when nor the conditions for doing so.
This is cyberpunk as fuck and I love it

I would love to hear a little more about what you're looking into! I myself wrote my MSc dissertation on a method of program repair using language modeling and fault localization (here: http://www.chasestevens.com/papers/msc_dissertation.pdf ). GenProg (which /u/omega1563 linked to) is definitely worth looking at. I additionally recently discovered literature on grammatical evolution which may be interesting to you - dumping a few links below. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074373151730206X http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4150162/?reload=true https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224695489_Parallel_Grammatical_Evolution_with_Backward_Processing https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gramEvol/vignettes/ge-intro.pdf

As an author of my own web framework, I am wondering what things would prevent this. My framework doesnt support streaming, so mostly I am curious about number 1. How would one prevent 1a from happening? From 1b point of view, I see that aiohttp has a 'client_max_size' setting, which prevents the 100MB body from happening, but you can take a .99MB request, and do the same thing, just with more connections. Same attack, just smaller body, more connections. How does one actually prevent 1b? The body is going to end up in memory regardless, right? How can I mitigate against these things? Do you have any suggestions?

I'm working on a similar project so I'll write here few points, hoping to help you: First, don't trust so much Tweepy Docs... They're often poorly written and/or outdated (for example, about the http codes exceptions handing). Search a lot on recent Stack Overflow questions about this. Second, despite my effort I too had lots of problems managing dates with Tweepy and user time-line so I solved in another way: download the entire history of a user and save it as CSV (or JSON?) and then search every tweet between two dates using classic datetimes python methods (you'll need to convert from string to datetime with the proper formatting). I don't remember the rates limit about user time-line (3000 tweets per day?) but there are some nice scripts out there capable of scraping the entire time line using waits and few tricks. See my code [here] (https://github.com/SergioLaRosa/TEA_Twitter-Extraction-and-Analysis/blob/master/timeline_scraper.py) Bad code quality, sorry about that: I hope it helps you :)

Github lets you use an api access key instead of your password for git logins. Does instagram have some option to get one?
Im not too sure about the process you want to do, but ive also been working with excel spreadsheets, and ive found openpyxl useful when reading and writing data to spreadsheets.
I'm new at Wallaroo Labs and I started working through the Python API to get a better handle on how things work. As I encounter bumps in the road I'm addressing them, be it in documentation or in error messages. Hopefully this should be more friendly to newcomers in our next release. After that I'll be digging into benchmarking to help narrow down areas for improvement in our cluster and state management code. This includes some code that specifically targets the impact of the GIL in some of our code paths, which is one place where clustering can easily help (esp. with tricky cases which need to manage stateful computations). 
Thanks for the reply and the advice! Even though it's not a perfect solution it sounds like a good backup plan! 
So basically, it's a project that uses Tarantula to localize the fault in a Python program and then tries to repair it automatically. Right now my program tries to repair it using brute force, i.e., replace the variables in the faulty line with other variables in the program. So I want to instead move on to something more concrete which led me to find of genetic programming. My focus is now to use the program statements similar to the buggy statement and use the logic from those lines to remove the bug. 
Maybe using this python wrapper for w3mimgdisplay? https://github.com/seikichi/pyw3mimg
Thanks for the suggestion. I will try to integrate that when I get time!!

Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython. We **highly encourage** you to re-submit your post over on there. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community is actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers. If you have a question to do with homework or an assignment of any kind, please make sure to read their sidebar rules **before** submitting your post. If you have any questions or doubts, feel free to reply or send a modmail to us with your concerns. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
Thanks for the replies, but how does this actually help? Isnt typicall behavior for the developer to just ask for the whole body right away anyways?
I think [spacy](https://spacy.io/docs/) deserves a mention too. Currently using it in my Thesis and absolutely loving it!
Well, you can not protect everyone. Developer needs to know what to do, framework just provides tools. Especially with large payloads, you have to be sure that you handle large amount of data right. It is developer responsibility. 
&gt;Well, if you didn't read, but you still argue about it... Until that we were talking about unsourced claims about worse performance, and python API, not about the source code, but okay ? &gt;do you really want me to second-hand relay to you what's written in CPython source code? A few links to relevant code would be nice. Especially about the quadratic behavior of adding more dunder methods to `type` struct. You can call me stupid, but while I know all the words, this sentence fail to make sense to me. I don't need links to schlemiel the painter, that can be googled easily. But I did not find anything about what you talk about. &gt;Because it sells the language better to its users. They are not selling anything, ideas are added through the ML python-ideas and heavily discussed with the people that need them beforehand, not to mention the PEP process. To my knowledge, nothing was added without at least one strong real-life case. So, they are not really forcing things upon the users. &gt;Every new release they have new feature X, which... often needs to be implemented by means of adding "dunder" methods. Again, examples ? I really want to believe you, but which new features require new dunder methods ? IIRC last time they added a dunder method it was for the @ operator, which was good I think. And it was already some years ago. Before that ? I have no idea. &gt; Python core developers never had a good foresight into how languages might evolve, what features will be needed in the future, which will prove to be useless, but because of how these features were implemented, there was neither a way to go back and undo them, nor the way to develop them in separation... And this is how Python is gotten into the mess of Python 3, with ever increasing number of "dunder" methods. Examples. &gt;arrays, no matter the type of array. Arrays don't handle concatenation, insertion, and deletion well, but this is often the operations required. There are other data structures which perform much better under these conditions. How strings being immutable is relevant to the discussion about python2/3 ? I did not know the rope data structure before, though, thanks. &gt;`range()` creates an object which can be subscripted, but no other iterator in standard library does that. You mean that range is never depleted ? Why would it ? Because generators need to deplete ? Who said range had to be a generator ?
&gt; I don't know why the comment is down voted. Because there's no necessity to running his script in a virtual env. It's like saying, Cmon man... gnome-terminal -e 'pipenv run python3 start.py' Nobody cares what your intro professor taught you about running things "the right way".
Thanks!
I’m making an Instagram just for this 
lldb is the native debugger for osx as everything is generally built with clang, but they're more or less equivalent.
You could use `cgi`, but it's really a much better option to use a microframework like Flask.
How much of a speed difference will I notice if I went with python/flask be raw php/Mvc architecture?
And that's a bad thing?
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython. We **highly encourage** you to re-submit your post over on there. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community is actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers. If you have a question to do with homework or an assignment of any kind, please make sure to read their sidebar rules **before** submitting your post. If you have any questions or doubts, feel free to reply or send a modmail to us with your concerns. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
No, seriously if you want any contract work, and know anything about backend web development, hit me up.
I think this is a great think. Python intends to as intuitive as possible
It's impossible to tell without knowing what database you'll be using, what access patterns will look like, how you'll deploy your application, etc. On the whole, just using Python instead of PHP probably won't win you performance. 
Then why it's called "python web server" in the title? 
Being that your are self taught you probably don’t know how to do things the right way. Sorry that is just reality and you are better off understanding an existing code base. The Django rest framework code base for example is very approachable. That being said building a framework is probably not the best use of your time if you are just trying to port an api. I would recommend using Django rest or as mentioned before flask and an orm, maybe even mashmallow if it is a josn api that requires object serialization. Django rest is more complete and adds things you shouldn’t build on your own, mainly authorization, middleware for csrf. Understanding Django would also allow you to see real world software design patterns that self taught programmers tend to not understand or have exposure to.
Hey OP, I was messing with 2FA and came up with the following solution,I know a pull request would have been better but I couldn't test the code as I am hitting the rate limit pretty quickly and Instagram is blocking me,So I thought of posting it here.Hopefully this helps :) if res_text["two_factor_required"] == True: identifier = res_text["two_factor_info"]["two_factor_identifier"] username = credential["username"] verification_code = input("2FA Verification Code: ") verification_data = {"username":username,"verificationCode":verification_code,"identifier":identifier} two_factor_request = session.post("https://www.instagram.com/accounts/login/ajax/two_factor/", data=verification_data, allow_redirects=True) two_factor_text = json.loads(two_factor_request.text) if two_factor_request["status"] == "fail": return None,two_factor_text else: return session, res_text 
Indeed! https://bugs.python.org/
A colleague accidentally discovered this crasher. ```python import itertools def gen(): yield from myiter myiter = itertools.chain.from_iterable(gen()) list(myiter) ```
But where's the fun in *that*, when you can ascii-ize the images?
I did something similar, but end up using Excel native functions to handle the import. 1. Create data frame and output to a CSV. 2. Use Power Query within Excel to import the data. 3. Every time user opens Excel, it imports the latest data. My users actually like that a lot. They do a lot of work manipulate the data (formulas, etc) within the spreadsheet. They just want to use data.
On Chapter 17 of “Learning Python” by Mark Lutz. Feeling sleepy.
This post is better suited for r/learnpython 
I like the idea, but tbh I think 400mb for this app is bit too big.
Huh I never would have guessed that, thanks for the warning. I'm a little new in this space - would you still have the same problem if you were storing a SQLite db in S3 and using it the same way?
I use Fedora on a Lenovo laptop for work and a 5 year old MacBook Pro for my personal machine. I rarely undock the Lenovo because the hardware is so inferior to my MBP. The screen quality is garbage, the keyboard is lackluster, and as you pointed out, the trackpad feels like punishment by comparison. I enjoy how customizable Linux is and have been able to tweak things to facilitate my workflow in a way that I probably couldn't on my Mac. However, there is just something overwhelmingly pleasant about using my Mac that isn't there with my Linux machine. My suggestion is to use whatever you think will bring you the greatest overall satisfaction on a day to day basis. I personally don't worry too much about spending money on things that I use every day, because the joy and/or comfort I get from their use almost always outweighs the cost. Good luck! 
Did you get any solution to this? I started having the same issue today.
The author of this book was just featured on the [Talk python to me](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/156/python-history-and-perspectives) podcast. They talk about this among other things.
That's a super good point - I'm also in research and I agree you often want stuff to be as bare bones as possible so you can be SURE you know what's going on. I don't know enough about Pandas and HDF5 in Python to understand the differences in assumptions / data modeling between h5py and Pandas. Judging from this and many of these other comments, it sounds like using Pandas may try to push you into doing things "the Pandas way", which could be more complex (or easier) than the raw HDF5 way. Likewise, the whole reason I'm getting interested in HDF5 is to use a format that's easy to give to the user and lends itself to reproducible science. That's a great point that forcing someone into the whole Pandas framework may not be worth it and increase friction.
Is it easy to give someone a copy of your SQLite and get them up to speed analyzing it, i.e. enabling reproducible data analysis/science?
A silly app to analyze/present data about your Chipotle consumption from mint.com transaction history. Mostly needed a reason to learn Dash for data viz and this seemed interesting enough (to me at least :) ) If you're interested in checking it out -- [here it is](tjw.pythonanywhere.com)
I'm working on a music player that can download music from YouTube, play them and delete them if I don't like it. My current version uses threads inefficiently (creates a new thread for each song), so I'm making a new version with consistent threads with Locks and Queues.
Take a look at bottle or flask. I like bottle because it's tiny and understandable. If you don't use a framework, you'll be reinventing the wheel and managing sockets. 
True, today for some reason I see a lot of python jobs in web development. But none of my friends who have python jobs do web development. They do : * education software for special-need kids * software and hardware testing * data science * CI/release * game development (high-level programming, like AI behavior) The thing is, most of the time, these kind of jobs are not advertised as python jobs. They happen to use python, which in the end is just a tool among many other. Note that data science jobs do not always require a degree, or prior data science knowledge. Sometimes all you need is programming experience. Back-end web development is not as bad as it seems, because django/flask are good tools for the job, they (mostly) don't get in your way. The challenge is usually storing and transforming data. Also, check out [this page](https://www.python.org/about/success/#software-development).
I just started using 3.6 instead of 2.7. Which is aggravating since they use different syntax.
Can you? Sure. Should you? Probably not. Seems like a job for low-level apis. You could probably build an analyser in python but actual monitoring of process will not be performant
Can someone guide me through the steps in order to get this running on macOS Sierra? I'm currently learning C++ but this looks like it could be a fun little project before taking (Python) next semester. 
Yes you would. S3 objects don't support seeking and writing like a regular filesystem, so you have to download them to look inside or modify them.
&gt; highly internally inconsistent Never heard that before. Could you give some examples?
aiohttp has (optional) Flask style decorators now for routing :)
Ok, i will post it there.
I like this idea of 20 minutes projects.
Thanks
Do you have python installed on your mac? If no, do brew install python3 or google how to install python3. After you have python3 installed go to my github and follow the step.😄
Thanks. I’ve been trying my hardest to do so. I am actually currently working on a game of blackjack in terminal. Not the hardest thing but doable for someone of my skill level.
Will do
Now add terminal colors.
Thanks for the great reply. I’ve been doing something like this by looking up solutions to problems I have and trying to understand them and reconstruct then myself.
Thanks, I think it's cool to watch a tutorial video and not have to sit through hours of endless videos and hours of footage. Making this every Friday if you want to catch more of them.
Typo “open_resourcce”
Thanks for pointing that out, but as of right now my errors that I'm getting are to do solely with the login method. The error that I am getting is TypeError: '&gt;' not supported between instances of 'sqlite3.Cursor' and 'int' which is from line 66, and if I remove the comparison then I get the error: TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable which is from line 68
Maybe you can try something more appropriate for single scripts: * [gist](https://gist.github.com/); * [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/); * [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/python); * [paste.ee](https://paste.ee/) * [ideone](https://ideone.com/) * [notebooks.azure](https://notebooks.azure.com/) Nice job, anyway :)
The main reason I didn't catch that is as of right now I haven't done anything to do with that method yet, it's just kind of sitting there doing nothing for now. I think I'm using a good editor, I use atom.
Why would there be more than one result for a username? Shouldn’t they be unique?
Holy shit! You so good bro!
You can interact with a live Excel using xlwings..
Thanks for this. Looks very well put together. 
Read the sidebar Post in the correct subreddit Post an example of your code import string isn't really a thing.
It imports the [`string`](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/string.html) module. Check out r/learnpython
It's definitely a good idea to use a scripting language vs a compiled one for speed of write-compile-test-debug cycle. That said, 20 devs are going to be faster than "hundreds" of devs on a project of the same size regardless of language. To paraphrase Fred Brooks: Adding people to a project makes it later.
I helped put the book together so I'm a little biased. However it was a lot of fun talking to the various people in the book and I do think there's a lot of interesting content. The core python developers were especially interesting to me. However the many authors I spoke with were really fun too.
Two days ago I released the last version (0.72) of Splitnjoin with important addition (now it's possible to split files by parts -choosing their total number-, in addition to the usual split per chunks size). Fast as usual, simple as usual. https://github.com/SergioLaRosa/splitnjoin 
Very interesting!
Read [PEP 333](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/), it describes the subject in very details. 
Use pyinstaller to create the exe, then use http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main%5FPage to create the installer. I'm going to create a sample project and write up on packaging up python projects and creating the installer soon. (well maybe soon).
