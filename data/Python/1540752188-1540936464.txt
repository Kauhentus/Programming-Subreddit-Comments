Btw, ClassificaIO is cross-platform, so one can implement it for Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows operating systems. Also, it has an interactive point-and-click GUI to 25 supervised classification algorithms in scikit-learn. For more information, see the accompanying [research paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/10/25/240184.full.pdf). 
Awesome, thank you! I think this is great. It's silly but I get annoyed at having to alter essentially the same script just to change input files or use different columns.
I think that should be `mul = num % 13`
I’m brand new to python coding and for a assignment I have to make a program that can detect odd vs even numbers and multiples of 13. I have two questions the first one is that when I try to run the code to see if works correctly it says that the else statement “mod” is invalid why is that? And finally how can I program it tell the difference between multiples of 13?
Exactly!
I think you guys are going to get a lot of traction with this... I think Continuum would be interested in including this with the Anaconda installation package.
you can't have a condition on the else statement. That's meant to be a final catch-all.
Else statements cannot contain a condition. It's always just going to be else: statements
It should have been sys.exit(42) 
Just the else statement is like the if none apply option. So what could I change it too to the conditions? Would that be elif?
for people who run NVidia GPUs with the proprietary driver, there's nvtop, but I don't know if it supports batch mode, since I didn't get to try that tool yet
You are describing the use case for recipe 13 in the linked cookbook.
Thank you. "Simple and quick".... that's exactly what it was supposed to be, and the documentation is an important part of that. If you want someone to use a package, it needs to be usable and that means documented. I hate working on those docs... ugh... I've got a big update to do today... but without them there would be very few users. I've heard many times from people that it was the documentation that got them to try it. People do use it too. I was shooting for a copy, paste, run experience. The Cookbook is where most people, including me, begins. Then it a matter of either possibly using that code as a starting point. I'm shooting for least number of barriers between someone deciding to try it out and a working GUI on the screen in front of them. Easy pip install or copy a single file should get you up and running. 5 minutes, tops, should be what it takes. A couple weeks back I started a YouTube series on using it too. Video is not a resource I use to learn programming, but I learned a lot of other people learn this way. All of this is nothing more than common sense however. No magic involved.
I've considered this but I'm very insecure about my code! not used to showing it to other people. But this is a good suggestion and I should try it.
Working on building a devteam to cook hype items from supreme,off-white,adidas,nike, etc. DM if interested : )
thank you, I will look into it!
Pycharm is good, so is atom and sublime text
Visual Studio Code (with the Microsoft Python plugin) is pretty good. It works on Windows and Mac. 
I'm insecure about showing other people my code. Maybe that's something I need to get over!
Thank you I will look into it!
Start with any text editor and the command line. You'll manually do things that IDE's do for you, but you'll also learn a lot.
I wastn't really in your situation, but here's something that may... or may not be of interest to you. Some years back, I was looking for a good book for beginners (I was considering writing my own...), and this is how I found PLAI (Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation). It ignited interest in picking things apart, and one such thing was Python. I did some C programming way-way back, but I didn't really understand it then, and didn't really like it, so, I figured that I might be able to ease my way into understanding how Python really works was through using some intermediate tools that work with Python's interpeter directly on one hand, but on the other hand allow higher-level approach. So, I tried Cython and some SWIG with some of my own make-believe code (like implementing Base64, but with certain requirements Python's built-in implementation didn't meet, mostly speed), or writing bindings to other libraries. I actually did learn some stuff about Python. Concepts related to its memory management, how it sees objects in its runtime, how those objects are meant to interact etc. But there was still too much "magic", especially with Cython. So, eventually, I ended up writing in C. Writing in C exposed me to a whole new spectrum of problems that programmers working on Python interpreter were trying to solve. But, once I understood what the solution was, I become also disappointed in the quality and generality of approach... A lot of choices seemed like they were motivated by the defects of the technology being used. I tried Go, but very soon was disappointed by the language designers' approach, which would also favor popular and easy over "the right thing". Now, I'm looking more into Rust (with the eye still towards Python, as in writing bindings for mostly Rust code). Rust isn't perfect, but, at least, I sympathize with the desire to do "the right thing". It's in the same ballpark with C++, so, if you are thinking about choosing a language, and you did some Haskell, Rust may be a good choice for the next step.
If you are looking into python development, can't go wrong with pycharm, the free community edition has everything you need. If you are looking for something more like Rstudio, or if you want to use python for data science and machine learning, you will find Spyder and Jupyter to be very useful. You can download Anaconda, it comes with both and other tools in addition to many useful python libraries out of the box. Sublime text, visual studio code and atom are good options too, but they are not really IDEs, more like feature full text editors that could act to some degrees like IDEs depending on the plugins available.
Very interesting - I figure though it would do me good to get more comfortable with C first? And I'll check out that book! 
Spyder is perfect for data science. I'm not sure I will use it as an general python IDE. &amp;#x200B; [https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is very nice, but cost 200$/year. &amp;#x200B; Did you see the list on [https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments](https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments) ? It's not 100% up to date, for example netbeans is on version 9 now and on [https://netbeans.apache.org/](https://netbeans.apache.org/) but their is some stuff. &amp;#x200B;
I have become learning python recently too. And i've decided to use Visual Studio Code because of its lightweight.
Wingware never gets no respect! But [Wing Personal](http://wingware.com/downloads/wingide-personal) is a complete, well-designed IDE with every feature, is well-supported (very responsive email support) and is freeeeee.
Interesting... I don't know if I should be scared or indifferent. I'm also surprised IBM has 34b lying around haha.
 def main(): print('Hello user, please enter an odd multiple of 13,') print('I will be checking to see if you are right.') print() num = int(input('Please enter your number: ')) print() if check_odd(): if check_multiple(): print('Your number is correct!') else: print('Your number is odd but not a multiple of 13.') elif check_multiple(): print('Your number is a multiple of 13 but not odd.') else: print('Your number is neither odd or a multiple of 13.') def check_odd(): if num % 2 == 0: return False else: return True def check_multiple(): if num % 13 == 0: return True else: return False main() i don't feel you need an intro() and main() so i combined them, and cleaned your code a little. the problem showing on your screen was that an else: statement doesn't take arguments (you put "mod &gt; 0"), it is just executed when all other if and elif statements return false.
Sounds fun (not sarcastic)
Sublime text with anaconda plugin and pudb would be enough, I think.
PyCharm Community is free. 
I'm a fairly experienced developer and I can't think of a single reason to use IDLE after doing Hello World. Are there any actual _benefits_ ("it's no worse than X" isn't a benefit; it's the absence of a detriment).
Use the latest version of python 3. Don't use 2.7.

From my experience, I would suggest you to stick to Spyder. &amp;#x200B; I have been doing python development and data science for years with Spyder alone. &amp;#x200B; It is a complete IDE that fulfilled all my needs (no extra plugins to add), no need to use something else (tried Atom, it was terrible).
You'd better do it the other way around, have the data bootstrapped in your script and extracting it when the script is run. For an example of that, see [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py).
I don't think I lost anything that wasn't easily picked up later by using RStudio, to be honest.
Making a major game title is like making a movie. Lots of engineers, artists (graphics, photography, sound, etc.), actors and people to manage and direct it all. On the programming side, there are lots of third party software tools (graphics engines, 3d modeling tools, motion capture, etc.) and in-house tools that get reused. If you want to feel a LITTLE better, look at the independent games that are offered on Steam. More often these involve 2d graphics and only a dozen or so people. You may even find games that are built by a single person. They can be very fun and addictive but they are nothing like Red Dead Redemption! 
awesome work!
Why did I predict this would be the name Pydroid haha

I mean...you can claim that but you haven't made any sort of argument that that is the case. You claimed they don't care about performance and efficiency. That is almost certainly wrong, and for some reason you just don't want to admit it.
Problem is with your while statement itself. You have: while lives != 0 or lives != 10: So when lives hit zero, one of your “or” conditions is still met. 0 != 10. Same issue when lives is 10. 10 != 0, so the first condition is met to keep looping. Change the “or” to an “and” and it should work. while lives != 0 and lives != 10: Hope that helps!
It runs smoothly because it's C++ compiled code, also graphics APIs on consoles are very efficient

What realistically would you use a decorator for? more specifically the static method one? and shouldn't the two add functions have different names? If they are the same they will conflict?
Also they aren't starting from scratch with each game. Games are built on top of complex game engines which handle things like simulating physics, rendering graphics, threading, etc... For example Red Dead Redemption 2 is built on the RAGE game engine which has been around since 2006 and used in numerous games. 
Eventually some glue python here and there maybe, I think I saw some .py files in Witcher 3.
No. You would need your customer to use a zip program that automatically executes scripts that it finds. If you or anyone else creates a zip utility that automatically executes, I, as a cybersecurity professional, will personally come to your house and stab you.
Not to mention, it's not like they started that multi-year development project from scratch, staring at a blank document. They have all the existing code that studio has access too, their personal toolboxes and portfolios, some open source stuff, various frameworks (+many studios don't code their own engine). Nobody sits down and says, "OK then, time to derive and build an entire 3d graphics engine from scratch with no outside references." Well, (RollerCoaster Tycoon)\[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RollerCoaster\_Tycoon\_(video\_game)#Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_(video_game)#Development)\] was written in assembly, but even that guy had a bunch of existing code to work with. &amp;#x200B;
Chromebooks now run linux apps (just Google for "chromebook linux apps" and look at recent results). So, while I haven't done it, it's likely fairly easy to use python on a chromebook now.
A QA team is essential, and most companies (except obviously Ubisoft) have one. Unit and integration tests are essential, and any halfway respectable game company uses them for testing core game logic. Extensively.
Vim 
Not for anything remotely performance oriented.
Trying to automate bug reporting system using xlwings, pandas and selenium. 
Asset management is a key part of making a game like this. Something to track all the textures, sounds, animations, 3d models, maps, etc. Probably 50% of your staff are people working on making and putting together assets and the quality of the tool and pipeline is crucial. This part is also something realistically you'd use Python for. The core game rendering engine isn't going to be Python for a AAA game, and probably not the AI scripting. But the tools used to manage and build the game can be anything.
&gt; except obviously Ubisoft Ha. Rekt.
You will have to return something from the function. It creates the list "a" and calculates "average", but those are local variables in the function and are not useable as-is in the rest of the notebook. So, after `print(average)`, you'll need to add something like `return a`, and change `coinflips(.5, 1000)` to something like `flip_list = coinflips(.5, 1000)`. Then you can use the list flip_list in the rest of the notebook. To simply plot the results of the flips, you could do... flip_list = coinflips(.5, 1000) plt.figure(figsize=(20,5)) plt.plot(flip_list) You can then calculate whatever you want from the flip_list and plot that. 
They do use that stuff, but that only tests code under expected scenarios. Actual players are really fucking good at breaking games in really stupid ways.

Just to offer a slightly different perspective, I'd suggest trying something like VS Code with the Python extension. It has a lot of IDE features despite being just an editor, so it gives you more freedom than IDEs in general. It's similar to Sublime, but it has a built-in extension manager and amazing Python support, you could even install Sublime key bindings if you're used to them. And you can even do things like peek the definition of a function just like in an IDE such as PyCharm, etc. It doesn't have a steep learning curve either, there's a bunch of videos about Python in VS Code that you can take a look and see if you like it and use it as feature overviews. Also, thanks for the roguelike guide link, I haven't ever heard of libtcod and I'll give it a try!

Great work, seriously, great work. Do you know if it is possible to manage C++ project that export C extensions to python?, I ma particularly interested on that. I know that with Wheel it is possible to manage C extensions, but is quite not simple.

Interesting! I'm used to working in frameworks like Spring and Symfony - they use the Dependency Injection design pattern to make unit testing not only possible, but super easy. In my experimentation with Unreal and Unity, it seems like a lot of stuff is done like `GetWorld()-&gt;GetWorldSettings())-&gt;getUpVector()`, which relies on the internals of the engine. I haven't worked out how to inject a mock World for testing yet. In general, I find that the overwhelming majority of UE4 and Unity guides are extremely basic (How To make Pick Up), and I struggle to find articles and opinions on the design patterns that end up being industry standard.
Yeah, you can figure it out.

If you truly dedicate yourself to it fulltime I think you can do it, depending how's the job market in your area. Just be ready for a lot of roadblocks, and "I don't know if I want to do this" moments. Stick with it, and you'll see the progress. Good luck!
Unless you are like EA and you just release it with partial functionality. 
Where I’m from isn’t that great job market wise. I have a contact at a huge tech company who taught me about python. I will be meeting with him in December to focus what I need to learn to land a job but my goal it to move to Charlotte NC. 
How long did you study before your first job 
Probably something close to 6 to 8 months, and I landed a job as a web dev, but the market where I live don't have a lot of opportunities, so you might do it in 6 months if you really get into it and have a good market.
Numpy, Tensorflow, PyTorch are all fast. Python is an ecosystem, not just a language
You have a couple different options. The first is to use an online idea like repl.it, as others have said. Another one I like is https://pythonanywhere.com , which gives you free access to a Linux installation with Python, and free hosting. The second is to get Linux apps running using Google's official tools. I don't know much about this, but I'm sure you can find something tutorials. The third is to get a real Linux installation on your Chromebook. You can run something similar to a virtual machine (chroot) using crouton, dual boot between chromium and a Linux distro such as GalliumOS, or completely replace chromium with Linux. The advantage is that you get a real Linux installation with real, local Python.
I think an important thing to consider that people here don't emphasize enough, games at that scale aren't 100% driven by code. For many of the details, like character development, storylines, animations, level-design, etc.. There are people working full-time to build _tools_ that let the actual _game designers_ make these things. Compared to a garden, it's the difference between * I own no plants (I don't program) * I own a few plants and water them to keep them alive (I know some html and maybe some python/js) * I keep a garden as a hobby (experienced programmer) * I am a full-time gardener (professional programmer) * I _employ_ a full-time gardener (business) ... and then, where the major difference shows is * I employ _20_ gardeners, as well as 3 biologists, 2 _tool-makers_, 6 environmentalists, a chemist, and a garden-designer who work _full-time_ to support the gardeners with tools, designs and knowledge specifically tailored to the kinds of plants and gardens we're dealing with At some point, you're not really talking about "gardening" or "programming" anymore, at some point, because programmers write tools to support others, some people fall into more specialized roles like "level-builder tool engineer", who work full-time to build tools to let the game designers design the levels etc...
Was expecting Bethesda, but this also works.
Sure, but they aren't fast because of the Python parts of it. It's the C bindings that make it fast -- and the tradeoff is that you have constraints about how you use the tools provided in those libraries. You can just as easily say that Cython's fast, but it's hardly Python at that point.
I feel for you, because i was in the same situation working a dead end law enforcement job. But man I wish I had asked or had some one to tell me how not to play so close to the chest. One night after geting chewed out for not stopping enough people and a slew of other political issues. I went home to my wife and broke down, she told me to quit and go to school for computer science. We lived off of her paycheck for 3 years dirt poor before I literally won the contact jack pot and had an adjunct professor get me a foot in the door at a local company. I worked my way up from admin, to DBA, to developer and it took so many long nights, and huge personal life set backs. Though through it all my wife stood by me and we now look back and reminisce on that hell of a emotional ride.
I think that might be a bit rough because you need to leave time for your job hunt as well -- which is in itself a full-time job. Apart from the interview preparation you need to do, you'll also need to go through the actual interviewing process which can take a few weeks up to a few months (even if you're successful). If you don't get hired, you'll need to repeat that a few times. So 6 months to self-learn + get employment is pretty tight, to be perfectly honest with you. When you move back home, will you be able to get some less demanding work to support yourself? 
Probably not, but a game that does use Python and pygame by one developer (I'm pretty sure it was just one guy) is Super Potato Bruh https://www.pygame.org/project/3687 It looks like a fun project.
You don’t need OOP to do that.
&gt; I’ve been programming for a few months Well people study CS in university for 4 years, then graduate and work for more years. RDR2 team likely included tons of junior and senior engineers who had 5 to 10 years of experience. Nobody learns programming for a few months and then join RDR2 team. 
Play coding challenges on hackerrank.com. If you start finding those easy start playing the ones on leetcode.com. This will allow you to pass a coding interview.
You could say any modern language is an "ecosystem, not just a language" at that point. CPython is extremely slow compared to the modern C, C++ and fortran compilers. But CPython can obviously use the C/C++/fortran libraries. That still doesn't make CPython fast. It just means if you know what you're doing, you absolutely can use Python for components of high performance software.
I get the feeling that Bethesda does have a QA team, but the team is understaffed and never told the full specification of any part of the game, so they never quite know what they need to be testing for. 
Yeah, don't get caught up in tooling, you can easily get lost and stop learning just to play with the shiniest new toys! What matters is that you find a program you're comfortable with and keep on learning! Personally, I've ditched IDEs since I stopped working with Java, and I've been really happy just having an editor that I can write code and not wonder what all the buttons, tabs and etc do. That's why I had to give an alternative, especially since VS Code is open source and I always back those efforts. Cheers!
That's what I did. Start easy with code academy and spend time reading the code you want to write. Start looking at positions you want to apply for and gain those skills (or learn to talk about them and then learn on the job ;). Try reaching out to employers and interview even if you know you'll get rejected because you'll learn what you really need to know there. 
And with Linux as well ;)
Do you mean something like Pipenv?
Be weary of burn-out, man. It's difficult for many people to focus for so long, so solely, on a specific topic or task. Be sure that you space things out, set yourself REALISTIC goals, don't be too hard on yourself when you fail (which will be ridiculously often if you're a human being), don't let your social life suffer too much or die, and please, take care of yourself. I wish you the absolute best of luck. I'm 22 and doing something similar, I'm a complete amateur at coding. If you want a penpal, I'll fucking do it. Even if it's just sharing your little achievements when you learn or execute something cool. 
A tip I’ll give is to not go in with the focus of learning Python specifically. Sure, pick and learn one language to start with (Python is a fine choice), but realize that learning about CS topics like algorithm and data structures is arguably more important. Plus, once you learn the fundamentals of one language, it’s much easier to pick up others. 
I'm writing a Flask app to assist with record keeping during incident response. We follow a similar procedure to [PagerDuty](https://response.pagerduty.com) and the app helps standardize the [Scribe role](https://response.pagerduty.com/before/different_roles/#scribe). 
CX_Freeze like PyInstaller can be easily decompiled. Nuitka and Cython seem like the best option to make it reasonably difficult to decompile the source code.
Because python is used as a wrapper for C.
My feeling is Bethesda has grown accustomed to the community fixing bugs for them, so they just release beta-quality products and let it happen.
God no. Lack of compiling and dynamic typing make it far too slow.
Working 5+ years built on the backbone of 10+ years of earlier code and knowing how to do it.
This is just a concept though and works in a way like doctest does. This is like comparing doctest to popular unit testing libraries like pytest, nose, etc. Just one advantage I can think about right now is giving the developer an "option" to implement scheduling. This is not a full-fledged scheduler, but I think this is way easier compared to other popular Python schedulers out there that require calling several functions. Additionally, the crontab syntax is quite a standard to Unix users and they don't need to get muddied to do scheduling in Python. As for adding a decorator, instead, that is another good option. I saw something like that on Github while implementing the library. One last thing that I need to solve in the future is removing the confusion on mixing cron and documentation syntax.
I'd recommend talking to him before trying to pull this off.
Same. Do it, dude. It's worth it.
The full spec is the code though. I'll give it to you, but it won't make sense. I recently write a magnification function that's connected up to a slider. I'm not quite sure why it works nicely (or if it always does). I just messed with it until it felt right.
I respect your plan because I love a balls-out gamble. You may or may not be able to do it -- but you'll never know if you don't try. G'luck!
Gotta give it all I got and make something happen.
Literally millions of dollars and hundreds (sometimes thousands) of people all working in different studios around the globe. There are usually entire teams of people just working on one aspect of the game. For example, a team of 50 people could be doing nothing but creating textures while another team of 50 could be doing nothing but modeling rocks and buildings. It due to the large teams of people focusing all their energy on one aspect of the game that makes a game like RDRII so detailed and content-rich. &amp;#x200B; As for the technical aspect and how the game runs on consoles, console development has some crucial differences from PC development. The biggest one being that the hardware is static unlike PC where you need to test multiple possible CPU/GPU/RAM configurations. The developers know exactly how far they can push the hardware and what specific techniques to use to maximize their use of the resources available. Not to mention multiple teams of QA people working around the clock.
I don’t have an exact job in mind but the guy I know does data management. I know I’ve got more to learn and figure out before I try it. The goal is to get into a tech job and be remote eventually.
Fuuuuck that. I won't even take a job anymore unless I can work from home half the time or more. I don't understand how employers and employees even got in this position. You can't be THAT productive after 8 hours. Hell, I think they did a study and found that you're basically at peak performance with a 6 hour per day work week, and the rest you barely get anything done. I feel like management these days has this antiquated idea of how work should be from the factory days. We aren't factory workers. Our products come from our minds, and they're a product of our mental well-being. I think they try to drain as many hours as possible but the hours don't matter as much for us as much as the quality, and that's going to be correlated with our sanity. More focused workers that are happy to collaborate are going to make less bugs, which means the same product takes less hours, and is more valuable in the end. You wanna milk the software engineer cow, you gotta let it take breaks and let it rest, let it roam freerange, let it sleep a full night. A stressed out cow is going to stop producing as much milk. You want the good stuff, you gotta take care of your cows.
Technically yes it is but you’re gonna have to do like coding gymnastics to get it to work
Interesting. I do data analytics/analysis myself, started learning python about a year ago. Doing data analysis with python is very lucrative and very in demand, most definitely. I’ve found that python has opened up a lot of different avenues in doing data analysis. I originally wanted to do machine learning/predictive analytics, but now I’m using it to compile big data sets (like 11 million rows), ping different apis, do translations, scrape files from various locations to compile, doing text sentiment, etc. Python is very powerful. But I’ve been hacking through various datasets for 10 yrs or so. Now I can’t even imagine doing my job without python. So I think you’re on a great path, but I’d certainly complement any python learning with at least some rudimentary excel and maybe just learning how how businesses use data for decision making. The biggest thing that helps me in my job is just curiosity. I want to know how things are going in a business, I want to figure things out, and doing data analysis helps me. Again, all the best!
How is this a legitimate answer
Have a very specific plan in place before you make the jump, otherwise you can end up wasting precious time learning too broadly, or worse yet, the wrong things for that entry level job.
Of course not. But it is helpful.
I think this is the right answer. This sort of thing should be handled with proper alerting, nothing too harsh. It should be caught but it doesn't necessarily need to be automatically denied. But I think there should be somewhat of a Python authority like web Certificate Authorities, and some really common packages with high usage should be signed by them. Maybe if you reach a certain number of downloads or popularity, you submit a signing request to the Python CA, and they sign it with each new release. This could be a subset of PyPI packages, a "trusted" repo. Maybe a user would do `pip install --trusted django` and it would break unless it was in the "trusted" branch, so for the most part people out there who want extra protection would know that anything they install with that flag has been verified as the correct package.
As soon as I read that part I was thinking OOP causes a hell of a lot more problems than it fixes when you're scaling to large applications. There's a reason a lot of people are talking about ECS.
It is a quite commonly held opinion (and one hat I share) that OOP is a negative thing and leads to difficult to maintain code.
Even with the degree, it can be hard. Out of college, I was earning less money than my (low) rent + basic food + loan payments. I'm now getting paid about 6x what I was getting then (1995) and we just bought a house with cash. It can be done, but it takes time and not in-considerable luck.
"Vendorizing"?
For sure. I would recommend something with at least a 15" screen and a full sized keyboard. Other than that you will be fine until you are creating much larger projects. 
It's not like it's their first rodeo. They've been developing something similar for over 20 years now starting with GTA3.
I’m probably going to get a job doing some lil work. But I want to really invest myself into a coding job. I know I can learn quickly but it’s an entire new career field for me. My bills aren’t terrible because I will Love at my sisters. Maybe $1100-1200 a month when I cut back, not including food and such. 
/r/learnpython 
I’ve started code academy but as I said I work to much to really give it much time right now. I know I enjoy it so far, but I think the call and interview part is definitely a good idea. Thanks. 
That's disgusting. Literally 2 hours of time per day to eat, exercise, clean, and socialize.
Wow, this is really cool. I'll definitely give this a try!
Glad you were able to get out of that situation. And what a wife man. Hopefully one day I’ll meet one that’ll stand by me the same. 
Alright, in that case, I look forward to hearing from you at some point! 
The depth of this answer reflects my best guess at the level what OP is looking for, given the experience and thought reflected in OP's question. Also, when I come across a question with no answer or few answers, I tend to answer even if I don't have time for a more complete answer. I try to answer only when I have something to add to the discussion, and, when there's no discussion yet, it's easy to add it.
My personal opinion is that OOP is a double-edged sword. You can write some very good and easy to maintain code with it. But you can also create a hellish nightmare of an application that's impossible to maintain. It's by no means the only tool one can use to create maintainable code, and certainly shouldn't be the only one.
I live in Charlotte and write web applications in Python! I don't have a degree and didn't have much prior experience but I had a pretty extraordinary circumstance (won't say much more about it or where I work than that). I keep an eye on the job market for similar stuff here -- most jobs require either degree or substantial experience in the field, but maybe you can find an exception like I did.
Absolutely. For that budget you could get a desktop AND a laptop that are reasonably beefy. I do most of my development on a refurbished HP that I spent like $300 on incl. a new m.2 512GB SSD. Do you want Windows, Linux, or MacOS? They can all do Python development but the price point is different. Boils largely down to preference. My normal routine for buying something is to get the "best of" from a few years ago and then upgrade it myself. But if you aren't as familiar with the inner workings that isn't as easy. 
Behind the scenes, those are mostly C, C++, and Fortran. That said, you're writing high-performing Python code when you use any of them. You could, in theory, write a C++ game engine, make Python bindings for it, and have an impressive game written in Python.

Hey! I’m looking for windows. I want to learn for scripting and then eventually creating tools for maya. Any specifics on hardware I should look out for. I was looking at the acre spin 13 
Take a step back from languages and grab a 101 book in system design and analysis. Learn the fundamentals to object oriented. Learn the fundamentals client server architecture. Learn the fundamentals to data structures. Learn the fundamentals to networking and base protocol like Ethernet TCP/IP and UDP. Pop into a web course for Georgia tech or MIT on machine learning (just for high level understanding). Like other have stated - learn some CS foundation to the principles in conjunction with trying to perfect a language. In my second year of college I remember when the “light clicked on” for me was when taking both C++ and Assembly in parallel- 3 months of RISC architecture and learning how to perform a simple assembly project asking for input, iterating from 0 to that input, calculating if it was. a prime number, and then outputting that to command line. ....Trust that this 5 minute project in python was truly appreciated in assembly having to handle dynamically sizing buffers and how easy math was when dealing with binary :-) Plus knowing how and when to in-line assembly is a skill set you will always appreciate. If 6 months is your timeline - break it down into goals for each week, with major goals every month, so you have a dedicated plan. I think this is doable as long as you have the right people to surround yourself with. Take a look at your community colleges and poke your head into a CS professors office - I bet they are willing to help!
Very nice! Random question - what are your goals before your first major version release? I see you are on 0.3.0, and I'm just curious as to what thresholds you set for yourself.
Your csv file probably only has 4 columns. row[4] would reference the fifth column of your csv file.
I’ve thought about looking into a cs degree down the road my only fear is that I won’t be able to get it fast enough to land a job and I’ll have to return to a field I know. I will take another look at how much is gave to complete for the degree because I do have 3 years of college back when I was younger. Can’t remember what all I took though. Lol 
Nah it’s windows 10. It’s just also a tablet if you flip it. This one specifically https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/model/NX.GR7AA.012
No it's some program that's not military called SFS. Another one of my friends got his school paid for by the military though.
Nah it’s windows 10. It’s just also a tablet if you flip it. This one specifically https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/model/NX.GR7AA.012
Yes, working on a large project with lots of people is incredibly rewarding. Doubly so when some of the others have skills totally different from your own and together you make something neither could even totally understand.
This is an important point and should be near the top. RDR2 comes from a long lineage of game engines that has been in active development by an army of master craftsmen for over twelve years. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockstar_Advanced_Game_Engine
I didn’t mean to imply get a degree! Haha The fundamentals are all you should be after in addition to python. I would create two 6 month plans you would do in parallel. One based on principles and theory The second based on python Instead of trying to recreate the wheel - get to a CS prof. and bounce your goals and plans off of- I bet dollars to donuts they will point you in the right direction for self study. Also try to get into a google summer of code or something similar to be part of a project- also join github/ bit bucket - when you go into an interview you will have something to point to.
Yeah you can do Python on that no problem. Processor is a little on the weaker side but it should be okay. The only thing I'd worry about are the hinges if you use it in tablet mode but maybe those are more sturdy than they used to be.
This is the same thing I tell my friends who are trying out get into these silly boot camp programs. $10k to learn some Javascript, which they could have done online themselves, and they leave with no understanding of data structures or how to actually build something like an engineer. 
Computer security really interests me. No experience in it just the idea of it. I hope in the future I could do something like that. I’ve thought about going airforce and getting a degree that way.
did someone say something about new languages?
That's a very good question. &amp;#x200B; I am super happy with the Animation/Timeline/Block layout of the API that I have, so it should be fairly stable moving forward, but I don't yet want to lock myself out of being able to make small API breaking changes. &amp;#x200B; I think it's mostly a matter of adding new "blocks" to make more types of animations easier (specifically blocks for animating labels/titles/axis limits), and improving the interface of the current blocks. I also really want to add proper blitting support. I've experimented with blitting, but it has some issues with the interactive elements. I'm also a little unsure of what I want to do with the animations subpackage. I originally intended for it to be an interface to skip having to use the blocks directly, but I'm not sure that that would be a great API.
The reason why some packages vendor other packages is to ensure they're working a specific version but also not prevent users from installing a different version. I don't necessarily agree with it, but that's why. As for the pypi infrastructure bit, I'm not even sure what that means since pypi is a package repo. 
So when you're talking about how to make a large scale application, you're talking about how all the different systems work together, you're talking about the engine. Now, there's no 'universal' understanding about how to make a game engine, but there are some mostly agreed upon *practices* about how to make a *good* game engine. Probably the most important consideration from an software architecture view, is keeping your systems separate from each other to some degree. To *what degree* and *how* you keep systems separated, is largely a matter of taste and training. This is very helpful, because it limits how much of the code you have to have 'loaded into your head' when working on one thing or another. For example, let's say you have a player object, you obviously need to draw it on the screen somehow. So you write some system to handle drawing the player to the screen. But how does the rendering system know *where to draw the player?* Does it have access to the player object directly? Does the player object communicate to the rendering system where it is? Or is there some go between that the renderer can use? What happens if you need to change something in the renderer, do you need to change the player object too? **A Game Engine** defines *what* those systems are and *how* they 'talk' to each other. So here's your answer beyond 'time and money'. Smart engineers figured out how to break a complex simulated world into a variety of subsystems (Physics, Weather, Time, Entities, etc), and then designed a way for these systems to communicate to one another. Once the systems have been defined, it is much simpler to have teams specialize on one aspect of the game. The team writing your rendering code, probably do not have to know that much about how animal AI works in order to draw an animal on the screen, and vice versa. If you want to learn more about what goes on behind the scenes in a game engine, you can check out the definitive work on the topic, [Game Engine Architecture](https://www.amazon.com/Game-Engine-Architecture-Jason-Gregory/dp/1568814135). But you could actually figure out a lot on this on your own simply by thinking about the problem of separating your game systems on a code level, *how do you decide where to draw the player* for example, and then referring to common programming patterns to see what structures might serve that purpose. To that end [Game Programming Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Game-Programming-Patterns-Robert-Nystrom/dp/0990582906/) does an excellent job demoing how to structure code on a tactical level.
This looks pretty neat. I've been using `pipenv` to manage my projects. Could you please expand on the differences between `poetry` and `pipenv`? When would I want to choose one over the other? Thanks!
Django?
If you can find a good program, you can learn enough foundations to give you a boost and continue to learn from there. 
Can confirm that tech support is a great way to get started with a career in IT. My partner had a history degree but taught himself enough to get a level one helpdesk role. From there he learnt enough on the job and in his time at home to move into a dev ops role and now works in information security, he's done some certification stuff through work but no formal study in his field. 
I hate to poopoo. But you should at least go in to this with the right expectations. Over sixty percent of "entry level" developer jobs ask for two years experience. They also ask for a degree in a technical field, at least a four year degree preferring a masters degree. When I finished my four year degree I decided to get my masters shortly after. Because after months of applications, I never got a call back. I already worked at a national laboratory, who wouldn't keep me if I didn't get my masters. It is unlikely that after six months of home school, you'll get the job you think you will get. It is however possible that the experience you gain can be helpful in your quest. I think you would be better off getting into a tech support job, while trying to continue your education as well. The experience will mean more than six months of learning python on your own. When I applied for a job working with super computers, the man doing my interview said my experience at Geek Squad was very valuable to them. Anything helps. If you really want a job in software development I would say you really need to get a degree. Not because I think you have to, but because people who hire people are told that you have to. Last but not least, python is not enough to "bet it all on" in the world of software development. You will likely want to get experience in a few languages to be marketable. I would say C/C++, python, and Java would be a good start. As much as I don't like Java, I see job ads for it everywhere. The road you are trying to get on will take longer than six months. But if you can use that six months to find a more reasonable job working IT at a stable 40 hours a week it will make it possible to study, make a living, and get experience. This will also help you get an idea of what the work is like. Truth is, this kind of work isn't for everyone. Sometimes I'm not even sure this kind of work is for me lol. But I'm too deep to get out now. I hope this helps. And I hope that you do well, and enjoy the new life style. Good luck!
Thank you I appreciate it!
If you just want to code, it's easy and fast. I would say for Python you can write cool code in 6 months. If you want to write good code, then it's more than just language A or B. There are data structures, algorithms, patterns, networking, computer architecture... which takes years to learn.
Hell yea.
Python is a means to an end; not a thing you have that makes you amazeballs, like Mjolnir. What are you looking to DO? Data science, dev ops, web back end, ETL pipelines? You don't necessarily have to know now, but if you are down for classes maybe you should. I started out automating product diagnostics on the command line and now use Django and REST APIs to achieve similar results in a web UI.
&gt; Poetry comes with an exhaustive *dependendency* resolver, which will always find a solution if it exists. Bit of a typo there. :)
Search for a python bootcamp. 
I think a lot of people go for front-end and not many people do back-end so there could be an advantage there.
Seriously! I work at a smaller studio right now and we have one of the most competent QA teams I've ever seen. It makes all the difference - when they understand game mechanics, how they are designed to work, and then are able to write good detailed bugs - resolving them can sometimes feel like a walk in the park. 
Hey dude, I want to give you some advice that really helped me out when I was in your position. &amp;#x200B; Start applying to jobs now, with your resume saying you have 6 months of self taught experience, and your looking for any sort of junior level position where you can learn on the job. Mix up certain things on your resume to see how much it takes to get call backs. Send out a resume that says you've been a junior python developer for a year. &amp;#x200B; Also, If you've only been working construction you probably don't realize there are white collar jobs where you spend two hours actually working and 6 hours staring at reddit. &amp;#x200B; If you have 3 months of python and can do useful office things, these types of jobs will snap you up. You spend another 9 months at that job learning python for 6 hours a day or more if you hustle after work and build up a portfolio of useful projects. (Expect a pay cut, it sounds like you earn \~70k, these bs jobs pay \~40k.) &amp;#x200B; Now you actually have that year of experience and can hold your own while applying for junior positions. &amp;#x200B; You transition one step at a time. But maybe you end up somewhere else in the IT industry. There are a lot of other weird niche jobs in IT you've never heard of and they can pay great. Coding is useful outside of IT as well.
Get a CS degree at a university. You are 23 which makes you an independent according the the FAFSA. This means you can get grants and loans usually enough to pay for all your tuition and living expenses. It’s sounds like you are very new to the whole world of programming and may be underestimating what is involved in even an “entry level” job. Just fill out the FAFSA and apply to some schools you think you will be competitive. Matriculate Fall 2019. If your parents are allowing you to move back then this should be easy as pie. 
It is 1000% up to your commitment. Coding is not for everyone right out of the box, so the frustrations may be larger for some than others. It's possible that having done "real manual work", you'll have a real advantage in the sticking to it part. There is no shortage of free resources to learn any programming language online, but I learn a lot more by _doing_ than by _reading_, so I always tell people to follow along by typing every bit of code shown in examples in videos or books. This is an awesome way to have the experience of "writing good code" without having to do any thinking. You will develop a sense memory of where things go and how they should look.
New to it is probably an understatement. 😅 but I got to start somewhere. 
Pipenv only replaces pip &amp; virtualenv, not setuptools; Poetry replaces all three
Yeah the type of job I have now doesn’t have lunch or breaks, no real schedule, just work and work. I’m so tired of it. I need to study before I could convince someone I have more experience than I do lol 
/u/SDisPater
I absolutely agree. it's tough to find good resources. Here's a few tips I've found helped me a lot with Unity: * Abstract anything from the platform behind an interface/adapter object. This is the biggest thing to make your code testable. Not having to worry about the platform when writing tests makes things so much easier. If your adapters are nothing but pass-throughs to the actual engine calls, you don't have to test them since at that point you're really just testing the engine. It's extra boilerplate but it makes it MUCH easier to test client code. * Remember to lean towards a component-driven design vs. an OOP one. As backwards as it sounds, having OOP style coding can be a pain rather than a boon in the 3d world of objects constantly spawning into and out of existence. * I like to think of the game world in the editor as my sort of pseudo "DI Container". I write all my components in a way that their dependencies are injected properties, and in some cases relying on a global object pool to retrieve them if they don't exist at runtime. In Unity, even private class properties can be annotated such that they can have objects tied to them in the editor (It's not as ideal as constructor injection, but that's not really an option). So I'll be able to wire dependencies up in the editor at run time, and during testing I can rely on setter properties and/or some kind of service locator that you can inject mock implementations into. * I find that games are probably one of the most opportune areas to test ones ability to write code that's highly **adaptable**, since the requirements in game design change far more drastically, in general, than that of a standard CRUD app. Ironically, game code tends to be some of the least adaptable code I've ever seen. Nonetheless, the point stands that you can help YOURSELF in the future by trying to think of things in as abstract a way as is sensible. You have a friendly and enemy ship that can fire lasers at each other? Don't write a `Ship` class that has methods like "fireWeapon"/"takeDamage"/etc. Rather, `Ship` might just have a health property that can respond to/send out events regarding its state. And weapons are behind an `IShooter` interface with an `Shooter` implementation component that doesn't care what object it's attached to. It just fires shoot events. And the same ships could have a component that implements `ITargetable` which listens for those events and emits `IGotShot` events when shots come in. Then `Ship` can listen to those events and manage its own health, and now you have the building blocks of a firing system for any other type of object in the game. And to cut off the people who will inevitably call me out on the dangers of performance WRT event-driven design like this, I'll say the same thing I say to everyone who invariably comments on it: If it feels like it's becoming a problem, profile it. Don't just assume a design isn't going to be performant, and certainly don't shy away from more adaptable, readable, maintainable code just because a less robust design *might* be more performant. Performance doesn't matter until it does. Now, when it does, it tends to matter A LOT, so yeah in those circumstances, optimize the design to support the performance needs of the situation, but dont do so prematurely at the cost of clean code. &lt;/soapbox&gt;
Can be done, but would have issues regarding stability and security. SSH is great for text data streams, I am not so sure about how it would handle file transfers.
i would agree that the extra layer complicates things if there are issues. i have done a tiny amount of JS but only for we sites, which i mostly don't do. when i have, JS seemed easy enough.. i could do more if i had the need.
Good luck OP. DM me if you need any help or are stuck with anything. I am a programmer, have been doing this for 12+ years, and others say I am fairly good at what I do, so I think I am qualified to help.
What do you do exactly? 
since switch to python 3.7.0, pip3 may not work in the ENV_DIR, you need to run `pyvenv --upgrade ENV_DIR`
There's is no replacement for a solid bachelor or graduate program in computer science. When I first started at uofm I thought it was a big waste of money. But then in my second semester a professor, that i am still close with, told me to "stop looking at all that i had learned and to start filling the gaps of what I had not learned in school." My graduate degree taught me a ton, but the suplamental graduate assistance programs and self projects are what really got me to where I am today.
&gt; what I need to learn to land a job but my goal it to move to Charlotte NC. If you're devoted to one city you're in trouble... if you're willing to relocate in general you can make this work.
I’m willing to move anywhere but the end goal would be there. 
It's good that you've decided to dedicate yourself to changing careers and learning something new, but it might not be necessary to set yourself that limit of 6 months in an all or nothing manner? It sounds like you haven't written a single line of code yet and don't have a clue what it's even all about. Start learning today instead, get at least half an hour in a day, I'm sure you can squeeze that out if you're really that serious about this, but get a feel for what you plan to go all in with. There's something very familiar to me about that approach of "when the time comes, I will go all in, 100% commitment". I learned that if you haven't been building up to that for a while, it's just nothing but a pretty thought that gives you some good feelings about a hopeful future. When the time comes, there's a good chance you'll get kicked in the face by the reality of what you are really doing, contrasted with what you imagined it as. That version of ourselves which we imagine as perfectly doing what we want to once the time comes doesn't exist, you only have what you've gathered so far and if you've gathered 0 coding experience, you might want to start there first before making these hail mary decisions out of frustration with your life. If you have gotten the first failures out of the way, if you've been humbled by the true reality of the task you plan to take on, once you realize how much learning there is to be done and how much of it will be nothing but painful if forced the way you plan to, and still find it something you want to succeed in after it all sinks in a bit more, then think about quitting your job and going all in. 
&gt; Doing data analysis with python is very lucrative and very in demand, most definitely. I think it's worth noting that it's in demand because people cannot pick up those skills in 6 months. I would not recommend breaking into the data analytics field to a construction worker with no experience. I think web dev is the way to go, maybe IT, to get started.
Very very impressive. 
I'm surprised to see the resoponses here, everyone is making it seem like it's not possible unless you go with some kind of web based solution. I use my bottom of the line chromebook (https://www.asus.com/ca-en/Commercial-Laptops/ASUS_Chromebook_C201/) to code all the time, primarily with python. All my experience is sorta centered around enjoyment and competence on the command-line, so keep that in mind. I recommend the [Secure Shell App](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell-app/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo) for your shell, it's nicer than the built-in one. You actually have tons of options when doing development on a chromebook, depending on the specific device you have and what you're trying to do with it. You can use [crouton](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton) to essentially dual-boot into regular linux distros that you may be more familiar with like Ubuntu or Debian. You can install an alternate OS like [GalliumOS](https://wiki.galliumos.org/Installing), although only if you have an x86 chromebook (Mine is ARM, so I can't try it.) I prefer to just stay in ChromeOS, most everything I try to do I can manage just fine. [Chromebrew](https://github.com/skycocker/chromebrew) is a nice piece of software to allow you to install all kinds of dev tooling really easily. And even if it's missing something, it'll typically get you close enough that you have the tools to compile and install anything else that you may want from source. If you have any specific questions I'd be happy to try and point you to some options.

IMO its more so the "interface" aspect, rather than classes themselves. You could do things functionally, but if you have things broken down into packages, it makes things easier.

Before posting to ANY subreddit you should read the sidebar and decide if the subreddit is appropriate, that's why. As the 'bot suggested below /r/learnpython is the subreddit for questions about python, but your question may also be answered in /r/laptop. If you post to the wrong subreddit expect to be flamed or, at least, ignored.

I automated entering myself into the daily Amazon giveaways. Definitely not a "polished" solution, but does well 99% of the time. I posted the code on github here: [https://github.com/stateofidleness/amazon-giveaway-bot](https://github.com/stateofidleness/amazon-giveaway-bot)
I would suggest you be careful. Most developers go to school for 4 years (6 for masters, albeit about 1/3 of that time is spent with gen-ed stuff) to become developers. With internships, professor recommendations, school connections, and grades have a hard time finding a job. Not necessarily because of lack of skills but simply because there's always someone better. Just keep in mind what you're going up against. I definitely would not make learning python (or any language) a replacement full-time job. Find another job to supplement your savings and don't rush yourself. Also, learning just python isn't enough. I work a giant development company and I would say, generously, that maybe 5% of the software we make is python. Javascript is real hot right now. Used for all kinds off stuff. Javascript also pairs well with Python. TL;DR: Be careful. Dedicate yourself. Don't bite off more than you can chew.
Okay, hear me out on this : This doesn't seem like a good idea. It took me a couple of months to get the grasp of python, and a couple more to get into OOP and actually write efficient code. I always had a passion for CS though, and a previous knowledge of C and C++. I got a job two years later. So 6 months is a little short of a deadline. Plus, if you're only starting out in CS, there's no guarantee you're actually going to like it, or be good at it. It takes a certain mindset to program. Not trying to discourage you with that last one, but I've seen PLENTY of people trying to get into CS only to leave shortly after because they can't grasp the thought process of how to code.

Just like any job, who you know can be a big help. I learned programming in university and got my first job via reference from a friend who I worked on a group project with before. Having someone who can vouch for you being a competent programmer is great. Also, when I see coworkers evaluating prospective hires, the first thing I see is them trying to find someone currently working for the company that knows the person. If they say one negative thing about the person, their chances of hiring are almost completely forfeit. So try to be civil and don't burn any bridges along the way.
I made a bi-directional sync tool in python + ssh + rsync. Check out [PyFiSync](https://github.com/Jwink3101/PyFiSync)
Script to create Jira epic and all related issues/subtasks that make up our "project plan." Takes prompts for certain values to be used in summary and description. The "plan" is built as a JSON vs. being in code so that we can more easily flex/change it as other uses come up.
&gt; for some reason you just don't want to admit it. I’ve already explained exactly why I think they don’t care about performance, but for some reason you don’t want to understand it. &gt; A shallow view of how project priorities work does not an accurate view make. Neither does ignoring fundamental decisions that make good performance and efficiency basically impossible. I wonder why you persist in doing so. 
What's the story with Ubisoft, and lack of a QA team?

I’ve met lots of “security” guys in the enterprise who don’t know how to program. They are glorified administrators, they just make up policies for the organization based on checklists published by someone else. Real computer security involves hacking, which is mostly just reverse-engineering, which requires an incredibly in-depth knowledge of what a computer is doing behind the scenes.
Adam?
No sir. 
Oh ok sorry thought your story sounded really similar to one of my old students. 
So the question I have is: after 6 months, how do you convince a hiring manager to give you a junior dev job without any experience or a relevant formal education. Getting that first job that lets you get your foot in the dooris going to be a challenge. Have you thought about hollow to navigate it? 
Good luck man
There guys who just go through checklists can still make bank though.

Aww shame. Hopefully you find some luck. Assuming you used Python and Selenium?

Its true what some people here say, you do need to know a lot of stuff to land a decent job. But! Those knowledge are acquired as you go, and even if you don't have all the knowledge of a CS major, you can still accomplish great things. Some of the best programmers I know didn't even study CS or Engineering.
Try quantopian.com . They have preinstalled working environment and historical data for free. They tutorials is a good start.
I guess I would be "real" security to you then. But the "glorified administrators" you just described don't belong in quotes. Creating security and privacy policies is incredibly difficult and useful. They work hard, and just because you can't compile their work doesn't mean you can take away from it.
I am sure it’s important work but I am skeptical of security by policy. The same way I am skeptical of zero tolerance policies at schools. It can be too blunt an instrument sometimes. 
[removed]
They do. All of them. But, unit and integration tests don't necessarily catch everything that might be 'wrong'. It's perfectly possible to have great code coverage with that stuff, pass them 100%, yet the game is actually totally broken. That's why you have QA and play testing.
/r/learnpython xlrd is also for older excel files. it looks like you want to use openpyxl if is an `xlsx` file http://www.python-excel.org/
It unpacks the collection so that each element becomes a (positional) argument to the function.

Ohh.. Like \*args... We can put in any number of positional arguements??

Author of Poetry here :-) &amp;#x200B; You can get an idea of some differences here: [https://github.com/sdispater/poetry#what-about-pipenv](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry#what-about-pipenv) &amp;#x200B; But the gist of it is: Poetry reduces everything you need to manage your Python project (application or library) to one standardized file, being dependency management or publishing if you need it. It also has a much faster and accurate dependency resolver.
Is poetry work well using with dockerfile?

Was in your same position. 23, broke in debt, borrowed from then girlfriend, depressed and suicidal. Took up Python. 24 now, making 75k a year. Started from 48, then went to 60, then 75. All in a year. Starting salary for a bachelor's in my country is 40k. I'm making much much more than degree holders here now, lots of envy from my cousins and current course mates who are still studying for their degree, oh I dropped out of college at 23. Could be an inspiration or who knows. But I built lots and lots of project, also I didnt start from scratch, I did knew VBA and C++ and mql5 and have worked in projects and as a SE before I went to college. Just took the wrong course, I wanted something stable like materials engineering, when I started the course, Programming wasn't a thing in my country yet. I dropped that and did my own gig (start-up) failed because I got broke, overworked and in debt to continue, then went to pick up Python and data science in a boot camp. Now I'm making double what fresh grads from the top 3 uni here would make. Also paid off all my loans and students loans, and my now wife is also debt free, we are home owners, married and have a baby on the way. 1 year really does make a big difference! Looking back at my Reddit history, I was suicidal just 8 months ago, having been sent to a mental hospital and attempted suicide 2 years before, and subsequent attempted suicides too. In the US, I don't know what's the average pay there but if college CS grads start off at 80k, I imagine I'm making the relative equivalent of 160k. My wife is a gifted ivy league holder and has supported me throughout the way and got married with me when I had nothing, we make the same amount now, even though she has been working for years more.
Heya! I started from basics and got couple of distant-learning courses to get certificates first + codecamps. The more you code, the more experience and practical skill you get.
There are a few cloud IDEs out there. Repl.it is a popular one. Another good one to check out is Cloud9. I used it a lot before it got bought out by AWS, I'm not entirely sure what it's like now. Cloud IDEs are pretty cool as your whole development environment is portable and often they're set up to run your code on micro cloud instances so they're really easy to hack away on anywhere you've got an internet connection.
I don't have a job but I know an app that's called Sololean and that helps!
The unpacking is of self.theta.shape which will be a tuple like `(10, 30)` which will be unpacked and used as the arguments for randn. That is np.random.randn(*(10,30)) which is the same as no.random.randn(10,30).
With python?
Since its a part of a 160 line code... I'm not sure how to try it
What type(s) does np.zeroes() accept? What type is self.y? What type is self.y.shape?

Would an accredited course from a reputable college on Edx help OP? Just thinking they are cheaper than college education and can be done in their own time? 
Np is numpy Self.y is a matrix
So in our case np.zeros(self.y.shape) will fill zeros in the shape of self.y which will like (10,20) matrix and it becomes (0,0) And np.zeros(self.y) will fill each and every value in thw 10,20 matrix with 0 Right???
A couple of ideas I've not seen here yet. ( I run a dev team of 11 developers / researchers in python and we have another team comprised of mostly students for short projects). learn skills that will make you valuable from day 1, skills that any team lead will want to have someone on the team with regardless for pure coding skills. know GIT (and the specifics of github/bitbucket/gitlab). know JIRA / trello etc. i.e., know them better than anyone else, how to make dashboards etc. How to cherry pick commit when someone else eff's up. ELK stack, graphite/grafana. Learn how to make slack bots. making basic Jenkins jobs. granted knowing the above is a NOC/devops/automation skill but having them will get you a leg up in almost any dev position.
Sftp is kinda failure isn't it?
&gt; np.zeros(self.y) will fill each and every value in thw 10,20 matrix with 0 Test it. It'll crash.
Self.y will create a matrix that has as many dimensions as y has elements, although you'll get an error beyond 32
Thanks!!! Btw did you read my above answer?
Then I definitely agree with u/enigmaticMachine with the quantopian.com recommendation. However, I'm not sure what kind of futures data they have available for testing. 
I don't mind even if they don't have any data for testing as I have all the necessary data in my computer
You have such a wonderful wife and so the life.
There is some great advice, and caution, in this thread. That said, here are some immediate steps you can take towards your 6 month plan: 1. create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account (use this for *any* learning projects, to show the world you an active coder) 2. find a [beginner-friendly open-source project](https://up-for-grabs.net/#/tags/python) and get involved (fix the docs, verify an issue, open your first PR, etc.) 3. involve yourself in *supportive* community, such as [CodeBuddies](https://codebuddies.org/) and [PythonistaCafe](https://www.pythonistacafe.com/). 4. find at least one *comprehensive* Python course (don't relegate yourself to rando tutorial vids) and complete it. For a comprehensive course, consider anything by [Jose Portilla](https://www.udemy.com/user/joseportilla/), such as * [Complete Python 3 Masterclass Journey](https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-3-masterclass-journey/) * [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/)
Just lost an hour of my life clicking through those... Got nothing.
This, this and then more of this... is how i started out with a languages degree... tech support taught me a lot about IT and i used that knowledge every day as a python dev, i don't know how it compares to an actual engineering degree but i taught myself on the job and the engineering graduate new hires we got looked up to me
Another thing to consider is to take short break or apply to universities that gives admissions with scholarship's - maybe this sub can help you to find them.
Yes, there is. Calling `np.random.randn((10,30))` will give it a single parameter with the value `(10, 30)` (a 2-element tuple). Calling `np.random.randn(*(10,30))` gives it two parameters with the value `10` and `30`.
Who said I was using this? All I did was answer this person’s question
I've never used it, but a friend has used [https://github.com/backtrader/backtrader](https://github.com/backtrader/backtrader) for some development of trading strategies. He's definitely more advanced in Python than I am, so not sure about the learning curve when using it. 
Knowing why something smells doesn't make it smell less. Pypi is infrastructure. The problem is that there isn't a clean separation between the package repository itself and pip. This is what cause some of the vendorizing, and when pip changes, things tend to break. Having a public API to pypi would make it a lot easier for 3rd parties. 
What do you refer by "parameter" ??
Ow sorry, didn’t mean to offend anyone
Hey, I'm a manager that deals with A TON if entry level employees, so this is a familiar topic for me. If you hate your job, you need to find something you don't hate. No question. And you've got a plan and savings, so you're way ahead of lots of people who pull the trigger on changing careers. But you've also got a lot of optimism, which can be dangerous. You need to assume that things won't go as planned, and build your plan with that in mind. There are a lot of good bits of advice in here, but the best ones I read were 1) figure out the job market, 2) figure out what you want to do (and what jobs you're willing to do along the way), and 3) get organized. If I could add to them, I would say you need to find a part time job to stretch your savings into at least a year, and sure the time becoming competent in a handful of popular languages (if it was me, I'd go after Python, JavaScript, Java, and maybe some basic HTML and CSS). Not an expert, just capable of writing functioning programs. This will make you more employable, help prevent you getting burned out, and give you some time to build up a GitHub. It will also give you some time to figure out what interests you and where your talents lie. It's not unusual to find that language X doesn't really click, but something else unexpectedly does. Good luck! It won't be easy, and self study isn't going to make your climb faster. Technology is one career where formal education isn't always as important actually skill, but both are definitely preferred, so you're going to have to prove you're a good risk. 
I myself am a civil engineering advisor and learned python myself. Currently I'm trying to get more people into Python and in civil engineering there is a lot that can be automated with python. Half a year is probably to short (took me about 3 to 4 years) but you might find a job at an engineering firm where you can learn on the job.
It's probably because there's an update to the library and render this function obsolete
Due respect, but your timelines seem a bit short. E.g. learning Django or JavaScript in one week or CSS in 3 days. Also, people don't need to build their own PC or install Linux to work in tech.
 def add(x, y): return x + y `x` and `y` are the parameters of `add`. You can call it as `add(1, 2)`, or as `add(*(1, 2))`. That second way isn't useful here, but when it comes to functions that take varying numbers of parameters or times that you want to put all of a function's parameters in a single variable it's useful.
Have you looked into lambda school?
Not to brag or anything, but my package [oscilloscope](https://github.com/pycampers/oscilloscope) lets you build that kind of view in ~20 LOC. And, it only eats up ~7% CPU on my 2 core machine.

If you can jailbreak it (i.e. not locked down like some schools are doing) take a look at crouton (it has been awhile since I played in that space so there maybe better alternatives now)
This this so much. Burnouts are worse than you think and you get them quicker than you expect... ESPECIALLY if money is on the line. Please be careful and try to have a backup plan. I had a similar revelation and quit my job to go to uni for cs (europe so very lucky with cheap unis). Even though I had my partner and parents who could help out financially and found a job very quickly it was still a very close call trying to juggle everything while also worrying about money. Its a very deep, rewarding but at the same time very draining profession, so take care.
Do you mean a project on pypi with C extensions or the project where I am currently working?
Can't agree with this more. Most people that have invested the time into learning this did it out of a passion for technology. You have to be practically obsessed with what you're working on. Haunted by difficult problems and driven by finding solutions. Sleepless nights aren't a burden, they're part of the process. Most people who are successful would be doing what they do even if they weren't getting paid, because they want to. It's that kind of desire to know more that leads to success. Everyone I know who has wanted to learn in order to be successful has given up. Programming is about failure. Constant, frustrating, confusing failure. The need to find an answer or figure something out has to be greater than the feelings that failing many many times can bring. You're not going to be able to keep the drive and determination necessary to be successful if your goal is to simply be successful. There is no greater teacher than failure, but what you learn may be different than what you had hoped. 
You can also study in an online university.Check this webpage: [https://www.uopeople.edu/programs/cs/degrees/computer-science-bachelor-degree-2/](https://www.uopeople.edu/programs/cs/degrees/computer-science-bachelor-degree-2/)
I can’t disagree more. (But I used to 100% think the same thing!) I am a professional python dec with a bout 15 years exp. over the last sever I have seen more and more “unconventional background” developers join the ranks, and this is a good thing! Diverse teams build better product! I have seen a ton of people go through these hacker schools and find great success on the other side with just three months of intense study. Do they have the same knowledge as someone with a four year degree? No. But you don’t need to be a computer scientist to do most web programming. Also, there is a world of jobs that do not require JS (even for entry level). I don’t know it and hope I never need to. I say go for it and good luck! Hacker schools can be worth it for the job placement connections so check them out.
/rushnmob , They have one minute data with solid history. Nice thing about quantopian is that you don't have to build your own backtester. They using anaconda package with jupyter notebook. You can try many things with it. Even machine learning with scikit-learn.
All the languages that I know of initialise “line 1”, read in from a text file, as lst[0]. In other words, the list-type variable called “lst” starts at element “0”. That means if you have “x” lines of data to read in, the final element of “lst” will be lst[x-1]. Useful shorthand: if you ever want the last element of a list, use lst[-1].
yeah, apparently it's much easier to set up a development environment on linux than on windows
Assuming you aren't discouraged by the people telling you this is a bad idea, 6 months is enough time. Here is my suggestion: 1. Learn how to code. Read/watch beginners tutorials. Pretty simple. Check out [Sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex) and [Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5) on youtube for beginner stuff. This will probably take a good chunk of time. At 8 hours a day, you can set a decent foundation in 2-3 weeks. 2. Learn git. It isn't hard, and putting your work on github is step one to getting hired. 3. Take a day or two to learn HTML and JSON. There are 8 million resources for them, and they are super simple. 4. Learn about back-end web dev. Follow the [Flask Mega tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH) flask video tutorial. It doesn't matter if you totally understand everything the first time through, and honestly you should go through them both. I would start with the video tutorial, and move on to the mega tutorial. This will take the most time. You could easily spend the entire 6 months learning about flask and back end web dev. Ultimately, I would suggest going through each tutorial once, and then making your own website with what you've learned. Host it on digital ocean (or wherever tbh), and you can use that when you try to get hired. Depending on where you live, you might have a lot of trouble finding a job. Also, you will almost certainly be making less money when you start out than you do working 80hr/wk in construction.
Post the entire program.
&gt; data analytics, cybersecurity, or back end web development Maybe it's just me, but I feel like backend web development is way easier to get into than data analytics and cybersecurity. I've never met a data analyst or cybersecurity employee that didn't have at minimum a 4 year degree, but I know many backend web devs that are self-taught. Obviously anecdotal; just my two cents!
[/u/SDisPater](https://www.reddit.com/u/SDisPater) I had a quick experiment with poetry in a VM running Ubuntu 18.10 server and encountered the following. I probably would have got better results with the LTS (18.04). You assume that python and pip are available. In this case only python3 was present. I installed python-pip3 and created links for python and pip. I had to install the distutils &amp; python3-venv packages to get the basic poetry commands to run. I experimented with installing a couple of modules. At one point, I removed notebook and then removed matplotlib. It appeared that notebook (plus dependencies) was reinstalled as part of the uninstall of matplotlib. I don't have evidence of this, it was probably my error. The attempt to remove Jupyter failed when poetry tried to remove system packages. ~/.poetry/bin/poetry remove jupyter Updating dependencies Resolving dependencies...

David Fischer wrote some illuminating thoughts on signing packages: https://www.davidfischer.name/2012/05/signing-and-verifying-python-packages-with-pgp/ I was sure it was a good idea before; I'm not so sure now.
If I copy just what you posted there's no syntax error. The part right before it might be the problem.
You use something different than Python first of all
I think the current trend is away from OOP but it largely depends on use case. Many people get taught OOP at university and apply it to iol fitting problems. 
The error message is pretty clear: there is no iframe with id "content_ifr" in HTML. Check page code and if it's true, that's not a Python problem. 
I made and script that fetches bird data from the national ornithology institute in my country, combines it with pictures and data from Wikipedia and audio data from xeno-canto API and stores it in a database for a website I'm building, so yeah... I love Python because it was pretty easy
I couldn't disagree with this more. This sort of attitude is just enraging to me. Software development is not rocket science and **it certainly does not require a degree**. I've been rolling code for 19years now and the only formal education I have is a 10 month program that was largely a waste of money. I volunteer a lot of time in a Slack group for Python learners, many of which are in positions similar too that of /u/Jordan_From_Ga and I also teach Python for free to people here in Cambridge who are looking to expand their skills. I've worked with self-taught nerds like me as well as 4 year, MA, and PhD nerds. All have their strengths and weaknesses, but there's no correlation between the quality of one's code and their formal education. Indeed one of the the best coders I've ever worked with has a philosophy degree. Software engineering needs a personality type more than it needs training. It requires that you actually *enjoy* starting at code that doesn't work for hours, hacking at it until you win. Good programmers are creative and take great pleasure in elegant solutions that few, if any will ever understand let alone appreciate. They also need good social skills, being able to work with self righteous, arrogant people who lack people skills, as there's a disproportionate number of them in this field. You're right that 6 months is a short amount of time, but in the right cities, familiarity and jr-level experience with a language is all that's needed to get started. You have to be willing to work cheap for a couple years, but the barrier of a CS degree simply doesn't (and shouldn't) exist.
Christ I'm on my second Masters and still of an opinion that this is not enough for real correct data analysis. It's easy to analyse the data but making correct inferences from messy garbage is hard as god above. Understanding p vals different methods their strengths and weaknesses setting up experiments ets. Yeah.... 6 months I wish.
Either that web page updated or try after downloading latest web drivers
There is a public api for pypi, that's how poetry works, that's how pip works. 
And that's why pipenv failed because of a pip release. 
Please listen to the guy above. We understand you hate your job, but do not just quit. Is there a way you can ask to reduce your hours? This way you still have money coming in if shit really hits the fan. You could also speak to a few software companies in your area that develop in python and ask if you could do some work experience or something? What you need is development experience. 
On the road paving doesn’t do a normal 40, plus I’m 8 hours from home. 
Fair play
Regardless of being able to get a tech job I will be leaving this company. Just not for me anymore. I just want to get into tech and am willing to sacrifice to make that happen
Hey. I am the author and maintainer of this project.
Because I am curious why something like that would happen. No reason to act so pissed about it. When the system says " Message: no such element: Unable to locate element:" I already know there is iframe with content_ifr. I posted just to see if anyone knew more about why it would disappear all of a sudden. When you write a piece of code, run it a 100 times, get the same result and suddenly next morning it doesn't work at all do you not scratch your head as to why its nothing working all of a sudden? I've been running this code snippet for nearly 3 months now
I have but used AWS serverless and node for lambda. I can answer questions if you'd wanna PM me
Hi, Post the exact error you get. S
When I write a piece of code, run it 100 times, get the same result and suddenly the next morning it doesn't work at all, I don't scratch my head asking what happened. I debug. If nothing has changed, it means I don't handle all the cases or my error handling is crap. Either way, I sit to it and fix it. When I need help from Reddit surfers, I'm preparing by making a snippet of code causing problems and a sample of input data, so people can verify and run the code by themselves. And when someone tells me what is going on, I don't reply with "it worked before", but make it work again. I understand you may be pissed off by this situation, but this subreddit is not a good place to vent your frustration, mainly because nobody cares. We will be happy to help you with code, not your emotions. Respect our time, please.
who works 80hr/week? isnt that a lot ?
OP here: (derp, just realized my thread title is redundant...) I've been working on this little project lately. It's a decorator that turns your function signature into a `argparse`\-based command-line interface. It is not meant to be flexible and cover all cases, it is meant to be fast and easy for prototyping. Let me know what you think!
Disregarding some uninteresting for our situation cases, what happens when this: foo((1, 2)) code is interpreted: https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/object.html#c.PyObject_CallObject this function is called with a tuple of *length one*, whose first element is a tuple of *length two*, containing integers `1` and `2`. `PyObject_CallObject()` takes a `PyObject`, which it then treats as if it was of type `PyTupleObject`^1 (for reference: https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/tuple.html#c.PyTupleObject ). This is inefficient from interpreter's standpoint (because of the price you have to pay for allocating an extra Python object, destructuring it etc), but it is written in this way to allow calling functions with variable number of arguments *from Python code*. Splat operator will be interpreted by Python interpreter as an instruction not to construct wrapper tuple around arguments you pass to the function. ---- 1. It will actually treat it as if it was implementing https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/sequence.html sequence protocol, not calling tuple-specific methods, that's why you can also use this with `list` etc. `PyTupleObject` is just how it happens when you don't use splat.
Context: https://automatetheboringstuff.com
Do you still have that book? 
In addition to unpacking, from 3.6 on you can use it to create keyword-only arguments. Normally, keyword arguments can be passed as conditional arguments, but this way you can enforce keyword usage. def foo(positional, keyword=None): pass def bar(positional, *, keyword=None): pass You can call `foo(1, 2)`, but `bar(1, 2)` will raise an exception. You **have** to do `bar(1, keyword=2)`.
I need this in my life, like, yesterday.
docopt all the way.
Yes, docopt is a great project.
Quick question: Can poetry be used to decide which specific version to choose if multiple versions match requirements? I.e. can one tell it to choose the newest possible, or the oldest possible? I've been struggling with this with `pip`, and didn't really find a way to get it to do this. To the best of my knowledge, `pipenv` cannot do this either.
Why make a new one instead of contributing to an opensource one that is already widely used?
You're in a unique position. You have a trade. Go get your NICET. Learn programming too. Use your programming skills to make your job easier. Move up. I'm hold 3 NICET certs in fire protection. Buy the study books. Take the exams. It's job security. And an opportunity to work on a side hustle like programming. I'm taking my 2nd python course from udemy. I've moved up to sales. And I want to take my quoting template and make it a webpage that spits out proposals and people pay to use. As well as other ideas. Make your trade fund your passion.
I have worked with PhDs, masters, bachelors, and non formal education background. I have worked with an English teacher looking for a way out, a math teacher board with his life, a hair dresser from California looking for more. I can tell you from first had experience that you do not need a formal education to succeed. But 6 months as a timeline is way to short and I myself am enraged at the people who try to mislead the OP saying he can learn everything he need in python in that time, and juggle life, and find a job, and eveyother setback in life that comes around when your on that tight of a budget. I will give one shout out to formal education though I made a ton of contacts that I would have never got otherwise. I learned a lot of diverse subjects, I learned that amount of hard work goes in to team base code that I would not have got alone. A lot of people knock college cause of the price and I TOTALY agree, but man if you can front the price and you go to a good school it can be worth it.
Get an 8 hour a day job of any kind just to support yourself, then work on your python skills the rest of the day. Giving up your income entirely to pursue something with no leads is a bad idea. 
not with me currently but won't be a problem to get it back, but i didn't really enjoy learning from a book, would rather learn online

I love the enthusiasm here, but there is no way to do this and be professional by the end. At best, we are talking about could you get enough training to fake your way into a job and learn while working. Everyone learns on the job, that is the job in some ways. And everyone fakes it until they make it, but you still need to be a productive member of a team. You really need to teach yourself to solve problems, read docs, and think with software. Starting from scratch will take years. There is so much random cs content that you won’t know you don’t know. Even developers don’t fully appreciate how much this ambient knowledge they rely on. It’s a tough road. Start learning now, but keep your day job until you’re ready. 
That’s the best explanation I’ve seen for what game design looks like on the CS and engineering side of things.
Spammers say "thanks".
Generally speaking, because maintainers of existing open source solutions have other things to do than to read, critique, modify, discuss and approve a PR. Which will, by the way, only happen if they agree that what you're trying to do is a good idea in the first place, in principle and execution *and* has a place in their project. Merging a feature into an existing project is the ideal, but it's pretty hard to do in practice. Much easier to make your own and have people use that.
I have no opinion on Udemy.
You can find many tutorials online. Just google "python tutorial" and stick with the one you like the most. Books are better, because they force you to type code instead of copying and pasting. 
As a maintainer of a large opensource project, saltstack, I disagree. We regularly make PRs against libraries that we use in our modules in order to add features that are required by users. Just find the active library, there are two libraries that have releases in the last year that I found in 30 seconds. Or even better, contribute it to smtplib in stdlib https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html
Not all here likes Udemy due to some questionable business practices... However I bought that course(before finding //learnpython) and I am enjoying the content. It moves along in a structured way and teaches you the basics before moving into more advanced stuff. Disclaimer: Im not done with the course, but getting there (Started object-oriented programming).
You can easily fork during the merge wait time. So instead of writing your own you fork the existing. If the feature you're adding is a common ask it's usually not hard to get it merged.
Oh, I see. I suggest to use instance in this case. Something like: ``` with TimeThis() as timer: with timer: with timer: ```
Right now I have no open pull requests outside of saltstack projects. So basically 100% Also, pro tip on getting stuff merged, make sure what you are contributing to has tests and lint. Then add tests for your addition and that usually speeds up merging and releasing.
thanks you very much! i'm looking at another course now thinking about buying one of them, this one seems to be much longer [https://www.udemy.com/python-the-complete-python-developer-course/](https://www.udemy.com/python-the-complete-python-developer-course/) &amp;#x200B; ill probably buy one and start today, I didn't find anything as comprehensive on youtube and I like t he concept of the site, i'm pretty sure I know what business practices you were referring to, thanks anyway 
What? This is not a project-based feature. This is a source control feature. You can always fork a project. Always. 
We have done this in the past with the winrm-fs Ruby library for our test kitchen installs to pull down the unit test xml data after the test run. Just point the test requirements/Gemfile to our forked repo until upstream merges it.
&gt; no open pull requests outside of saltstack projects. So basically 100% So all PR you made got merged, except for the ones that didn't? I appreciate the tips, but they won't help if there is literally nobody to actually make the decision to merge. 
I've actually bought that one too! However i haven't started it yet. I just got sucked into Udemy's "Sale". Just pick one of them and get started - both of them teach the same and provide exercises to help you along. 
I thought forking and PRs were GitHub specific features 
Except for the ones that I am currently working on and opened in the last week.
PRs were created by GitHub, but before that git just has a feature called a request pull, where you request someone pull from your repository. Also to fork something just means to make another repo for it. You can does anything and just make a new source of truth and pull from there, GitHub/git is not required for that. You can fork anything.
Thanks for enlighting me 
Wow, this is fantastic! I really appreciate the time you took to write all this out, and I'm saving this comment!. Also, lol@\`IGotShot\`
Forking is no different than cloning a repo and pushing it to another repository you control. That's a git level feature. (Github is one git provider.) A pull request using github's UI would be specific to github. 
Sorry, it’s an internal project.
A lot of people have already given you good advice. I wouldn't quit working maybe find a job for less hours so you can study in your own time since your job now is too demanding. I would like to add: You don't know how to program so how do you know you will like it? This is the main reason why I wouldn't sacrifice your job to learn full time at this moment. Also I see you saying you want a cs degree but often people don't know what a cs degree is. You will code a lot but it is at least as much math and statistics as it is programming. &amp;#x200B; Overall its great that you want to change to a career that will make you happy you should go for it. But I would really try by learning and working and then try to get a low level tech job when you can. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
I'm glad it helps, just don't be stupid about it. Have a backup plan. Have a job or skillset you can fall back on if it doesn't work out (like I said, it's not for everyone), and/or family/friends who can put you up if you need it. Note also my comment about "in the right city". You're *much* more likely to find work as a junior-level nerd in San Francisco, New York, London, or Toronto than you are in Atlanta and remote gigs are usually reserved for experienced people. If you're not in a position to move to these places, you may find it takes a long time to even find an open job near you, let alone one you can get with so little experience. /u/DataDecay is right in that 6 months is a *very* short amount of time to give yourself to (a) pick up a skill and (b) try to find someone who will pay you for it. Without an adequate safety net (and you live in a country notorious for governments not giving a fuck about people) you put yourself at significant risk by choosing this course. What I wanted to drive home is that you don't need a CS degree to do this job, and my concern was with the suggestion that 6 months is not enough because you need a degree and that's at least 4 years. I assert that this isn't remotely true. However you do need the will to actually do the work (not just to make the money, but to actually willingly stare at code all day). This isn't for everyone and you'll know pretty soon in the process if it's for you. Critically, you also need the *opportunity*, and that can be hard to come by if you're geographically restricted. One of the smartest nerds in my Slack group is in the middle-of-nowhwere Texas and he's had a lot of trouble finding good work. In the end, it will come down to whether you can find someone willing to hire someone so light on the skills, and the odds of that happening are greater where there's more competition for nerds. Also note that there are slower, though safer and more responsible options available, such as any combination of: * Moving to one of the tech-heavy cities and finding work in your current field * Taking online (typically free) courses after work * Looking for local in-person training * Applying for government funding to get formalised education Any or all of these are a better choice than just dropping everything and trying to cram as much as you can into 6months with no income. Indeed most everyone I know who's been successful in this field having come from another one followed a few of these options rather than your proposed solution. Good luck, and if you'd like to drop by our Slack channel, send me a DM with your email address and I'll send you an invite. (Same goes to anyone else reading this!)
R.I.P Java. I love python &lt;3
&gt; What's wrong? Read the traceback. It will tell you exactly what line has the indentation error. There's no need to search the entire file: go directly to that line, remove the indent, and re-enter it. Only if you try that and the error doesn't go away should you care about investigating further. (By the way, Pastebin appears to replace your tabs with spaces, making it impossible to diagnose this error from Pastebin. And given that your code snippet is only eleven lines long, it is unnecessary, and even rude, to expect people to go visit another site instead of including your code directly in your post.) If your editor has a "Show whitespace" option, you can use it to see what the problem is. The most likely error is that you've accidentally entered a space in the middle of the indentation: `tab space tab` instead of `tab tab`, say. But why bother? Just fix it. Delete the indent and re-enter it, making sure you use consistent tabs or spaces but not both. 
They use a OOP paradigm like ECS, Entity, Component, System. It is an infinitely modular way of writing game code that allows multiple people, or multiple teams of people to write different parts of the code apart from each other without having to in now too much about what each team is doing. How to put the code together follows the ECS methodology and it's straight forward enough that very little explanation is necessary.

Check the previous line, you're probably missing a closing bracket or parenthesis.
Don't post the entire program. That's inane. We don't need to see the entire program (which might be 500 lines, or 500,000 lines) to fix a damn syntax error on *one line*. The syntax error traceback will point to either the line with the error, or the line immediately after the error in the case of missing parentheses or brackets.

Sure! &amp;#x200B; You might want to disable the automatic virtualenv creation by executing `poetry config settings.virtualenvs.create false` if you don't need it. &amp;#x200B; A basic Dockerfile could look like this: &amp;#x200B; FROM python:3.6.5 RUN curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdispater/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python - -y ENV PATH="/root/.poetry/bin:$PATH" RUN poetry config settings.virtualenvs.create false
I have no idea. I spent some time to write that too
That's strange since Poetry always operates in a virtualenv by default so it should not try to remove system packages. This is most likely a bug.
If you have C extensions using the Python C API, it's kind of supported, even though it's not documented yet, by using a `build.py` script and reference it in the `pyproject.toml` file.

I will give a look. Thanks
Great! Any constructive criticism will be appreciated!
I'll do
Thanks for the answer! I re-entered it multiple times but now it works.
Did you have much previous experience with Selenium? Looking to start a project here soon with Selenium being one of be potential options for implementation, and I've heard it has a bit of a tough initial learning curve? Also not that it matters, just curious if there was any particular reason you used Firefox driver rather then headless chrome? 
Ok. Later in home. Im in a train from Brussels Airport to amsterdam Airport because there's a workers strike in the airport of Brussels and my flight to Barcelona (where I live) were canceled and the airline just sent me a sms this morning (ryanair) i know it is offtopic XD but i needed to drain.

I also had a friend who kept calling me about general CS advice and eventually with his assignments. I do my best to help as I used to be a tutor and adjunct lecturer, but I've always noticed that the more you help students, the more they need help. It's like you help them cross the river but when the next river comes they are even more lost because they don't understand how they crossed the previous and it's a vicious cycle. I did my best to not do his assignment for him, but there comes a point where I just get frustrated and start telling him what to write, and that's when I just had to draw the line and stop helping him. I haven't spoken to him since, which just leads me to believe we were only friends so that I could help him with his work. Oh well, he wasn't a great friend anyway.
I was about to comment on `argparse` but then I saw OP's comment. IMHO, It's fine to keep different project that does the same thing. Just in case `argparse` gone rogue and starting to delete files and stuff.
Hey r/python, author here. If you've ever wanted to get into data analysis, this is my best attempt at getting you past that first hump. A lot of these concepts are easier than you might think.
Thanks a lot. We use pybind11, that uses cpython in the background. I would like to avoid compilation, because is a huge project that takes more than one hour compiling from the scratch, and the idea is to be more accessible. 
I know, just posting here because r/programming doesn’t allow text 
Great much appreciated
Yeah, after consulting with the devs, it seems like they believe that an incomplete enumeration of common substrings is 'expected' behavior and don't have any intention of making the small change required (even as an option) to produce the algorithmically correct answer. Their algorithm enumerates a few of the correct answers but their rule is to look for non-overlapping matches, not overlapping. A casual glance from difflib.py it seems like I should be able to create my own function similar to 'get_matching_blocks' that could include overlapping matches.
What do you mean by IDE? IDE - Integrated Development Environment. That is what Pycharm and Visual Studio are. Jupyter is for running ipython notebooks, which is a different way of doing things, which is not an IDE. Do you mean the python REPL? (Read, execute, print loop - aka running python and just typing it straight into the terminal) 
First, a decorator would be used for the interpreter to change the type of a function it is. So for example the static method one, means that the method, is independent of objects, and it itself is a method of class but not object. Should the two add functions have different names: Ideally yes, but this was more for demonstration purposes, so... If they are the same will they conflict: most likely no, ( I didn't run it through the interpreter. But the reason, For it not is because, this method is independent of object, and the other is a method that modifies or uses an object. (The word self tells you that) If they both used objects, then they will interfere right now, unless one had one more parameter, then function overloading takes over. Ie def func(a, b): print("{},{}".format(a,b)) def func(a,b,c): print("{},{},{}".format(a,b,c)) Where two functions can be used because the parameter length is different in this case, so the three parameter one will print three, and the two will print two.
This goes to show how much I know. Yes, the REPL. 
I have used it one other time prior for something work-related. Very easy to use and I didn’t find there to be a steep learning curve (for what I was wanting to achieve anyway). Project originally started out on a raspberry pi, so that is kinda what dictated use of Firefox in this instance. Funny enough, I used Chrome for the work project. Saw no real pros/cons over the other to be honest. Both “just work”.
cool idea, I modified it a bit to use a counter instead, and be faster by refreshing instead of closing/reopening the browser, sloppy but quicker [https://gist.github.com/haqthat/2b79742f082e0864ee522b2a1b447818](https://gist.github.com/haqthat/2b79742f082e0864ee522b2a1b447818)
Ok cool good to hear Thank you!
It returns a string of class variables. Each %s is replaced with a parameter that comes later. So the first %s is replaced with variable self.cached, second %s is replaced with seperator variable (probably the ":") etc.
for macos: - `brew cask install chromedriver` - `cp /usr/local/bin/chromedriver ./` Runs well! I wonder if this can be used to get some connection requests :P
I noped out of plumbum halfway through the first page of the documentation, so you're not alone
Thank you! I didn't realise that's what $s represented, it makes somewhat more sense now.
Nice! I didn't realize that.
&gt; Ever wished the compactness of shell scripts be put into a real programming language? Mnope.... If you need shell scripts and commands, just use shell scripts. I use python for a purpose, and I like my code to be longer but readable, not compact. I actually hate the compactness of bash scripts. I just don't get why would somebody want to use that library instead of `subproces` or `os.system`. It's basically the same thing. 
Nono, that's the point. Sending mass requests is bad. Viewing profile and waiting for people to respond back is wayy better. PS: would advice to refactor out the magic numbers 3.5, 6.9 into the config as well.
The best place to ask questions like this is over in /r/learnpython What you probably want is [list slicing](https://www.pythoncentral.io/how-to-slice-listsarrays-and-tuples-in-python/)
I mean there’s no way to stay in my current job. When I move back I will most likely take up some type of small job to stretch out my money and keep me from getting burnt out.

Well, this isn't a clone of argparse, it's a wrapper on argparse! If argparse goes rogue, I'm hosed. (i.e., I'd have to base it on something else)

Really awesome. The only things I'd add for a purely intro post is dropping duplicates and showing how to create a new data frame from a subset of the columns. 
I think this is a good format for people without any Python and Pandas background. One suggestion I have is to add an additional note or warning before the df[1:3] example to explain how Pandas indexes at row zero. You touch on it it with the "inclusive of both bounding row numbers" text but you may want to make it more obvious because that type of thing often trips up users who are coming in from an Excel background. 
If you're talking about what I think you're talking about, pipenv was inappropriately treating pip as a library. Now, if you want to discuss if pip should expose itself as library or not, that's a different matter (personally, I think it should expose a public Python api). However, at the end of the day, pypi.org is just a website that does expose an api for interacting with packages stored there. pip is just one tool to interact with it, and it's not even the first package manager for python (though, I feel like calling `easy_install` a package manager is doing it too many favors). pip doesn't handle publishing packages either, afaik setuptools is really the only tool for that (there's also twine, but that's a wrapper around setuptools to make it more ergonomic around the CLI). I suppose technically distutils also handles that, but again, afaik that's a dead project. Honestly, I'm not sure if you know what you're talking about or not.

If you feel the need to be condescending, you should at least abstain from doing so, when it's clear that *you* have no clue what I'm, saying. For the record: I have never claimed that pip does the packaging, but rather stated that I prefer a situation where environments, packaging and installation are three totally separate tasks. I have no doubt that you are in fact clueless about what I write. 
&gt; Also, there is a world of jobs that do not require JS (even for entry level). I don’t know it and hope I never need to. Jealous. I'm not a web developer, but I still need to whip up little web interfaces for internal use, sometimes. It's like one of my favorite podcasts says: You don't choose JavaScript, JavaScript chooses you.
I would suggest you don't just learn python. Also learn about git and open source projects. And try to contribute to some open source project so that will give you some real experience. You can also have a look in Frontend web development. I have seen people growing leaps in 6 month in this. Open source is must for you to learn fast and get ready to how software is really developed
!RemindMe 8 Dec, 2018 "Did /u/Jordan_From_Ga quit his job and learn python"
I would try to find out why some entries have 4 colons in them. That to_string method clearly only produces 2. Decide what the proper format is (probably not an easy task), then make all methods consistent with that format. While it will be messy, it's your code now. Spend enough time with it to ensure you won't break something, but don't be afraid to enforce consistency.
It is indeed a very brief introduction to the marvel Python's `Pandas` library. I absolutely adore it to the moon and back. It would be pleasant if you could elaborate and provide more detailed examples and workflows on it. I believe `Pandas` could literally be utilized for more than what it is catered for. I, once extracted Google Spreadsheets data using `Pandas`. It never fails to marvel me. 
The formatting in this post...
Fixed it :)

I migrated from pipenv to poetry after constant pipenv maintainers' toxicity on GitHub issues and I don't regret.
Thank you, that sounds like a great idea. I really appreciate the help! 
Thx
Different languages have different idioms. I don't think there is much merit in arguing about what is good or not good. You use the idioms of a given language because those patterns are idiomatic of the language. You should write your python code in such a way that a person who is only knowledgable of python would expect to see python written. You should write your Java in such a way that a person who only knows Java would expect to see Java written.

Best of luck to you! I recommend you join ##learn-python on Freenode IRC. Fantastic community to ask questions :)
Thank you so much! I literally was stumped on my homework till I scrolled past this!!!
hear hear! The convenience the library provides makes me grateful to its entire community (and the R community as well)
Personally, I have never had a use case where a getter/setter would be preferable to directly reading / setting attributes from the object bin question. I can see this being valuable for writing library code, but that's about it. For those who use the property decorator frequently, I'd be interested to hear where eare using it!
I'm not sure why you would use setters and getters. Why can't you just change the object-variables by accessing them with "object.variable = value", and access them with "object.variable". Can someone explain why it's a better practice to write setters and getters for the variables?
ill give that a try... thanks!

\*\*TODO:\*\* Train a language processing model off google scholar to edit my papers.
The reason is: in Java, getters / setters are the only way to provide some generic description about a class of objects (interfaces cannot have fields, so, if, say, your `ArrayList` had a field `length`, and your `LinkedList` also had a field `length`, there would be no way for you to write generic code that accounts for existence of this field). Java generics appeared historically much later and while they do solve some of these problems, they are, essentially, in contradiction with the original Java type system. To contrast this, in Python **all** fields of an object are, essentially, properties / can be thought of as being properties. Nothing stops you from writing generic code that assumes existence of a particular field in an object, so, the problem simply doesn't exist. However, historically again, Python suffered a lot of influence from Java. And, I say "suffered" because it was mostly bad influence. `@property` decorator appeared as part of that influence, its usefulness is really dubious. I think, it was added to demonstrate what decorators could do, but it got much more attention than one would have hoped for.
I use `sh` instead of `subprocess` in everyday life. The `subprocess` API is outright bad and all backwards. It makes me write too much repetitive code, and I don't see Python as a good language for writing the final version, it's only for prototyping. So, the sooner I can get the prototype done, the better.

Hi, I'm a beginner and I'm not sure on what' your asking. is this something like this will help? &amp;#x200B; for x in range(1,8): day = "Enter the number of donuts for day "+ str(x) numBugs = int(input(day)) # and so on Hope it helps a bit Regards
design patterns result from weaknesses of a language. that isn't a knock on java. it's inevitable for any language, but java is the German of programming languages. it's a very signed-in-triplicate, bureaucratically verbose language and has caused many design patterns encapsulation is a good thing. getters and setters are one way that can be accomplished. but sometimes you just don't care. sometimes it doesn't matter if you set a property directly. but requirements change. if you start out with public properties in java, if you realize you made a mistake, refactoring can be expensive because the syntax change is expensive so java has become overly defensive with just about everything, expecting POJOs for even the most basic data structures modern languages (ok, python is pretty old) have solved this with alternate syntactic sugar. `@property` is how python did it. it allows you to escalate the implementation without affecting the usage, so you can start out simple and apply changing requirements with minimal overhead. (to go on a tangent, the short-coming with this is that properties need a backing field. kotlin solved this by automatically creating backing properties) 
Why did you name it Poetry /u/SDisPater? Since it is "PYTHON PACKAGING AND DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT MADE EASY" maybe it should be called brickmason or ups or something like that?
Also, was the author of pip not willing to accept pull requests?
&gt;San You should see the flurry of work that has gone on since the end of the Summer since Sanic went to a community organization. Now there is a team of developers (myself included) that are working to polish this to being a more polished product. Coming up in December will be the first LTS release.
I think it depends on what you are trying to do. In terms of creating I command-line interfaces, I have settled on [Plumbum](https://plumbum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli.html#guide-cli) after much investigation. You stated that the library would "instill some really bad habits into newbie programmers" without being specific: what particular bad habits would it instill? &gt; laid out why I think this library would be worth avoiding What did you say? Why dont you discuss this with the author of Plumbum? &gt; I cut numpy and Pandas slack for their non-standard use of standard operators, Well, get ready to cut SQLAlchemy some slack too. Overloading operators to create a DSL is a very pythonic way of doing things. You seem to be trying to avoid the power and nature of Python in defense of some perceived subjective readability standard. &gt; Plumbum seems to use this command["args"] and obj = class["args"] style just because. Again, contact the author and see what motivated his decisions. I am very impressed with his/her [command-line generating support](https://plumbum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli.html#guide-cli).
it's called "encapsulation." it's how you protect your data and one way to enforce a single source of truth let's say you have some class: class Hodor: def __init__(self): self.url = '' now, you can set `url` directly anywhere: `hodor.url = 'http://goatse.cx'` that's great. everything works smoothly. such a simple syntax fast forward 20 years. you learn you need to support https and only https, but your code base is now 18-bajillion zettabytes with 69 bajillion references to the `url` property sometimes allowing http, https, and ftp if you don't have a setter, you have to change 69 bajillion lines of code if you have a setter, you have to change it once python allows you to start out without a getter/setter so the syntax is simple but provides the syntax to escalate simple properties to getters/setters without changing the usage
In Django I generally use @property so I can use a method without explicitly calling it 
If you copy the link of Google sheets and `read_csv`, paste the link and after the link type `export = 0`. My friend you would have your whole Google sheets in the form of an CSV.
Designed by developers, for developers... And anything else you can think of...
in your example, your setter isn't setting a value &gt;&gt;&gt; class Prop: ... @property ... def prop(self): ... return 42 ... @prop.setter ... def prop(self, value): ... print (f"Set prop to {value}") ... &gt;&gt;&gt; proptester = Prop() &gt;&gt;&gt; proptester.prop 42 &gt;&gt;&gt; proptester.prop = 117 Set prop to 117 &gt;&gt;&gt; proptester.prop 42 if you want to persist any data, it requires a property (by convention, one that begins with an underscore) 
could not figure out to manage multiple PyPIs in a single project... :(
Your wording imply that there must be a field inside the object for the property decorator to function. This example show the opposite. Btw, you may have though "persist", but you never wrote it before now. 
SOCKS sounds like something that should be *separate* from an application-level protocol. It's applicable exactly the same way to HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, or almost any other client-initiated TCP-based network protocol. 
Questions like this belong in /r/learnpython. 
&gt; Your wording imply that there must be a field inside the object for the property decorator to function. if you're using properties and setters in conjunction, they do, unless you're doing arbitrary garbage like in your example &gt; This example show the opposite. no, it demonstrates abusing language features to be pedantic &gt; Btw, you may have though "persist", but you never wrote it before now. I edited my comment, genius you're either a child or a troll. im not continuing this conversation
Command line arguments or interactive commands?
Thank you! Me too, that would be awesome. I read they're playing their last ever show next year in Colorado. Unfortunately it's too far away from me (I'm in the UK), but if by any chance you're closer it could be your chance!
Interactive commands.Argparse will do the job.Thanks for teplying.
My bad.Will have this in mind next time.
Argparse will do the job.This is what i was looking for!Thanks!
Whatever. You're clearly too full of yourself for me to care. 
If you use property syntax, callers are going to expect that if your setter returns without throwing an exception, calling the getter immediately afterward will return the value that was passed to the setter. I.e.: &gt;&gt;&gt; spam.prop 42 &gt;&gt;&gt; spam.prop = 47 &gt;&gt;&gt; spam.prop 47 Now there definitely are ways to maintain this "social contract" invariant without having a private field that directly backs the property, but you don't show any of them. Your example would be more compelling if you included enough code to show not just that it runs without a backing field, but how you might maintain the expected behavior of a property in that case.
&gt; There is a very important point that I haven't seen mentioned yet. In Python you can replace the url member with a property later. The existing client code will not need any changes: absolutely. that's what i intended by saying "escalate simple properties to getters/setters without changing the usage" i probably should've elaborated a bit thanks for your clarification 
Unicode makes things so unnecessarily difficult and I just don't understand why it's the default behavior. As an optional module sure, but it feels like what should be trivial data operations like the above turn into a fight over the languages preferred use.
I think the answer is just never to use the mess known as Python 3. FOr web development stuff like this matters, but for a simple scripting language for data operations it just adds unneeded complexity with literally no benefit.
And Java is 80% boilerplate. 
Also seems like poetry is faster.. pipenv is slow as a snail.

OP says he is working 80-90 hours per week. https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9s84xg/putting_it_all_on_the_line_for_python/e8mv7uc
In my experience analyzing binary data, you want to unpack it into a struct. https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html
If you are not going to show a GUI, why use PyQt5? Why not Python alone? Waiting for OS signal? mmm... smells fishy
If you feel like dealing with random UnicodeDecodeError at inconvenient times is fun, then I guess you have 14 months left to do so. And for the record, questions like this do really belong in /r/learnpython 
There is some stuff from Eric Raymond [here](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/practical-python-porting/) about porting from Python 2 to Python 3 that covers some utf 8 stuff. 
I wouldn't deal with these things because I'm not a web developer working with different locales. I'm trying to concatenate hex strings together.
Wow thanks the author clearly understands how annoying this makes certain data operations &gt; The Python 2 to 3 language transition is rough on code like this. The main problem is the change from Python 2 strings containing uninterpreted bytes to Python 3 strings containing Unicode code points. What was simple in Python 2 becomes trickier in 3; if you’re not careful when forward-porting to 3, you code may throw sporadic and difficult-to-track encoding errors on binary data that was innocuous in Python 2 - or, worse, it may silently corrupt that data. Fortunately, this is a solvable problem, and we’ll show you how. I just want my no-brainer byte strings back.
For the same reason why you might use the base Qt framework without a GUI: it has a lot of non-GUI utilities that make cross platform work easier. QThread for example. It’s possible the Python Standard Library doesn’t have what the OP’s looking for built in. Could be wrong anne a suspicious project, but just offering up another perspective. 
&gt; if you're using properties and setters in conjunction, they do, unless you're doing arbitrary garbage like in your example but they really don't. You need some kind of persistence, but it doesn't mean you need an attribute to do so. @property def x(self): with open('x.txt') as f: return f.read() @x.setter def x(self, value): with open('x.txt', 'w') as f: f.write(str(value)) which part of this code violates your assumption about relation between getters and setters? Getter/setter of "x" from the outside perspective, which is the only thing everybody cares about, is separate from the internal implementation details. Encapsulation and shit. 
You gotta give more information man
It's because you commented it out
What?
What did you expect it to do, and what did it actually do?
He goot post it in /r/learnpython and learn to [do it properly](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F).
Instagram had a very limited official api, which is not for private use. There is a private api, which emulates using an Android app, but it's outdated, unofficial, and you can get banned for using it. My suggestion? Don't bother. Instagram (and Facebook) just don't want you to automate things on their platform.
Everyone can get a free API.
I am looking forward to. 
Here are some tips: 1. Your use of range() is a little scary. 2. As someone else pointed out, you can easily use random.sample() or random.choice() to pick random items from lists. 3. Soooo much manual typing in your code 4. Too many commented out lines, it looks very messy and it's hard for an external person to make sense of your work. Best of luck in learning Python!
Convert the cidr mask to octal and you can just subtract them.

Hey, I like your extension, thanks for making it. What I'm looking for is basically inline evaluation (something like [this](https://atom.io/packages/hydrogen)) and the ability to send code from the editor to a running repl (like [this](https://youtu.be/GaXo7dx5XzY?t=239) in F# @ 3:58-ish).
&gt; I have no doubt that you are in fact clueless about what I write. You'd be right because I have no idea what point you're attempting to make. First you claim that vendoring is a problem with pypi, then there's no clear separation between pypi and pip, then pipenv broke because of pip update. I'm not trying to be condescending but you're not communicating your point about pypi, pip and vendoring. Now whether you're ignorant on the matter or there's something else hindering that, I don't know. So here's everything I think on the various issues. # Vendoring This is a fundamental issue with how Python handles imports. You get one version of a package to import, unlike say C# where different packages can depend on different versions packages. So if you need to ensure that you're dealing with a specific version you have two choices: * Declare a hard dependence on a specific and to hell with what the end user had installed. This is just being a bad guest in my opinion. * Vendor that library and import from your vendored location. This sucks because now there's potentially two versions of a library (though loaded from two different locations) but you're not inhibiting the end user (probably, if your expecting user inputs for the vendored lib, this could be a source of pain because the user might send you the wrong version). # pip Pip's not great, but it's not completely terrible either. There's lots of things it could do better (namely: dependency resolution, exposing a first class python api). But it's leaps and bounds better than what we used to have. And it's never given me the sort of headaches that npm has. # pypi The actual packaging api is pretty trash imo. But that's controlled by the python packaging authority and can only be changed through peps. But as far as apis go, it's documented well enough that other clients can be reliably implemented. # pipenv I've never personally used it as a tool, I prefer virtualenvwrapper and pip but I'm a curmudgeon and stuck in my ways. There's also something about getting off my lawn in there too. As for why it vendors pip, my only guess would be, why would you spend a bunch of time implementing its features and tooling - remember that pip has more features than just pip install - when 1. You can get that for free by just wrapping pip 2. The package is called pipenv and not pipish-env # Package Management This shit is complicated as all hell and I'm glad people smarter than I have stepped up to deal with it. I'll admit I've never used a perfect tool, but I've used a few bad ones (npm, easy_install) and few decent ones (pip, cargo, nuget). Sure, I have gripes with each of these but they're not completely terrible to use. Now, I don't know where your point lies but I'm curious to know. 
1. It's not necessary for any technical reason. 2. It's extra typing for no gain. 3. Usually, the most important thing when it comes to code style is conformity with your team and/or the larger community. Even if there was a good argument for using java-style getters/setters you should still not use them. It's the same idea behind trying to use spaces vs tabs for indents...you might have a good reason to use one or the other, but it doesn't override established team or community preferences.
"return the amount of perfect square numbers that are smaller or equal to n" is pretty simple, but I'm not getting what the assignment is asking you for. Can you screenshot or take a picture of the problem?
Ι have to complete the '____________' so the count_squares function will work
Yeah that's what I mean, not sure what it's asking for. Most of what you posted seems unnecessary, so I think we're missing something. For instance, here's a simple function to do what you want, but it doesn't use "is_square = _____" so we'd have to know exactly what the problem is to help you: def count_squares(n): i, squares = 1, 0 while i &lt;= n: if i * i &lt;= n: squares += 1 i += 1 return squares print(count_squares(10))
My team has switched all our python projects which were using `pipenv` to `poetry`. The biggest factors for my team to make this decision were. 1. `pipenv` kept updating packages by major/minor versions unexpectedly when doing `pipenv install`. For library development `poetry` replaces need for `setup.py` file. 2. `poetry` replaces need for `setup.py` when developing library packages for `pypi` or our own private `pypi`. A more squishy reason I personally prefer `poetry` is that issues and PRs seem to be discussed with a decent level civility, and thoughtful discussion. I have seen sdisapater change his mind on things if someone can present a compelling reason. There have been bugs, `poetry` is still very young. Getting better every week though.

Haha okay, good luck on your assignment bud.
&gt; why is not good to use the pattern used in Java in python? The real question you should ask is "Why does Java encourage a getter pattern?" The answer, to my knowledge, is because it allows the Java programmer to add "constraints" to the property at a later date, _without_ changing the object's interface. Without using getters/setters from the start, you'd force users of the library to switch from `foo.bar` to `foo.getBar()` if you needed to add some (mild) logic to how `bar` is returned. In python, that's not a problem - the developer can use `@property` syntax to add constraints to the property later, without forcing the callers to change how they use the object.
Your tests shouldn't be hitting a db. This is a fundamental flaw in your tests. The goal is to test *your* code, not your db lib or sql. These are already tested elsewhere. Mock your db calls, assert they recv the args they should, and have your mock return test data. Your tests will be faster, safer, and more maintainable.

Something about the font on this website makes it fairly unpleasant to read. It seems like it's stretched out vertically.
There is never a good solution for this in any software system. It's one of the big problems in testing. The best solution is to mock out the database entirely, so that your tests run against some stored data / simple stub code that pretends to be the database. That's hard to do. If you can't do that, next best thing is to have a real database with the schema installed and a small test set of data preloaded. Use transactions to roll back database changes between tests if you have to. Most databases support some sort of "in memory" database that's much faster than going to disk; at least Postgres, MySQL, and SQLLite all do.

This. Tdd is specifically terrible for database and gui.
In Java, there are two reasons for getters and setters. First, it provides a stable API in case the implementation changes. In Python, if you need to remove/change a field, you can use properties to maintain the API. The other reason for getters and setters in Java is access control. By now, we (as a programmer community) have realized that language-enforced access control is a fool's errand much better implemented with simple conventions since "we're all consenting adults here".
One good use case for a better is making a computed value that gets computed when it's used. Setter for when you want to make shorthand for a more complex process behind the scenes. But never for controlling what a developer can and can't do.

On my current project we don't do much unit testing and rather write mostly integration tests that test the system as a whole, as a regular client of it. Each test creates all of the data it needs from scratch (other than a very few items that are expected to always exist in the system). We don't clean up any data between tests. We just create a new empty DB (automatically) before the suite runs. Extensive mocking is pretty tedious and confusing; I'm liking this approach much better. 
As of when? Just set up some new environments last Thursday...
Would they release a future 3.* Version that is backwards compatible with 2.7?
I wouldn't say this is a critical vulnerability, it takes the owner of the original endpoint to redirect to a non-https endpoint. Something they'd hopefully not do! Still a good idea to upgrade :)
agreed. Also seems like it makes testing pretty hard.
I got the GitHub notification this morning.
LPT always in the comments!!
Same here! 
What would need to be in place to consider adding a speech_input builtin to python for the purposes of conversational audio interfaces?
Do not do this, your SQL code is still your code
&gt; Would they release a future 3.* Version that is backwards compatible with 2.7? No. The Python foundation will stop support for Python 2.7 on 1st January 2020 and they have not been doing any serious feature support for quite some time. Guido has talked about the pains of the transition many times, here's a good video on what he thinks were the successes and failures: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiw23yfqQy8 Making a version of Python that is compatible with Python 2 and 3 would be a mess, and this point the community is now firmly on the Python 3 bandwagon and many popular projects are in various stages of dropping Python 2 support. 
Depends on the db and if you're using an ORM. In some cases you'll be able to get a long way with an in memory sqlite database
No, the python community is not motivated to do so. Guido has his own way of stating that 'The factors affecting the design were backwards compatibility, avoiding ambiguity, the desire for equivalence, and evolution of the language.' From "What's new in Python 3.0" (available here): Python 3.0, compared to 2.6. Python 3.0, also known as “Python 3000” or “Py3K”, is the first ever intentionally backwards incompatible Python release. There are more changes than in a typical release, and more that are important for all Python users. Nevertheless, after digesting the changes, you’ll find that Python really hasn’t changed all that much – by and large, we’re mostly fixing well-known annoyances and warts, and removing a lot of old cruft.
Whoa weird, commenting so I remember to check this out later
Corey Schafer released a short Django tutorial on YouTube recently that’s a good supplement to the docs tutorial. Check it out if the docs leave any holes in your knowledge.
Hey lex, I have 2 questions to be addressed. 1. Would be great if you could ask him about what he thinks the future of python would be? 2. What are his thoughts upon packaging and distributing python code? How can the core developers and open source communities contribute towards improving the current implementation.?
There is a safe feature on Reddit.
That's fine, I forget to check my saved but dont forget to check my comments.
 class Thing: def __init__(self, somename): self.name = somename self.status = "Initial Status 0" @property def status(self): return self.__status @status.setter(self, value) def status(self, value): # some code to store the current name and status in a database # ...or to update a static web page someone might use to check on the status # ...or to perform some other status update action self.__status = value &amp;#x200B;
What he thinks of functional programming in python ? Will python be updates to support monads ? 
So you can see the down votes? 
What are some things he wish the community had different points of view on or get more focused about?
I guess so in this case.
What will his role be in Python for the future, both near and far? As we all know, he stepped down as BDFL and is taking a permanent vacation, and different governance models are being discussed in the meantime, however, as some on /r/Python and /r/programming noticed, he still has been executing BDFL-like authority-- most notably in regard to the controversy regardinging the master/slave renaming. Will he continue to excersise BDFL-like authority, and if so, what is the point in stepping down?
Packaging: Show him [XKCD #1987](https://www.xkcd.com/1987/) and get comments; also be good if you could bring up the just-released packaging system called [Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/).
To get a job in the computer industry you need to have three things 1) The technical skills. A formal degree is by no means necessary to get these. You can get them from bootcamps or free online courses if you are especially self-disciplined to use them every day. 2) A professional network. Most jobs come from people you know. Going to school can give you the opportunity to meet and work with other students, and interact with students in clubs. Get to know the upper clansmen. That way when you graduate you have friends already working. If you dont go the school route, meetups can be a good way to meet others in a industry. Meetup.com is a great place to start. You won't find anyone who will give you a job right away, but can give you a wide network of people who would recommend you to their boss 6 months later. 3) Proof of your technical skills and ability to be a good coworker. A degree does this a little, but what employers really like to see is projects-- especially ones you collaborate on. If you do school projects, document them. Let yourself explore and have fun tinkering on different projects you find interesting, this will serve as a flag to interviewers about the kinds of things you like working on. But also make sure you have the discipline to finish some of them. Gambling everything on an all or nothing 6 week binge could work. But I wouldn't recommend it. I would recommend, if possible, a slow 1-2 year burn meeting people and hacking on projects. That way if you make a mistake your whole plan to freedom isn't screwed. Best of luck friend. 
I thought the Github notification was very nice, it's an interesting approach to pushing devs to do security. Though the conda respository is still on 2.19.1 as of writing so my code at work can't be updated yet as that's our primary respository: https://anaconda.org/anaconda/requests
Does Guido think asyncio is evolving well or does he wish it had gone differently (e.g. adding the async keyword sooner)? Is it a good enough concurrency model to compete with Go or is something more fundamental to the runtime necessary?
This has been asked and answered many times. 
What is his opinion on the different library installers: conda, anaconda, pip, yum, apt, brew? 
Is Python 4 coming, and what kind of changes or new features we could expect from it.
I would be very interested in a detailed analysis by Guido of what he thinks about the language design choices and philosophy of design of the Julia language. What are the pros, cons, and pitfalls he sees. I'm not sure he's been following it much though.
GvR has always been very bearish on functional programming. It's why the functional tools in Python 2 at least are so limited. It's why lambdas gimped and single expressions only. Python is shot through with places where learning from functional languages would be valuable, but doesn't, or does so in a limited fashion. I'd love to get a modern, definitive view on this question, but the historical precedent is pretty clear and there are perhaps more worthwhile questions in what's probably going to already be a busy interview.
Wouldn’t you at least need date and/or datetime fields for when users pick up items and drop them off? Seeing as the project doesn’t authentication, the item quantities are infinite, and there is a reluctance to use Google Forms, it smells like school work to me. 
Inline evaluation is def much harder in VSCode, I'm exploring some options to implement it, but frankly I doubt it will happen with current APIs. &amp;#x200B; The second request is much more doable and something I'd be happy to implement. I'm curious at what the use case for it what would be though? Seems very similar to just executing a line of code? What are the benefits of doing it the way as done in the video?
 - Why does Guido hate `reduce` and `fold`? - Will Python acquire any other functional features? (currying, ...)
That's precisely not the question I want answered. For example getting audio collected on the device and processed in the cloud to yield text has very little to do with a gui.
Well, I’ll save you the suspense. The answer is no, that’s not the kind of thing they add core packages for anymore. They hate adding new core packages, and “batteries included” aside, they won’t add something like recording device audio when they can let you install a package to do it. 
I have a question: Are there any features from PROLOG that you would like to see added to Python? Logic programming is the one paradigm that doesn't get as much love as I think it deserves in Pythonland
Why do you assume device audio recording in python is necessary for speech input on emerging platforms for which python is a relevant programming language? 
Transition from Python 2 to Python 3 took years. What is being done to ease transition to the next major version like Python4?
What's with all the malicious libraries on PIP, why can't it just be like the App Store?
Agreed. It's a fundamental function of the business I work for. Easy to secure, easy to deploy, and rock solid.
There have been malicious apps in the App Store before dude.
When will he excise the GIL?
You might want to clarify what exactly you want. Do you want a pre-trained model to go from .wav to text? Device to .wav? Device to text? Once you clarify that, don't send it to von Rossum, because he doesn't care anymore^(\*). That's a question for python-dev. You'll probably want to wait for the outcome of [PEP-8000](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8000/) &amp; [\-8001](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8001/) to know exactly what to do with it, though. &amp;#x200B; \* That's a lie. He probably cares a lot. He's just retired from that role.
I used to think there weren't any stupid questions in programming. Then I read this.
That's a neat idea. I think I'll go with that.
I second asking about poetry. 
This was really good. Thanks for sharing this.
So something like: `&gt;&gt;&gt; a = oct(12)` `'0o14'` `&gt;&gt;&gt; b = oct(16)` `'0o20'` `&gt;&gt;&gt; int(b,8) - int(a,8)` `4` &amp;#x200B; I'm not quite understanding the result and how I translate that. I assume I misunderstand your statement. Can you clarify?
Python is an unique language when it comes to using it. Using Python is pleasant with pretty much no side effects or tradeoffs. IMHO, there's no Linux distribution or BSD flavor that would be "the Python of operating systems" for the end user. Ubuntu claimed to be, but those were only claims. Since Guido was spot on with the language, perhaps you could ask him about his perspective: when will we get the Python of operating systems and what could it borrow from Python?
There's no way the Python Software Foundation has enough resources to review every package submitted to PyPI, if that's what you're suggesting. Even if they're community-reviewed, you'd have to prepare for long wait times between updates, and people would just go back to installing things from GitHub, which isn't better.
If you could rewrite python from scratch, would you still have made a distinction between statements and expressions (which seems to be part of the reason a special assignment operator was needed)? [A lot of newer languages only have expressions, in the tradition of lisp] Thanks for the language and hard work improving it, btw. It is a real pleasure to use most of the time.
this is the python programming language subreddit not the making bank one
The sustained downvotes suggest perhaps I'm not as clear as I thought I was. I really wanted to avoid a leading question because in the course of learning about the design of python I'm often surprised. Unlike people in this thread I'm not that interested in anticipating Guidos answer. I had envisioned an interface where a novice programmer could write their first program using speech_input rather than input to get a string, where language and audio processing is handled by the underlying platform, although I was a little interested in whether a viable python stdlib implementation would have been a necessary requirement for inclusion. 
LOL at this point majority moved on to Python 3, there's no incentive to support those lagging behind. Guido himself had part migrating large code base (DropBox code) to Python 3. Seems like the way to do it is: 1. automatic converters/pylint --py3k/etc + six 2. mypy (running in Python 2 and Python 3 mode) 3. test cases
I have updated the code in my blog. Thanks for your suggestions. [https://gist.github.com/dineshsonachalam/b4261928382d3a288236adc5344ff071](https://gist.github.com/dineshsonachalam/b4261928382d3a288236adc5344ff071)
its too fragmented IMO. 
In Common Lisp, in CLOSS there isn't a built-in way to have virtual slots (something that would serve the same function you describe, i.e. not have actual storage, but answer to all the same API of slots). Quite foolishly, I once undertook it upon myself to implement one. And then I fixed it. And then I fixed it again. And then I fixed it again. And I kept fixing it until I threw away the code doing it. It wasn't really worth the trouble. In python `@property` doesn't really behave like a field. It does so only in some cases. Having bad experience with this kind of obfuscation from CL, I quickly discovered that in Python the problem is just as real as it is in CL. Finally, I don't think that "fixing" API by replacing field with a `@property` is a good thing. I can understand how sometimes it can save you some work, but to me, this seems like a ghetto thing to do. A kind of half-solution, a band-aid. If it needs to be a method, then just make it a method.
del data[delete]
what is this data[i] ? what is i ?
haha i thought it would have been something so simple... thanks heaps!
i meant integer but all good, it is solved :)
Yeah, this is a sure way to increase entropy of your code. It is not a solution to the problem, it is a way to avoid solving it for a time being. If you wanted a real solution, you would've replaced it with a method and changed all those places where it is used as a property. Else, you let your code rot. With this strategy, after 20 years, your code will be in such a terrible condition that you won't care anymore, you'd start writing new version regardless of cost.

It pains me to see functional programming in python be so clunky. Not having multi expression anonymous functions is such a drawback imo.
I'd love to know if they consider changing their opinion on using type hints for performance benefits if it all possible. Not make type hints compulsory, but use them when available for performance benefits. I know PyPy said they aren't making use of it, but may in the future. I already use it for a lot of use cases since PyPy is great for many of my use cases and type hints would make the JIT optimisations faster to produce and maybe even overall better. 
Sure, that's probably fair. It's true, there are very few legitimate reasons to use properties you're likely to come across; however, they can on occasion greatly simplify an API and make it very elegant. For example, I've hand written a pure-python protobuf parser. It's mostly for fun (though it's come in handy a couple times) and it interprets raw bytes blobs as protobuf messages, fields, and values without any associated schema. For each wire type in a protobuf, there are several different interpretations that a representation might have. An 8-byte fixed length field could be a signed int, or a double precision float. Or unsigned! A variable length bytes blob might be UTF-8 text, or just raw bytes, or it might be parseable as a nested message. Varint fields might store their sign in the least significant bit. All of these interpretations are ways to *view* the data. I might only care about getting and setting a field's value as a sint64, so I've written all these views as property descriptors that get and set a single inner representation. The corresponding value through all the other view attributes naturally will also change in sync with that. I would argue that this is an extremely good situation to apply properties: I'm getting and setting the value in a way that desires transformation, and I don't have to write "n = f.get_sint64()" and "f.set_sint64(-5)"; the getting and setting semantic is obvious and natural. Nor do I ever have to write lots of extra logic to store a big variant of all the kinds of interpretations i might have stored: it's always the same code path every time. --- On the other hand, using properties to do things like get the length of a list and truncate it (and pretend to be JavaScript while you're at it I suppose) is bad. So is the kind of reflection that will lead you to problems with descriptors not looking The Same as normal attributes, I strongly believe. If you're trying to auto-serialize objects through their __dict__ or some garbage like that you're in for all kinds of trouble. Use the tools as they were designed to be used! Properties are fine when used correctly, and so are __slots__ and ABCs and all manner of weird things.
This is pretty cool. Nice find. Note that Python is intentionally mostly imperative, except for comprehensions, map and a hidden reduce function (tucked away in `functools`). See: http://python-history.blogspot.com/2009/04/origins-of-pythons-functional-features.html?m=1 http://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2009/04/tail-recursion-elimination.html?m=1 https://fold.sigusr2.net/2010/03/guido-on-functional.html (referring to Masterminds of Programming)
Convert CIDR to range of integer numbers (start, end), then divide it into smaller ranges by making "holes" calculated from ranges you'd like to remove. You should end up with a set of (start, end) ranges, that can be converted back to IP addresses. 
Float\* not decimal. ;)
u/UltraMarathonMan I get it, your podcast has a linear perspective towards Intelligence and AI. Also most of the applications of deep learning and ML are implemented on the foundation of python and it's usecases and there is a lot to talk about in this scope. I am looking forward to listen to all the interesting topics that you are going to bring up. After all Guido is a humble and a nimble person. But packaging has always been a challenge in python ecosystem. As most of the people in the thread agree. It would be great if you could spare a few minutes to talk about that. Thanks.
Thank you for the reply, I'll have to look into exact what Matlab is doing to replace the data within the group. Probably the same thing I've been doing in Python.
Does he agrees that the biggest mistake in IT in the last decade is making Python3 not backwards compatible with Python2. I maintained a 2+Million LOC 2.x python program and it made my life a living hell. 
I guess you may read http://python-history.blogspot.com before talking python.
Well that's an oddly silo-specific overview of a _general purpose_ programming language, four of the five tasks it's used for being only tangentially related to back-end programming. Also not sure how the heck Jupyter makes it into any list immediately beside Flask and Django, but hey I'm sure there's a connection.
Funny how people will downvote you but a comment saying 'This.' will have 1000 upvotes on another thread.
That's very interesting, so basically each test acts on its own set of records that he explicitly created? since you're not cleaning -up, aren't there cases where tests step on its other toes? 
That's why if you want to build a calculator (or similar) with python, you better use a library that uses decimal numbers in the backend, like: https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/fractions.html
I'm familiar with HN, I probably miss the fatures that can help me, can you clarify?
That infographic is kind of poor. Not much info there and graphic is decorational only. I would call it a minimalistic leaflet. No offence. 
This goes against any testing strategy/pyramid that I read about (went through 20 in the last month). Tests must also include some sort of integration testing that resembles the real production scnenario. This is not about testing the DB lib rather testing you own DAL
Link is down?
Sorry completely missed you're reply, they lead on from one another. You need to know how to handle the data to build stuff with the data, you need to understand the more simple stats to learn the more complex stats (deep learning). The other things you can learn at your leisure, a framework is probably the first and last thing you need to consider. Ie, it's useful to be able to make what you build look cool but equally it doesn't help you achieve the end goal. 
This is **NOT** the proper way to deploy Flask. [See the documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/deploy/). &gt; When running publicly rather than in development, you should not use the built-in development server (`flask run`). The development server is provided by Werkzeug for convenience, but is not designed to be particularly efficient, stable, or secure. &gt; &gt; Instead, use a production WSGI server
At my normal rate you've just asked for 7 minutes of my time with no clear explanation of what it is you want to accomplish. It would take me more than 7 minutes just to tease out of you a full understanding of what you need to accomplish. So, do that work for whomever takes on this task: describe exactly what the source data format looks like, what the target data format looks like, where these two files will be in relation to each other on the file system, and precisely what transformation needs to occur. For instance do either of those numerical fields every appear more than once in either file? Are there an exactly equal number of records in each file and you need merely to modify the target file to have the same sequence as the source? Is it possible that the number in the source could collide with any number in the target? Basically write up a job spec that will make it patently clear that what you want done can be written in &lt;7 minutes.
Are there any books he would recommend? Fiction or nonfiction, either is fine. 
The downvotes are not because you are unclear. People here are perfectly capable of understanding what you are saying. There just isn't any need for it in a programming language. Use third party tools and libraries. No, you can't have a pony.
Agreed, the github notification was a very good thing.
Pretty old project, not sure if it still working; In addition, it is a Django web application for downloading and converting mp3 from youtube.

with the clarifications further down in the thread, "ai" context of the interview and pythons "batteries included" motto, i think this is an excellent question. my initial love for python came from the power to do _anything_ i wanted in a clean, readable language. there was always a module (see "import antigravity"). that being said, i currently would not have use for speech input in what i do at the moment, but i think it would be one of those "wow, it's that easy" things python often has in store for its users. probably should live as a 3rd party/contrib for a while or forever though... but that as well as implementation aspects is part of the question GvR could address.

Hi, I'm not sure what you are actually searching. are talking about object/person tracking in a video ? if yes, I recommend you this Website: [https://www.pyimagesearch.com/](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/) [https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/07/30/opencv-object-tracking/?\_\_s=nnad6pfcoppfmajk4aat](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/07/30/opencv-object-tracking/?__s=nnad6pfcoppfmajk4aat) The wonderful person "behind" it is M. Adrian Rosebrock. He's really amazing and very helpful. He already wrote 2 excellent books. Hope it helps a bit Regards
Realize that there's a couple different projects here. 1. There are the people writing the engine or simply extending an existing engine... check out ID Tech 4 or the unreal engine. "How smoothly does the game play on pc/console" 2. There are the people who are writing the code that drives all the models.... why do ducks run away but crocodiles attack, how many hit points does a thing have, can you light something on fire, can you break something, can you pick something up, how much inventory do you have, can you ride something, etc. "how does the game play" this group of people also include the ones making the various levels or if it's an open environment defining the boundaries, etc. 3. Then there are the model artists creating the content who work with groups 1 and 2 and work with the creative director how has an idea for what the overall aesthetic of the game. "Hiw does an object look rendered and does if fit with the game" Obviously those divisions are arbitrary and all this groups have milestones to meet and points along the development cycle where everybody gets together and makes sure that it's all coming together. Along with that is lots of automated and good old play testing to verify that there are funny stupid bugs...
Why didn't he put a switch statement like most programming languages?
Then maybe it would be good to ask why there have been breaking changes between different versions of python 3. Seems to be using the opposite system most people use when versioning software. 
Now that he's no longer a BDFL, does he worry that the language moving forward may abandon some of the tenets that he instituted in it (no tail call optimisation, deprecating functional programming, his introduction of assignment expressions etc.)?
No sound cloud?:(
thank you!
That's nicely presented. I'm curious about how you get this colored output for you dataframes?
Given the rise of data science the ways Python has grown alongside it, how should Python maintain its position as the top one or two languages in the space? Does he see a way for Python to partner with or build in Julia?

Same package management, yes. I inherited a project and while pip installing stuff is easy if you get the wrong version which isn’t compatible with something else and the requirements.txt file isn’t well maintained you’re simply fucked. Tons of errors and good luck sorting them out on your own. 
&gt; About 12 years ago, Python acquired lambda, reduce(), filter() and map(), courtesy of (I believe) a Lisp hacker who missed them and submitted working patches. But, despite of the PR value, I think these features should be cut from Python 3000. Sounds like [he despised those functions back in 2005](https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=98196). Functional programming could have received more love in Python (Talking as an experienced Python developer who recently started learning Haskell).
Which if you're unit testing, you test separately.
What a waste of time
because it is trendy to reinvent the wheel on their Crapple Macbook,being dressed like faggots in without any form of corporate erhics. Security being the last of their worries.
I'll counter: why is dressing fashionably considered mandatory? In the tech industry, questioning appearance and social conventions is a strong cultural value. Part of that is due to the nature of the job: software quality is rarely correlated with UI aesthetics, things are very often not what they look like, and looking behind the scenes and figuring out what *actually* happens is kind of what our job is all about. This breeds a mentality that many of us apply to other areas of life - you'll often see tech people make choices on the extreme end of "pragmatic" in other life situations as well. Software dev, especially in high-innovation environments like a Valley startup, also requires a mentality of thinking outside the box; questioning habits and customs is a crucial ingredient to this. Almost all recent game changers started when someone asked "but is that really so?" And just like that, we question or outright reject other social conventions and habits as well, including the social imperative to dress fashionably. The other part is that, as programmers, we are interested in fellow minds much more than their physical appearance, and we'd rather spend an hour with someone who looks butt-ugly and smells kind of atrocious but has some insanely interesting insights to share, than with someone who has great looks but the intellect of an average-sized cucumber. But if you're constantly in an environment where nobody gives a rat's about what you look like, then there isn't really a reason to think about appearance much, so many people simply won't. And as far as I am concerned, that's totally fine. Although I do appreciate it when the people I share a room with take showers.
Yes well you never said you were doing integration testing, and the "default" type of testing is unit, which should never hit db or any other IO. You can google for strategies around integration and end to end testing with DB. Really it's just easier to have a full dev env that you don't care about and some setup / tear down scripts.
Unit testing is a waste of time? wat?
Contorting your tests with mocks if your SUT hits the db
That's what I heard, apparently Atom is much more friendly to extension developers. Well, when I program I want to minimise the time spent switching between the terminal and the editor itself - but at the same time I want to change a function, load and run it in the repl to debug and play around with it (within the context of the loaded project, of course). So, it's a hassle for me to highlight the function and then manually copy it, switch to the terminal, then paste the function and debug, then manually switch back to the editor and rinse and repeat. Hotkeys for executing the current line, current function, etc. in a repl would be great (without switching focus to the repl), switching back and forth between editor and repl as well (although I believe I can do that within VSCode itself? Maybe.). It may seem like a minor thing but I find it quite annoying because I need to do that all the time, hence why inline eval is so useful. Does that make sense?

I literally just found out yesterday he disapprove of `map()`. While I know he pointed out the alternative (list comprehension/generators) I think it still has its place for simpler implementations, keep the code short and neat.
I feel like the biggest issue with this code would be guaranteeing that the item your program finds is THE item. You mention a particular percentage off, which could be your first test. But, once you find the items that are supremely discounted, you will need a true false to determine whether that product is out of place. That is where my biggest issue is, you won't know if it's in the correct department unless you try to search the product name and gather it's criteria department. 
Good ol corporate 'governance' :). I have similar issues at work, issue is when I request a new package I can almost guarantee nobody qualified to really analyze the risk looks at it....
I forgot to mention,they will give a clue on which category to search in. Also, they will provide the name of an item. Yeah I could search by percentage as well as the price. Where do I start to build the python program?
As author I can tell you. That project now is not good. This app saving music on server. 
I'm thinking you're gonna need an API with the site and have your program request a page sorted by "most discounted" or however it may be called. I'm sorry, I'm not too well versed in this, so maybe someone could piggy back my process here. 
I think sorting it by "most discounted" will be too easy. I doubt it will be that easy to find the item. They did say it is "hidden". How about by name?
Invest in a high risk isa or pension fund
!RemindMe 2 days
What does it mean by hidden? And by name... Are you suggesting taking a context of all products in each department and finding outliers? That may take too long for a program to figure out, I'm sure there's millions of products on the site
This is definitely not the right subreddit for this. Regardless, you probably want to get a much stronger base understanding before tackling stuff like this.
They will give a clue on which category it will be under. The name of the item name and description will change according to the category it's in. Only the picture that remains the same. 
Look into scapy but don't go being a jerk and trying to actually DoS anything with a syn flood. 
There are types of attacks that benefit from forging the sender IP (see for example [here](https://www.cloudbric.com/blog/2015/03/reflection-attacks-and-amplification-atttacks/)), but a syn flood would not be one of them. The idea of a syn flood is that you try to occupy all of the victim's ports by opening connections and not letting the victim close them. If you were to spoof an address in the syn request then when the victim sent a syn-ack to the return IP it would get a reset in response and know it was OK to close that connection. As for how to do it in Python, I haven't tried but [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27448905/send-packet-and-change-its-source-ip) is a SO question where an answer suggests using the `scapy` package you can do so. The same basic approach is shown on a different SE site [here](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/64313/spoofing-public-ipv4-address)
Ahh okay. That's important information haha. So basically, the only way to identify the product would be through it's image, if I'm not mistaken?
Ah yes. Sorry forgot to mention.
thanks owner, please update me if there'll be a new project similar for that app :D
You are probably just overthinking it. Being in the right category or not does not matter as long as the discount is high enough. 
Then your only real option seems to be a reverse image search, and comparing keywords from the search to the item from this website. The issue with that is, once again, you can't really narrow it down, so you'll have to run the program to sift through millions of searches. I'm not too sure of any other way to validate the item without human interaction.
Python packaging is messy but I'm not sure the problem you describe is a symptom of that. It sounds like a regular problem you face in any project: choosing versions for all your deps that don't conflict with one another. Same thing with "dll hell" in shared libraries.
Stop spamming udemy. 
Without having seen the site, I can only assume it's like Amazon. Many vendors on there list prices differently so that they appear to be severely discounted. Maybe that's why I'm looking for a secure validation method.
I use them commonly in 3 scenarios: 1. if the type and/or the value really matters for some reason, the setter can validate the value before setting it (e.g. must be a particular custom type or must be an integer in a certain range to "make sense", for example a percentage attribute `0 &lt;= value &lt;= 100` or raise a ValueError) 2. read-only properties 3. lazy properties
Biggest mistake in IT in the last decade? You're joking right?
No and no.
You know a bigger one? 
https://github.com/ShySec/pingfs Virtual storage on ICMP packets. I know there are other 'whacky' file systems like that (pi fs for example, storing data using position in the PI constant), but I don't know if they are in Python.

Threw it into a pastebin if ghostbin was not working, here ya go [https://pastebin.com/M8DcFNJa](https://pastebin.com/M8DcFNJa) I'll look into the javascript, I also thought about using old.reddit so its no longer infinite scrolling but really wanted to learn to scrape infinite scrolling for other sites as well
It is because of the difference in the Number Systems. What maty be round in one system may not be on the other. Think of a 3 digit Number System. It has only the 3 digits 0,1 and 2. 1/3 in that system is simply 0.1. But on the Decimal system it is 0.333333333333333333333333... That is the reason this happens. Computers can have full precision only on numbers that can be represented on the binary system.
Which dynamic DNS service have gone commercial? I have been using https://freedns.afraid.org/ and it has been free quite a long time.
You at least understand that it's on OS level concept, not a GUI concept. The python DB-API or WSGI is the kind of thing I'm trying to get at, as IMO the specific question of speech input is likely to become almost universal on popular operating systems in the coming decades.
Remove the window.scrollto (comment it out) See what happens 
Dunno, good'ol smoke signals might be more "cloudy" as a transmission and temporary storage medium
What? Another packaging system to learn? But I just wrapped my head around `pipenv`. What does poetry offer? I hadn't heard of it until today.
There is a reason it is free. In most normal situations afraid.org is not an acceptable DNS service.
Me too. I used to use map/filter a lot, but I use list/dict/set/generator comprehensions exclusively now.
It goes down to what i assume is the "first page" and scrapes all image links. How would i make it go further? Also could you tell me why it throws that error with the scrollto in there
look into a monte carlo simulation using a stochastic model
How?
Hey! I found that and downloaded on pypi a couple days ago, thanks for making it!
Can you elaborate? I don’t use it any more but am curious
Because you're scrolling to the end of the page first without loading new elements and then trying to scrape 
What a weird coincidence that everyone wears a T-shirt and jeans (! Aka uncomfortable workmen’s pants) instead of kimono, sari, tunics, gi, kilt…
thank you
If you use their free product, you open up your domain to other folks to register sub domains. So while you might setup a record for “www.yourdomain.com” someone else without your permission can setup a record for “malwarehost.yourdomain.com” Not ideal.
I agree if the environment has two groups of people, developers and non-developers.... and they never mix.
Now seems to work. Was getting time out errors, during last hours.

Start around ~23 to 27:30. 'Encourage things people do well and share examples.' Integration testing is easy, unit testing is hard.

I had the same reaction 2 years ago, this use AWS API to change the Dns record https://github.com/fbouliane/ddns-updater-aws
I have this same question, commenting to be updated later. Thanks mate! 
Hiding side effects in what looks like simple attribute access is a great way to make your code difficult to reason about. That's the real reason why properties are a bad idea. 
It supports building and publishing too and resolves dependency issues somewhat differently.
I take it you don't write prod code of any consequence then.
at a quick glance, poetry looks similar to [bazel](https://bazel.build/).
You are running windows? How did you install matplotlib? 
That makes 3 of us.
My domain registrar has free dynamic dns, so I've never had to pay for another service.
I got a very simple question: with all the supoort microsoft is giving to python lately, do you think python alone will ever compete with java or c++ for desktop applications (although maybe using pyside, qt and stuff like that)?

Is asyncio actually considered concurrency? As far as I know it only helps with blocking I/O instead of running on multiple cores.

It's posted there as well but no one replies to post there, hence why its posted to both. I get you dont want this sub reddit filled with questions but its the only place to get questions answered.
Which registrar?
Interesting, but your predictions won't be very reliable using this simple approach. Still, an interesting way to show students how to start out. The frac variables should be calculated using natural logs. For example, frachigh should be ln(hi/open). You have extreme directional bias using discrete differences divided by a base.
&gt;What's wrong with Cobol dwindling userbase to start with, making finding candidates difficult. &gt;Oh I get it, you don't know anything about this world. Sure, no problem. Bye. But clearly you're just a grumpy bitter old man. Don't you have some kids to beat off your lawn? I hope I never have to work with someone bitter like you. 
Apart from adding the async keywords, have there been any other breaking changes? 
You could try antigravity. https://xkcd.com/353/
I'd suggest Python because beside being simpler language, it allows you to learn things unrelated to language faster and that's really handy even if you end up working with Java.
[Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/36/11/how-do-i-start-using-dynamic-dns) Their official client is windows only, but I had success with [ddclient](https://sourceforge.net/p/ddclient/wiki/Home/) for Linux. Namecheap also has a list of clients that work with them on their support pages.
Then i think I'll pick python
I recommend you to start by reading the Scrapy [documentation](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/index.html). As to crawl several websites I normally create one spider per site and if necessary handle different pages on that site by having more than one parse function (parse_list, parse_product). Glue that together on the main parse function and you are done.

You cannot expect a programming language to stick around forever. Like it or not, COBOL is dying and businesses have failed to port over to new language and systems timely, leading to a hiring problem of their own doing. How is that not a giant fuckup for any company still running COBOL? You can't fix a system if you can't hire someone to fix it.

Yes- it is [Open Sans Condensed Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans+Condensed), which is a standard in the industry but my eyes don't like it. The spacing, particularly the titles are eye sandpaper.
Not a library as such but http://entrian.com/goto/ would probably be fun to port to Python 3.
Yeah it makes sense, I might try adding something like this, but it might be a while becasue of a backlog of other feature. &amp;#x200B; I don't think Atom is more friendly per se, but I guess they have more integration points. The entire dev environment for extensions in VSCode is really nice. I'm looking at how Hydrogen implements inline eval, and I might make a feature request to VSCode's team to make that style of integration possible!
Namecheap still doesn't support let's encrypt, right?
Dynu.net charges?
That's the better choice for a starter imo. It's actually easier/faster to make useful tools with it as well with all of the built in libraries and online examples
Thanks for the heads up!
Yeah I use no-ip as well, it’s easy to confirm so I just use the free tier still
What is a "windows"? Not everyone uses windows. 
If you literally need a periodic (not-async scheduling) task runner just use kronos. If you're using django, you can even django-kronos your management commands with a single decorator, and deploy/redeploy/automate even the cronjob provisioning. It's pretty stellar.

Concurrency is not about multiple cores, that's parallelism. Concurrency is handling multiple things at the same time, by time-sharing a single core. Parallelism is about actually doing things at the same time.
It's also a great way to create a highly usable interface, particularly if the code itself is small enough and simple enough that the mental burden of active setters is not too high. Like duck typing and operator overloading, python *will* let you set yourself on fire, because fire is a useful tool.
You put the transaction start / rollback in the test code itself. If your database doesn't support nested transactions this can get awkward. I was wrong about Postgres, it doesn't have an in-memory option. I guess in the past I've just used disc backed DBs when testing on PG. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7872693/running-postgresql-in-memory-only

&gt; Will Python ever become faster? Yes. Computers get faster over time. &gt; Will lower level features become exposed now that Python+data science is taking off? It's been taking off all 13 years I've been coding Python. More C/Fortran/Assembly code gets wrapped. Numpy is a much better package than numarray or numeric.
Hi I am a beginner in Python and I'm 14, I want to persuade a career in artificial intelligence. 1. What should I focus on? 2. What needs to be learnt? A questions about academics: 1. What subjects should I a focus on or Excel at? (maths, ICT...) 2. What colleges should I study in if I want to study artificial intelligence? 3. Should I have knowledge on computer science before studying artificial intelligence?
I your ETL has several steps and you want to be able to restart from the middle if one of those fails, then Airflow is a great choice for you. It will also provide the scheduler and allow independent steps to be run in parallel. But be aware, Airflow is not a library but a service that has to be deployed. It only makes sense for projects that will be run for a long time.
Doent apply to me but is this for any web stuff?
Don't reinvent the wheel. Use cronjobs or windows task scheduler...
Wow that is very cool!
&gt; conda, anaconda Well those two are the same. My opinion is each group is trying to solve a different problem. I like Anaconda's solution, but other people like poetry or pip or pipenv. Linux/Mac are lucky in that yum/apt/brew (you only get one) even exist. May the best package manager win. Until poetry and pip include a C compiler that's Anaconda as I'm on Windows.

I started with Java and have since focused on Python but that is because I changed my domain from enterprise development to data analytics. I like python for that particular job... and web development... and process automation... etc. You get the point, I really enjoy the flexibility of Python without getting bogged down in what I call "fluff" code.
I'm not sure what you mean. Are you talking about their hosting service? In which case, I have no clue. They probably don't officially support it cause they want to sell you their expensive ssl certs. But if you're hosting yourself, idk why letsencrypt wouldn't work. I've gotten letsencrypt to work with namecheap dynamic dns + Apache + certbot on a raspberry pi. But idk, it was a while ago, so maybe something has changed.
&gt; Concurrency is handling multiple things at the same time, by time-sharing a single core. I don't think most definitions of concurrency dictate that it be done on a single core. I think most people would define parallelism as a kind of concurrent programming. ------------------ That said I think it is fair to argue that in some ways asyncio isn't actually concurrency (at least not in any meaningful way), because it doesn't actually provide any asynchronous primitives. Effectively speaking the only way to return control to the async loop is to sleep, so you can only do multiple things at one time by doing nothing... So you can have an async loop that repeatedly reads a file, and when there is no data in that file to process, and it would otherwise be idle, it can make more efficient use of the system by doing something else. But it isn't actually doing two things at once. If you use something like aiofiles which provides a poll base file reading mechanism (instead of select), then you can have something truly asynchronous. However that isn't part of asyncio, and what asyncio provides for most people is a way to manage multiple threads of activity via a cooperative scheduler and run_in_executor calls. 
You can still TDD, just no need to mock
Doing a program version of the Hill Cipher
If you call ’pip3 freeze &gt; requirements.txt’ it will output all the dependencies that you have installed through pip to a file called ’requirements.txt’. Note however that if you are not working in a virtualenv that it will put everything that you have installed through pip on your computer, which may not be the dependencies needed for that project.
How expensive are the transformations? Unless they take a very long time and you need to be able to resume halfway it sounds like Airflow at least would be overkill (I'm not familiar with bonobo). 5000 rows wouldn't normally be considered too many for pandas to deal with.
You clearly didnt read the article. Considering you post to T_D and said in the past "OOP is dead", you're the idiot who doesn't understand the evolving world. I'm blocking you on reddit, as I'm no longer interested in talking in circles with you. Have a good day. 
Are there any plans to add high-level async modules to the standard library? (eg. async http)
It's customary to start a request like this with the word 'please'.
I use Namecheap with Let's Encrypt as well. It works for me. I am using the Caddy web server which manages the LE process on its own, so I don't know if it is using some sort of workaround or not.
Last week I migrated the reddit bot to 3.6 so for now it works in python 2.7 and 3.6 and added a quiet mode so it's easier make updates and test them without running the risk of making a comment. This week I plan on expanding the quiet mode so it can be called from the raspberry pi main wrapper, not just the bot's main, as well as outlining it's local database structure (which features of a post can I save, which should I ignore). I also might migrate my twitter bots to run with python 3.6 as well as 2.7

Hm... interesting. I'll take a look again. I remember namecheap only supports OV/EV, so Let's Encrypt is out of the question unless you have hosting service there.
Yea, you can do namecheap with let's encrypt with hosting plan. Maybe that's what you have?
Yup, I also use namecheap for dynamic DNS with one of my domains. Linux ddclient works, as well as whatever pfsense / FreeBSD uses. You can update your record with a simple curl / HTTP request actually (the IP argument might be optional, in which case it uses whatever IP made the request). I've also used Cloudflare for this on other domains. Just transfer your domain's DNS to Cloudflare (you don't need to change your registrar), and set all the records to bypass Cloudflare's proxy/optimization (unless you want to use it). Cloudflare DNS is probably more reliable and faster than your registrar's (such as Namecheap, who I've had DNS problems with in the past). 
Have you done it via dynamic DNS configuration?
Ah I see, you're saying it's missing automatic constraint solving for the versions.

Yes, there are occasionally cases where tests interfere with each other, but we almost always find a way to isolate them. I.e. instead of "search the whole database", instead search for a specific combination of random words that I included in the data I just created.
OK. I figure as much. Yea, I was running a project from my own RPI. I couldn't get let's encrypt to work. I'm switching to google domain for my next project.
Yeah, this code base is recovering from a past filled with extensive mocking and very confusing/time consuming "unit" tests (which were really not very "unit" in nature). If you can write your stuff in a sane way from scratch, you've got it good.

1. Well, there's this one guy doing interviews... 2. You tested it, haven't you? 
&gt; In retrospect, I think that I dodged a bullet. You lost a golden opportunity to have your own column on [TDWTF](https://thedailywtf.com/). But you're probably right about the bullet.
I can only say sth to number one: I think they want to check if you a) Do what they want you to do b) You know basic stuff
Oops, thanks
There's always been debate about whether that fits the definition of a unit test. You're not testing one isolated part of your code; you're testing your procedural code + your SQL it generates + the DB library you use + connection to the database + the database's own complex logic.
That's not what the question is about. The question is to see how you think. It's also about seeing your attitude under pressure, and I don't want this to come off poorly, but as described, I probably wouldn't hire you. In an interview, you don't tell the interviewer that something is stupid, you say that it's probably not the best way to do it, the built-in functions are very efficient but sure, here's how I'd approach it. Then you go over your solution, and ask how they'd do it, then compare the two, and reiterate that you'd use the built-in functions or some such, but you have an amicable, friendly discussion and hopefully everyone leaves with a smile.
I think '!=' should be '==' 
For those interested, the obfuscation is an early encryption algorithm https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13
Maybe he was just seeing how you reacted to the problem? I ask a question that is easier when the input is sorted, I usually let them finish that answer then explain the input could be any arbitrary length to try to solve without sorting. It’s much more difficult and we then engage in question/answer and so forth. There isn’t a right answer but I can tell if they know how to code by the lack of pseudo code. Some devs try to bull shit their way through interviews without coding. Also, I have turned down technically qualified candidates because they just want to argue that they are right. Why do I want to manage that person? No thanks. 
**ROT13** ROT13 ("rotate by 13 places", sometimes hyphenated ROT-13) is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it, in the alphabet. ROT13 is a special case of the Caesar cipher which was developed in ancient Rome. Because there are 26 letters (2×13) in the basic Latin alphabet, ROT13 is its own inverse; that is, to undo ROT13, the same algorithm is applied, so the same action can be used for encoding and decoding. The algorithm provides virtually no cryptographic security, and is often cited as a canonical example of weak encryption.ROT13 is used in online forums as a means of hiding spoilers, punchlines, puzzle solutions, and offensive materials from the casual glance. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
I recently went to a security training where the expert suggested a couple tools for wiping drives... maybe I should send this to him
I would just use strip() and like the other guy said switch != with ==
So if you have 33 years experience, that’s a bit more than I’ve even been alive, and I’m a computer/electric engineer, not a computer scientist. Just wanted to include that background as I think it’s important for where I’m coming from. That said, I can’t imagine a reason to ever rewrite core library functions. It’s always been presented as a bad thing, and for numerous reasons. Besides that, it certainly isn’t a very “pythonic” way to go about problem solving. I know some people scoff at the idea of pythonic coding, but as an engineer, I see the value of it every day. Norms and standards literally keep the world running in the age of the internet with computers everywhere (see IEEE standards). My point is, if a company requires such flagrant deviation from the norms for ALL code, what have they done on lower levels that requires that? Either they’re just more advanced than anyone else in the world (doubt it), or they’ve got some janky shit going on (more likely). I say bullet dodged. Just my two cents. 
This isn't too wacky, but have fun: https://github.com/wroberts/pydaedalus
If I was asked this, I would answer: "If I wanted to be that fast, I wouldn't use python in the first place". &amp;#x200B; Reimplementing the standard library sounds a lot like something a C dev would think of and it's the kind of people I don't want to see around Python code. If there are faster implementations in Python, I can look them up on the internet. The effort of rewriting the stuff is never worth it. If still they insist reimplementing the standard library is something a reasonable person would do, I just quit the interview and go somewhere else.
So why change the major version?
When someone c9mes up with a good alternative.

It's 50% +1 people, but yeah. It's an exponential problem. We're switching very soon.
Continuing to work on a processing workflow for a geophysical instrument. I guess it's my job so not as interesting, but I'm a geophysicist not a programmer so it counts. The instrument is a magnetic gradiometer array, towed behind an ATV. Each of 48 sensors produces 81 bytes of data every 4 milliseconds, plus GPS and IMU data. The data are broken up into farmer's fields-sized blocks, which are about a GB a piece. The processing includes binary data import, timing corrections (system clock to GPS), yaw/pitch/roll corrections from the IMU through a quaternion rotation, position interpolation, calibration, despike and bandpass filtering, principal component analysis, gridding and display, and geotiff output. Python has operated flawlessly. Here's the kicker: when it's complete, my boss wants it translated to incorporate into a large software package. The language? Delphi. Delphi.

Can I get a NSFW warning for fucks sake
You could write your own crazy library, for example something that spawns a thread moving a random file to a random place at random intervals.
I'd hire that person lol
I don't mean to sound rude, but do a web search. There are so many.
&gt; I was supposed to merge two arrays together in python, no duplicates - no mention of time but the solution had to be size agnostic. There actually is a use case for knowing how to to this in the abstract, namely when the data won't all fit into memory. So you might get iterators A and B which you know are sorted (maybe the data is coming from a database) and you need to merge join them. Honestly I'm not sure why itertools doesn't provide an merge_join function to do this (maybe there is something fancy with takewhile and dropwhile... but its not obvious or natural), so it isn't a terrible question.
Sublime Text was praised by my colleagues running MacOSX. I can recommend Vim if you are not scared of a terminal and typing commands. Pianists love Emacs, which is also a powerful editor. 
&gt; How many of you really think it's a good idea to rework the python library functions? Generally speaking? No. For specific cases? Maybe. You'd need to profile^profile^profile and ensure you can't just remove the work entirely, but sometimes you're bottlenecked on the standard library (or even a builtin) and a specialised construct is faster than the general one, even if the general one is well-optimised
I absolutely love TextWrangler. It’s always my go-to when I just want an editor without a full IDE. It’s clean and works great. You can create a good workflow around that editor and a terminal window. If you fancy a full IDE tho, check out Spyder. It’s even included in the anaconda package of SciPy. 
This is my first programming course so I don’t know a lot but with these text editors can you open .py files written by other text editors? Because with my assignments they give us a .py file and tell us to edit that file to hand in. 
Visual Studio Code (vscode). It is wonderful. Sublime Text is also great. Its faster than Visual Studio Code, but its not as nice IMO.
&gt; Reimplementing the standard library sounds a lot like something a C dev would think of Nope. "Boost" was made by the C++ crowd. &gt; it's the kind of people I don't want to see around Python code Your loss. The best way to speed up Python is still rewriting modules in C or in something that transpiles to C, like Cython.
Yep. 
&gt; Your loss. The best way to speed up Python is still rewriting modules in C or in something that transpiles to C, like Cython. That's a different topic and we do this extensively in my company. But if you try to write Python as if it was C without pointers and malloc, that's a problem. &amp;#x200B;
Ok thank you. What is an IDE? Sorry if I sound really ignorant
No, I don't have a hosting plan. I only use them for DNS and host on a VPS.
They were not testing your knowledge of the python standard library, they were testing your knowledge of algorithms. According to my professor, the correct way to reverse a string in an interview is to create a Stack. The correct way to do it in practice is to call the standard library's reverse method.
IDE is an application, that combines code editor (text editor) with tools to aide development, like debugging, refactorisation, analisis, profiling etc. It's all integrated, so for example, you can jump in code and peek into variables in the editor while debugging. It will also alert you about possible problems and syntax errors during the edit. Download PyCharm and try it out.
Personally I'd go with VS-Code or Atom.
sublime is prob the easiest intro. as another mentioned, vim could be useful but probably overwhelming at first. i'm partial to sublime for python as well considering white space is part of the code. in sublime, you can run the code with a simple `cmd + b`, so it makes it nice in comparison to switching back and forth from the terminal.
Best of luck! I'm currently on ex27. If you ever want a buddy, lmk!
Try using Google's I'm feeling lucky 
\^ Really good way to respond. &amp;#x200B; Though, there are probably some companies that ask these questions in this way and are poorly managed so maybe the OP dodged a bullet? &amp;#x200B; This seems like a very odd question to ask for a Sr. SWE position... But I've never interviewed for one myself so maybe I'm missing something.
Same for fritzbox.
IDE or Integrated Development Environment are softwares that other than the text editor, add some more functionality such as debugging, run, compiling (for languages who need that), text highlight (nowadays most of the text editor have this functionality too), breakpoint, etc. Notepad++ on steroids. Other than VSCode that has been suggested, you can also try Atom for MacOS.
I'm totally newbie but based on my understanding, such coding interview is really not about getting an optimal solution, it's more about how you think of a problem and how you make your solution better step by step, and how you communicate with others. The algorithms have already been there for tens of years if not hundreds, why are we still writing sorting and combining here, right? Speaking of reinvent the wheel, most of the time I would be skeptical about it.
You were right. Python has Timsort which works well on presorted subsequences. It was created by Tim Peters specifically for python and has found its way in many other programming languages. Is even was part of Oracles patent case against Google if I recall correctly. These people were asking stupid questions for a senior position. They should have been testing your seniority and ability to lead and teach. 
Open the network tab in your dev tools, then watch to see what happens when you perform a search the normal way. If you're lucky, you might see how the browser sends the search query to the backend and be able to copy it. Obviously only works on some sites though
It's the first time I hear about the project. From the description on the website it seems like this would be the memory backend for higher level libraries like Pandas. Would this mean that arrow could become an alternative backend besides numpy or could it even integrate with numpy?
FINALLY! Finally someone said that :-D
You failed at that
merging of two sorted arrays is beyond just running sort on something. and as /u/nickbernstein said the point is to see how you approach it. and in a response to your 2 loops I would write a single loop that took 3 indexes and `while (i&lt;len(a1) and j&lt;len(a2))` and check for which is less and insert at a3[k]
As someone who frequently interviews candidates for python development positions I must say that I agree with you a 100%. Even more so, I EXPECT people to use stdlib as much as possible in the interview questions and not implement anything like that themselves. So you definitely dodged a bullet and you should feel good about yourself 
Editor wise for me is VsCode I can suggest the settings sync extension which gives you the same experience no matter on which computer you are :-) (windows Linux or Mac) Python wise I use a lot pycharm community edition is free but I believe as a student you qualify for a free Pro license
Thanks will do. : )
I came here to say this. Grab PyCharm. It's what all the cool kids use.
Working on a blackjack game right now. Started late last night so I've just got dealing out the hands and totaling them, but I'll have hitting/standing and the game loop up quick. Then it's betting (then special bets like for blackjack), special actions (like splitting), statistics, and saving that money/stats data.
[bottle](https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle) has a great codebase. It’s a flask-like framework that’s actually micro and very well written and documented.
Honestly, senior dev shouldn't be asked questions like this at all. I would rather ask him what is the hardest problem he had and how was it solved, which stack of technology and approaches they used and why they thinks it was a right/best way to do it. Plus point if they take into account cost/time of development. Asking senior about for loops seems like a waste of time.
sneaking suspicious you got turned down because of ageism (or just their inability to meet your reasonable salary requirements with your experience level) and got told a buncha off-the-cuff bullshit when you asked, cuz they're really really really not allowed to say the real reason. 
The joke just flew past you... ;) 
Nice podcast! I'm very impressed by the guest list that you've accumulated in such a short time. Subscribed :)
nice! I made a simple blackjack game a while back - sounds like you're trying to cover all the details!
dashboard in what sense? 
I’m currently doing a course on computer algorithms, and this sounds like a question ripped straight from the course. It’s not about any particular language or any particular library. It’s about knowing a bunch of well known algorithms, their efficiency, and how to apply them. 
Flipping a random bit on a block device at random intervals sounds like fun.
You have asked one of the biggest questions in programming. Join the flame war.
It's an application than a library, but I rather like [Legofy](https://github.com/trancilo/Gif-Lego-ify), "a python program that takes a static image or gif and makes it so that it looks as if it was built out of LEGO."
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
That’s basically what I did :-) 
Well written and a beautiful approach!
Use pip update regularly and update you OS regularly. Also subscribe to security mail lists to keep up to date.
Currently im in a similar position as you are. They gave me this task/project to evaluate my level. And the libs that i have to use are not supported so i have to do a lot of manually task. I have done the same task using the documentation libs and the task is completed. But they ask to be written manually as they decided to go on the project with the same scenarios tools and libs. And on top of it they tell me take all the time you need. So my feeling is like working on a project and not on a task. I would play the same role as you. :)
Especially when you implement it in an alarm clock. The more you snooze, the more you lose.
Ooh someone's hurt. Submitting a link to multiple subreddits doesn't inherently constitute spam, I post plentyo of other things. However, reporting under false pretenses can get you banned, as well as encouraging others to do so.
1: /r/learnpython 2: did you google something like "python metronome"? Cause I just did and I sure found metronomes written in python... 3: don't be lazy
i wish i could downvote this twice
The big picture I think is that if say your database supports arrow, you can “extend” it in basically any language without the overhead of serialisation/deserialisation. In a similar way to how numpy arrays utilise the same memory layout as the underlying lapack/blas functions it calls and hence why numpy is so fast (no memory copies to and from python memory space)
My library, distract_meme. Displays a random. meme every given time
I would look up time in python. https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html You are going to need to be as precise as possible. Then you want to set up a loop that can start and stop either with the press of a button, or when the script starts/ends. So for example you could have something like: ```py metronome.py --bpm 120``` And it'll play at 120 beats per minute until you hit enter.
If the arrays are pre-sorted, you can merge them in O(n). Any kind of sort will be O(n log n), and regardless of how much faster the built-in sort is, there will be a data size where the O(n) loop is faster.
It's super fast and compresses very well. Prefer it to csv any day. Compression is especially good when pulling data from a database that has a lot of by-row repeated data. It's also quite easy to use.
Thanks, can you recommend any security mail lists?
Hey, thanks for the advice! I really appreciate it! :)
You are "technically" right. But it is more like "see if you can think like me" rather then "how do you think". I think this is how CS questions are made in college/university and the interviewer reflect it (meaning he is not focused on software engineering) As an interviewer, we had 3 simple questions we used to role out candidates who have hard time to write reasonable code. IMO simpler is better, so no need for memory / runtime efficiency. Having said that, we did have an overlooking for stackoverflow / max recursion, but without need to implement the "correct" code.
&gt; what is the hardest problem they had and how was it solved Despite 10+ years of experience, I draw a blank on this... Perhaps because all the "hardest" were unsolveable legacy issues. 
Checkout Mu: it’s designed to be easy to use for beginners, but still includes a debugger! Knowing how to use a debugger is an invaluable skill and a great way to peek into the mechanics of how python actually works.
Nice.
Something I can tie in with my Gitlab Issues, LibreNMS, environmental monitors (DIY) and probably a few other projects as time permits
Right? I haven't run into a "hardest problem" because I always break down large problems into small manageable problems. So nothing really sticks out in my mind as "hardest problem." 
Jeeze guys, don't downvote someone that contributes to the conversation with alternatives!
&gt; Just because someone dresses well doesn't mean they're unintelligent. You subtly implied that in your 2nd paragraph. I didn't mean to. Not in the slightest. What I was trying to get across is the notion that programmers are generally more attracted to minds than to appearances. &gt; You feel vulnerable because dressing poorly lowers your societal value so you're trying to raise it by bringing up intelligence. What makes you think I feel vulnerable? What makes you think I "dress poorly"? What makes you think that the way I dress (which, may I remind you, you have no idea of) is the result of an inability on my side, rather than choice? What makes you think I have "low societal value"? &gt; Truth is, the way someone dresses has zero correlation to their intelligence. Of course. Again, I didn't mean to imply that; I was merely sketching two extremes to illustrate my point.
I agree with you 100% so I guess I am not adding much value. I do have one case where I've replaced built in functionality though. We had some code that had to deal with large collections of objects that internally were doing a copy.deepcopy operation. The data structures being copied had a limited number of types they could contain so a __fastcopy helper was created, the performance difference was significant. I would consider this a rare case however given deepcopy is known to be slow.
