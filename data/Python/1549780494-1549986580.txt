Ahh yeah, China is a bit of a special case. Fastly has had a lot of issues with working with the Chinese government. There are a few unofficial mirrors in-country but we do advise caution as PyPI has no provisions for dealing with a hostile mirror server.
Good course. Heavier on maths than Ng's course. But Dasgupta explains the concepts very well.

1) Ask r/learnpython and 2) Look up the JSON module for storing lists/dictionaries 
Read the data into a pandas dataframe and then use the [describe function](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.describe.html). It can also make a [histogram](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.hist.html). 
that's exactly what Im looking for. Thank you 
You start by reading the sidebar. And then going to /r/learnpython like it says in the sidebar. And then read THAT sidebar, which is full of excellent learning resources.
Well done, this is also very interesting! How much time spent?
I'm an idiot. Thank you though
I disagree, `iter()` is not a hack, and it was designed for use cases like this in mind. The `for` loop generally is preferred for finite iteration, like reading entire file, while the `while` loop is meant for loops where it is not certain when the loop stops. There might, be good use case for the walrus operator, but I don't believe this is a good one. The pattern suggested here is popular from languages like C.
You're good, dude - just start reading sidebars before posting :D
Not throw a parser error, and have a somewhat complete `typing` module. It's really not very complex, but it is also currently missing.

It's not the classroom license, it's the student license (individual) [read here](https://libraries.io/github/JetBrains/swot) &gt;If an organization provides primary and secondary education only (i.e., no high or higher education programs), it shall not be included into the list. Primary and secondary school students usually do not need professional developer tools, and in case they learn some programming, we are glad to offer them Community versions of the tools, which are free to everybody, such as PyCharm Community Edition, etc.) I mean I can deal with it, it's just painful and time consuming to rewrite some of my resources. And I don't know which features the community edition doesn't have but we're working heavily with flask and sqlite and apparently it doesn't have all the integrated database tools. 
Oh wow didn’t know that. Wiwndering if pip will get virtualenv building too
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar
Please see requests repository to see how to solve pipenv+setup.py problem. You are not supposed to install the same drops in both files, just install setup.py from pipenv. Installation of pre releases for single package can be easily done by pinning version of that package in Pipfile. As attitude goes that is (subjectively) sadly true, I believe it has something to do with popularity and amount of tickets. Pipenv is still quite new and rough around the egdes, but at least it has proven to break production release less often than surprise update from any the transintien dependencies. Please make sure you pin the version of Pipenv you are using in docker or other environment for that to be true for you too.
I tend to put pipenv (with --system) in docker as well as for me the main feature of pipenv is freezing the whole dependency tree
check this [https://stackoverflow.com/a/47785513](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47785513)
The second! There's a PEP recently approved that introduces a __pypackages__ directory. Exciting times for python dev workflow!
Why not just use setuptools? Start with this: https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#configuring-setup-using-setup-cfg-files (just make sure you have virtualenv with the latest version of setuptools and pip) Just add: [options.entry_points] myprogram = package.module:function Which will create CLI command "myprogram" that will start specified function. Define only immediate requirements using `install_requires=` If you want to get fancy, add setuptools_scm to `setup_requires` (don't forget to enable it) and it will take package version from last git tag.
I don't pip attempts to make dependency freezes any easier any time soon which is among main points of uaing pipenv and poetry
nice! I just started doing games in Löve with Lua (I'm used to Python of course so it's a bit more tough than usual). Today I made my first simple game I hope to see more little games like this here!
I tend to like pip-tools for dependency pinning. Its a small utility that avoids magic, is made to do _one_ thing and for me, just works.
Have you tried pinning prereleases? It doesn’t find it. You can only get ore releases for the whole pipfile 
In ideal world, yes, you just have a bunch of candidates and pick the best one. In reality the things are more complicated. For example, a so-called internal candidate may take the position, or a company may close it before somebody is hired. Or there may be two or more candidates with similar skills or with their own strengths and weaknesses which are not directly interchangeable
As long as your game is simple enough, it could be replicated in pygame by adding the base code to get pygame to render, then changing your print and input functions to wrappers that will call the appropriate code in pygame to display text or take user input. Done right, the code that handles your game logic shouldn't need to change very much at all. Just bear in mind that working in a graphical environment carries extra effort to make things work in a way you already take for granted. A good example of that would be text scroll. In a standard console program, just putting \\n in your string produces a new line. In your pygame code, you would have to code this functionality yourself, as well as a function to scroll the text once it gets too long. Since you're moving from a pre-built text interface to one you're designing yourself based on pixel graphics, you'll be taking certain things onto yourself you normally don't think anything of. Nonetheless, it could be a very fun project if you're willing to put the time in. Pygame includes a text rendering function by default, so that isn't something you'll need to worry about at least. tl;dr: By adding base pygame code and making custom functions to handle IO, you could get away with changing almost none of your original code.
Hi Thanks for mentioning f strings! I did not know about them. But just to say something in the topic: As about your question, my OPPINION is, that it should not be a problem during work. I am a programmer with few years of experience and there's nothing wrong in looking at stack overflow or Google for the best solution or snippets. I works not worry about it, if it does not make you code too slow. This may not be true for some jobs, that require repetitive tasks and fast iterations. But some jobs require programmer to cover many topics, e. g. I may need to create a webservice, parse text, manipulate files, do some high performance math, use many different apis and write &amp; compile some C module during the same day. So no one would expect anyone to do this from his memory alone. Maybe you're just a person that should look for such job.
Should probably have run gunicorn with a less priveleged user than admin. 
Author of Poetry here! &amp;#x200B; Poetry does not support \`.env\` files, that's true, and I don't plan on adding support for it because this is beyond the scope of a package/dependency manager. &amp;#x200B; &gt;deceitfully, scripts doesnt run scripts like it does in npm. but its to run scripts when installing. &amp;#x200B; Well, Poetry just doesn't use the same terminology as npm's, this does not mean it's deceitful. And yes something similar to npm's scripts is planned. Someone already made a PR that I think I will eventually merge in Poetry (see [https://github.com/sdispater/poetry/pull/591](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry/pull/591)). &amp;#x200B;
If you aren't doing it with the purpose of learning how to write a parser/emitter, you should just use the JSON module instead of writing your own.
I also used to have a script that freezes deps before building the container image. Freeze with pipenv and install with pip. This way i dont need the venv at all when in docker, but can use the same codebase outside docker using a venv. IIRC pip will have a pipenv integration some day, as it can install from the pipenv.lock directly
When you get a value with `input()`, it's treated as a piece of text. If you want to treat it as a number, you need to convert it to a numeric type. Use `int(input())` for whole numbers or `float(input())` for decimal numbers.

Pipenv is more for projects and apps that you (or your company) run directly, that's where the deterministic locking system comes into play. If you want to provide a way for others to install it, then you should have dependencies as ranges of compatible versions, instead of pinpointed (locked) versions. Pipenv with its `Pipfile` "replace" `requirements.txt` and venv. But not the tools for distribution. If you want an alternative to `setup.py` for distribution, you can try one of the projects that use `pyproject.toml`. Mainly Flit and Poetry. [Flit](https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) "replaces" setuptools (`setup.py`), you don't need a `setup.py` anymore. Only the (for me, easier to maintain) `pyproject.toml`. [Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/) "replaces" setuptools (`setup.py`) and `requirements.txt` (and also Pipenv) at the same time. It puts everything in the same file. But the versions thing still applies. It's just in the same file now. I created a couple packages with setuptools (`setup.py`) and it felt quite messy. I recently started using Flit and I'm loving it. It does a lot of the things you would have to hack around "by default". Try it once, check the tutorial, in 5 minutes you have a package ready, published and installable. That combination, Pipenv for development and Flit for releasing is what I'm using in FastAPI: https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi Poetry has a lot of fans too. It seems that PyPA (the guys that run PyPI) is not endorsing Poetry for differences in their ideas of "how things should be done", but it seems that would be a perfectly good alternative too.
Having gone down this route before, this is not worth the _considerable_ effort that's required to get it to work reliably, if you even can (depends on platform and display and window manager configuration), but more importantly it's _kind_ of an abuse of your user. You can't know that they don't have accessibility concerns that force them to use something outside your desired dimensions, or even just preferences . At the most you should set an initial size -- there's ways of resizing x-Windows terminals with curses -- but even that will annoy anyone using a tiling WM.

Realtime text adventure game with menus? Use a regular desktop app gui like Tkinter. You can display images in that as well. Turn based text adventure? Isn't that just a visual novel, where the menu prompts advance the story? Use Renpy. If the images are part of the interface, like a graphical inventory paper doll, pygame sounds OK, but you can calll pygame from inside Renpy. 
I haven’t timed it, but it’s not the fastest process. Probably 5-10 minutes for that. I might see if I can speed it up with some threading. 
It’s not the whole film, just a 30 second trailer, and I’m not monetizing it, so I think I’ll roll the dice. If you tube takes it down, so be it. 
what if you have multiple internal projects that depend on each other? thats the exact problem im facing and its a pita

Have you used VS Code? It's electron and it's pretty great.
hey, thanks for the response. i would like to challenge your logic on setting env vars being beyond the scope of poetry. whats the point of `poetry run`? that command sets the virtualenv up to run your script right? if youre already setting up some stuff that bring into scope adding a few more things to allow the script to run fully as intended? In the pr you linked the task sets its own env vars in the bash command. what if you have a bigger list of variables? do you flood .toml file with env vars for every task? I am having this weird argument about incompleteness with maintainers of pipenv and peotry now, therefore its most likely i am wrong.
Very cool! I've been mostly focused on web development and haven't studied much game development lately but I still have a great love for it, seeing others creating games and l learning stuff is awesome, really liked playing the game. I didn't find a way to restart the game besides quitting and running it again when I died so I just added two lines to the code: &amp;#x200B; `if dead:` `setVariables()` &amp;#x200B; on line 113, now when I press space and the bird is dead, the variables will be restarted and the game as well, it was nice to "hack" the game somehow, feels good xD &amp;#x200B; Hope you keep learning and come up with awesome stuff!

Yes I had used that for like a year and half. It used to be great but as the program advanced they focues on Javascript features and stuff like in-app terminal (such a nonsense) instead of really IDE-ish features like overloading, outline or better performance. Also the program just couldn't hold like 5k lines of source while sustain fluent in performance and decent in memory consumption. When I tried to open some logs it just crashed. With 10 open files of my project the memory consumption was ~3gig after like a day of usage. VSCode is good for begginers and mid-advanced. Once you really need the real tool you just go back to Vim or similar. P.S. Reminds me Java. They put enormous effort in but you cant go behind technology boundaries. I only imagine what the software would be if they went for C/C++/Rust instead of "emulated" environment.

Can Flit describe how to compile native extensions, which versions of `yacc` and `lex` should be used (make sure those aren't vanilla `yacc` and `lex`, but rather GNU Bison and Flex), can it compile and packages shared libraries depending on what OS you are running on, or, better yet, depending on command-line options (to support cross-compilation)? Can it pass defines variables to the C code for native extensions or set extra source paths for headers and libraries for those extensions? And what about compiling extensions written in Fortran, Go or Rust? What about source distributions (those that come in a form of compressed TAR file)? The way to install them is to run `setup.py` afaikt, and I am not aware of any other way of doing that. What about run-time discovery of installed package assets, non-source-code files? Can it do any of this?
How's that even relevant? Or, are you installing packages inside container buy downloading them with `curl` and then unzipping them and moving their parts into appropriate directories, then parse their dependency requirements, download dependencies and repeat the process? All by hand? I bet you don't even know where to put all the bits and pieces of the packages you would have downloaded in such way... Probably, you just use `pip`, whereas Docker serves as just a more expensive and inconvenient virtual environment, with slightly improved isolation.
I've tried most if not all of the tools mentioned in this thread. My impression so far: `setuptools` suck, but everything else sucks more. Sometimes, if you don't need to solve the packaging problem in general, you may not run into the problem that a particular tool exposes, and you'll be just fine using whatever tool that just happened to cover your case. Where most of the new and shiny tools fail: native extensions, alternative implementations of the interpreter. Surprisingly, increasingly, Linux support appears to be a dying art... If even about five years ago, you'd rarely see a Python programmer working on Windows, today it's mainstream. Oh, and interop between these new and shiny tools basically doesn't exist (unless a tool is built to just use another tool, like `pipenv` uses `pip`, in which case, it's use pattern is very hard to justify or modify).
A better place to post this is /r/learnpython.
There's way more important things than your choice of a framework to get your project off the ground.
And installs a massive amount of files in the user folder of every remote file system you connect to. 
Yeah that's pretty obvious, which is why I'm asking about the thing I'm most in doubt of :)
How do you deploy them? As source code directly? Maybe just a `PYTHONPATH` including those sources could do it. (but I doubt this is the case). As installable packages with `pip`, `pipenv` that you can upload to PyPI? Then you can try Flit or Poetry. Does anyone else depend on/use those packages? If not, you can just declare the dependencies with fixed versions. E.g., FastAPI only depends on Starlette and Pydantic. As both of those are versions `0.x.x`, following SemVer, any version change could modify the API. So, they are pinned to the exact versions/ranges that are tested to work. And before allowing a newer version, I have to test it locally. So, it's a kind of soft "locking", in the `pyproject.toml` (equivalent to `setup.py`). Are those interdependent packages installable with `pip`, `pipenv`, etc but you can't upload them to PyPI openly? You can still build the distributables with Flit or Poetry. Then distribution would have to be by one of: * Manually (or automatically) copying those distributables (`wheel`) to your production servers. * Cloning the code and building them on those servers. * Using a local PyPI-like server, like: https://pypi.org/project/pypiserver/ In another completely different scenario, if you have something like web services/micro-services, you could handle versions at another level, with Docker, containers, etc. But I guess this is not the kind of problem you're handling right now.
Depending on the project, either of the two will fit better, but since there's scarce information, it's hard to advise. Don't pick a framework based on "feel".
Nope. If you need to do low-level binary extensions stuff, you still need `setup.py`. Although I think you can combine it with `pyproject.toml`, I'm not sure of the whole process. For simpler, pure-Python projects, I think Flit/Poetry is a lot easier. Just to clarify, Flit doesn't replace or change the way you _install_ packages, with `pip`, `pipenv` or any other. It is just for distributing and publishing. For more info about the `pyproject.toml` file (used by Flit and Poetry) and how it relates to `setup.py`, check Brett Cannon's post: https://snarky.ca/clarifying-pep-518/
Flask allows you to do things in multiple ways. This is great if you know just what you want and are working alone. If you aren't sure or are needing other people to know exactly what choice you made then django is probably your better choice.
I second that ! Besides, the Django documentation is extensive and well written, so it's easy for a newcomer to grasp the framework good practices.
Just use Docker or LXD. 
So this is dead code?
I love buildout too. 
FYI: https://github.com/nvbn/py-backwards
Flask is more lightweight and quick to start. Django a bit more structured. However if you are new to python learn python first. Especially if u are a noobie. However if u have other experience with web frameworks, see my first two sentences and ignore the noob comment

&gt; Just to clarify, Flit doesn't replace or change the way you install packages So, it generates `setup.py`? Because there's no other way to install from sources besides running `setup.py some-command`... I kind of fail to see the point then... it would be really the same effort: either you write `setup.py` by hand, or you write a file that you have no way of verifying for correctness, no way of debugging or discovering the features of?.. What am I winning? Seems like maybe a "new and shiny technology user" beige, but nothing of real value :/ 
Good one
&gt; Because there's no other way to install from sources besides running `setup.py` [...] Yes, there is. With `pip`, `pipenv` and others. They now support projects with `pyproject.toml`. `pip` PR adding support for it is here (from 2017): https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/4144 But again, in your specific case, doing low-level extensions stuff, it probably doesn't make sense to move away from `setup.py`. Just for the other cases.
But I don't care about `pip`. I think it's a pile of garbage and don't want to use it. I want to use `setuptools`. I don't think `setuptools` cares for this PEP. In particular, I don't want to use `pip` *because* it creates wheels for installation process. This step cripples your ability to properly install packages / discover their data or scripts after they have been installed. This format was created by idiots... So, what you are saying is that Flit will work with `pip`, but not with `setuptools`... well, I'll say: good luck, I don't need that kind of tool at all :/
I care

Ok, here's some feedback. This is a great looking resume as far as experience and education goes, but it's what I would probably call a long form resume. You see, recruiters from both Microsoft and Google get a metric ton of resume's like this every day. Again this is a great resume, but there are things you could do even better to make you stand out at first. There is a wonderful blog post at [https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/mis\_laboratory/2009/02/23/how-to-get-a-job-at-microsoft-part-ii-writing-an-awesome-resume/](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/mis_laboratory/2009/02/23/how-to-get-a-job-at-microsoft-part-ii-writing-an-awesome-resume/) that discusses it in detail. But basically * You want a 1 page resume to send in that includes the basics and not every single detail. This can come later when they want to learn more about you or more details. * You want a 10 word or so objective statement that says what exactly you are looking for like: "Looking for a job in software development as a programmer with n years of experience" where n is of course your number of years of experience. * If you have 2-3+ years of experience, put the work experience first. Keep it short, a basic summary no more than maybe 2 sentences about what you do/ did including the technologies/ languages used. * If you have less than 2-3+ years of experience, education should come first, state what location you graduated from, your thesis, and graduation date. Even if you didn't graduate yet, put in your expected graduation date, this helps it feel complete. * For your work experience there are multiple ways to format it, but stick to one. Usually job title is first, then company. followed by time you were at that job, a one sentence description of what you did, and a short 2-4 item list of relevant accomplishments. That's all I got time for atm, but read that blog post.

I'm new to python and only game I have made is Rock, Paper, Scissors. To restart the game I placed it within a 'while' loop. I use 'continue' if user wants to play again and 'break' if not. Is this possible for your game?
Alive = False 
If you happen to be using NX, it can natively script using python or VB and would definitely be able to do what you’re describing 
buildout is a fine option.
Yes. Our bot is faster than theirs already :)
No, and i am not planning to do so (yet). I dont think A* is really needed for starcraft, because you only very rarely get the to point you calculate the path to. Most of the times you just use the start of the path to get the direction and change your direction on your way anyways.
there's one already recommending freecad, the other recommended cad is solvespace.
Same for me! I'm starting with a few books. Hoping it all goes well for you!
Rhino is another interesting environment that can be scripted. For my PhD, I setup rhino as a restful server. I would send parameters in and some time later get a cad model back. Rhino isn't easy to use, bit it's also not impossible. I've thought about trying fusion360 to do the same thing, but haven't had time. 
It’s not that hard to make it pass on typing. A couple try excepts and you’re good. Mypy is still being run from stock python. It is one less thing though; kinda like dropping 2.7 support.
alternatively you can use off-the-shelf forum/ wiki/ bugtrack sites. gitlab, bitbucket and github provide most of them, just add static site and you're done imo 
This is better suited for r/learnpython.

Who controls the distribution of the terminal program? (Terminal not in the sense of "final", but a program that allows you to interact with the shell). If you are distributing it (i.e. you have your own terminal written, or you bundle some third-party one, like Mintty), then users would have no problems with you resizing the window, since they would treat it as part of your program. But, if your program doesn't come with its own terminal, then resizing the terminal is really up to the user. If they want / like command prompt window... then, I'm sorry for them, but that is their choice.
For comparison, Syncthing, with is a system of similar purpose, is 129 kLOC, of which 66 kLOC are Go, and 35 kLOC are Javacript. And since it's a peer-to-peer system, it includes both client and server part of the code, together with web-based GUI.

in docker you still have to install python packages somehow? why do it differently there? doesnt make sense. all `pyproject.toml` has done is create another standard in one file to kill all files. im sure youre aware of the competing standards xkcd. my gripe with all these is that all of them sasy they are the only tool youll need but then their maintainers refuse to add things which would make it a one go to tool

You are doing statistics / scientific programming; why are you applying to SRE? I've been through their recruitment process. They don't care that much about your scholarly achievements, but you need to be able to troubleshoot misbehaving DNS server or know how to hot-swap a disk in a RAID-6 system. At least that was my impression. If you really want *that* job, I suggest you put something that sounds more like ops / sysadmin stuff.
You use google, right?
When i write import winsound, it becomes like a comment. I dont know if you understand what i mean

Well I was approached by them for the same position! I did ask them whether this involves programming/building core google products or not to which I got a reply saying yes. Thanks for letting me know its almost the same typical SRE role that is at firm. I thought google might be different!

&gt; in docker you still have to install python packages [...] That's why I say "if you have something like web services/micro-services". If you are building web/TCP APIs that communicate with each other and their dependencies are defined at that level. But given your reaction, clearly, that's not the case, as I suspected hehe &gt; all `pyproject.toml` has done is create another standard [...] competing standards xkcd [...] I guess that depends on the point of view. Without new tools and ideas, we would still be building all these applications in C instead of Python, taking weeks to deploy in servers instead of containers, etc. Yes, it's a new file, a new idea, etc. That always comes with friction, and with a chance of failure. That's why I wanted to tell you that it has worked, at least for me. &gt; [...] they are the only tool youll need [...] Only Poetry claims to be "the only tool you'll need", it might be, I'm not using it that much. But `pyproject.toml` itself doesn't claim that, it only replaces, in certain cases, `setup.py`. Here's the important thing, taken from Pipenv's docs: &gt; Pipenv is primarily meant to provide users and developers of applications with an easy method to setup a working environment. For the distinction between libraries and applications and the usage of setup.py vs Pipfile to define dependencies, see ☤ [Pipfile vs setup.py](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/#pipfile-vs-setuppy). If you are building a library, or as I understand, a set of interdependent libraries, `pipenv` is probably not the tool for the job, and you should indeed move away from it. It never intended to be the tool for _that specific_ job. Now, about `setup.py` vs `pyproject.toml`: If you need to build binary extensions or are happy with `setup.py` files, parsing the main `README` by hand in code, handling package versions in the `setup.py` file and in your code (making sure you synchronize changes in both files), declaring specifically which other files to include, like assets, `LICENSE`, etc, managing `setup.cfg`, `MANIFEST.in`, and other additional needed files, using a different tool to publish your package like `twine`, etc. you should probably indeed stick to `setup.py` and family. I think the experience of creating a Python library with `setup.py` and family is not as intuitive and easy as I wished. With Flit and `pyproject.toml` it was, at least for me. Now, I'm not really affected by which tool you decide to use, but in my case, I like to see when other people have used the things I'm planning on using, and if that has worked for them or not. Just to avoid losing too much time. That's all I'm trying to do here. --- Now, I imagine these libraries we are talking about are not the only thing you will ever code in Python. I guess you have more Python projects on your computer. You probably need to set up virtual environments for them, with different dependencies, without mixing all those dependencies. And making sure you are not depending on a dependency that was not defined in your project but was in the global environment by chance. For that, you will need a virtual environment management tool. You can use `venv`, `virtualenv`, `pipenv`, `poetry` or maybe other. And then you need to declare which are the dependencies of each of those projects, in each environment, so that your teammates can also replicate your environment when helping you with the project. For that you can use `pip` with `requirements.txt`, `pipenv` with `Pipfile` or `poetry` with `pyproject.toml` (using the specific section not for distribution but for local development, as Poetry does).

I looked at the refactored code, it works perfectly! I would have never thought of using a PipeController as it’s own class. 
ML is a subset of AI. AI can cover a lot of ground, but I'm thinking the joke here is that "haha business people don't know programming." Except any data scientist worth their salt better be able to put their analysis in both implementation and presentation, where the former is a well thought-out, technical system, and the latter details their results and discoveries without needless technical jargon. Basically, no one cares about your ML algorithm if you as the programmer aren't able to put the "Intelligence" in AI where it counts.

Rewriting parts or Pretty\_Midi. Anyone have any recommendations for a better MIDI library for Python 3.x? Pretty\_Midi is nice because it provides several tools for extracting Chroma, as well as Piano Roll based on frames of user-set length by milliseconds. Which means that Midi files saved at different PPQ Resolutions can be interpreted in a uniform way here. But quantizing this data into beats and subdivisions of beats doesn't seem to be a built-in function in Pretty MIDI. 
&gt; Except any data scientist worth their salt better be able to put their analysis in both implementation and presentation You'd be surprised. I got a company bending over backwards trying to hire me for a job that's 50/50 sales/data analysis because they haven't been able to find an analyst with social skills willing to give presentations.
Thank you 🚀
For something this simple, you shouldn't even use a loop. It's more efficient to use map. `things = map(lambda x: 2*x, things)`
It uses logarithms or fights logarithms?
How else would you overwrite values using a loop? For-each loops traditionally do not allow mutation of the iteration variable. Here's an example: &gt;&gt;&gt; l = [1,2,3] &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in l: ... i += 1 ... &gt;&gt;&gt; l [1, 2, 3] &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(len(l)): ... l[i] += 1 ... &gt;&gt;&gt; l [2, 3, 4] So unless I'm understanding you incorrectly, indices as iteration variables are *indispensable* and virtually no general-purpose language on Earth omits them from their specification.
To be fair, the indices are necessary here because the function is mutating the list in-place. Obviously the more idiomatic way to do it is for position, value in enumerate(aList): aList[position] = 2 * value But it's easy to miss that the `enumerate` function exists or not realize how it can be used for this purpose.
Uses logarithms to fight the exponential increase in terrorism!
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar.
More Pythonic: `things = [thing*2 for thing in things]`
I don’t know if enumerate didn’t exist back then, but when I learned programming on Python 2, textbooks always used `range(len(list_))`
What forms of (useful) AI don't count as machine learning? Expert systems?
This wouldn't work because the original function is modifying the list in place. `map` will return a primed generator and have to be converted into a `list` in order to access the new values.

Whether you find it useful or not is irrelevant https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#Artificial_general_intelligence_research 
Right
A virtual environment is not something that's located in the filesystem; it's a state that the process in which your program is run may or may not be in. You can run the program twice from exactly the same filesystem location, and depending on what you do beforehand, it might run in a different virtual environment each time. When you create a virtual environment, a folder/directory is created which contains a copy of the Python interpreter, and whatever packages you install into the virtual environment. That folder stays on your computer even after you restart it, just as folders normally do. However, the folder itself is not the virtual environment; it's just the collection of programs and files that your system uses to run Python programs when it's in the virtual environment. Normally, when you run a Python program, your system will look for the Python interpreter in a folder specified by the PATH environment variable. By default this will be the folder you installed Python in, outside of your virtual environment. It doesn't matter where in the filesystem you run Python from. However, in the virtual environment folder, there is a script file located in the `Scripts` or `bin` folder (depending on whether you're on Windows or UNIX). When you run this script, various environment variables such as PATH will be changed for the current process so that the system will look for the Python interpreter and Python modules and packages in your virtual environment folder, rather than in the default folder. The resulting state of the process, with the modified environment variables, is what we call the virtual environment. You do have to re-activate the script every time you run your program, because environment variables are local to a particular process. However, the script doesn't need to do a lot of work---it's just changing some pointers rather than actually creating new files---so it works quickly.

Heh, only in academia is actual use irrelevant. &gt;Namely DeepMind with their success in Human Player Simulation &gt;for e.g AlphaGo made use of new concepts: &gt; &gt; Reinforcement learning to improve already trained networks &gt;with new data or &gt; Unsupervised learning, e.g by Generative adversarial &gt;network to get improved networks by competition. And these are all machine learning. I guess my question is what actual, demonstrated, working artificial intelligence doesn't count as machine learning? 
AI is just searching various data structures, machine learning is setting/tuning parameters. 
What do you mean by the first one? 
It's not about the official terminology, it's which words about people actually working in the field choose vs which are chosen by those who, for example, sell the end product. You don't say you do artificial intelligence while writing a neural net, you say you do machine learning.

In principle I agree. I'm wondering if this is as relevant when gunicorn is run behind nginx and not directly facing the internet.
There is a course in CS which called AI. At least in our university chart of this course was exactly what they would called AI. It was basically heuristic algorithms on graphs and trees , intelligent! agents and at the ends expert systems. AI is basically referred to classical AI. Where you were hard coding a program with heuristic search's. This was popular vision of AI before 90's.

Thanks for giving it a try! I haven't looked into referrals just yet. I'd like to flesh out the site a bit first.

It's hard to discuss what is or isn't AI because the general sentiment is that [AI is whatever hasn't been done yet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_effect). If you take an undergrad course on AI, you will likely learn about graph searching algorithms (BFS, DFS, A*, etc), logical inference (Prolog, first-order logic), Bayes' theorem, and decision trees (minimax). However, most armchair computer scientists will tell you that that's not AI.
**AI effect** The AI effect occurs when onlookers discount the behavior of an artificial intelligence program by arguing that it is not real intelligence. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

&gt; I get a 100% isolated env Hahaha. Nope. Docker doesn't get you 100% isolation. But, maybe it's good enough for what you need. &gt; I build all deps into my app container Seriously? All of them? And how do you do it? You aren't calling `setup.py install` by any chance? Since that would be cheating, again, since `setuptools` is just an alternative to `pip`, so it would be actually doing your packaging, and not you/Docker. Hint: Docker doesn't know how to package Python, and never will, it's just not intended to do that. You can either do it by hand, which is extremely tedious and error-prone, or you will be using some package manager, of which there are loads in Python, `pip` and `setuptools` being two most popular ones.

Definitely the latter... I might file an issue to later to ask if they're ever gonna implement decreasing entropy.
People are increasingly snooty about what qualifies as AI, to what I consider a ridiculous degree. Some people now claim that one of the hallmark moments of AI, IBM's Deep Blue, was not AI at all because it was "just an algorithm" (whatever that means). Chess programs? AI. Civilization computer opponents? AI. That Tic Tac Toe program you made when you first learned programming? Primitive AI. Machine learning specifically refers to algorithms that "learn" from data fed into them, as opposed to algorithms that are more hand-coded.
That's hot. That's hot.

Well ofc i use a package manager, but it is run inside the app container when first built, and cached for the rest of its lifetime. I use pip for this. Nothing on my OS can touch my container, so yes its isolated. Did you read the OPs post? I dont use pipenv because i dont need a virtual environment because i develop all my apps with docker. If i just want to run a small 5min proto then yes, i will create a throwaway virtualenv with pipenv. I build my deps to my container and mount the src. My app then uses other containers for some other deps, like postgres or redis. All is then managed with compose. Anyone on any OS can run compose up and have the exact dev env i have, including the database and caching layer etc etc. I dont really understand whats your issue with this setup? I find it super easy and takes lots of pain away dev environments. The best part is you can build your own base images, and fork others. My base images are all using alpine, so they are 5mb in size. Thats just amazing.

&gt; Well ofc i use a package manager So, this is what manages your environment. Docker has nothing to do with it. &gt; Nothing on my OS can touch my container You are so naive... but I'm afraid, this would be too technical for ya :) &gt; If i just want to run a small 5min proto then yes, i will create a throwaway virtualenv with pipenv. Oh, lol, 5 minutes? `pipenv` won't even start in 5 minutes. Why would you use `pipenv` to create a virtual environment, if there are better tools for that, which are built into Python? &gt; I dont really understand whats your issue with this setup? A lot of stupid people believe that Docker can be used for packaging and distributing their applications, and then point their fingers at `pip` or `setuptools` drooling and shouting: "it's water from the toilet!". What Docker gives you in terms of Python development is a huge overkill on one hand, and severe restrictions on another hand. So, considering cons and pros, you would be better off using `venv`. The later isn't perfect, but the amount of pain you would have to go through in order to debug your running application is just not worth it, when it comes to Docker: you can only debug, if you are on Linux, really, because then you would be able to see the processes running in your container, but then you have a clusterfuck of libraries installed in your container and outside. You would have very hard time figuring out how much memory your application uses and where does that memory go. Even having your host as Linux won't help you because of the holes in Linux / Docker cooperation (i.e. for example `free` in Docker container shows nonsense, and you need to know how to find your actual memory stats in `/sys/fs/...`). All I/O that goes to the disk is essentially botched by Docker, you cannot really do that in production, but if you are testing in Docker... well, you'd simply not have any idea of how it will really work. More or less the same goes for networking and other stuff that has to deal with devices. And you plunge into that mess only because you drank koolaid story telling you how Docker is an answer to every question. &gt; My base images are all using alpine, so they are 5mb in size. Your base image using a severely lacking in every respect is *only* 5 MB in size, while your virtual environment, which has access to everything you have on your host system is a *whooping* couple dozens KB! What a steal!

I was calling then voxels before i got that slapped out of me. Thank you. One thing that us elluding me is how to define each individually as i am only doing somw basic 2d array stuff. Just got to keep telling myself i am not there yet.
This slide makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. 
It's not that egregious, though it could be simplified. def double(l): for i in range(len(l)): l[i] *= 2 And shrunk: def double(l): l[:] = (2 * i for i in l) It's the in-place mutation that's forcing the indexing (and slicing). Of course you can try and make it look _more_ C-ish if you want: def double2(l: int) -&gt; int: i: int = 0; while i &lt; len(l): l[i] &lt;&lt;= 1; i += 1; Fun times.
They used to say, "If it works, it's not AI." That was referring to things like expert systems.
There's nothing "less" Pythonic about **map** and **lambda**. Also slicing to the rescue: things[:] = (thing*2 for thing in things) Et voila. 
I guess you could try flicking them an email asking for an exemption? You could base it on the fact that you’re trying to prepare your students for the work environment - using professional development tools such as PyCharm (and that includes interacting with databases, using integrated debugging tools and so on) as they’re highly likely used in professional settings. It’d be in JetBrains best interest, as getting students used to a software product whilst they’re young is likely to lead to extended use in the long term (I can only speak of this anecdotally though). The worst they can do is say ‘no’ I guess. Best of luck!
Your idea seems a lot like cellular automata. [Golly](http://golly.sourceforge.net) is free and open source; you can use it to explore existing rule-sets or test out your own. (Ever heard of [The Sandbox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandbox_(video_game))? The original was just a sophisticated cellular automaton.)
This is my first time learning a language. I'm going to try and combine what I want to learn about by attempting to make a foreign exchange database for the 2018 year.
well, in a talk Raymond Hettinger gave he said something to the effect of 'python is laid out so that you rarely have to manipulate indices, so if you do a lot of index manipulation,you're likely doing it wrong' in that spirit, this is my solution: def double(a\_list): a\_list = \[ k\*2 for k in a\_list\] imo, my list comprehension looks a lot prettier and more readable than anything involving indices. &amp;#x200B;
Machine learning can be used as a tool in different artificially intelligent systems - they're not completely independent and often there is a synergistic effect. An example of an AI system which doesn't have to use any ML might be argumentation. Argumentation has been demonstrably beneficial in legal and medical domains, where the AI systems can provide arguments to lawyers and physicians about the best course of action or treatment to take. It essentially works on graph mutations but is able to reason about stylised facts and observations in a manner which makes it intelligent. Argumentation is an example of what I would call 'Model-based AI' as opposed to 'Data-driven AI' of which ML would principally belong. I have heard from different sources that Model-based AI, Data-driven AI, machine learning, deep learning, planning, reasoning aren't 'real'/'true' AI. But the issue is one of terminology, often general artificial intelligence is referred to just as AI; often machine learning and deep learning are used interchangeably; and autonomy has very different meanings depending if you are the builder or user of software agents. I think we ultimately need to work out what intelligence is; what makes us intelligent agents worthy of moral status; and what (if any) differences there are between a (perfectly deterministic) human brain and a computer. Then we can work out exactly what is and isn't AI. 😅
But it did not accomplish the same task. You're taking the original **a_list** and assigning a new list to the same name. The original code (and mine) _mutate_ the existing list in memory. If you `print(id(a_list))` on either side of the mutating versions you'll find that it's the same value, on yours it is not. So yes, it's prettier, but it's not doing the same work. And Hettinger was right, but _likely_ is not the same thing as _always_.
What about implementing ml in PowerPoint? I mean, [it's turing complete...](https://youtu.be/uNjxe8ShM-8)
This is not really any more idiomatic; in fact I'd argue for a mutating overwrite the code OP posted is the idiomatic form; the only thing the original author didn't do right was skip using `a_list[index] *= 2` to save the double index lookup. Sure back in the days of Python 2 **enumerate** would have been more efficient than **range**, but that's what **xrange** existed to solve.
How can this post have so many upvotes...

Symbolic AI is a big field and doesn't including ML (that falls under subsymbolic AI)
I encourage you to try running the code you posted originally, running again with your solution and then compare the results.
It's been around since 2.3, so quite a while. The `range(len(list_))` was improved by **enumerate** because if you were mutating a 10M item list you first had to allocate and fill a list of 10M indexes before you even began iterating. The **enumerate** function returns a generator, so it allowed you to visit each in turn and never generate that list. Huge improvement. But `xrange(len(list_))` avoided that side effect as well. In Python 3 it's never an issue; use **enumerate** if you need to manipulate the value in some way that can't be done with augmented assignment... use **range** if it can be done with augmented assignment.
Was I that off?

That's interesting, never thought about it this way.
you don't want to do that.
The choice of either of them will have minimal impact on the amount of contributors you get to your project. There are way too many other contributing factors for you to even think about the framework making a difference here.

I’m a newbie. I just finished a simple command line calculator to determine how much my taxes would increase if I moved to California. And compared my tax changes if my soon-to-be wife and I filed our taxes separately or jointly. It’s not much but it was fun.

I don't like to mutate like this. For clarity I'd prefer to return a new iterable and leave the old one unchanged. I understand it's less performant, but I don't worry too much about that at this stage; it can be fixed later (if necessary) after profiling. def double_sequence(items : List[int]) -&gt; List[int] return [item * 2 for item in items] seq = [2, 5, 5] seq_doubled = double_sequence(seq)

Do it, you’ll make way more money. 
HMM's for example 
Since a power point is unstructured data, can’t you just use computer vision to read this data and AI to create the next slide?
I highly recommend this talk. I just re wrote one of my old programs today based on this advice. It's a little hard to wrap your head around the concepts (I personally find), but it is great for making your code reusable. 
It’s also saying that if you just make a PowerPoint, your intelligence is artificial... aka you’re dumb and/or don’t know what you’re talking about 
I created a very basic prototype of a shell that uses Python as its base language with some special syntax to call down into the system and process what you get back. It's fully functional with a couple bugs, but very barebones.
The official Flask tutorial discusses structure: [http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/)
Nginx doesn't protect against vulnerabilities in your code, which runs under admin. If you have a function that returns the os.environ dict, there is nothing Nginx can do to prevent this. 
It's not completely wrong, but it's not really a correct distinction. Artificial Intelligence is a catch-all for computers and programs doing things that seem intelligent. This covers things such as machine learning, pathfinding, robots, recommendation systems, autonomous cars, chess bots. One of the most well known books on AI (AI: A Modern Approach) defines AI as "the study of agents that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions".
Yeah I was thinking about it. I have an interview for a job I want more on Friday so I'm going to see how that plays out first
What kind of solver are you using? Finite elements? Take a look at IsoGeometric Analysis (IGA) for bridging the gaps between geometry and simulations. 
What is the desired result? I’d be interested in seeing where the original example came from. As has been said before, this is not the same thing. You’re creating a new list and dereferencing the old one. This is very different to what you posted originally and has significant implications for memory management, IPC and many other things. What you posted originally also was inside a function, but here you’re writing it imperatively. What if you want to replicate the same behavior on different lists? That’s why it’s a function in the first place. If you think it’s unpythonic then you should look at `list.sort()`, it also works on lists in-place. It’s **extremely** important to understand the concept of mutable data structures. With the little context I have this looks like it’s an example that was made to drive this very point.
Yeah, xrange was what I meant. It’s been quite a while since I’ve used Python 2.
it impresses me that you can code, but not know how to make a screenshot :P
Hahaha shiiit, that would have much less blurry.. I took the picture like 3 times on my rubbish phone too because it was unreadable :|.

I don’t like that solution because it’s not simple or readable. Unless we’re playing code golf I’d prefer the two liner. Readability counts. It’s pretty hard to “prove” that something is unpythonic, it’s simply something that the community has decided that is and you won’t see much people using map. I can show you that map is blacklisted by default in [PyLint](http://pylint-messages.wikidot.com/messages:w0141). The rationale from [PEP 202](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0202/): &gt; List comprehensions provide a more concise way to create lists in situations where map() and filter() and/or nested loops would currently be used. Guido’s [regrets](https://legacy.python.org/doc/essays/ppt/regrets/PythonRegrets.ppt) &gt; List comprehensions do the same thing better. Or his opinion in [this blog post](http://python-history.blogspot.com/2010/06/from-list-comprehensions-to-generator.html?m=1) &gt; I find the list comprehension notation much easier to read than the functional notation
It is more idiomatic. For example [Effective Python](https://effectivepython.com/) on Chapter 1 (Pythonic thinking) includes the rule "Prefer enumerate Over range".

We had a tough time with pipenv and poetry using container-based workflow. poetry seemed very promising and I want to give it another shot down the road, but getting rid of setuptools eliminate our availability to use pbr for versioning. Pipenv's container workflow seemed a bit strange and it didn't seem to add that much value in our case. Eventually, we just ended up using pip-tools which has worked well for us.

/r/learnpython is probably more suitable for that question
Didn't know that was there. Thanks. I will relocate.
Getting rid of setuptools is a positive because of all it complexities and the insanity of it's API, but at the same time so many things are based on it. You lose pbr which is just so nice for sane git-based versioning.
Nice. It looks a bit too dark (hard to see what is going on), but that is probably because of the black spacing.
Just saw this. It would be awesome to see your code!

I have not heard of one. How about [winpython](http://winpython.github.io/)? It's a version of python that you install and run from a thumbdrive.

What are your thoughts on this one https://youtu.be/ZGER9N0iPNk It’s the first copy I did with the ascii art reversed. I didn’t like how it treated the higher brightness pixels. 
Which ide are you using ?
Next challenge: do the same in one line of code! Like with list comprehension and fancy (but unreadable) stuff!
Looks like VSCode to me
Is it possible to also use the value to control the brightness of the character for a more pronounced 3D effect? (I am learning too.)
I've not used it but see there is a django-graphene package which will give you graphql : [https://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/django/en/latest/](https://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/django/en/latest/) and if what you're building is more like an API than an application then flask is a good choice. But potentially so is something like [starlette.io](https://www.starlette.io/) which builds on asyncio and has database and graphql support. It's much newer than flask though so there will be fewer tutorials, stack overflow posts etc to reference.
Yeah, that's gonna be a no for me dawg.
The .vscode folder is a dead giveaway.
To each their own. :)
DRF is especially good for people who don't know good API design like me a couple years ago. Made an absolute mess of a flask api, while DRF has so much extra and enforces a decent structure on your api. 
Technically, this sub is the one where discussion of the python language, interesting libraries etc. happen. /r/learnpython is the one where people should be asking questions relating to learning the language. But nobody reads the sidebar. I, personally, am in favour of an automod which detects question-like posts (on a hair trigger) and removes them, with a message recommending /r/learnpython, and an option to automatically reinstate the post. I left /r/learnpython because I had had enough of low-effort "do my homework" posts and people stubbornly refusing to provide enough information to actually get any help, but the questions here are the majority of posts *and* probably even lower-quality because you know for certain that anyone posting a question here hasn't taken 10 seconds to read the sidebar.
Very cool! Doing fractals like that could be a cool project. I bet if you looked at the math behind some fractal geometry you could do something beautiful with just a few lines of code

Really neat, I love just to know there is people out there still learning. Also, I would recommend trying to program some sorting algorithms; they are quite fun to work with. All in all , keep up the great work.
Azure/Google Cloud offer online Jupyter Notebooks 
Try pip-tools, flit, and make yourself [some practical aliases](https://github.com/AndydeCleyre/dotfiles/blob/master/.python.zshrc). You'll still have to maintain the two types of dependencies: those for PyPI distribution, and those more strictly defined ones for development/testing.
In my opinion, you don't need a special framework for a map-based web application. Use Python flask/hug/falcon/etc to create a backend &amp; API which gives you the data you need and use node &amp; openlayers or leaflet to write your frontend.

A help queue for the TA lab I work in so students can electronically submit a request for a TA to come help them and the TA can get their name and question and go help. Much better than the current "Write your name on the whiteboard and pray there's space" system we currently have! Sometimes it's so hard to tell where the next person on the list is!
I have never had issues you describe. If you say docker wont provide enough isolation, you also know that a traditional venv wont either. How does pip manage my env? It simply installs packages to a dir? It has nothing to do with the env. And using alpine is lacking? When using is as a base, its just python, like a service. Sure its lacking, its not even bundled with bash! Thats the point! It does not need anything. Why do i need a full OS with say Perl and PHP pre installed when i develop a simple python rest api?

Okay, you're one of today's [lucky 10000](https://xkcd.com/1053/) To take a screenshot in windows, press PrntScrn button on your keyboard. This copies the current contents of the screen to the clipboard as an image. Open MS Paint, paste, save. On linux, since it looks like that might be linux, PrntScrn is usually bound to a screenshot utility that will do ever better than windows. Using KDE, for example, you'll get either KSnapShot or Spectacle popping up. It'll give you options on how you want to capture your screen, where to save the image, etc. 
Or use snippet app on windows. 
It's a correct distinction in the context of the post. Did you miss the joke, and the question the original commenter asked?
&gt;AI is a result of machine learning Yeah as others have said, that's not really correct. Artificial Intelligence is a broad field, covering pretty much any system which autonomously makes "intelligent" decisions. Programs and algorithms can actually do this surprisingly well in complex domains without having to "learn" (ie: store data on results of decisions and use analysis of that data to make better decisions in future). I did an AI course at university last semester. It was a third year course, but was essentially introductory as far as the topic is concerned. For our final project I implemented a program using Monte Carlo Tree Search to get a "racing team" from one end of a "track" to the other. The track was essentially a 1-D array where each cell could have any of 3 binary options for terrain properties (hilly or flat, straight or slalom, dirt or asphalt), and the team could at any point choose to continue driving, refuel, change driver, change car, change tires, change tire pressure. Each combination of all these states had a particular effect on the chances of the team breaking down or slipping (hence losing a number of turns) or moving a number of cells forward or backwards or remaining in place. Now the Monte Carlo Tree Search is essentially an 'online' method, meaning it pauses to explore it's options at each state, and then decides what action to take, as opposed to an 'offline' method, meaning you examine every possible states and develop a complete mapping from each state to some action, and then charge ahead. MCTS is a surprisingly simple algorithm. You pretty much just tinker around with your reward function, plug it into this algo which essentially makes random actions from the current state and automatically balances exploring actions not yet tried with exploiting ones which have achieved good rewards, using the results to give weight to each possible action, until it hits a predetermined number of iterations or amount of time expires, then it goes ahead and chooses the best weighted action that it determined in that time. And it was like fucking black magic. You feed in all the probability functions, muck around with the reward function a bit, and suddenly away it goes, refuelling when it needs to, changing tires when the next few cells' terrain aren't going to work well for the current tires, and charging straight ahead when close to the finish line. But the thing is, once it executes each action, all the stuff it figured out about what to do from the previous state is thrown away. So you could say it is learning something while in each state, but since that knowledge is always thrown away as soon as it acts, it really doesn't qualify as a system that learns, yet it certainly appears to behave very intelligently. Furthermore, this algorithm is reasonably cutting edge. It was really only properly defined about fifteen years ago, and *all* the current best game-playing AIs use it, though they do use proper 'learning' as well. So the point is, there is plenty of scope and legitimacy for CS researchers to be improving artificial intelligence which doesn't necessarily learn a single thing. In practice though, combining any such advances with learning systems is definitely the way to go.
it wants you to go and learn C++
Because `insert()` returns `None`. The correct list is actually constructed, but then you throw it away.
Sure, and look at how old all of those are. In more recent years with the rise of FRP and languages like Elm and Elixir and Rust the functional aspects of Python once considered outdated start to look prescient, useful, and Pythonic once more. For a great many data pipelining tasks it's simply shorter to **map** and **filter**: map(int, ints) (int(i) for i in ints) filter(bool, map(int, ints)) (i for i in (int(i) for i in ints) if i) I've been doing this for a while and I used to make the same appeals to authority, but "Pythonic" isn't so fixed an idea that one should rigidly assume that it also means "best for every possible task at hand"... all those quotes are about creating **lists**, and yes a list comprehension beats a **map** wrapped in a **list** for clarity, but when you're never actually building the list until you consume a pipeline of iterators/generators and _especially_ when working in functional mode then any tool in the language can become the Pythonic approach.

There are a number of ways to go about this. Either by interfacing with the program or by editing the files directly. One you might want to check out is openscad it’s not based on a GUI modeler but rather you “code” the primaries so changing them while iterating over analysis. There are python bindings. Just search openscad and python. 
Excel is difficult and resource intensive to read and write from. I have an app that performed a lot of data analysis and the slowest part of the application is just writing excel files. Probably the easiest would be the just save the excel sheet as a CSV file and read that into pandas. It still won’t be instantaneous but it will be faster without the overhead. You will probably want to set the low_memory flag in the read_csv command.

Again with the appeal to authority... it's "Prefer" not "Use only". It's contrived, but this: def sum_positions(string): return sum(i for i, _ in enumerate(string)) Is not somehow _necessarily_ or _obviously_ preferable to this: def sum_positions(string): return sum(range(len(string))) If the task at hand _requires_ the indices but _not_ the values being indexed over, then **range** is the "one [...] obvious way to do it". This is _especially_ true if you for some reason wanted every third index from some initial offset. def double_every_third_from_2(a_list): for i in range(2, len(a_list), 3): a_list[i] *= 2 Vs: def double_every_third_from_2(a_list): for i, _ in enumerate(a_list): if i &lt; 2 or (i - 2) % 3: continue a_list[i] *= 2 When indexing is the right tool for the job, indexing _is_ Pythonic, and the same is true for **range**,

haha, I think we did the same AI course. UQ?
An internship? Sure. If you concentrate very hard and focus on basic skills and scripting tasks. Plenty of companies are happy to give a summer internship to a student who is keen and knows the basics. For instance if you can complete every exercise in the Python track of [exercism](http://exercism.io) you'll find many companies that would offer an unpaid internship. Even more so if you can write some basic command line tools that, for instance, walks a directory tree and finds files whose name match a simple pattern.
Would also not that Excel files are essentially zipped so the real size of the file is likely to be much larger than that once unzipped. 
Wow, yep! Admin was pretty much a clusterfuck, but the content was cool :)
Yes, Poetry needs a virtualenv to work and creates one for your project (unless you tell it not to). But that's just something required by the Python ecosystem that Poetry does under the hood but only because there is no other way at the moment but Poetry is not an environment manager, using virtualenvs is just an implementation detail. &amp;#x200B; No other package manager that I know of supports \`.env\` files. This is the job for other tools.
Actually the hardest thing, al least for my country, is to find the company that works with Python. I recommend you to not only send your resume to companies that are actively hiring people, but also to companies that just work with Python. Often they don’t really need an intern, but don’t ming if somebody interested will work with them. Good luck.

As I've said [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9yyiuv/meta_can_we_stop_answering_questions_here_drop_a/ea562cs/), this sub should become THE beginner questions sub if only because it's the logical first place to look.

No, I think. As the list is mutable object， the '''insert''' method would change the object and don't return anything.
Good job! Looks very interesting, but did you try click library? [https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/) It is also declarative-style CLI tool, but based on decorators not annotations
Also [http://docopt.org/](http://docopt.org/) is qute good library. Principle is: write doc string only and docopt will derieve parameters, flags and so on from it. For me it is a best choice for small scripts (&lt;10 parameters)

Thank you very much for these examples. my python experience is almost nonexistent but I am willing to learn. What I intend to do is a web app to control a homemade thermostat. I will be processing temperature readings from a number of temperature sensors and display the temperature for each in a graph. Also I want to have some buttons that will increase or decrease some temperature values to control the thresholds that trigger some events. Can I create buttons with flask?
thank you I will look into it!
Yep, once I figured out the situation I got in touch with them, still waiting on a reply. I can only ask
 import subprocess as su pr = su.Popen(["strace", "-p", "32100"], stdout=su.PIPE, stderr=su.PIPE) while True: line = pr.stderr.readline() print(line) This code just works. I think the main problem you have - you try to read stdout, but it looks like strace write to stderr.
Thanks, that solved it
Popen doesn't suck. It's just low-level api which provides variety of functionality: * run process * read stdout/stderr continuously * wait process and get returncode * don't wait process but communicate with it * piping processes And so on. For details of Popen best practicies I'd recommend to read Effective Python by Brett Slatkin.

Anyone ever uses Gyazo or that shit anymore? Lol. That’s what I used to use for screenshots waaaaay back during the Age of Binbows. 
I used Django and WSGI (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/howto/deployment/wsgi/)... it took me some time until I got all the dependencies right using my own vserver. It seems to me that Django is more focused on rapid prototyping, not for deployment of a real application (of course that's fine but if you want to host an app quickly, it can become a bit messy).
Yeah, you're right.
Great, thanks!
The author is a noob / doesn't understand what he's talking about. The article is full of nonsense / misleading information.
I'm working on [results](https://github.com/australianunions/results), a library for working with databases with less boilerplate.
In cpython, and maybe other pythons, all python source code is compiled to byte code which is then interpreted.
@crabbone hello and I'm sorry you feel so, care to go in details and enlist a few of these? thank you!
I'm not sure I follow. If you're just trying to get django going on wsgi with your own server, I highly suggest something like nginx in front of uwsgi. Something like this: https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/Django_and_nginx.html I'm not sure there are many systems that are easier to deploy except for ones using a service like Firebase. What systems have you used in the past that you feel are much better for deployment?
"Mostly won't get it" is an insufferably smug thing to tag on to what is already an uniformed and shite joke
&gt; If you say docker wont provide enough isolation, you also know that a traditional venv wont either. Dud... do you even?.. I just wrote that isolation in Docker is better, just fucking read it... I said that it's better but not 100% as you insinuated. I also said, that in some simple cases, the level of isolation will not really matter to you, because you aren't doing anything that would require it. I also said that this better isolation is a huge price to pay for something you don't need. &gt; Why do i need a full OS with say Perl and PHP pre installed when i develop a simple python rest api? Because your simple Python REST API doesn't know how to do everything in Python. Or it will suck too much, if done only in Python. Do you need a decent HTTP server, or are you going to use `import http`? If the later, your HTTP server will suck so much, it won't be usable even for a single user, not to mention putting it in a production environment, where you might have, god forbid two users, or maybe even three! So, you need a decent server, like `httpd`, `ngnix`, `gunicorn` etc. How do you get one? Well, it is typically written in C. How do you get a program written in C to run? Well, you compile it. Maybe, in order to compile it, you will need a Perl script, or maybe even PHP, I don't know, but I'd just not restrict myself to Python only in my *development* environment because it's just stupid and takes away a lot of my time.
This is not helpful at all, even less so without actually listing any specific concerns. The experience of the author indicates the opposite: &gt;On my path to understand better this black box and try to improve it I've became the maintainer of both the virtualenv and tox project, with occasionally contributing to both setuptools and pip. 
Seems like trolling. Don't be discouraged by toxic comments like that!
The recommendation to use `wheel` alone deserves a dunce hat. That's just stupid. The best format... well, scratch that. There aren't any good or even tolerable formats for distributing Python code. Every attempt to write one so far has failed. So, let me rephrase it: the format that sucks least is compressed TAR archive with sources. Wheel sucks because it doesn't allow you to put your data files and scripts where you need them to be and later you will not know where your files ended up being stored. It doesn't allow you to do anything at installation time beside copying sources, whereas even that is not up to you really, and even if you know about bugs in `pip` or `setuptools`, you can do nothing to prevent them. Wheels are bloated with useless / unnecessary information. Even worse, there are multiple failures in Python packaging, like namespace packages, "distribution packages" containing multiple "installation packages", whereas depending on your toolchain versions they will do all sorts of unpredictable things. Oh, wait, every heard about `*.pth` files? But, ultimately, Python doesn't have a format for deployment / installation of programs. So, if you actually need to install your program, and not spend hours at your friend's computer setting up development tools and trying to understand why your `setup.py` / `requirements.txt` / `project.toml` don't work on their computer. Because if you want to package your program for distribution, you'll end up hand-coding a DEB / an RPM / an MSI or something even more custom-tailored. Even the simplest of tasks, like installing a program composed of multiple packages is impossible with existing Python tools. Your example project uses `tox.ini`, `twine` -- this would make any sane person vomit. Fashion programming at its finest. Use more useless tools just to appear in vogue. Your installation scheme is idiotic / feeds into the public idiocy by using both `setuptools` and `pip` in the same workflow. No. Don't use `pip`. Pip is garbage. If you can avoid it, and you can (you already use `setuptools`), use `setuptools`, it's lesser evil (also bad, but not as bad), even if you don't believe me, at least the argument that if you absolutely must use `setuptools`, and you can do everything using `setuptools`, why use an extra component? Also, the most common way for people to work with Python is *not* to upload it to pypi.org. Most people will have their packages in either their Git repositories, or their private package servers, not pypi.org. This is not all, I just don't have time to make this more organized / cover more ground.
This project that I wrote on a rainy Sunday afternoon. Useless but good fun. https://faithinhumanityscore.com
Snipping tool now has timer delays.
The thing about AI wasn't my own words, it's how I interpreted what was supposed to be the joke.
I see. I just would like to point out that setuptools itself is deprecating the upload command, so twine is the safer/saner tool to use if you ever need to upload a package to something that relies upon PyPi. In case you prefer to not go down that path though, and prefer using your operating systems package manager, that's perfectly fine. Note though, that going down that path means you'll need to repackage your application for every OS separately. In the meantime people who do want cross-platform compatible packaging and installation can happily use pip/setuptools/poetry/flit/twine/wheels and so on. Diversity is good for us here, and this includes accepting that some people just don't want/need this. Thanks for sharing your thoughts :-)
Have a look at [Repl.it](https://Repl.it) I've just checked and you can load Pandas from PyPI in a Python REPL.

Don't agree at all and don't think it's a good article
Your CV is not consistent with your [github.io](https://github.io) page, which i think is flaky.

I would maybe condense a lot of your things trying to extract the most important parts and boil it down to 1 page.

I feel your pain. I always wince when people make a python packaging tutorial in terms of "how to distribute a pure python package". Distributing pure python packages is trivial and has been for decades. At least this article states from the outset it is ignoring the common/hard/useful cases (dealing with compiled extensions, libraries, package-data and OS-specific packagers). Frankly, *conda* is the only packaging system that's anywhere close to being a good solution. Even then, it's not the conda package format that's useful so much as the conda environments. Wheels don't address package deployment at all. Wheels are for installing a binary package into an existing development environment. But if I have an existing development environment, I might as well build it myself. Wheels save me a few minutes compilation at best. Setuptools and easy\_install while flawed, was a pragmatic solution that nearly got there but got nerfed by the lack of proper specifications. Eggs were a great idea (not surprisingly, inspired by java jars) for library deployment. pip might have actually been useful for creating deployable software if the developers of virtual-envs had insistent they be portable. Ideally, someone needs to write some detailed documentation spelling out that the correct way to distribute python *software* (not a python library but an end-application) is to distribute your own python VM + libraries together and *don't ever rely on a system-wide python install.* It's taken me a decade to learn this lesson. Sorry, didn't mean to rant.
*Woah!* It's your **7th Cakeday** robin-gvx! ^(hug)
Well you could atleast posted a link to the video and not just a freaking printscreen xD
Sharing culture and knowledge is not a sin. Torturing the English language, on the other hand...
Compressed and generalized code: x=9 for i in range(1,2*x): print(((x-i) if i &lt; x else (i-x))*" ",end="") _i = (i if i &lt; x else 2*x-i) print(" "+" ".join([str(j+1) if j &lt; _i-1 else str(2*_i-j-1) for j in range(2*_i-1)])) Output: 1 1 2 1 1 2 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 2 1 1 2 1 1 For x=5 1 1 2 1 1 2 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 2 1 1 2 1 1 does not work for x &gt; 9
If `setuptools` will remove `upload` command, I'll just copy it verbatim from the last available version into my `setup.py` and will to with that. I don't want multiple useless dependencies: I work in infra/automation, and all they do is multiplying pain and extra work. &gt; mainly because doing thins over HTTP is very unsafe There is no problem with that. Learn to use GPG instead of repeating cliches from people who didn't manage to learn their tools. You don't need to secure the traffic, you need to secure the data. &gt; Note though, that going down that path means you'll need to repackage your application for every OS separately. What are you even talking about? There is no way to package Python application in an OS-independent way. Maybe if all you have is a hello-world program, and your user just so happened to have the correct version of Python installed, you'll be lucky it will run. In most cases what you need is to write OS-dependent code, and lots of it. You just probably never done anything more complicated than a hello world, which means you are in no position to advise anyone on how to do this.

i got it downloaded also, ill pay for a physical copy asap. its really a great book. 
What IDE?
Nice job!

Thanks for sharing i am looking into learning Python in the up coming months. What other resources would you recommend for a person that has absolutely no programming experience what so ever. 
Nice...I'm started with C++ Primer (5th edition)
Ty very much :&gt;
Which Korea u from?
Haha thanks man, I've recently moved to linux and havent completely got my head round everything yet. I've found a screenshot app now for my distribution, after researching, but thanks for being a cool dude.
Ok thank you.

Wow nice dude, thats a really nice way of doing it.
So, what exactly you do not agree with?
Python is not Go. Use Go if you like this style of error handling. But it doesn’t fit the style of Python. But really, this isn’t an anti pattern. Errors are supposed to happen, wrapping everything that could raise an error in a `try` `except` Block is the real anti pattern. In your first example you are catching an exception that serves a valid purpose: Division by zero shouldn’t be allowed and is most likely not intentional. So what do you want to happen if the function is called with these parameters? Right, you want the user to know that there was an exception and what went wrong. The exception that is raised does that.
I can recommend 2 free source, depend on what do you prefer. 1. [https://automatetheboringstuff.com](https://automatetheboringstuff.com) \- Contains practical use, like sending email, manipulating image. 2. [http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/](http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/) \- Contains material like Learning Python, but it is free [Python.org](https://Python.org) also giving some [recommendation](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers) and [tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) for beginner - You choose. If you already know python, you can dive to the [library references](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html). &amp;#x200B; Note: If you are new always use python 3. Leave if the tutorial still using python 2 for reference, except you learn for maintaining legacy / old projects
Exceptions are no anti pattern; wrapping everything in try except is not what you want to do. Python is fast to code and extremely dynamic - I doubt that Rust Style Error handling is the way to go
If it's written in Adobe Illustrator, it's definitely `.ai`
what is that [*range(), *reversed()] called? what do the * do? 
Good luck going down that path 😀 note though that both tox are truly cross platform and cross interpreter (cpython/pypy/jython) given the constraint of currently maintained versions, so I've think I've done enough to be in position to give advice. Would be interested to see if you've done enough to refute all this. All the best!
why do you end your print statement with end="" ? and what does the underline before the i do? 
Again, you simply have no experience / just drank too much koolaid to say any of that. If you work on a serious project for a few years, you'll see all you wrote as being just a load of marketing nonsense / fashion programming.
It's tuple unpacking! See: https://treyhunner.com/2018/10/asterisks-in-python-what-they-are-and-how-to-use-them/
I think it's worth separating the problem of library distribution from application distribution. They have different requirements and different solutions adequate to it. I find your points are perfectly valid for application deployment. It's still an unsolved problem and we invite your thougths, proposals and initial implementations for solving it.
&gt; wrapping everything in try except is not what you want to do Not everything. There are use-cases and limitations. &gt; I doubt that Rust Style Error handling is the way to go for python Either monad is used in many languages, not just Rust. And it works pretty well in Ruby, Php, Kotlin. So, why Python is an exception and should not have it?
Well I'm impressed
Just download ShareX, great screen capturing software, video and screenshots. 
Exceptions work well in Java and C#, why should they be bad in python ;) also afaik PHP uses exceptions too.
You end your print statement with end="" because by default, print() will output a new line after each value. That's how you get the numbers in a row using the loop. I'm not sure about the underscore.
&gt;because they haven't been able to find an analyst with social skills willing to give presentations Holy moly, that is pretty depressing lol; it is true in my experience that good technical \*and\* social/people skills can get you very far in this industry. Whereabouts do you live out of curiosity?
Basically what I'm looking for. Does this exist?
There area a couple sales folk at my company that refer to it simply as “science”
Look how far we've come. 
If you're looping the same exact data/range multiple times, there's almost certainly a way to combine the loops which will make your code more readable and much faster.
Yes, but this is not what the question author was looking for and I didn't want to get into the weeds and confuse the issue. 
Java has checked/unchecked exceptions mechanism. Which is the whole different thing. You may check https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/csharpfaq/2004/03/12/why-doesnt-c-have-checked-exceptions/ to read more about this debate. You can also have a look at: `dry-rb/dry-monads`, `php-functional`, other similar projects that solve the same problem.

United States in the southeast, North Carolina. I think another part of them having a hard time is I get the vibe it's a 50-60 hour a week type job with 30-40% travel. I'm at my first job right now and the contract expires in May and due to the lack of funding (i work at the EPA) I doubt it'll be renewed. I'm not super good at presentations and I've never worked sales but I figure my next job will be where my career goes, so I'm probably going to have to pick up a new skill set anyways.

I've read so many of those Reilly books and they are all super dull and sometimes hard to follow. Best python book I came across is this Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming https://www.amazon.com/dp/1593276036/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_OByyCbMTJD8GC

cool stuff. not sure type safety is necessary in python.
You can definitely do this with a Flask app, and I reckon Flask is a good choice. For producing graphs to render in HTML I'd look at Bokeh. You can put buttons into the webpage that sends signals to flask, that flask then passes on to your micro controller or whatever.

[/r/advancedpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/advancedpython) has been suggested for this, but hasn't gotten much traction yet.
Damn, didn't even know they were working on 3.6! A step in the right direction. Honestly they should stop wasting manpower on 2.7, though.
I learned Pygame mostly through messing with other people's code and messing with stuff to see what it did. I learned the rest from the official documentation. (https://www.pygame.org/docs/)
If you don't want to pirate, the first Python book I read and course I took was [Python For Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/). The digital version of the book is free and the paper version is inexpensive. The course is free unless you want a certificate on Coursera (where I took it) or edX. The author of that material is working on [Django for Everybody](https://dj4e.com/) and even though I work on Django now I'm looking forward to seeing the materials to see if I learn anything.
Coz, why not? f = lambda x: [*range(1,x), *range(x, 0, -1)] [print(' '*(9-max(f(i))), ''.join(map(str, f(i)))) for i in f(9)]

Thanks I'm going to check this out. I'm studying Python through a UDEMY course but it is not as in depth as I would like.
Bookmarking this one too.
The entire article is unpythonic crap, please don't waste your time reading it as I've just done :-(
Currently working through this and I like it a lot. I know Java from before so the "Part 1" was pretty easy, just "translating" syntax for the most part. But the projects are really nice.

very nice!!!
You are an inspiration. Thank you for sharing your story! :)
No he didn't. Or he didn't understand what he was doing, because what he wrote is a complete bullshit / doesn't make sense if you know these things work. And yeah, I'm quite sure that you are an idiot, but that's not an interesting subject to talk about.
Snip &amp; Sketch will become the future default. You can actually undo any drawings you made, so it's already better then the snipping tool.

I have an interest in building something similar (interactive website over py scripts). Any guidance on learning how?
Ugh. That site is so ad laden and slow. It's like 12 seconds to load a screenshot there. 
&gt; This is because Python programs do not get compiled. &gt; didn't want to get into the weeds and confuse the issue. Unfacts do confuse the issue. Better to say that the python compile time is usually insignificant.
Maybe you can start use Python for your hobby first, before tackling real job. In my case, I scrap online manga using Python, automated folder naming for each chapters. That also can build your portfolio for job interview :)
What do you mean by due to "the primary uses"? To me, it sounds like you mean language changes when most people use a word in a certain way so we say the language changed. If that is what you meant it is a lacking description. It begins with one or more people starting to use stuff in a currently incorrect way. Some incorrect use just fades and dies, some grow and then in the end becomes the new correct use. It is a bit like mutations in nature. If you meant something else, I did not get what you meant.
Nope, you are full of shit, especially if you think that bdist_wheel is the old way of doing things. That's actually a very modern one. And, being a contributer to `pip` is more like saying that a person is, in fact, an idiot. It's such poor quality code that I wouldn't know if to cry or to laugh first. It's sad because so many people are using it, while it's such a poorly written program. On the other hand, one day, I won't have to deal with it, and I'll be rolling under my desk every time some moron like you will ask me to fix their Python dependency problems.
&gt; What are exceptions? Judging by their name it is an entity representing some exceptional situation that happens inside your program. No. Exceptions are a control flow mechanism that happen to be represented at runtime by an object that is an instance of a subclass of BaseException, and _usually_ a subclass of Exception. They do not _represent_ an exceptional situation, they are a raised as a response to such a situation... if not caught and handled by code in higher stack frames than where the Exception was raised the purpose of the mechanism is to immediately halt the Python interpreter and inform the user with some traceback about what has occurred. In practice most exceptions raised by code in everyday operation are intentionally caught and handled and are merely an operational detail of control flow. &gt; You might be wondering how do exceptions are an anti-pattern and how does this relate to typing at all? Actually I'm entirely unclear why this relates to typing at this point, since you're using a dynamically typed language. &gt; First, we have to prove that exceptions have drawbacks. Well, it is usually hard to find “issues” in things you use every day because they start to look like “features” to you at some point. Well no, that's called "begging the question" ... we can assume that exceptions have drawbacks; first _you_ must demonstrate that these drawbacks constitute an anti-pattern, and that the airquotes you just drew around words are demonstrably warranted. &gt; There are two types of exceptions: “explicit” that are created with raise keyword right inside the code you are reading and “wrapped” that are wrapped inside some other functions/classes/methods that you are using. All exceptions are explicitly raised by _something_, but I think I understand your meaning here, though I also think you're forgetting the enormous number of exceptions that underly every operation you undertake in the language (for instance iteration) and which you'll never encounter. In reality there are several kinds of exceptions: 1. An Exception you explicitly raise, which may go handled or unhandled, and if unhandled will panic the interpreter. 2. An exception that is raised by code "beneath" you, which if unhandled will panic the interpreter. 3. An exception that is raised by code "beneath" you which if unhandled will _not_ panic the interpreter... you usually never wasn't to interdict these. 4. An exception that is raised by you or code "beneath" you, which if unhandled will cause an ordered shutdown of the program... you pretty much never want to interdict these. &gt; All [your divide function] does is dividing two numbers. Always returning float. It is type safe and can be used like so: It isn't type safe, it's type annotated. And it doesn't always return float; it's annotated such that _iff_ two float values are passed in _and iff_ the **return** statement is reached, _then_ a float will be returned. &gt; So, despite your code is type safe it is not safe to be used. It's perfectly safe; your computer didn't crash, no damage has been done... the interpreter panicked. This does not constitute "unsafe"; in fact what it's done is presented your user with the information they need to correct their abuse of arithmetic. &gt; Almost everything in python can fail with different types of exceptions: You've got that right; the only thing I can't figure out how to crash is **pass**. That said, _most_ of those exceptions can only occur if your user is pathological, an idiot, or both... for instance the the code you've listed above can crash out with an exception in exactly 1 case _if_ your user passed in two **float** or **int** (or **bool**) values, and you've successfully identified that case. &gt; So, the sad conclusion is: all problems must be resolved individually depending on a specific usage context. This isn't a sad conclusion. This is reality. And nothing you demonstrate below this point makes that any less true. &gt; By the way, how can we tell where exactly it will be handled? Can we navigate to this point in the code? Turns out, we can not do that. Sure you can. If it happened below your code. If it happened above then you'd have to be some sort of a God to introspect that. &gt; We have two independent flows in our app: regular flow that goes from top to bottom and exceptional one that goes however it wants. How can we consciously read code like this? It doesn't go however it wants. It _always_ interrupts control flow and begins bubbling up the stack. It is always vertical movement that immediately exits the current frame and moves "up" into the calling code's frame. If unhandled it moves "up" again. And so on until the interpreter itself responds to it appropriately if all other stack frames have chosen not to handle it, intentionally or otherwise. &gt; Exceptions are just like notorious goto statements that torn the fabric of our programs. If this isn't hyperbole then I can't take you seriously any further. An exception behaves nothing like a **goto**... where raised it behaves more like a **return** statement, albeit one that involves a traceback process, where not handled it continues to work like a **return** that you didn't intentionally make. It does not move the execution flow to an entirely new and unpredictable location, and is quite deterministic. &gt; There are so maybe potential problems with these three lines of code, that it is easier to say that it only accidentally works. And normally it fails with the exception. And yet it moves. &gt; Now we got that exceptions are harmful to your code. You haven't made that point yet. I'm still trying to work out why you think you could _ever_ write code that didn't have exceptional cases... but you seem to think (including in a heading) that exceptions aren't exceptional ... no, they still are, they're just not uncommon. Exceptional _only_ means "deviating from the main" in Python... running out of things to iterate is an exceptional case in Python because the "main" case of iteration is to have a thing to yield and move on from. &gt; Maybe instead we can indicate that the result was not successful without any explicit numerical value? THAT IS WHAT THE EXCEPTION DOES!!! Sigh... at this point I'm done responding. I get it, you want something closer to how you'd handle these sort of cases in a statically typed and compiled language because you want the determinism that implies... great. Python isn't a statically typed and compiled language, it's dynamically typed, runtime interpreted language... and that model introduces the need for Exceptions as a control flow mechanism... at best you've demonstrated an alternative approach to _some_ exceptions -- not, for instance, SystemExit -- that you prefer. And wrapped it in a headline that makes an exceptional claim. But without anything I can see at this point that constitutes _exceptional_ evidence of your thesis. Made me think though. I do like how Rust handles exceptional and error cases in a similar fashion, but I still see why that's not a good fit for Python unless and until all those type annotations -- still very much a provisional feature of Python at this point -- become compile-time enforceable. Definitely can't agree with the tag line though.
This is really motivating and kinda sums up my current situation . I am glad I choose python and c++
Nail on the head there. And I don't think that the stereotypical "english as a second language" usage is catching on and becoming correct use. 
Fuck me, I bet you didn't even get your grade 9 with that level of reading comprehension.
Despite my career involving Java, Python and Javascript I started my journey with Schildt's C Reference and Prata's Primer Plus in university. I was finding hard my first semester, read those books on extended holidays and first weeks of second semester. After that it was smooth ride all along. I feel that every programmer needs a 2k pages read to start things up.
I'm from Indonesia.
I find using a resource like Zed Shaw’s ‘Hard Way’ series much better at teaching the basics of languages as well as intimating the nitty gritty details to newcomers of a language. I only find Oreily books to be useful as supplemental materials. (Not to suggest they aren’t worth having. I have dozens of them for every language I use and I love them).
Oreilly actually offers that book for free in PDF form online. They do that for a lot of books, often with the most up to date edition. Doubt you actually even were pirating. :)
I agree, but back then, I only googling for "Best Python book" And the result is only 2: 1. Learning Python - Mark Lutz 2. Dive into Python - Mark Pilgrim Which Dive into Python is a bit advance topics for beginner.
I purchased this book two months ago and I'm about 70% of the way through it. It is incredibly dense, but it gives you an amazingly thorough foundation in Python I haven't been able to get from any other book/website/tutorial series. I'd consider it essential reading if you're truly trying to master Python and object-oriented programming in general. Pro-tip: Find a PDF version, put the PDF on your phone, and get a good PDF reader app that saves your reading location. I use the Moon+ Reader for Android. Whenever you have even a few minutes of downtime, you can open it up and learn some new stuff. Another Pro-tip: Read through this thread summarizing the ["Learning How To Learn"](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/5950tm/text_i_just_finished_the_online_coursera_course/) Coursera course. It's an invaluable resource for learning how to trudge through dense, boring reading in the most effective manner possible. 
If Python isn't compiled why does it have [https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#compile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#compile)?
Never liked Dive Into Python.
Is it just me or did I detect just the slightest hint of humour in this article?
wow you’re toxic. can you please look up the rules of basic human decency or piss off?
Hahaha haven’t used it in ages. Wouldn’t know. When I did I thought it was pretty cool. 
Based on history and how things change faster now than in history, I won't try to make a prophecy about what languages will be like in the future. The rule that incorrect use has been the source of change is clear so far, though.
That's actually pretty cool 
As a big time TTRPG player, I approve of this project. Good luck with the rest of it!
Depends on context, doesnt it.
Thanks and woo!
I can help yeah. Send me a PM and explain what you're trying to do and I'll have a dig.
There are posts similar to this, that can help you with more info. &amp;#x200B; Things I have used Python for: 1. Flash my [Philips Hue](https://www2.meethue.com/en-us) lights when my sports teams scores. 2. Using flask as a framework to build a small website. 3. Update a Google Sheets document with data from API endpoints. 4. Created QR codes to provide Proof of Concepts to a company showing a vulnerability. 5. Browser Functional and Regression testing for a software web interface. 6. Script that would bowl strikes for me on a browser bowling game. 7. DirecTV remote through web interface and voice commands. Python can do quite a bit, you just need the right packages for it. To find specifics that work for you, find something you believe can be simplified, and begin investigating to determine if Python can help.
Hi, While I would imagine others will ask you to go to /r/learnpython, let us ignore them for now. I will assume that you have been able to generate an integer between 1 and 6. Have you been able to store the result to a variable? could you do the same thing 4 times, store it to 4 different variables. Could you then add those 4 different variables together?
Set 4 variables to a random number then add them together?
Hard tot give an exact answer without seeing some code. But I guess, for every dice, multiply by 5, round and add 1. Next sum the results of every dice.
Edbluetooth's method is a perfect way to do it but I'll try to simplify it even further (cause I'm a beginner too and I understand how much beginners love super simplified versions) Let there be five variables a,b,c,d and e to beging with. Code: #Let's import random first so that the code works import random #This is to generate the random number between 1 and 6 and store it in a variable a = random.randrange(1, 6) #Now we do the same for three other variables b = random.randrange(1, 6) c = random.randrange(1, 6) d = random.randrange(1, 6) #Now that we've rolled four different dice (by assigning random values to four different variables) we can proceed to add them e = a + b + c + d Print (e) 
You should learn those ML frameworks. You should learn more languages. You should learn more statistics. All of those will make you a better and more advanced programmer because they open your mind to new way of solving problems...even if you don't use specific knowledge from a field to solve a problem, you'll be able to approach the problem in new ways. 
No (I mean, yes, of course, but no)
How did you flash the hue lights? 
Getting a little into r/learnpython territory here, but they have a free developer API you can use just by signing up. Steps: 1. Signup for [Hue Developer Program](https://developers.meethue.com/login) 2. Find a way to get data into your program. 3. Monitor for desired change in the data 4. Initiate the API call to your lights for the desired effect you want.

There are plenty of workflow examples at kaggle. Currently, I am looking into parameterizing notebooks. Maybe with [papermill](https://github.com/nteract/papermill).
I had a chance to delve into the script this weekend and found it was quite useful. I also realized it would involve significantly more effort on your end to incorporate other services, since I realized it currently makes use of the NBA.com endpoints.
Sorry, but thanks! 
&gt; this sub should become THE beginner questions sub if only because it's the logical first place to look. Not a single tech subreddit that I visit operates like this. Language subs have an associated /r/learn{lang_name} or /r/{lang_name}help /r/programming doesn't allow generic beginner questions /r/netsec doesn't allow generic beginner questions etc. That's because it results in a sub filled with unhelpful, low value, low quality beginner questions and little discussion.

Hai serios... E de lăudat că încearcă. Nu trebuie să fii fluent în Engleză să poți posta pe Reddit...
&gt; the stereotypical "english as a second language" usage It's not that. English is my third language (out of four) and the only time I was messing it up so badly was when I started learning it. The stereotype should be associated with beginners.
wtf you can unpack ranges... that feels wrong
No problem! If you have any ideas feel free to make an issue on the Github repo!
As Python is open source do it yourself if you care so much, it's quite simply a case of put up or shut up as nobody in the open source community owes anybody anything.
Well ranges returns a list!
pypy asyncio will make things interesting when comparing high performance concurrency options.
No it doesn't, it returns a range object: &gt;&gt;&gt; range(5) range(0, 5) &gt;&gt;&gt; type(range(5)) &lt;class 'range'&gt; &amp;#x200B; Might have to look into unpacking iterables in general, seems to be possible
&gt; Nu trebuie să fii fluent în Engleză să poți posta pe Reddit... Se pare că nu. Oricum, să scrii un "wall of text" în *Engrish* și să nu te critice nimeni e grav, pentru că rămâi cu impresia că ai studiat suficient limba.
&gt; whats the point of `poetry run`? that command sets the virtualenv up to run your script right? virtualenvs have nothing to do with environment variables though. Environment variables are meant to be set in the environment that a utility is run in. Some more complicated processes allow you to load in .env files, but these are usually services and not command line utilities. If you really need to 'fake' the environment then do something like this &gt; env $(cat .env | xargs) poetry 
My mistake, ranges in python 2.x returned a list
`poetry run` is an execution environment. you directly run scripts with that command not just entering a virtualenv
Im really looking forward to this

I can relate to this story a lot. I assume you aren't living in a first world country just as I am, I've been pirating and stealing a lot of learning materials (though I tried to go for the free ones as well) and I've transformed my life from 200$ per month as a translator working from a super cheap Lenovo laptop I got from my moms to a python backend developer with an actual American salary and a company reimbursed Mac Pro over the last year. I am now buying everything I stole before and it feels refreshing to do that. It's like for third-world countries and really poor people there's just no choice, either you steal it or you don't have it. Not advocating for piracy or anything, but sometimes the choice isn't so black\\white. 
The execution environment is your shell though, not a command.
I'm pretty sure that's not the case. He/she never mentioned that they are fluent (or even good for that matter) in English. Just had something to say, and I applaud that.

So cool !
&gt; only because it's the logical first place to look. That's not really an argument. &gt; /r/programming doesn't allow generic beginner questions &gt; /r/netsec doesn't allow generic beginner questions Neither does /r/python, but it gets a steady stream of them every day making more work for mods. You can't just say "no /r/python beginner posts" and walk away. You have to account for the fact that you're trying to regulate human behavior and work with it. &gt; That's because it results in a sub filled with unhelpful, low value, low quality, homework related beginner questions and little discussion. The current situation where /r/python gets a stream of 90% homework/beginner questions and 10% discussion is even worse than that because the discussion is buried in the noise.
How did you made the terminal font coloured on windows?
It's not an "unfact". It's reading between the lines of what the question asker meant when they said "compile". If you say compile time is usually insignificant that just raises more questions. Then, we're left with a situation where the innocent beginner either continues a conversation where they're not supposed to be, or they walk away with these niggling questions or wrong assumptions. "Why is it insignficant for python but not C++ (or whatever)?", "Python must be super fast for it to compile so quickly!", and a dozen others.
Hah, I didn't want to go into the list comprehension land, but your solution is very clever, using string formatting to indent and center like that wouldn't have occurred to me.
Thanks, I have enjoyed reading your response. What I really like about this article that it happened to be a conversation-starter.
Could the [PyPy Speed Center](http://speed.pypy.org/) charts get updated soon? They're really old...
Cobol!?! They are still teaching cobol? Seems like some of the faculty are still stuck in the 1970's. 
I'm with Joe Gregorio that design patterns are code smell. He gave a PyCon talk in 2009, The (lack of) Design Patterns In Python. https://pyvideo.org/pycon-us-2009/pycon-2009--the--lack-of--design-patterns-in-pyth.html https://www.slideshare.net/hustwj/the-lack-of-design-patterns-in-python Python just doesn't have Java design patterns. He dismisses the factory pattern in Python like so: https://image.slidesharecdn.com/thelackofdesignpatternsinpythonpresentation-110905134722-phpapp02/95/the-lack-of-design-patterns-in-python-22-728.jpg?cb=1315231345 
I too just started learning to program using python, but unlike yourself, I took 2 years of computer science while in highschool. Mainly JavaScript and minor low level stuff is what I learned. But when I picked up: Learning Python for the absolute beginner 3rd edition, it is a great first starting point if you have no prior knowledge of programming. And all of the example code within the book is available online for download while you write your own. P.s. - I highly suggest writing your own variation of the same code the author uses while you read each chapter, so you can learn from your own mistakes. It enables you to re-read parts of the book as you decide to implement slight variety to the code you write, pounding the information into your head just that much more. 
👍🤘
I am trying to recreate the Undertale attack mechanics in Python this week. I can't post because my account isn't two weeks old, but was wondering if anyone knows if I can take keyboard input with python or if there was any other way to do it. It would greatly help my project. Thanks.
HA! Just taking my first python class and my professor had us get this book!
Looks nice. Can you add couple of issues for things you'd like contributions for? Or mention of you want help with testing it.
Is 250MB really that big nowadays? Especially on a 32GB machine I'm a little disappointed at the performance. Do you think any of this is Spyder?
Here you go: for i in [*range(1,9),*range(9,0,-1)]:print(f'{int("1"*i)**2:^17}')
I’m working on an rpg game atm. All text based so it works on online editors also. 
Interesting. Seems like there's no real demand for it then? If pythoncoding died and this one didn't take off...

Is he still anti-py3? 
Well **pipenv** is definitely _a_ of doing this, but I'd say the jury remains out on whether or not it is _the_ way, or certainly the _best_ way. If you need to manage _multiple_ Python interpreters and you're on Linux or Mac then **pyenv** is the most established means of doing so. There aren't any other well-established competitors in that particular space, though today I learned about **pycors**, which looks interesting but very early days. For managing dependencies and getting truly deterministic builds there's both **pipenv** and **poetry** ... I have been using **pipenv** without any serious issues, however I keep seeing a lot of people arguing for **poetry**. I intend to try that next. It seemed to be a little more aimed at libraries than applications, but it seems that distinction isn't as solid as I thought it might be. So perhaps evaluate **poetry** as well, if only to cover your bases.
This is exciting for the community but I am bummed they still haven't fixed the [`os.stat.st_birthtime`](https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/issues/2693/osstat-and-st_birthtime-on-macos-hfs) "bug". I use quotes since from the Python docs, it is not a guaranteed attribute, but since it exists in CPython for macOS, it would be nice to have it in PyPy. (I not feeling entitled here. I get that there are lots of things with higher priority. But I am still bummed)
No he finally came around to the realization it's the future and it's better. Even wrote a new updated book just for python 3. He does have some wacky ideas, but I think he still teaches languages really well.
That's great news. I learned with PTHW years ago, but no longer recommended it after it was clear his py3 predictions were false. 
1. "it’s very important to understand it and know how apply it." -&gt; "it’s very important to understand it and know how *to* apply it." 2. "return json.dumps(payload)" -&gt; "return json.dumps(song_info)" 3. The `SongSerializer` method makes no sense. All you need are as_xml and as_json properties in the Song class. Furthermore, having these methods would allow intellisense to complete for existing properties and fail for non-existent ones. 
&gt;United States in the southeast, North Carolina. I think another part of them having a hard time is I get the vibe it's a 50-60 hour a week type job with 30-40% travel. Ah, okay, cool cool. I live din outer London and competition for prestigious positions in the City is pretty high, but a lot of solid firms are still desperate for good devs/analysts that actually have decent communication and interpersonal skills to boot. Yeah, I imagine those hours and travel would dissuade a lot of people particularly settled down with families; if you're young though sounds like it could be fun. I'm sure you can learn the necessary skills on the job, best of luck if you take it!
That makes sense, $150 a month is unsurvivable in America. 
`mypy` can do this: from typing import Optional class Foo: def __init__(self): self.bar = 0 def checkit(foo : Optional[Foo]): # fails to check as expected: if foo is None: foo.bar = 42 # checks as expected if foo is not None: foo.bar = 42 # does not check, thinks 'foo' can be optional inside the if: if foo is Foo: foo.bar = 42 However, disappointingly `mypy` doesn't do a thing if parameter `foo` isn't annotated. Not even when I tried `--strict-optional`. 
That was an illuminating talk. However, be clear: the 'factory` pattern is different from the 'factory method' pattern and he dismissed the factory method pattern in that slide. 
I suggest [a spoonful of advanced python a day](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9us66v/a_spoonful_of_advanced_python_per_day/). 
Im actually starting Python now ! Already learned about functions and variables. 
No no, we are talking about Python.
I think a good step would be to think about your day to day problems. There can be ways that software/hardware can help solve those problems. It is very motivating to work on a problem that impacts you
This is you lol
Thanks, check out the new single page layout, it retains the form values.
If you are a beginner in python and learn all the basics with real examples, get this ebook from playstore https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=T_iEDwAAQBAJ You may read the reviews before buying too. Also visit https://codeshut.blogspot.com/ for more python and automation related stuff. Another recommended book is Al's automate boring stuff with python.
can you share some more info?
Yeah, but i probably already have everything i need to make my days easier...
Interesting. The [image in the docs](https://github.com/hosseinmoein/DependencyGraph/raw/master/dep_graph.png) appears to be abstract and not related to the actual example. Also I wonder how solid lines differ from dashed lines in that sample graph. State machines can be implemented in Python with `yield` with an argument along with send as shown [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36868212/149741) There are also a number of libraries with related functionality that you want to list in `SEE ALSO`: * https://pypi.org/project/python-statemachine/ * https://pysm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ * https://pypi.org/project/super_state_machine/ * https://docs.openstack.org/automaton/latest/user/examples.html * https://pypi.org/project/pyeds/ * https://pypi.org/project/transitions/ 
Really prestigious positions are extremely difficult to get in the US too, but data analysis in its current form is still a budding field so tons of older companies are hiring and a new company opens up for it like every 30 seconds
This made me want to try to go back and study python harder than before, and recovered my deep break i had due the fact I moved off because I was overwhelmed by stress and I really wanted to make games but then I gave up on that too for other reasons, I wanna be productive again, so I will restart putting my hands in the dirt and get out with good project, I love you
It’s really not really the size of the file but that it’s excel. First If your using modern excel, .xlsx extension then the data is already zipped up. You can test this by just changing the extension to zip and opening it. This means your data is actually larger then 250MB and for python to read it it first has to uncompress it first. How much data will depend on how compressible it is. Second as eluded to Excel is not friendly to work with. (From any language really) In my recommendation I didn’t state for you to change the size of your data, just to get it out of the excel format into a cleaner simpler format. Your problem is probably not spyder although you seem concerned about that. You could test your theory by running the script directly from the command line. I’ve done a lot of projects with excel because that’s the format a lot of business work with and it’s always a problem. 
Damn, I was thinking about pushing PyPy in my company when they released 3.6, now it's getting closer
I waned to say the exact same thing!
Lab - is Labaratorna?
Oh that's a good one. Thanks for the tip. I'll use that a lot.
Really cool, nice job. The documentation on your functions is really nice. I am going to steal this as a template for English language articles. 
Any idea on "Learn Python 3 the hard way"?
What would be the Python 3.7 equivalent of Python Crash Course ? 
What would be the Python 3.7 equivalent of Learn Python ? 
Congrats, more than my “hello world” lol
thanks for the "see also". The image and the example are not related. it would have been nice if they were :-) I am not sure how implement dependency with yield? 
Do you know python already? If not it doesn't matter what version you're using until you know the fundamentals.

Depending on the area, that's easily a billable rate per hour in America. Kind of sobering...
I can write code (C# and Java) , not python tho. I want to learn all the pythonic wurly-dos but I worry about learning from a book based on python 3.3 or is it 3.4? I doubt there's a ton of changes but I thought going from 3.4 to 3.7 introduced a lot of new powerful features. Having said that, I could be wrong. 
&gt; Was it pretty easy to read and understand the book? Its extremely easy... and the size is because of the relaxed pace. The book takes time to explain stuff and work through examples, etc. In my experience, smaller books are usually more daunting, because the explanation is terse and fewer examples / exercises to aid in learning. That said, longer books can be sleep inducing. 
Large Car dealerships are about $100/hr labor charge
Knowledge should be free. Thanks for sharing.
Sorry and thanks! 
Wow this is just so badly misinformed. I'm going to assume it stems from his lack of python experience but still, half his issues are because he wrote shit code complain about in the first place.
For starters the code you wrote as an example has to be purposely really bad to illustrate your point. The problems you have with exceptions stem from this straw man code rather than the exception construct.
Style tip: put spaces around your binary operators (like +, -), makes the code look better. https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#other-recommendations
I found "Learn xyz the Hard Way" actually stands for "Learn xyz the irritating way by excessive and repetitive rote learning". Its not actually hard in the way that it requires to you to do anything you might traditionally consider hard - like thinking or employing dexterity. What it requires you to do is not get irritated by its approach, sit on your desk hour after hour and do the same relatively easy thing again and again - and not fall asleep or get irritated or give up. Sure... if you press the button "a" on the keyboard a thousand times, you will learn how to press the button "a" very well, but the approach is very irritating to me. I personally hate the whole "Learn xyz the Hard Way" series... YMMV.

&gt; I am not sure how implement dependency with yield? It's yield with an argument supplied, [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36868212/149741) is a simple linear example, but with the use of `if-then` you could create branches. 
Well, luckily it happens rarely, but i usually (not necessaruly in that order) do: * Break up in tears, scream and kick around for a few seconds * Pull myself together * Run the local test suite .. again .. just to make sure (did i forget before pushing? I lost my pre-push testsuite hook a while ago..) * Analyse the failure (which part is affected or causing this? Usually the CI system. I should probably build my own (LXC based) CI... * Read up on duckduckgo how to fix it - which essentially leads me to Stackoverflow. Sigh - what would we do without, these days? * Use the information i gathered there or elsewhere to fix the problem * Wait and observe the hopefully fixed build * Bask in the green glow of my repaired build badge or start from top of the list Yes, all that can take up to an hour. HTH :)
You're not going to learn new features in any crash course or book. You learn the basics than use the new features as tools. If you know you want to use some specific feature than read about it. Sounds like you're going about it backwards.
You should look into using a Python profiler. The standard library [provides](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html) tooling for both native Python profiling as well as for C extensions. When profiling, look for specific bottlenecks: is your program CPU-bound, or RAM-bound? In either case, is the *-bound part of the code correctly optimized, or is it just an inherently slow piece of code relative to the hardware you're running it on?
Did you just assume their gender? Js
I note that the current edition of *Learning Python* is the 5th edition, published in 2013, and covering Python 2.7 and 3.3. While trying to find out whether a 6th edition is in the works, I found Mark Lutz's page on all the changes to Python since 3.3, as covered in the book. It's here: [https://learning-python.com/python-changes-2014-plus.html](https://learning-python.com/python-changes-2014-plus.html)
I really need to know what foreign accent to read rustyworks's posts in.
I started 1 year ago to work as a student, programming in python . I just love, how the unittests in TDD (test driven development) work well together with implementing a class or function. Do you have any good or bad experience with TDD?
It's okay, no need to apologize! I was just horsing around and curious about "are there any Russian-speaking people on r/Python right now" when I had written in Russian. It was kinda unexpected! Do u have account on Github?
&gt;provides Very interesting suggestion! I didn't know there was such a thing in Python. This would be a good place to start to see where bottlenecks may be occurring. Thank you for this suggestion.

Am I the only one who noticed the irony of a message negging Powerpoint that appears to have been written in Powerpoint? And its not true anyway: most Python code has nothing to do with machine learning. And even the code which is related to ML is probably just a thin Python wrapper around the real ML code which is written in C or Java. 
The standard library is definitely a goldmine if you're willing to do a bit of digging. `pdb` is another favourite, although IMO it's nicer to use `ipdb` from PyPI which includes iPython integration.
I wonder why most of IDEs for Python are written in C++. *thinking*
I recently purchased this book, I'm glad to see someone else approves!
Just a guess: pandas could be he culprit here, not something I would call "lightweight" in regard of importing thing. Can't say anything without knowing your OS, your hardware, your version of Python and the contents of your python virtualenv (I hope you are using one? :) ). But you are not alone with this: [https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/7282](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/7282) A good practice is to create a requirements.txt for a project to facilitate letting others know what needs to be installed in order to get it running. &amp;#x200B;

Typically in bigger-data applications, you'd basically do this kind of flow: if dataframe_exists_in_optimized_serialized_format: pd.load_optimized_serialized_format(path_to_optimized_serialized_dataframe) else: df = pd.read_excel(...) df.to_optimized_serialized_format(path_to_optimized_serialized_dataframe) In 2019, that optimized serialized format is often either `msgpack` or `parquet`, both of which have decent support in Pandas (although `msgpack` is experimental, but works most of the time). `df.to_parquet` and `dd.read_parquet` are both also supported in Dask, which I can also recommend. The idea here is that those optimized serialized formats sacrifice human-readability for quicker serialization and deserialization. Parquet is extremely good at this, speaking from experience.
Can't believe I didn't have a requirements.txt file. Just added it to my github repository. I'm running Python on OSX High Sierra on a 2017 MacBook Pro running Python 3.7. My project is running in a venv to maintain package dependencies. Thanks for the comment!
Would be pretty easy to add it, come ask us how on #pypy on IRC. We do not have an active mac OS enthusiast so it is not really on our radar
Not much has changed. Do you have a favorite benchmark you are concerned about?
I’m just starting to learn python. Super excited and I want to put in ~10 hrs this week. It’s gonna be a grind but I’m sure it’ll be worth it
&gt;msgpack Thanks for the recommendations. I'm gonna look into msgpack and parquet tonight and maybe even play around with them a bit in my dev environment. Are you using either in a current project? 
Thanks1 I used the Numpy style documentation. &gt; I am going to steal this as a template for English language articles. Be my guest! Later today I will commit a few more fixes.
There's a noob python sub ;)
Exact same? Complete with the same URL and all? XD I guess printing Pascal's Triangle, Magic Matrix, Spiral Matrix, diamonds and circles is what we all started our journey with. And look where we're now! :)
Thank you for listing my book "Clean Architectures in Python". I hope people will find it useful. I publish some Python posts on my blog thedigitalcatonline.com as well.

I wouldn't self-classify as a total noob. I can install python and build a few programs. Looking for helpful feedback, mate.
I see. The whole point of what I did was to have an alternative to \`if-else\` approach. In large systems with complex dependencies, \`if-else\` approach does not scale and is not practical. Think of Excel 
Congrats programming it realy changed your life. Keep learning, don't stop.
Impressive
I'm Al Sweigart, the author of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python. All of my books are free to read online under a Creative Commons license, but print and ebook copies are also for sale. For the most part, I don't mind piracy of my books, as in people downloading copies to read for themselves. The people who pirate my book because they can't afford it aren't the people who would've bought it anyway. The main thing I need from IP laws is protection from other people taking my book and selling bootleg copies of it. If anyone pays money for it, that money should go to me and the employees at my publisher. Also, it's in general a dick move. I don't mean "Al says everyone can pirate his books" because the editing team and other employees at No Starch Press deserve their paychecks. It you can afford it, buy it. Their jobs are just as important and necessary as mine, even though they don't get their name on cover like I do. But imagine if we had Star Trek replicator technology to cheaply construct anything, but we artificially limited them due to "intellectual property" restraints. That's where we are right now with cheap disk space and an internet full of easy-to-copy bytes. I don't fully buy the argument that without this money incentive, new creative works wouldn't be made. That's certainly not the case with me; I started writing programming books as a hobby, and was able to continue doing so mostly because I 1) had a software engineering job that wasn't an 80-hour a week hellfest and 2) was unmarried, without kids, and in good health. I had the financial support and free time to do what I do, and it turned out to be something really good. Not everybody has the same privileges that I do. (If you want to feel depressed, think about all the Einsteins we've had that never went anywhere because our society decided they should be ditch diggers, seamstresses, or slaves instead.) And look at Disney: they built their entire empire off the back of public domain stories (Cinderella, Little Mermaid, Aladdin... [even Lion King was a well-made work of plagiarism of Kimba: The White Lion](https://youtu.be/UfJvKIDS9n8?t=328)) while lobbying for anti-public domain, Mickey Mouse copyright protection laws changes that cheat our entire culture. And even though they're a billion-dollar company, they still don't produce original works: now they're just recycling their old animated movies into live action ones precisely because the money incentives make them *not* want to create new, original works. [On that note, I'll leave folks with this article on Mr. Rogers testifying how much benefit VCRs provided.

Let me know what you think of crash course.
Bravo to you. I'm a "hobbyist" programmer and I learned Python (really, I learned to program) from this book, too. I read it more or less straight through up to and including the OOP part, then would just thumb through it at random for many years. I lost the book in one of the California fires in 2017, glad to see in one of the comments that there's a PDF version online now.
For fresh graduate in my country is about 2 million rupiah or about 142 USD. Even the top 10 start up, only provide about 10 times (about 1420 USD). But if you compare for living cost, of course in Indonesia is far cheaper than America.
Where can one find an overview of them? It's not clear which have how much overlap with which and why to read how many. 
Have you read this? It's not simple. https://bugs.python.org/issue32947 
TIL pirates were data scientists.
I liked LPTHW, but it falls apart when it comes to classes and why you would use them. 
I'm pretty familiar with programming concepts, but yeah, from what I heard, it's definitely not a resource that details a lot.
Thank you. I'll practice using it some now that I know what it is. 
Checkout the new hotness with https://www.starlette.io/
I have that exact book. I've never actually finished it because it is such a monster to get through, but packed full of information. I still plan on getting through it one day.
Yeah man, stop with the import * stuff. That kills my motivation to figure out what's going on, I don't feel like tracking down things 6 files deep.
Just impulse bought cookbook on humble bundle pumped to get into it
Thanks for the suggestion. Would you recommend that I decentralize my imported functions and keep them locally in the file where they're run? I was trying to clean things up, but I'm beginning to think that makes understanding what is going on a bit less clear and slows the program down. For the most part, I'm not running anything imported from my *import \** that isn't directly used in that file. 
Thanks. I will have to try to figure that out. I'd even be willing to help if there is a case where I have the know-how.
Consider using pycharm over idle.
Can you give us the program? It sounds awesome!
Mind sharing when you get it in English? I'd like to see it in action.
It's not the centralized imports that's annoying, it's the import * stuff. I can't see where things are coming from. Tracking down imports is a lot easier to read for those unfamiliar if you have something like import Handlers.menu_selection_options as menu_options It's way more clear seeing menu_options.GLBL_USER_CHOICE than just a random variable naems GLBL_USER_CHOICE from god knows where. Even if someone needs to go a few deeps they at least know where they're going. I kind of figured you just did it to make it easier for yourself to not run into import errors. Also, the speed difference is negligible, having a few strings and functions in separate namespaces isn't going to be what slows your program down.
If your site opens up with a popup in my face, I don't want to hear what you have to say about webapps.
Can you re format the I cant see the top part of your code.
Damn...yes, your reasoning makes a lot of sense. I really appreciate this suggestion. THIS (among other great responses) is why I posted on here for some feedback. I'll refractor my import statements to reduce code hunting. This is something I probably would've been made aware of if this was a collaborative project. Much appreciated. 
best of luck 
Yeah man NP. Also real quick, since your user is only allowed one input at a time, you should change your if statements to elifs so it doesn't have to check every condition every time. And it's a stylistic thing but I prefer creating a dictionary mapping to desired functions instead of a ton of elifs. I'll edit more in a sec I gotta plug my phone in.
Vs code is nice too
Away from PC, will do tommorow. All it's doing is defining variables and functions. Functions re assign variables withen them
Do you have any resources you could recommend on classes? 
I think it is excellent for the fundamentals. But the later half of the book (or like 1/4) it really really is confusing
Udacity’s free [Intro to Computer Science](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-computer-science--cs101) course is invaluable to a new programmer.
That deal was so sick. I got the $15 tier and got all 15 books. I also learned today that Windows 10 has a feature that TTSs PDFs eBooks are so rad
Consider just using notepad over pycharm
Automate the boring stuff was such an amazing learning experience. The author Al Sweigart is also streaming live coding lessons on twitch!!!
If you are writing scripts VSCode is fine. But I think IDEs are better if you are working with bigger projects
The one in the left is very focused on memorization. I don't think that's a good way to learn to programme. The one on the right is legit. The one in the middle is **awesome**. Start with it.
Not OP, but I think it's the best.
&gt;if log(log(terrorism)) == 0: &gt; &gt;fight(hunger) &amp;#x200B;
Take it in small bites my friend and enjoy the journey. 
Automate has good projects, but it's very basic on the fundamentals. I prefer Python Crash Course for that part.
~~consider writing it out on a physical piece of paper~~
Classes are typically a collection of functions that are easily reusable in other code. A good example would be a input validation. You don't want to rewrite data validation every time you need it, so you build a class that has functions for various data verifiers like isemail(string), or iscomplexpass(string). You simply include the file in the header so that when you built a function that requires validation, you simply call the function you built in your class file. Hope that helps.
I'd stop reading LPTHW when it gets to object oriented and switch to a free book called "how to think like a computer scientist" for that section. Will definitely give you a solid understanding
I've taken advanced programming in C++ (data structures) in college. This is simply a refresher and learning a more on the fly language. I'll keep it in mind though as I haven't programmed in 5 years.
A twitch session might be cool.
I'll keep that in mind. Thank you!
Yeah that's why I got a couple books though, to see which one will catch me most.
This was a great resource for classes and OOP http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/
Haven't tried but I hear good things.
Idk man, i only read that one book and then I started reading documentations and Reddit posts to get some deeper understandings of stuff I didn't know
It's not a bad book, but I prefer having a stronger foundation before going for external resources.
Currently reading that one. Really good book. 
Then I would definitely suggest Derek Banas on youtube. The man is fast, understandable and great if you already know the basics

Anaconda has a notebook? 
Thanks for the cool post!
Yeah it ended today sadly. They usually have python stuff on there every month or so. May be worth signing up for the mailing list to know when deals come through
You either need to declare in the functions that they are to use the global variables [ties, wins, losses], or you need to pass the variable to the function and return the new value... def gotWin(wins) wins += 1 return wins wins = gotWin(wins)
No worries- I'm sure well worth full price too. I'll pick it up on pay day this friday.
Yeah seriously! And furthermore, what's with all these stupid print('hello world') and for i in [1,2,3] tutorials?!! Just tell me how to build a physics based dragon mmo! Why on earth would I need to iterate through 1 2 and 3???!!!

And VB6. Even our computer labs still running on windows 2000 though.
How good is TTS on books that involve code?
&gt; Classes are typically a collection of functions The definition I like is that classes are **data** and the functions that act on them. In C# and Java you can have classes that are nothing other than a collection of functions simply because being "pure" object-oriented languages, they don't have stand-alone functions so they had to cheat. What you're describing sounds more like a library to me than a class. 
i dont see the ATBSWP. well that is one hell of a book
Can agree. Went through the whole P2THW as a coding newbie and still have no idea.
Please don't suggest Quora I hate it

&gt; Classes are typically a collection of functions Nope. A /module/ can be a collection of functions. A class is typically something to track some kind of state and implement functions that mutate or use that state in some way.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOEZ... vim ALL THE THINGS!
Why would you waste your time on notepad, you think it will make you remember the code if it doesn't have auto complete? Are you 12?
Would you really recommend vim to a beginner learning python?
Dude..... How the hell did I screw that up. You're correct. I mixed library with a class.
Hah, not a chance in hell. Hence my edit :)
I do not want to come off rude, however there are many directions you can go, and this isn't the best subreddit with the question you currently have. 1. There are Frameworks you can easily search if you want to do a web interface. 2. GUI can be done with Tkinter is a GUI package you can use, and has good tutorials online. I would recommend going looking and researching for the direction you choose. Then if you have any questions and can show the code you have created, the people at r/learnpython can help you further, and point you in a direction that help you understand python and its packages better.
It’s not outstanding and gets awkward when they say things like “underscore underscore init underscore underscore”, but I use it to supplement my reading, not as a pseudo audiobook. You can play and pause each page individually, so if you see a page with a lot of code, just read it normally. I’m liking it a lot on the Raspberry Pi book that was in the bundle, though. 
Looks awesome
Programming bundles come back over and over again on Humble, if you're not in any particular hurry, fyi.
Ok thank you :)
Thanks! No hurry, but better to start now than later.
Oh thanks btw I read that answer before on stackoverflow .
No I had to jump into that fire all by myself. Inheritance is probably the center part of the entire language (or at least of OOP in general). I had a hard time wrapping my head around it until I read that “everything is an object in python”. Later, when making a Qt GUI, well you just need to figure it out. Interestingly I think they teach kids this idea first now, instead of variables and print statements. At least it’s kinda that way in the iOS playgrounds app. 
It is more than possible, though not always the easiest approach. Try [beeware](https://pybee.org/) for cross platform python mobile apps. There are other frameworks out there, but this should get you pointed in the right direction.
Get this: it was a joke
JPJ has a really good approach to Classes/Objects imo: &amp;#x200B; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIdperUu-A&amp;index=1&amp;list=PL6lxxT7IdTxEloArZ2ZSRWCy5jQpD5VtT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaIdperUu-A&amp;index=1&amp;list=PL6lxxT7IdTxEloArZ2ZSRWCy5jQpD5VtT)
I bought the full bundle too, I'm dying to bust open Python and Raspberry Pi cookbook
Yeah I had a brain lapse. I just dealt with Powershell's built in classes last week. Confused classes and libraries. Don't have any idea how I did that.
interesting what will be faster: pure pypy+asyncio or python+uvloop

Am I the only one pedantic enough to be bothered that he still uses `capWords` instead of `snake_case`? 
Very original idea! Also it may be interesting to research how people react on positive and negative rating. Forums with similar rate system (like reddit) give me an idea, that if rate if positive so people will rate it in positive way and vice versa. 
It is true about posts which are controversial, so ordinary person doesn't have any clear opinion and give a mark like majority of people have already gave the mark
I had no idea twitch was used for live coding sessions...freaking brilliant. Thanks! 
If you're on *nix system gnome-builder or kdevelop are good options with reasonably good syntax highlighting. Geany is a good option if you're trying to keep things light.
Obligatory reee for Visual Studio Code
Would also recommend Effective Python and Fluent Python
I got it and returned it in the same day for exactly that reason. If I wanted to figure everything out myself I'd just use Google, wasnt my kind of book personally.
Hello man, I had the same idea and a month ago and I am trying to figure out as well go to do this! My idea is to post the images / videos automatically in Instagram with the caption of the subreddit as well . I think there is a way to post in Instagram automatically ( look at the app "Apphi" in the play store). Please let me Know if you have been working on this any further. Have a great night!
Naah, it's fine. I use camelcase in Java and snake case in c, Python. Just stick with the language convention I guess.
Bookmarked. Thanks
Do you really need books to learn a programming language in 2019
Bookmarked. Thanks!
That's how I learn.
This was fun, here's what I came up with: d = '123456789' a = [d[:int(i)][:-1].rjust(8) + d[:int(i)][::-1].ljust(9) for i in d] b = [' '.join(i) for i in a] print('\n'.join(b[:-1] + b[::-1]))
Consider manually assigning the transistors with electric charge
Oficially, Python recommends to use EAFP: &gt;Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission. This common Python coding style assumes the existence of valid keys or attributes and catches exceptions if the assumption proves false. This clean and fast style is characterized by the presence of many &gt; &gt;try &gt; &gt;and &gt; &gt;except &gt; &gt;statements. The technique contrasts with the [LBYL style](http://docs.python.org//glossary.html#term-lbyl) common to many other languages such as C. &amp;#x200B; [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11360858/what-is-the-eafp-principle-in-python](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11360858/what-is-the-eafp-principle-in-python) In addition want to say, that each language isn't only about syntax. It is also about code style, usage patterns, community. It is a whole ecosystem (like /r/Python community). So if you like Golang error handling - just use go! it is also amazing language. But don't try to use Python as Go or Javascript as Java and so on.
A notebook is a notebook. You can work on your notebooks with Jupyter, Jupyter Anaconda, Colaboratory, Azure Notebook, Binder...
The best modern kit for the app store is looking like javascript w/ react native, followed by Java or Swift for Android/iOS respectively. Python is medium.
WOW HERE IS YOUR KARMA DUDE, YOU'RE SO COOL
Welcome to the party!
BEAZLEY
I have to python cookbook and PDF if anyone wants a copy lol
Also [Luciano Ramalho](http://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/5939) in his book Fluent Python has good explanation on differences between classic Java patterns and implementations in Python. For example, the classic Java style Strategy pattern may look like: class BaseStrategy: def execute(self, a, b): raise NotImplementedError class AddStrategy(BaseStrategy): def execute(self, a, b): return a+b class MulStrategy(BaseStrategy): def execute(self, a, b): return a*b strategies = [AddStrategy(), MulStrategy()] def max_value(a, b): return max([item.execute(a, b) for item in strategies]) &amp;#x200B; But you don't want to write so much code in python! Just use functions: def add(a, b): return a+b def mul(a, b): return a*b strategies = [add, mul] def max_value(a, b): return max([item(a, b) for item in strategies]) And it is true for any language which has functions as first-class citizens.
They're just different means of executing code against an IPython kernel. I primarily use PyCharm until I get tired of it spazzing out if I don't shut it down in the right order.
No
Awesome! Works like a charm. Great job. One more portable app on my USB key...
Sure buddy. Here is the GitHub link - https://github.com/abhprk32/python_music/tree/master I have mentioned the required libraries there. Have fun !

You are wrong and you don't even try to elaborate. Ofc he can, but python isn't a great choice. That's all
Imagine you were sitting at a conveyor belt and passing in front of you were a series of white balls of different sizes. You can count; the first ball is 0, the second ball is 1, and so on. Eventually there will be black ball, and when you see that black ball you stop and report back which number was the largest white ball seen so far. Basically all you ever need to know at any point is the number of the largest white ball so far, and whether or not the white ball in front of you is bigger than it was.
PCC is the best programming book I have ever owned.
Yes. But remember you are already using classes and objects all over the place. A list is a class for example.
Dear sweet baby Cthulhu on a stick, what in hell is going on in this thread ?! I found this article interesting, the author may have rushed publication a bit but it's overall packed with valuable information, so screw typos. I've been a pythonista for more than a decade and learned quite a few tidbits, which is exactly what I'm hunting for here. I've been toying with pyproject.toml, and I think I'm going to use the backend API in my home-brewed, horrible, build chain, and see where that leads. A bunch of thanks for posting this! 
Nah not dictionaries. That’s pure python. 
For what level of python programmer are those books relevant? I am not a fan of learning from books (I prefer Google) but I am wondering if I should read those books atleast skim through them. Do they have advanced topics?
i will suggest emacs witl elpy plugin. that will rock the bottom of yours.
Dict is a class. Fo reals. 
Reading those books won't make you a good programmer at all. It's all about experience and getting things done. The things, written in this books, can be easily obtained in the Internet. Never understood guys buying several books, hoping to learn something only by reading.
Why even comment?
Toxic. 
I really like Python Crash Course. Its very clear and concise about each chapters objectives. I'm on the second half of the book and wish i started it before tackling Python the Hard Way... which I didnt like very much.
Soy.
Their is at least a small percentage that my post will convince someone not getting a fool by buying books worth a hundred dollars not teaching them anything.
I read the left one in conjunction to learn python the easy way. Left one focuses more on python 2 if memory serves me correctly. It's been a while since I read it. 
It would be helpful to know how you tried to approach before, no matter if it’s right or wrong. I find it helpful to understand how the other person thinks so that I can cater an explanation to them. 
I'm doing my capstone course in my undergraduate, and am making a text based adventure game themed around my campus coded in python
Nah. Magic. 
Half of that book is "this is important, believe me really important. So important that you should go and google it. Go on, google it, I ain't explain it"
I recommend no books. Raw programming is best in such cases. Learn from practicing. 
Also any format of dead trees is so much less than many small interactive exercises which are easy to get for free online, my favorite is http://pythontutor.com
You can use Colaboratory ([https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)), store / manage your notebooks on GitHub and share them on [wwwgited.io](https://wwwgited.io).
Thought it was just me
Everyone would be better off forgetting about Zed Shaw and his contributions to the world. The Mongrel server (Ruby) was the bee's knees 10+ years ago. It had a good run, but that's all the credit I can give him. When he writes, half of it is code examples and the other half is bad advice or flat out wrong.
I'm not sure what that means, but a "lab" is a common term for a practical lesson where I'm from.
if you're just using basic python use the input() function.
Automate the boring stuff is also good .
Thank you! That analogy really helped actually. I'm more of a visual learner so I definitely could see the correlation.
I edited the OP to include my code, sorry about that.
Sorry about that, first time posting..I appreciate the info though!
The internet is a big place with lots of idiots around. Even if you find only good eggs with all the right answers, trying projects based on code you've pinched from GitHub or Stack Overflow and whatever YouTube tutorial got your attention is as self-limiting as "just" reading from a book. Besides, op didn't say they were "hoping to learn something only by reading." The books are a tool in a toolbox.
You could've saved money, since the at least the left two are available on the internet for free, IIRC.
Actually python is built off of FM technology- *fucking* magic.
Good. Now notice that your spec said "positive integers" not "positive floats".

I like learning python 5e by mark lutz
I don't use it but recently was recommended a function from it and looked up the source. There were literally 4 functions called in a row all with *Wege **kwargs and nothing else and no further functionality until it finally did something. You really start to wonder why they did it that way.
Are you using a version control system of any kind? 
Git?
&gt; I'm pretty familiar with programming concepts What made you get the books instead of... you know.. trying the language?
At least they are honest about it by saying that this is the "hard way". 
Here's where you're wrong. I've read his book, learn python the hard way (the one for python2) and I assume this one is exactly the same but with syntax for python3. My python level, when I started reading that book was, I'd say, past the scope of the book. As a consequence, I could discern what to extract from there and what not to. The thing is, **the design principles and good practices** he's teaching you are really **gold** (like why it's a good idea to write tests, how to write clean code, how to split logic, how to name functions, classes, etc. and **WHY** all the aforementioned, with really solid explanations), and if you follow them I can guarantee you that you'll write code better than most programmers out there. Like the vast majority not just a few. Even if you're a beginner and you barely know anything about coding, it's a very solid ramp up. Zed Shaw's book is the book to read **BEFORE** you start reading other, more advanced books.
Do you have multiple installs of python? Also /r/learnpython 
The guy's right. Pthw is a bad resource. You do better to read "Automate the Boring Stuff, with Python".
Wasting manpower? They do that because the companies that fund them use python 2.7. I’ll support python 2.4 if you pay me.
I gotta agree that the pandas API is a bit funky. I kinda feel like their attitude used to be, just build up as much functionality as they can as quickly as they can. Which has its obvious draw backs. However I think that's been acknowledged to an extent. Slowly but surely things are converging, lots of old functions are being deprecated, and old code styles are being updated. I think Pandas is a bit like matplotlib, where the API is a complete mess, but you build up your own way of working with it and from that you can do anything - though Pandas is a billion times better than matplotlib IMO!
Thanks to you, the book covers a topic on which there are relatively few resources.
yes, I found that I have two version of python(python 3.6.7 and anaconda 3.6.5) how can I solve the problem

[How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Interactive Edition](https://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/thinkcspy/index.html)
There were a few useful things in the Python 2 version of the book, but the guy went completely off the rails with the Python 3 stuff - to this day, he even states that python 3 will never be in wide use (it is) and that most libraries will never be updated for it (they have). While it is possible to learn from LPTHW (although it takes the right kind of person), it is known to cause a ton of issues for beginners. This subreddit's Discord server has [an FAQ about it](https://pythondiscord.com/info/faq), which links to [the SOPython article about it](https://sopython.com/wiki/LPTHW_Complaints). 
Maybe add new benchmarks?
Remove one. I’d keep the Anaconda one.
Thank you for this!! I have bookmarked it for later, I'm excited to delve in! :D
I have been working on builds for a long time, currently employed as SRE/DevOps. Spent a long time giving you some answers, hope it helps.
yeah I guess I was that right kind of person, and I have to say that I agree with what you've said. I even remember how he used to rant about Python3, but that was the trick, that I knew what to extract from what he said.
Ok... but why? Notebooks are inherently a client based activity. You don't need graphs and so forth on a server. 
Great article! And there is even more interesting stuff to discover at your website. Thank you for taking time and sharing your knowledge.
It makes sense to use both. pycharm has tons of well rounded features but vs code is a lot more lightweight and useful to quickly look at files, take notes, edit config files and stuff like that.
Python Crash Course is incredible. Eric Matthes is a fellow teacher and I use his book as a supplement in my classroom. I can’t wait to buy the 2nd edition myself and see what’s new. 
? Depends on what you do. We use Jupyter a lot here and all the data is on our servers so it's perfect to be able to tunnel it to your local machine.
can you please point me to an example for such a site with buttons and made with flask?
I bought the Python Crash Course last week! Good luck to us both, will be an exciting adventure! 
Well I learned something, thanks!
Good luck buddy!
I would look at [Kivy](https://kivy.org/#home) if you are serious about making a cross-platform game to run and distribute on mobile apps. However, you should understand that this is a complex framework and you will need to invest serious time into the project. 
Iirc, other way around. In python, classes are dicts under the hood
What happens when too focused on coding until 5am?
Have more confidence in your ability. Feel free to use what tools work best for you, without the need for others to interfere in how you work.
Practicing is much more useful than reading. That is the only way to really learn a programming language. Consider a platform such as exercism.io or codewars
This is maybe slightly off-topic, but you may also want to look out for [Google Code‐in](https://codein.withgoogle.com/) at the end of the year, which specifically is a program to help get pre-university students active in and engaged with open source—and several of the participating organisations use Python. A lot of GCI students also later return to their GCI organisation when they've enrolled in university to apply for [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), which is technically not an internship, but for many practical purposes it might as well be. Of course, this is a few years off if you're a junior in high school, but thought I'd mention it if you'd like to think even further ahead into the future. :) (Depending on your background, you may also find [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) interesting (note that you won't be eligible for Outreachy if you've already completed a GSoC participation), which *does* count as an internship.) Also, internship or not and GCI/GSoC/Outreachy or not, getting involved in a Python-based/Python-using open source project in your sphere of interest will likely help to provide mentors that will help answer questions you have and get you experience in working with real, used-in-the-real-world software.
r/learnpython You're welcome.
I’m currently on the middle book. It’s my first Python book and it can make an hour go by in an instant because the lessons keep you so focused.
Not sure what scale you need. If just a few people a *.pth file in site-packages pointing to a network drive folder holding the packages will work.
The "Python Crash Course" is by the same author if I recall correctly. So automating the boring stuff is great, but I'd still suggest the Crash Course first to get the hang of programming and doing the projects. Great book.
yep, we are using git, no style guides. Pointers in any direction would help
but you cannot easily install dependencies this way, or can you?
I'm a university 1st year student . What did you say about a 200$ translator job?
If you package your project and pip install from the git repository it should identify your requirements file and install accordingly.
The middle book is completely free online (I think?) but I went out and bought it because then I had the motivation to actually go through it all instead of skimming it because it was free. As for the content. It starts out pretty basically, it sometimes dips into a little more advanced things but not much. The first half is all intro, learning basic python functions and the like, the secomd half is divided into 3 projects, designing three projects using what you've learned in the first half. I haven't dipped much into that section but I'm sure it's relatively worthwhile.

I bought python crash course after trying it for free online because actually buying it and having the physical book gave me the motivation to actually move through it all when I was starting out. 
It takes a week to get use to it. You will give it a thousand thanks when you operate with Timeseries DataFrame e.g. `.resample` `.groupby(pd.TimeGrouper(freq='60Min'))`
I have the middle and right books. I have been buying up the bundles on humble bundle when they come up for sale. I prefer the eBook route so I can just use the search function when I want to get back to a reference I want to use.
Begone
Thanks!
*Woah!* It's your **5th Cakeday** spencerbot15! ^(hug)
If you have some interest in networking/forensics/hacking I'd recommend Violent Python. First chapter sets a good base for the python language in general, then every other chapter is on a particular subject. It's written so you can read it in whatever order you want so you can just skip to what you're interested in.
&gt;don't ever rely on a system-wide python install Actually that’s what I’ve settled on and stick with after 9 years of python development. Works great until you need to test in an older version / with older lib versions, and then there’s venvs to help you with that.
Hahaha. No, I don't need to. I have to talk to a moron like you virtually every day, sometimes multiple times a day, and sometimes even on weekends. I usually find you crying at the screen showing you PyCharm interface, where you hopelessly click with your mouse while sobbing and cursing your computer for not understanding you. And then, I'll be paid to fix your problem. Because you are an idiot programmer, who drank koolaid and never learned to think for yourself. Just followed the fashion blogs. I have very little sympathy for idiots like you, and I charge a lot because I like to see idiots like you part with their money. My only regret is that... well, I don't like to deal with this pile of trash a.k.a. Python distribution and packaging. I like to use things that work, that don't give me the headache. I'm just better than you at dealing with this crap, but outside of schadenfreude feelings, there's little to be had from this experience. Oh, and there's a nice feeling of telling an idiot that he's an idiot. Telling `pip` maintainer that his program sucks and how to fix it, while at the same time seeing him struggle to understand how his own program works and failing to implement the fix. There is something to that, yeah...
Kinda both. dict is a class and a class is kinda a dict
That book py3 is the way to go. Py2 end of life is 2020. And 3.6 is faster than py2 (I'm quite sure at least).
No, fuck people that don't stick to conventions
The same author? You recall poorly, I believe. Al Sweigart is not Eric Matthes. AFAIK. Automate is strictly for beginners, it's a quick introduction to the language, overview of general capabilities, et cetera, where as the crash course has you build projects. 
This looks great, would you be willing to share more information about how you create the customized parser?
That's when I got my first translator job as well, study + full-time work = fun times (zero sleep). Don't recommend!
I would say 1 2 3 in this order, while 3 is a lot worse. I can follow 1 pretty easily and 2 is also good (And much faster) if you're able to understand the code
Yeah, we are talking about snail vs tortoise kind of fast. Who cares? They are both too slow to make this an interesting subject.
But that won't give me an instant output unless a press enter I want to make a game that takes game inputs from keyboard clicks.
It's "Shaw". On that matter, at least, he's being deliberately belligerent and unreasonable. To be honest, most of his writing seems to be high on the shock value over any other characteristic. I don't at all believe that in 2020 Python 2.7 will go away entirely, but you'd be nuts to start new Python 2 development in 2019. &gt; Say, ”When all of the Python code, on your computer is Python 3, then I’ll try to learn it.” That should keep them busy for about 10 years. What an asshole!
If you just want to learn to program, and you don't intend to use Python after you've learned how to do it, then Python 2 is a better choice. It's a smaller and saner language. Not perfect, but OK. If you intend on using Python to earn your living, then, sadly, Python 3 is the way to go. Python 3 is bloated and designed by committee in the worst sense of the word. It's a really bad language to learn to program, but when did this ever stop the industry from using a language? I wish more people followed the advice from this book, when there was still time to avert the disaster. Now it's too late.
Github allows a lot of flexibility in terms of markup. With Microsoft’s recent requisition of it, users can now have unlimited private repos. You can do almost everything HTML can (embedded links, ordered and unordered lists, code snippets in place or longer ones get a paragraph). I love GitHub for making readme files and documentation
Serious question, why buy books when everything is readily available online? is it to stay focused or what?
My bad! Same publisher though (No Starch press)
I'll try to share my notebooks. Looks good.
Which bundle are you referring to? Could you please link it if possible?
I love GitHub too, but it has no way to extract API documentation, which is what I need to do.
If you declare a data class inherited from DataClassDictMixin \_\_*init\_subclass\_\_* method will look to the fields and type hints which you wrote and construct the code for two methods: *to\_dict* and f*rom\_dict* based on the information provided. This code will be executed once with *exec* function and after that your class will have two methods: for dumping to dict and creating the data class from dict exactly for your schema. For example if you have such data class: @dataclass class D(DataClassDictMixin): items: Set[int] two methods will be generated: to\_dict: def to_dict(self, use_bytes=False, use_enum=False, use_datetime=False): kwargs = {} value = getattr(self, 'items') if value is None: kwargs['items'] = None else: kwargs['items'] = [int(value) for value in value] return kwargs and from\_dict: @classmethod def from_dict(cls, d, use_bytes=False, use_enum=False, use_datetime=False): try: kwargs = {} value = d.get('items', MISSING) if value is None: kwargs['items'] = None else: if value is MISSING: raise MissingField('items',typing.Set[int],cls) else: kwargs['items'] = set([int(value) for value in value]) except AttributeError: if not isinstance(d, dict): raise ValueError('Argument for __main__.D.from_dict method ' 'should be a dict instance') from None else: raise return cls(**kwargs) There is a sort of checking so if you pass something wrong, you won't get strange errors.
This is not a learn programming sub, find the python for noobs sub
Trust me when I say I use it purely ironicly... 
Some actual reasoning or examples might help to prove your point here, particularly since the differences between Python 2 and Python programs is sufficiently small that it is quite easy to run programs that run on both.
Fluent python is great but only if you've gotten a decent handle on the language first. It's a fantastic intermediate book but not a beginner book.
Thanks, that's great to hear!
It might be. The point is you can inherit the dict class, and make your own overrides if you really wanted to. I’m guessing that classes are dicta might be how python manages it’s memory. That’s the whole: A = [1,2,3] B = A B[0] = 69 print(A) [69,2,3]
You can use the resources on the server without switching between client and server. Jupyter became one of my go-to tools to work on a server since it made prototyping and testing a lot faster for me.
What? Yes of course you can inherit dict, it's a class. And I really don't know what your code is supposed to show
Awesome! I went through half on left and got the basics down. The middle is very practical. The right i haven’t picked up yet. Otherwise tool around but worth every effort to unfold so many possibilities with this language. 
And yet nobody cares, downvote just in case.
Is there a guide on how to package a pure python library to pypi in 2019? I don't care about history of packaging and no plans to support python 3.5 or older. I have the following. [https://gitlab.com/balki/asynchttp](https://gitlab.com/balki/asynchttp) . Not sure if it is idiomatic.

Wow, way to crush that guy's dream, reddit. Downvoted for saying uplifting things to the kid, damn.
I would also recommend checking out think python. I've read a ton of python books and that was the only one that really resonated with me
Does anybody have a solution for the above issue? Any help is appreciated.

To cut down the time it takes for the menu to show initially, you can just remove many of the imports until they are absolutely needed (i.e. when the choice is made in the menu) 
I am doing a script for my masters in engineering. It takes raw current and voltage data from industrial sized batteries and calculates state of charge among other things. If all goes well it will in the long term be implemented on a cloud database of real clients battery data. Which would be great for my research!

The official Windows build of 2.7 uses OpenSSL 1.0.2o. It is possible on non-Visual C++ builds to use the latest OpenSSL 1.1.1a (MSYS2 uses it for example), but with the Visual C++ project files it's most likely going to be painful. If it's for security reasons as you say, do you absolutely need 1.1.1a? If so, you'll need to edit the project files, but other than that, it should be compatible. As it stands though, 1.0.2 is a long-term release and supported until 31st Dec 2019, and you should be able to recompile with 1.0.2q if you're concerned about security matters. Given that Python 2 meets its end of life at the same time as OpenSSL 1.0.2 does, this timeframe won't really matter.
Thanks for doing that! What you have looks right to me. You didn’t have the condition to terminate the loop? 
Just starting to learn python, trying to make a Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
For all of his contributions to Python education, Zed’s behavior regarding Py3 has been just short of trolling.

I'm not a native English speaker, so there will probably be mistakes. Currently I'm learning Django and trying to create something like a social network. I have already been done authenticated system, editing profile, post creation system. I also have to learn Bootstrap, JavaScript, AJAX to fast create a visual part of the site. Give me some tips how I can improve my programming skills.
God speed Python geek :)
If you google flask forms most results are for a library called `Flask-WTF` this is used to create super secure forms which are good for if you have a website that any (including malicious) users might use. If you trust your users, which you probably would for your own app, `flask-WTF` might be overkill. This tutorial does a good job of showing how to get data from form `POST` and `GET` requests, without `Flask-WTF`: https://scotch.io/bar-talk/processing-incoming-request-data-in-flask That said whilst maybe overkill `Flask-WTF` would still do the job. In Housenet, 3 forms are used on the same page - written here: https://github.com/0Hughman0/Housenet/blob/master/housenet/templates/profile.html#L18 And to submit the data from the 3 forms at once, I write a custom submit function here: https://github.com/0Hughman0/Housenet/blob/master/housenet/templates/profile.html#L124 And the submitted data is processed by flask here: https://github.com/0Hughman0/Housenet/blob/master/housenet/views.py#L25
The few self-help books I’ve read all start with the first quarter or so being a part on how important it is to read the book and follow its advice. It’s weird because I already have the book in my hands. I was planning to read it, you know? I guess PTHW follows that strategy. 
I use vim and I 100% agree
Hey there, any possibility to get the changed script? Would also be interested in english
I like having a goal (finish the book) and finding tidbits that aren't online. Also I'm a bibliophile and read a crap ton of books.
It's more like that the author got lazy when he had to explain something more complex than *print* or *for loops*, and he just said "fuck it, they can google it"
It's somewhat a collection of skeleton code that you can grab and modify for whatever situation.
yes there is a way
Good Luck! Automate the boring stuff really saved my life and broadened my horizon with automation and what possibilities and things I can do with python, its a free book as well so for sure check that out if you are ever feeling stuck or looking for things to do! 
Black is a good example project to look at. https://github.com/ambv/black Another project I am working on aims to generate a starting point for new packages with best practices. Right now it only supports setup.py but I plan to add options for poetry, pipenv, etc. https://github.com/cs01/create-python-package
Coming in from C# into Python, so I’ll be reviewing some tutorials. 
Some good advice, but I don't recall ever seeing Hungarian notation used in Python. It's common practice in the C world, but Python's ore dynamic / duck typed nature makes it redundant. Especially if you making use of typing annotations.
curl &lt;gist_raw_address&gt; | python You’ll need to go to GitHub and get the Raw file URL. GitLab is much nicer as you only need to add `/raw` to the URL.

the FAQ merely points to the SOPython article lol.
Not sure if this would help with your problem, but have you tried Data Camp? They have courses on Python but idk if they have any on python networking. 
It covers a subset of the same stuff and links to it, yep. Figured it would be better to link to something more closely associated with the subreddit in addition, since that's where I learned about it.

I get horrible cell service at work and can never get pictures and videos that my wife sends me of our son. So I'm using Flask to build a pseudo-Instagram for us to share photos since I'll be able to access that.
In early, early Python you couldn’t inherit from dict so they had a separate dict class thingie (I forget the name of the class). In current Python, you can use `__slots__` to define attributes as a pseudo tuple instead of a class instance dict. But your point stands. 
I just got [Foundations of Python Network Programming](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/1430258543/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04__o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) and so far it's been pretty good. 
This is /r/python not /r/learnpython. Wrong sub.
Would the subject of python's popularity fit more into a forum regarding the language itself or the pursuit of learning the language? I personally feel this is the right sub, but what do I know? I generally see questions being posed in this thread and agree they're geared towards /r/learningpython but I don't see a question being asked here.
Ah Zed A Shaw, what a peaceful, charming and relaxing way to learn how to code. 
The book is so awesome that I try to leave a positive feedback every time I see it getting mentioned. Also, Al's Automate the Boring Stuff should be the next in line.
ROFL, that's the first time I've seen this. This is gold!
the FAQ is largely nitpicky and largely unconvincing though. i was hoping to read some REAL MEAT, perhaps from an expert on writing educational material about why LPTHW is awful. I'm assuming the authors of this are the SO community, hardly experts. My 19yo kid read it and got by fine. It wasn't the only resource but it was one of them and she got through it fine. She learned to program into python, not in python.
Enjoy he's a bit of a nutter. Haha. 
this belongs in /r/learnpython , straight up karma farming.
I’m learning python through Kaggle’s resources, and am attempting last week’s r/dailyprogrammer easy challenge.
The post is about subreddits that begin with "/r/learn". It's about /r/learnpython, /r/learndota2, /r/learnpolish, etc.
Precisely why I linked to the experts. :P As I said earlier, there are some people that will get on fine with it. In my experience of helping out beginners though, most of them do just end up confused or annoyed with it. And besides, "Google this thing" isn't the greatest thing to read over and over when you buy some learning material. That's just lazy. 
I'm currently transitioning a small Jupyter project from Pandas+msgpack to Dask+Parquet (Parquet was originally out of necessity since Dask doesn't do msgpack, but I'm not looking back -- the combination of these two is _scary_ fast). N.b. Dask has some patterns that are a bit different than Pandas given that it's deferred-centric, although a lot of the core API (and especially `loc` and other selector/aggregator functions) are the same.
Is there any sense in pointing out that Python does not have variables, it has names?
What experts? 
The SO community - say what you will about SO in general, but there are some seriously knowledgeable people over there
&gt; `if-else` approach does not scale and is not practical. agreed. However, I would wager your `USTreasuryBond` example could be written with plain python objects with properties. And then the dependency graph is implicitly created by properties requesting properties requesting properties. 
Knowledgeable in programming doesn't make you knowledgeable in how to teach programming. 
As I've said previously I wouldn't touch anything from Zed Shaw with a 100ft long barge pole whilst wearing disinfected gloves. Rationale, he slagged off python 3 some years back, then realised that he was losing money so promptly put out his crap book targetted at Python 3. Bloody hypocrite :-(
