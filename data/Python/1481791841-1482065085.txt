Not really. In most cases I just downloaded it, installed it and it works. There is no time needed to understand it. All I did was compile the python source. But that's fair, okay, I see the argument. &gt; it also requires a download THIS, though, is embarrassing. Python programmers aren't idiots. Your POV makes no sense at all. There's no python programmer out there who isn't at least a bit of a "technical user". They're programmers. You're insulting the people who you want to use your "product".

You can use those tutorials as well. Just keep in mind main differences between Py2 and Py3. But you don't need to remember whole list. First of all: * The `print` statement has been replaced with a `print()` function * Python 3 uses the concepts of text and (binary) data instead of Unicode strings and 8-bit strings * PEP 0238: An expression like `1/2` returns a float. Use `1//2` to get the truncating behavior. https://docs.python.org/3.1/whatsnew/3.0.html

IANAL, ask your layer these questions instead, but: Apache is perfectly fine for open source projects. I believe people who ask someone to release their source code under MIT is doing so because they think it's the most popular permissive license(s), and it's both better than no license (code is still copyrighted without a license, even if it is on github) and there are some legal gray areas when it comes to giving it out as public domain. Read about licenses in plain english here: https://tldrlegal.com/

*Minor Spoilers for War Dogs ahead There is a scene in War Dogs where one of the main characters is explaining to his partner how he checks a particular website each day for new government contracts/orders. Both characters are then seen checking this website day and night while bidding on order requests. Later on when they decide to expand he hires a team of salespeople whose main job is to comb this website each day for orders that meet a specific criteria and then bid on those projects. During all of that I was just thinking how he could have just hired a developer to build a web scraper and automation tool to achieve the same goal.

I'd recommend ["Awesome Python" @ LibHunt](https://python.libhunt.com/), too. It has all listings from the mentioned list + some additional ones. Moreover, you can sort packages by popularity or dev activity as well as compare them side by side.

I need to load a DLL, have it do some processing for me, and then delete the DLL from disk, all from within python.
It depends on the book I guess. If the book is super focused on getting you to build something specific without any extra fluff then I'd say go ahead and read end to end. If not and it tries to be too encyclopedic then that's when I'd say reading cover to cover AT THE BEGINNING is not the most efficient way to gain the actionable knowledge you need.

This is a very odd use-case and suggests that there maybe a more straightforward way to accomplish it if you rethink your approach. Nevertheless if your DLL has a C API (which I assume it does if you're planning on calling it from Python) then it is fairly straightforward to accomplish this through `ctypes` using `LoadLibrary` and `FreeLibrary` from the Win32 API. Docs for those functions can be found [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682599.aspx). See [this Stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13128995/ctypes-unload-dll) that roughly describes the required approach. As noted in the comments you should ensure the type of `ctypes` DLL that you use matches the calling conventions of the loaded DLL.

Yup! Maybe not *exactly* what you were looking for but it's based off a movie :P (Jurassic Park. The "Uh uh uh, you didn't say the magic word!" part) Either `raise YouDidntSayTheMagicWord` in your own program. Or you can run wht_rbt.obj from the command line (or start menu if you use the windows installer route) to get the prompt like from the movie.

is this the existing version you mention: https://github.com/dropbox/python-zxcvbn? it's great, that you worked on this and chose to release the code for others to use, thank you! i am wondering though why you did not fork the original or provide patches?
it is. there were several pending pull requests to modernize the library that had no responses. also, this version had been modeled after 1.0 of the javascript version, which was different enough that i would have had to scrap most of it anyways. it was easier for me and also a better exercise for me to start from scratch.

not so good...
PyCharm can also use IPython in the console which pretty prints automatically for you. You just have to pip install IPython (for whichever interpreter your project uses, system or virtualenv) and ensure that the setting `Use IPython if available` is checked. You can just open settings and search for IPython or go to `Settings -&gt; Build, Execution, Deployment -&gt; Console`. Example: In[23]: {a: chr(a) for a in range(10)} Out[23]: {0: '\x00', 1: '\x01', 2: '\x02', 3: '\x03', 4: '\x04', 5: '\x05', 6: '\x06', 7: '\x07', 8: '\x08', 9: '\t'} 
Perhaps you can run the code that uses the DLL in a subprocess that will terminate once done its thing, then the parent process can delete the DLL.

Very nice, always great to try out libraries/APIs by scratching an itch you have. My suggestions for the next features revolve making it more frictionless to the user: 1. Have a default environmental variable, or serialized dot-file, that a user can optionally configure so that they don't have to re-authenticate everytime they use your program. [Ruby's t](https://github.com/sferik/t) (command-line twitter) and [aws-cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) do this very well. 2. Use [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html), or something similar like [click](http://click.pocoo.org/5/), to create a command-line interface for your tool, which would largely eliminate the need for an interactive prompt. Again, check out t and awscli as examples, but this would be the ideal interaction for a user using your tool more than once: $ redditsavesearch "my sharona"

Fine if they want to reduce their long term programmer productivity for short term gains, but then who cares about one organisation discarding Python when so many others are taking it up?
How about answering both questions? What has the infrastructure got to do with differences between Python 2 and 3?
Is it possible to do something like this in `f` notation: &gt;&gt;&gt; things = get_things() &gt;&gt;&gt; "peter likes {count} things".format(count=len(schafe)) Or i need a to define a new variable `count` for that? Or is the `f` notation just a lazy way of doing: &gt;&gt;&gt; things = get_things() &gt;&gt;&gt; count = len(things) &gt;&gt;&gt; "peter likes {count} things".format(**locals())

Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython. We **highly encourage** you to re-submit your post over on there. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is more-so dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community can get disenchanted with seeing the 'same, repetitive newbie' questions repeated on the sub, so you may not get the best responses over here. However, on /r/LearnPython the community is actively expecting questions from new members, and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. Whatever your question happens to be getting help with Python, you should get good answers. If you have a question to do with homework or an assignment of any kind, please make sure to read their sidebar rules **before** submitting your post. If you have any questions or doubts, feel free to reply or send a modmail to us with your concerns. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!

I disagree with most (but not all) of this article, more specifically the five "mistakes". The very premise of trying "not to waste time" is a problem. Learning programming takes a long time. There are no short cuts. Sure, you can gulp down the basics in a week or so, but after that you won't know programming. You'll just know how to crap out some code that somehow mostly solves a certain problem. That's like someone who wants to become a novel author and just learned the rules of grammar. I very much recommend a different article as an excellent read for a more conservative point of view: [**Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years**](http://norvig.com/21-days.html) Now, about those mistakes. **Reading a book cover to cover.** Is something I absolutely recommend to someone who is learning their very first language (by themselves). A *thick* book. At the same time they should absolutely play around to try things out, which does not require a plan. When they've read the book they should *read it again*. Of course the assumption is that it's a good book with some sort of structure, illustrative examples and readable prose. It goes without saying that after the first read they won't retain most of what the book contains. That's fine. What they will have gained is a full overview of *what exists*. Even if they don't understand most of a chapter on language feature X they will at least get a vague idea of what it's about and where that knowledge will be useful. The very first read of a book on programming is not meant to teach them everything at once, it's so they can find out what lies ahead of them. With that overview they can then make an informed decision about what they want to take a closer look at. **Diving in without a plan.** I'm not quite sure what that refers to. I'm a huge fan of tiny pet projects and I believe (or hope) that most programmers have those. For those first few projects pretty much anything will do. They should be something you can develop a bit of passion about and actually use in some way. Python is particularly great at writing handy little tools to ease various every day tasks. **Failing to narrow your scope.** That one bugs me the most. Narrowing your scope is quite literally the worst thing a newbie can do in any subject. It leads directly to that scenario where the only tool you know is a hammer and you're using that to shear the hedge and paint the walls. Sure, you can't learn everything at the same time. Don't put threads, networking and system calls all at once into your very first project. But at the same time, always keep your eyes open and expand your knowledge on *what exist*. And when you find something cool and interesting that you think might be useful somewhere, try it! A while back I wrote a tiny command line utility for which I learned how to use curses. I already knew threads so I used those for my UI. Then I learned about asyncio, so I rewrote the thing and threw out the threads. Later I learned about generators and rewrote half the code again. Having a few pet projects like that which you can rewrite completely on a whim to try out something new is incredibly valuable. And it works at any scale! Even when you've just learned the while-loop after you've previously been using for-loops for everything you can go over your existing code and try to apply the new knowledge. Never make the mistake of thinking "I already know one way to deal with this problem so I won't bother learning another". **Trying to learn 2 (or more) things at the same time.** I'd narrow this one down. *First* you learn the language. *Then* you learn how to use anything already written in that language. The first three projects you work on should be tiny and entirely your own code (standard library is the limit). Everything else makes it extremely difficult to understand which code is language specific and which code is unique to that particular framework/library. (One of the most heinous crimes of people on StackOverflow is recommending jQuery to complete beginners in JavaScript) **Spending too much time studying before you have experience doing.** This one I mostly agree with. You can't skip the theory altogether but until you have an actual use case for something there's no point of hammering it into your head. Wait until you have a scenario where the given feature appears to be a plausible solution, then start learning about it and try to apply it. At that point in time however, you *should* actually spend a little time to read about it, and not just the one paragraph that tells you the solution to the problem at hand. Make sure you understand the scope of the feature, i.e. what it can do beyond your particular use case. And make sure you understand *how* it does what it does. Anyway those are my thoughts on those "mistakes". Your mileage may vary. ^(edited some phrasing)

My overall impression of Reddit ads is they kind of suck and don't provide enough return for the cost (especially had I been advertising on a larger subreddit). The article I linked on the second blog post (https://blog.ladder.io/reddit-ads/) really covers everything regarding how I feel about them. It comes down to not really being worth it because Reddit users just (understandably) hate ads so much. It doesn't make sense to advertise via Reddit when you can try to get organic views via posts and your money is better spent with more accurately targeted ads in locations that are more receptive to advertising. I targeted my ads as precisely as you realistically could on Reddit to ensure the ad was relevant to those who would see it, and I still didn't get a single lead or sale.
For example: transition when installing software in production machines. In a 100K+ people organization with hundreds of projects, you don't want to wait for all Python projects to test with new version before rolling a change (changing to Python 3.x). And having two coexisting versions is not an option.

They are, but not those specific versions. You have to run `conda update pandas` to get the versions that have come out since Anaconda 4.2.

That's true, but the problem then becomes updating the script as versions change. Since these are rather stable toolchains, there probably isn't enough advantage in tracking -current to justify the maintenance cost. That might be because I'm fundamentally a lazy cuss. That being said, I did discover some cool libraries from your script so I'm glad I took the time to read it.

dude, that's the better pattern to use. Go for it. But I would change that to a tuple or a set. A set is great for checking membership quickly (large collections this is best) and tuples are great at representing an ordered collection of items and that collection isn't going to be modified (you don't append/remove from a tuple). If you have ['bar', 'baz'] and it will always be hardcoded as those two, I'd use a tuple. But personally I'd remove that ", " at the end of ['bar', 'baz', ]. If each item is on a new line, I use a comma even for the last element. If not, no reason.

What's the exact syntax error message?
Damn, just learned about this one... I used to use fabric for some simple scripts to do some remote stuff but now I think I'll just use plumbum. Sometimes all I need to do is download some update and restart a service, but on ten machines. This is perfect for the one-offs.
I somewhat like this but think it creates a new wart in python, worse perhaps than one item tuples. `{'hello'}` is a one item set. `{}` is not an empty set but a *completely different data structure*. I think it's nice on its own, but damn does it create a new horrible situation. Edit - tuples are worse than I thought. `(1)` is not a tuple, which I knew, but `()` is an empty tuple. :|
You need four spaces at the start of each line to properly format code.
&gt; I have no idea why the site formatted the source I posted like that Because [you need to indent code blocks by four spaces on Reddit to preserve the formatting](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/commenting). By default, single line breaks are not preserved. I suggest that you fix the formatting and repost this in /r/learnpython. *Edit:* better still, in future use a [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/) for long pieces of code instead of pasting it all inline. You won't need to do any additional indentation, and you'll have the option of syntax highlighting.
Yeah, for things that don't change during the runtime of the program, globals are fine. It's considered idiomatic to name constants in `ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES`.
&gt; ========='''.''' There's your problem. Line 81, should be a comma. Look at getting your code into some kind of version control so you can easily see what you've actually changed each step. Edit, also look at running the code yourself and see what error message you get from python. It would have got you a lot closer to the actual problem. Remember, the actual mistake may be at some point *before* where it's pointed out. File "test.py", line 89 =========, ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax

If I understand right, you subclass not just ValueError, but also FrobnitzError, so it's FrobnitzValueError(ValueError, FrobnitzError). This way, people using your library can just catch FrobnitzError as a catch-all for any errors bubbling up from your library.
Nor crazy not genius. I gave similar talks in PyconLT this and last year. This is where devops is going to, and trying to bring developers along.

Since you seem to know about this topic, would you mind if I asked you a few questions? What storage method would one use for the immutable logs? Is it still a good idea to keep a database in one of the microservices? Would other microservices just subscribe to those changes? Or how would I transfer keep a record of users for example
I will also give this a shot but I have a few questions. Do you happen to know someplace I could find more info? 
The above example is fine (a tuple is probably preferred over a list, but thats a minor concern). However DO NOT: `if foo in ('bar', expensive_slow_function_that_returns_baz()):`
Celery is a great interface for this sort of thing. If either I don't need the result immediately or there is a natural way to break a large problem up into several small bits that different workers can execute I'll consider using celery. Celery doesn't help with the importing issue afaik, but will allow you to scale different pieces of a pipeline. The complexity added is significant though, so be prepared to worry about queues getting backed up / tasks not running / rigging together your own priority system. Also all meta tasks like |, group, ... run on the default queue unless told otherwise and that can easily prevent them from ever being completed.
Also working on PEP-526 type annotations. Starting with a few small scripts. Also just learned about vulture for doing dead code checking. Ran on a few scripts and so far it has found a few minor clean-ups for me.
Ugh what we need another tutorial that teaches the controversy. :)
Because this line...: catdog[i] = [(x+y) for x,y in zip(catdog[i],amountOfYears)] ...creates a new list as the `i`-th element of `catdog` (i.e. `stuff`).
&gt; it's the comma that makes the tuple exactly
&gt; It's probably better not to rely on mutation, though. I totally concur.
Worth watching! Great wrap up of how Python dictionaries evolved and what's in Python 3.6.
I've written medium scale applications using a pubsub model for passing data between different parts of the application, and my problem is always that it's hard to know exactly what needs to be published and against which topic. If you're going to take this approach it's very important to ensure that your messages are well structured. This means having a data structure for each that can serialize/deserialize itself, and having a function/method for sending that message. You really don't want a bunch of calls that look like pubsub.send_message( "foobar", { "field1": 1, "field2": 2, "nested": { "complex": "data", "is": "hard", "to": "keep", "well": "organized" } } ) Instead, it's much better to have send_foobar( FooBar( field1=1, field2=2, nested=Nested( complex="data", is="hard", to="keep", well="organized" ) ) ) It seems like a minor difference at first, but it scales better. When you have dozens or hundreds of messages to pass around having this auto-completed, statically verified, type checked, documented, and IDE friendly helps you and your coworkers. Refactoring is now possible, whereas before you could only grep. Another benefit is that you can now write small wrappers to allow you to do: subscribe(FooBar, foobar_handler) completely ridding your code of bare strings. Don't use strings, use names.
Yeah this is definitely something I would say.
You'll need to have some knowledge of linear algebra, specifically matrix multiplication
This makes an important point: people say "Use Python 3 unless your requirements need Python 2", but I rarely know exactly what I'll need when I start a project. And if I want to use *X* but it requires Python 2, is there a good alternative that supports Python 3, or am I making more work for myself by giving up *X*? I think the proposed solution (support both until a dependency pushes you one way) is OK for experienced Python developers who are already comfortable writing compatible code. But it's more effort for people newer to Python, and it prevents you from using any of the new features in Python 3. I'd like to think we're reaching the point in the transition where someone could start a list of packages which still require Python 2, and the best alternatives to them for Python 3 support. The list would need to be short enough that people are willing to look through it when starting a project, but comprehensive enough to give people confidence.
Oh, you mean like everything Microsoft for the past year+, or every Android release since 4.4.x? Wish the right people would think like this...
Maybe you can modify user env changing install script Se [my example](https://github.com/hugosenari/cookiecutter-kupfer-plugin-package/blob/master/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.project_slug%7D%7D/setup.py) maybe give you some insight.
I think you'd have to focus on the relatively popular packages - if you try to cover all the niches, the list is going to be too long for people to scan through it. As a start, maybe take the 19 of 360 packages which are not yet green on http://py3readiness.org/ ? Alternatively, if there's a particular niche you know, you could build the list focussed on that niche.
&gt; Or, you know, don't add {} and () as a constructor Fail. [], {} and () are literals. A literal is a huge shortcut compared to the constructor, which involves lookups, has to be generic and able to process arguments to choose the correct course of action depending on their form, etc. `set` is truly shit out of luck. $ time python3 -c 'for _ in range(10000000): tuple()' real 0m2.019s user 0m2.016s sys 0m0.004s $ time python3 -c 'for _ in range(10000000): ()' real 0m0.672s user 0m0.668s sys 0m0.004s &gt; Commas do not define a tuple. That you can define a tuple without parentheses (but not an empty tuple) is another inconsistency. Commas do define a tuple, empty tuple is kinda different. Parens have a support role and are used for disambiguation. And good fucking luck destroying the ease of use of the indispensable tuple unpacking, you know that very thing that allows you to assign multiple things at once, because it's not elegant enough for your taste. 
[iapws]( https://pypi.python.org/pypi/iapws/1.1.3): Python implementation of standards from The InternationalAssociation for the Properties of Water and Steam 
&gt; To be honest, justifying this by saying that python doesn't recognise that tuple() and () mean the same thing is hardly a good thing! does the term "dynamic language" ring any bells? &gt;&gt;&gt; tuple = set &gt;&gt;&gt; tuple([1,2,3]) {1, 2, 3} all the language can do with something() is to extract the identifier, make a lookup for it and call it. No shortcuts possible.

&gt; I don't want them to be highly dynamic, they are highly dynamic. Well they're not, are they? Because you're simultaneously arguing for a dynamic form *and* a completely untouchable way of creating things. But only some things, of course. I'm not saying I don't like python, ffs, I work with it every day. But this is a part of the language that's awkward because it breaks at least two of the key things that to me make something "pythonic". They're surprising, since () == tuple() most of the time but sometimes not if someone has redefined what a tuple means so now my code might do something highly different by me replacing one for the other despite you describing it as "shortcut". It's not a shortcut, because it actually means something importantly different! There are several ways of defining a tuple, some of which are identical in meaning but can't exist in different places. `1,` means a tuple of length 1, and passing a variable set to that into `list()` creates a list of one item. Calling `list(1,)` doesn't work however, because now it ignores the comma then complains the 1 isn't iterable. `[1,]` does work though. `[]` and `list()` do different things with their contents. Create a list with a single tuple with a single item: `list(((1,),))` &gt; "literals are performant and/or a nice, compact, convenient shortcut" is not enough of a justification for their existence? They are not a shortcut. They actually mean something different, as you point out. I can't drop `()` in wherever I would otherwise put `tuple()`. &gt; Who and based on what criteria decides which default identifiers are untouchable? what about frozenset? OrderedDict? Count? Do they have untouchable other identifiers?
Seems fairly normal to me, Kafka and some kind of *mq achieve this very nicely.. I'm lucky to be in a project right now where we're heavy in data analytics using kubernetes, go and python so much fun and learning being had as we hook up all the services! (I'm the devops weirdo) The whole MSA thing isn't new if you know Unix.... it's just that the processes and buses are not on the same logical computer anymore. Every process/service has one task.. (and should do it well) ideally lol.. and keep state away from your processes where possible What might have been a logfile could now be a data store, what might have been a Unix socket is just an API, IPC stuff is now something like gRPC, etc.. Pipe them together and blammo! Not to over simplify, it is complex and distributed debug is it's own art form. I think that's what's scares people the most...

Good points. However, I'd like some discussion: * interface versioning - make new channels for each new MAJOR version. * undocumented interface behavioral changes - that applies to all interfaces in general, not a relevant point. * inefficiency - what would be the real loss of time using 0MQ or nanomsg? In the chain of 10 microservices there are 9 additional cpu interrupts and network stack traversals. With 20gbits lines in datacenters that shouldnt amount to significance. * increased long term development costs - this too applies to every software development in general, even moreso to monolithic apps, not really relevant. * managing dependencies - this, afaik, is the place for someone to become a star and provide solutions. API/message schemas stored and autoprovisioned by deployment service? XML revisited? :) * increased complexity - complexity increases with the amount of features, in both: monolithic and microservices. Integration tests are about testing set of apps setupped in operational order, with simulated points of failure, not about testing all possible combinations. Complexity (features) increases development costs, but that is how reality works, nothing wrong with that. Yes that requires testing, and introduces potential bugs. So this point is irrelevant.
Like POTUS said, I suggest just using Requests library. payload = {'user_name': username, 'user_pass': password, 'remember_me': '1', 'login': 'login' } response = session.post('loginURL', payload).content Login with your browser with the F12 dev console open. Check out the parameters and the loginURL you post to. Parameters on the left of the dict, credentials and other required literals you might need on the right. Read back the .content of the post and you can check the response for errors like if "invalid username or password" in str(responseSource): This will take you a little bit of work to figure out the inner workings of the site you want to scrape, F12 browser dev menu and a notepad to document your findings is your first job.
If you want to regularly remove old files (in this case older than 90 days), you could just add this to your crontab: 30 12 * * * find /path/to/downloads/ -mtime +90 -exec rm -rf "{}" \;
&gt; In addition, all of our server vms have a native Python 2.x install, and I get a withering gaze from ops if I inquire about installing/upgrading/migrating to Python 3.x. Sounds like your ops guys are behind on the times on app deployment processes. They could containerize it, or use virtualenv , or one of a few other ways of getting python 3 onto a VM that already has python 2 - without breaking anything.
&gt; Because you're simultaneously arguing for a dynamic form and a completely untouchable way of creating things. I am only describing the status quo: literals set in stone because they are syntax, identifiers not set in stone because they are not syntax. Dynamic python is dynamic but not absolutely dynamic. &gt; But this is a part of the language that's awkward because it breaks at least two of the key things that to me make something "pythonic". they are "pythonic" by definition, because python is defined by its syntactic rules. &gt; They are not a shortcut. They are a shortcut/optimization to calling the class constructor via its current handle (feel free to decompile shit to see the bytecode for yourself) &gt; Do they have untouchable other identifiers?

I recommend using namedtuples as a base for this. 
You certainly can, it's an easy solution in python, but I think the concept holds regardless of the language. Use named structs with documented fields and separate functions for publishing that are also nicely documented. It makes a world of difference.
I don't believe that there is a way to unload a shared library directly in python. I did just search through the docs again out of curiosity, but I couldn't come up with anything. I found some claims that this would be very hard to support in general. Presumably this is due to the fact that python's shared library import machinery supports many platforms and that each platform has its own idiosyncrasies. One option would be to write your own shared library lifecycle code and then wrap that in python using the C api. I'm not familiar with windows, but what I would personally do is use the linux dlopen api to accomplish this. Of course to make this work correctly, you'd probably have to both understand the shared library life cycle as well as the python life cycle quite well. It's not unreasonable, but would certainly require care. As an aside, the responses in this thread are a bit disconcerting. This is a very reasonable question to ask and I remember being confused about it myself in the past. Maybe most people are unfamiliar with the fact that you can dynamically load and unload compiled C/C++/Fortran/etc. code on modern platforms. In fact, this is how python implements its loading of compiled extension modules...it just apparently does not implement the unloading as far as I know. Not sure if that helps, but good luck. edit: Apparently I'm blind and didn't notice that this comment already said what I did (even better since it explicitly referenced the Windows api): https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/5ii1pt/unloading_a_dll_in_python_35/db8g77h/
Thanks.
No. To my understanding there are still some things in the default install (and many more packages one installs). Also, Python 2 should absolutely not conflict with Python 3, so uninstalling it won't do anything (and visa-versa). If you post on /r/learnpython with the issues you are getting people can probably help you there. (or in a comment here I suppose).
meh, one can install pip toys to $HOME and not touch the system files at all. pip3 install --user whatever And that's assuming that the prepackaged modules are not sufficient. Most classic modules are available as python3-name in apt-get Granted, greater separation is nice if you are serious about devwork and deployment, but if you are only dabbling, default python2/python3 packages are perfectly fine.
don't even think about it. That said, python2 and python3 versions exist in parallel and there is no reason to even be bothered by this. if you need a module run `apt-cache search python3-*` to see what's there sudo apt-get install python3-matplotlib If you need something that is not in the repository (eg you need a newer version of X because there is a bug in the repo version), **don't `sudo pip3 install` it**, do this instead pip3 install --user packagename it will install to your $HOME without jeopardizing the integrity of system files. And if you want to make python3 .py creation easy, create a file in your Templates directory named `Python3 file.py`, put `#!/usr/bin/env python3` in the first line, save it and make it executable in file properties/by chmod-ding u+x it. From now on you can create python files via rightclick context menu, New file and given the executable bit, they can be now run as `./progname.py`. The correct version of python will be picked according to the hashbang line.
Use Anaconda .... It will save you a lot of headache especially if you work on the sceintific stack like numpy, scipy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, etc. Don't mess with your system python.
Sure, ask me anything, I'm also one of the core devs of the mantl.io project. &gt; What storage method would one use for the immutable logs? Most clients have already running infrastructure. Kafka is popular, along with Logstash and Elasticsearch (or Splunk for the rich) &gt; Is it still a good idea to keep a database in one of the microservices? As long as the filesystem for the data is distributed, or shared with all the nodes running the database in some other way - sure. However, the problems that you'd expect will appear in the least expected places, i.e.: docker deamon failing if glusterfs filesystem used by container is remounted during runtime. More and more of these sorts of incompatibilities are resolved and fixed. &gt; Would other microservices just subscribe to those changes? Or how would I transfer keep a record of users for example What was the last question about?
The python you use for python work should not be the system python. Don't touch the system's python.
Sort by insertion order, I mean.

implementation detail, so for the time being OrderedDict should be used (even if internally it's just a thin wrapper around dict), if only for the backwards compatibility with ≤ 3.5 At this point in time the spec actually guarantees: - order of keyword arguments - order of attributes within a class including the dict order in the spec will possibly happen 1 or 2 point releases down the road, once it gets battle tested in these 2 much less visited areas.
&gt;It makes it faster, turns out It makes them faster compared to the previous version in the current C (and PyPy) implementation, but the OP was asking about being a requirement for *any* python implementation. That it's better now compared to what was there before doesn't mean there will never be reasons / future implementations that are faster again (or have some other reason for using them), but don't preserve ordering, and so guaranteeing this does restrict it for alternate / future implementations. For instance, take the java or c# implementations of python - it makes a lot of sense for these to use the underlying hashtable implentations of the Java/c# runtime for dictionaries, thus taking advantage of all the infrastructure around this , but these do **not** (AFAIK) guarantee order, so this would not actually be an option for those implementations - instead they'd have to roll their own, and this would likely *reduce* performance, since they become more opaque to the runtime / GC etc. That's not to say that it might not be worth it. Eg. a similar thing happened with sorting - python's builtin sort algorithm happens to be *stable* (meaning equal items won't move place). This is a sometimes useful property, but often irrelevant, much like ordering on dicts, but in that case python did end up deciding to make stability part of the API guarantees.
Sure. But it seems not a super big concern to me. I mean, in those cases where you needed the speed you could just use SuperFastDict like you have to use OrderedDict in older python versions right?
By default I use Python 3 when starting out new things. Most of the time this worked without trouble. When things go wrong, I check if I can port the component which causes trouble. Often that's possible with a reasonable amount of efforts, then I just go for it. Existing larger codebases are a whole different story though. Even if it may be feasible to port them over to Python 3 with reasonable efforts, there is usually also a somewhat social implication to it, like ops groups, people being afraid of switching Py2 to Py3 etc. 
But speed always helps a program. Ordered dicts are only useful in a few, not every program needs it.
I think you are over stating the importance of small speed improvements and under selling ordered dicts. Ordering helps many things like testing as a side effect. The usefulness isn't obvious until after the transition. 
I understand this was a programming exercise, and as others have said, it could be easily replaced with very simple shell aliases. Regardless, if you want to improve your program as a learning exercise, you may want to try to use XDG User Directories (see [here](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/xdg-user-dirs/) and [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG_user_directories) to find the path of the downloads dir, which may or may not be `~/Downloads`, depending on system locale and user configuration.
&gt;The ordered one is faster (and takes less ram) NOW. That's a reason for *using* it, it isn't a reason for making that guarantee. It'll be just as fast if you *don't* make order mandatory in the API - the only thing that'll affect is whether you can rely on order (and even then, there's nothing stopping you making ordereddict essentially a change-nothing subclass of the current implementation so you get all the benefits without potentially hamstringing future changes - ie if you need to change, you can keep ordereddict the same, but change the implementation of dict) Suppose it were the other way round, and this more performant one broke ordering and the previous way preserved it. If we'd guaranteed ordering, it would mean we'd never be able to switch - I think that'd be a disadvantage: order preservation isn't needed that often, and so it's reasonable to use a specific subclass when you need it. Coupling these features so tightly just because the current implementation is the best we currently have could potentially limit you in future. And like I said, there **are** implementations that exist NOW where this could indeed be a downgrade in performance. Eg. jython and IronPython which, unsurprisingly, piggyback on the underlying hashtables of their relevant platforms. Those implementations are not ordered, and so to maintain compatibility, they'd need to roll their own implementations, which'll likely be slower even with this optimisation, because they're not implemented on the lower level of the platform implementation. Worse, now anything that comes through the platform that you present as a dict needs to now be copied and mirrored *just in case* someone's relying on order preservation of it. That could be a **big** performance hit, so more likely you'll instead just end up breaking this guarantee for such objects and end up with inconsistent dict behaviour depending on what created the dict.
"Do I require a Turing-complete solution?" "Do I want to have to rewrite this code in a couple years?" "Should I install my code on a Win2k3 server or Win2016 one?"
&gt; I am only describing the status quo: I fully understand the current setup. If all you are trying to do is explain that things are the way they are then this is an even larger waste of time than it otherwise seems to be. I am simply arguing that these things are *ugly* because they create special cases in both syntax and implementation. &gt; they are "pythonic" by definition, because python is defined by its syntactic rules. I'm talking about PEP-20. There are several lines in it which I think are crossed by these rules. &gt; They are a shortcut/optimization to calling the class constructor via its current handle (feel free to decompile shit to see the bytecode for yourself) Again though, they don't mean the same thing. `()` is not a shortcut for `tuple()`, the two are not necessarily interchangeable. They are *almost always* interchangeable, but not always. I don't think you can describe one as a shortcut for the other if they don't necessarily do the same thing. &gt; No they don't. I think you missed my point here. Some things, like dicts, have two ways of creating them. One untouchable. If you think asking "which ones should be untouchable" is a hard question to answer, why isn't "which ones should have another way of writing which is untouchable"?
This has nothing to do with tkinter, it's just the way you should handle both booleans. Replace your ``select_ping`` function with something like this: def select_ping(): if var1.get(): os.system("ping www.google.com") if var2.get(): os.system("ping www.yahoo.com") if both checkboxes are set, both pings will be done because one simply follows the other.
Started with a web page scraper for product price analysis for a studying project. First time for me using python but I am pretty impressed. Works like a charm together with a MySQL database. 
The bug was present in earlier versions as well, see the issue: https://bugs.python.org/issue28147 The new dict implementation just made the existing bug more obvious.
&gt; Ordering helps many things like testing as a side effect. How? Is the current dict not deterministic?
I use both windows and Android (I have a nexus, so it's always the most recent version). I've never had a problem with updates from either.
Playing devil's advocate here, why would someone like me start using a new cli libraly like yours instead of an stablished one like [docopt](http://docopt.org/) ?
Oh wow...I didn't realise this was an issue, I mean it makes sense, but I just never connected the two.
If this is your blog, there's an error in the second code block. Your `log_and_time` function takes two arguments but you call it with one (`log_and_time(gather_comments)`)

Nice list ! You miss Dogelang and Hask though :) https://github.com/vindarel/languages-that-compile-to-python (Hask is in an issue https://github.com/billpmurphy/hask).
I did put in some effort to look for similar projects before I started defopt, but it turns out I missed quite a lot of them, including Clize. It looks like the author [has plans to handle standard docstring formats](https://github.com/epsy/clize/issues/15) too. Perhaps if Clize ends up having a superset of defopt's functionality I can retire it. There's another similar project called [begins](http://begins.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which doesn't require you to write the `__main__` bit. The problem with that is the main function gets called immediately after it's defined, meaning any code below it hasn't been run yet. Ultimately I decided that was a little *too* magical and error-prone.
Librairies &gt; Libraries
it's a github repo, why not send a pull request?
so have you tried ?
are the header lines identical in all the files ? 
Ah yes, good call on me missing that. Thanks.
Gross. :( I feel like drinking already 
why ?
You may find my library [thermo](https://github.com/CalebBell/thermo) useful. With it, you can obtain properties as easily as &gt;&gt;&gt; from thermo import Chemical &gt;&gt;&gt; Chemical('hexane', T=298.15, P=1E5).rho 654.7775851886926 &gt;&gt;&gt; Mixture(['decane', 'furfuryl alcohol'], ws=[0.5, 0.5], T=350, P=1E6).Cp 2334.4087305332255 You may also be interested in my fluid dynamics or heat transfer libraries, [fluids](https://github.com/CalebBell/fluids) and [ht](https://github.com/CalebBell/ht).
toolz is amazing. So clever, so concise, and so pythonic. Reading the source has made my own code better, even without using the library.
Ish. It's just deterministic in annoying ways :P
It's a trade off to be sure. A risk/chance of future revolution VS's tangible benefits right now. I ascribe lower risk than you (or am more risk averse) and higher benefits. 
'cause first, I open a discussion, then I go see some friends. 
Thanks for pointing out this presentation. This is really a great talk about Python dictionaries. Now it makes also sense why hash functions are such a big thing in computer science.
I use both Windows, and Linux for Desktop/Servers, and Android for mobile. Windows is a mess with a lot of things, I'm not going to go into further detail, it's not necessary. For Android, remember what happened with Lollipop
Such software obviously should fix their shebang. See PEP 394: &gt; `python` should be used in the shebang line only for scripts that are source compatible with both Python 2 and 3. &gt; in preparation for an eventual change in the default version of Python, Python 2 only scripts should either be updated to be source compatible with Python 3 or else to use `python2` in the shebang line.
hmm it should be something fun like a mini game or make a programm which use a photo of her and it make it pixel like. Think about something funny.
Nice, trying to learn ~~Go~~ Haskell right now and I'm having trouble structuring my code. Maybe this'll help me learn functional program design. 
What happens when you run `python` in the command prompt?
Data aggregators are fun, there are a ton of quick and dirty recommender systems and neural nets you can extend to produce things like "Things my sister might say" or suggestions for hobbies she might be into (ex: I'm writing a knitting pattern recommender for a sister for Christmas)
That's pretty cool. I never used markovify before. I am playing around with some social media tools. Mainly with Twitter now, but an looking to play around with some projects that do some sort of logic around text. Lmk if you post it on GitHub. I'll follow it. That's interesting that it chose those sentences to put together. Was that just random or did it see a connection between warning shot and bullet necklace?
That's the part I can't figure out. It is not found
 pip install pyperclip
Nice list. There's also PyMonad https://bitbucket.org/jason_delaat/pymonad, unmaintained but generally solid implentations of Maybe, Either, Reader, etc.
I think this is a small optimization to reduce additional calls on each call to `add`. It would remove a sliver of processing time from each call to `seen.add`, since the dot operator calls `seen.__getattr__`, which looks up the attribute `add` in `seen.__dict__`. There may be other overhead or checks along the way too.
It's a technique for optimizing away the function lookup calls. This is described more [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSpeed/PerformanceTips).
For sure, I'm super into machine learning and recommender systems, my research is on social network and mapping the organizational structure of user inputted data, so I'm really interested in how non-tech communities produce data. You may not know this, but [Ravelry](http://www.ravelry.com/) is THE site for knitters. (I also knit), and as fate and luck would have it, they have an [API](http://www.programmableweb.com/api/ravelry) I don't know how much you know about recommenders, but this specifically is an awesome data set because they use both tags and star ratings which means you can build really awesome models of interest on a user to user, as well as a system wide basis. The rest is just toying with different statistical models, figuring out what works and hooking single user preferences in to try to predict what they're interested in. You will have to do some training, but for me that's part of the fun. Mining the Social Web is a great resource for learning more about these sorts of projects. Hope that helps!
I just looked at the [implementation of `compose`](https://github.com/pytoolz/toolz/blob/master/toolz/functoolz.py#L507). To me it actually seems kind of inelegant -- e.g., why the special cases for 0 or 1 functions? And why have a special variable self.first in the `Compose` object for the first function? Here's a simple implementation with no special cases: def compose(*funcs): def f(x): for func in reversed(funcs): x = func(x) return x return f edit: I guess there is a reason to have a special `first` function -- it accepts `*args` and `**kwargs` rather than just a single argument like the rest of the functions. Personally I don't think I'd particularly want to use `compose` in that way, but I suppose it makes sense to offer it.
Thanks for the prompt but where do I begin 
You are too kind. I know my limits. Like many developers, I know too many flavor du jour languages, and have paid the price for not getting deep into one tech stack. Python I hope is my last major language. Regret lisp. 
Use something like IFTTT or Tasker to do it natively on Android.
I'm definitely following your example of being an ass. My post was something that automatically does this for *all* virtualenvs on a system. You proposed a manual work around that only works for a single ve. While creating a requirements.txt could be added to a build script, again, it has to be done on a per ve basis and kind of misses the point. 
[removed]
You shouldn't install libraries on a whim for random scripts, you should deliberately decide which libraries and even what versions are required. You're behaving like your environments change wildly, when they really ought not to, and if they do, forcing you to manually update a requirements.txt file should make you think "is this really what I want"? No one has the problem you're having, for good reason -- it's not a real problem. I guess I don't generally enjoy watching hobbyists flail around, and further enjoy it less when a hobbyist comes into my professional domain and tries to tell me they've discovered something new or useful. You haven't.
I shall check that out sir. Thanks
I'm a bit confused, Go is not functional, neither is python. Learning a functional language can make you a better programmer but to get that benefit you should use one of the actual functional languages, when you have to program in that way. Those custom libraries are useful if you want to use some approaches from functional languages, but they won't teach you to program that way.
I mean, it's been said, but just to add, don't do this.
If you enjoy it, then Flask is the way to go for sure. Most of the times I just wanna make the idea happen and meet hot deadlines. In a time like that I may not be able to build everything by myself. To be honest, when I have the time I re-invent some of the third-parties in the code base just learn and enjoy, but only if I know what I'm doing and know the outcome.
Why?
Python 2.7 is still alive! Yeeeeeeeeehhhhhh!!!!!!
I should have done c back then. Would be an embedded dev making good money and stable job. 
Either using Markov Chains (simple) or a Recurrent Neural Network (harder), you can try making a simple text generator. The hard part would be finding a dataset to train it against since I doubt you have access to a lot of text that she's said outside of maybe your own conversation with her. Alternatively, you can train it on your own text and present it as a bot of yourself. If you're going the Markov Chain route, it's pretty straightforward and there are some decent tutorials out there. If you're going the RNN method, I would volunteer to work on it with you (replacing the MC implementation in my current bot) but I'm going on vacation tomorrow and won't be back until almost Christmas. Good luck! If you want help with a simple MC implementation I can link the relevant file on my project's GitHub. 
Ah, OK. Yeah, C seems more in demand than Lisp nowadays.
Embedded c is not talked about much, but the guys who have the work are commanding $1500hr
Very impressive!
Poor guy getting downvoted!
&gt;without *losing
How does one get development privileges on iftt? I submitted a request and never heard back so I'm limited to the weak sauce recipes.
Second in this. There's no need to specifically use Python for this. Python is a great hammer, but not everything is a nail. 
Put the repo up on Github and let them clone it. If they were expecting to use a web app they can clone a repo and pip install requirements. 
Oh, sure! It's not done yet, but it's coming along nicely. Actually, have a look for yourself: [here's a screenshot of how how it looks right now](http://i.imgur.com/c40mFiJ.png). What's left right now is the HDMI CEC part (that is, actually interfacing with your TV), and a few stability improvements. Oh, and some time math, but that stuff's boring. Glad you're interested!
I wouldn't use globals. Just define them in a module and import them.
&gt; orthogonal What do you mean by this? I just started writing a simple text adventure in order to learn about OOP. Are you saying that this is a fools errand? 
Indeed, great explanation and show case. I hate it when people would lay down the whole thing into X web framework. It should be mainly in that way and the main application should be doing fine through an API. Some of the Flask extensions do that fairly well, such as Flask-Auth where you can get it working with other exts as well. The thing is, when we want to have things ready made and integrated well. Such as Admin app, etc... These are the reason we get stuck with framework that provide them out of the box, before we know it, we're writing and aiming for the framework and all of sudden the application will not work without that framework. I love "Unless you want to choose a non-RDBMS as your backend, then you're stuck hacking that into Django. :P" another great way to putting it. Plus, sqlalchemy is lovely &lt;3
For real?
If you get incident tickets, rather than diving straight into the data talking to someone who is having an issue.
Doesn't matter if the end user is not technical. Pick a handful and give them a call back. The best way to understand a problem is to speak with a real user.
My suggestion would be to use sklearn to remove stop words from the freeform field and then see what words show up as the most common in the free form area. Then use that as a springboard to group and classify data. I am sure after you see the same words coming from the tickets time and time again you can modify your script to classify the issues fairly easily.
I think I went with Python initially because I knew how to implement the pieces for the maps API and texting the message. Plus it's a learning experience for me, so I was trying to make it work. I was trying to figure out if there was some thing obvious that I was missing to do something like this. 
I made a tool for biologists that have little to no computational skills. I'm definitely going to put the code up on github for people who know how to use the command line programs. How does it work to host something online that requires modules? 
Welcome to reddit, where systematically rejecting things you don't want to see is the norm.
Literally anyone sitting on hundreds of thousands of lines of legacy code built on dependencies that got left behind in jump to 3. Aka, my entire research team.
Except that for very large institutions it's hard to get anyone to sign off on an upgrade to 3 and they continue to extend the timeline for deprecating 2. If you work in film or video games, no 3D package supports 3. There was no compelling reason for them to upgrade. So every Autodesk product that supports Python is still on 2 with no plans to upgrade. I'd love to move to 3, but until Autodesk gives me that ability, I'm stuck on 2. I'll keep waiting for them to upgrade to the latest outdated version of 2 and complain until they change. If you're a startup or can move to 3, do it. But there's a swath of people out there that are bound to 2 due to software requirements or organizational indifference. The idea that there should be a holy war on 2 vs 3 is simplistic at best and idiotic at worst.
Not exactly related because there's no support for NFC, but you might like [Termux](http://termux.com/) and [Termux-API](https://github.com/termux/termux-api).
IMO a lot of it has to do with the fact that almost every shop still uses 2.7 You're better off learning what you'll actually use
Thank you for the throughout explanation. It seems that I don't know half as much as I need to about this. Going to have to investigate 
Is 2.7 so much different from 3.0 when it comes to writing the Python language? Much of the changes are in the standard library, and all of those are additive, and many have been backported unofficially to 2.7
AKA most of the production python code
Thanx for advice, I gonna do it now

How does this compare with the recent rise of the pendulum project, I was hoping Pendulum to be the only datetime library I would need to use in the future as we have too many datetime libraries already in Python.
I would say that Kenneth could better spend his talent at creating something different besides the 100th date lib. Now, finding dates in text, and converting them, that'd be a great venture! I made a start with metadate, but it's quite tough, I'd love to see others take on the challenge. pip install metadate and then: &gt;&gt;&gt; from metadate import parse_date &gt;&gt;&gt; parse_date("tomorrow") MetaPeriod(2016-12-19 00:00:00, 2016-12-20 00:00:00, day,['tomorrow'], en) &gt;&gt;&gt; parse_date("next week Tuesday at 2pm") MetaPeriod(2017-01-03 14:00:00, 2017-01-03 15:00:00, hour, ['next', 'week', 'Tuesday', '2pm'], en) happy new year! &gt;&gt;&gt; parse_date("sunday in 2 weeks at 0:00") MetaPeriod(2017-01-01 00:00:00, 2017-01-01 00:01:00, minute, ['sunday', '2', 'weeks', '0:00'], en) Travel bot can do: &gt;&gt;&gt; from natura import Finder &gt;&gt;&gt; money_finder = Finder() &gt;&gt;&gt; input_string = "I want to go for a holiday for $200 in spring" &gt;&gt;&gt; parse_date(input_string) MetaPeriod(2017-03-21 00:00:00, 2017-06-21 00:00:00, season, ['spring'], en) &gt;&gt;&gt; money_finder.find(input_string) Money(value=200.0, currency=USD, spans=[(31, 32), (32, 35)], matches=['$', '200'], base=EUR, base_amount=191.58923268512308, last_modified_base=2016-12-18 09:59:06.060406) Maybe I'll give it another go in the christmas holidays, but the problem is that "recurrent dates" and "duration" are a nasty thing on top of this. Is there anyone else who would like to be involved (unfortunately this is not really a beginner's challenge)? What about you, Kenneth :)?
I really liked the Functional HOWTO from the manual: https://docs.python.org/2.7/howto/functional.html But what I don't understand is: why the big focus on iterators?
There are libraries like [pywinauto](https://pywinauto.github.io/) that let you start applications and simulate mouse and keyboard events. That would work unless you need some deeper level of integration with the emulator itself.
Yup. My neighbor does it, he codes for industrial controllers 
Well, Oracle and IBM are stuck on python 2.2 or 2.5. I'm not going to say "hey, newbs should learn 2.2!" - newbs should learn 3.5 and bitch with vendors shipping outdated crap. Progress is made by people who won't settle for less.
I think the message you're trying to convey can be clearer :) What I get from the examples is that you'll always try to convert to UTC? Btw, I also personally like from metadate that there is something like a start and end date to a period. &gt;&gt;&gt; tomorrow = maya.when('tomorrow') &lt;MayaDT epoch=1481919067.23&gt; I wouldn't really represent "tomorrow" with an epoch time ;) Rather, tomorrow starts at midnight and ends at the next midnight...
I am now working on metadate v2 to parse sentences like: every 2 weeks between this year and the next until March on Tuesdays and Wednesdays \ at ten and 11 pm for 10 minutes You will get a period object on which you can iterate and get like: MetaPeriod(2016-12-14 22:00:00, 2016-12-14 22:10:00, ...) # Wed MetaPeriod(2016-12-14 23:00:00, 2016-12-14 23:10:00, ...) # Wed MetaPeriod(2016-12-27 22:00:00, 2016-12-27 22:10:00, ...) # Tue MetaPeriod(2016-12-27 23:00:00, 2016-12-27 23:10:00, ...) # Tue MetaPeriod(2016-12-28 22:00:00, 2016-12-28 22:10:00, ...) # Wed MetaPeriod(2016-12-28 23:00:00, 2016-12-28 23:10:00, ...) # Wed ... MetaPeriod(2017-02-24 23:00:00, 2017-02-24 23:10:00, ...) # Wed I guess it will be a long time before this actually works well though. 
Because element-wise multiplication is still useful, and it's good to be explicit when you're not doing that. Also I like the idea of using the `__matmul__` methods and it makes sense to require a different symbol to access them. As for the symbol itself, I think @ is ok - what would you have chosen?
Oh yeah. Only this Friday did I end up fighting with Python2's joyful corruption of Unicode data. Input is pure, well formatted Json. This is _by definition_ unicode data, and JSON is only allowed to be UTF-8/16/32, and defaults to UTF-8. Then Python2 comes in, takes this JSON, decodes it into objects, and then promptly throws away this vital part. Instead, leaving us with a set of bytes that pretend to be ascii, which contain unprintable characters. Which Python2, in it's maniglorious maliciousness, decides cannot be cast back to unicode. Because fuck your language, fuck your characters, and fuck your existence. And fuck Python2.
Is [this](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html) what you're looking for?
Numpy contains two kinds of matrices: numpy.matrix and numpy.ndarray. The first kind is always 2D, and multiplication performs matrix multiplication. This can be very handy for matrix-heavy math code. The second kind can have an arbitrary number of dimensions, and all operations are performed element-wise. To perform a matrix multiplication with ndarrays, you can use X.dot(Y), or numpy.dot(X, Y), or X @ Y.
If a huge company like Autodesk, is still on 2.7 (And many other companies as well), then 2.7 is faaaaar from done. There might be packages that are totally unrelated to 3d modeling, but since big companies are still using 2.7, then everything around them needs to "stay behind" so they can have interoperability.
Not sure why you get downvoted for a valid question.
matrix type is frowned upon by even numpy dev team. It turned out to be a nuisance rather than convenience. Regular `*` for arrays are element-wise and you have to write `.dot()` for every array multiplication. Hence `@` is introduced. The PEP goes through all kinds of other candidates and `@` seemed the only viable option
Ah I see, thanks for clarifying. I've never used objects or classes before (just finished my first semester of a CS degree, and they only introduced the notion on the last day) so I thought it would be a good way to get to grips with them. 
I do prefer Pendulum's immutable and chaining behaviour. It's a lot more clear and human-like. But perhaps I'm biased because I use it and have a fork running.
I doubt many serious python programmers get to avoid either 2.x or 3.x entirely.
Even if we adopt the idea that @ means "matrix multiply" which is not at all obvious to a casual observer, the idea that we'd use it as an override to literally whatever we want is gross misuse of a symbol.

Sikuli can match specific images. Is that not what you want?
``s`` usually stands for string.
