&gt; Python 2.7.9 is the best Python interpreter version to use with notmm. Uhmmm I think I'll pass. Also, after a few minutes of searching into the documentation, I wasn't able to find a single quick example to see some basic usage of this library.
Have you tried a MOOC yet? Ive tried out a couple and found them to be very helpful, and they both had exercises with solutions
Sorry, the docs are work-in-progress and quite outdated. You can check the examples however online from here: https://bitbucket.org/tkadm30/django-hotsauce/src/3a9fb554556a59df3f332f174eadfb975607b05d/examples/?at=0.7-stable
If you use Nuitka, you get a binary that provides a lot more clues for reverse engineering than a normal release build of a native C++ executable or library does. Even after compilation and linking, Nuitka's output preserves all of your Python code's variable names, function and method names, argument names, and various other helpful names, and uses them when managing data and making its straightforward calls into the python interpreter libraries. For more info, you can see http://bitboost.com/python-obfuscator/articles_and_resources/does_nuitka_remove_names_of_variables_functions_classes_etc/ . To also remove most of those names I mentioned above, you can use a Python code obfuscator such as http://bitboost.com/python-obfuscator, and then run Nuitka on the obfuscator's output. (Obligatory disclaimer: I've used C++ and Python to write commercially released software products, into some of which I've built various degrees of resistance to reverse engineering--so some ideologues are certain that I am EVIL AND BAD AND WRONG. Also, I am the author of the obfuscator linked above.)

Someone should mention that Python code obfuscators are available, such as http://bitboost.com/ . A good obfuscator can usually be used in combination with other software build tools. Some obfuscators, such as the BitBoost one, have features for releasing software with different subsets of functionality, incorporating user license keys and user information at build time, etc. (Obligatory disclaimer: I've used Python and C++ to write commercially released software products, into some of which I've built various degrees of resistance to reverse engineering--so some ideologues are certain that I am EVIL AND BAD AND WRONG.

I'd look into Spyder. If you got rstudio through anaconda, you can download it via the anaconda navigator. Otherwise, here's the [repo](https://github.com/spyder-ide).
Thanks, the main program will be running continuously anyway since it is an embedded system written on Raspberry Pi. Just thought this might be a generic python question.
&gt; Ask not what Python can do for you...ASK WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR PYTHON. Bloody cheek, nicking my Python email signature :-)
Yeah, I did on my phone. It brought me to an overview of codewars. &gt; The codewars itself uses the code i write, i dont know how exactly. You're not running from an IDE like IDLE/PyCharm/Wing or the command line? That's what people do.
I've gotten so good at this, that I can smell Indian just by looking at the title on reddit.
So, there are many reasons why this class will not pass the assignment. I will teach you why it isn't passing the sample test; you should use my advice so that you can make it pass the assignment too. The test tries to add together two `Vector` instances using the `add()` method and then tries to call the `equals()` on the resulting `Vector` instance. This isn't working because your implementation of `add()` returns a list instead of a `Vector` instance. The test tries to call `equals()` on the list and fails miserably. Modify your class as follows: Your solution: def add(self, vec): if self.len == vec.len: return [x+y for x,y in zip(self.vec, vec.vec)] My solution def add(self, vec): if self.len == vec.len: return Vector([x+y for x,y in zip(self.vec, vec.vec)]) Notice how we are returning a `Vector` instance instead of a list? However, the test will still fail. Currently, `equals()` is checking to see if one `Vector` instance is equal to another. But this will always return False. Because the two `Vector` instances have different allocations in memory, the comparison will always return False. You need to compare the underlying list object. Modify your class as follows: Your solution: def equals(self, vec): if self == vec: return True return False My solution def equals(self, vec): if self.vec == vec.vec: return True return False Now we are not comparing the `Vector` instances directly, but the underlying list objects. If you click Run Sample Tests, the test will pass. However, clicking Attempt will fail. I hope I have given you enough info to be able to extend your class to pass the Attempt. If you need extra info, do feel free to message me again :)

This is not how Codewars work. Here, you provide a class and Codewars attempts to "use" the class. You pass if Codewars gets the answers it expects back.

Even if you stay with the check every second approach, you should set this up such that you've got a time checking portion that knows about the time at which to fire different even t's and does so appropriately. Also don't expect exact second granularity to be completely accurate so you'll need to check if the next target time is now or in the past.
Thank you for the appreciation!!!

Excellent - pm if you need help
Awesome work! I like what you did! Maybe you can provide a write-up for this? How did you count the cliches? Are there any interesting relationships between some advice? Are there any limitations in your methods? 
Uh, no smart-ass, but you can easily queue up a bunch of tasks and using a randomly selected delay is trivial. If UI makes or breaks it for you, you might be better off just using javascript for everything. Not even being facetious- I've been playing with Vuejs recent and I quite like it. But anyways, for example, there is [redash](https://github.com/getredash/redash) which is based on celery and has an angular front-end. Yeah, you have to kinda know what you're doing a little bit to use celery, but I mean let's look at whats been suggested: * asyncio: not scalable, unless you want to re-invent the wheel. Also complicated if you want to go beyond the simple examples they provide. Also requires a good foundation on threading, concurrent design. * twisted: much more complicated than celery. these days benchmarks are looking not so favorable for twisted. * gevent/eventlet/tornado - pretty much all in the same class (servers) not as focused on queues (although they can, of course). I've used celery for handling some pretty massive tasks and it works fine. So dunno what your hang-up is. 
Even I was pretty impressed by the number of times this thing posted. I'd like to thank the Reddit app for making this possible.

If you'd do some statistics gathering and data visualization, that'd be sweet!
it's better if you start showing your findings
You can search through all available modules on [PyPI](https://pypi.io). Try `praw` for Reddit scraping. Once you've found a module you want to use, install it with `pip install praw` or similar. It's better to run that command in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) so you don't pollute your system.
thanks for the info and the advice!
Hey, same here! What kind of implementations are you trying out? I'm working on an algorithm for dynamic pricing with my university currently. 
To the people downvoting GitHubPermalinkBot: What if in 6 months, a year or two years the projects that are being linked (in general, not specifically in this case) have grown bloated or have been restructured heavily? Then the permalinks will still be good whereas links to master will not make much sense or might even link to renamed files so they'll just 404. This bot is nice, don't downvote it :(

Not a bad first program at all. Congrats on your first post. As your programs get bigger and more complicated, it will become more important to maintain separate "chunks" of code that don't interact in unexpected ways. So, it's much better to "return" the results from a function rather than use global variables. For example: def build_dict(file_name): """ ISOLATE AND FORMAT EACH WORD TO ALLOW OPERATIONS """ dict_list = list() dictionary = open(file_name, 'r') for line in dictionary: word = line.strip() # REMOVE WHITESPACE dict_list.append(word) dictionary.close() return dict_list That keeps most of the flavor of the original code, but avoids the need for dict_list to be a global variable. It also isolates all of the file I/O in one function, which is often a good principle to follow. There is If there actually is no "whitespace" in the file, and we just need to strip the line-breaks, that whole function could probably be converted to a single line of more "Pythonic" code, like this: dict_list = open('dictionary.txt').read().splitlines() You also have a pretty elegant palindrome-checking method at the heart of your program, but the function you called 'is_palindrome()' has a lot of other stuff mixed in with it. I would separate out all of the other junk from the core function, and make it two functions like this: def is_palindrome(word): """ check if a word is a palindrome (spelled the same both forwards and backwards) return True or False """ if word == word[-1::-1]: return True # the word is a palindrome else return False # the word is not a palindrome def get_palindrome_list(word_list): """ combine every word in a word list with another word in the dictionary and check if the combination of the two words added together is a palindrome return a list of all of the palindromes found """ palindrome_list = dict() first = 'a' # COMPLETELY OPTIONAL, FOR FEEDBACK ON PROGRESS for word in word_list: if word[0] != first: # FEEDBACK ON PROGRESS; COMPLETELY OPTIONAL first = word[0] print("Now in the {0}'s".format(first)) runningtime = time.time() - timestart print('Running time: {0} seconds'.format(runningtime)) for word2 in word_list: # IF EVALUATES AS TRUE OUTPUTS RESULTS TO A TXT FILE combined_word = word + word2 if is_palindrome(combined_word): palindrome_list.append(word1 + ' ' + word2) return palindrome_list This also makes is possible to write "tests", that you can use to check if your code works the way you think it does. Writing code in a way that makes is testable will become much more important as your programs get more complicated, but it's a good habit to get into early. Last comment, since you are just learning Python, you're probably better off starting with version 3.

I'm trying to create a predictive model using the past training data and validating it on test data. So right now I'm just trying out different hyperparameters such as number of nodes and number of layers. Right now I've been trying out a two layer LSTM and varying the amount of hidden nodes in each layer. TensorFlow comes with an LSTM implementation so that was nice and easy to do. How about yourself?

The counting method seems flawed. When, for example, you take any mention of the word "lawyer" to mean that someone is suggesting you get a lawyer, you aren't accounting for instances where someone says "her father is a lawyer" or "I consulted a lawyer about a similar situation years ago and they said to do this thing" in which "lawyer" is mentioned but no one is suggesting that anyone gets a lawyer.
What I thought so, and what I mean by "I don't think that it will resist a long time to reverse engineering". It will be enough if someone see the folder and say "Oh crap, it's binary!", but no more..

why? concurrent futures with multiprocessing &amp; map is simple with just two lines of code, comes included by python3, and scales linearly for big jobs.
FWIW, IPython still exists. It is the shell component. IPython *notebooks* are what are not Jupyter. At least that is how I understand it: &gt; IPython itself is focused on interactive Python, part of which is providing a Python kernel for Jupyter.
Working with the Asana API to create an app for automating project and task creation at work. We're considering using Asana as a replacement for software we are currently using, and this automation is a necessary part of that switch.
Programming languages are tools used to accomplish a job. Once you learn a lot of the concepts of programming(loops, functions, objects, etc..), you use programming to accomplish a job, such as analyzing data, processing transactions, serving a blog to users, etc.. Learn how to apply your programming skills to solve real problems that businesses have, and you'll be able to get a job just about anywhere. Also, many programming languages are capable of helping you solve most problems, but have grown(or were initially designed) to be particularly good at solving a particular set of problems. I typically recommend that developers learn one systems programming language(e.g. C) for performance critical things, one higher level, general purpose lanaguage(e.g. Java or Python), and Javascript because if you're working in the field of user applications, there's a good chance that sooner or later you'll have to do some kind of website development. On an anecdotal note, I mostly work in the user application space(working writing applications for businesses) and I use Java and Python primarily in my job. Java is extremely common and in high demand from tech departments of businesses, and Python is also commonly used because more often than not, developer velocity(how quickly a developer can take an idea from the drawing board to production) is a more costly expense than the difference in execution speed of the programs. Luckily, the concepts in both Java and Python are pretty complimentary, so learning one or the other will allow you to pick up the other pretty easily.

Haha sweet dude!! I just had an idea for a Reddit bot today so I am gonna use this. 
If the link to a specific file is broken, I just go to the project page. Fixing the link manually does not take any relevant amount of effort, time or expertise. It would probably even take longer to go back to the comments and find the correct link. 
I write testing automation using pytest. My company has a slack app written in JS so I took its docker container, setup my flask server to mock slack side, put that inside a docker container and started then using a custom docker network. Slack client is configured to content my flask server instead if real slack, so I send a POST to the slack client and then retrieve the response from my flask mock server. It's pretty cool, and I could easily reuse that infrastructure regardless of the Bot framework or provider.
I expected the same. I'm pretty disappointed, and surprised at how many upvotes this got, considering this could have been done by a beginner
Most people who do python are self-taught. Almost everyone at my company is.
Aww ok, good to know! 
you're missing something something narcissist 
I've taken classes in several scripting/programming languages but they all are basically the same. Learn the basic syntax then look at the documentation for guidance. In a class environment you really can't go into depth enough to learn everything about one language let alone more than one. I would even argue that all programming is self taught and furthermore it is a continuous effort.
Hahaha' That was fun, thanks for sharing the code, it's great for study!
It's also just two lines of code with joblib, and joblib has much more flexible support for different cluster architectures. I can run the same code on my laptop, one node of my cluster, or in an HPC context with virtually no changes to the overall program.
In the world of pure Python - that is, all of your tasks are Python code and are running in the same kernel, you probably want to use [dask](http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/). If some of these calculations are separate scripts or routines, other tools may be a slightly better fit. I'm a huge fan of [snakemake](http://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), although other tools like [luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi) also work for this purpose.
It's been a year or two since I've used it. IIRC my main complaints about celery were with how hard it was to implement anything like task priorities, and it being easy to lose tasks on error. It was probably a configuration/implementation problem but the documentation was pretty bad.
Depends on what you mean by that. I 'self taught' myself python but I have a CS degree and know several other languages, as I suspect many others do.
Some of the best PLC programmers I know are all self taught- they are also the best troubleshooters that I have had the pleasure of working with. Coincidentally that is why I decided to get into python- to learn something non job related and to keep my mind fresh for troubleshooting as well as automate some of the mondain tasks.
1) what are your use cases for this where something like Flask is "too much"? 2) OWASP is a good start for researching software security.

THIS was the best answer you could give! :) Thank you man. I finally understood what i was doing wrong Here's my new code import math class Vector: def __init__(self, vec): self.vec = vec self.len = len(vec) def add(self, vec): if self.len == vec.len: return Vector([x+y for x,y in zip(self.vec, vec.vec)]) def subtract(self, vec): if self.len == vec.len: return Vector([x-y for x,y in zip(self.vec, vec.vec)]) def dot(self, vec): if self.len == vec.len: return sum([x*y for x,y in zip(self.vec, vec.vec)]) def norm(self): vecsquared = [x**2 for x in self.vec] return math.sqrt(sum(vecsquared)) def toString(self): return '(%s)' % ','.join(str(x) for x in self.vec) def equals(self, vec): if self.vec == vec.vec: return True return False It stills doesn't pass the test of the string function, even though i build it on sublime and it works fine :| Idk maybe codewars is brokn
Make it machine learning so it analysises what is common said and adds it to the list ;)
Codewars is very misleading here. Change `def toString` to `def __str__`. This will make the attempt pass. `__str__` is the string representation of the object, and is shown if you try to print the object out.
My dad introduced me to C++, taught me some of the computing fundamentals; what's a pointer, iterator, objects. I made some pretty basic programs for him. I think those first few conceptual steps are the hardest point when learning, and I was lucky to have someone help me with that. When I Ieft home he recommended Python to me, I found it removed a lot of the unnecessary junk from C++ that irritated me, and that I could quickly make stuff that was useful to me. From then I was hooked and kept learning mostly through a desire to write 'better' (or more beautiful! ) code. 
Not bad but you're missing two cliches from the reddit trifecta of advice. 1) Lawyer up, 2) Hit the gym 3) grow a beard
The same package can be available in both the Ubuntu repos and in the PyPI repo. The packages from the Ubuntu repo get installed into the system Python directories. With packages from PyPI it depends on how you install them. Packages from the Ubuntu repos are installed with commands like this: sudo apt-get python-beautifulsoup You can search the available ones by using a command like this: apt-cache search beautiful An advantage of the Ubuntu repos, if the package you want is there, is that it is simple to install and it works for all the users of the OS. The disadvantage is that the packages are not updated often and so they can be be out of date. For BeautifulSoup4 you probably need to install from PyPI with pip. If you are doing development then you should create a virtualenv and install into it from PyPI. Activate the virtualenv and run: pip install beautifulsoup4 Without using a virtualenv you can still install a package locally, for your user only, by using the `--user` option: pip install --user beautifulsoup4 It is generally not recommended to install into the system Python from PyPI. If you really need to do it the command would be: sudo pip install beautifulsoup4 # not recommended 
Thx
If you want to knock up something that you can read and modify in 6 months time use Python, else use perl.
I was self taught in Matlab and then I moved to Python and self taught myself for the same kind of tasks. Then I began to use Python to do everything! I read lots of forums such as these, read newsletters, read documentation, and experiment. I choose projects to work on on my own time and some, more relevant ones, to do during work. I often look over my old code and think about how I could improve it today. And sometimes, I dive in and do it!
What does this have to do with python? The *only* mention of python in the whole article is a link unrelated to the article?
I for example needed something simple for an api backend for a desktop app. In this case flask was more than I needed. I know about OWASP, but that is not what I want. I was asking about security considerations at the wsgi level which a framework should implement as opposed to security issues at the application level in which case the security is the concern of the app developer and owasp would actually come in handy.
You might build python yourself from the source code and install it in a custom location. This way you can use the newest version and don't interfere with your system python. So you can use PyPi and don't need to be super user to install packages.
twisted isn't a web library though it can be used in that domain. it's much more versatile than that.
i guess I'm out of the loop. has twist ed been supplanted and put to bed now?
Sure. But it's a networking tool. Not a numerical analysis tool.
`str` as a variable name? Also, what makes this "news about the dynamic, interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, extensible programming language Python"?

I think you better lawyer up and break up! 
everyone who's good at anything is self taught. it's not something to worry or brag about.
Playing devils advocate, what does Flask have that it requires you to use that is too much to the point of justifying rolling your own WSGI framework? A simple API for a desktop app is pretty much what something like Flask excels at. You can use it to power pages using templates or serve static files or just use it to build a simple JSON Rest API for a CRUD app. I'm asking not to be a dick or discourage you, but rather to help clarify whether or not your application really has a need for a new WSGI framework (which will cost you considerably in time and effort) or whether you can use something like Flask or Pyramid and elect to just not use certain features? If it's for educational purposes I encourage you to read up on the WSGI documentation and build it out, but from the sounds of your post it sounds like you intend to use it for a public facing application where the time and effort spent on rolling your own framework probably won't be worth the cost from a business perspective.
Yes, well, if everything were perfect out of the gate, we wouldn't be on this version number ;)

oh thanks! so the ubuntu repos also have some packages! I had to install the pip manually even though it's supposed to come within the normal install of python, I don't know why, so I used sudo apt install python-pip It seems to work fine, and now I'm learning about the virtual environments, there is virtualenv and venv I don't know their differences yet but I'm steal reading. thank you.
Ok another method, thanks. 
I love it when it replies to sarcastic smilies.
dude, I had the same idea I just hadn't had the time to figure out implementation. Thank you for this. I also didn't know if it would actually speed up my results, because I thought that it would still be taking the time to compare every other word, due to the fact I didn't know how to get it to completely disregard all the entries that didn't at least end with the correct letter. Thanks!
Thanks alot for your reply, you are absolutely correct about returning the dict_list. Amateur mistake I guess, lol. Also, I have recently begun stopping with Python 2 and am focusing only on 3 from now on, ever since I found out that any support for 2.x will be stopped in 2020. I had also noticed myself that I had no easy way of checking what was actually happening when, which on an earlier version would have helped. I thought I had it working but I had noticed it skipped a palindrome I had found manually and after fixing it, found out it was completely broken and missing about 80% of the possible matches. I'll be sure to keep your advice in mind for future projects, thanks again.
Self taught Python, SQL, VB.NET, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Excel, etc etc etc. I studied Econometrics and Mathematics. After college, you have to be a continuous learning. Life is a journey. If Python helps you in life, then that's great and keep learning and contributing! :)
You're not a dick at all. I fully understand. I know that using Flask or something similar is the best approach, and that is what I will most likely end up doing for the end, production-ready app. But this was more of just an exercise for me in my spare time. That's all. :)
I don't even know if it's possible to learn anything without being self taught. Even if someone shows you the basics you still have to apply that knowledge in various new situations. To teach yourself is part of the process of acquire knowledge.
I got the txt file from http://thinkpython2.com/code/words.txt. I had gotten a copy of Think Python from a friend and this particular project was just due to a dumb idea I had and wanting to try and flex what bit of coding muscle I've acquired. Yes, I am fully aware of what an actual palindrome is, lol, thank you though. And I didn't even think to make this program a bit more universally useful, I was only coding it with the words.txt file I had on hand in mind. It wouldnt take much do do a .lower() and sorted() operation on whatever file was being used. Thanks for recommending the timeit module, I know I had read about it, but I hadn't checked it out yet, but most importantly thanks for the advice on opening the file, that was the core reason for even writing this script was trying my hand at file handling. Thanks for taking the time to critique my work and point out what I could do better!
It's a fun exercise. I done the same a year ago while I was learning about web development. About your questions, wsgi is just a pattern to parser the request. The security problems comes when you must decide what you are going to do with this request. If you want to take a look: https://github.com/Marcelo-Theodoro/MyOwnPythonWebFramework
Working with multithreads is very important and crucial for some programs. But you should know, concurrency can lead to high complexity in the code which lead to high vulnerability. Errors might occur and you need to know how detect and fix them. There are tools who doing that, such as checkamrx and others but it is recommended to do it also on your own.
Sure! Try [transfer.sh](https://transfer.sh); this way others can download it too.
Is there a specific thing I should look up to learn about this? Referring to building checks into my code
That's right on it! Thank you!
This is awesome, but for us outside of the US, What is JADE?
Twisted still isn't fully 3.x functional (though keeps getting closer). From personal use it just feels like it became this large thing that tries to do everything (from web to SSH to IMAP to DNS, etc...) and have to write your code to fit it's architecture, whereas there are a lot of other libraries to do specific things just as good if not better without any baggage. So, depending on which role you are trying to fill you might look at gevent / gunicorn for WSGI, tornado for more custom async networking, or even the new builtin asyncio. 
The best library is the one that you need right here, right now, to achieve whatever your aim is, everything else at this point is pretty much irrelevant.
Any example images?
im not sure if i used the website correctly, but i believe that you should be able to download it here: https://transfer.sh/shjsc/image.png
Everything in your while loop runs after each game; So, after you increment `pcount` or `ccount`, your loop repeats - and look what happens when it repeats: you set `pcount` and `ccount` to zero. With variables like that, you want to init them outside of the scope of the loop. And as a side note, `moves` and `player_win`, as they do not change, should probably also be initialised outside of the loop.
Really cool! I really enjoy making similar things using Python. Thanks for sharing!
I guess I would say I taught myself python, but had formal education on computer science and engineering principles.
The Python 3 version of pip is in the package `python3-pip`. You run it with `pip3`. Virtualenvs have their own versions of pip.
To be fair flask is only minimal when it comes to its API surface, and just barely then. It's built on top of the quite rigorous Werkzeug library that does most of the WSGI heavy lifting.
I don't know that much about the subject but some things mind are: * Do not leak exception details to the end user in production mode (they are relevant to display in development) * When serving static files, ensure they are properly locked to a particular directory. You wouldn't want to leak `/etc/passwd` when somebody does something silly. * Never trust anything the request tells you about the user/requesting browser. Most things can be spoofed
I have a master's in computer science, but I consider myself self-taught in a lot of areas. I learned to program in high school, and at that point I was completely self taught. College taught me a lot of general concepts, and some specifics in Java, but I learned python, javascript, and a lot of other languages on my own. Certainly, the concepts I learned in college helped with being able to pick up the concepts from language to language, but the only language I was actually taught in college was Java, and I almost never use it professionally.

Here's the thing; most programming languages have gained suggestions just like this one. Yet, you don't see anyone writing Ruby or C++ using localised syntax. There's a good reason for this. Let's say that you'd want to write a transpiler that would convert your "translated" Python code back to Python and execute it by calling the Python installation. The statements can be translated easily enough, because there's a limited amount of them, but what about function names - both built-in and 3rd-party library ones - which would still need to comply to your guidelines? And how are you going to deal with the language structure, considering English and [your-chosen-language] likely have a different word order or such anyway? While this is technically "possible", the amount of work required and headaches caused by it just aren't worth the effort. Feel free to make your own language that isn't based on English, though! Should be an interesting training experience.
That explains why it installed on the python 2 folder. Thank you.
[Zhpy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zhpy/) lets you use Chinese keywords with Python (but as I don't speak Chinese I don't know how useful it is). 
If you are interested... There's a pseudo language called Portugol or "Português Estruturado"(structured portuguese). At the first it was just Pascal in portuguese, today there's implementations of this "language" for C,C++ and Java too. It's used for some teachers to teach logic and algorithms to kids in Brazil and Portugal. https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugol (PT-BR)
using system crontab sounds as most "efficient approach". There are also pure python libraries, for example [apscheduler](https://apscheduler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 
Me, I started with books. Plenty of good resources in the sidebar.
Justify, Argue, Defend or Explain. http://the-one-you-feed.blogspot.co.uk/2010/09/jade.html
Just got the book for my birthday the other day. About to start it right now
As others have mentioned, self-taught is difficult to define. I suppose that no one is purely self taught - everyone has read help documents, scanned online tutorials or read technical books. Official courses and degrees are great for teaching you to be interested in development, and some basic algorithms, but they are not really great for learning a specific language. Nothing beats building something. And then building something else, which will be better than what you built before, and repeat...
if you could make word-to-word translation, then problem solved - create some python setup where user code is piped through retranslator
Seems like a lot of people on here are self taught. Nothing wrong with that, and nothing wrong with taking classes either. If you're looking for literature to help you learn, Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes, or Automate the Boring Stuff With Python by Al Sweigart would be good resources. If you're interested in taking a more formal class online, I would recommend the MITx Intro to Python class the next time it starts up. It's offered on edX. 
Now you need a bot to find the best, (most popular) advice, and then post it to save relationships. That way everyone knows they need a divorce. 
Self taught. But this is my Nth language or so.
Self taught but had units at uni in C, pascal, fortran, cobol, vb, various scripting languages, so self taught Python came reasonably easy 
[Citation needed]
Checking in. Started with Perl, then PHP, JavaScript, and Ruby (also Lingo back in the day, if anyone knows what that is) before tackling Python. Built a few things in C# (and VB) as well, but I'm not super fluent in that ecosystem. Play with C[++], but most of my things don't require that level of abstraction. I love Python. I still fucking love Perl. Fight me. 
Same here. I have a bachelor in SE, and only after graduating learned Python because I was impressed by it's massive ecosystem of libraries and the ratio of code to results compared to Java and C.
It's a great question. Would be great to find a resource page that relates each section of the OWASP Top 10 to python-WSGI web frameworks. Besides your own code, if you rely WebOb or Werkzeug or similar you should research their vulnerabilities as well, although I would imagine they are quite battle tested.
Well, I'm an engineer. We learn Matlab in school. Most CS people learn Java and/or C++. I've only been coding in Python for 12 years... Python courses are rarely even offered at university level. If you disagree, you need to provide the citation. Go look at the rest of this thread...
As /u/JustOr113 had mentioned, for my remote tasking I use Celery
I certainly do not want to activate the input method and type 5+ keys when "if" is just two strokes.
Your weapon is a pearl and I will use a python. Que the mortal kombat music.
Was taught C++ and php in university. Learned and fell in love with python soon after I graduated in 2011. 
Self-taught at Python, but not necessarily at programming.
At the uni my partner is at, they teach Python as part of the two first year CS papers to introduce people to programming and OO. They then move on and use a variety of other languages through the different courses (Java, c, c++ for the software engineering ones). 
I volunteered to help my colleagues with their manual spreadsheet update problem, by automating their manual work in Python. I've figured out openpyxl quickly enough but I realised I need to do a lot of data interpretations, and Pandas seems like the best fit to handle that. I'm new to Pandas so I'm trying to get myself up to speed or as much as possible with video tutorials. By the way this is also my very first time using Python, but I know programming concepts from Java. I also thought of using C# for my colleagues' problem but after I dabbled with Python, I don't feel like going back to the compiling language's syntax. Python is so much quicker to write.
I Learned Python the Hard Way, before that book was no longer cool enough for school on this sub.
Self taught, and it's my first language (unless you include SQL). I've so far been able to leverage Python/SQL in the form of a few high availability websites using Flask on AWS Elastic Beanstalk/Aurora as well as a web spider that crawls millions of websites a month (also hosted on AWS, but built using Beautiful Soup). Judge me for using 2.7 all you want, but that's my company's fault mainly and not mine. Not bad for a marketing guy.
[You can use numpy.cov](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.cov.html). Just set ddof=0, aweights=p
I don't understand why a half done project is getting up votes. It's an analysis project without running any analysis. 
This is a rule from English language or popular culture, and not a programming idiom. 
I think there are some things to improve as others have mentioned (I hope it doesn't sound like I'm saying I could have done it better myself). I'm really happy that you shared it. I love this kind of stuff. Keep up the good work!
Worth noting you don't really use convnets for language.
Sorta. I am mostly self taught but I took an MITx course on edX. I'm only 13 and I have learned so much. Good luck.
Whatever sounds better
I don't include "py" in the names of my Python packages at all. /edit Admittedly, adding a "py" is a very convenient way to differentiate a package from a related project name (like pymongo, pymssql, etc.).
what the "this"?
I learned javascript first by watching videos and reading articles online. I just learned this to make basic webpages back in the mid to late 2000s. I wanted to learn a language that had more general-purpose use (this was before people wrote *everything* in javascript) and python caught my attention for reasons I don't remember. Same story though, tons of articles, videos, etc. No formal education.
why not mongopy?
There is no idiomatic rule for one over the other (AFAIK).
I did: School -&gt; PHP -&gt; Flash -&gt; Flash/Python -&gt; Python -&gt; Python/React JS sucks, but React + API is better than server side rendered HTML written in django. I do mostly forms for a living.

R/relationships is the funniest fucking subreddit
If you are only talking about Python, then I'm self taught. If you're not counting my prior experience with other languages, then disregard
Yes Str is a string variable.
Structural engineer by education and trade. Learned basic MATLAB in school then taught myself Python after I graduated and figured out MATLAB was like $1000. I know a lot of Python at this point, and a little bit of other languages like Haskell, JavaScript, and Java.
I am completely self taught. I gained competence in Python before any other language (barring HTML + CSS). Automate The Boring Stuff With Python is your friend; it'll teach you enough to build a few things that matter to you.
&gt; Yes Str is a string variable. You seem to have missed the point completely. Shadowing [the built-in `str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-str) is a bad thing to do. In[2]: str(123) Out[2]: '123' In[3]: str = 'dumb variable name' In[4]: str(123) TypeError: 'str' object is not callable If you have any questions, /r/learnpython is very helpful. This subreddit is about news relating to Python. 
Nice and simple script.
What I took issue with is that your post gives the impression that most people who do python are *self-taught programmers.*
I guess it was just the first thing that came to mind. Just wanted to get something up and running relatively quickly. calling sorted() on the dict.keys() was a quick solution. The only downside to how I have it is if there are nodes partially populated with data it won't be able to insert a row. Fortunately the API is consistent enough that this isn't an issue
tfw no programmer dad
Our cs course is 1 semester of python, one of Java, one of C, and one of Assembly 
And now OP must enter the rabbit hole of natural language processing.
My scenario as well.
Sharing my experience here. I used to dislike programming in school (I'm a math major, they taught Matlab and basic C++). In hindsight, it was the teaching methods that hinders me from learning to code. When I start working, I needed to automated many operational tasks. That is where I self-taught Python and the sheer achievement of making something work is great. It is such feeling with the simple syntax that motivates me to learn more advanced aspects of Python. Now I program in Python everyday (my company entire codebase is in Python). Not saying other high-level language are not great, but Python enables someone not from CS to enjoy programming.
Freaky-ass doggo 
variable name updated in program from str to user_string.
cuz the authors thought pymongo sounded better, probably. No real reason.
TIL. This is an interesting move from NSA.
BS in computer engineering , learned java and C++ and self-taught myself python
Please rewrite your code to be compatible with Python 3. It has been out for years and version 2 will drop support relatively SOON! Also, I see that you're using old style formatting. Read up on awesome features of new style formatting. (you might not always need all features, but better to have new style formatting in your head as default)
Hit the lawyer, delete the gym, grow a Facebook. 
In that case the command should better be `{python_executable} -m pip install {module_name}` Typically you don't want your source-built python directory in $PATH, because otherwise its `python`/`python3` and `pip`/`pip3` symlinks collide with the systemwide ones (assuming there is no virtualenv).
Making a drawing module that is simple and can be used by begginers 
I am, more or less. Sometimes it shows. Hopefully most of my code is legible though.
You are correct. Besides all binaries reside in {python_folder}/bin. So you can use {python_folder}/bin/pip instead. You can create different symlinks like mypy, mypip or put aliases into your .bashrc Btw. changing the installation directory is done via /.configure --prefix {your_installation_path} 
Self taught Python for a little over a year now! Reason being C++ in my uni intro courses were too boring and I wanted to actually program productively. Python made me actually enjoy computing--it was the gateway to how I became the programmer that I am today.
I'm the only person who can teach me anything. I'm a great teacher and a horrible student.
Can we downvote this bot though, please?
self-taught + IRC #python
Self-taught in every area. For Python specifically you won't find much people that aren't self-taught for the simple reason that few schools/universities/college/whatever use python in their course.
First off, check out [Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code). This is what I like about newer-generation languages like **go** and **rust**, where all source code is *defined* as UTF-8 -- unlike Python where you *can* define the encoding in the file -- there's no *fundamental* reason not to use local languages for variable names, etc., which can make it easier to do exactly this. However it's really obvious that the *fiction* and *keywords* used in all these languages derives from English. There's a local equivalent to the base *idea* or **for**, **if**, and **while** in every human language, but imagine how hard it would be to reason about your code if you changed the human language glyph for each such keyword on every sequential usage in a few hundred thousand lines of code. A full translation of the syntax and keywords would be possible with a custom implementation, but even then the *phrasing* would probably be a mismatch, as noun and verb order, modifying context like **in** and **not**, could all be quite difficult to make even remotely natural to a language that doesn't share root ideas with English. Whoever writes an equivalent to Python that's as or more readable and fluent in native Chinese dialects as Python in English is to those for whom Chinese is a first language wins one heck of a user base, though.
The main struggles when learning to program is not the syntax. Yes, you need to ultimately need to express your intentions with the syntax but first you need to learn what idoms are available and what they do, how break you problem into small enough idoms (that are available within the syntax) and how to structure the problem in general. This is usually what needs the most time. At least that was the case when I helped teaching first semesters how to use Java and when I myself learned to program. I learned to program in Basic on an Commodore about 23 years agoand my mother language is German and as far as I remember the English words (which I didn't know where English) where not the problem. And while I was a smart kid I was not a genius. All in all I don't think syntax translation is a solution for a problem .
Delete Facebook too
I'll be your programmer dad ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°), son. But in all seriousness, resources like /r/learnpython where you can ask the dumb questions, as well as a good end goal to motivate you is all you need.
I'm currently working on Scrapy spiders for a few dozen different websites. Does your parsel-cli do something other/better/different than the [`scrapy shell`-command](https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/shell.html#example-of-shell-session)? Perhaps it's just easier for your use case if you use something other than Scrapy?
Also of pandas created another powerful library called Apache Arrow, worthy to check it out!
I posted the output in the README in the repo showing the results from analysising the top 100 posts at the time.
I'm self taught Pythoneer, no CS degree though. I have a degree in Psychology The statistics steered me to Python somehow. I tried learning java first but that was a failure, Python was love at first sight.
All the way except for my dad showing me how to make a .bat file in the 90s
A "hit the gym" issue has already been opened. Just fixed it!
Self taugh. Have never had a single lesson of programming in any school of any type. Am working full time as a Python dev since the age of 20
Yeah, it's definitely flawed. Any data that I collect in the future (should I take the project and further) would have to come with a massive disclaimer that "this is how much /r/relationships likes to mention these key words/phrases, and you can infer that it's probably advice most of the time". But yeah, that's a very real problem. I could have gone for a more complicated approach but (a) I don't know how as I'm a beginner/medium-level Python dev; I'm a frontend dev by trade, mostly working in JavaScript solving web-related issues for a living (and doing all of the other fun stuff that a frontend dev get to do), and (b) I didn't really want to because I was just dicking around for an hour or so and thought that I'd post it on Github for fun :)
[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).
I am! Currently doing the Udacity, MIT Open Courseware, and Learn Python The Hard Way courses.
I've been writing Python for a while but I don't consider myself an expert at all (more like somewhere between beginner and mid-level). The code is super simple, it just does some basic API calls using the awesome PRAW library and then some simple string matching. Glad you've found it useful!
I got a CS minor. Couldn't really hang too well with the advanced "scientific" or "mathematical" topics. I could solve the problems, but I wasn't good at them, and much, much slower than everyone else. So I took my minor, which was Java based, and figured that was the end of that, I wasn't gonna get a job in programming, etc. I set my standards really low as a result of no confidence, and accepted the first helpdesk / frontline support job I could find. I picked up an SQL for Dummies book and got a few Visual Studio tutorials from a nice developer at the company. In two years I went from knowing jack shit fuck all to having made a new company intranet site, all self-taught. Being able to put "two years of SQL, C# and ASP.NET" on my resume with a straight face allowed me to jump from support to sysadmin, and after years of that jump again to the terrifying sounding position of Unix engineer. Now I'm in code most days, with Python as my preferred language. My CS minor gave me a good foundation, but in retrospect I have two observations: 1) the actual content of my CS minor can easily be obtained for free these days. Free courses, public lectures, etc. You can give yourself the equivalent of a degree or a minor if you have some self-discipline. 2) at this point in interviews no one cares about what I studied at university. After the first job as helpdesk, which did have a requirement of having graduated university (with any degree), all subsequent jobs have only asked about skills, self-taught or otherwise. So, that's kinda my story. I've come insanely far on self-taught stuff. It's absolutely worth your time.
I mostly just found the cliches by reading the subreddit quite a lot for trashy drama (similar to watching soap operas, but on the internet). They become obvious once you've been there for a while and read the same replies over and over again :)
That would be awesome! Thanks for the great idea, I thing I am going to do this in the near future. :D
You're absolutely right, thanks. [Fixed!](https://github.com/mrkipling/reddit-relationships-bot/commit/950a3b57250b82e303e0a7ef5f41e0ebe0c838d0)
It's where I go for my morning entertainment.
Chemical engineering, self taught python for numerical analysis, modelling, and other stuff related (or not) to my area. Ended in phd and writing tool for easy physical modelling. 7 years gnu/linux and python experiences. And it feels good :)
[Here is a screencap of the results](http://imgur.com/59wyV9R)
Quite funny... I doubt anyone is able to say "hey I'm programming for 30 years and I'm NOT self taught, I've been spood fed solutions all my life by doing courses". Even less extreme.... when you read someone's blog post about how to do something, you're not really being self taught. Wait a minute... self taught.... don't we all use stackoverflow... with all the great answers out there doing their best to explain everything I would consider no one self taught. Self taught in terms of Python where we can just google all our answers is not really self taught in my opinion.
Look up regular expressions. That might be your best bet.
I have been wondering about this last week as well! I went with "I'm pretty sure it is possible but I don't need to figure that out right now".
That's fairly easy, that line looks the same all the time. First you split on the '=' and take the right part, then you remove the whitespace with strip, then you split on the whitespace again and take the left part, and then you split on '/' and the resulting list contains your answers. That's a very simple way to do it but in this situation it will do.
This seems to be on a higher level I would say... more like to create file C you can only do it if you have B and A. In the case of TS it is more about on a feature level. Correct me if I'm wrong.
whats wrong with standard library unittest library? it's pretty basic admittedly but i think depending on ur needs it would be easier for people to make u suggestions
Whatever languages you learn at university is rarely relevant when you are being employed. The context in which you do programming at university is so different from real life that it hardly matters what you are programming in.
Yea I think it'll eventually come handy and I have too much free time on my hand this summer :)
Yea I realize how dumb my question was. I meant self-taught as in learning how to use without any formal education. As in taking your own time to read through material and figuring everything out.
Aww very good on you!
Very impressive and inspiring!
I currently using [this](http://python.cs.southern.edu/pythonbook/pythonbook.pdf)
Not sure there is a common or idiomatic rule. Consider using "py" prefix or suffix if you are binding an existing library, otherwise just name as you please.
Thanks, gives me some hope for myself!
:) 
Yea Python seems much better to me than others 
Aww ok good to know! Guess I'm not the unicorn i thought I was! Lol
That's a pretty to quality to have
Gateway programming--Gateway drug equivalent for nerds!
I taught myself python over the course of a few days to built a web application in Flask. It was to land a junior developer job while I was in college during my sophomore year. It was really fun to build with compared to the Java and C programming I'd done for class so far. Since then, I've weaseled Python into my jobs one way or another while slowly working my way into really understanding the language. I'm interviewing for some (mostly) Python jobs this summer--hoping I get one!
I would hope so too :0 
Wonderful! 
I would it's definitely easier to learn, especially on your own.
I know where your coming from, I did a very simple task the other day using Python and I was way too proud of myself!
Sweet! 
Nice 
Essentially the same thing I'm doing :)
&gt;:) I am happy that you are happy. Spread the happiness around. [This doggo demands it.](http://i.imgur.com/5BU0H6t.jpg)
Good on you! 
I'd imagine so
Good to know
Kind of I know scratch obviously (it's ok) then I self taught myself dos (.bat) and then Visual Basic (.vb). When I was porting something over to vb my dad showed me how to use c# but it hasn't really stuck. More recently I have been playing with python for school stuff. I can read and understand what code does in most languages. Forgot I also did some java on khan academy 
Not bad at all :)
Fell in love? Can we expect a rom-com anytime soon? :0 
Yea I should of been more specific with my question, I'd meant learning the language outside a formal learning environment. I would count reading stuff online and videos to be self-teaching.
It's either should **HAVE** or should**'VE**, but never should **OF**. See [Grammar Errors](http://www.grammarerrors.com/grammar/could-of-would-of-should-of/) for more information.
If you're eager to learn, you will learn :) and just apply for positions early
I'd meant learning Python outside of a formal education environment
Good points!
Imho being "self-taught" is one of those things that don't really exist but for some reason the term won't die. If you read a blog/book or watch a video or even read the documentation you are still being taught by other people.
Impressive 
I'm in high school right now as well :)
LOL
I probably won't take classes but I will check out the books, thanks!
Wow nice. I'll be 16 in September, I feel old now!
Thanks! If it makes you feel any younger, I'll be 14 in August :P
I'm making a python tkinter socket chat client with embedded games, options, settings, commands, heirarchys and more! It's coming along super nicely, but tkinter's Text() widget is a pain in the ass to control and manipulate other than size (colour is hard for it)
Thanks, I didn't know that sub-reddit existed!Thanks Da...Ahh I mean CrambleSquash! haha
Same asf buddy 
I!
Still miles ahead of me lol. I have a feeling that learning python is going to be an interesting and challenging journey. Loving it so far
I would assume it made learning easier but still kudos to you 
😀
I suppose. Just curious, are you in middle school or starting high school? 
Lots of .replaces basically
I'm going to be starting high school.
I wasn't clear with my question. I meant learning the language outside of a formal learning environment 
Yea that's what I'm trying to do right now
Aww cool. If there's a college prep high school in your area, I'd definitely recommend you try to go there. Since you're already doing so well for yourself, having those college credits as soon as you get out of high school would really come handy. 
How can I not after seeing that 😍
Well I hope you do too! 
I want to use it like this: some normal sphinx doc text .. python:: print(some_function_returning_valid_sphinx_code()) more normal sphinx text I have not yet a specific example but I want to write code in a directive that produces output to be rendered by Sphinx. Kind of what you can do with [orgmode](http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-python.html)
I learnt Python 3 to begin with cause I'm different.
The usual choices are unittest (standard library), nose, or pytest. Each package will have documentation describing how to set up tests and run them. They should all have a way to run/discover tests from any directory structure you want. If this seems like a lot of boilerplate to you then I'm sorry, but it should help organize things in the future. Some of the libraries above and others try to simplify writing tests, you could look at those. Lastly, you shouldn't be committing your pycache directory. Also, if you are writing a python package your directory structure is a little off compared to the typical model.
Do you learn from: 1. detailed tutorials? 2. reference information (like generated documentation) 3. self-contained 'hello world' style examples?
Using tox to manage the virtualenvs
Most people that do CS were figuring out the basics before they started CS. Education takes a lot of time but will give a higher level understanding in a small area. There's still plenty for CS students to figure out on themselves. I guess indeed you are more interested in the question "how much of your *own* time do you spend on python and its frameworks". :)
Good luck man, it'll be worth it in the end! :) One more tip: find something that interests you and code stuff related to it; for me it was games, I started by creating mods for Source engine (I *loved* CS:GO), and later when I started playing League of Legends I created my own game tracker using the game's public API.
Eventually you get to the point where you have to use that knowledge and learn as you go and from experience, regardless of how you first learned it.
Thanks, I'll look for that. So far I seem to just get 'error running' messages with everything I try. 
Omg I love League. I would be a much more productive human if it wasn't for League! But thanks for the advice, I do have a lot of interest in video games and that's probably what I'll do 
NB: nose is in maintenance mode and shouldn't be used any more - go for pytest or plain old unittest.
It does, and it's seriously good! If anything the beginner questions are the best to ask there because more people can/ wants to answer them. 
Thanks. Honestly didn't know that because I haven't had to modify my testing framework away from my usuals: unittest and pytest.
Self taught a few languages, followed by a CS degree, followed by more self taught languages because a CS degree really doesn't require any programming skills.
No one ever taught me python, but I do have a CS degree.

I am self-taught as well. I started with a book "Head First Python". It was awesome. After that, it was mostly online through various youtube videos. Writing lots and lots of code helped me. I used to take up small projects that are simple and try implementing that in python. With newer concepts that I would learn, I would try to do another project using that. I have been blogging for a few years now on Python and machine learning: https://sourcedexter.com I have pushed some of my projects to Github as well: https://github.com/akshaypai 
What helped me a TON getting started was this video from PyCon 2014 [Ned Batchelder: Getting Started Testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxSsnHeWQBY). He also has the [slides and code available](https://nedbatchelder.com/text/test0.html).
Your example shows 16 lines of code for the test. I wouldn't consider that a massive amount of boilerplate. Test code can rival the size of the codebase itself, this is why companies hire people solely for that sometimes. The standard unittest and mock libraries are all you'll need most of the time. There are very specific reasons why the encapsulation within classes and such is used. Watch [Getting Started Testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxSsnHeWQBY) for some best practices.
I've self-taught every language I've ever learned, starting 30 years ago as a young boy. Picked up python a few years ago at my current position. I have a CS degree too but by then I had been programming for a while already.
Okay, I've just released logzero v1.1.0 which has exactly this functionality: https://logzero.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#i-logzero-logger Thanks for your input! And please let me know if you have any other suggestions.
Since logzero uses the standard Python logger objects, it's easy to add custom handlers. I've just added a documentation about how to use a RotatingFileHandler for instance: https://logzero.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#adding-custom-handlers-eg-rotatinglogfile Please let me know if you have any ideas for an API to make this setup even simpler when using `logzero`!
It's a very java-y API, it's hard to compose test cases/setups and until Python 2.7/3.2 there was no bundled discovery mechanism so you had to do a lot of setup to run your tests (and people may not be aware that `python -munittest discover` is now a thing) (op does not seem to be since they still have a hand-rolled runner and thus have to fuck around with the path)
Thanks for the feedback! Please just open issues when you have any kind of feedback and/or ideas!
It's either lot **HAVE** or lot**'VE**, but never lot **OF**. See [Grammar Errors](http://www.grammarerrors.com/grammar/could-of-would-of-should-of/) for more information.
Dude that rule doesn't apply here. Lot have doesn't even make sense.
Go home, bot. You're drunk. There are a lot of exceptions to your rule. 
OP: Since 2.7/3.2 `unittest` has a test discovery system. However it will only recurse through packages. So here's a working version (check out the `discover` command to see if you want a different layout depending on the structuring of your package): python_unittest |-- __init__.py |-- tests | |-- __init__.py | `-- test_whatthehell.py `-- whatthehell.py where the only change aside from adding `python_unittest/tests/__init__.py` is that your test file becomes: import unittest from ..whatthehell import MyTestClass class MyTestClassTests(unittest.TestCase): def test_times2(self): n = MyTestClass(37) self.assertIs(n.times2(), 37*2) to run, $ python -munittest discover -t . python_unittest from the parent directory. Alternatively you can run a single module or file without using the discovery system: $ python -munittest python_unittest.tests.test_whatthehell Personally I'd recommend following /u/breamoreboy's suggestion and skipping unittest straight to pytest, while it's internally more complicated the user/developer interface is fantastic and it makes much better use of the strengths of Python as a language than unittest 
Very impressive!
Any prebuilt log format templates that can go straight to any plotting libs too would be useful. Because you know, I can't think of doing it right till the 200th iteration of something useful for plotting/graphing 
I'm sure it'll come handy for me
It is kinda funny though seeing the difference though in evolution of the engineers vs the software guys/gals. Engineers want documentation (there is some, but you need to know where to look and what to look for). They don't want to touch the code more than they have to. Single function program are standard. Software folk start out wanting to reorganize things to use objects and overhaul the code.
lotta. Dat guy's gotta lotta ballsa.
Thanks for the links, I'll be sure to check em out
Something catchy and descriptive. Flutter for some web-related thing is a terrible name to an aerospace engineer who does flutter. Also, don't name your package company.category.library (e.g., google.aero.flutter). It makes for nasty packaging, though I suspect google could manage.
I'm just trying to get numpy to install on Qpython3. No version I specify to pip works, and I seem to be missing several icons, including Qpypi, from the program's main screen. It is becoming quite bothersome.
Yup and likely always will be. Death notices are usually paid for nowdays. Structured data they are not. Also, if you start scraping my site you better have a serious rate limit on it.
I feel as though your comment implies it's a binary choice and there's nothing further from the truth. Even if you are formally trained in Python that training will never cover everything. From the language through the ecosystem. Everyone who writes Python beyond 'Hello World' has likely learned something through a focused effort in their search for a solution. So yes - most programmers using Python (and this isn't exclusive to the language) are self-taught in some aspect, some library, some algorithm, etc. That's my perspective on programming in general however. If you're not continually learning beyond your core you're likely missing out. 
Instead of separate list of class-urls, you can collect them in a bucket as you go. class bucket: urls=() bucket.urls=('/','index') class index: def GET(self): etc etc bucket.urls+=('/goto:(.*)','goto') class goto: def GET(self,s): etc etc bucket.urls+=('/kartta_(.*)','kartta') class kartta: etc etc bucket.urls+=('/up','up') class up: etc etc if __name__ == "__main__": app = web.application(bucket.urls, globals()) app.run() 
Not that I like the bot or anything, but this is grammatically correct: "There are many people here; a lot have ice cream". It's awkward as hell, but it does work. 
Start by using python 3. You can't fix unicode errors effectively in Python 2. Often it takes rearchitecting your program to only use bytes or unicode at specific types of boundaries. The problem with Python 2 is that is can convert your data multiple times before it ultimately crashes. In Python 3, you are forced to get it right.
&gt; Your example shows 16 lines of code for the test. I wouldn't consider that a massive amount of boilerplate. It is though. Using pytest the file would be 3 lines long.
Thanks comment removed.
Thanks, I'll look into it. Good luck on your programming journeys, and if you can't seem to find an answer to a problem you're having, you can message me. 
Should of stuck to just "could", "would", and "should".
It's either should **HAVE** or should**'VE**, but never should **OF**. See [Grammar Errors](http://www.grammarerrors.com/grammar/could-of-would-of-should-of/) for more information.
That's a nifty site, tech.io
Super nice! That's exactly the API I wish the standard library had.
:P
Self taught. Been using it for sixteen years now.
&gt; This is an interesting move from NSA. I thought so too. There are some fairly interesting tools that they have open-sourced. 
Maybe such a thing exists but I think you would be better off choosing a good Python tutorial and go through it.
The company that i work for does the same thing. Every time we have an update for the app we need to build, package, and upate hundreds of apps. I've been looking for a way to automate this process using python. The android apps are almost tackled and now i'm are looking for a way to do the same for the iOS apps. Can you share your thoughts on combining Python and fastlane? I would love to see your findings and source. -GK
 import os import sys cwd = os.getcwd() sys.path.append(cwd + '/../') from test_testing.whatthehell import MyTestClass At least some of that is setting up path stuff and imports that would be needed with pytest anyway, and even [that package seems to encourage putting tests into logical classes.](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html#grouping-multiple-tests-in-a-class) You're right though, in this particular contrived case it would be less lines, if not less work. I'm unsure if that's a strong enough reason to introduce a new dependency into your project over the standard libs. I haven't fully compared the two approach's features though, so perhaps I'm missing important use cases.
Your uWSGI config file is using "--wsgi-file main.py" which, I assume is the entry point for the Flask application and not the "worker.py" file you've added. This means that increasing the number of uWSGI processes will increase how many parallel requests you can process with your Flask app and has no relation to redis. In terms of scaling, it's going to depend on what part of the stack needs to grow. Are you receiving too many HTTP requests? Then try increasing the number of uWSGI processes. Is the redis queue getting backed up with jobs and not being processed fast enough? Then try increasing the number of worker processes instead. You still have plenty of space to scale vertically (bigger box) since those specs are on the low end. However, if you want to scale horizontally across multiple boxes, it will depend on which of the two scenarios above you're attempting to address. If you're scaling the uWSGI processes, you'll want to use ELB with the auto scaling group to bring up more web boxes to handle the increase in traffic. If you're scaling the redis worker processes, you'll want to use a process monitor, such as supervisor, and spin up multiple redis worker processes in parallel per box. If these are CPU/resource intensive, consider putting them in a separate AMI or autoscaling group so they can be scaled independent of the web boxes. 
&gt; At least some of that is setting up path stuff Any relevant path information (if necessary which should not be the case) can be provided to the CLI (directly or via an ini file). Though you are right that one of the imports remains necessary, my bad. &gt; and even that package seems to encourage putting tests into logical classes. Eh. It says that it often makes sense, but you don't have to agree, and you don't have to use classes if you don't want to. Also note that you can use the pytest runner with regular unittest tests.
&gt; Python courses are rarely even offered at university level. If you disagree, you need to provide the citation. https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/index.htm
Interesting.... 
Thanks for the tip? How do I also get the standard deviation of each of the asset given that when I use numpy ".std() method", by default it uses the mean as the deviating factor. Does numpy's ".std() method" have the same parameters to force it to use er1 or er2 as the deviating factor?
I got the impression (not sure where from) that web.py was dead. Cool to see it still kicking. 
Today I learned that the asterisk can be called the *splat* operator. Good site, helpful quick introduction to some important ideas; glad for the slide-in of a contextually appropriate introduction of **lru_cache** in the context of *decorators* ... would love to see a few more items added from **functools** (esp. **partial**), as I feel it gets overlooked (along with **operator**), but, otherwise, sharp and to the point!
Oh shut up. I do not need to provide a citation for that.
I think it is not a question of 'why (not)' but 'when'. Specifically when is the right time to start optimizing? As /u/bixmix pointed out programmers aren't necessarily adroit in writing business logic in the language of databases. If a team does not have someone who can write the same logic as fast or faster in SQL than Python (or what ever languages), it is probably best to go-with-what-you-know to get the end-to-end system working. If it turns out that the business logic is an impediment and can be resolved by a different implementation, then it makes sense to look at other options. However impediments are a character of some goal, not a thing unto themselves. For example, getting the code to run and being able to scale to more users are distinct goals that might have the same challenges but happen at different times in the software lifecycle. It is consideration of the 'premature optimization problem'. I have seen a lot of projects die because developers want to play with some new pet technology and argue the case with 'optimization' even though there is no evidence there is an efficiency problem. This isn't to say that writing logic inside the database is incorrect or 'worse than'. It's just timing.
Don't know the Java equivalents, but I think here is the full list, anyone chime in if I missed any. import, from, class, def, while, for, in, is, pass, return, yield, break, continue, try, except, finally, if, elif, else, and, or, not. And if you're in python 2: print
I didn't say you should provide a citation. I was providing a citation for the claim that Python courses at University level aren't all that rare. The thing you requested a citation for.
I wish Matlab was like $1000. There are toolboxes that are $10k for a single license and you need to buy multiple of those toolboxes and you need to pay maintenance for them to get the bug fixes. Then if you build on that, you lo lock customers into that scheme... You can use Python in Matlab though. Suck it optimization and signal processing toolboxes :)
Sorry I don't have the time to hammer it quickly, but don't forget exponential back off. First retry after 10 secondd, then 20, then 40,... In the case of a connection that fails due to an overloaded network, this avoids contributing to the problem.
hey, this was a fun thing to play with. weird thing I noticed was that the ordering of the elements in the json tree was different in their execution than when I ran it in my interpreter offline. 
Wait, those are all the keywords? That's it?
What version of python are you using? Dict ordering isn't guaranteed ever, and the hashing I'm pretty sure has changed across versions. 3.6 actually has ordered dicts, but it's only guaranteed for function kwargs and could be dropped in the future for normal dicts.
Nice and concise list of useful python tools everyone should know about! Thanks for sharing.
Continuing writing my basic text based RPG game. Oh and learning Java. 
correct me if im wrong because im relatively new to python but i believe there are actually a lot of pythonistas who write their tests directly above each method using stdlib's doctest. personally i find it pretty neat because it sets up a nice habit of documenting with examples that serve as tests also, but i havent had the chance to try it on any new project. i think its worth looking into tho.

I'll say this in my experience, you're going to get a lot of clutter and nonsense. Feed it well with as many lines from Reddit as you can. Otherwise it's going to look ridiculous. Which is still funny but a different kind of funny.
nose2 is what spun out of nose and it seems less hackish than pytest in my limited experience.
&gt;TLDR: Altair (declarative visualisation) is super useful! Altair's solution looks pretty nice for a scatter plot. But that isn't enough. This is not how one should plot a boxplot: https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/errorbar_aggregate.html 
Two things: First, you're looking for r/learnpython. Second, we'll remove your post if you just copy it over there, because it doesn't have nearly enough information for us to help you. What resources have you looked at? What is your current code? What have you tried, and what roadblocks are you running into? Include those when you post, and we'll be glad to get you running.
Yeah but you wouldn't say "we are doing a lot have testing today"
Python is a tiny language really, I don't see how you could be annoyed at looking up keywords. Have you never used any other language besides Java before? There are quite a few builtins that are not keywords but might look like them to a Java coder. Like most types, filter, map etc
The creator should put this on the stickermule marketplace ! Share link so they can benefit from this awesome art via small % and make it convenient for people buying. Beautiful work!
The presentation here seems really good but I didn't know why at first. Upon looking over the subjects though, these just seem to fit together with each other very well. It's a small handful of essential intermediate knowledge you can build on. The action/satisfaction of being able to run the code is pretty nice.
Have event_x (I guess event_x is a hardware signal?) trigger an interrupt that you bind to your callback.
You're definitely right; it's a context issue. The bot's running on keywords, but my point was there is a context where "lot have" does make grammatical sense.
This can be a very limited use case for beginners but ultimately you. Red to learn English for programming. It's English all the way down to the definition of the CPU architecture. No way are we translating it all. 
You probably want to ask over at [r/raspberry_pi](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/). I have completed projects with power switching and would probably recommend using a [relay](https://www.amazon.com/Tolako-Arduino-Indicator-Channel-Official/dp/B00VRUAHLE/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1499015977&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=arduino+relay). You can still use python to turn the relay off and on... And it's kinda the whole point of using a pi for this type of project. Here is an [example project] (https://elementztechblog.wordpress.com/2014/09/09/controlling-relay-boards-using-raspberrypi/) (not mine)... Alternatively, you could use a [pump like this](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1150) combined with a motor controler you would get much more precision over the flow.
good point, though I was thinking that the hierarchical structure may have allowed for more consistency in this case...likely lack of coffee at work there. ...and this is 2.7.x 
No. I know tons of great coders who are formally trained. They just have to be interested about the subject to be great I think. How you got the basic education isn't very relevant if you've got that. 
There were literally no replaces
Python 3 wasn't really much before 3.4, and didn't start to become big until 3.5. 
ping_results = second_line.split(" ")[3].split("/") Access each result with ping_results[#] where # = 1 -&gt; min, 2 -&gt; avg, 3 -&gt; max, 4 -&gt; mdev What do you mean by error running messages?
I agree. This example looks incredibly complex! If only there was a one-size-fits-all library! 
I prefer library names without a "py". It gives no extra information about the library. I already know it's a Python library. Same goes for libraries that end in "lib".
Thank you, there are indeed some great functions in `functools`! Feel free to contribute, the git is here: https://github.com/CodinGame/advanced-python-features-playground
I never understood this aversion to namespaces. It's a simple way to avoid name clashes on PyPI. Of course, before i did Python I was a Java programmer (com.organization.so.many.nested.levels), and I started Python programming for Zope and Plone (who are really big on namespaces). However, organization.library is quite sufficient for my package name needs.
I'm talking about that name for a single library. I love namespaces, but that style breaks things like pyInstaller.
Also, what exactly is it you are trying to accomplish?
I put your question into Google and got an answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8423895/using-argparse-in-conjunction-with-sys-argv-in-python?noredirect=1
Why don't you want tests in a subdirectory?
http://evmorov.github.io/lang-compare/java-python/
Great info and examples! 
Wow, thanks!
stream=True is probably referring to a stream of data, try looking at this example on github with opencv (assuming you are looking at using this for face detection) https://gist.github.com/thearn/5562029
Really liked It !
https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html and for all of your other needs to look up in the standard library, the reference itself: https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html If you're already familiar programming in another language, you should probably start at the "Library Reference" section of the documentation on python.org.
They are not accepting new designs any more. 
Python is becoming ( or already is ) what is taught in intro classes.
I came here to say this.
&gt; correct me if im wrong because im relatively new to python but i believe there are actually a lot of pythonistas who write their tests directly above each method using stdlib's doctest. That's really rare in my experience. It's convenient for *examples* in order to ensure they actually work (though the debugging experience is pretty dire when it breaks), but it doesn't really work for actual non-trivial tests.
This bot should of course be taken offline for a while. 
This is dirty ...
Really liking this **techio** format, and having quite a few ideas myself. One thing that might be worth explaining is that the **else** clause fires even if the body of the loop was never entered (say with an empty iterative being passed as an argument), or if the loop otherwise ran to completion without ever encountering a **break** or **return**. Not the most universally useful feature of the language, but a bit of a surprise if you never see it. def actor(*lines): for line in lines: print(line) else: print("... and, scene!") return True Never seen it used but to comic effect.
That worked fine! :) Thanks I just don't get what do you mean by 'string representation of the object'.. Why does the function name matter?
How to control the device from python depends on what kind of USB interface it uses. For example, some USB relays I found show up as a serial port and you write the text strings "on" and "off" to the port to control it. Or it could be something custom and you would send raw USB commands using something like [PyUsb](https://walac.github.io/pyusb/). The documentation for your device should give some hint on that, even if there's just some windows software they provide. If your device did not come with documentation or software, you probably have a pump that is USB-powered but *not USB controlled*. I'm not sure about the raspberry pi, but most computers don't have a good way to control power to the USB ports.
Every object has a string that describes what the object is. This is represented by the object's `__str__()` method. When you pass an object to the `print()` statement, the object's `__str__()` method is called, and the string that is returned is then printed out to the console. If you haven't yet grasped it, the benefit of using `__str__()` over a user-defined method is that you don't have to call the method first before using print. The below shows this: Printing a vector using a user-defined method: &gt;&gt;&gt; x = Vector([1, 2, 3]) &gt;&gt;&gt; print x.toString() (1,2,3) Printing a vector using the `__str__()` special method: &gt;&gt;&gt; x = Vector([1, 2, 3]) &gt;&gt;&gt; print x (1,2,3) Can you see the difference? With `__str__()`, you don't call the method, you just print the object directly.
The default dict as a tree and outputted as JSON blew my mind. 
After seeing the success of the playground about advanced python features, I got the motivation to write a short article about for...else. It's very easy, just a markdown and a python file for each example. That's indeed interesting to note and I'm glad it's behaving like that.
Learning about generators and the yield keyword might give you an idea how to structure things on the low level.
Decided to pick up on Python during my spare time, and holy moly, it's the most elegant language I have ever used yet. I am absolutely in love. I used the Tweepy API and Heroku to make this happen!
fabric is something python (2.7) based to do tasks like this, though might not be as much fun, as it does all the ssh connecting for you.
Yeah, I like the whole idea of the playground, especially after looking at their default template and seeing how that trick with checking for idiomatic -- but not necessarily obvious -- function calls works. And you can set up whatever Docker container you want. Won't have time in the next little while, but considering the number of times I have to explain *with* file opening or why **never** *except:* should darken your code, this is really an exciting find.
The pythonic way would be to use map and any (or something out of the collections module): any(map((a, b, c), lambda i: 0 &lt;= i &lt;= 1))) [1] It's a 1-liner where you're only writing the condition check once (which I think is what your goal is), and can easily expand "what" you're checking. Otherwise there is no syntax short hand for 0 &lt;= a, b, c &lt;= 1 that I know of. [1] I may have my arguments mixed up from map(), I'm writing this on mobile.
What sort of set up do you have? Do you use the Designer? I ask cause I'm working on something using pycharm as an editor and qtdesigner to generate gui elements which I then wrap in widgets I can edit. Debugging is a bit of a pain though, I can never see the attributes of the Qt objects I'm actually interested in.. how do you work?
That would be: all(0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1 for x in a, b, c)
Light grey text on a white page. Awesome. 😐
Yeah I actually looked at Fabric and also did some basic testing with Ansible as well. I think Ansible is a great fit for this but I couldn't get it working as expected and need to spend some more time with Ansible. I actually got this fully working but went with the simple option of time.sleep(xx) I can post a link to my GitHub Gist if interested but it's not very elegant code.
As somebody who knows little about the subject, why not?
That's kind of a large question. In essence it's because convolutions are for exploiting data where the same features are to be recognised over smaller local regions of the 'signal'. They are independent (roughly). In language processing you are still feeding in a sequence, but one with enormous dependency along it. As such recurrent nets are the more appropriate formulation.
My first project on PyPI: Used minimax to make this game to play it when I'm bored. I wanted it to be very simple, so just used Command line. Added an option to display winning chance per available box. 2 player mode available too. Installation: pip install tic_tac_toe (Underscore between tic,tac and tac,toe) Any feedback regarding the game/code is welcome!
This doesn't relate to python at all. If you want to ask a question about how to create something similar please go to r/learnpython.
It's useful in CRUD applications if you're iterating over rows in a database. An automatic catch on "0 rows returned" is helpful.
I remember seeing a presentation about something like this at BYU while I was there a few years ago. They were taking in obituaries and parsing out as much structured data as they could (names and relationships of people mentioned, places of birth, wedding, death, etc.) Though I'm not sure if it was one of the CS professors from BYU, or someone from a different university who came to present their research. You could probably contact the BYU CS department and see if they can put you in contact with said person, or maybe one of the professors who do similar NLP research.
I'm in Atlanta. Is this position still open?
yes, I know of all and any, but assumed there might be even a shorter way. Anyway, I'll take it! btw, I assume you meant &gt;for x in [a,b,c] at the end there?
I'm not yet an expert in python, so others might be able to give you better advice. All I would say is you already know a lot of concepts, much more than what is needed to get started on any project. So just start working on any single project in python. If you aren't sure, pick something as simple as notes manager, where using command line, user has option to add notes, delete them, etc. Through this you'll learn command line arguments, documentation, uploading project to PyPI, version control using git(if you haven't done that already) If you were looking for a more sophisticated advice, I apologise, but start working on something. All the best
http://unicode.org/reports/tr18/#word - I assume that last line in your expected-output consists of several words, without any whitespace between them. Is that a grapheme cluster? Does `r"\bg".split()` do what you want?
Why are you learning python? 
Im writing a simple tool that automatically created unit tests for me (pytest) https://github.com/Hellowlol/asserted I have no idea if it gonna pan out but it has been really helpful writing tests for a API I'm working on.
As i mentioned, at first it looked very clean,and it has a big culture, the zen of python and the whole PEP8 convention ,and i really like it. But i dont have any particular reason or something i want to build with it.
Python re module doesn't support unicode characters that well in regex character groups. You need to either explicitly list needed characters within square brackets (e.g. "[\u0900-\u097F]", but you want to google something like "hindi regex" to find your range) or install "[regex](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/regex/)" module where this is fixed (it's backwards-compatible so no need to rewrite anything).
&gt;what do you mean by error running messages Where I fail to edit the code properly and it doesn't run. including the code you posted above. res = subprocess.call(["ping", "8.8.8.8", "-c3","-q"]) ping_results = res.split(" ")[3].split("/") print(ping_results) 
Thanks man 👍🏽
I forgot False, None, True, as, assert, del, global, lambda, nonlocal, raise, with. One of the other comments linked the full list.
No, it's a good bot. It knows. The of-bot however, doesn't.
&gt; for x in [a,b,c] or `(a,b,c)` 
I'm not convinced you know anything about python.
do you have any examples of anything you've made? Or can you describe anything you've done that isn't a list of nothing?
Yes, or parenthesized `for x in (a, b, c) `. I'm fairly sure there isn't a shorter way of writing it, bar using libraries like numpy. 
Did you consider http://werkzeug.pocoo.org ?
You don't need that map at all, just `any(0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1 for x in (1, 2, 3))`
thanks for sharing!
I'd call myself an expert after coding in Python for 10 years, but if you know lambda and whatever coperhantions is, you don't need me to teach you.
Should of seen that coming.
It's either should **HAVE** or should**'VE**, but never should **OF**. See [Grammar Errors](http://www.grammarerrors.com/grammar/could-of-would-of-should-of/) for more information.
&gt; But i dont have any particular reason or something i want to build with it. So why do you want to learn it? That's not what you say if you want someone to invest time into you.
Main site talks about how to get it and who is using it, but I suggest adding a section about why I would choose this over Flask/Django. That's the first thing I want to know, and I feel like the landing page should tell me.
Autohotkey? https://autohotkey.com/ Easy enough to learn and lots of examples available
Ah, I was assuming that the person you replied to saying "Lot have doesn't even make sense" meant specifically in this context.
S'all good, I wasn't as clear as I could have been. Cheers!
Without brackets, things separated by commas become tuples. # swap values in two variables x, y = y, x This makes a tuple with the values currently in (y, x), then unpacks it into the tuple of assignable variables (x, y). 
django: everything included flask: do-it-yourself pyramid: start small and scale up
Played around a little to see if I could get something to work. Using subprocess.call will literally just call the command but won't bother to get the output. The function we actually want to use here is subprocess.check_output (easy debug is to just print res before we actually try and do anything). So if we do res = subprocess.check_output(["ping", "8.8.8.8", "-c3", "-q"]) res2 = res.split("\n") print(res2) We should now see each of the result lines as an element of the res2 list. Now you can do what we did before on one of those lines ping_results = res2[2].split(" ")[3].split("/") print(ping_results) (I am just guessing at 2 judging by the output we were given, but it could be different - choose according to what prints when you print res2). Let me know if this works or not and we can look at what else we need to do!
Oh man, i get it! It's like if there's a standard method to 'tag' an object.. So print() function always uses the `__str__()` return value Man, i feel so dumb xD You are good ;) Btw, in codewars 'best solutions' the guys are using other methods with the `'__'` thing.. like `__len__()` and `__iter__()`.. I guess `__str__` isn't the only standard method.. Thanks a lot ;)
Yeah who cares about readability right?
That runs, but isn't giving the right result. res2 (in a single line now) : ['PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.', '', '--- 8.8.8.8 ping statistics ---', '3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2002ms', 'rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 7.677/17.522/24.490/7.160 ms', ''] ping_results: ['statistics'] 
You could come up with some basic rules to parse out data most of the data from the paragraph. I've something like this with processing Bills and vote tallies for the openStates.org project which had the same problem(human generated text describing an event). People *basically* use the same words and sentence structure, keyword splitting works for a surprisingly large amount of time. There will always be some margin of error though with this method. What you really would need is a machine learning process to get the data out which would be more precise over time. The method that u/autotldr uses to generate summarized text is probably pretty close in terms of the word weighting. You might be able to take its algorithm's basic flow(http://smmry.com/about) and try to apply it with static rules/parsers if you do not have any experience with ML. No matter which method, you will need to know if you are getting good results. This repo, https://github.com/chadwickbureau/obituaries, should be helpful since good labor free training data is always hard to come by. The folders contain the printed obituary and a file with the correctly data that the obituary contains(Family, age, death, etc).
Gnucash plus my Python invoice generator https://github.com/n1ywb/jeffs-gnucash-utils
In this case (`all(...)`), parentheses are necessary. Without them, Python assumes they are function arguments and throws a syntax error: SyntaxError: Generator expression must be parenthesized if not sole argument
I have been using xlwings for couple years, even before it was merged with UDFs from ExcelPython. Together with openpyxl, this makes Python an excellent alternative to VBA for Excel add-ins, macros, and UDFs.

Doesn't Gmail require OAuth 2.0 now days to work? I don't think this code works with Gmail anymore
using that in api tests for quite some time now, very handy.
First thought: 'I have no idea what this bot does'. Both readme file and this thread give 0 information on what the bot actually does. And very few people will try to read through that single file to figure that out.
The main question here is "Why?". Why should I learn one more web framework instead of using [whatever I'm using now]. Unless it has a killer feature, I'm not going to use it over [whatever I'm using now] . No clear selling point. 
&gt; ping_results = res2[2].split(" ")[3].split("/") Switch it to ping_results = res2[4].split(" ")[3].split("/") print(ping_results) I was way off on how the list from splitting the output would come out, oops! 
Never use this. It's a land mine your successor will step on. 
I am currently working through [Python Testing with pytest](https://pragprog.com/book/bopytest/python-testing-with-pytest). I'm only a few chapters in, but it's really helping me wrap my mind around testing. 
I'm surprised web.py is still alive. Who's the current maintainer since Aaronsw is gone
ping_results now prints as : ['11.518', '11.919', '12.177', '0.287'] Now I just need to get the 11.919 or the 12.177 by themselves. I've looked at a ton of examples of using split online and still can't figure it out...
When we use .split() it just converts it into a list, so if you mean just one of those numbers themselves as the element you can access it by doing print(ping_results[1]) for 11.919 or print(ping_results[2]) for 12.177
Interesting. I think that would be a very neat addition to stuff like codewars. You could have a class controlling some robots or something and the robots might be dancing one way, and you'd have to make them walk in a line or something. Tbh though I saw the title of your post and thought this was going to be about manipulating the stack with the `ast` module or something, which is very fun 
I've never heard of code wars, I will check that out to see what it is all about!
Code wars is a lot of fun. There's a lot of challenge sites like it but it's my favorite. It's not really what you're after though since it usually makes you write code from scratch 
Even still, if it will improve my skills, Im going to at least see what it is like lol. Thanks for the tip!
It looks like it starts the break at [0]. [2] was the max ping. [1] is the average. I can see the first part splits the ping information up into 4 groups(5?) by using the line break ("\n") This is confusing me: ping_results = res2[4].split(" ")[3].split("/") Thanks for all the help by the way. 
Oh my bad. Sorry didn't realize this is a Python forum.
Thank you, I will check it out.
You've had a lot of replies but I'll throw in my two cents. At your age python is a good place to start. It's generic enough to be applicable to many different systems, very popular in the industry, and for the most part pretty forgiving. Unlike something like Javascript where you have to really understand async, or C++ where you have to give a shit about memory management. Python will let you get your feet wet. See if you like it. The best piece of advice I can give someone 22 years younger than me... always keep growing in breath and depth of knowledge. When you look at code you wrote a year ago you should think it's shit. That's a good thing! Good luck!
 The command is `for name in people:`. That command steps through the iterable "people" and assigns "name" to each value in the iterable one by one. A common thing to put after that is a print statement: for name in people: print(name) Which will print every name in the "people" list one by one. --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython.

Oh ok. Thanks for the help and link to the other subreddit.
What does one of the invoices look like? Do you have a screenshot of the html/pdf?
Yup, objects have many special methods - `__str__` is just one.
[It's not dead](https://github.com/webpy/webpy/commits/master) but it is a micro framework so don't expect any massive activity.
&gt; web.py was originally published while Aaron Swartz worked at reddit.com, where the site used it as it grew to become one of the top 1000 sites according to Alexa and served millions of daily page views. "It's the anti-framework framework. web.py doesn't get in your way," explained founder Steve Huffman. (The site was rewritten using other tools after being acquired by Condé Nast.) I can't say I'd want to be technologically associated with that era of reddit. It was incredibly unstable and unreliable.
I am surprised that discovery mode is a new thing. Maybe it's because I never wrote any code prior to py 2.7 (facepalm)
Very nice indeed, just tried using yaml instead of json (I find it a bit more human friendly) and had to write a quick function to replace the defaultdicts with regular dicts but still pretty straight forward!
Yeah, scipy and pyramids both are great names. 
pytest is the best. I love that you can just use the builtin asserts. Here's a tutorial: Put `test_` before your functions and filenames. Use `assert`. Run `pyest` from terminal 
This will work for gmail, I have scripts setup with my companies google apps and my personal gmail but I use app passwords instead of my actual password.

I think operator is overlooked because it's cumbersome to use. In the vast majority of cases I'd rather use a quick lambda than bother with operator.
A `[]` means a list; a `()` means a tuple. I think you are asking how to convert a list to a tuple? Use the `tuple` function: &gt;&gt;&gt; tuple(["14", "4", "7", "8", "5"]) ('14', '4', '7', '8', '5') --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython.

I made a 'datetime.date'-like wrapper for the oldschool [util-linux ddate](http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/ddate1.html) since I wanted to fool around with C bindings over the weekend.

Also I'd love to know if people had different problems based on their platform/interpreter. https://github.com/dashdanw/ddate-python
Just out of curiosity, what subreddit did you mean to post to/think this subreddit was?
I'm fully self-taught is the sense that I haven't learn gone to college. Started my own company during high school as a standard web dev and have developed my skills (and the company) over time to handle much more complex environments.
I'll admit it's cumbersome for a quick or single item uses, but for *metaprogramming* it can be incredibly useful (**methodcaller**), it can really help with complex sorting (**itemgetter** and **attrgetter**), and when doing lots of filtering and mapping with **itertools** or a series of generator comprehension the explicit operator calls are much more readable and efficient than lots and lots and lots of lambda declarations.
Thanks for the lesson, I learned a lot! Big ups 🙌 Seems like a Medium for developers. This is awesome 🎊
So, OP is obviously a total beginner. And with a question like this it's worth it to read between the lines and try to figure out what OP is really asking or what it is they are trying to do. Your answer certainly helped them moving on but they didn't learn anything. You could have asked why OP is trying to do that or at least pointed out what the main differences between those data structures are. Teach a person to fish, you know.
&gt; I am surprised that discovery mode is a new thing. Well it's not really new at this point given 2.7 is now 7 years old, but yeah there was no autodiscovery/autorun system before 2.7/3.2, which is a significant reason for the existence of Nose (and possibly pytest as well).
Read up about lists and tuples. This will do the trick - print(tuple(["14", "4", "7", "8", "5"])) Also - /r/learnpython is a better place to ask.
In my experience it helps a total beginner more to reach an immediate goal. But go ahead and teach your way, buddy. Op will certainly benefit from several answers. Plenty of room here for both our methods. 
Awww thanks man, all good advice! 
Great work! Do you care about sharing the code?
Considering my circumstances I'm thinking of doing something along those lines!
I had to rewrite a json export script from a collegue with very basic python skills. My plan was just to make it clean. Ended up with a strong "THIS IS AWESOME! WHY HAVEN'T I USED THAT BEFORE?! THERE IS SO MUCH POSSIBILITY!!!"-feeling.
It's not time efficient at all and pretty much requires you to live at home while you get rolling. But it's so much fun :)
I'm currently stuck in Pakistan for a good couple of years and besides school and working out I don't have much to do, so something like this could be manageable for me 😀
Then totally go for it. Try to get a client as early as possible, and try to learn while working :) Also, I very much recommend local clients to start with.
Good to know, thank you very much! :)
I feel like every time a post show me how nice is Altair to use, it takes the use-case where Altair suit well, but I have never seen someone write about the limits...
Hi /u/junyoung95 I don't think it's a good idea to turn a list into a tuple just for display purpose, especially if you have large lists. The use of a data structure should not be made regarding the way it is displayed in by the python interpreter, but only regarding the logic of your process. One simple war to do it could be to use the join and the format built-in functions: numbers = ["14", "4", "7", "8", "5"] pretty_display = '({})'.fomat(', '.join(numbers)) Actually it's far more faster that the tuple conversion on large lists. from timeit import timeit numbers = [str(i) for i in range(100000)] stmt_with_tuple = """str(tuple(numbers))""" stmt_with_format = ""'({})'.format(', '.join(numbers))""" timeit(stmt_with_tuple, number= 1000, globals=globals()) #7.332660471000054 seconds timeit(stmt_with_format, number=1000, globals=globals()) #1.6299744810003176 seconds 
I don't mind at all! Once I have time, I will try to upload the source code!
Comprehensions are usually more pythonic than map()
Sorry about that. I've updated it. 
Programming in Python requires significant mindset changes when coming from Java. Why not read a Python book and not try to program in the language as you would do in Java? There is a pythonic way for doing a lot of things and you might want to get familiar with these ways if you want to write elegant Python code.
r/google, didn't u like the post though?
Looks like Flask and webapp2 had a kid. :)
I do see more limitations currently- 1. no pdf export (LaTeX embedding use case) 2. runs only in notebook 3. some plots that are trivial in MPL, Pandas; can be extremely complicated in Altair However, for the plot I mentioned, hands down Altair is easier. Thus, my earlier comment- still some time before one-size-fits-all! 
That SQL extension is awesome. Why didn't someone or Microsoft think of this in addition to VLOOKUP?
The issue is about changing what [`datetime.timedelta`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) look like on the console. In particular, changing them to: datetime.timedelta(days=3114, seconds=28747, microseconds=100000) from what is currently shown: datetime.timedelta(3114, 28747, 100000) It seems from the discussion on the issue that there are two kinds of developers: - One group which uses timedeltas so often that they will find it annoying if the `repr` was longer, which takes up more screen space. - The other group which occasionally uses timedelta but may forget what the arguments stood for and may need help for it. I personally belong to the second group of developers. I suspect that the distribution of programmers who use timedeltas binned by their frequency of usage will follow the [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle): only 20% of the developers will account for 80% of uses of timedelta, and the reamaining 80% of the developers will use it the remaining 20% of the time. Out of those 80%, some fraction will find the repr with the keywords more informative than the current version: I'm interested in finding what has the experience of other developers has been and what they think will benefit them more.
**Pareto principle** The Pareto principle (also known as the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few, or the principle of factor sparsity) states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. Management consultant Joseph M. Juran suggested the principle and named it after Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who noted the 80/20 connection while at the University of Lausanne in 1896, as published in his first paper, "Cours d'économie politique". Essentially, Pareto showed that approximately 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population; Pareto developed the principle by observing that about 20% of the peapods in his garden contained 80% of the peas. It is a common rule of thumb in business; e.g., "80% of your sales come from 20% of your clients." Mathematically, the 80/20 rule is roughly followed by a power law distribution (also known as a Pareto distribution) for a particular set of parameters, and many natural phenomena have been shown empirically to exhibit such a distribution. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.24
Flask. If you are just starting out. Also take a look at Sanic. An async web framework. Id put my money on Async Web frameworks. They are going to be the next big thing for python.
Using `join` directly on `numbers` loses the quotation marks around the number strings. You need to use `map(repr, number)` (or an equivalent list comprehension or generator expression) in order to get the desired output. Alas, that will cost you all of the performance improvement you measured and then some.
Most people are interested in Geopandas, I'm interested that there's no railways in Northern Ireland according to this,
documentation is the place for verbosity, not `repr`.
Made a simple maze generator, loosely following Daniel shiffman's processing tutorial for it I've only recently learnt about dicts in python and they made my code so much faster than lists, bringing a 200x200 maze from 90 -&gt; 5 seconds to generate There's a few other small changes for speed I could make but I am too lazy atm Here it is, if anyone's interested https://github.com/jchevertonwynne/pymazegen
I, respectfully, disagree. I, personally, don't mind having some extra verbosity on the console. Also consider that a developer made the following mistake: &gt; Well it [i.e. repr with keyword arguments] would have saved me an embarrassing moment -- I typed `datetime.timedelta(seconds=1e6)` at the command prompt and when the response came as `datetime.timedelta(11, 49600)` I mistook that as 11 years &gt; (I was in a hurry and trying hard not to have to think :-). I empathize with him. This may not happen to you, but it happened [to Guido](https://marc.info/?l=python-dev&amp;m=145066335824146&amp;w=2).
Good point, I missed the quote marks. numbers = ["14", "4", "7", "8", "5"] pretty_display = '({})'.fomat(', '.join(repr(n) for n in numbers)) Like you said, it is finally ~2 times slower than the tuple conversion, but I still would prefer to avoid using a data structrure only for display purpose :) 
I think CherryPy covers the use case of "Easy web framework that's production ready" pretty well. This might be a bit "lighter", but I'm not that big of a fan of ultralight software. Still this might be useful in certain cases.
When I first saw that Python had a for-else, I thought it was something that ran if the list was empty and otherwise didn't run. That seems like the most obvious way to interpret a for statement as a test. This seems really useful, but the name else makes it non-obvious what it's supposed to do.

Hi there, my client is looking for at least 2 years Python coding experience. You can send your profile to my work email....brian.doyle@stafffinders.co.uk
You've been offered plenty of good resources all ready so I'll add that for an experienced programmer I recommend *"Dive Into Python 3"*, the link is down and to the right under *"Online Books and Resources"*. Well worth reading are [Python Is Not Java](http://dirtsimple.org/2004/12/python-is-not-java.html) and [Java is not Python, either...](http://dirtsimple.org/2004/12/java-is-not-python-either.html).
I did! The media has screwed me up.

I couldn't care less about these ISS notification thingies that pop up every so often but I *definitely* would like to be notified if ISIS is above me.
No need, they already have the ultimate push notification: mortar fire.
a,b,c is evaluated as a tuple (a,b,c) - parens optional .
True. Map would be needed if we were transforming the already boolean value ; in this case any/all expect booleans hence map would be redundant
There's a typo in the filename of your requirements file, it's currently called 'requeriments.txt' while it should be 'requirements.txt'.
Have you done experimentation on the optimal it of that threshold value? Is 0.9 recommended, does it vary significantly? Cool simple approach otherwise. I could have used this in a hackathon last year.
Pygame isn't designed to be "batteries included" the way Qt is. It does graphics, audio, and keypress/controller input. For anything else, you're expected to use the Python standard library or another third-party library. I'd recommend the [appdirs](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/appdirs/1.4.3) library to find an appropriate place to save application state, then Python standard library to do the saving.
Check out /r/learnpython You could try [PyQt5](http://zetcode.com/gui/pyqt5/), or even simpler something like [Gooey](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey) if that would work for you.
Use [Maya's](https://github.com/kennethreitz/maya) timedelta. 
Thanks that's what I suspected. I have never used `appdirs`, that actually looks perfect! I guess I have been spoiled in PyQt just throwing any old thing in the registry like a damned fool. [Edit] Wow the online documentation for `appdirs` hurts it uses use `import *`. Why, devs, why? :) [Edit 2] It is actually being maintained at github so that's nice, though development has sort of stopped with Windows Vista: https://github.com/ActiveState/appdirs
Yep.
Thanks! I did not know about maya. I suspect that a lot more users end up having to, willingly or unwillingly, interacting with `stdlib`'s `datetime.timedelta` if for no other reason then just because it is _always_ there. Hence, improving it, IMHO, also makes sense. :-)
Shelve might work for you. It's a persistent database available in the standard libs. https://pymotw.com/3/shelve/index.html
I'd rather see QSettings on Windows store data in a file in an appropriate folder, the same way it does on other operating systems. But in a project that's using Qt, I'd still prefer QSettings over a homebrewed alternative or an unrelated library. Doing things in the obvious way in your code is more important than maintaining strict design-philosophy standards for other people's libraries.
suppose your wiki dump is in c:/documents go to the command line and change the directory to c:/documents then python -m gensim.scripts.make_wiki enwiki-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2 c:/documents/wiki_en (if you want the output in c:/documents)
You still have to choose the path where you'll save the backing database even if you're using `shelve` to access it, and I got the impression that choosing a file location was OP's primary concern.

Someone has forked it and is pushing it along at a much greater pace: https://github.com/Kriskras99/appdirs I hate to admit it, but I'm not actually very adept with git (I mostly use it for my own little projects). I guess this is a good excuse to get involved in a project and learn how to use it with other people.
Sounds like an awesome project! I would be interested to see what comes of it. Could you share your final product with me when you're done?
Just because it's dead simple doesn't mean it's bad, i imagine with more sophisticated techniques we could have better results, but the fact is that it may not even be needed. For example, that summarizing bot we see all the time on other posts does remarkably well despite using a dead simple algorithm. If simple works and does what we need, why add more moving parts?
I didn't write this post in order to convince you anything. I just wanted help if you could provide me with some,and not push me down for my "knowledge" :D
A simple discord bot,but not anything special.. And im not proud of it at all :( 
Great link thanks
Okay! Thank you for the reply and good information! 
And I wouldn't care. Prints should probably not be in your code anyways. Might as well not waste extra time writing them. Also, what happens when that list is 1 million entries long? I switch to numpy, so it prints a ... in the middle of the array.
Nifty stuff, wish it had more practical examples, but nifty. Worth noting that some elements (splat operator, for example) are only available in Python 3.x.
I just watched this from Pycon2017 https://youtu.be/jmsk1QZQEvQ, check that out from about 23:30 onwards.
Well, frankly I was hoping there would be a one size fits all solution where pygame just takes care of everything (I have been spoiled in pyqt). But since that's not the case, there are indeed two issues: where to save and how to save. I agree with undercoveryankee the bigger problem is where to store it: I'm fine doing basic file i/o I'll probably use json. Never had seen the `appdirs` package so I'll be testing that out tonight after work. 
Sounds like a regular expression would be helpful here. Probably one that searches for statements that match a SELECT followed by anything, followed by the end of a block or a semi-colon. 
Thanks for your suggestions. Other than a lot of experience with pyqt, I'm pretty new to all this frankly. I usually use matlab and julia. [Just noticed I posted above under a different login from a different computer at work. Well there goes that firewall. :) ]

It's hardly a canned solutution considering how new it is. For integrating common sensors, displays or anything that is cheaply available to the microcontroller enthusiast the existing library's and documentation for C makes it a much more pre packaged solution.

What is the AST module? I'm still a beginner in python, with no real specific path in trying to follow, so I'm kind of just bouncing around within the language lol
I've done the same thing. Ich wrote my own SQL formatter, it isn't really hard. Just get a list of the Keywords and write down rules to each keyword. For examble every "FROM" should be in Upper case and in a new line. That will do 90% of the work. It was a real fun project and ist now used daily by my coworkers
I didn't assume what you are using the resulting string for: printing, writing CSV files, logging, etc... Whatever your use is, I still think it is better to avoid using a data structure only for a display purpose.
It's quite similar to `scrapy shell`, though `scrapy shell` is just a embeded python shell with some functions and objects injected, where's parsel-cli I'm working on is a feature rich css/xpath interpreter. I've been working on it over the weekend and feel free to check out example bit of readme which shows of some of the features/shortcuts. What forced me to explore this was a task I had of validating and training machine learning powered crawler. At this point scrapy shell turned out to be very lacking and cumbersome: scrapy shell http://myurl.com ''.join([v.strip() for v in response.xpath("//somexpath").extract()])` # vs parsel-cli parsel-cli shell http://myurl.com -fjoin -fstrip //somexpath Also it's worth noting that parsel-cli and scrapy shell both use `parsel` as their backend for xml parsing, so with parsel-cli you'll get the same results just quicker and cleaner :)

Well, first you need to create the GUI, so you will have to pick a GUI widget toolkit. Several options here: Tkinter, PyQT, wxPython, PyGTK, Kivy, or others. You would then write the GUI code to put a window on the screen with widgets that allow the user to edit the variables. Using the "get" functions of these widgets, such as: users_edited_value = text_entry_box.GetValue() you would be able to collect all the edited values. The program would do the getting when some user action, like a button press, triggered it (you'd "bind" the button press to that action). You'd then pass all those new values to the script the user wants to run, and run it by calling the function that kicks off that program. That program could have default values that are used if the user *doesn't* supply edited values, or it would use the edited values if the user does supply them. Something roughly like that.

If you wanted to be thorough, you could use pyparsing to write a SQL parser that would parse *any* SQL and do anything you want with it. 
Maybe I read the OP's statement to literally (him wanting to print). If I want it to print/write differently the data differently, I have no problem recasting it. I frequently pass numpy arrays into classes and then use those classes print methods to write some nasty to write, but easy to read data format. I could use a function, but then I'd have 1000 functions like that with 30 arguments. Recasting data or processing it for output is comparatively cheap to the act of writing it out. Printing out 1 million entries when 100 would do or forcing the user to remove duplicate entries or sorting (depending on the use case obviously) is tedious.

If your downloads folder has a lot of things, you can make a script that sorts out the files into folders by extension. &amp;nbsp; I am working on a script that converts video files on my pc with ffmpeg. To make it easier to me i want to give it a folder and convert all the video files in the subfolders, check the new video file's integrity with ffprobe and if it is okay, put it back to the original file's place with the filename is renamed with an extra "H265_" in the beginning and delete the original file, or move it somewhere else. If you have a lot of video file you can do something like this. I have a lot of problems with spaces and special characters in the file's and folder's names so it is a bit of a challange for me, but i'm working on it. &amp;nbsp; Just find everyday stuff you want to automate.

Hi!, I'm the developer. The github project linked on the page is the base project to run the notifier locally with custom hooks, and the site's notification worker code &amp; logs are public [here](https://iss-worker.now.sh/_src). Heavens-above doesn't provide an API, and I've tried to do my best in order to scrape passes as less as possible (~10 requests per hour currently, 2 seconds between requests), I added credits, but really I do not have official approval from Heavens-Above's dev to do so. The site and worker are hosted on the OSS Zeit's Now plan, and it's using the free RedisLabs plan. So the project might die when resources reach their limits or by Heavens Above request. It would be great to use PyEphem! I just don't have the required knowledge to predict passes with TLE data and calculate somehow an approximate magnitude to filter visible passes, but I aim to perform local calculations in a future. I'll upload the site's code to github and open to suggestions. 
It's been tested on Linux and OS X. BSD isn't tested yet, but theoretically should work. Have you tried? Any issues?
Windows should actually work once the issue you've mentioned is fixed. It has limited profiler support, but memory profiler is there for Python 3.

Well it is a canned solution on the boards it comes installed on or can easily be installed on. As for libraries to communicate with add on devices; that is always an issue with new programming languages. Like all other systems it will be resolved with time. I just don't see a huge problem at the moment. I just don't see C as a polished solution for anything. It certainly isn't the language to go to for rapid development. In any event i don't see Micro Python as perfect. Rather as said i think it fills a rather big niche. I suspect others feel the same way as Micropython has been rather successful. 
My mistake, Unix-only.
You can chain .gets like so. artist_name = data.get('locale', {}).get('MetadataAlbum', {}).get('Artists', {}) \ .get('Artist', {}).get('ArtistsName', None) artist_role = data.get('locale', {}).get('MetadataAlbum', {}).get('Artists', {}) \ .get('Artist', {}).get('ArtistsRole', None) EDIT: You could also make a function that takes a chain of keys and returns the deepest value. def key_inspect(list_of_keys, dictionary_to_inspect): deepest_inspected_point = dictionary_to_inspect for key in list_of_keys: deepest_inspected_point = deepest_inspect_point.get(key, {}) return deepest_inspected_point EDIT 2: There are of course libraries that handle this too. :P 
you could use matplotlibs animate features to do this. create a list of the points for the path and then refresh the plot as you move through the list. This is also how you do basic live graphs with matplotlib. Not super fancy, but it should get the job done. If you're looking for something fancier, Id check out plotly, or pyqtgraph

Oh the ast module is pretty useless unless you want to make a debugger or an IDE, but it's sure neat. It let's you manipulate the code itself. You can print out the ast (which stands for abstract **syntax tree** which is how the python sees your code), and you can change it. For instance you could easily make a program to read another program and change all the return values to be whatever they would have been times 2. Or change all the function calls to pass in more args. Pointless but fun 
sqlparse is probably the right tool for the job here, but you'll have to potentially walk the parse tree produced by `sqlparse.parse()` and look for things that are `tokens.DML` and `value.upper() == 'SELECT'` or similar. https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/blob/master/examples/extract_table_names.py looks hackable into something potentially useable, depending on exactly what it is you're trying to extract, and what sort of queries you're going to be giving it as input.

You might want to check out /r/learnpython for questions like these. As soon as you encounter an element that occurs an even number of times you are returning None from your function. I'm not sure how you are getting two in your last test case.
Yes there are pluses and minuses for sure. I love python and obviously it has major advantages. In terms of what components it works with it needs work and hopefully i can add a few libraries to github this summer. But learning some C doing Arduino doesn't hurt anyone. I learned python for work but I enjoyed learning some C.
I was playing with this some time ago which is what made me think of PyEphem, what I was working on oddly enough was seeing if the ISS (Or any other object with TLE data) was visible from a certain position (which PyEphem can do with `Observer`) You create an `Observer` give it a latitude, longitude, and date (including epoch) then you compute against whatever object you are tracking (In this case `ephem.readtle(objname, tle_line1, tle_line2)`). This updates the object's altitude and azimuth (which are `obj.alt` and `obj.az`). But yeah you would get a lot of "visible" passes as just that alone can't account for cloud cover and objects in the way. Though it would probably be possible to look for a reliable weather service with an API to check for cloud coverage and also filter any passes with too low of an altitude (making the angle far too obtuse to see reliably)
You are going to have a really hard time getting help on this here since most people will refer you to /r/learnpython. Also I dont know if i would solve the problem the same way you are doing it. I would form a dict that takes the key as the list element and value as the number of times it is repeated then filter for odd values and check what key is the largest then return it..
Came here to say this 
It's usually not a good idea to use eval. Eval allows the user to execute arbitrary code. A better idea is to use a parser (parser generators make this easy) to parse the input into a syntax tree and interpret the output.
I didn't read Think Python. Since I already knew the basic concepts of programming I read Dive into Python 2 back in the days. It's called 'dive into' because it is a really quick overview of the language (more like a dictionary). I only read some chapters of Automate the boring stuff but if I remember correct it had way more text explaining stuff. They are both free so just take a look: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ http://www.diveintopython3.net/
Yep
The use of eval() is discouraged as it's potentially dangerous; it executes whatever expression it is given and returns whatever the expression returns; defaulting to None. [Note; for your calculator, I would suggest either regex or SymPy instead!] Another very similiar function would be exec(), which works a lot like eval() but always returns None and directly affects the program. Other less-known functions could be ord() and chr(); ord() takes a single character string as input and returns the equivalent UTF-8 index for said character - in other words, an integer value. chr() does the exact opposite, taking one integer value as input and returning the corresponding character. 
If you look at the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval) you can see that `eval` is in the group of built-in functions. You probably know quite a few of them already. One thing to note, though, is that passing user input into `eval` poses a security risk -- see [this simple example](http://ideone.com/vG9cDL) I just cooked up. As you can see, giving this program the input `open('/tmp/file.txt', 'w').write('Vandal')` instead of something like `5 * 5`, you are able to change the contents of the file that was supposed to contain `Canary`. 
What are you putting in your function params?
Python crash course. This book is awesome. Also I'm just a beginner but i hate learn python the hard way. 
Your function returns `None` as soon as you encounter an integer that occurs an even amount of times, you probably don't want that. Also, you should be able to solve this with only one sort. Also: /r/learnpython 
Shouldn't ask people to do your programming homework for you. :P
A lambda does exactly the same job as def, only with different syntax. If we write it using def does it make more sense? &gt;&gt;&gt; def make_incrementor(n): ... def func(x): ... return x + n ... return func ... &gt;&gt;&gt; f = make_incrementor(42) &gt;&gt;&gt; f(0) 42 &gt;&gt;&gt; f(1) 43 This construct is generally known as a closure: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)
Or just learn that argument order. Biggest to smallest, just like ISO date formats YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.
This version of the code doesn't clarify anything, because i get the idea behind an anonymous function. it doesn't make more sense, though, because when are we setting the value of x? We clearly set the value of n, but we never set x to anything. for example, i've seen anonymous functions being used as parameter values in both PHP and javascript, so anon funcs aren't new to me. if it's used as a parameter value, then i'm not left wondering where we set the anonymous function's parameter values, because they just get provided right away, at least the examples i've seen. In this case, we never set the value of x, and yet we end up using it. 
For work or personal?
Let's try moving this out of a function, and hopefully that will make it clearer. Your code is results in something like this: &gt;&gt;&gt; n = 42 &gt;&gt;&gt; f = lambda x: x + n &gt;&gt;&gt; f(0) 42 In this case `f` is an anonymous function that takes one argument `x` and adds that argument to a fixed values `n` (which is `42` in this case). So `x` is just the function argument, it is defined when the function is called. So it results in something like this: &gt;&gt;&gt; n = 42 &gt;&gt;&gt; def f(x): ... return x + n ... &gt;&gt;&gt; f(0) 42 So as you can see, either way you are creating a function that takes one value as an argument (`x`), and adds that to another fixed value (`n`). So `x` is not uninitialized, it is the argument to the function in variable `f`.
&gt; when are we setting the value of x When we call `f`. I mean, where are you *expecting* that `0` or `1` value to go?
I like the whole Idea of showing tech stack with 'real world' examples, instead of theoretical code bits. I'm definitely going to check some of them out.
&gt; it doesn't make more sense, though, because when are we setting the value of x? We clearly set the value of n, but we never set x to anything. Yes, you do. When you called make_incrementor(42), you set n to 42. The result of this call is another function (the lambda), with an argument x, which you assign to f. When you call f(0), you're setting x to 0.
that's what makes sense, but all that logic is encapsulated. Is that a product of lambda functions, objects, or something else?
so basically there's a hidden constructor that sets x when make_incrementor() is assigned a variable? what other kinds of scenarios is this hidden constructor called in?
... I don't understand what you're trying to ask. `make_incrementor` *returns* a function. Every time it is called, a *new* function is created. In the example code, we called it once and let `f` be a name for the result. The function that was created, that we named `f`, accepts one parameter, named `x`, because that's how it was defined by the `lambda`. So when we call `f(0)`, we are calling a function named `f` and passing `0` as the value for `x`, *just like if we had defined it any other way*. Closures also exist in javascript, and I wouldn't be surprised if PHP has them too.
I don't really understand why we arrived at a hidden constructor. When we call a function, the parameters are assigned the values supplied in the call. There is functionally no difference between the calls of make_incrementor(42) and f(0). Both just call a previously defined function.
Thanks for the reply. I tried to run the extraction script, but when I did so, nothing was returned. I converted the sql file to a string and passed that into the main func, but no dice. The top-level statements I am processing only contain INSERT, INTO, and VALUES according to the parser. However, the VALUES clause contains Select statements. Is there a way to recursively search for these?
We are dealing with 2 functions, therefore 2 calls. One for x and one for n. If you wanted to use x='foo' and n='bar', you could use this too: &gt;&gt;&gt; make_incrementor('bar')('foo') 'foobar' The only difference is that previously we had those calls on separate lines. 
Is there a reason that realworld.io redirects back to a github repo instead of a site explaining the whole project? Edit: Going through the code a bit I see some questionable decisions: * Is [favorite really something the article does](https://github.com/gothinkster/flask-realworld-example-app/blob/039910f94944b0b74c42f5c579dc954c1b2c44be/conduit/articles/models.py#L75) in the Django example it's modeled as an action that the *user* takes. * Why would [creating an object throw an IntegrityError](https://github.com/gothinkster/flask-realworld-example-app/blob/039910f94944b0b74c42f5c579dc954c1b2c44be/conduit/articles/views.py#L49)? * [Why not use super?](https://github.com/gothinkster/flask-realworld-example-app/blob/039910f94944b0b74c42f5c579dc954c1b2c44be/conduit/articles/models.py#L72) -- that's also the model in question that would throw the integrity error, doesn't look like there is anything there that would cause it. * [SQLAlchemy is not an active record styled ORM](https://github.com/gothinkster/flask-realworld-example-app/blob/039910f94944b0b74c42f5c579dc954c1b2c44be/conduit/database.py#L13) please don't make it try to act like one, you lose *so many benefits* and end up grossly coupling the models. * [You can actually use an arbitrary class as the declarative base in Flask-SQLAlchemy now](https://github.com/gothinkster/flask-realworld-example-app/blob/039910f94944b0b74c42f5c579dc954c1b2c44be/conduit/database.py#L41) For example: from flask_sqlalchemy import Model, SQLAlchemy class CRUDModel(Model): ... db = SQLAlchemy(model_class=CRUDModel) Though unless *all* your models are going to use this, I'd recommend against this. * [Why only one root exception?](https://github.com/gothinkster/flask-realworld-example-app/blob/039910f94944b0b74c42f5c579dc954c1b2c44be/conduit/exceptions.py) Even if that's all you've decided you need, why complicate things by not having factory methods on that class to raise those errors for you? All over I see patterns like this: from conduit.exceptions import InvalidUsage, USER_NOT_FOUND ... raise InvalidUsage(**USER_NOT_FOUND) Instead it could be made more elegant, and with less developer overhead by doing: class InvalidUsage(Exception): ... @classmethod def user_not_found(cls): return cls(**USER_NOT_FOUND) # someplace else raise InvalidUsage.user_not_found() Even better you could pass arguments into it to say *what* user wasn't found. * [UNKOWN\_ERROR](https://github.com/gothinkster/flask-realworld-example-app/blob/039910f94944b0b74c42f5c579dc954c1b2c44be/conduit/exceptions.py#L25) whoops. * [Why manually proxy these attributes?](https://github.com/gothinkster/flask-realworld-example-app/blob/039910f94944b0b74c42f5c579dc954c1b2c44be/conduit/profile/models.py#L49) and if they do need to be proxied, why not use an [association proxy](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/extensions/associationproxy.html) or [hybrid property](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/extensions/hybrid.html) to make them queryable?

Outside of implementation details -- ORMs, routing, etc -- there is business logic here that could be broken into a separate module and installed by both. Building an application to a framework -- as what has happened in both the Django and Flask ones (though I'm sure it's true in the other examples) -- rather than building a web component off of an application only leads to coupling and being wed to a framework. Looking through the Flask's example test suite, they all invoke a *running Flask application to test anything*. All the logic, the brains and smarts, are locked away and tightly married to persistence models and controllers/views, and ends up smeared all over the applications.

You seem sad :( ... Here's a picture/gif of a cat. Hopefully it'll cheer you up: http://random.cat/i/cat_did_u_forget.gif ^^The ^^internet ^^needs ^^more ^^cats. ^^It's ^^never ^^enough..
Isn't it strange what people find out and how? I knew this from the time that I started using Python 17 years ago. Am I weird because I actually bother to read docs rather than make assumptions which are often wrong?
I did that and this doesn't change anything. Registering package to https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ Registering my-package-name-0.1.tar.gz HTTPError: 410 Client Error: This API is no longer supported, instead simply upload the file. for url: https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ And the manual upload link given doesn't work. Seems like I'm trying at the worst moment (transition phase) EDIT: contacted them about the issue, thanks a lot for pointing out the email from the maintainer 
That would have been very convenient and the `repr` for `datetime.date` and `datetime.datetime` do just show the numbers in the ISO8601 order. However, what do you expect the `11` in datetime.timedelta(11, 49600, 100) to be? If you thought _years_, then your guess would coincide with [Guido von Rossum's guess](https://marc.info/?l=python-dev&amp;m=145066335824146&amp;w=2) and you both would be **wrong**. It is _days_. The second argument is _seconds_. And the third argument is not _milliseconds_, but _microseconds_. Hence, remembering that they are from biggest to smallest, though useful, does not _really_ help much.
No, () doesn't mean a tuple, commas mean tuple:- &gt;&gt;&gt; a = 1, 2, 3 &gt;&gt;&gt; a;type(a) (1, 2, 3) &lt;class 'tuple'&gt;
I meant in the `repr`, not the creation, since OP is concerned with how they print. If it prints with square brackets it's a list; if it prints with parenthesis it's a tuple. 
Work. 
when you fail to understand something super basic, a bit of humility is never a bad idea.
killing the old method will be a big improvement over that transition :)
Print uses __str__ not __repr__
Np! Someday you might find that pretty cool. I've been thinking of making a code visualization thing for a long time which is why I used that module 
!showyeahs 
So, did you *really* post to solicit opinions or to stump for your own argument? In the short time you've spent here, you have become an expert on the topic. So why demand additional documentation in every `repr`? My opinion is that `repr` output should not be verbose, but if practical, should be parse-able by `eval`.
Oh nice!
Indeed. &gt;&gt;&gt; class breamoreboy: ... def __repr__(self): ... return "I was wrong" ... &gt;&gt;&gt; print(breamoreboy()) I was wrong More to the point is not what method was used, but what was returned. A 'repr' is a python-readable **repr**esentation of the data. Since the output of `print(some_list)` is readable to python, it's a 'repr'. 
The use of `eval` aside, Python has a relatively small set of core functions. You can read about all of them in the official documentation: [Built-in Functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#built-in-functions)
The link is down. Is there something else? 
Because there is also MS Access in Office products. From MS Access there is migration path to SQL Server.
No.
I don't have it running right now sorry! It was just a small project and I doubt I'll keep the bot around
So you will no doubt be raising a bug report to correct the [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#basic-customization)? object.__repr__(self) Called by the repr() built-in function to compute the “official” string representation of an object. If at all possible, this should look like a valid Python expression that could be used to recreate an object with the same value (given an appropriate environment). If this is not possible, a string of the form &lt;...some useful description...&gt; should be returned. The return value must be a string object. If a class defines __repr__() but not __str__(), then __repr__() is also used when an “informal” string representation of instances of that class is required. This is typically used for debugging, so it is important that the representation is information-rich and unambiguous. object.__str__(self) Called by str(object) and the built-in functions format() and print() to compute the “informal” or nicely printable string representation of an object. The return value must be a string object. This method differs from object.__repr__() in that there is no expectation that __str__() return a valid Python expression: a more convenient or concise representation can be used. The default implementation defined by the built-in type object calls object.__repr__(). 
? You just proved my point for me?

Some options that are fun and potentially useful: * Build a Flask-based website * Make a Raspberry Pi based IoT sensor or desktop kiosk * Make a bus-arriving-soon notification service if you ride the bus and they have a public API * Make a product-in-stock notifier that sends you an SMS when some product is restocked 
I tried it, but I can't for the life of me, figure it out. It works fine on the browser, so I know that somehow the browser is getting the images and breaking it out by the '--frame' boundary. But how do I do that via requests.get(url, stream=True) and then using r.iter_content(). If I set the chunk size to None, it never returns, memory just keeps going up and up (I assume that it's because it's trying to cache the endless stream).
OO I like your approach. I must be doing something wrong because I am still getting an empty result. Thank you!
Language returns "en" or "fr" and data is the json I added on my question
There's some pre-trained neural networks that can probably do almost exactly what you need already. Tensorflow comes with python source to re-train inception pretty quickly for specific object recognition tasks.
umm, what? edit: i'm focused on solving a problem. I feel no need to grovel to some anon on the internet. Plus, as far as i'm concerned everyone who answered the question is without doubt a better developer than me, so frankly I see no reason for you to assume that i'm not humble about what I don't know. When you fail to understand someone adequately, a bit of restraint is never a bad idea.
&gt; make_incrementor returns a function. Every time it is called, a new function is created. ok now that makes sense. I've only seen closures used as the parameter to a function, and their behavior was much more self-evident when used that way. I never had to think of them in this way based on how i'd seem them used in the past. That helps a lot, thanks.
Hey I watch this on safaribooksonline, it's great!
This kind of construct is called a "higher order function". Higher order functions also incorporate those functions that use functions as a parameters. It can be really useful for certain things. You could, for instance, do something like this: def deriv(f): h = 0.001 def new_func(x): return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h return new_func or, more concisely: def deriv(f): h=0.001 return lambda x: (f(x+h) - f(x)) / h This takes a function of one variable as a parameter, and returns a function that gives an estimate of the paramater's derivative at a point. --- Basically, higher order functions allow you to do some interesting manipulations on functions themselves. A notable use in Python is decorators.
You mean, safaribooksonline is great, or the course?
Both bro
I'm glad you like it! If you could leave a brief review that would be great, but I'm flattered! Thanks!

Thank you so much for taking the time to write this reply, I don't think I can answer your questions because you are actually right. I proxy the attributes in the model so that they can be used by the [serializer](https://github.com/gothinkster/flask-realworld-example-app/blob/039910f94944b0b74c42f5c579dc954c1b2c44be/conduit/profile/serializers.py) I didn't know about association proxy and hybrid property, I will look into improving the code base, as for why realworld.io leads to the github repo, I'm really not sure you have to ask the creators, and thanks again for your remarks.
That's what parsel is, it uses `lxml` as a backend. Lxml by itself is a bit of a PITA to work with and wrapper like `parsel` makes it usable by humans :)
Yet another way of looking at this would involve **functools.partial** and a more explicit implementation: from functools import partial def incrementor(c, x): return c + x def make_incrementor(n): return partial(incrementor, n) f = make_incrementor(42) In all cases **f** is ultimately a function that has been defined to take an argument *x* and add it to a *constant* that was defined as 42 when **make_incrementor** was called.
bruh
What is Python 'golden standard' when it comes to encryption, password protection etc.? To what libraries should we compare Privy? Who is it competing against?
God I hate useless lists like this. So JavaScript's *unknown metric* has grown by 97% in 2016, has it? Wow!
No, there's no hope for old pypi, first backend and then the warehouse. There's neither turning back nor brakes in this hype train. 
So, I looked at the code you linked to. Couple of things: * Jython still doesn't support Python 3. So don't expect Python 3 support in Processing.py anytime soon. * You won't be able to use `numpy`, `skimage`, etc. Since Processing.py is based on Jython support for libraries (other than the ones included in the standard library and some pure-python ones) is extremely limited. See the first point on the wiki (https://github.com/jdf/processing.py/wiki). Essentially, "downgrading the code to Python 2" still won't work because you don't get the libraries you need. Edit: Also see http://py.processing.org/tutorials/python-jython-java/ 
Don't do it if you are worried about the security of the process, its trivial to steal the secret and the password from a running program that uses this library; even the usual efforts of memory wiping appear to not even been bothered with. Things like the expiration parameter of privy.peek are giving a false sense of security that somehow the secret is now "gone". Python is bad at keeping memory safe, there's not a clear universal way to wipe memory that works every time, there is some hacky ways with importing C modules but the garbage collector can still mess things up. Generally using the OS keyring via the keyring package is a usual suggestion to handle what privy is doing. See Python Cryptography's warnings about this: https://cryptography.io/en/latest/limitations/ 
Worthless
I think for this use case a specific, custom LogFormatter might just be the best option. How would the log output you have in mind look like?
Use the proper tool for your task. Learn the more versatile first, then the specialized ones.
&gt; See Python Cryptography's warnings about this: https://cryptography.io/en/latest/limitations/ Great, thanks, will give it a read. Maybe add this to sidebar? This seems like a popular topic, no?
&gt; So, did you really post to solicit opinions or to stump for your own argument? For both. :) I am rather invested in issue since I've spent sometime reading through the mail archives, looking at the code, and making a [Pull Request](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/1493). &gt; In the short time you've spent here, you have become an expert on the topic. So why demand additional documentation in every repr? It probable that I will not make a mistake in reading `datetime.timedelta` output since I've spent some time on that issue (see above). I may forget it and have to look it up again eventually, though. However, I'd rather that not everyone who uses `datetime.timedelta` be forced to spend this time. Adding keyword arguments to the `repr` solves the problem once and for all. &gt; My opinion is that repr output [...] should be parse-able by eval. Several people agree with you there. However, not many `repr` (including the current case) can be `eval`-ed directly (say, if you `import datetime as D` instead of `import datetime`) and adding the keyword arguments will not change that. ---- **Update:** &gt; just like ISO date formats YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS. Just to reiterate, the ~~order~~ **units** in `datetime.timedelta` does not follow any ~~natural order~~ **intuitive criteria** and it is unclear (as discussed on the issue and the mailing list) whether there is such a natural and mutually agreed upon ~~order~~ **unit**.
&gt; the order in datetime.timedelta does not follow any natural order Please be careful to understand the difference between *order* and *selection*. As I said, it is in the same order (largest to smallest) as ISO date format. However, it does skip some elements, and I understand that is the core confusion for you. For that, consider these two rationale: * Days are useful for accountants. Seconds are useful for people watching the screen. Microseconds are useful for performance analysis. * These units were more likely chosen because their integer components would not overflow on 32bit (unless you're working with the early half of the Cenozoic era, or older). 
Hi /u/steelypip Few weeks ago, I have made a little library called [Scapl](https://github.com/ducdetronquito/scalpl) that could be helpful for your use case. It allows you use the standard dict API (get, set, update, setdefault, etc...) with dot separated keys in order to go through your nested dictionary. It could look like this: from scalpl import Cut proxy = Cut(data) proxy.get('locale.MetadataAlbum.locale.language') You can download it with pip (it is a Python3 package by the way): pip3 install scalpl Hope it will help you :)
I think wagtail might be your choice here since it is more flexible and more popular in developer community like Github, you can check the third party plugins for both framework and their source code then you can see which framework is easy to extend. There is a [blog post](https://blog.michaelyin.info/2017/06/19/python-cms-framework-review-wagtail-vs-django-cms/) talking about the pros and cons between Django-cms and wagtail, you can also check it for more detail. 
&gt; difference between order and selection. You are correct, I should have said natural *units*. I'll update the comment. re: the rationale chosen for the actual representation: &gt; Representation: (days, seconds, microseconds). Why? Because I &gt; felt like it. from the [docstring in `datetime.py`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/48350412b70c76fa51f488cfc736c80d59b5e8eb/Lib/datetime.py#L350). :-) Guido [has said that he](https://marc.info/?l=python-dev&amp;m=145066335824146&amp;w=2): &gt; I [Guido] might still go for it [i.e. changing the representation], if it wasn't too late by over a decade (as Tim says). Nevertheless, modulo the rationale, I still think telling the user that these are the units rather than just showing the numbers would be better. 
You need to explain your metric properly. Otherwise this is just a gut feeling list.
If you are trying to create a *hardened* program that primarily handles secrets then you just shouldn't use Python for it, some of the ease of use that Python provides has trade offs and memory management is one of them. Security wise it isn't a terrible limitation, the lack of a buffer overflows popping up is a good trade off for insecure memory management(possible remote code execution vs local secret stealing) for most people. This [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15455048/releasing-memory-in-python) post goes more into the oddities of Python's malloc usage and some behavior that can look like a memory leak that most are probably unaware of. I'm assuming the memory from privy.hide is still accessible due for the same reason why the OP was seeing the memory increase after the loop was finished. 
Professionally I don't touch subjects I know nothing about, my question was more because I am a Python aficionado and always would like to know more. And more. Never stop learning! ...but leaving some subjects to people that know what they are doing is par for the course, I think.
Werkzeug is awesome to build on. I built our new framework on it and it handles everything we could ask for, and it's very very fast.
This is really cool. But how do I add a Subject to the email? 
How is the connectivity to the API? Can you connect to it with your browser as described here https://developers.meethue.com/documentation/getting-started ?
yes! The bridge respons fine in the network on the IP
Wow, thank you for sharing that! I had tried to do exactly that in the past but did not manage to achieve what you have.
gee i dunno maybe when you tell people their explanations are useless they'll stop trying to hammer something into your thick skull and just give you abuse instead?
Good work! I tried your module but when I type "app = appstat('com.whatsapp')" I get a TypeError. Is there a fix?
https://github.com/quentinsf/qhue/issues/17#issuecomment-312847455
You're welcome! I wrote this some month ago, and feel like someone can find it useful. I have been amazed that with few lines, we achieve such tasks. I did not comment it at all... but the variables are explicit enough (I hope). The only tricky stuff is that I set White and Black colors outside of the cmap range, because usually these are used for axes or background. It will work best if there is only the image without legend or other but... Eh, good enough? As side-effect, it will convert the colorbar as well.
I started with python, switched to java, and now I use both. You can mix up parts, but I found it quite easy.
which one do you think is more explicit? 
Hey thanks for trying it. :) In place of "appstat('com.whatsapp')" it has to be "AppStat('com.whatsapp')" . Import like this "from playstats.appstat import AppStat" then use "AppStat" directly this would make things easier.
It has to be lowercase. appstat not AppStat. Uppercase won't work for me.
Okay so playstats is the name of the package appstat.py is a python file in it and AppStat is a class in appstat.py. So to use it you have to create an object of the class AppStat. Also you can see on Github,I have described how to use it.
I think your choices make sense and in my case, it totally solves my problem (lucky me). Great job!
I don't know what your fucking problem is, but you need to take a ritalin or some shit. Like, seriously take a chill pill. 
Please don't spread FUD. Many secure systems are written in Python. 1. It's not really possible to prevent memory from hitting swap in Python. The best security advice (for any language) is to not keep sensitive data in memory for long. OpenSSL doesn't even mlock. 2. OpenSSL 'attempts' to zero out memory but the Python layer won't receive that benefit. If one's threat model involves memory dumps, all software implementations are unsafe. Dedicated hardware is needed at that point.
Interesting I never has issues. Do you have a more practical example. Would like to see a version using parcel verse lxlm native

For simple scraping, you can use a requests to download the page and beautifulsoup4 to parse it. Both support Python 3. Scrapy is a robust scraping framework which you could use for more heavy duty scraping. It has support for Python 3.3+ as well. The tools you should use depends on the task at hand. What exactly are you trying to scrape?
Been thinking about making an online text based game, not sure when I'll start, though.
Thanks for the info! I'm trying to gather a TON of stock market data. Specifically, 10-year price histories for all publicly traded US companies, then 10-Q data for all publicly traded companies... basically stuff on that scale - data for **all** publicly traded US companies.
Why are you scraping it? Why not search for a service that offers an API to that data.
What the point for them to make a new language for which there is no resources and that nobody knows instead of using python or a more suited mainstream language if necessary ?
My own, i have already changed that..? Anyways, i don't want to use CGI anymore. I need to use WSGI for Python.
I've seen this suggested before. But I don't know if I want to learn a new language for just one engine. How similar is it to python?
I have - they're very, **very** expensive. EDIT: Furthermore, they're limited to about 500 API calls/day. I'd have to wait months to get all the data I need.
Okay, if you can get this info by parsing the html, then the libraries that I mentioned are enough. If you need screen scraping, then you could use the Python bindings to Selenium (Python 3.5+), but the setup is more complicated.
Seems ok to me. Are you still having problems viewing it?
Thanks for the response. Dang...I see. Is there any other way around this? I'm using some code in processing and was really hoping to integrate this with it

I've made a webscraper that combs a TV show's imbd page for character appearances. It takes all the appearances and creates a network graph that shows how many times a character has featured and which other characters they have starred in the same episodes as. I'm using Gephi to try and make some interesting visualisations of the data. Difficult for a show like sopranos that has over 1100 unique characters. Just end up with so much colourful spaghetti. 
So glad to hear that. Please let me know if any part of it trips you up and you need more clarity. If something trips you up, it will probably trip up someone else as well. - Brian

Couple of things I can think of: 1. Port your Processing code to Python. 2. Reimplement the `numpy` and `skimage` functions you are using in pure Python. This kinda defeats the purpose of using the libraries, but if you aren't doing something super complex, this could work. 3. Try and look for Java alternatives to `skimage` and `numpy`. If you find a good enough Java library you can use that from Processing. 4. Do the whole thing in two steps. The code you linked to is about segmenting an image, if you are creating the image using Processing, you can first save it and then run a Python script to segmentize it.
Too much tech debt.
Too much tech debt.
It would be helpful if it indicated which version of Python. 
Caught advertising yourself. ;)
Never mind. I see the option. Would it be possible if these selections were bigger? It is hard to read with old eyes. 
In what way? 
P.S: Great work. I appreciate it.
You mean in the results page? If you are looking for a certain version, you can use the filter on the left hand side. The book detail page also indicates which version of Python the book uses. If it says both Python 2 and Python 3, this means that the book discusses both.
Thanks. Sorry that it was difficult for you to read. I will try to fix that.
I think you should take a look at the games people have made here: http://pyweek.org. All of the game source code is available so if you find a game that kinda looks similar to what you're thinking of, you can just see what library they are using. Minor thing about pyglet: The pyglet mailing list has been quite active lately. The whole documentation is being reworked and they are planning on upgrading the internals and adding 3D models and what not. I've personally find the Pyglet syntax less cumbersome than PyGame's and it's quite easy to pick up if you read through the official documentation. Have you looked at arcade (http://arcade.rtfd.io)? It's a pyglet based library for creating 2D games.
Angular's long term release is only viable for 6 months, which is a joke to begin with. Second, the next release is a "breakable release" meaning you will need to do major refactoring to finished code. Third, angular is a fad, and there are much better alternatives to be used in its place. Ember and React both provide a better, more stable, platform. And heaven forbid you originally wrote your legacy code in AngularJS, you have an even larger issue porting to typescript and the current Angular release. Thus, MASSIVE tech debt.
That's awesome - I somehow missed that one last time I looked over Quandl... Thanks!
Nice work , you can add further entries for different techs Python is used in like Machine Learning , Data Science etc.
I'm Python developer, don't know much about Ruby, but few things may help you: 1. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4769004/learning-python-from-ruby-differences-and-similarities &gt; I'm not going to lie, I pretty much love Ruby. I used to program in Java and C#, and while it took me a long time to do the switch into duck-typing, I can't look back now. It is worrying for me that you are considering switching to another language that you know nothing about, which I am indicating from mentioning duck-typing. Python relies on that too. &gt; First of all, if we will indeed do the switch to Python, how long does it take the normal developer to do the switch and write decent quality code No such thing like "normal developer" exist. Take it as you wish, but I'd say learning comes to some people harder than others, and asking people for advice without doing any research on its own indicates it comes hard for you. You can get some Ruby-to-Python (or Rails-to-Django) cheatsheet in a google search and learn differences and similarities in 5 min (embracing them will take longer of course). &gt; is Python more conservative like Java Comparing to Java - no, it is nowhere near it. Comparing to Ruby though, Python expects you to control things instead of writing bits that are controlled by something. This means less magic, more control and more verbosity. It takes more effort and code to write, but pays of when reading. For every bit of Python code it is very clear where it came from and what it does. It is an advantage for me, you may see it differently. &gt; is TDD a common thing Lot of people are doing it, and there is plenty of tools to support that. It may be something you'll need to reach for though, Python won't throw this in your face on its own. &gt; is vim popular among Python programmers Yes. There are all kinds of IDEs, but vim has all the support and tooling you can think of.
It's only Techdebt if you actually promote to the next release, the core functionality of angular 1.x is strong enough that you only need to upgrade if you want the new shiny framework but rarely is it a necessity unless the dev butchered the codebase which is pretty easy to do in javascript land. Plus you can use React with angular's routing. Google has also stated that the conversion from an MVC driven framework to a Component based one is the biggest change they will make thus going from ng-4 to 5 should be a lot smoother. Regardless I am just building up a series on stuff I know and mainly looking into deep diving AWS and Flask more as it's semi related to my next work project. I am also working on learning React and will have one on that after I finish the AWS posts. 
http://IMDb.com/interfaces to make that scraping easier. Incidentally, one of my ongoing projects is to parse and merge those files with Apache Spark and other frameworks to learn about them. Edit: Oh, damn. I just saw that they scrapped the old dumps in favor of a few castrated versions on S3 starting July 1. Well, fuck that shit. You can get the last full dump (June 30) from here: ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/misc/movies/database/
Thanks. There are sections for specializations e.g. here's the one for [Machine Learning](http://pythonbooks.org/topical-books/machine-learning-and-artifical-intelligence/) and [Numerical programming and data science](http://pythonbooks.org/topical-books/numeric-and-big-data/). If you mean that I should add more books to these section, absolutely! I will be updating the site with more books regularly from now on. I will be adding new books (you can subscribe for updates in the footer) and existing books that are not listed on the site yet.
I checked your site again, it's really wonderful to see all the stats of the book. I will be regularly visiting your site.
Thanks!
There are a number of reasons everyone should upgrade away from 1.x, one.being that 1.x is not es6 compliant, so you end up writing code that is much more convoluted than it should be. Not to mention you have to hack on it to accomplish what you want it to do. For example, you want to implement the usage of a Set? Good luck in 1.x instead you get to write the set logic yourself, and it is almost guaranteed to be horrible by performance standards. Not to say the developer is bad, you just don't have access to pointer logic. That aside, I commend you for your work with flask and AWS, it is some really cool technology, and you have a pretty good implementation.
Great, it's really easy to get the position respect to the observer with PyEphem. I'm looking for a way to calculate the apparent magnitude based on the sun-iss-observer angle. That's a valuable information to avoid overwhelming subscribers. I read that by setting pressure to 0 disabling atmospheric reflection calculations, and setting horizon to 10 degrees helps on filtering. Not so much information on the internet :/
And I apologize, this thread is about the python topics, I shouldn't pounce on you for the other tools as they are irrelevant to this subreddit; nor should I hijack your topic to rant. Good job.
Thanks for the es6 callouts, I agree you are very correct there. I'll consider looking into the latest react sooner then later and have a bigger section on that as the tutorial develops! Also thank you for taking the time to explain the tech debt comments in a 'disagree and commit' way and not just being trolley ;) I always appreciate alternative tech viewpoints when they are justified
Thanks for the quick answer fiedzia :) &gt; which I am indicating from mentioning duck-typing. Python relies on that too. That's actually the only think I DO know about Python :-) It's bad choice of words on my side. I just mentioned this as It took me a while to do the switch from Strongly-typed languages into duck-typing to emphasize change like that is difficult. I'm trying to figure out if there is another 'big leap' between Python and Ruby that fundamentally changes the way you interact with the programming language (AKA - are all interrupt language follows the same basic philosophy?)

Its parser was "fine" 10 years ago when there was no standard and everybody did their own thing and nothing worked (same for lxml's builtin HTML parser) but that's not where we're at anymore, now we have a well-specified algorithm for parsing HTML and [all browsers more recent than IE9 fully support HTML5 tokenising and tree building](https://html5test.com/compare/feature/parsing.tokenizer/parsing.tree.html). So use [html5lib](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/html5lib), it will parse pages the exact same way browsers do which means you can use your browser's Inspect pane as a reference when looking for stuff, which you *can not* do with the native BS parser. And then I'd recommend manipulating the tree use LXML instead of BS, it: * is faster * uses less memory * has wider applicability * supports most CSS3 selects so you can "copy selector path" form your browser's developer tools * supports XPath so you can "copy xpath" from your browser's developer tools or in case you're familiar with that from having worked with XML
Both languages are dynamic, interpreted, with similar (if not identical) type system. There are some minor differences in how you solve some problems, but a cheatsheet will solve that quickly. Probably the "You control -vs-you are being controlled" is the biggest difference. A consequence of that is that there is less DSL in Python, conventional language features are used instead. But really, go through some Python tutorial and you'll see all that immediately.
You comment is interesting. I have been doing heavy duty scraping for a while now with BS + lxml and I never faced a problem so far. But I haven't used html5lib so far, so I don't know much about it. Can you give an example where BS doesn't work?
Yes, I was checking the django repository couple of hours ago, and that's indeed the same feeling I got. The code does not translate to a story like Ruby's code tend to be, but indeed much more explicit. I will probably take a Code-School tutorial about Python and write an REST API wrapper just to feel things, but nevertheless you pin-pointed me on the things I should look at. Thanks.
If you are new to python you are not likely to see much differences between Python and GDScript. GDScript is really close to python in both the syntax and the built in data structures (dictionaries, lists). I am a huge python user but for video games (both 2D and 3D) I go with Godot and it's fun :) ! There is a nice little community on /r/godot if you need help ! Ps: Godot is actively developed by its community, and there are people working on bindings to other languages. There is a good and short conference about this for the python binding :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7Sq1TdLgKQ 
I’m curious as to your thoughts about using `bs4` with `html5lib` as a parser. I’ve used `bs4` a bunch and am comfortable with its document model and traversing/querying page elements. What is the advantage of XPath? E.g.: In [0]: %paste import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup url = 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/6l78oe/are_all_python_web_scraping_tools_outdated/' response = requests.get(url) page = BeautifulSoup(response.content.decode(response.encoding), 'html5lib') authors = [a.text for a in page.find_all('a', attrs={'class': 'author'})] print(*authors, sep='\n') ## -- End pasted text -- BioGeek nevare chromakode mdipierro kingkilr quasarj jrupac ivosaurus aphoenix AutoModerator YelluhJelluh rroocckk masklinn rroocckk YelluhJelluh PurdueME06 YelluhJelluh igerner YelluhJelluh rroocckk alexat711 
Python and Ruby are both strongly typed languages. Where they differ from Java and C# is that they’re both dynamically typed. JavaScript and PHP are examples of weakly typed languages; they allow things like `1 +’1’`. 
Same here re: BS4. Scraped far too much content with BS + libxml and never had an issue. Wonderfully ergonomic. Maybe h5lib is better, but I've never needed to find out. I doubt its as good, but i'm sure it parses better. Seems academic. I do a lot more than use CSS selectors, so... usually its finding, sorting, combining nested text, and so on. BS has been perfect so far.
[Seems like someone else had this issue before and solved it](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19759501/calculating-the-phase-angle-between-the-sun-iss-and-an-observer-on-the-earth).
Picking Python up as a hobby. This helps. 
You can find the reasons in Godot documentation :) http://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/learning/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html But like I said in an other comment, there are some works on other language bindings coming with Godot 3.0 A conference on the Python binding: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7Sq1TdLgKQ
Things like properties and attributes were a bit confusing for me coming from Java. Where, you just create getter and setter methods. 
sweet, I will give it a try!
Happy that it is useful to you.

Mean variance optimization algorithm in Python. After literally years of trying to understand the scipy optimize function, I finally figured it out and I used it to implement a risk parity asset allocation, now I am moving on to MVO. Not as fancy as other projects here; I am a finance guy. But I am also at some point setting a live camera feed with RasPi for my bird and making a FitBit for him. I did this last year but the program failed, actually the cron task failed, not the program itself, as I want it to start at 7 am to 7 pm. I implemented colour tracking with the camera before and since he is predominantly green, the tracker is pretty accurate. Basically the tracker records the coordinate of the bird and I used this coordinate to calculate his speed and his movement and his favourite toys/perch (hot spot where the coordinate clusters). Not exactly accurate because RasPi is not that powerful. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/62jmec/i_am_getting_a_very_bizarre_result_when_scraping/ breaks the exact same way using html.parser and lxml for parsing.
&gt; Seems academic. It's the exact opposite of academic. A compliant parser lets you use your browser's developer tools to look at the page's DOM and reliably know how to get there programmatically, a non-compliant parser will eventually break and yield a different parse tree than your browser's.
Thanks for that reference. So lxml's parser fucks up when the page has html formatting errors. I would have to keep that in mind in the future. 
I'm not. 4 weeks of paid vacation for everybody here in Finland :&gt;
How do I port my code to python? I've never actually used python in my life, so once my code is ported to it, I can still make visuals and stuff? Its actually the opposite, I need to segment an image and then the segments need to be loaded into processing and applied to another image. I dont quite follow #2 and #3, if I get these libraries, where would I be putting them exactly? I can show you the code too if it makes it easier. *I also found https://www.nodebox.net/code/index.php/About Not sure if this could help. Thanks for the help 
Bookmarked and shared
I thought there might have been an easier way alright. It's helped me get a bit better at BeautifulSoup and organising the scraped data so I'm not too annoyed about an inefficient approach. 
Thanks! The bookmark icon (favicon) was kindly designed by /u/TrakJohn at /r/learnpython .
If you can use lxml that is faster and less demanding than bs4. Other than that you have been given good advice by others 😊
Never heard before about 'weakly typed'. Thank you :)
Scrapy is pretty awesome, I've used it a bunch in production. https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy
Thanks. I'll check it out.
I just released a new version of my library (yay!). [aiospamc](https://github.com/mjcaley/aiospamc) I switched out separate regular expressions I used for parsing packets and replaced it with a parser combinator. I had to tweak it a bunch so it didn't perform like crap, now it's not too bad.
Isn't that for mobile games? How well suited is it for making games for PC?
Been trying to figure out the reason why my Chi square statistic is a factor 5 too high. Have made a 1D Gaussian and a 2D Moffat fit routine for finding and analysing Planetary Nebulae emissions in [OIII] spectra. Still no closer to figuring out why, either my fits are bad or i have a sneaky factor of 5-6 hidden somewhere.....
I work as an HR person for a small dev company, which got me interested in development. I am **not** a developer. Every month I download a pdf file made by the company that calculates the wages with everyone's payslip. I need to separate each single pdf page, rename it with the developer's 3 letter acronym, the year and month to which the payslip refers, and the word "payslip" in one of the two local languages based on the developer's preference. I wrote my very first practical python [script](https://github.com/ArthurBlakey/pdfSplitPayslip/blob/master/pdfSplitter.py) that automates this and would like some review. My colleagues don't write in python, and I'd prefer to get some tips from strangers on the internet first. Thank you very much!
&gt; I’ve used bs4 a bunch and am comfortable with its document model and traversing/querying page elements. If you're already comfortable with it knock yourself out, but I don't think people who aren't already familiar with bs should be told to use it. &gt; What is the advantage of XPath? Powerful traversal and filtering, though it does have some drawbacks with respect to CSS selectors for some HTML specifics (mostly matching on classes, builtin XPath doesn't really have a concept of space-separated attributes lists, in that case you'd want to use CSS, or have the relevant xpath function secreted in a small module, or use exslt which lxml bundles). &gt; E.g.: tree = html5lib.parse(response.content, treebuilder='lxml', namespaceHTMLElements=False).getroot() # CSS authors = [a.text for a in tree.cssselect('a.author')] # simple but not quite correct authors = tree.xpath('//a[contains(@class, "author")]/text()') # actually correct authors = tree.xpath(r"//a[re:test(@class, '\bauthor\b', '')]/text()", namespaces={'re':"http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})

I am still working on my /r/HFY bot that can send new posts from authors you subscribed to to Pocket. The bot is working fine and I wrote a simple webapp to authenticate with your Pocket account and to subscribe and unsubscribe to authors. I built it with Flask, but I don't feel the code is very clean. Now I am thinking about redoing it with Django. And maybe find a place to host it so other people can use it.
I don’t mean to be argumentative, and I don’t know much about the edge-cases, but I think `bs4` is just overall simpler. I’m sure there are pitfalls with `bs4` as well, but if the pitfalls are not with the parser (since you can use `html5lib` with `bs4`), it sounds like you’re saying that people should learn a more difficult querying language that has gotchas even in a very simple case like this?
&gt; I don’t mean to be argumentative, and I don’t know much about the edge-cases, but I think bs4 is just overall simpler. How is authors = [a.text for a in page.find_all('a', attrs={'class': 'author'})] simpler than authors = [a.text for a in tree.cssselect('a.author')] the latter being what you already know from doing any web development? &gt; it sounds like you’re saying that people should learn a more difficult querying language that has gotchas even in a very simple case like this? People can use CSS queries, they're perfectly well supported by lxml. And XPath is not difficult. It does lack class-related HTML-specific amenities though, something I believe I was pretty upfront and honest about.
&gt; the latter being what you already know from doing any web development? Some people don’t do web development.
Right, people doing web scraping while not knowing anything about the web and not expecting to ever learn about it. I think we're done here, have a nice day.
Languages are described by two different types of types: static vs dynamic and strong vs weak. A lot of people seem to confuse dynamic for weak. Here's a fun exercise. Try the following code in JavaScript, Ruby, and Python. What do you think expect the result to be? 'foo' + + 'foo'
How is the popularity score calculated? 
Thank you!!
Missing [Tango with Django](https://www.amazon.com/Tango-Django-beginners-Development-Python-ebook/dp/B01N91N65Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1499189787&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=tango+with+django) for Web Dev Topical
I used the Amazon Bestseller Rank of the book to assign a score for popularity. This rank loosely indicates how many copies of the book were bought recently. I found this to be well correlated with quality (I know many of these books by experience, and I found that the ones that I already knew to be good books rose to the top). In addition, when you filter for topics in the beginner section, another score is assigned based on relevance to those topics. This was a bit more work. I went through the contents of the book manually and tagged each book by the topics it covers and the percentage of the book devoted to that topic. After the relevance score is computed, it is combined with the popularity score to get a final score.
I just moved my personal dev environment to digital ocean. Love the new host but it is a bit more pricy. I wrote a python script the other day to automate taking snapshots then destroying my biggest vm. Scheduled it using cron. The digital ocean api is pretty robust. 
Thanks for pointing that out. I started with the top 100 Python paperback books to seed the site. Unfortunately, Tango with Django is ebook only, so it didn't get included. But no worries, I will be adding more books very soon and it will be included shortly. I love the book. When I started with Django, it was the first thing I read (at that time just a website).
Glad you liked it.
You are technically correct; the best kind of correct. Though... this is fixing a problem I've never really had but once or twice, and that has been from **naively** copying that full selector/xpath/etc, which wouldn't work *anyway* since its not flexible enough for actual living html. And no, I don't write general purpose scrapers, they are site/data specific, since the "browser compliant" way you mention has almost never worked for me. There is literally no point to this for most cases, even though what you say is true. A poor speed tradeoff for no functional improvement in actual working code. But hey, its "correct" by some measure or other, so we gotta do it right?
&gt; Right, people doing web scraping while not knowing anything about the web and not expecting to ever learn about it. You’re conflating a querying language with the data itself. `bs4` has a document model which makes sense if you’ve learned it. Your initial comment suggested that `bs4`’s model is broken because the default parser is outdated. I showed that you can use `html5lib` like you suggested and then your criticism devolved to: "well everyone who’s a web developer already knows XPath and it’s not difficult". I responded by saying that `bs4` is also not difficult and then you suggested that the set of persons trying to scrape the web are the same set of persons who also develop for the web. I’m here to crash your party and tell you that those sets are actually different, though overlapping. Personally, I’m a data engineer, and I don’t do any web development, but I’ve scraped a lot of data that is available on the web. I’ve tried my hand at XPath before and I just find `bs4`’s data model simpler and more convenient. If you’re going to insist that my opinion is wrong, that’s fine, you’re entitled to that. But don’t insist that your opinions are better than everyone else’s.
It's one of the more frequent topics in r/learnpython. In particular, it tends to be an entry point for non-programmers, so they can easily get lost in documentation that's intended for programmers starting to do automation work.
Making a file manager in Qt, with direct access to tags a la Tabbles / Elyse. I've been having trouble with my usual FM (Thunar), and the others I tested weren't to my taste (xfe, spacefm, nautilus, etc..), so I decided to develop my own. I'm a hobbyist, developing on and off for years, so I'm not sure if I'll ever finish it but crossing fingers... 
Seconded. I'm at my brother's wedding festivities.
With the upcoming eclipse, I'm working on simplifying/automating taking pics on my GOTO scope. I've got one script that ties together: - a module I wrote to send/receive data with the GOTO interface - Picamera to capture images - Cwiid to move the scope with a wiimote/nunchuck pair All running on a Raspberry Pi. 
&gt; How do I port my code to python? Just translate all the Java to Python. But since you haven't worked with Python, this wouldn't make a lot of sense. And plus, you won't be able to use the Processing visual stuff in Python. About #2. Say the Python function you want to use is defined like this: def add(a, b): return a + b You could convert the same into a Java function like this: float add(int a, int b) { float sum = a + b; return sum; } Of course, if the function is defined in `numpy` or `skimage` it will be much more complicated than this. &gt; I get these libraries, where would I be putting them exactly? See this: https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/How-to-Install-a-Contributed-Library I found this after a quick google search. Maybe you could use one of the libraries there: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/482305/java-scientific-packages-similar-to-scipy &gt; I also found https://www.nodebox.net/code/index.php/About I'll take a look but I haven't seen this before. Have you taken a look at PyGame or Pyglet? &gt; I can show you the code too if it makes it easier. Sure. I'll see I can help. 
Nice site. Just for info, *Starting Out with Python* by Tony Gaddis is now on its 4th Edition. (It recently came out.) 
Thank you for taking the time to do this.
Yeah ill post it on the site!
Thanks for the heads up. Will be fixed when I next update the site.
Belgium! Did you check that it runs? Because you'll end up with 210 files, with names like "TRO F.pdf", "BDE F.pdf", "TRO i".pdf" etc. You also won't end up with a "Fiche de paie" which can be replaced. Also, naming. The prefix goes after the suffix, but you are putting the suffix first. And the date is manual. This section would probably end up being: from datetime import datetime as dt date = dt.strftime(dt.today(), '%Y-%M') description = 'Fiche de paie {}'.format(date) names = ("TRO", "BDE", "LBE", "GCO", "ITO", "FVB", "ANI", "WME", "CBE", "MNO") filenames = ['{} {}.pdf'.format(name, description) for name in names] It will also be faster to change the filename before you write it. For instance: filenames_french = ['{} {}.pdf'.format(name, description) for name in names] filenames = [filename.replace("Fiche de paie", "Loonfiche") for filename in filenames_french if filename.startswith(("GCO", "FVB", "ANI", "WME"))] Even better: description_french = 'Fiche de paie' description_dutch = 'Loonfiche' filenames = ['{name} {description} {date}.pdf'.format( name=name, description = description_dutch if name in ("GCO", "FVB", "ANI", "WME") else description_french), date=date, ) for name in names] Next, having all the names and preferences be manual is not a good thing. You might want to store them as a database or csv file (Name, Abbreviation, Language), and work from there. Ideally, pull it directly from the company database so that if a new employee is added it happens automatically. payslip_string = { "english": "payslip", "french": "Fiche de paie", "dutch": "Loonfiche", "german": "Gehaltsabrechnung", } filenames = ['{name} {description} {date}.pdf'.format( name=name, description=payslip_string[language], date=date, ) for name, language in employees] If employee is a class or a namedtuple, you can even do this: # namedtuple version from collections import namedtuple Employee = namedtuple('employee', 'name language') employees = [ Employee("TRO", "french"), Employee("BDE", "french"), Employee("LBE", "french"), Employee("GCO", "dutch"), Employee("ITO", "french"), Employee("FVB", "dutch"), Employee("ANI", "dutch"), Employee("WME", "dutch"), Employee("CBE", "french"), Employee("MNO", "french"), ] filenames = ['{name} {description} {date}.pdf'.format( name=employee.name, description=payslip_string[employee.language], date=date, ) for employee in employees] Also, what happens if the order changes for some reason? Would it be okay if TRO gets ITO's file? Better to check that the name on that page matches, and then do the replacement. Try not to hardcode anything, and try to use functions instead of putting everything in the main block of the code. This would allow you to build more complex applications in the future. For instance, that csv file/database could also contain their email addresses, and you could automatically send it to them too. def generate_filenames(employees, descriptions=payslip_string, date=date): for employee in employees: yield '{name} {description} {date}.pdf'.format( name=employee.name, description=payslip_string[employee.language], date=date, ) def split_pages(input_pdf): for i in range(input_pdf.numPages): output = PyPDF2.PdfFileWriter() output.addPage(inputpdf.getPage(i)) yield output def write_to_file(output, filename): with open(filename, 'wb') as f: output.write(f) def batch_write_to_file(outputs, filenames): for output, filename in zip(outputs, filenames): write_to_file(output, filename) if __name__ == '__main__': employees = read_employees('database/csv path file') # not implemented with open("File with all the payslips.PDF", "rb") as fin: input_pdf = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(fin) filenames = generate_filenames(employees) batch_write_to_file(split_pages(input_pdf), filenames) Consider using Python 3.6, which simplifies string formatting: f'{employee.name} {payslip_string[employee.language]} {date}.pdf' And another PDF library which is more Pythonic. For instance, I wanted to loop page by page, so you wouldn't need to use `split_pages`: def write_pages_to_files(input_pdf, filenames): for page, filename in zip(input_pdf, filenames): write_to_file(page, filename) I'm not sure if this exists, or if it's time for someone to buckle down and make one. Finally, be consistent with single (') or double(") quotes. Other than that, it is generally good.
Thanks. I had a lot of fun doing this.
Doing a few workshops from this year's Pycon.
Thanks for the suggestions. I'll give it a try.
It sounds to me like you are making the fatal mistake of trying to recruit people who already know Ruby. There's no point doing that, just interview good programmers, it's trivial to get up and running in new programming languages anyway. 
Yeah you are wrong. Prevention of stealing memory while it is in use requires special hardware, you are leaving behind sensitive data in memory after you are finished. Zeroing out buffers that stored sensitive data is a common practice in other languages. OpenSSL doesn't set mlock for various reasons, although there are popular patches that add this if you need the this functionality. But not swapping to disk and even trying to bother cleaning up secrets left behind in memory are independent of each other. Plenty of CVEs have been given out for doing exactly what privy does. What problem is your library even trying to solve? You have functions to make the secret "expire" after peek but it's still available in memory, that's a little bit misleading. It looks like this is marketed to people that are concerned about the secrecy of their variables and memory attacks. 
&gt; Made while drinking 🍺 in Munich. Prost! Very cool project. I like how you use GitHub issues for the reviews, which makes me ask whether pythonbooks.org is a static site?
Prost! I am handling the reviews using the GitHub API. Every time the detail page is loaded, it pulls the comments from the associated issue page. However, to prevent making too many calls to the GitHub API, the comments are cached for about 10 mins. So if you leave a review, it will take approx 10 mins to show up on the site.
Yes, my plan is to add 5 new books per week. I estimated that there are about 600 Python books in the wild, and the site indexes only the top 100 right now. So would take a while before the site can claim completeness. Also, new books are coming out all the time and those need to be added as well. 
I'm starting heavy studying and practice with Django! Also going to start looking into databases and that sort of thing.
Word of advice: when I started Python I tended to hoard books and expect them to make me a better programmer, but nothing beats actual coding on concrete projects. I would suggest picking up ONE comprehensive book and get started on projects right away, starting with very simple stuff like FizzBuzz if I you have no programming background (r/dailyprogrammer has great project ideas). You will learn much more by actually coding than just reading different books. My go-to reference is Learning Python, it is quite extensive (1500 pages) but it has everything you need to get started and study more complex topics. Also, if you are coming from a different language, I would recommend checking idiomatic Python guidelines in order to be more effective. Enjoy, programming in Python is fun.
Just do it.
Thanks!
This is good advice. I also got the most out of coding projects. However, I think that the most effective way of learning Python depends a lot on the person. If you are very hands on and creative, coding projects is the right way to go. On the other hand, there are many who would benefit from reading a book cover to cover before jumping on to real world projects - it just makes you more confident. For example, reading [Two Scoops of Django](http://pythonbooks.org/two-scoops-of-django-best-practices-for-django-18/) made me truly confident in using Django. In addition, there are many books that are quite application oriented e.g. [Python Crash Course](http://pythonbooks.org/python-crash-course-a-hands-on-project-based-introduction-to-programming/) or [Automate the Boring Stuff](http://pythonbooks.org/automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python-practical-programming-for-total-beginners/) so you get the best out of both worlds.
I feel like I'm at the stage you describe here. I need to hoard less and practice more.
&gt; Zeroing out buffers that stored sensitive data is a common practice in other languages. Python, Ruby, Node, etc. can't do that and the JVM does not provide an API for that. Does that make Instagram, GitHub, LinkedIn, Netflix, etc. user auth fundamentally insecure? &gt; What problem is your library even trying to solve? As explained clearly in the readme, it's for using passwords to encrypt "secret data such as API keys, cryptocurrency wallets, or seeds for digital signatures.". See https://github.com/ofek/privy#usage
Kivy and KivEnt support desktop platforms just as much as mobile ones. In fact, for games the differences are relatively unimportant, as the game itself will tend to be essentially platform independent (not using e.g. native widgets).
You can put a nested json into a dataframe with `pd.io.json.json_normalize` and then just try/except for `data.locale.MetadataAlbum.locale.language` Or you can skip the dataframe part and just trasform the nested json into a dict with pd.io.json.nested_to_record
Working on improving a script that automates some work software via pyautogui. I have a database where each job is listed. I also have several computers that are set via task scheduler to run the python script every 10 minutes. The script first checks the database to see if it's set as currently running a job, if so it then looks for a XML output from the software to see if that has finished running. If it is it will mark the job as finished, then pick up the next job and start the software. So far this system has been very effective as it can run over the weekend and work through 10-15 jobs, when before it could only do one as it would require users to set up the job.
I have been trying to create an web app based on this ted talk and this app: [1 Second Everyday.](http://1se.co/) I have been using flask, sqlalchemy and ffmpeg. Still learning, but I think my code is a mess :/
Cool to see stuff coming out of Munich. Last week it was StackImpact, and now this!
Using another script as a basis, I wrote a script that communicates with a network analyzer in my internship. I'm not necessarily a programmer (physics major) but it was exciting to write a program that didn't exist before!
Working on an app that brings in options data (google or yahoo finance) for a stock, runs some calculations, and then I think I'll try displaying that in the new Dash library, or might just make a small tkinter gui. The idea is to find profitable and high probability trade ideas. I can do it for a stock or two, but it's impossible to do it across the market without automation.
You are a very nice person. I like you.
Thanks. I am at the [TU Munich](https://www.tum.de/) and I really love the atmosphere in the informatics department and at the entrepreneurship center here. 
This week I've been working on a macro program for mouse input. You can record, save, load and play mouse sequences any number of times.
Very kind of you to say that. Thanks.
I see what you mean. I too prefer someone who can think, because then they can do anything. But, most people we talked with want to gain experience in something valid (to this area). Knowing Ruby is useful, and still benefit you on the long run. Id argue is even fun to learn new languages. But most people prefer to go deeper with programming languages that are relevant around. 
Cool cheat-sheet, thanks :)
Very cool and useful. I would put the year published or date next to the title of the books. I tend to avoid older books due to all the changes in libraries and syntax that have been implemented.
Thanks for the info. Certainly an interesting way of integrating content by users.
Thanks. Yes, a friend of mine also told me the same thing about publication date. I will put it in the next time I update the site.
I'm guessing that based on what you said both Ruby and Python will results the same results (won't allow you to join the two types), as both are strongly typed languages. Javascipt I'm guessing is weakly typed language and will different results (probably some strange string starting with`foo`). Will check it with online REPL when I'm home :P
Also, if you want to remove the old books from the view, there's an alternate way. There's a publication date filter. On the desktop and tablets, it should be on the left hand side. On the mobile, there's a collapsible filter on the top. Just set it to an year and you will only see books that were published after that year.
Reading the documentation is the way to go, of course, but not always is the documentation exhaustive.

I'm a python dev that recently took up a Rails job. TDD is very common in python, but that has nothing to do with the language. The best testing library is pytest imo. Vim is somewhat common, and I primarily develop in vim using the py-mode plugin. I also use pycharm. As far as the language being slow to change, eh, I think it's going at an ideal pace. It's a bit harder to answer that, but you could look over recent PEPs (changes). However to me python and ruby are incredibly similar. I prefer the python syntax, but it was very easy to pick up rails. All the same things seem to work. Python is a much more popular language outside of webdev though. 
Do it.
Build a bot to do it for you :D
And you know the exact specifics of their auth system how? I would find it odd if any site of their size had authentication calls embedded directly into the main web code. What is more likely is a dedicated system that returns an authentication tokens to the main web code; easier to segregate the auth database and monitor for usual traffic between the systems that way. The problem isn't that it secrets can be stolen while they are in use, the problem is that applications that run as a daemon could leak all the secrets ever used. They are two fundamentally different threat models. You are not even trying to protect against the second threat model. You can try to do this to make exploits less likely to occur like [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20100929111257/http://www.codexon.com/posts/clearing-passwords-in-memory-with-python) then make privy always use subprocesses and suggest passing secrets to it directly via file descriptors; using mutable data types instead of strings is another way to make a successful exploit less likely. 
I follow a similar model, the saying "never roll your own crypto" should really be "never roll your own crypto and put it into production". For example manually creating/building certificates using the cryptography's hazmat classes is an excellent way to learn how certificates really work and what all the little pieces that go into them are.
Right now I am contributing\consuming a proprietary framework for a network security company. It has pytest, request, selenium, aplitools, and many other libraries integrated to test the front and back ends of our intellectual properties. Personally I have been: - Paralellizing our test suites to run at as many threads as you can throw at it. - Creating a setting for retry methods on tests that will send a request again if a certain http status is returned. - Creating tests that will take a list of dict of properties and create every possible combination of the indexes or items of the object and make tests for those combinations. #BOASTING
I am self-taught; my undergrad and grad studies were in literature and philosophy. I work as a developer... so it is possible to get a job as a self-taught person. 
Funny there are still these lxml+xpath/css select vs beautifulsoup arguments still. Maybe 5 or 6 years ago when I started web scraping with bs, I was told to learn to lxml+xpath. I stuck with BS since I didnt want to learn yet another api and there were not any tutorials on lxml with xpath. Just recently lxml tutorials with xpath came out so I tried them out. The result for me? I couldn't really find the difference and thought either of them were ok and did the job. I guess my point is use whatever you feel most comfortable with. Learning lxml+xpath was not difficult at all. It is confusing though as to when I should use xpath vs css selectors. So for me, the experience was a wash. For a beginner, I would definitely recommend BS first, especially if they don't have a strong html background.
Kivy/KivEnt is really powerful and has excellent documentation. However, it can be quite hard to wrap ones head around the whole entity-component-system (ecs) architecture used by KivEnt. Pyglet isn't an engine at all but it is a nice wrapper for using OpenGL from Python. I found the documentation for Pyglet quite easy to follow and you can always look at base OpenGL documentation/tutorials to aid understanding of how it works. Cocos2d (as far as I remember) is based on Pyglet so if you really want/need to you can always make raw Pyglet calls to render stuff like special effects. I know what you mean about the Cocos2d documentation though. I found that looking through the examples helped me quite a bit. Also, the documentation in the source itself is pretty decent - read the docstrings! Finally, if you think your game could work like an ascii graphics roguelike you could always check out BearLibTerminal and tdl. 
Arcade looks really good. Nice find.
Was it easy to get the current job you have?
I'm I the same boat. Do you know any places I could work on a project with other beginners?
No, it was pretty hard; I taught myself for about a year while I worked in a development adjacent position, then did a stint at the Recurse Center, and then started sending out resumes and interviewing. I'm in a very hot market (NYC), but getting my foot in the door still took more than half a year of putting in several hours a day just looking for a job, not to mention continuing to code personal projects and do freelance webdev. Having a CS degree makes you a stronger candidate for most positions, and if that's an option for you and you want to be a developer, you should do that. 
How did you track in the depth dimension?
I don't. Which is why it's inaccurate. It's just 2d and the dot which tracks the bird just moves within this plane only.
You may get better results by asking at /r/learnpython
True, but for small, throwaway data sets, this is obviously easier than setting up a database.
Good on you for your dedication! I'm kinda just testing the water right now, because at this point I have no idea what I wanna do with my life, but if I do decide to go into softer developing I'll go to university for CS. I honestly don't think I could put in several hours a day just TRYING to get a job. And if having a CS degree will give me an advantage, I'll take it! And besides I think I'd wanna have the whole college experience, just so I can say "I did it." Anyway sorry for rambling on for so long! And your input is very much appreciated 🙂
I wrote a tool to help AWS customers save time and money when they need to make massive AWS Snowball exports. Now it is available at https://github.com/awslabs/s3bundler
Oo, okay. You could try and do that with another camera at a known distance if you want, or with one that is seeing in the other axis.
Yeah, that's the future plan. I am thinking of watching the x-z axis, putting the camera at the top. Do you have suggestion for cameras? I am using logitech right now, but it might be too pricey to get another one.
Thank you for pointing that out! Fixed :)
What do you mean? Do you want to change the value of an item in a list, or move an item to a different spot in the list?
I want to change the value increasing +1 
Actually I'm having trouble with the whole exercise. I'm gonna translate the whole thing if you could help you'll be practically saving my life. An electric motor company is concerned about the final quality of its motors produced on the assembly line. Because its manufacturing process is still not completely consistent and numerous engines are produced with different characteristics on the same assembly line. Although almost all the engines can be sold in the market, the company wants to maximize its profits and its visibility in the market, so the goal set for this year is to have a production of 90% of class A engines and less than 1% of engines Class D. However, the company has difficulties identifying where the problems are in the production of its motors, there are some hypotheses, but it is necessary to validate them. For this the company wishes to evaluate each one of this hypothesis in isolation every day in the manufacturing process. All engines produced in a day are evaluated by a test team, this team evaluates in each engine the following parameters: 1- engine works 2 - average engine speed oscillations 3- Engine speed change response time Each engine tested should be classified into one of the following 4 classes: A B C D Engines in class D are defective engines and should be directed to the engine recycling line. This is worse case because the company is losing money. Engines in class C are motors with rotational oscillations greater than 10%, these motors get buyers in the market, however the company is noticing a trend of lower demand for them. Engines in class B are motors with rotational oscillations greater than 2% and less than or equal to 10% and the response time greater than 3 seconds. The company has a good market for these engines, however, Motor Feliz SA wants to be known in the market as a class A engine company. Engines that do not fit into any of the above characteristics are class A motors. These are the company's goal. You are present in the engineering team who must evaluate the hypotheses of changes in the production line and maximize the production of Motors class A. Until this moment the engine test team only records the data of each engine in a sheet of paper and label The same in the test line. This process is time-consuming and makes it difficult to see the production data for each day in real time, making the decision process slower. You remembered the programming classes you had at engineering school and decided to create a small python program to facilitate this analysis. This program should read production data for each engine (it works, average outages and response) each day. At the end of the day, how many engines were produced in each of the classes (A, B, C, D) should be calculated and a line chart should be presented comparing the number of engines produced in each class during the production days. Your program should read at least 5 days of information. What will be evaluated at work: 1- Reading the data of each engine and classification in the correct class. 2- Correct storage of how many engines were processed each day in each class. 3- Presentation of the graph comparing the production of engines in each class between the days.
You missed Grey Hat Python for computer Security. Same author as Blackhat Python. Awesome list!
Okay, so first you want to figure how to classify engines. I presume you get a list where each entry is another list of the three parameters. Progress through that list (whatever the size), and using conditionals, you can classify what the engine is pretty easily. Next is storing that data. I presume this is where your initial question is from, and I suggest that instead of a list, you use a dictionary where the keys are "A", "B", "C", and "D". Each day, the values for those entries start off at zero, and in your evaluation program above, you simply write `produced_engines["Class Letter"] += 1`. Obviously, you can nest that dictionary within another dictionary, creating one of those records per day. For the final presentation, use your python graphing library of choice, and make a line graph which will have four lines; each line represents a class of engine, the y-axis represents the number produced, and the x-axis represents the day of production. I think this should be within your capabilities, but if it's not, keep at it; this is an excellent teaching exercise that lets you show your skill in multiple different fundamental aspects of programming.
My only 3rd week with Python ever and I think was looking for some books anyway, so I guess this helps a lot. Thanks! Cool stuff
You would get better help if you tell what your problem really is, not just post the question... Seriously, the good way for a programmer to ask a question is &gt; Think &gt; Translate your thoughts into a program &gt; Debug &gt; Read docs &gt; More debug &gt; Don't know why it's not working &gt; Ask Not &gt; Ask which only makes you a lazy student. Optionally, you can always &gt; Ask and offer a payment.
Thanks so much for your help, Flynn!! I was thinking about starting creating a list for each motor class, where the index is the total of some day, but I didn't know how to modify the value of an index ex: motorsA = [10,23,9,12] motorsB = [5,7,8,7]
Looks like a post for /r/learnpython . 
Finished porting rfcat to python3. Started in December, but took my time :)
Ok, I'm not and native english speaker so i have difficulties do express myself and found it easier to just translate the whole problem. My question is how can i change the number of and index of a list increasing with the number of motors that is putted
Interested to see what you're doing here. Are you using option volume and open interest as your criteria? 
&gt; If you are about to ask a question, please consider r/learnpython or the learn python discord. Homework-style questions will be removed, and you'll be encouraged to post there instead. Anyway, what's your current code?
[html5lib](https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-python) has seen no updates on github for almost a year. Look at the releases tab, 07/15/2016. The [latest release on pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/html5lib) is also dated 07/15/2016 Looks dead to me...
A really nice and useful site! And I think you should add [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1499213679&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=hands-on+machine+learning+with+scikit-learn+and+tensorflow) for Machine Learning as soon as possible.
I'm working on moving the front end of my project from the Django templating system to Vue.js. That also means migrating the current project to Django REST Framework. But switching to Vue will give me a lot more flexibility. Here's my project: https://github.com/hmhrex/tenma
Yes, I know. Someone already emailed me pointing out that omission. Thanks for catching it. Will be fixed soon.
Glad this is helpful for you. Best of luck with your Python journey. It's the best language I know.
Thanks. Yes, my book list is a few months old and this book came out very recently. I will add this in the very first update, the book looks awesome. 
already posted there thanks for the suggestion
Just picked up Learn Python The Hard Way...chapter 9! :-)
Yes do it
the error is in function 'gameq2' else statement 
I had to miss some classes and i'm pretty lost, so i think its quite wrong I know that these parts for i in range(0,4): motorC[dia,+1] are wrong, and thats where my doubt is, I hope I could express what the doubt is Here's the code: motorA = [] motorB = [] motorC = [] motorD = [] day = int(raw_input("Type the day ")) while day != "exit": work = str(raw_input("Type if the motor works or exit")) while work == "no": for i in range(0,4): #tried to increase the index number equivalent to the day number motorD[day,+1] break while work == "yes": rotation = raw_input("Type the rotation media or exit ") while rotation != "sair": if float(rotation) &gt; 10: for i in range(0,4): motorC[dia,+1] break elif float(rotation) &gt; 2 and float(rotation) &lt;= 10: time = float(raw_input("How muck was the answer time? ")) if time &gt; 3 : for i in range (0,4): motorB[day,+1] break else: for i in range (0,4): motorA[day,+1] break elif float(rotation) &lt;2: for i in range (0,4): motorA[day,+1] break if rotation == "exit": funciona = str(raw_input("Type if the motor works or exit ")) if work == "exit": day = raw_input("Type the day") if str(i) == "day": break
why would you expect a parser to "work" if what you are parsing isn't (legal) html?
oh cool, thanks.
just making a text based game of the funzies it's actually my first project, probably going to take a look at the read write function 
wow, a show-and-tell post that's actually good. 'grats
You could use better formatting... In Reddit new line is two line breaks
But the real question is "Was it written in Python?" 😂 Thanks for this, I look forward to checking some of these books out!
You might be interested in [this post](https://carreau.github.io/posts/24-Viridisify.html#Viridisify) to see a slightly different approach.
What exactly is this motorD[day,+1] doing?
Thanks! Glad you liked it.
Thanks and of course! The backend is written in Django. Wouldn't have it any other way.
Just start, and then see what problems crop up. If you need an arithmetic library that doesnt yield floating-point errors, look up a library that does that. If you need a simple graphical user interface library, look up a library that does that. Just don't over think it :-)
Thanks for the tip... it's definately better now
That's where my question is, I tried to add +1 in the list in the index number equivalent of the variable day. I've tried a lot of diferent things, this code is just the most recent attempt
I see. Are you looking for motorD[day] += 1 ? btw, you should check day != "exit" before you cast day into int
This is a great resource for the community - thank you for it! I'm curious as to where the list of books comes from, and how they get categorized. Is that done manually? In particular, I didn't see [Lutz' "Learning Python"](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Python-5th-Mark-Lutz/dp/1449355730/) on the site, but it is listed in the GitHub issues. That's one I could definitely provide a review of!
[removed]
The book (out of my same beginner hoard of books) that helped me the most was **Think Python**. Good mix of Python basics, plus cool little homework problems which highlighted practical use of the language. It's also totally free online: http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.pdf 
The college experience is very much worth it. I'd suggest going to a state school, if you're in the states, anyway, because student loan debt is horrible. Best of luck, and keep hacking! 🙂
Cringy wizard multiplayer game (WITHOUT PYGAME!!!)
still didn't work, the lists goes out empty what is wrong? The code is like this motorA = [] motorB = [] motorC = [] motorD = [] day = int(raw_input("Type the day or exit ")) while str(day) != "exit": work = str(raw_input("Type if the motor works or exit")) while work == "no": for i in range(0,len(motorD)): motorD[day]+= 1 break while work == "yes": rotation = raw_input("Type the rotation ") while rotacoes != "exit": if float(rotation) &gt; 10: for i in range(0,len(motorC)): motorC[day] += 1 break elif float(rotation) &gt; 2 and float(rotation) &lt;= 10: time = float(raw_input("What was the answer time? ")) if time &gt; 3 : for i in range (0,len(motorB)): motorB[day] += 1 break else: for i in range (0,len(motorA)): motorA[day] +=1 break elif float(rotation) &lt;2: for i in range (0,len(motorA)): motorA[day] += 1 break if rotation == "exit": work = str(raw_input("Type if the motor works or exit ")) if work == "exit": day = raw_input(" Type the day ") if str(day) == "exit": break
I second this recommendation. Finished the book ~ 6 weeks ago and learned a ton.
Not in states rn, but do hope to make it back by time I have to go to college. And yes I do here student loans can be quite a pain. And thanks 🙏🏽 
I haven't done that in a while, so I don't have any recommendations. On the other hand, since the Pi isn't that powerful, I'm guessing that you'll need to downsample (decrease the resolution). In this case, a cheap low res one would work just as well as a fancy one.
OK... you have to initialize your lists first. How many days to you have in total? Do something like motorA = [0, 0, 0, 0] Or you can use a dict instead And again, you cannot do day = int(raw_input("Type the day or exit ")) If you type "exit" there will be an exception. Check for "exit" first and then cast the variable into int
For numerical / engineering problems, I strongly recommend Numerical Python by Robert Johansson. The book isn't about Python, but how to apply it to (in my opinion) real-world scientific use cases. His GitHub code repo is here: https://github.com/jrjohansson/numerical-python-book-code
Be sure to check out all the Nostarch books (https://www.nostarch.com/catalog/python)
Thanks and very nice catch. It was a bug in the database that prevented the book from showing up. I have fixed it now. [Here it is](http://pythonbooks.org/learning-python-5th-edition/). Feel free to leave a review. The list of books comes from Amazon. But this list is huge - it has almost all Python paperbacks ever published. So the list is trimmed down based on popularity and publication date (anything published earlier than 2009 is not included as they are outdated). I did the categorization manually and also filled in the metadata by browsing a little bit/using the book preview feature on Amazon. 
Thanks. I have all of them in my database, I just need to categorize them and fill in the metadata. Then they can go in the site. The plan is to do 5 books per week from now on. So in a few months, all the books should be there.
When I put the data of the first day, it enters all wrong, for exemplo, one motor turns into 5 inside the list, and when I go to the second day appears this error on the line 23: TypeError: list indices must be integers, not str The code is motorA = [0,0,0,0,0] motorB = [0,0,0,0,0] motorC = [0,0,0,0,0] motorD = [0,0,0,0,0] exit = 0 #I think that's what you said about the exit day = int(raw_input("Type the day or exit ")) while str(day) != "exit": work = str(raw_input("Type if the motor works or exit")) while work == "no": for i in range(0,len(motorD)): motorD[day]+= 1 break while work == "yes": rotation = raw_input("Type the rotation or exit ") while rotation != "exit": if float(rotation) &gt; 10: for i in range(0,len(motorC)): motorC[day]+= 1 break elif float(rotation) &gt; 2 and float(rotation) &lt;= 10: time = float(raw_input("What was the answer time? ")) if time &gt; 3 : for i in range (0,len(motorB)): motorB[day]+= 1 break else: for i in range (0,len(motorA)): motorA[day]+=1 break elif float(rotation) &lt;2: for i in range (0,len(motorA)): motorA[day]+= 1 break if rotation == "exit": work = str(raw_input("Type if the motor works or exit ")) if work == "exit": day = raw_input(" Type the day ") if str(day) == "exit": break 
Yes, among other things. Max pain theory will be part of it, probability of an option (or more complex strategy) ending ITM will be where I want to play with it a bunch. I've implemented a reinforcement learning (q learning) trading algorithm before, applied to the underlying stocks, but I want to try that in the context of more complex strategies as well, for a stretch goal. Initial goal is a helper tool for "at a glance" option market understanding though.
What is line 23 Also, have you ever tried input "exit" and see if your program works as expected? :\
Is there a way for others to submit books or add to the list? Wiki, GitHub PR, etc?
Build a bot to automate the automation blog bot building process IMO!
How about pytest? I only see examples with the simplest arithmetic functions. You could show a test for a realistic string processing module. Or a request / response function parser, use mock where needed. Calculate test coverage.
Unfortunately, not at this point. It's just me going down the list by popularity and filling in the info. But I can try to find a way to do this in the future. The major problem is : my database is not very clean, I have multiple editions of the same book, which needs to be merged and I don't want to open it up for crowdsourcing before the database is clean and I have an automated process to detect duplicates and omissions. Give me a bit of time. It's on my to do list.
Maybe `async`/`await`? It is something I've been struggling and failing to grok for some time.
