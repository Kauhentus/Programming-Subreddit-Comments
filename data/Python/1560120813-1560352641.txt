Yes
The line 153 is wrong. `range` is a function and not a Dictionary. The line should be `grid = [[(0, 0, 0) for x in range(10)] for x in range(20)]`. I would suggest to, at least, separate this into two lines.
I've been trying to follow a tutorial video and that's just the way the guy had it.. I'll try that instead though, thanks!
A bit of both :). A random game is queued every minute.
Yeah predicting the winner of the match in the roadmap. Currently the winner is stored along with the true duration when the game ends.
Option #5 is to never talk to her again. That'll trick her.
Whoops, you’re right! I was thinking `print(“hello”+”world”)` Which would output `helloworld`
You could use Visual studio codes live share extension but that will be limited to having one guy having the code and the rest live sharing and being able to edit that. But if you want a program which anyone can access anytime try using juypter, I haven’t used it much yet but it seems pretty handy for collaboration type projects!

I'll check that out. From what I've seen (before the speed issue killed it for me), it was kinda nice.
What kind of model did you use?
Git isn't a real-time collaborative coding tool, it's a (distributed) version control system. This means it's used to manage changes to files over time, with the ability to maintain the entire history of changes, as well as different "branches" which can later be merged (and lots of other features). Since git is _distributed_ that means you can also have multiple people contributing to the same codebase. They all copy the _remote_ repository from somewhere like github, then they work on their _local_ copy. When they are ready, they can _push_ their changes up to the remote repo or _pull_ down other changes that have been published. Git is complex but definitely worth learning if you want to get further into writing code. Nonetheless, in the meantime, do a search for "realtime code collaboration" on Google and you'll find lots of options for what you might want. In a professional setting, real time code collaboration (or pair programming) is often performed in a surprisingly low tech way: two people look at the same monitor, talk to each other, and one of them types. Asynchronous collaboration is usually performed with git, as I explained above. One developer working on one feature might have their own branch that they're working on. When it's ready, they push it to Github (or wherever) and have it reviewed by someone else, then it is merged into the master branch (or development branch, or so on, depending on the workflow used) and other developers can pull that down into the branches they're working on.
Well you can always add features now. I love playing with my USB microscope and was excited to see the post. Now I'm going to be a typical user and demand more features like auto-focus and digital zooming.

This subreddit is for things related to the programming language Python, not for things related to snakes. Your comment has been removed, but if it's cute enough, you might try posting to /r/aww
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/python. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!

That your robot communicates with good grammar is great. Also, it looks like you use chats for scheduling. It would be interesting to see how the model would deal with conversations that include like more chatty interactions.
the problem is if u are checking for 0 or 1 add base cases u can do this using sieve of erathosthenes or recursion otherwise this code worjs but isnt very efficient idk the job market im still in high school
Job market is pretty great for people who specialize. Remember for most tasks, programming is a powerful means to an end. If you're interested in learning more or tutoring, please feel free to message me! Affordable rates!
Literally get off on this shit. &amp;#x200B; Reason being; it's life. There is a study being done/has been done on [microtubules](https://discovermagazine.com/bonus/quantum) &amp;#x200B; &gt; Orch-OR, suggests that structures called microtubules, which transport material inside cells, underlie our conscious thinking. &amp;#x200B; What's happening at the most basic levels of our biology, is that a 'cylindrical' structure allows the "charge" (I think of it as a charge, I forget what they call it though) to move around in a cylindrical function - otherwise known as the wave function. Each charge is the 'observer'. The rest of the structure is it's "track". &amp;#x200B; Now check this out; After an initial charge has made it's rounds, and power is shut off. When power is turned back on (when they apply the charge), it works more efficiently. It remembers the charge! &amp;#x200B; I think the next step should be in application of multiple charge types. See if it can remember multiple charges. If it does, this pretty much means that consciousness is 'remembered charge'. &amp;#x200B; Now, we can kind of get into fractals. Fractals are the layman geometrical pattern that these microtubules abide by! Every fucking thing, in our universe, works in the same way. To see it correctly (It may not be correct, but the insights you can observe by doing so are astounding), you need to pair geometry to an abstraction of an object. &amp;#x200B; **Objects** I won't bore you with my long winded explanation of objects, instead I'll use a metaphor. &amp;#x200B; Imaging a canvas. We throw red paint at it. Some of the canvas now has red on it, and other parts are the default material. Next we throw green, and brown, and yellow. Now we break it into "puzzle pieces". We rearrange the pieces and throw another couple colors on the canvas. What we now have is puzzle pieces that have between 0 and max amount of colors we threw. Puzzle pieces with the same color will share influence on those 'color' frequencies. We then notice that this could also be thought of as dimensions the objects can observe. &amp;#x200B; That's to say objects can communicate on frequencies they can observe. Other objects may be unaware of their existence. Further, objects can learn about objects they don't have the senses to detect by looking at the behavior of objects they can observe; those objects would either have more, the same, or less frequencies that can be observed. (Like detecting unseen black holes by looking at the effect on other planets and their deviation from standard). &amp;#x200B; **Geometry** &amp;#x200B; Each point on a line is a dimension an object can observe. By simply drawing lines, you can suddenly monitor behavior of all objects. &amp;#x200B; **Fractals** &amp;#x200B; Jumping right into fractals because it is geometry. Think of the location of the 'cursor' as an object. At any given moment, it is part of a polygon, but it's not the same polygon as before, it's a new one, based on all previous drawn lines. &amp;#x200B; That's to say our past affects are current, and more scarily, more hypothetically, our future effects our current. This is where synchronicity, magik, and more really out there stuff comes in; however, I think those are attempts to explain what they saw, and are not to be taken literally. &amp;#x200B; My belief is that time is more like a fluid, and when an event happens anywhere, it sends ripples through time. &amp;#x200B; People showcasing advanced abilities in predictive power are likely connected on some level to the event in the future. It's not that they are predicting it, they are subconsciously reading the waves of the event. Hypothetical, and should definitely be taken with a grain of salt, as I'm still observing. &amp;#x200B; The entire fractal is time, the cursor point is the observers location in time. &amp;#x200B; That's not all though, the entire fractal explains in an abstraction how everything works. Instead of thinking of the entire fractal as time, consider it a sight line. This leads to the insight that there are penultimate observers and lesser observers. (because you're observing the observer). &amp;#x200B; No consider the entire fractal all perceivable colors, or sounds. The entirety of the fractal is the range of colors for that dimension. The observer inside can only view the colors at the point it is within the fractal. You as the penultimate can see all that range of colors, but then you are also part of a dimension that has a range of different or same colors, and a penultimate viewer of you. Same for sounds, the fractal is all sounds the object will hear during it's period of observation or at any given moment. &amp;#x200B; Imagine looking through a porthole and seeing our entire universe and all that is. That's the penultimate for our dimension if it exists (highly likely, even if there are no observers there in a conscious sense). It's similar to us throwing paint on a canvas. We become the penultimate of that canvas, while something else is likely the penultimate of our canvas that we live on/in. &amp;#x200B; My pet theory on the creation of the universe is that it's actually less like a big bang, and more like a waterfall of dimensional objects. I think the 3D objects we see, fell through dimensional space, from it's starting point in a higher dimension (four or more spatially). When they hit, they splatter like dropping marbles onto a floor. &amp;#x200B; I also think it's less like all objects drop to 3 Dimensions, and more like they drop until they hit the 'space' they were 'designated' for. Like a coin machine, except with spatial dimensions.
I strongly reccommend you learn git. I use upwards of 50 git commands per day. It's a very useful tool! To start with, you may want to use a GUI frontend to Git. I recommend GitKraken for this. They have a series of tutorials aimed for beginners like yourself: https://support.gitkraken.com/start-here/guide/ Git is a large, complicated piece of software. Don't expect to understand it all at once. To get basic functionality, all you need to know is how to commit file(s), push commits, and pull commits. Merging is a great next step.
Well done and thanks for your contribution (and I'm a user of the project you contributed to, double-thanks!)
Job market seems good from the perspective of a college student. I'm getting paid $21/hr as an intern who just graduated sophomore year. Plus $1000 housing stipend. Next year I'd make minimum $24/hr at the same company. Not sure if I'm coming back yet though, I really like the company but it's not the area of programming I'm most interested in.
I like the videos by Corey Schafer.
Yes this should work for Manjaro.
very true
compared to the db queries, json is a blip in the time line.
Please post the code even if it’s sloppy, ugly, or incomplete. Let others benefit from what you’ve done. Too much code is never posted because it’s not “polished” enough and folks are left only sleigh the vase examples from docs and not tea world usage examples! I swear I’m going to write a bit that posts this message one of these days (I’ll even post its ugliness to GitHub)
You can automate something that you do in your work, for example i work in networking so my first project was a script to change SNMP configurations in 20 juniper routers.
woa this is awesome !!!!!!!!! i can't even start thinking how to do that!!!!
pycharm community is very good, i have used visual studio code but Pycharm is by far more comfortable for me, community version is free and you can use it in linux/mac/windows
true, i haven’t had an issue at all with pycharm in my 3 laptops, one is a mac book 2018 and the other two are dell with no more than 16G of RAM. One of them have 16 G of RAM and runs in linux mint.
same syntax error? im pretty sure is what the fellows users have points out about the bracket
try printing out that return, i think have to be indented inside the loop?
[You can check the speed-up in my new script here. The new speed shows the info grab before the in-game notification even shows up](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/byox9n/update_to_my_fallout_4_script_it_is_much_faster/)
But it is 7:40 in the morning.
It makes it really really really hard to separate out different pieces of code which means it is hard to unit test and add new features. Source: i work on stuff written in the 60s when all they had was global memory and everything is way more painful, slow, and expensive because of it, _everything_.
This is based on really limited experience on your part. Read APIs often return cached data 99% of the time, for example, and in this case, serialization is often the biggest overhead.
A better take on this is to always use names spaces. My name is unique, I'm the only Mybrid in seven billion people on this planet, that's by design. So if I write a Python class and name it "Mybrid" then I guaranteed that all variables contained in that name space only pertain to the class Mybrid. Asset the positive, always used a dedicated name space.
&gt;This is based on really limited experience on your part. that's quite a claim arrogantowl since you have no idea who I am or what my experience is. caching reads only works for static data, and if you're going to cache, then you may as well cache the json response as well. thus avoiding more \`slow\` shit. The truth of the matter is still that getting it out of the database is the long pull on the order of about 5-10x depending on the app.
Using global variables makes it tougher to reason about and test a function that uses them. When we don't use global variables, we should be able to determine the effect executing a function has on state solely from its return value. However, using global variables means the execution of my function now relies on variables that aren't included in its signature or return value. This makes it harder to reason about functions, and harder to write good tests because we now have to model a more complex state.
Nice
I would suggest looking into Keras. It is a deep learning framework, that is very simple to use. Deep learning is essentially neural networks with many layers. A good introduction to deep learning in Keras is 'Deep Learning in Python' by François Chollet. If you have further questions, do not hesitate to ask.
Use type hints and it gets a lot closer to static-typed level features.

My PyCharm also grinds, I have 32 cores and 50GB of RAM.
Thank you! Are the possibilities with Keras the same and do the deep learning frameworks generally have the same syntax? If one is more preferred than another and Keras isn’t an introduction to like tensorflow or a more sophisticated deep learning software wouldn’t it be better just to learn the more difficult one? Once again I really appreciate the help.
Keras works fine by itself, and is actually built on top of TensorFlow, so if you decide that you want to make something that is not supported by Keras, you can easily write it using TensorFlow. The possibilities are essentially the same because of this. I wouldn't say that Keras is easier than TensorFlow, but it is a bit faster to go from idea to prototype.
Issue?
I have no idea what any of this means but I want to learn more

Thank you for the feedback .. I will go improve the documentation now :D
The essentials are this... Look at any situation as objects producing and responding to waves. Objects have transmitters and receivers. If they can communicate (react) to a frequency, then they are reacting at all times to the frequency. A simple explanation is "Blind people can't see". They are ignorant to what "sight" is. They don't have the receiver capable of picking up that data type. Now consider that same blind person listening to someone else. They are receiving information that the other object is 'transmitting'. The information taken in results in a constant struggle (most basic probably vibrations). The object is always responding to the information taken in. If they ever agreed with each other, they'd likely become a binded object (Without the struggle, it would mean they arrived at an agreement - an agreement that can be broken by other objects, but those two binded objects would stay bound otherwise). Transmissions are more like internal states being shared externally. Receivers are more like external states that alter the internal state. Now, what if I told you that the above could be represented as two circles; one having a number representing all available senses, the other having all minus one (sight). With humans, it seems silly a bit, but then you consider worms vs humans. Consider their transmitters and receivers vs ours. Now consider there is likely intelligent life forms out there or here that we just can't perceive. We can't view their frequency. If we want to find out where these objects are that we can't perceive, we'd need to look for unusual behavior in objects (or develop the receiver as a species for the frequency). Most likely there is not hostile life in our immediate vicinity that we need to worry about. If there was, we'd likely have developed a sense by now or be dead. That doesn't mean it's not here, it just means it's unlikely.
I know, it's all I can think about most days. Most of the time I'm self aware enough not to bore people. &amp;#x200B; Whoops.
Neural networks were a big hype in the 1990’s and then everyone forgot about them. They are conceptually not that difficult, it’s just that, until recently, computers were too slow to do more than a few “layers”. It turns out that with fast computers and lots of layers, the technique works *much* better, and is actually useful. So the hype machine is rolling again, and with it, a whole new jargon designed to impress the boss (and confuse newbies). As JohnHilter wrote, “deep learning” is just more layers in the neural net — it’s not a magical algorithm of metaphysical “understanding”. You might want to start by studying old textbooks on neural networks from 25 years ago. Same ideas, less BS.
git is definitely the MOST widely used method for collaboration and source control. I think the closest equivalent to a real time editing software (think google docs) would be [https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com/) &amp;#x200B; Colab is built on jupyter notes and is great for building reports as a group. I would not recommend using this as your primary collaboration method for large/complex projects.
Data camp and coursera
sqlite is embedded only so it is not built to be accessed remotely. You would have to be able to mount the filesystem onto your local machine to access the data. If more than one machine is allowed to access the database at one time, you will run into tons of issues. &amp;#x200B; I strongly recommend you look into other free database options like mysql or postgres. Both mysql and postgres work play nicely with python and flask and can be accessed remotely.
Do you have any recommendations for these older textbooks?
Treat it more like a markov event. If you are at the library, the probability of church should be zero..
Nah, it was interesting read. Sorry for my long reply as well. I hope I am not cluttering up r/Python. Do you mean to say that future events affect those in the past? Or, that the choices made by those in the future affect those made in the past? I do not see how that can be. There are two types of time-travel in science fiction. When someone time-travels to the past, either a new “branch” in time is created, or alternatively, they are not able to affect the past at all. An example of the former is the show [Continuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_(TV_series)), where IIRC the future is affected by the people who travelled to the past. An example of the latter is [12 Monkeys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_Monkeys) the movie, not the TV show. (The TV show did not hold firm to this idea.) In the movie, the people who travel to the past cannot change it, thus forming a closed loop where they always went to the past and always were part of it. It is shown that they have free will in their time, but follow fate in the past and past events cannot be changed. The problem with future events affecting the past is that, as the past affects the future, the future could affect the past such that the event that sent the message never happens. For example, if we heard that nuclear Armageddon happens next Tuesday due to false radar readings (channeling [WarGames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarGames) here), we would fix the faulty radar machine, making sure that it does not create the bad readouts. This would thereby eliminate the event that sent the “ripple”, which would eliminate the need for fixing the machine in the first place. Thus, the only ways around this paradox are the aforementioned ways. Either the past is immutable, a new future is created, or thirdly that backwards time-travel and ripples are not possible. This does not preclude forward time-travel, but it is mostly useless. Or, is there another way around this problem?
Yes this. This wasn’t “talking to”. More “was made to interact with because you decided to pipe in the bot”. Absolutely consider how your wording will impact users expectations.
I was trying to think of one, none were that special enough to remember.
on line 153, i think you missed the "\]" to close the brackets
I may not be seeing it, when are signups closing?
She's a keeper
It's not time travel. No object is going into the past, it makes the fabric ripple. That's my conclusions this far, but it's sort of like saying "apples are the best fruit"; perhaps I've not tasted a better fruit. In fact, I'm pretty confident that there is something just out of my reach, like a word slipping my tongue - that would explain the behaviors in a way that allowed for much greater insight.
The reason async is "the way to program" in JS is that JS simply doesn't have synchronous APIs for things - it was originally designed for the browser, a fundamentally async environment, and when Node came along, they went with what people were already familiar with (and bonus points for it working well for their originally intended use case, which is writing servers). Python is unlikely to go "async everywhere" at this point because async isn't actually _needed_ everywhere.
Maybe a [notebook](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support) would suit your needs?
You could start with svm, random forest, etc which require less data and are more straight forward
You can use Python Interactive Window. https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support
It's not needed everywhere, until you need it in your app, then it's needed like everywhere in your app
Not really? There's a lot of things you can still do synchronously, even in async code. People seem to have this idea that if you're using anything async, everything you use must be async, but that's not really the case.
Keras is a great tool for learning neural networks. I would recommend [this free online course from Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud187) (no credit card or anything needed). It is taught by some experts in google and goes through using Tensorflow with Keras. It is designed for software developers and goes through the code line by line. You can start making a neural network within a few hours. It is not very long but they will be adding more lessons to the course over the summer (such as running tensorflow on mobile/javascript applications). &amp;#x200B; If you want a more in depth look at how neural networks work, I recommend watching [this video series by 3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk) about neural networks. It really helps understand whats going on behind the scenes in Keras. The fourth video in the series is heavily math focused and while not necessary, it provides a lot of good information if you can follow it. &amp;#x200B; Hope this helps!
[pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) Some [functions](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/transform.html#pygame.transform.smoothscale) to help scale the surface(screen).
I'd be line if I said this wasn't cool
This is relevant to me as a python guy myself...
Excellent 😁 I'll add those features to the list for the next version!
When you have an IO-bound app, it seems to be the way to go all the time. But yes, if you have CPU intensive tasks, it is better to run separate processes/interpreters.
This might not be a popular opinion, but I really hope async/await never takes off. I just find the whole premise of it unpythonic. I think gevent is much closer to the right idea. Rather than pass the complexity of handling concurrency to the developer, have the runtime handle as much of the complexity as possible.
It's kinda true in a limited sense - calling async APIs from synchronous code is problematic (as is calling blocking synchronous code from async code, albeit to a lesser extent), so async-ness tends to propagate outwards, pushing you towards async-everywhere.
Can someone help me grasp this. I use Python only for data analysis and some automation.
When you write a function, class or method, the arguments to that function give you a clear signal that these arguments are all this piece of code needs. This makes a global an undocumented dependency. It makes the code harder to use correctly, because it can fail for reasons that are not obvious. It also makes the code harder to change. If you need to refactor the code, and you suspect other code may be relying on it, it's harder to understand what assumptions that other code is making about global variables.
Doing I/O things asynchronously can speed up programs by a lot. For data analysis it depends on the amounts of data you analyze but imagine you need to normalize your data or store large amounts somewhere in a DB then asynchronous libraries can boost your application a lot.
Good Job Man! looking forward to more progress videos from you.
Maybe r/creativecoding is a good place to ask.
If your program is made to be run with terminal tools available, I see no problem in using subprocess. If there is an python extension available I would use that. Read about the [trap of shell=True](https://medium.com/python-pandemonium/a-trap-of-shell-true-in-the-subprocess-module-6db7fc66cdfd)

One thing I've learned with coding is everything's sloppy until it's not. By sharing it the issues you came across may be fixed and the sloppiness may be cleaned up. That being said I'm not sure how many more Facebook sign bots we need and releasing this will almost certainly result in some
&gt; However I think there could be a more efficient way of doing that. I don't think efficiency is an important factor for surgical robots. They need to make accurate and precise decisions. Efficiency is the least of their concerns. Do you have sufficient amount of training data? You could train a CNN to localize the cut.
I hope not
I'd argue that Asyncio is a more full-featured and better-engineered version of gevent, TBH. The async/await syntax is a result of it being integrated into the standard library. We
Buy a book that covers the topic of neural networks/machine learning. I tried to watch a lot of videos but basically all of them are something like (in pseudocode): import machine_learning nn = machine_learning.Neural_network() nn.learn() and that is it. Now you know everything about machine learning. Also if you don't know much about Linear Algebra watch some videos about it (for example from MIT youtube).
No, unfortunately we don't have access to such kind of data. Also, could you please elaborate on how one can train a CNN like that?
Hmm I'm having some troubles with it for some reason. I'll try it again soon and let you know what error I'm getting.
I will thanks ^^
It's a cool idea, except there's no way to add such a logic to a chatbot modelling "generic conversation". How would it know that the words "church" and "library" are necessary mutually exclusive as locations? Also, these kind of models don't model causality well, but more association.

Garbage bot dude lol
Cheers man! I appreciate the encouragement 😀 What the kind of stuff are you working on?
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar
First, see my response to /u/james_pic; there's some good stuff in there. To my understanding, you're worried about async as a paradigm (feel like that could be its own acronym) overwhelming Python. There are two things working against this: 1) Pythonic Python devs are very weary of adding complexity, namely in the form of a convoluted dependency graph, to their apps. Unfortunately, not all Python devs are, as it were, Pythonic, but at least Guido is there to keep a semblance of order! JS, on the other hand, has a lot of devs who tend to prefer auto-magical solutions and a language extensible to everything from text editors (truly, Electron.js is a travesty) to application servers. What this has to do with Python and Asyncio is that people won't use it and take on the complexity unless they need to, in which case they'll do so gladly because Asyncio gives them well thought-out idioms to handle it and is therefore a joy to work with. 2) Asyncio is hard, and will force you to reason about your code in a completely different way. Most people will write their code, be halfway done, and decide "Hey, I'm a brilliant engineer who goes above and beyond! Maybe my boss will see my impact and give me a raise if I make this whole thing async!" Then, all hell breaks loose... in JS, which makes it easy to do this by turning everything into an auto-magical object manipulation. Fortunately, Asyncio doesn't take away the complexity like async/await syntax in JS sometimes does; in order for it to even pass the syntax checker, you have to completely rethink your workload and know exactly what you're using it for. That fact would cause the engineer in the previous situation to go after a few hours "fuck this, I'll just give them the features they asked me for!" From a programming languages perspective, JS is shot to shit. However, due to the facts that Guido and the core devs are awesome enough to even have a concept of "Pythonic," I still have hope for Python yet.
Some time ago I wrote [moviepy](https://github.com/Zulko/moviepy) (for videos), [gizeh](https://github.com/Zulko/giz) (for vector graphics, might be a bit difficult to install) and [vapory](https://github.com/Zulko/vapory) (for 3D) for generating procedural art. You can also combine them ([moviepy + gizeh](http://zulko.github.io/blog/2014/09/20/vector-animations-with-python/), [moviepy + vapory](http://zulko.github.io/blog/2014/11/13/things-you-can-do-with-python-and-pov-ray/)). You can also have a look [neozhaoliang](https://github.com/neozhaoliang/pywonderland) and [Michael Fogleman](https://github.com/fogleman) (mostly Go but some python) for inspiration.
You could also just open the built-in terminal and start python. I used to do this when I was starting, but since moved to writing my code in Jupyter Notebooks. You could also use the [ support for Jupyter Notebooks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support) and just run those lines as a cell. It is just three extra characters, so it would probably be the least extra work.

I just released a package a few days ago, and can confirm that `twine upload -s` works, at least for me. It takes as its argument a list of package files, and for each one generates a detached signature and uploads both package and signature. That said, package signing for PyPI is [not the panacea people often expect it to be](https://caremad.io/posts/2013/07/packaging-signing-not-holy-grail/).
&gt; That said, package signing for PyPI is not the panacea people often expect it to be. I've read that article, the points he has raised hasn't got anything to do with GPG design itself but implementation issues like thousands of devs pushing packages to PyPi and everyone can't be pushed to sign, etc. He even admits that debian, ubuntu, etc. already do it as they have a core and manageable team. It could be done with PyPi too, you just need to keep signing optional, that's all.

&gt; He even admits that debian, ubuntu, etc. already do it as they have a core and manageable team. It could be done with PyPi too, you just need to keep signing optional, that's all. This doesn't solve the problem, though. [Here](https://pypi.org/project/django-flashpolicies/) is a package I pushed up the other day to PyPI. Like everything I publish, it was uploaded with signatures. You can go grab them and verify that they are good signatures generated by a 4096-bit RSA key with id `0x2D9266A6808FE067`. And you can go to your favorite keyserver and pull that key and see it has a pretty good chain of trust on it (reaching into several reputable groups like Debian developers). So you have a high degree of confidence in *who* uploaded that package. But you gain absolutely no confidence that I am a person who *should be able to* upload that package. The Django project worked around this for a while by publishing a list of authorized release keys, with the chicken-and-egg problem that the list itself had to be signed by an authorized key, but we don't bother with that anymore. We don't cross-sign all the releasers' keys anymore, either. Basically, you can have a free-for-all "anybody can claim some namespace and publish" like PyPI, or you can have a tightly curated ecosystem with very few authorized packagers like Debian, but you can't have both, and to get what you seem to want, you'd need to have both. Also, I'm currently on twine 1.13.0. I have a virtualenv with the packaging toolchain installed, and my first step whenever I'm ready to release something is to run a `pip install --upgrade pip setuptools twine wheel`, so I should always be on or very close to latest.
May I suggest a feature? Instead of putting the dotfiles into the home directory, download them into a hidden folder (where a git repository may be kept) and symlink them to their appropriate places.
&gt; if 3D data capture is even possible (I doubt it) for a compound microscope I have no idea. :) Some naive Google searches find: * [A beginners' guide to practical pitfalls in image acquisition](http://jcb.rupress.org/content/172/1/9#sec-7) suggests "Standard compound or “wide-field” microscopes ... can provide clear lateral (x- and y-axis) information but only limited axial (z-axis) information". * [Confocal Microscopy, Deconvolution (PDF)](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4d46/2a4aea44fa9a173455fb71fa4745caa14895.pdf), [Deconvolution with Python &amp; OpenCV](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20266825/deconvolution-with-opencv/42612734) might be interesting? * [3D Measurement Methods](https://www.swissphotonics.net/libraries.files/Zuest_3D_Messtechnik_50_years_SSOM_2010.pdf) mentions Stereoscopic 3D Reconstruction from two images (left and right) and more. Probably also [possible in OpenVC](https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_calib3d/py_depthmap/py_depthmap.html#py-depthmap)?
&gt; millions of dollars Supposedly a [OpenSPIM](https://openspim.org/Table_of_parts) 3D acquisition microscope can be built for under 10'000 dollars. But it still seems much too expensive &amp; complicated for a hobby-level attempt. :)
What do you mean by "learn Python", exactly? Learn enough to write simple programs? Sure. Learn enough to get a job? Extremely unlikely.
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar
Learn enough to be able to earn, How much time does it take to learn enough to be able to earn?
There is no universal number I can give you, but it's definitely more than a month, and likely more than a few months for a job above intern level.
The thing that helped me the most was looking into the QT C++ documentation. It's incredibly complete and with a bit of imagination, translates really well to python :) Also, look into PySide2. It's the "official" implementation of QT in Python, with a better license.
Thanks for your answer. I'll definitely lookup to this.
convert to datetime, get the hour of day, put into a bucket
Sorry, no. You can learn a fair bit of python syntax in a month, but programming is more than just syntax. If you have other marketable skills (e.g. proven experience in a technical field), then learning programing will be attractive to potential employers. But it is highly unlikely that you'll be able to go from completely unskilled to full-fledged developer in a matter of weeks. A lot of people think of programming as easy money - like a get-rich-quick scheme - but that isn't what it is.
You are thinking about building sky-scrapers when not even a tar-road exists! Verifying the package's *integrity* and author's *identity* are two different problems, at least let GPG solve the integrity problem first! &gt; Basically, you can have a free-for-all "anybody can claim some namespace and publish" like PyPI, or you can have a tightly curated ecosystem with very few authorized packagers like Debian, but you can't have both, and to get what you seem to want, you'd need to have both. &gt; You can actually have both by dividing the PyPi into two separate repos called `core` and `community` (or something along those lines). Ubuntu has a similar thing, they call it the `core` and `contrib` repos. `core` has all the main curated stuff like linux kernel, git, etc. whereas the `contrib` has what they call non-free (and other software they don't put a lot of trust in). PyPi can also keep signing optional in the community repo and mandatory in the core repo just to keep it more secure. These are just my 10 cents.
Thanks for the suggestion :) I'm adding a TODO item for this.
Sure, thanks :)
Lol, years? Learning a syntax is easy, what takes time is learning “computer science”: code architecture, algorithms, networks and stuff If you want to earn money as a programmer in a company then you’d better take some CS degree.. If you want to be some kind of freelance “I’ll make your website” stuff then you can do on your own with some patience If you want to go the zuckenberg style, then all you need is a good idea.. but I can’t see zuckenberg going on learnphp asking how long does it take to get rich
Sloppy or not can u please put your code up for the rest of us?
Turtle
PGP is not a requirement to verify integrity. You can verify that with a hash algorithm, and `pip` already supports a hash-checking mode. And I don't see how your "core" and "community" solve anything; who decides what goes where? How do you get any benefit out of it if the packages you care about aren't in "core"? And why wouldn't "core" just be the Python standard library at that point?
Of course you use Arch, after the fifth install you loose interest in installing everything by hand and wish there were a nice automatic script \^\^ (at least that is what happened to me). Nice btw, I have something similar but way less flexible.
I wouldn't trust a neural network to wash my dishes, let alone perform surgery.
thx :D
The hash-checking has a limitation in that it involves trust on a single entity (PyPi). If PyPi server got compromised in future, then we are all doomed. With GPG signing, the trust involves both PyPi and the developers. Even if the server gets compromised, they won't be able to do anything as only the original author can create a matching signature for the package. The Python community decides what goes where. The reputed projects like flask, django, nltk, etc. can go in the core as the community can pretty much establish their author's credentials. The less reputed ones can go in the community, it will be just like any other decision that Python project usually takes. If the package I care about isn't in the core, I'll simply [add its repository as described here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/hosting-your-own-index/). However, its better to have the community repo included by default too in the pip client just with a brief message like "these packages aren't trusted by the community and their verification is the sole responsibility of the user" or something like that. Turning the "core" repo into standard library is an even better idea, but one step at a time!

Lmao this is more accurate than JavaScript's Floating Point calculations.
You could look at fastai course by jeremy howard, currently enrolled in it.. complex topics explained very simply
&gt; The hash-checking has a limitation in that it involves trust on a single entity (PyPi). If PyPi server got compromised in future, then we are all doomed. The idea behind the hash-checking mode is that you perform whatever verification you care about on the versions of the packages you intend to use, and note their hashes. Then you feed those to `pip` and it compares to what comes from PyPI; if there's a mismatch, it bails out with an error. If you're going to cut corners and just trust whatever hash comes off PyPI without verifying up-front, PGP won't save you because you'll cut corners on that too and just trust a signature from any key someone serves up. &gt; The Python community decides what goes where. The reputed projects like flask, django, nltk, pandas, etc. can go in the core as the community can pretty much establish their author's credentials. Can the community really do that? I mean, sure, you can verify that a particular Django package was signed by a particular key. But can you verify that the person who owns that key really was authorized to make that package? I can verify that, but you can't, or rather you can't to the degree you seem to think you can. And this whole comment chain is really just proving the truth of the article I linked at the beginning: "support package signing" is not the panacea people think it is, because what they forget about is the whole massive investment in building and maintaining a web of trust and lists of authorized keys and other infrastructure that's necessary to make signing useful. Which is why you're having to propose a complete fundamental overhaul of how PyPI works; if "just support package signing" was the magical solution people like to think it is, you wouldn't need to go on about setting up a trusted "PyPI core" and all these other things.
Google "stitched cuts". With that, you can label a huge dataset because stitches are a different color than skin and the cut, so you'd only really need to label some images of stitched cuts yourself in order to generate some useful data. The algorithm would quickly learn that the coordinates you want occur perpendicular and intersecting with the only black lines in the image shaped like railroad tracks, or stitches. Slap some transfer learning on there, badda bing badda boom you have a great dataset with fairly accurate coordinates on where the cut is around even reading images of cuts without the stitches.

Self taught? At least a year, and that is with a very focused and rigorous learning path you set yourself. The hardest part will be figuring our what you want to do. There's no such thing as "python work". Do you want to work in data analytics/engineering? Do you want to work in web dev? Do you want to be a systems / network engineer? Unless you know a very specific path you want to take, you'll pretty much be wasting your time, and you'd be better suited to go to college for a bachelor's in comp sci. Otherwise forget it.
Here's some code that reads a CSV file, converting date strings to date times and then creates 10 minute "buckets" of counts. &amp;#x200B; `pd.options.display.float_format = '{:,.0f}'.format` `_data = pd.read_csv(_file, names=['timestamp', 'country', 'service', 'code', 'num1', 'num2', 'host'],` `parse_dates=['timestamp'], date_parser=date_parser, index_col=['timestamp'])` `# log.debug(_data.head())` `_periods = _data.groupby([pd.Grouper(freq='600s'), 'country', 'service', 'code'])` `# log.debug(_periods.head())` `_buckets = _periods['code'].count().unstack('timestamp').fillna(0)`
Two, actually. Would not have caught that.
Source code?
The article forgot to mention an important detail, which is that a lot of the libraries (numpy, tensorflow, etc.) used in ML and Python in general, are actually a wrapper for the C library that is really doing the computation. So typically you still have to install the C code for the python code to work, but pip and conda eliminate most of the problems with that. The main reason, therefore, that Python is used over C is that Python is typically cleaner and easier to use, which means as long as you keep the heavy lifting inside the C libraries then your code will be both intuitive as Python but almost as fast as C.
If you want to understand neural nets rather than just learn how to apply a keras model to a problem, try this. The code snippets are in js but it's easy to see what's happening. It will show you how to build your own small network from scratch and without dependencies. Libraries like keras will then make much more sense. https://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/

This was a fun comment to read. It's rare to see so much effort put in and I very much agree that fractals are incredible! How much physics and mathematics have you studied? I ask because (don't take this the wrong way) while you're clearly very passionate, it's also very clear you don't have a deep understanding of what you're talking about. That description exactly fits a promising student, if you ask me. I have a long background in physics, mathematics, and engineering and I'd like to give you some feedback. Mostly because I suspect you haven't had much feedback from people like me on this subject. First off, the tone. Perhaps it's a failure of the larger scientific community, but when people boast their ambitious theories as fact, many scientists get pissed off and basically shut down. Imagine being an astrophysicist and you're stuck sitting know with someone just simply knows the earth is flat. Infuriating to many, I'd say. Using less certain language not only could make people more likely to engage with your ideas, but would allow them to engage without telling you you're outright incorrect. Second, I see you collecting bits of information from here and there, weaving them together into a greater theory. Is this fun? Oh yeah. Is this useful? Hell no. In fact, it's pretty detrimental to productive conversations. Mostly because by stringing these unrelated ideas together and alluding to some sort of greater structure, you clearly demonstrate your lack of knowledge in all of the included subjects. As a very quick example, you discussed geometric fractals as a key point in your greater theory. But what about other kinds of fractals? Compare the Sierpinski Triangle to a Julia Set. Both fractals, but entirely different in their structure and formation. What property about a geometric fractal is relevant to your theory and, if that factor isn't missing from other types of fractals, how do those fit in?
Here's my best paraphrasing of the article: "Python is best because it has the most powerful tools. I could list them all and compare them to the ones available in C++ and Java because I did A LOT of research on it for this article, but I don't have time. In summary C++ is not versatile, and Java is just too slow. "
Are you secretly the backdrop designer for Tool's latest tour?
If you try adding a bunch of other python libraries to an environment it dies in a fire. Or at least that was my experience. That's all they've really changed here I think
http://arcade.academy/examples/drawing_primitives.html Some pretty good docs with examples.

Is this the beginning of a WIP black mirror episode?
Conda is the shittiest thing I have ever tried,
Do you have an example ? I usually don't have issues
For real though, this is next-level laziness and generally counterproductive. How hard is it to press CTRL+S? For quick viability tests, use the python interactive console. When writing a program, save the damned thing to disk and run it from there. It takes literally 10 seconds. The python interpreter *reads the program from a file*, so you kinda need a file to have a program. This question amounts to "How can I run a program without writing a program?" In this case, I suggest waiting for [this requested feature in Python 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/bpxrh0/comment/enz94pn).
It's called *layer engineering*. Its been a thing since Henry Ford figure out how to keep the line moving even if Billy Joe Bob drops his tool. You should be able to rip an entire layer out, service it, then reimplement, all without the system skipping a beat. Rule of thumb, you never cross layers.
It's pretty anecdotal and hard to tell if it was my computer. I was using it on an older computer without a ssd. I was managing maybe four environments at the time and swapping between them took somewhere in the scale of minutes. Conda would go completely unresponsive. Ended up switching to VS Code to try it and didn't have any of the same issues swapping between environments.
It's easier to write fiction than it is to find actual physical truths of the universe. The one article he linked shows that it's a bunch of nonsense.
All of those things Python "can do" is actually just C/C++ with a thin layer of Python on top to make it more usable. My guess w.r.t. PHP would be either that it has a worse foreign function interface, or simply that no one has put in the work to make those things possible in it yet.
Do you mean using ``activate`` or using ipython/notebook with different envs?
Damn I learned a lot from this comment. Thanks.
&gt;complete beginner Do you know Python extensively? Can you tell me what a class is right now without googling? Can you implement a class called 'car' and instantiate two instances of it with one called Honda and one called Ford? If not you will find yourself constantly stumbling around in the world of neural networks.
I was using the environment manager in the Anaconda Navigator to be specific, then using Jupyter or Spyder for editing my code. The lag occurred when switching the environment in the Navigator. Once the environment was swapped successfully, the software was once again very responsive launching Spyder or Jupyter.
In most IDEs, saving files is zero effort because the editor just saves your changes constantly. I have never once in my career thought "fuck, I didn't want that to be saved!": and if I did, many IDEs keep track of your local history. The "experiment and rollback" workflow should be handled by your version control system (e.g. git), not by saving to disk. VScode has an autosave setting; I recommend switching it on. If you think autosaving will hurt your workflow, I recommend changing your workflow.
Because people have already built libraries to do it in Python, and have not built libraries to do it in PHP.
Learn how neural networks work first. For the most part, actual knowledge of python comes secondary to the necessary theory for neural networks. Figure out the tools after

I like this. The syntax he suggests also has parallelism with import, and I like the conceptual similarity between the two.
hmm that's weird, I use miniconda so I'm not familiar with the Navigator, I usually launch envs from the prompt so I'm always sure which is which but the lag between envs shouldn't happen anyway. The times I broke my install were : 1) Because I installed packages with conflicting versions of Python so that was my fault. 2) I had some weird issue about the C++ compiler not working with some libraries, on Windows.
If someone feels that strongly about PHP, go for it. So far, ive not met that person. Everyone loves Python though.
I totally agree. Took me a lot of trial and error to understand classes because of it 😑

What if we had one day of the week where a sticky post is created for questions/learning only. *Friday Question Thread -date here-* People can still use /r/learnpython and if they are still struggling and want more in depth or better answers, they can post whatever in the weekly question thread.

People can post any questions they want throughout the week, it's all contained within one stickied post, and people can always sort by new to see the fresh questions later in the week.
I'd like to unpack the "contempt" a little bit. I think PHP is super cool for what it was intended to do, but I personally dislike it for a lot of reasons, I'm trying to not let that color my thoughts here. The primary points to note for OCR/STT/ML are those packages are frequently not Python native but Python has a nice interface to them. Moreover for a lot of other non-webpage-building projects, you're going to want high quality and nice to interface with 3rd party code, which Python has a lot more of than PHP and for a much larger variety of tasks. The tooling around interfacing with 3rd party stuff is also a lot nicer for Python. Can you do anything in PHP anyway? Sure, but it won't be as fun or easy as taking advantage of what the Python community already has to offer. And then, this might be more contentious, PHP as a language to do much more than building a webpage is kind of silly. On second thought, I don't want to get into it now it's giving me a headache just thinking about how my team uses it.
oh god oooohhhhhghhehs
I don't see why it can't be changed now while still supporting the old style for backward compatibility or even make a super simple script that would let u migrate your project to the new style. A similar syntax change was done to try/except in python
Python has become a buzzword worth swinging out everywhere, just like machine learning has. Don't get me wrong, Python is the only thing I have really enjoyed programming in, and I took a simple machine learning cause just to get the gist.
It's way too late to change this.
Perl can do all those things too — but it’s also fading away like PHP. Just drink the kool-aid and you will understand — Python makes complicated things much easier. It was designed from the *beginning* to be powerful, clean, and maintainable. PHP was created to make it easy to create a “Personal Home Page”. Perl was created to bring some order to the chaos of shell scripting.
The main problem is the benefit is small (if there is any), and for a while, you would have two ways of specifying classes, which is much more confusing than just having one way.
Is it possible to learn this power?
You should add some kind of safe word, for when she actually needs to talk to you.

Don't start with Keras I would start with more generic machine learning and then work up to deep learning/anns. E.g., the book Python Machine Learning by wei-meng lee is really good, and then follow that up by Chollet's book on Deep learning in Python.
Aww so experiment failed :( That’s good though. Now you can make it proper.
It's throwing errors again... &amp;#x200B; &gt; HTTPError: 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://euw1.api.riotgames.com/lol/champion-mastery/v4/champion-masteries/by-summoner/.....
I agree. Starting with Keras/deep learning is a mistake. Like starting math by learning calculus. You should start with add/subtract/multiply/divide.
I agree this would make sense. I know this is super controversial, but I also think `self` shouldn't have to be an explicit argument for methods, and should be a magic variable like `this` in several other OOP languages. Some people say that it'd be too magical, but * It's always pure boilerplate (except when writing class methods with `@classmethod`; it could just make `cls` magical in the same way, for consistency) and never serves any purpose but to trip up developers who accidentally forget it. It's usually easy to spot and fix, but it's still just a needless annoyance. * Every other language makes the argument implicit. I don't think Python should have the implicit `this` variable scope Java has (where you can refer to an instance variable within a method without using `this`, e.g. `this.a` can be interchangeable with `a`), since that can reduce clarity, but I see no downside to removing the argument requirement. * For those who think it's too magical, Python 3 already made the `super()` method magical by grabbing the class and `self` objects implicitly, like how Java and other languages do it. Considering that's already a case of some hijinks being used to access `self` without the `self` argument actually being passed, I don't think removing the parameter from method signatures is a big leap. * One issue is it may break existing code beyond just requiring everyone to edit their method signatures and remove it. `self` isn't a special name, so any code that was using a different variable name would need further modification. So, this would probably either need to be implemented in some backwards-incompatible Python 4, or maybe could be used in Python 3 with "new-new style" classes which could be configured using a `__future__` import or a class decorator in the same vein as `@dataclass`.
&gt;it's giving me a headache just thinking about how my team uses it. Ah yes, I too have been in a "php as a systems programming" shop

I would recommend that you just write a neural network by hand before venturing into other packages. Fair warning, I'm not an educator so I can't say if this is the best approach but it is what worked for me.
So obviously you need an 10x20 array type structure. I would also give each number a unique id. And that id gets filled into the array. If there is any overlap or impossibility to finish, then you have a failure. &amp;#x200B; The first thing I would try is brute force since it is easier, it is fun and it gives you an overall sense of difficulty. &amp;#x200B; To add some intelligence think about where you have the most constraints that work to your advantage. This would be the corners. and then the sides. so an algorithm would want to attack those first.
The link is broken
"from" syntax is more verbose and doesn't provide any extra value. Anyone who has ever done any OOP understands what class A(B) means. It has also nothing to do with import, both classes need to be defined before use.
I beg to differ. I don't hit CTRL-S to save while using IntelliJ apps, Sublime Text or VSCode. I always setup auto-save. For VSCode use "files.autoSave" you can set it to delay save or on focus lost.
&gt;I know this is super controversial, but I also think self shouldn't have to be an explicit argument for methods, and should be a magic variable like this is in several other OOP languages. Some people say that it'd be too magical, but &amp;#x200B; absolutely not. The reason is that when I see a call in a method in C++ I have no idea what it's calling. Is it calling a function? or a method of the same class? or a method of a base class? forcing self at least hints you that the entity is not a free function. &amp;#x200B; &gt;It's always pure boilerplate (except when writing class methods with @classmethod; cls could just be made magical in the same way, for consistency) and never serves any purpose but to trip up developers who accidentally forget it &amp;#x200B; If you accidentally forget it, you are not a python programmer. &amp;#x200B; &gt;self isn't a special name, so any code that was using a different variable name would need further modification. So, this would probably either need to be implemented in some backwards-incompatible Python 4, or maybe could be used in Python 3 with "new-new style" classes which could be configured using a \_\_future\_\_ import or a class decorator in the same vein as @dataclass. &amp;#x200B; The day when python dumps implicit self is the day I change language.
&gt;Every other language makes the argument implicit. It's explicit in Rust.
&gt; Perl was created to bring some order to the chaos of shell scripting. &amp;#x200B; The joke here is that it created even more chaos.
OOP with python is completely counterintuitive. For example: all objects should know their own length. But in Python you have to call a built-in function to get this information. I know about the __length__, but is not an answer for my question :))
Keras isn't a competing deep learning framework. It's a high-level API which can use different frameworks as backends; I believe TensorFlow is the most popular and recommended backend. You can sort of think of Keras as `requests` and TensorFlow as `httplib` and `urllib3`. `requests` presents a nice, clean, simple, consistent, human-readable/writable, and fairly terse API layer on top of those two lower-level HTTP libraries. Or like how Beautiful Soup provides a nice high-level API for different backends like `html.parser`, `html5lib`, and `lxml`. Or Flask and Werkzeug. I'm brand new to ML and Keras/TensorFlow, but from what I can tell so far, there's no reason not to use Keras (with TensorFlow) wherever you can, especially as a beginner and especially if you're not doing research or experimenting with atypical neural network architectures. Keras is also now directly integrated into TensorFlow (`import tensorflow.keras`), and the creator of Keras was hired by Google and works on the TensorFlow team, so it's probably the best combination.
Using WSL since 2016. I am not a professional coder. I mainly use python for a some crawling, data processing, and flask work. Although installing lxml gave me a hard time, most of time it works fine (pip3 install did all the job). I even run vagrant and docker inside WSL. I use Notepad++ and vim, but sometimes I am thinking maybe I should use an IDE?
Because \[PHP is a fractal of bad design\]([https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/](https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/)) and like microsoft, internet explorer, perl, and corba, it is responsible for grinding some aspects of internet innovation to a halt for years due to the technical tragedy they represented. PHP had a good initial step replacing CGI and SSI initially, but then they fucked up by wanting to be kinda like C kinda like bash, having an inconsistent, messy standard library, putting emphasis on a very bad programming style, using uncommon syntax for some thing, and producing idiotic and frequently seen error messages in rarely seen foreign languages. &amp;#x200B; It lived too long already.

Python 4 is right round the corner! /s
Thanks, fixed.
&gt;I know this is super controversial, but I also think self shouldn't have to be an explicit argument for methods, Bad idea. What happens if you do this: \`\`\` def f(self, x): pass &amp;#x200B; class C: pass C.f = f \`\`\` &amp;#x200B; Now, you have to have \`self\` as an explicit argument and it would no longer agree with the method definitions on the class.
&gt;For example: all objects should know their own length. That's a bold assertion. What about objects representing a stream of data coming over a wire? What about objects whose literal length doesn't represent their "functional" length (like compressed arrays)? What about generators?
You could do almost anything in PHP. But that said you could do everything in FORTRAN too. PHP has its place, and its the backing language of wordpress, for anything else theres a better tool for the job. Just like you dont use fortran for scripting, you dont use PHP for ML.
&gt; absolutely not. The reason is that when I see a call in a method in C++ I have no idea what it's calling. Is it calling a function? or a method of the same class? or a method of a base class? In Python, if you're defining a method in a class body, with no decorator, it's always an instance method. There's no ambiguity or room for confusion. And you'd still need to say `self.method("text")` if want to call an instance method from another method. I'm just suggesting that the method's signature be `def method(text)` rather than `def method(self, text)`. &gt;If you accidentally forget it, you are not a python programmer. If you accidentally forget a semicolon in C++, you are not a C++ programmer.
Wow, that's a great idea--it would have helped a lot during the initial OOP learning process. Thanks for sharing!
&gt;absolutely not. The reason is that when I see a call in a method in C++ I have no idea what it's calling. Is it calling a function? or a method of the same class? or a method of a base class? &gt; &gt;forcing self at least hints you that the entity is not a free function. I guess I feel like if it's a static method or "free function", why should it be part of a class definition at all? There really isn't any point to this, is there? It seems like class definitions are necessary if the class is going to be instantiated as an object and has some internal state - otherwise, why use classes at all? And if you are using classes in this manner, as they are used in every other OOP language that leans heavily on an OOP paradigm, then there's nothing confusing about self being implicit because every method in a class definition has it and every method outside of a class definition doesn't - so you just need to look at where the method is defined. I guess I just don't understand why you would ever want statically callable methods inside of a class definition.

There are 31 numbers so there will be 31 rectangles, each defined by 4 coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2) and there are constraints for the coordinates (the rectangle must contain the number, rectangles must not overlap, rectangle dimensions depend on the number) so maybe this can be solved with a library like [python-constraints](https://github.com/python-constraint/python-constraint) or [NumberJack](https://github.com/eomahony/Numberjack).

Python has always had a reputation for having more elegant and well designed core language features and PHP has always had a reputation for being wonky and broken. However, I don't think that's an explanation for why PHP is very popular but almost exclusively for web development whereas Python is heavily used in many different types of software. PHP was started as a project for web development and that has always been the main focus. Because of that, it does not have many of the general purpose features outside of the language itself that Python has. What probably helped Python the most in terms of being able to do things like OCR and machine learning is that it has a long history of being able to interact directly with C/C++ libraries. Especially early-on, almost all of the libraries for doing things like image processing or machine learning were written in C/C++, so often the choices as a developer using those libraries was to use C/C++ yourself (which has less benefits for someone using a computationally intensive library than someone writing that library) or use Python bindings. Since C/C++ never really caught on for web development in any context, PHP never had a reason to add good standard library support for directly interacting with low level native code. Along with that, Python has steadily built a series of more and more sophisticated package managers over the years for organizing and using third party libraries. When using something OpenCV for computer vision tasks, traditionally you would have to figure out how to install OpenCV on your operating system (possibly compiling it yourself), then make sure the C++ libraries were setup correctly to be linked from your Python environment, then manually download and install the Python library for OpenCV (making sure it's compatible with the version you have installed), then import and use OpenCV from your Python code and hope it all works correctly, possibly figuring out what the odd error messages mean when it didn't work. Various parts of that process have been automated over the years so that now on most operating systems you can just run "pip install opencv-python" and it will do everything in one shot, including installing the appropriate OpenCV binaries specific to your system. This makes it extremely simple to use open source software in Python, so often compared to other general-purpose languages Python is the easiest to use.

It keeps me up at night and is a massive demotivator. I thought I was doing good making a robust system and best practices docs too switch us over to sanity, but alas "good enough" prevails
Yeah, I'm using the Code Runner extension, mapped running code to F5 and have the following entry in my settings: "code-runner.saveFileBeforeRun": true,
Why would you ever put a method in a class definition in Python that is meant to be called statically as a “free function” and not by an instance of the class? What’s the point of this? Why not just define it outside of the class?
True, this is one serious issue with it. I suppose one possible resolution would be to use something like Ruby's "open classes" system, so that you could define `class C` in one place and then add the `f` method like this: ``` class C: pass # more code class C: def f(x): pass ``` This would be overhauling the entire object system, though. A compromise could be to just make a new decorator, like `@dataclass`, for top-level functions expected to be used as instance methods. `self` would still always be passed as the first argument instance methods under the hood (this is what languages like Java do despite the argument not being needed in the method signature). ``` @instancemethod def f(x): pass class C: pass C.f = f c_instance = C() c_instance.f(x) # this will still be converted to C.f(c_instance, f) f(c_instance, x) # this does the same thing, just as it currently does in Python with an explicit self ```
Ah yes, they will welcome you and induct you into their world.
You may be looking for the "Python Image Library" (PIL), now called "pillow", which lets you create an image of any size and type, and "draw" on it with a pretty wide variety of primitives including individual pixels, lines, arc, rectangles, ovals, polygons, other images, etc. With pillow, there are virtually no limitations on the content of the images you can create, only the limits of your own code and imagination.
🙏 even people who release python are not so stringent . Thanks for letting know anyway
If they have, they should know. obg.length() is far clearer then len(obj)
&gt;so that you could define &gt; &gt;class C in one place and then add the method like this: yeah, but you might not want to just add \`f\` to \`C\`. You might use it as a function in other places. &amp;#x200B; You're just making something simple much more complicated. \`self\` is just an ordinary positional parameter. Nothing more.
you don't understand. the free function is not defined on the class. it's defined at the module level. but you can still call it from within the methods of the class. However, if you remove the self requisite, now you don't know if within the method you are calling a free function or another method of the same class.
I do actually agree that methods (which are easier to specify an interface for) are a better idea than free functions, especially when those free functions just call bound methods anyway. I don't really understand the reasoning behind that extra level of redirection.
&gt;yeah, but you might not want to just add f to C. You might use it as a function in other places. There would be no change to how this works. In both the current system and the proposed new system, you'd still always have to call the function as `f(some_instance, x)` if it's not an attribute of a class. `self` is still the ordinary first positional argument passed to it. The only difference is the method signature. Also, in practice, I think most people are probably going to be attaching it to classes and calling it from the instance. But even if they don't, it still works exactly the same, other than the `@instancemethod` decorator.
Python is becoming more and more popular because it's one of the best (if not THE best) scripting languages around, has a huge amount of community support (and free 3rd party modules available), and it's installed by default on pretty much every OS other than Windows (and even Windows will start including it in a future update IIRC). So you have a language that's easy to use, has libraries available to do pretty much anything you can imagine, is freely available and installed by default just about everywhere... it's not hard to see why it's become so popular.
One way to start would be to create a list of possible rectangles that could fit around each number. For example, the 6 in the lower left corner has just two possibilities, and the 8 near the lower right corner has only one option! The lower 4 on the right edge has two possible solutions, but since you already know where the rectangle for the 8 must go, that leaves only one possibility for the 4. At each stage, as you fill in more of the puzzle, the range of possibilities for the remaining numbers will be reduced. It may work out like a Sudoku puzzle, where there is only one solution, and you don't have to "search" for the answer at all. A few years ago I wrote a Sudoku solver, followed by a Sudoku puzzle creator, followed by a program to measure how "hard" a particular Sudoku puzzle was based on the number of different paths forward at each point. In the end I was able to generate Sudoku puzzles with a specified level of difficulty. A similar thing could be done with this type of puzzle. For example, you could deliberately create puzzles of this type that are hard to solve.
I'm not sure I understand exactly what you mean. Could you please show a code example to demonstrate? Assuming you're in the body of an instance method, like so: ``` class C: def calculate(): # code here ``` If you're calling a regular, free, top-level module function, you're still going to call it like `method(x)`. If you're calling a regular, free, top-level module function which accepts a `self` first argument (or, in my proposal, has an `@instancemethod` decorator), you're still going to call it like `method(self, x)`. If you're calling a method of the same class (e.g. defined in the class body, or defined top-level and added as an attribute to the class), you're still going to call it like `self.method(x)`. There would be no change in the calling convention between the current system and this one. Just the method signatures.
There’s very little overlap between those 3 languages. If Python is growing it means it is finding a new niche, instead of getting programmers from Java or C user base.
And it is stupidly simple! I understand its popularity, no doubt about it. Dealing with Python on Windows is actually not that bad using Anaconda tbh. Getting the Python path to have you editor run the script directly and having the path for your custom modules is (in my opinion at least). Whether this is vastly different in other languages I can't really say.
So if it's so obvious that this is the way to go, why a new project? Why not just change conda to include the faster solver? &amp;#x200B; Conda \*is\* super slow, I agree, and it's untenable, the project will not survive if it is not made faster. But a separate project seems unnecessary given conda is open source and accepting patches. I wonder if there was an attempt to patch conda before essentially forking it? Were the developers not happy to accept patches? Is there some unacceptable break in backwards compatibility? Is there a requirement that conda be pure Python?
Ok, but you still have to define \_\_init__ to have an actual argument signature for creating the object. Besides, classes arent functions in and of themselves; they are data containers with methods designed to act against that data. I get where he's coming from but it's not really an issue IMO.
Neural Computing (1990) by Russell Beale and T Jackson is a good candidate
This is all anectodal, but I noticed the slowdown I think ever since pipenv came out and started this notion of dependency "locking" with its pipfile format. Then Anaconda folks followed suit and implemented their way of dependency locking with the conda command. Before all of this, installing packages was fairly quick.
Having it as an explicit argument allows for any old function - and therefore, also dynamically created functions - to become methods. Decorators are the most obvious example. Say you make a decorator, which takes in a function, and returns a new function. How is that new function going to access self, and how is it going to provide self to the wrapped function? Recall that self is not in the arguments, you're not in a class when you write the decorator, and the decorators should work for both methods and non-methods. Basically, if you make self magic, then methods and functions now work differently. That may be fine in a static language, but in a dynamic language it goes wrong fast. Just look at the mess of `this` in Javascript.
sounds a lot like gatekeeping to me.
Things this doesn't address that the class definition line does: specifying a metaclass and passing arguments to `__init_subclass__`. They aren't needed for every class, but they'd need to go somewhere and I don't see an obvious way to incorporate them with this syntax.
That depends on what you're testing and how you're testing it. Most of the time, Python is _fast enough_.

As has already been pointed out in other comments, there is the issue of 'self' potentially not always being the variable's name. Also, what if other parameters are named 'self' instead? I hope that this is very rarely the case, as it would be terribly confusing to work with such code, but if there are cases of this, it could be a bit more difficult that just a simple find-and-replace script.
I certainly agree that the need for good concurrency primitives is what has driven this. I think it's ultimately point 1 that made something gevent-like unworkable (it would have meant drastic changes to the C API, and there's too much existing code that leverages the Python C API to do that), but I still think it's unfortunate. The async/await keywords feel to me like implementation details of the runtime surfacing to ambush the programmer, in a way that Python has historically worked hard not to do (like how Python never forced programmers to manually manage memory). I can't help but be envious of languages like Golang, Ruby and Erlang, that tackled this early enough that they didn't have to worry about backwards compatibility when they introduced lightweight concurrency primitives, and managed to avoid the "[What color is your function](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/)" problem that async/await introduces, that's been the hallmark of late-adoption of concurrency primitives.
I don't understand how so many people here seem to agree that introducing an alternative syntax would be beneficial. This post is about a fundamentally superficial, purely cosmetic syntactic change. There's no added value whatsoever. If you're learning OOP you need to understand the concept of inheritance, whether you're learning it with this alternative syntax or not makes no difference. I'm sorry but this post is purely a matter of personal preference, and therefore completely pointless.
One thing to try is seeing how many RPS you get when performing more than one request at a time to the server, you should see that Go's built in concurrency handling provides higher throughput. Also try with a non trivial benchmark as there's not much room to be different when echoing a string back to the caller. Perhaps try sending a file from a ramdisk, as Go shines when you have lots of concurrent blocking IO. Having used both daily the concurrency handling of Go makes it easier to do things at the same time or when sharing memory between requests. Try broadcasting events or incrementing a shared counter. Just look at the file based hacky workarounds for Prometheus in multiprocessing mode to see what I mean https://github.com/prometheus/client_python/blob/master/README.md#multiprocess-mode-gunicorn
CTRL + SHIFT + P and the “change language mode” lets you switch to your language of choice without saving the file
Why not use pycharm? You’ll get an interactive console when you run scripts. With sublime you’ll have to run scripts from a terminal if it requires input. Though sublime is easier to use / setup
The import statement works completely differently. Inherited classes are evaluated expressions, imported symbols are just names. Highly misleading.

Fair enough.
I just recently set up one on my laptop to use Ubuntu which makes things a little bit easier You can download VirtualBox to separate your normal PC vs your test environment Here is a guide https://brb.nci.nih.gov/seqtools/installUbuntu.html This may be more difficult in your work environment though because you may need to work with someone in IT to give you the appropriate rights to download and install everything
I understand that. The point is that I like that the code for definitions of \`f\` and \`g\` are identical.

&gt;How is that new function going to access self, and how is it going to provide self to the wrapped function? I proposed a new decorator `@instancemethod` which will allow any module-level function (function, not method) to be used as a method [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/bywo87/why_python_class_syntax_should_be_different/eqnp08m/). This would basically just wrap it with a function that takes a `self` parameter and then the rest of the positional and keyword arguments. Under the hood, instance methods defined in class bodies would essentially implicitly all be decorated with `@instancemethod` (unless of course they're decorated with `@classmethod` or `@staticmethod`). I believe this is not unlike how some other languages do it. So calling methods and functions would still be identical. It would look the same, and work the same internally. The only difference would be how you define methods. Method signatures for methods in class bodies just wouldn't have `self` as the first argument anymore, and top-level functions intended to be used as instance methods wouldn't have it either, but would additionally require the `@instancemethod` decorator. Defining instance methods as top-level functions with `self` arguments, to be dynamically added as class attributes, isn't that rare, but defining them within class bodies is definitely far more common, so verbosity should still be reduced in total even after accounting for the extra typing required to add the proposed new decorator to top-level functions. &gt;Basically, if you make self magic, then methods and functions now work differently. That may be fine in a static language, but in a dynamic language it goes wrong fast. Just look at the mess of this in Javascript. It works pretty well in Ruby, which is probably the mainstream language that's closest to Python.

To expand further on your thought for OP: You don’t even know enough to have the question are asking answered appropriately. Once you know why that statement is true, you’ll know how to ask the question you really want answered.
You can say the same thing about JavaScript. It's technically possible to walk to your office, but it's not always the best choice. People consider many things before deciding on a technology to use.
&gt; Why would you ever put a method in a class definition in Python that is meant to be called statically as a “free function” Because sometimes it make more sense to be in the class. For example: I have `class Navigator` with a function `calculate_distance(point_a, point_b)`. In my program's logic, only the Navigator class uses this function and rest of the program doesn't do anything with map coordinates. In situations like this it make sense to keep it as static method inside the class.
What are some realistic uses for a Twitter bot? Or the Twitter API?
Couldn't disagree more with this. Just because other languages have it implicit does not make it a good idea. Explicit is better than implicit.
That's true. But in practice, how often do you really create module-level functions which are intended to be used as class instance methods? I've certainly done it, and it can be useful for sure, but I've found there's often a more Pythonic and clean way of achieving what I want to achieve instead of dynamically assigning top-level instance methods. I don't really think adding `@instancemethod` above them creates a lot of friction, especially when accounting for the fact that it isn't too common. It actually makes it even more blatantly explicit that this is not an ordinary function, but one which needs an instance object passed as its first argument. The definitions are identical for instance methods inside and outside of class bodies with the small exception of that proposed new decorator.
Say you’re a totalitarian state and the country you’ve been antagonistic with for the past half-century is trying to have a free and open election. Now, with the Twitter bot and similar techniques what you can actually do, and follow me closely now, is exploit existing divisions in their population to put the person *you* want in power. All of this is requires maybe a day or so of setup of course but I think it’s becoming the standard use for one of these bots.
Advertising/promotion? Auto-replying to tweets or DMs. Overthrowing a foreign government.
Explicit is better than implicit, but IMO, if you're defining things inside of a class body, you've already made your intention explicit.
Implicit `self`/`this` is what prevents me from using other languages a lot of the time. Having it explicit is one of my favourite features of Python.
Especially if pulling from the conda-forge channel.
That's why I said "conceptual similarity" and not, say, "functional similarity". The novice programmer will likely see similarity in importing the classes in, say, pygame.Surface (for use in a new class she wants to write) that she would in this method of establishing inheritance in a new class. I'm aware that the two work differently under the hood.
I would learn other ML topics like linear regression before sinking time into learning about neural networks. It's rather useless if you don't know why or what you use them for.
I started with coursera. It's quite good.
Are you adding any \`request\` object in the template context that's not the current HTTP request?
You were supposed to destroy the scripting chaos, not join it!
r/learnpython
That seems far more confusing. That reminds me of the old exception syntax that everybody messed up, which is why it was removed in Python 3. \&gt; The error isn’t discovered until the traceback, which can be baffling. This doesn't fix that issue. You might be able to have a better traceback, but you're still gonna have to wait for a traceback unless you're assuming your IDE takes care of that. In that case, it seems like your IDE could also have an option for not putting class names in function definitions, which seems like a bug anyways. Once you put it that way, it seems like Python could provide a better error message in the current state too.
You're absolutely spot on. I can say with100% certainty (I'm their CTO) ActiveState plans on supporting Python 2 for many Operating Systems past it's official end of life. &amp;#x200B; We've created a brand new platform (http://platfom.activestate.com) and the state tool (command line client available now for Linux/Windows with Mac support on the horizon). One goal is to support these scripting languages when either the community or OS Vendors has moved on. The primary goal is to make building multi-language runtimes for your applications easier via the Platforms Build Farm. Ideally this will make it easier for communities to support their Languages on more Operating Systems. &amp;#x200B; I should note, if you're familiar with the Python 2 core and would like to get paid supporting it. We're hiring.
Why not just use COBOL? It's technically possible.
it's just saying "I wish it didn't use function-like syntax for things that aren't functions", which is pretty fair criticism to leverage.
If you are under a Linux system: cat you/log/file.log | uniq If you are under a windows subsystem parse the file in python ...
I urge you to join the Python discord: discord.gg/python One of the primary reasons or exists or to be beginner friendly, and provide support.
&gt; Anyone who has ever done any OOP understands what class A(B) means but not many other OOP languages use that syntax to describe it. Classes generally define two things: their polymorphism/inheritance, and their constructor. Why use the same syntax for both of those? why not make them a bit more unique? Why make your Inheritance declaration *look* like a constructor?
&gt;The index is calculated from the number of search engine results for queries containing the name of the language This is not the metric that I would use for pretty much any decision making process in my life. That's literally what this metric is saying: Googling "Python" may someday soon return more results than Googling "Java." Cool?
My work is focused on data so most of my code imports pandas. I use Sublime + Terminal on MacOS, deploying to linux servers. In Sublime I use autopep8 for fixing formatting and Jedi for autocompletion. If I'm learning a new module I usually do it in a Jupyter Notebook for convenience. If I want a quick terminal REPL I use ipython, it's a lot nicer than the plain python REPL. As for python environment I use the miniconda distribution of the conda package manager because I work with a lot of data/science packages and it handles their dependencies nicely and manages virtual environments (called conda environments here) nicely too. Having an environment.yaml beats requirements.txt for my needs. If you haven't put Sublime in your muscle memory yet I'd switch to vim though. I wish I did before I became too used to the Sublime way of doing things and now I'm stuck in the GUI and MacOS (for the keyboard shortcut consistency). If I'd just learned vim from the start I would have been much freer in where I could be productive. Good luck and have fun!
I mean, I had to do this just last week for work, so it's definitely a thing that happens. I just don't see how there is any real benefit to adding an @instancemethod decorator.
I don't like this. Did you know that you can construct the inheritance list programmatically? ``` In [4]: class B(*[A]): ...: pass ...: In [5]: class A: ...: pass ...: In [6]: class B: ...: pass ...: In [7]: l = [A, B] In [8]: class C(*l): ...: pass ...: ```
This question and answer are good. Too good. It's almost as if you colluded together.
First, you need to take a boo at [virtualenv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) \- take some time to create a virtualenv from the get go and learn about installing scripts and libs in them. You can start with [Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/), which will gives you an easier way to manage your project's Python dependencies using pip and venv under the hood. &amp;#x200B; Second, you can use Atom or Sublime, but two things that are great to have in an IDE are integrated debugging and testing features. VS Code does a great job at that for Python, being able to stop at a breakpoint and inspect objects and variables makes learning a lot easier (and even for experts once you have this available it's hard to go back to plain text editors and the basic Python debugger). PyCharm offer similar features, but AFAIK with Atom plugins you've just got a simple UI for the basic Python debugger and do get the same level of introspection as VS Code or PyCharm.
Cool! What are your impressions of him?

Yet another package manager. Sigh...
(...) works for other things besides argument signatures, for instance a tuple. And class MyClass(parent1, ...) follows the trend that () is a tuple that has the parent classes. Dont get me wrong, I get what you/the article is saying. It just seems like a silly complaint.
Well played :D
Does it perform well? I already have a hostsman but it's from like the 90s and has many bugs and performs slowly sometimes.
There's also benefits to this syntax-- metaclasses, class preparation, ability to dynamically decide base classes with argument unpacking, and more.

super() is 100% syntactic convenience. In any unusual places to use super, you have to (and can!) go back to the original syntax. This proposal has a non-syntactic component, made evident by the cascade of other changes (like your @instancemethod idea) that are required to make it workable.
I'm not sure what "this" is referring to here.
I didn’t realise using hosts file to block ads was still a thing.

Thanks for doing this! Can I have an invite please?
That's entirely fair. I like explicit self, because it fits in with one of the nice debugging features of python: If you want to know where a variable is defined, just look up the file. It's either a local variable, an argument to your function, a global variable, or an import. Implicit self breaks that. Starports break it too, but if you use starports, you deserve whatever debugging hell you find yourself in.
Here are some list resources: https://filterlists.com/ https://hl2guide.github.io/All-in-One-Customized-Adblock-List/ https://blocklist.site/app/ (click more info on the list you want, then you will see the url you will need for that list) https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/update-the-best-blocking-lists-for-the-pi-hole-alternative-dns-servers-2019/13620
I bought a Pi for this very reason.
This is an example of an "exact cover" problem (see Wikipedia). You can write your own solver, or use an existing one, e.g. my [Polyform Puzzler](http://puzzler.sourceforge.net/) software. It still requires effort just to understand how to represent the puzzle, and some programming effort to set up the puzzle for the solver.
No it isn’t. Pihole is a DNS black hole - it’s a DNS Server with a blacklist. It doesn’t use /etc/hosts at all
To my mind python is more like the old man on the street now than a buzzword. It's been popular and the big player for over 10 years. If anything its the defacto leader in a number of fields and taking on new challengers now.
One of my bots tracks the frequency of tweets with a keyword in it and tweets when there's a spike the use of that word. I made it in 2015 when during a tornado warning I noticed I was looking at two variables when I searched for the keyword 'torndao': the amount of time that passed between multiple people tweeting about it, and if they mentioned any location. I decided to automate it and make an event tracking bot. There's other bots used for research such as riot prediction, some are used to enter twitter lotteries/contests, some are used to generate silly messages, and of course, some are used unethically. I've even seen one that tweet pictures of birds at bird feeders, but sadly that one is offline. (I plan on building one of those eventually, but I can't get good exposure with my feeder because of the layout of my patio) The twitter api makes for a really nice place to either put things your programs/build/projects generate, or a place to get input for programs etc.
Python can kick javascripts ass. But to get a job for coding your probably gonna need to know javascript because people hire if you have that skill. There are books and YouTube tutorials that are really good

The current class syntax (`class A(b, c, *dynamic_bases, metaclass=meta, prep_arg="sphagetti")`)
However, the reason I like the similar way of specifying things is for conceptual simplicity. The way it is written, it appears that instance methods are just regular functions, which is exactly what they are. Your instancemethod solution works, but it hides this.
Actually it does, or it can use /etc/hosts.
My unsettling conclusion is that someone with access to all of our electronic communication, and the power to devote an entire dev team to this....like Idk, say the government? ...could be mildly successful in killing me and keeping my family from even looking for a while.

&gt; you never ~~cross layers~~ the streams.
 Write code.
Try discovering advanced Python features to improve your code, like using generators, context managers etc.. But more importantly, a good software developer cares about data structures, complexity, and has a good knowledge in algorithms. This makes languages just tools that you can switch easily.
How good are you at python ? If you are new look at some videos by sentex on YouTube, I’ve always liked him. Regarding GUI’s, look into qt or tkinter, both have good resources on YouTube and the python documentation website.
Your initial post was an opinion. It's a gatekeeping opinion.
I’m using your software. I run my solver that calls _init_.py, but all I’m getting is solving MyPuzzle: in the run window. When it runs, I always return no solutions. How do I go about inputting the puzzle under the coordinate system in the program? Thanks.
It’s a DNS server, so it will check it’s own hosts file for any outgoing request, just like every other DNS server (or any server, really) - but that has nothing whatsoever to do with pihole, and to say that that’s how pihole works, let alone “that’s the entire deal behind pihole” is simply not true. What’s happening is occurring outside of pihole at another layer altogether
Thank you so much! Just what I was looking for!
Thanks!!!
Yeah one of my projects was using cartopy for doing some location based analysis and that package specifically really didn't like the conda package manager. I gave up eventually on it.
Try "credit = float(input("Enter a number: ")
Hi! First off, in general, instead of pictures of code, please post it, formatted (format blocks by indenting everything four spaces) Anyways, your code. You are very close. Just change line 2. The right-hand side, starting from the equals sign, should read '`= int(input())`'. Your code is backwards. The argument to input should be a string that functions as the prompt the user sees. That can be blank, if you want. The important thing is the way to change the data type -- you use functions like `int()`, `float()`, etc., passing in the data you want changed
YES it worked! Thank you
Input needs a string passing into it, it will return a string; in this case your number. Once you have that string you need to cast it to an int. float = int(input(‘input number &gt;’)) Replace int for float if you want decimal places. Would be correct
There are several reasons and these are what I believe to be the main ones without getting too "religious". I also write this as a professional PHP developer who enjoys writing both PHP and python (in my spare time). As has been mentioned most of these things are C/C++ with a wrapper. In python each instance gets to choose which libraries to load where as in PHP it's a system wide config change and now every instance of PHP doesn't just have access to it, it has to have it. This not necessarily a downside of PHP, this is more of a fact of its designed use, generating webpages. To follow on, python is designed to be run as an application rather than a service making it better suited for running these sort of tasks and it can run a GUI. Lot of these things come from universities and they teach python over PHP. A lot of machine learning has come from Google and they like python, it's one of there "blessed languages". The snowball effect. Python is easier for people where programing is secondary (e.g. data researchers) to use and so a good library is written to help (e.g. nupy - to keep the same example) and then because there is one, someone else decides to make another (e.g. pandas) and so on. Juypter notebooks, just look this up as I can't explain how useful this for experimenting with things.
Thank you for this in depth explanation
Thank you🙏
Awesome. I'm a beginner too and am using the SoloLearn app.
I’ll look that up, I need new ways to learn code instead of just YouTube. Although YouTube is a good place to learn.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBME1ZyHiP8&amp;list=PLQVvvaa0QuDdVpDFNq4FwY9APZPGSUyR4 This is a bit old, but it might serve you to see how you can go about creating a desktop application with python.
Ohoho... It is not python question. Why use neural network? It is not the best way to recognize corners (really, it is the hard math work needed here). But, there is a way, I think you may try. Depending on size of your line and image, try to generate and mark down small slices (eg. 10x10 pixel), that shows just corners in different directions, and emptyness and lines. Teach your algorithm by any classifier (bias, SVM not really matters to try), what is corner, and what is not. After that just iterate 10x10 pixel slices, by stepping 9 or so (0-10, 9-19 etc.). From start to end, and count, how much corners it find. It should give you much better performance. If not working, try change stepping. Hope it works!
No collusion! No collusion! Hey look over there, look at that hat. What a hat!

Yeah I know there are better solutions. But if this works in machine learning, the initial purpose it’s intended for will work also.
For GUI you could look into appjar.info. It is not as flexible as the other solutions, but quicker.
&gt; boast their ambitious theories as fact, many scientists get pissed off and basically shut down. Check again, I mostly avoid absolutes. Which portion did I misspeak absolutely? The geometry is irrelevant, it's just an easy way to show case patterns. It's more about behavior, and change as abstractions. That said, I do want to get into the math more in depth(need to write proofs for my work), but I first need to write down all the abstracts. I've already written some of the proofs. Instead of making it hard, I wrote the using simply + and - to prove it These aren't multiple topics, more like one topic with different energy levels. The abstraction is the pattern, the topic is the object we fill the pattern with.
Bit late! What's your beef with 2to3? I ported a moderate-sized project to py3 - I didn't see the big issue...
Because PHP, from its very foundation, is a web programming language (it is even part of the name). That is basically its sole reason for existing and what it was created for. It's also the reason you have to open each file with `&lt;?php` because it is basically expected to be run ebmedded within a web page. Most people feel that using PHP outside of the web is using it for an unintended purpose. That said, if you are integrating your Reddit bot to a PHP application then it makes perfect sense to access the Reddit API using PHP. It would lack a lot of mature functionality that the Python wrapper has though.

Is there a DIY article for the bird feeder one? I might do this but use my dogs instead.
Agreed. This is such a minor complaint that I'd say it doesn't warrant any discussion. I'd even argue "I think the parens syntax looks nice" is a better argument than anything you could say for this `class Foo from...` syntax. This could only possibly be confusing to someone that is completely new to Python classes. &gt; BTW, even experts occasionally make the mistake of typing “def” where they meant “class”, and the similar syntax means the code is valid. Yeah, I do this on occasion. It becomes immediately apparent what is wrong even if it's technically "valid."
I'd take a 2-pronged approach: read a bit about the theory, and then go and play around with implementing some simple neural nets. Great intro-level theory article: [https://towardsdatascience.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-neural-networks-series-part-1-2b90b87795bc](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-neural-networks-series-part-1-2b90b87795bc) Sklearn has an easy API to work with in the beginning. Please note that it won't scale! [https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neural\_networks\_supervised.html](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neural_networks_supervised.html)
You might want to check out Visual Studio Code - it supports [remote debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) in a container. And unlike pycharm (which was great when I used it) there isn't a license cost. No need to ask for the expense. If you are starting a job, first you may want to ask around the office. Assuming there are others already working with Python, there may be existing standards and workflows they would prefer you use. Or maybe you wind up starting that conversation since it hasn't happened yet. Makes getting help and sharing work much easier.
Please note that this is just if you want a quick intro to get you going! For a deeper understanding, I vote for TerraPyro's Udacity suggestion
The post literally says at the end that introducing it at this late stage would be a bad idea. The point is entirely about having empathy with the confusion of beginners.
Do I understand correctly that you're trying to get all of the cells in your notebook to run, on a schedule? E.g. "run all the code in this notebook at 3pm on sundays"? If so, I'd recommend: 1. (Install runipy) \[[http://deeplearning.lipingyang.org/2018/03/28/run-jupyter-notebook-script-from-terminal/](http://deeplearning.lipingyang.org/2018/03/28/run-jupyter-notebook-script-from-terminal/)\] 2. Schedule a cron job that has runipy run your notebook at whatever time you'd like
That's not true. Class method factories exist and would fall apart with implicit `self`. It's the same reason you have to do `let parent = $(this);` in jQuery. You lose more context the deeper you go...which is bad.
Reading is important; docs, articles, books, Reddit, whatever. But most importantly you just need to practice. You could read every book written but if you never write any code you're still not going to be good. With experience things start to "click" like they wouldn't from just reading. Figure out an area of interested and try to work on a simple project relevant to that. &gt; is python better than JavaScript No. Is a flathead screwdriver better than a Phillips? I'd personally pick Python over JavaScript when when possible... But JavaScript is what's gonna be running in a browser. So JS is *required* for web development, but Python is not. I still choose to use a Python backend, but honestly there's a lot to be said for using the same language across the stack (Node).
Simple answer: PHP is a pain in the dick. Those things *could* be done, but it's like why would I fry my egg on an engine block when there's a stove available?

Maybe web apps, or code bases with not much data processing pipeline would be okay to port using tools like 2to3. However, the project I migrated involved tons of networking data processing. What was the nature of the project you migrated?
perhaps [https://github.com/nteract/papermill](https://github.com/nteract/papermill) ?
I have thought to make one to track keywords and dump them to my personal assistant, but it'd be a lot of work when i can just monitor stuff manually. Probably if i was busier i would look more into it.
Lol im good but your life seems pretty sad
Says the guy locking posts
Skimming the docs it looks like a useful package. Does it handle mixed states (density matrices)? There's a spelling typo in "Jozsa."
Sure? But are there more supporting reasons, or only this one? I don't expect one reason to tear down a bunch of reason why this change can't happen in short order.
Another python tool we don’t need.
What I use for this is papermill as someone else recommended, running on AWS Lambda, the output gets conveniently saved to s3
I read about papermill, can you share if there’s any tutorials on such pipelines?
I usually write my python GUI programs in pyqt and launch it from a batch file.
make not of blogs and other resources that discuss python. Don't worry if you can't understand it all. you might find something you can use and recall something you need later. keep a cheat sheet or code journal where you can look back and look at how to do certain things or little algorithm snippets. Maybe ridiculously heavily commented source code that helps you remember how to do some cool things you learned how to do. jupyter labs is great for this.
Still a work in progress, but lots of practice ideas and tests for you at https://github.com/kyclark/playful_python
solve sequential coding challenges like cryptopals or khan academys cryptography challenge
You definitely don't need to know both languages, but it will help a lot. It also depends on what you want to work on and what the company does. For example, you could be writing a backend api in Python, or simple reporting/admin scripts. You might not ever need to look at any frontend js code because someone else will do that part. If you want to do any frontend work at all, you should definitely get familiar with JavaScript.

Eh. As someone who started with python and now medium skill with javascript, I prefer the explicit definitions. Implicit namespaces was one of my biggest hurdles with javascript. It's just another personal preference with no real benifit.

&gt;I read about papermill, can you share if there’s any tutorials on such pipelines?
If i hear anything a ton, its, "you should learn python" I hear that it can do so much. The problem i have is that python is not the only thing you need to learn. Ive looked at jr python positions on the interwebs and none of them are about python. They seem to have left out the main technology thats used. Python seems to be just a small thing used for a much bigger thing. Learning python really isn't doing me any good because im A.) not a data scientist or B.) i dont know django, flask, Java, js..If i dont want to do web dev, am i forced to use it for data analysis or data science? What are the other positions that make money if i dont want to be a web dev or data A / S ? and what are the paths to do these other things? Tahnks!!

Do you mean faster playback or faster generation? Atm I'm trying to offload each pixel onto my gpu. Been reading tutorials about PyCuda
[This is the closest I can find](http://feedertweeter.net/developers) with [this hackaday article](https://hackaday.com/2013/12/10/solar-powered-tweeting-bird-feeder/) It's a solid writeup, albeit the writeup is old and not every link is still online
what's it called?
Python is a tool like any other. You can’t just master basic syntax, the standard library, and call it a day. You have to apply it to something that people care about. Data science is one example, and web dev is another. There are plenty of other examples as well. Have to seek out jobs and look at technical requirements.
I'm not sure I agree. If anything it should be something like `class(*bases, **keywords) MyClass:` which mostly resembles what the metaclass gets, but this isn't of particular practical use. A foolish consistency ... What *would* be incredibly useful is to allow dots in class/function definitions: import mod class Foo: pass class Foo.Bar: pass def mod.qux(): pass Among other things, this would make dealing with `collections.namedtuple` and `enum.Enum` much easier. Since class/function definitions *already* act like assignments, this shouldn't be particularly terrible ...
Its never too late. It could be like type-hints, optional.

Playback. I dont see why this has to be real-time and focusing on the result rather than the implementation makes the task more appropriate for python
I read Python In A Nutshell and that really helped me to sort of grok PEP-8 and the Zen of Python without actually being exposed to it as such. If you've got some CS theory in your background, I found it a great way to dig into why Python is "Pythonic" and like kind of what that means from a coding perspective.
Thanks, I'll check it out.
As you learn, continually push yourself by diving into unfamiliar areas of the language itself and how it can be used.. look into stuff like automation, machine learning, web dev, etc... Find something you like and figure out to use python to do it. Much luck 😁
[Hostsman](http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.htm#Related)
Cool, thanks for the links. I'll take a look into it and see whether it'll be feasible to include such a feature in future releases!
Oh. Well. All I have to do is change the frame rate when I turn the png files into a video or increase the steps between each frame.
JavaScript is good for frontend web development. Python doesn't do that. In other domains, JavaScript is next to nothing. Python is next to everything. Read and write code to improve your skills. There is an infinite number of projects you can do. You just need a little imagination.
yes, you can. use pyQt. Having said that, why not make it a web application?
Looks like there is a [logreduce](https://pypi.org/project/logreduce/) on PyPI, although I haven't used it. &amp;#x200B; You could sign-up for a free SumoLogic account, injest your logs into it, and use their [log reduce](https://help.sumologic.com/05Search/LogReduce) feature. I mention Sumo (it's not Python, it's just SaaS) because logreduce can be fiddly to set-up and tweak and Sumo offers a good UI and backend.

Could you answer the same question, but for a web app? Might be useful to myself and others :)
Learn about advanced language constructs. 3 of the most important ones, in my opinion, are: * Generators (`yield`), makes producing sequences and iterating a joy * List comprehensions, easily map/filter data * The `with` statement and context managers, clean up resources on exceptions/successful finish (especially nice with the `@contextmanager` in `contextlib`
Some people pick the strangest hill to die on
I’d recommend going to the official websites tutorial because it’s really in depth and teaches you all of the basic syntax. Here’s the website —&gt; https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/
I was looking more for video tutorials but this loos pretty helpful too, thanks!
Keep that attitude and keep on doing what you’re doing.

Python immutable strings really bothers me. I've heard the argument for them but they weren't convincing. Other than that, I'm enjoying Python. It can do more than PHP but PHP was so damn easy.
Thanks!
Have a look at wxpython for your gui. pyQt has some proprietary issues if you are planning on monetizing the app in any way (as I understand it - don't know the details but just passing on the warning I've seen many times). I have tried pyQt and tkinter and have finally settled on wxpython for my guis. And yes you can do everything you mentioned in python. My current project collects data from the internet, prepares and saves it in a database and then uses that db for analysis all within a wxpython gui.
&gt;Python immutable strings really bothers me. Really? Immutability is so popular these days thanks to the Functional Programming crowd.
A Robertson is better than both 😉
Yes, you could do this using only Python. You would need to use a graphical user-interface toolkit (GUI toolkit) like PyQt or the standard tkinter toolkit that comes with Python. PyQt offers more, but if we're talking a simple user-interface here then tkinter would work just fine as well. What you may want to do first is to write the core logic (the data filtering logic) first and then give it a visual display after you have the core logic working.
Hello, I have several tutorials and live streams that might be helpful. Live coding stream: PyQt5 GUIs in Python, builds a simple Bitcoin price checker - https://www.devdungeon.com/content/live-coding-pyqt5-guis-w-python - and a related tutorial on PyQt5 https://www.devdungeon.com/content/python3-qt5-pyqt5-tutorial Live coding stream: Python GUIs with Kivy, another bitcoin price checker, but using Kivy to make an Android app - https://www.devdungeon.com/content/live-coding-python-guis-w-kivy GUI Programming with Python (Tkinter) - https://www.devdungeon.com/content/gui-programming-python
&gt; Having said that, why not make it a web application? I'll counter this question with a *why make it a web application* when a desktop app would be fine for this use-case?
&gt; Could you answer the same question, but for a web app? Might be useful to myself and others :) I'm not the author of the parent comment, but yes you could do this as either a desktop or a web app. The difference between the two is mostly the user-interface. For example, with a desktop app you might use something GUI toolkits like PyQt or tkinter. On the other hand, with a web app you'd use HTML and maybe some CSS and JavaScript depending on how complex the web interface needed to be. The main point here is that the core logic (the data filtering code) would be the same regardless of what visual interface you went with (this assumes you separate your core logic from the visual interface's code).
hey you can theoretically use any "webcam" that runs on USB and has a driver for Linux ... just look in the internet if you can find a test for webcams?. I use the original Raspi Cam (black) without the IR-filter. :) but the quality is very very bad :(.
interesting the WayScript
Spent the whole day yesterday doing this, posting it now so that if someone googles it later they don't have to read tons of documentation like I did.
You don't even need runipy - you can just run jupyter notebooks using the `nbconvert` command line tool which comes as part of jupyter. Something like `nbconvert my_notebook.ipynb --to html --execute`. Might be able to run it without generating the html file too. Or just delete that file afterward if you don't need it.
Nicely done! But you forgot **ipconfig /flushdns** on Windows. Why? There are DNS caches on your machine that you need to remove or else some of the sites will not be blocked. &amp;#x200B; [https://serverfault.com/a/452269](https://serverfault.com/a/452269)
I would need to see your code to answer, and I'm not sure you understand what's there. Have you read the project documentation? Looked at the dozens of existing puzzles? I'm happy to help, but this is not the best place to discuss. Instead, send email to the project mailing list, [puzzler-users@lists.sourceforge.net](mailto:puzzler-users@lists.sourceforge.net)
What does self refer to in a nested class body?
What is your input? Audio? MIDI? If Audio, I know genre classification is an open AI problem with lots of research. It is limited by there not being many royalty-free and diverse datasets. Tempo is detectable with decent accuracy these days.
module.func(arg) And module.class.method(self, arg) are now ambiguous at a call site if method and func share a name.
The existence of a top level function implies the existence of a (strong) interface.
Learn Crystal
I think audio from a input device like a microphone would be good.
Ah. That will be even more difficult than working with studio recordings. I’d recommend searching academic papers on signal processing, signal noise elimination, and audio-processing AI. Things like Fourier Transforms will become your basic tools. I’m unsure what your experience level is, are you familiar with basic signal processing?
"Function call syntax" makes sense because inheritance in Python resembles a normal function call. Below is some example code (D is inherited from A on Tuesdays and from B on other weekdays, and E is derived from A, B, C on Tuesdays and A, B on other weekdays) from datetime import datetime is_tuesday = datetime.now().weekday() == 1 class A: pass class B: pass class C: pass class D(A if is_tuesday else B): pass some_classes = [A, B] if is_tuesday: some_classes.append(C) class E(*some_classes): pass
There is @BotDuCul that tweet every word in french follow by "of ass"
You absolutely can. I know tkinter is well documented and pretty straight forward. I've used it a few times. I have one application up that touches a SQL server for all it's data through a standalone application. Good enough for the powers that be at my job. It's simple but it works great.
There isn't a single objectively correct way to convert Python 2 string literals to python3. This alone makes migrating more than 90% of code automatically impossible. :(
It's possible to get a job knowing neither Python nor JS if the job doesn't require those languages. A C++ developer is unlikely to need any Python or JS knowledge. Knowing different languages and programming paradigms can help you think about a problem differently and solve it more efficiently or more clearly, regardless of what language you wrote code in.
I agree, this does seem possible.
I'm just here, pleasantly surprised that this wasn't another img to ascii converter...
You shouldn't use a microphone to record the music. Use a Digital method of analysing the audio if you can, less occlusion
Eww pipenv
&gt;PHP is super cool for what it was intended to do A templating language. Like jinja and Mustache. Except *Smarty* exists, so nothing is real anymore.
I guess,scipy. signals library should work for you but you need to know the basics of signal processing
You're polygon be hearin from the pun patrol.
I’m a beginner, so no. Ignore my last idea... how would I approach regular studio recordings?
Okay, thanks for the input, what should I use then?

Have you actually used PHP?
I am sorry, i am a novice so please dont be mad. I was not able to extract graphviz as it is so i downloaded a zipped graphviz2.38. I guess i have to add the path in the computer environment to make this executable. However i have also used some of the tweaks from stack exchange like changing the pydotplus file but it didnt work then as well.
As many had mentioned, you can use PyQt to create the UI and compile it to .exe using pyinstaller. Here's a simple Python + PyQt5 project that I did a few weeks ago: https://github.com/akmalhakimi1991/mousemover
Or the "fix" for the radar machine introduces the flaw that causes Armageddon and the future was revealed out of necessity because otherwise it would not have occurred.
Tkinter has an old-school look, but I've found it to be pretty easy to grasp and fairly versatile. I can't speak for other packages, but I do recommend tkinter.
As a beginner who loves the desktop space, I wonder if when I become a professional they’ll still be a thing...

I managed to get to 100% but as a beginner I'm afraid I'll be a burden to the team. Will there be any balance towards distributing us newbies equally among the teams?

Thanks /u/agree-with-you
Do project Euler (Google it) for math and code challenges. JavaScript is bad. Learn a low level compiled language like c to supplement your understanding. JavaScript is ass.
Umm--"penultimate"--I do not think it means what you think it means. IF "We become the penultimate of that canvas, while something else is likely the penultimate of our canvas"--what follows these penultimate items?
A web app comes with a lot of stuff attached to it which makes it more complicated than a desktop app. Here what he needs is a simple gui to generate a report. Probably it can be done in a few lines of code. As a web app, it requires a database, a web server, a web framework, html/css/JavaScript, take care is security, and so on... Unless it’s a learning experience, I cannot see the advantages of making this a web app.
Good point. I was just trying to be acute by being a little obtuse--which isn't right.
Just cluster the data to determine groups or genres.
Avoid platform headaches.
Hey! Let's do it together
Just write and read lots of code. Do lots of small projects from start to finish. Write tutorials to learn yourself.
Impressive!
it means second last. Each one was penultimate as it was being described. Not penultimate in a grand scale.
hey! haha i really thought no one will care i'm glad for your reply thanks
PyCharm all the way
Awesome!
I was trying so long to start learning python, but couldn't do it. Maybe this time it'll work 👍
Project Euler!
Does this capture IR data from the remote?
Can you share on GitHub?
I've actually *just* recently solved your exact problem https://github.com/dimdog/visualization/blob/master/pyglet/audioprocessor.py This is set up to push events to redis as part of a larger system doing a visualization. Right now it is doing Beat analysis, note analysis, and something called a "Power Spectrum" analysis that seems pretty useful for what I was working. Feel free to ask any questions!
I’m not disagreeing by any means but i think some people might find some basic html/css easy to use compared to some of the desktop options. I personally found tkinter to be rather confusing for some reason but like using pyqt. If it’s just a little personal web app you don’t necessarily have to go crazy with it, some basic buttons on a local ran webpage that launch functions or other premade scripts would be pretty simple and lightweight made on something like flask without having to do much.
Great enthusiasm - i agree!! Ramalho’s book Fluent Python is a fantastic resource. It rarely leaves my desk or closes. Keep coding!
Not IR, its a 454 MHz remote
I created this tonight after the sad death of ghostbin. I wanted it to somewhat resemble ghostbin but not copy it. Thought this was a fun project to work on. If you'd like to see the source code it's available here: https://github.com/M4cs/Psty-Public

Likely 433MHz or 315MHz
What exactly is that
Interesting. So the time-travelers go back in time to ensure that their future happens. That is the *12 Monkeys* approach with different intentions. In your scenario, they always go back in time, and the future always occurs, creating the closed loop I described.
Gimme your source code so I can get my self promoted
How do you even interface with an outlet? I'm confused.
Why do you format the number in binary lol
You are right, I just woke up and thought it was 454, not 434/433
You can buy almost anything with blutooth/wifi built in to them. There are [toaster ovens](https://juneoven.com/technology) with camera and Alexa compatibility, [LED bulbs](https://www.pcmag.com/roundup/334096/the-best-smart-light-bulbs) with wifi and what I assume op is using; [smart sockets.](https://www.fksmall.com/shop/appliances/wireless-smart-wifi-power-socket-home-appliance-automation-plug-timer-switch-wall-us-plug-remote-control-by-phone/) There is also the infamous Samsung fridge with twitter on it.
Thanks kind stranger
Awesome! I love flask for IoT stuff. There’s a really cool RESTful extension for flask that you can use to make a rest api for your commands. You could call the api on the button press but what I really like it for is creating google or Alexa triggers with IFTTT. Basically, if [whatever google home/Alexa command] then [webhook to api] Works like a charm.
Does this mean that you can copy some person's gate remote stuff and break into their house ? Isn't it unsafe and scary ?
I could argue that a Phillips head screw driver is far superior to flat head. Don't you hate it when you're trying to screw a flat head screw in and the driver keeps slipping out because there's nothing to hold it in? I know this is besides the point of the comment but just some food for thought. :)
The way around the problem is that the future is immutable as is the past. What benefit is there to any sort of time travel other than a purely subjective "it makes a good story" type thing? Can you travel either backward or forward and then comeback? But let's say it is 1995 and you time travel 2 hours into the future to see how 12 monkeys ends--so you blink out of existence for one rotation of an electron moving around an atom and reappear in the same spot but 2 hours later. Oh, shit. Earth is now more than 1,000,000 miles away from you as it and the sun and the milky way continue to obey the laws of the universe that you so callously thought you could ignore.
Thanks for the reply, I already use it for web scraping as well as administrative scripting and automation, which ive been doing for several years. While i do know it's not a tool or utility to be used all by it self, I'm just curious about other possibilities, other than what i already know about, which is basically what you just repeated back to me. I guess ill look around a little more..lol &amp;#x200B; Thanks again!
Do each of those connect to an API by the company? Is there an industry standard to allow for anyone to access them easily in any number of ways? Do they use Mozilla's Internet of Thing API? I'm so, so curious about this subject, and I just heard about it maybe 50 seconds ago
Good read, thanks.
I find Python very flexible for developing desktop applications. I would stick to Pyqt, however it takes some time to find your way around. I have written a tutorial about developing a desktop app to make a video with your webcam. It can give you a quick overview of the flow of a program, including how to develop a pattern to make your codebase reusable: [Step by step guide to building a GUI](https://www.pythonforthelab.com/blog/step-by-step-guide-to-building-a-gui/)
I would first look at the API documentation of Discord. https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro
My knowledge ends at "this exist", but maybe someone else can help you out.
Why does the the future have to be immutable? Why can the travelers not have free will in their own time? When they are in their own time, time travel has not occurred and may as well not exist. If so, it has no bearing on what they can and cannot do, so they can have free will. Unless, of course, you simply do not believe in it altogether. I always assumed that whatever machine is used to time-travel is perfectly capable of also accounting for the movement of the Earth. Time travel generally allows for teleportation, so why not use both and move through all 4 dimensions (considering the dimensions as x, y, z, and time)? You could use a geocentric view and fix the origin of your coordinates on the center of the Earth and specify your location relative to it, having the system take care of the movement. Or, if your system requires homing beacons, your system is by default relative to the Earth.
From my limited experience most smart household appliances doesn't have an official API. There's just an app... However, many of them still has an unsupported API. Other things, like Philips hue, have a more or less official and supported APIs.
twss
Will do some more reading. I just saw that IKEA has some cheapish smart light bulbs that I'd like to see if I can program.
👍
Who wins in a fight between a half-sentient amazon toaster and the outlet that it itself is plugged into though?
Yes. Usually there are a few more steps involved, but not really difficult to clone most remote keys. Earlier this year I watched a talk where someone could take control of a Tesla by walking with ~10 feet of the key with a special sniffer. Finished cracking the commands to lock/unlock doors and turn the car on after about 90 seconds. $200 in off the shelf hardware to steal a $35k car.
Yeah I've actually made a controller for Ikeas lights but I found them a bit to unreliable for everyday use. The API is not documented (iirc) but we'll explored by now. There's a Python library that works pretty well!
Am I blind or is there not a place to sign up? Do you just remember and jump on the site when it’s time?
Damn that's some serious problem. When IOT is everywhere this will get even worse.
No signups at all, just show up every week and there's a new thread on Tuesday. Post in the thread--*if* you want :P (it's entirely option, some people just follow along silently, too)
It's too confusing
I'll pitch $5 on the Github!
Sounds good! I’ll check it out! Thanks
In the DIY home automaton world we use ESP8266 microcontrollers and the MQTT protocol. There are front ends like Home Assistant.

The store that sold both of them to you
He has a remote that controls his power outlet, he made an app that listens for the code the remote is sending out when he presses the on and off buttons, saves them, and then allows him to send those same codes from his app, allowing him to control the outlet from his phone.
Thanks! It doesn't handle density operators yet, but I will be adding that in the future.
 Thanks for sharing the information about the Python and keep updating us. &lt;a href="[https://www.credosystemz.com/training-in-chennai/best-python-training-in-chennai/](https://www.credosystemz.com/training-in-chennai/best-python-training-in-chennai/)"/&gt;Python Training in Chennai&lt;/a&gt;
this was the kinda shit i was looking for, mate. A fucking good one
Check out OpenHAB.
Perhaps a 2FA like YubiKey is a solution for such things?
damn that's interesting. Got a link?
Cool, sounds interesting
Nice work. Though I'd tend to think Flask is not the best tool to use here (as, seemingly, just a GUI) - especially if you don't already know HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery. PyQt is the GUI I'd recommend - about as nice to use as Flask's Python code, but without needing to serve HTML/CSS/etc from a socket. Another benefit is that, if this is something you want to distribute in the future - and you should consider it, it looks useful - you could painlessly rewrite it to C++ (moving from PyQt to C++'s Qt is almost no work) and build it as a native app (that will cross-compile, afaik, for all desktop operating systems, and android with the ndk).
Tkinter for GUI is not that hard. Try it out! :)
&gt; Isn't it unsafe and scary ? It is, you are right. Not OP's program, but how unsecured the device is. That's the Internet of Things for you.
 This information is really useful to me. [Python Training in Velachery](https://www.credosystemz.com/training-in-chennai/best-python-training-in-chennai/)
It doesn't have to be a remote, the controller could be an android app too. Its the back-end where flask, etc. are supposedly installed and served to the remote's (or a smartphone's) browser from what I understand.
If you post this in /r/learnpython I can maybe help a bit.
I'd like to know an explanation on this, I'm a beginner.
&gt; Python is a good choice for GUI application as long as it doesn't have really high performance requirements &gt; JavaScript with Electron can also be a solid choice Python with Qt5 is faster than electron in my (admittedly limited) experience.
It is about iteration. Each time gets better, like machine *learning*.
I'll plan to! I haven't finished the schedule page yet, so when I do I'll have to post an update and on Github!
This is pretty much it. You can really use whatever frontend you want. On the technical side, I have ~433MHz RF controlled outlets that have associated controllers. When I press a button on the remote, I listen to the code using a separate receiver that's wired to the GPIO pins on a raspberry pi, which also hosts my flask server
See comment up a little higher I made. Bottom line is it's RF controlled
Thank you!
The code sent is binary, but I could use the decimal or octal equivalent if I really wanted to
Not gonna lie. This made me chuckle.
Yeah, but the joke doesn't really work since he's given the answer over and over. Wouldn't they say, "no too low" "no too high" and he goes from below 19 to above 19 till he converges to 19? Why would a machine learn by incrementing in the same direction slowly while given the goal?
Do you recommend any resources for learning Jquery/Ajax with flask?
You know what? I'm fucking proud of you. Starting with Flask. It might _seem_ easy, but it really isn't. Everybody and their brother has their own way of using it and you had to figure out how it works for you. It's crazy easy to get stuck in trying to figure out any little thing and miss out on the big picture of building something useful. HTML and CSS. I don't know where you started or when, but it's the foundation of the web and again there's a thousand different ways to make it work, but you had to figure out yours. Fucking floats and centering and figuring out what font to use and what colors and what screen size and dimensions to focus on and what HTML version to use and what browser you care about and how to deal with rotation and everything else. A ton of distractions are around and you made it work for you. Javascript, JQuery/Ajax... thank the lord that you didn't waste time on the b.s. frameworks like React that over-complicate it all and abstract away the basics that you need to understand if you want to do anything productive. You built a solid foundation of knowledge AND you built something awesome. And you threw it all together and got something built from the back of the stack to the front. Well done. Pat yourself on the back. Keep on kicking ass.
Hex would look good too, and cut down the display length a decent amount
That's more the design of the screw than the driver.
I would find it more intuitive to feed data into the command via stdin instead of the template. Also, the template could be a required positional parameter instead of an optional one, as you always need a template to render. Something like this: $ cat data.json | jinja2-cli template.html &gt; result.txt $ jinja2-cli template.html data.json &gt; result.txt $ jinja2-cli template.html data.json data2.json data3.json -o output_dir $ cat template.html | jinja2-cli - data.json &gt; result.txt But that probably depends on use-case and preferences.
Well not really. To train a network (outside of reinforcement learning) you give it the answers, and let it iterates towards it. Of course this doesn't make much sense with one example, since usually you'll take some avarage of your error across the entire dataset to decie how to move.
I thought that about the data but, It really depends on the use case, by default stdin is template, because, if there is no data, you could just pipe in the template and expect the output be rendered. I was looking in to a way check if the template is a positional argument then try and get data from stdin (unless it's also a positional argument), and vice versa, but It turned out to complicate some things, with argparse, so I decided to stay with the unixy hyphens for the stdin reference
Ahh, that makes more sense to me now.
I’d like an explanation in that, I’m an intermediate,
Let's say you are the Machine. I put you in a program and your starting point is up against a wall. If you start running the code, lets say the Machine decides to move forward at an angle of 20•. If it hits the wall, next time, the machine might try to move forward but now at an angle of 35•. It will do so, over and over, until it finds the "best possible" path to the end. In this exemple, the only "problem" is that its only incrementing positively BUT AGAIN its a joke !
It was an animation library to control LEDs and other lights. Why would network data processing be at all different? I don't recall any differences in that area at all? I mean, are you porting to `async`? That would be a big deal, but that isn't "2 to 3". &gt; Also, I am familiar with the wide array of tools available currently, too many to name. Just take my word for it, they don't work. Noooo, that's not how scientific enquiry works. Indeed, I am immediately suspicious when you say things like that... &gt; Many leave out too many important details Like what!? You know, I worked in Python 2 for almost a decade and then switched everything over to 3 - the differences just are not that great. I really remember almost nothing about doing it even, but I changed hundreds of files with no hitches at all. In fact, I don't think I even used 2 to 3 once because I enjoyed the opportunity to read the code again. I used six in one project because I had to keep 2 to 3 compatibility and that was little extra work. I was using `from __future__ import` for years anyway. It was really no big deal, a bunch of global find and replaces and a few tweaks. &gt; and they have no runtime object level information. Why is "runtime object level information" important at all in porting from 2 to 3? You want all that 2-&gt;3 to be done and out of the way before "runtime" ever even exists. Skeptical... I suspect others are too, as you are downvoted.
overfitted with one data point
Not gonna lie. They had us in the first half.
&gt; There isn't a single objectively correct way to convert Python 2 string literals to python3. What percentage of string literals are binary strings, do you think? In my experience, it's consistently less than 5% over a wide range of applications. Don't get me wrong - those binary strings tend to be of prime importance when they do appear, but compared to the number of display strings, error messages, help text and the like, they are very little, and generally I know where they are. (Also, you can add the `b'` prefix in your Python 2 while you are investigating. It's a no-op, but really useful for planning your transition.) Yes, this cannot be automated away completely but it's not this terrible chore. "Leaving most strings alone" works nearly all the time, and there aren't that many applications for binary literals that they might be lurking somewhere unnoticed by anyone...
I'm in the middle of working on something kind of similar! I wanted a way to control an LED strip from my phone. To do this, I made a flask backend, react frontend web app that uses sockets to communicate with a separate computer that has the LEDs plugged in. It's at github.com/gcpreston/webcandy if you wanna check it out, I'm planning on posting a video demo soon.

indeed, if you install multiple packages and use a large base-repository (such as conda-forge) the current conda solver starts to choke and it takes a very long time even on powerful hardware. &amp;#x200B; For example, try installing \`conda install sage -c conda-forge\` from conda-forge, or \`conda install xtensor xeus-cling xtensor-r -c conda-forge\` .. it will take minutes to hours to solve.
Our main problem is mainly that installing new packages in existing environments, or generally installing multiple packages at the same time is fairly slow. &amp;#x200B; e.g. &amp;#x200B; \`conda install xtensor xtensor-r xeus-cling xsimd -c conda-forge\` will take quite a while to resolve with regular conda.
it makes it easier to try &amp; break things. mamba is a really thin wrapper at the moment -- only \~200 lines of code around conda.
This is \*\*not\*\* another package manager. This essentially \*\*is\*\* conda, just a slightly different solver that's faster. We do want to integrate this back into conda if possible, and we heavily push conda both for our own projects and others, in a cross-language fashion!
Find some work on a freelance website like Upwork, or maybe start your own project?
So can I assume almost any freelance sites?
Didn't really look into it but you guys literally call Mamba a package manager.
What do you mean by "assume" here?
Please tell me how class definition syntax could be improved.
I would assume most freelance coders would work full time and would be qualified so it seems strange to post on such sites
It's not strange at all. Not all freelance developers work full time, and it shouldn't really matter to you if they do or not, as long as your client agrees to your terms and schedule.
Oh I thought it was an ETL tool
What do you mean by "qualified"? A lot of companies will hire someone without a degree, what really matters is how good you are.
Thanks, looks like it's a real possibility then 😂
Well it seems dubious, a qualification is a guarantee after all
Note that you create compiled regex: &gt; rxloc = re.compile(r'\[Cell &lt;(\w+?) \([0-9A-F]{8}\)&gt;\]' But you're not using it - later you just use: &gt;location = re.search(r'\[Cell &lt;(.+?) \(', line)[1]
I still don't know what you mean by "qualification." If you can point me to these guaranteed candidates that be great cuz we're doing some hiring...
Why dick around with PyQt when a web interface immediately provides complete access from any device that supports a web browser and hosting cross-compatibility across even devices without a graphical environment installed?

What ? Really ? Python and ML not related ? I am just laughing at you.
I'm sorta in the same boat, but I have managed to get involved in dev at my job where I have experienced devs I can lean on when I get stumped. I even offered to have low pay or no pay for a bit, but many of these devs are so busy they are unwilling to help others...
This sort of thing is obviously against [the Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/). It's definitely not something that's actively used in the community.
Thanks, it is a good idea, I'll do it! But the problem 'working on my own' is not solve.
This IoT unsafe is all HTTP 1.0/1.1 again. Then efforts to force SSL over HTTP in every website came in, but if the user is a little unaware, and by a little I mean one 's' from the safety, because http and https, there goes all the encryption. Thing is HTTP is a protocol and everyone "have" to implement it to work with it, IoT relies only on the developer's good faith and expertise. Also, some IoT devices cant be updated, unless it has connection with internet, so what is in the wild is in the wild, like CVE-2019-1653. If OP read this, know that if I'm also proud of you, to learn everything with a goal is the best way to learn programming, otherwise you end up floating with so many possibilities and it's easy to get lost and not finishing anything, but please OP, do read about security and how to implement it. Safe software development is the only way we can avoid unwanted breaches or data leaks.

In my opinion, I think you should dig deeper into making your own product or software. Making a software for a certain niche or hobby where people will spend money. Can give you great sales with a small focus on advertisement. Running your own thing will generate a lot more income than working for somebody however requires a lot more time and effort. Do what you want but if your really skilled I would definitely try to make some sort of product. Everything from a mobile game to a computer software will do.
I've used Flask at scale. It's a go-to resource in several large scale environments I've been a part of. Django has it's place, but it's pretty weak to look down on anyone for not using it.
It seems that is exactly what I need. Thank you!
Yes, that is true. But at least you are learning from typically well written guides, and that will help you level up so you can get in with a dev eventually.

Lots of scammers on there and lots of big jobs offering peanuts. If it wasn't for that, it would be great. Upwork was better but now not only are fees large but now you have to pay to bid on a job.
Yeah that is what I would expect. To clarify, I didn't intend to say that Electron was a choice for high performance, just that it is a good choice if you know the web stack.
Time **is** (according to the physics of Einstein at least) as you say one of the 4 coordinates. But there are two points related to that. First if you want to change x, y, z--e.g. go from Dallas to London how do you do that? What over method you use you follow the laws of physics. The second--probably more important point is: What direction do the x, y, and z coordinates follow? Unlike time (at least as we perceive time) the other three coordinates don't have a direction while time does. So, maybe it is possible to change or manipulate the direction of time. But just as a trip to London follows basic physics and there aren't any Harry Potteresque portals to London you essentially need to start with the fundamentals of time to even start to attempt to circumvent those laws. That means understanding Einstein where mass and motion govern and the speed of light is constant. Under relativity "time travel" or a form of it is possible by simply going really close to the speed of light. But you aren't actually time traveling--since the speed of light is constant from all reference frames if you go as fast as the speed of light your "clock" will essentially slow down. (Why does your clock slow down? Because that is the only way for light to continue to move at its constant speed.) Now, maybe, there is something in quantum physics that allows time travel--but if you think relativity is difficult . . . Waving away all the nitty gritty about strings and quanta maybe there are infinite parallel realities and time travel simply requires skipping from one to another. I suppose it could happen but it seems that just means that the past and future are actually immutable--it just happens that all possible pasts and futures exist. You would not be changing the past or future you would simply be changing your subjective location to a different stream of events. There is also the possibility that we are just a simulation of some hyper intelligent being. If that is the case then it would seem there is some reason or fundamental requirement for our existence to be governed by the laws of the universe. Much as a computer is governed by CPU frequency, bus speeds, and whatever. IF that is the case then in theory we are still left with working with the rules as they exist or the being could decide to change the rules. Essentially this is no different than living with relativity and quantum physics but seems to add the question of whether the basic principals of physics are an absolute and the fundamental forces and laws of the universe as they are are the only way to get anything half-way interesting to a hyper intelligence. Lets say this being has a set of dials that can be twisted to change the values of the speed of light or the elctro-magnetic forces. If "it" dials down the speed of light it would seem out of necessity we would experience no change--all the other forces and physics would move in concert with the change in that factor. The being would see changes, like debugging a program, but for us--unless the whole universe suddenly was torn to shreds or splatted into a gooey mess like an egg dropped on a marble counter--we would experience no change. At any rate--the universe and laws that govern it seem to be interesting enough without the need for any sort of magic. Time travel, as dreamed of in literature and movies, seems mostly to be a by product of familiarity breeding contempt.
My take on it would be one has some skills in a job posting, but has no experience and no idea on other parts of what is being asked for. As a junior, sometimes we get stuck, and when on our own, we have noone to turn to for guidance, and support from fourms / code sites is hit/miss, so we worry about what happens when we get *really* stuck on a paid project...

Just to be clear, is this with macOS and CentOS dual-booting on the same computer? Check `sys.maxsize` on both Python interpreters. You may have a 32-bit installation of CentOS or a 32-bit Python installed on a 64-bit CentOS.
Very cool! How did you train the neural network? There's nothing relevant in the repository, as far as I can tell.
You have no call for the if statement. Line above five would need to end in :

OSX is running on my physical laptop. &amp;#x200B; **OSX** &gt;\&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys &gt; &gt;\&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.maxsize &gt; &gt;9223372036854775807 &amp;#x200B; **Centos 7** &gt;\&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys &gt; &gt;\&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.maxsize &gt; &gt;9223372036854775807 &amp;#x200B; Same value. &amp;#x200B; Just to be clear too, I am not looking for fixing any issue, this is just 4 fun that I am looking for this.
&gt;thank the lord that you didn't waste time on the b.s. frameworks like React that over-complicate it all and abstract away the basics that you need to understand if you want to do anything productive This sounds like you don't have a job in the modern front-end web dev industry. Because learning react is an asset, not a detractor. &amp;#x200B; Knowing basics is good, but if you know them a little, you definitely want to use modern tools.
I have just 8 years of python coding, but I’m not doing any of this mistakes.
If they're both 64-bit, then you've hit a physical limit in the CentOS VM. The total space that's available to allocate (memory allocated to the VM plus swap) isn't enough to hold the operating system and interpreter, plus the final string of 6G characters, plus any temporary objects that can't be freed until after the string is constructed. On macOS, you're paging memory to disk (that's what causes the machine to slow down), but the swap files can expand freely as long as you have free space on the primary hard drive, so you successfully allocate enough space to finish the operation.
You don't seem to understand. I agree with the content of the code of conduct. I don't agree with the SJW attitude to shove it in places where it's inappropriate.
Currently trying to program a potential cron job to grab, parse &amp; digest an XML payload retrieved from various instances to be sent to a telemetry software in Google Cloud Platform. A bit of a difficulty with the Google API client, for now. That they have native client libraries for many of their infrequently used services yet offer little for the Compute Engine frustrated my attempts in implementing secure designs (I prefer AWS Parameter Store compared to Google's implementation of their KMS).
My VM is 4 GiB RAM when my laptop is 8 GiB. I just tried on 16 GiB VM but same behaviour. **Something I forgot to tell** is that Linux gives me the Error message immediately, it does not seem to process while OSX is processing with no end (after 1min I stopped waiting).

457 merge commits out of 788 leave 179 non-merge commits. According the Github page you linked, that's more non-merge commits than any other single contributor. It's likely that Reitz was one of the initial small group of people who started the project, and most of his content commits were early in the project's history before it had attracted as many contributors. With more people joining, Reitz's role has evolved from "author" toward "editor", but that alone doesn't justify taking his name off the project.
Thanks for the advice!
I love that series! I actually just finished watching it. Definitely helped, thank you!
there’s a famous library that does this for you
 with open(file, 'a+') as f: f.write(your_data) r/learnpython is better suited for this. I suggest you post it there.
that's a Python2 vs 3 change. So guess who still has to code with an (almost) dead version ;P ?
I agree. Never said that's all it does, just that it uses hosts too.
Hmm, must just be an Ipython thing then, I should check if they fixed it. I clearly remember it biting me in the ass before.
Dammit! The famous off-by-one-error! ... except off by two. Basically, I'm so old I think I'm older than I am.
Good! I think it might be all the changes since v. 2.2.3 that make me stupid, or possibly heredity.
Your use of the phrase SJW shows you're already radicalized. I get that you don't think I hear what you're saying. What you don't understand is that I no longer care.

Working on a Discord bot specifically for... well, for me, really. I want one that both has some basic RPG functions as well as the ability to run 'ambient' background music based on custom playlists. There are several out there that do RPG stuff and others that do music, but none that quite do what I want... so I'm doing it myself! Last night I implemented a RegEx dice query parser that actually does what I expected it to do. I started working with an example, but it didn't accept a +/- bonus, so I went from scratch and it actually worked. Color me surprised!

I just finished a tool to quickly broadcast power and color packets to any LIFX bulbs on a given LAN faster than the other CLI tool (and mine supports python 3 ;) ). It's my first personal project for a while, haven't had the interest since I started coding for work, but glad I can still take the time to throw together a quick handy tool to relax.

Thanks for the great info!
As u/youguess said, it's a Python2 thing, so you're not quite wrong.
What is wrong with using the string syntax in log statements? I know that loggers have support for args syntax but how is it *wrong* to give it a ready-made string?
Pioneer the field! Tell others how to do it #be the first
Well, yes. It's utterly insecure and the RF-signal is easily replayed. IIRC, garage ports and gates normally have a rolling key (like cars), which cannot be duplicated (that easily). However, I suspect a lot of manufacturers use static keys. I have the same setup in my house (for some of the lights), and I treat it as insecure. Technically, anyone in range with the skillset, could turn on the lights. Therefor I do not use it for turning on/off critical equipment. A future goal is to migrate to something like z-wave or zigbee, which does both mesh (every unit is it's own range extender), feedback (it will tell you if the command has been received, and you can measure power output) and AES encrypted (optional). However, the Z-wave equipment is about 30 dollar for an outlet, and the RF433 stuff costs 10 dollar for 3 (plus a remote) Disadvante
I think the benefit to using the correct logging syntax is that it's only ever evaluated if the logger level is set correctly. If you had some expensive loop that printed out tons of info and the log level was not appropriate it would be skipped entirely. If you use say, an f-string, inside of the logger function that will still always be evaluated. Not 100% sure on that though.
An addendum to #1, if you are just looking for exact match in a string, using the `in` operator works really nicely
So we can all learn something, could you please tell us the name of this library?
OK, thanks for the input! We're playing with some variants of this and it's not super-straightforward to get things to line up at the moment :)
Sounds plausible. All I know is that all linters complain like crazy if you don't do it that way, and the logging module is really old (fun fact: it was introduced in 2.2.3, the version I started with) so I bet it's got some unintended side effects.
I'll have to search a few of those names, but thanks much.
Pretty neat, dude. Compare to the Phillips Hue app, which doesn't even support the swiping keyboard!

Hello! Thanks for your interest! Sadly, I think I will learn more if I do it for myself, but I will send you my list of ideas later the day. Maybe we could compare our games when they are done?
Can you give a quick summary of how all the parts work together? I'm guessing something like: HTML, CSS, and JS is used to run a web page; Dynamics handled by JS and presentation handled by HTML and CSS. AJAX and JQuery are how the web page communicates with the server. Flask runs on the server, and based on information sent by the web page, turns lights on and off. Sorry if this is a very basic question. I'm just starting to learn this stuff and still somewhat confused about how all the languages/frameworks/ends fit together.

I have been a python dev for 7 years, never came across these mistakes. Have you tried for a patent?😜
I think you pretty much got it. Flask is running on a server that can execute more complex tasks such as sending an RF signal to control his outlet. The HTML/JS/CSS is presentation, Ajax/jQuery/JS for communicating back and forth with the server.

"Undetectable" by who? Seems perfectly detectable to me. And no, your comments don't help anything.
Thank for your question, It is undetectable by all AV software except Kaspersky AV as you can see in this picture:[https://gyazo.com/527989ba04b2c5b1216b6f8499d8581e](https://gyazo.com/527989ba04b2c5b1216b6f8499d8581e), and I believe that the longer the base64 string is, the harder it is to get detected by antivirus but anyways at the end they are just comments which doesn't affect affect the program at all!
Nah man, forging credentials is never the way to go.
VirusTotal doesn't mean anything, it will get detected by any IDS or heuristic protection out there as soon as it starts doing anything weird. And no, that's not how any of this works.
Even just *some* security. The video I posted about the Tesla hacking was one of the more in depth hijacks I've seen. A lot of the generic garage door openers (and other similar systems) rely purely on people not sniffing the wireless communication.
A smartphone can transmit in those frequencies or you are connecting to something like an arduino with a RF transmitter? Awesome work nonetheless.
VirusTotal scans the file with many AVs out there and as you can see its not detected by almost all of them,I read that piece of information about longer base64 string in a book years ago, I may be wrong thanks for correcting me and again it wont make any difference to the script if I remove them!
Sorry I was having trouble describing what I was thinking but yes exactly this. I guess I didn't have my settings right, thanks for this!
&gt; Most people seem to prefer Poetry. Can you explain how you came to this conclusion? Pipenv has 17k stars on its github page, and Poetry only has 4.7k.
Most antivirus software no longer relies on passive scanning, which is what VirusTotal does - it relies on watching what programs do and blocking things that are suspicious. What you're doing is extremely _and_ obviously suspicious - or it would have been, if your code had actually _worked_ in the first place.
Any chance of a link to source code?
That's great man. I have a few of those outlets and was lagging on doing something like this. I can't wait for you to upload it on GitHub.
Compared to many payloads out there that i took a look at, they are more detectable and even my browser didnt allow me to install them even tho some of them were written in low level languages like go, so i decided to make my own and realized converting them to base64 makes it less detectable and if you have the right social engineering skills you can get it on your victims target easily, and yes it works just follow the steps in my repository and start listening to to the script before running it on the victims computer
It does not, in fact, work. Also, the reason "many payloads out there" are "more detectable" is because more skids like you used them and got them into antivirus databases. You can avoid passive scanner detection on any of those if you know what you're doing.

What you see is a web interface provided by a raspberry pi server. The server has an RF transmitter connected for this control
They also say they still use conda for most operations.
You pretty much hit the nail on the head. The RPi has a flask server running and I wrote HTML and CSS for the visual frontend element. Javascript is used for user functions like button presses.

I’ve used PyInstaller before. The .exe ended up being fairly large though for a small script
Thanks for the reply! Are you communicating through a database on the server, or are you talking to the Flask program directly?
Using Pyinstaller's `--onefile` bundles an entire Python intepreter, all dependencies, and your script into the final binary so yeah there's a good bit of overhead for small/simple scripts... But it works great and solves the OP's problem very easily.
How do you pull out of the code jam once you've applied? I didn't realise the level of time commitment that would be expected.
I automatically detect the waveform characteristics. There's four values to be aware of: - High time for a 1 (~150 us) - Low time for a 1 (~500 us) - High time for a 0 (~480 us) - Low time for a 0 (~170 us) - Interval between codes (~5.2 ms) I suspect they vary between manufacturers. That's why I auto-detect the codes
True, I guess it could be considered a “quick and dirty” method
Talking to flask directly, although you could realistically use a database. I'm storing so little data I decided to not overly complicate things with a database
/r/learnpython will probably be a better resource for you.

Probably not what you meant but if you were referring to pip as in the command line tool it comes packaged with python. Just go to the search bar and type cmd, then in the command prompt type pip install {package name}. If you’re using python 3 then do the same but type pip3 instead of pip.

Geez must be nice to be so good. I didn't even include the one where I forget to put parentheses after methods with no arguments as if they were attributes. Collections.Counter.most_common() is a frequent victim of these, it just really looks like an attributes to me.
Did you use the -f option (might be different now, it's been a while) to include all dependencies in the exe? Option should be called something like "single file" or similar. If you did this, there are a few other troubleshooting steps you can take. Let me know.
How did you compile python into an exe file? I thought it was only possible in fairy tales
Pretty sure it's just about performance, basically using the \*args approach does lazy evaluation for the string formatting. Which should be negligible in most cases so calling it "wrong" is, well, wrong.
Hahaha, probably pyinstaller, tried it, works well... I heard also py2exe, havent tried it

Also generating classes.. whatever that formatting is .. type('NewClassname', (object,), {'classvar': 4}) I guess that's more stuff you just rarely use.. oh setting up logging module's base config I never remember. Oh and I use collection's namedtuple and OrderedDict a bunch, but very often I get confused by them.. why is one all lower case and one camel case?
Not quite sure how to phrase this and not get myself into legal trouble, but I'm going to take a shot anyways because I was open to react and now I'm very much not. There are good reasons for the community at large to not use react. Aside from the standard set of reasons: - Documentation is poor and frequently inaccurate for beginners - Licensing is problematic - There's an endless set of rabbit holes where you can get lost wasting time trying to do something you saw in an outdated tutorial project - The ROI for the time you spend trying to use it vs. productivity of actual development is poor There are many other reasons that you don't have to think too hard to figure out: - It was developed for Facebook to solve Facebook's problems - It's maintained by Facebook and their environment comes first - Facebook's environment is very different than most - Facebook's intentions are probably questionable given their history - The good ideas in react don't require all that much effort to take advantage of without using react - Facebook's idea of good web design is abysmal - Facebook seems to care very little about battery life and bandwidth with their products as a whole and that might be reflected in the framework and component libraries. - Come to think of it, security and privacy are probably concerns as well. I don't know off the top of my head how that could be exposed... - Facebook seems to be getting a lot of credit for this "great framework" that is a shell around all kinds of open source development that didn't come from there. I mean... those are just some conclusions that someone might come to if they thought about things for a little bit. But those are mostly derided with "wow you really don't like Facebook" and conspiracy-theorist bullshit. I do have a lot of good reasons for not recommending react to people and pushing others away from it. Unfortunately I don't feel all that comfortable going into detail because of a financial penalty associated with a confidentiality agreement.
Cx freeze perhaps. That's what i use
I did use pyinstaller, although with vpython, the 3D library I was using, I had to do a bunch of extra stuff. Pyinstaller isn't perfect, some libraries don't play nicely.
Wait, from X import * is strongly discouraged? I thought that was the standard
You probably need to add pip to your path. Here’s a video of how to do that https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UTUlp6L2zkw
Step 1. Start a github project. Step 2. You write good, clean code. Step 3. Submit github links with job application. Step 4. Profit. Honestly most of the job postings I'm interested in (from employers who seem to know what they're asking for) ask for github links. Make sure your github has something in it. Then you can use it as basically a resume.
did you just say "Cx"?
The last paragraph sounds like /r/thathappened material

A build tool for data science pipelines. It versions your data and code and only reruns the necessary parts of the pipeline potentially saving huge amounts of computation. [https://github.com/prodmodel/prodmodel](https://github.com/prodmodel/prodmodel)
This is really cool. I just started making a very basic game in python, I hope to get where you are in the next six months or so. I will be sure to study your code while I am at it.
This is not related to scoping, but seeing your example made me think of a place I constantly fall down: #Let's iterate over a list In [1]: for x in ["foo", "bar"]: print(x) foo bar #Ok, I don't need bar so let's remove it In [2]: for x in ["foo"]: print(x) foo #Same thing, but let's use a tuple this time In [3]: for x in ("foo", "bar"): print(x) foo bar #Oh right, I still don't need bar In [4]: for x in ("foo"): print(x) f o o # This style is safe for lists and tuples In [5]: for x in ("foo",): print(x) foo
Thanks for the compliment! This took me 2-3 weeks to make, about an hour a day. I didn't find it that hard honestly, and this was the first game I made in python. Good luck for you with your game, I hope to play it sometime!
Not to put OP down or anything (this is a great learning project) - there's a full featured version of this exact thing available as Home Assistant (https://www.home-assistant.io). It's also open source/MIT and written in Python. :) If you were to do this yourself, it would probably be better to go with that.
Dm me bro, I got something good I'm working on and I could use some extrahands
r/Python is not the subreddit for this. More simple errors you could find just by google search. however I advise to go to r/learnpython
Very impressive! Great job.
3 weeks! Maybe I am not giving myself enough credit..LOL. I think I am going to take a look at my game and see if I can make it more interesting. I am feeling a little inspired now. :)
Good choice. Python is a great language and it's easy to pick up. Make sure you set up a good IDE and master it (Visual Studio Code is awesome). Have a linter installed to help you follow Python conventions. When you're comfortable with the basics, experiment and learn more advanced stuff: sequence slicing, list comprehensions, generators, decorators etc.
Thanks! Pyinstaller, noted!
Noted, thanks!
Thanks
What is the linter?
I can't believe this doesn't include "forgetting to type `.items()` when iterating over a `dict`" I don't think I've *ever* wanted to iterate over just the keys of a dictionary.
It usually comes as a plugin you can install on popular IDEs. It helps you make your code compatible with Python conventions as described in PEP Style Guide (just google it). It includes things like naming variables, code line length, proper indentation etc. These might seem insignificant at first, but without a common style guide it will be hard for devs to read each others code.
https://realpython.com is pretty good, and a linter is a program that will read through your code and suggests ways to clean it up. If you install vs code I’m pretty sure it has a python linter in the extensions store.
Build yourself a cookbook of snippets for reference. Write tutorials to learn yourself. I have found beginners learn best from other beginners. I have trouble relating to beginners because I have long forgotten how it felt.
[The official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) has some really good examples to get you started and provides an introduction to the basics (conditions/loops/functions), object-oriented programming, and a brief overview of the standard library (re, datetime, zlib, etc.). [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/) is another good website and [Corey Schafer](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU) has some excellent videos. Also, if you ever need to know more about something in Python, it has a built-in help function. Just type `help(object)` in the IDE and it will generally provide you with an overview and even an example for some objects and modules. # Help with a class. help(int) # Help with an object. x = 5 help(x) # Help with a function (note the lack of parentheses after the function name). help(print) # Help with a module. import re help(re)
Would you be open to explaining where the fourth dimension fits in? I only see three of them. I'd be interested in hearing about some implementation of a fourth dimension.

Learning happens much faster when there is juice the game. Keep learning and never look back.
I think I speak for everyone here when I say: that's pretty freakin sweet my dude!
Do you have a github repo?
Good suggestion. Will do.
 [https://github.com/anonamause10/4D-chess](https://github.com/anonamause10/4D-chess)
Try `for x in (“foo”,)` - that way you cast it as a tuple. `(“foo”)` is actually just a string.
Actually, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wFQPSEPgWc) video does a great job explaining it(it was my inspiration for the project in the first place). Essentially, each of the stacks of chessboards represents 1 spot in the fourth dimension. Just as moving left and right, forward and back, and up and down is a movement in one direction, moving to the next stack represents a movement in the fourth dimension. Obviously we humans can't visualize the 4th dimension, so this is the best we can do.
I'll check it out, thanks!
I'm trying to use Google's OR-Tools to build a script to assign ten workers to twenty jobs with a bunch of constraints. The documentation is pretty poor so it's been a lot of trial and error to work out what all the example pieces do.

&gt; When a few enough cards remain, I can tell you what they are without even looking at them. ... Proceeds to say them in the exact order they actually appear at the bottom of the deck too. All teasing aside, nice program and video. There are some pretty impressive full HD glasses that can [stream video like this one](https://www.amazon.com/Live-Streaming-Glasses-Camera-Full/dp/B07RQ1F4WX/ref=sr_1_14?keywords=glasses+wifi&amp;qid=1560309291&amp;s=photo&amp;sr=1-14), but I don't know how many of them would actually get past someone looking out for that kind of thing. I've heard of people hiding stuff up their sleeves, but the viewing angle would be bad and making sure it gets a glimpse of all the cards around the table would be awkward.
What kind of coding do you like to do? What' preventing you from obtaining a degree in engineering of physics?
Haha that was pure luck! I only looked at the computer monitor showing RAIN MAN's interface. I smiled when I set them down because they happened to be in the exact order I said them. It did require several takes to get that shot right. Hmm I'll have to check those glasses out!

God yes. IIRC Raymond Hettinger once mentioned in a talk that Guido asked the core developers what the default behaviour of dict iteration should be: keys only, or (key, val) pairs. IMO they chose wrong.
That doesn't mean it's a good idea.
Started coding in about 2 years ago in school, for AP Comp Sci. Since that's only Java, I started learning python in December last year.

/r/learnpython is the place to go. &amp;#x200B; do you have this in your dag definition file? \`\`\`from airflow import DAG\`\`\` &amp;#x200B; Can you double check if your schedule is properly supported? &amp;#x200B; If the dag appears in \`airflow list\_dags\`, but not on the UI, it's likely an issue with the webserver.
Personally I recommend to take the python docs (free) go through language reference, syntax, build-in modules and experiment with them step by step. Really try to understand (I used to skip things, bc I am inpatient). Use the python interpreter (free) or the jupyter notebook (free) to test and recreate the examples. No copy and paste! After that start reading one of the many free python ebooks (google is your friend) and try to develop simple programs for things you are interested in (eg automate something at work). Then go slowly more complex. Works for me, maybe it makes sense for you too. Cheers!
there are a a good bit of free resources: 1) [automate the boring stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter1/), cons: the author uses camelCase, instead of the conventional snake\_case, just something to keep in mind 2) [learn python in one video - derek banas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4mEzFDjqtA), faster pasted, but quicker to get to the point, cons: not the most up-to-date with newer python versions 3) [learn to program - derek banas](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGLfVvz_LVvTn3cK5e6LjhgGiSeVlIRwt) cons: slower paced, but a reasonable pace 4) [python 3 basic tutorial series - senddex](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDe8XSftW-RAxdo6OmaeL85M) cons: never really watched it myself, so idk &amp;#x200B; extras: [real python](https://realpython.com/) \- blog-like site, has a email news letter that is actually good IMO, also answers fan questions in the news letter, not as beginner oriented as the other linked resources, but a nice resource IMO
I’m with you on the poor documentation for this! For this kind of tools for a project I ended up using [PuLP](https://pythonhosted.org/PuLP/). Also, depending on the complexity of your requirements, you might find [pyschedule](https://github.com/timnon/pyschedule) useful.
I use Vscode with flake8 linter, it has auto code completion, git integration and other nice set of features to it.
auto-py-to-exe shows references to pyinstaller. Seems like a GUI wrapped around pyinstaller. Pyinstaller is fairly easy to use. Might be easier to use it directly

And `str.index` is less error-prone than `str.find`: it raises if it doesn't find, rather than return a sentinel (and not just a sentinel, a valid index!).
As a python newcommer who can barely setup his own web server, I'm fuckin impressed. Really nice work!
I do it semi-regularly, but god would it be way more convenient if (k, v) was the default result of iterating on a dict. I'm quite happy Rust implemented it correctly.
I guess It's totally okay to leave it as it is since the main info is in the beginning of the article. Also it would be great to mention TestPyPi. https://packaging.python.org/guides/using-testpypi/
&gt; Because you can make your .py script run a (tiny, tiny) bit faster by making it skip assertions by typing, e.g. python -O myscript.py at the terminal. I'm oft tempted to just refuse running under `-O` (let alone `-OO`), the only thing it does is harm.

i asked on reddit, checked them both myself, and came to the conclusion that the motivations are both technical and human. poetry felt really reliable and well implemented and a full solution to packaging both as a user and as a developer. pipenv only does env management and according to reports it is buggy and slow. also Kenneth Reitz is apparently rejected by the community which could lead to a boycott no matter how pipenv is working. poetry is younger so i am not surprised it has less stars, but the feedback of my post reported that many people didn't know it existed and stormed to it.
&gt;I do semi-regularly iterate over dict keys, but god would it be way more convenient if (k, v) was the default. Yeah, especially as dict.keys() exists and is more expressive anyway in my opinion. Though I constantly forget the parentheses...
I think the mathematics and calculations should be fairly accurate. I don't think DJI would release a product without confirming the math first 😂
You sound absolutely unbearable and insincere. I'm sure I'll get down voted for this because everyone wants to pretend to be perfect on here but if you spoke like that to me irl it would sound transparently condescending.
Cx is a smiley face
no, I mean like on the whiteboard? did they just write some crap or is it legit? I might be mistaken and that might as well be just what you answered but I kinda got confused... ^^^^^^^^sorry ^^^^^^^^for ^^^^^^^^the ^^^^^^^^inconvenience ^^^^^^^^:)
In what world
The one on the whiteboard? The first half is just talking about bodys being slowed down by friction. I have a hard time reading the lower part, but there is some calculation with circles. Seems pretty legit.
Do not criticise our lord and saviour, Donald Trump! - API test
Bruuh, did you read the first word in the title of the game? There's a VAST difference between Snake and 4D chess
shit dude, fucking google it
No, the friction isn't about being slowed. It is about the centripetal force needing to be lower than the friction force so that the robot doesn't slide and lose grip during the hard turn. I'm not sure the whiteboard is right though. The acceleration in the distance equation (right at the top) isn't the same acceleration as the centripetal acceleration (stated in the following equations).
The C is the mouth and x are the eyes Think xD Then think (x Then think Cx
Any update? XD
Because JSON is not specified by the Python project and provides a strict and limited set of data types. Any datatype which doesn't directly fit into these will error out by default. It's up to applications to decide how they want to exchange UUIDs, as that requires e.g. cooperation of the other side of the exchange.
Are assert statements particularly slow? Or is the AssertionError recommendation just a fail safe to prevent people skipping assert statements?
Maybe https://github.com/cool-RR/PySnooper can help? or https://docs.python.org/2/library/trace.html
Best advice I can give is that you have a go at some free online tutorials (like http://automatetheboringstuff.com/) and then get stuck into some of your own projects. Doing my own projects is where I learn the most. I've worked on a program launcher for my computer so I can start multiple programs with one click, a basic webscraper, a link checker for a website at work, and am currently trying to build a personal webpage with Flask. All for free!
Can you not use pdb.set\_trace() inside your test?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but UUIDs aren't part of the JSON specifications. So how do you expect UUIDs to be serialized in order to diferentiate them from all the other datatypes?
RemindMe! 1 month "check github page"
New to Python so pretty simple things, I've got a couple of scripts which I run to do some DNS lookups and pings to check the entry is still valid along with another which just pings a list of IPs to see if they are active. Data is imported from a CSV and saved to another. &amp;#x200B; My current hope is to learn how to run multiple threads to cut down the time it takes these scripts to run.
Can this also run under linux?
I don't have a Linux build or any experience building for Linux, but the source code is [here](https://github.com/anonamause10/4D-chess)
Where does it show any python? I can see a scratch-like environment there
Is this homework? Because if not, that's not a thing you should do, ever, _ever_.

beautiful stuff. have an upvote
Look up the series of talks about "writing drivers in high level languages" or smth like that. They've among other things written a NIC userspace driver in Python (it was a masters Thesis at the TUM iirc) But honestly I don't think that's a really great idea
with --onefile the startup time increases....
I think it depends on circumstances as to whether you should use --onefile. For me, a quick, dirty and simple method worked best
I saw the comment about the year issue. Am I missing something or does 8 = 7 now? The title contains "8 stupid things" and the URL contains "[/eight\_stupid\_things/](https://www.prooffreader.com/2019/06/11/eight_stupid_things/)" but the article's title is "7 stupid things ..." and only contains seven things.
Working on automating part of my workflow with jinja2 templates to build out boilerplate for a lot of the code I write.
Look into sockets and scapy but what you're talking about doing here is a difficult task to do securely. For the router, I'd start out with a raspberry pi and build from there. Should give you everything you need to tinker in a lab and build your python protocol. Keep in mind though, a network built on a protocol implemented in python may not be as performant as you might hope. All of this together should solidify that this would be academic research and not the basis of a viable product. Either way, good luck!
If you don't mind the user seeing your source code, try [pyvan](https://github.com/ClimenteA/pyvan). You can convert the .bat file resulted into an .exe (if the .bat bothers you)
Probably get a string representation of the UUIDs like how I do it already when I need to serialise them
Make the app in Flask, use [flaskwebgui](https://github.com/ClimenteA/flaskwebgui) to fake a GUI with chrome and [pyvan](https://github.com/ClimenteA/pyvan) to distribute it to other PC's with no python installed (alternative to Pyinstaller, cx\_freeze)
AHHH! IT'S VISUAL CODE!
Just use str(uuidX()). Works the same as ObjectIds in a mongoDB. You can pass It as a string and it will work the same.
I runaway from QT world just because it gets pretty complicated to do simple stuff and very complicated to do complex stuff.. I don't know if you must use PySide, but if you don't try [flaskwebgui](https://github.com/ClimenteA/flaskwebgui) (convert flask web app to desktop app) and [pyvan](https://github.com/ClimenteA/pyvan) (freeze/make it a standalone desktop app)
All I meant was that I should have higher standards for myself. No need to be a condescending jerk about it.
For a few days, [The online video course for the book "Automate the Boring Stuff" is free online](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/bz3rxv/the_online_course_for_automate_the_boring_stuff/). The original book is also free online.
This seams cool but why is it published in /r/python ?
Nice article, very well explained :) I found it more easy for me to make the gui in html/css/js with Flask made a small script [**flaskwebgui**](https://github.com/ClimenteA/flaskwebgui) which converts it to a desktop app (by using chrome in app mode) and [**pyvan**](https://github.com/ClimenteA/pyvan) to freeze/make it a standalone desktop application.

I think you are correct. It's such a micro optimization that I doubt it matters except for some super rare cases where you log every loop but who does that? I personally think readability is much more important here than this absurd micro optimization.

what path does `which pip3` give you as non-root? This is probably nothing more than a PATH issue
Seems like a bunch of typos really those aren't really mistakes. Nevertheless with 18 experience anything more than these typos are unlikely, that's a lot of python! In my 8 years of python the biggest mistakes I still make is not using itertools or collections as much as i could. I often write something and then be like - wait a second there's already something in stdlib that is very similar! Same thing goes for often being out of touch with already available solutions on pypi.
Because you can program it in Python, as shown near 1:54.
It's flattened into 3D for visualization purposes, but it's really 4D. (Like if someone laid out all the individual planes in 3D chess on a single tabletop -- it would be flattened into 2D, but the *behavior of the game* would still be 3D.)
Pip3 for non root is in /usr/bin I am using root for pip3 as On non root user for a python process all my inodes are full No, i am not using any environment management tool
matplotlib. I have tinkered with it for a long time always winging it, but now I am focused on really learning it.
cool, what are you using for maps, google or openstreetmap?
This is very cool... now for the real question, any ideas on how to compile for Android/iOS??
ok, so you would need to make sure `/usr/bin` is on root's path. Then it should find it.
I started a few lessons last night and this online course is amazing. I can't recommend it enough.
Convincing my girlfriend letting me get one right now for "educational" purpose 🤣
nvm, Fixed
Did you Google first? You didnt set read for file2
I've put "a+" for file2 and it worked.
This. I feel that not enough developers realize that you can debug unit tests like regular code ... -chronodekar
I would use `r+` instead of `a+` and use some type of error-handling in the event that `file2` doesn’t exist, as `a+` will create the file if it doesn’t exist and it seems like you’re assuming the file should exist beforehand. This question should also probably be in /r/learnpython.
neither are dates. welcome to software development. :)
What’s the frontend ?
Bootstrap
\&gt; Besides Python, is there another language that is said to be like Lisp (Common Lisp, Scheme, ...) ? &amp;#x200B; Lisp like/Inspired By ... Ruby was inspired by Lisp [http://www.randomhacks.net/2005/12/03/why-ruby-is-an-acceptable-lisp/](http://www.randomhacks.net/2005/12/03/why-ruby-is-an-acceptable-lisp/) and javascript was intended to be like scheme in the browser but it got complicated [https://brendaneich.com/2008/04/popularity/](https://brendaneich.com/2008/04/popularity/) i personally dont think ruby or python or javascript are very lisp like. I like that \`code is data is code\` idea and only lisp does it as elegantly as lisp.
not enough info
Python is a tool that I believe just about any discipline can utilize. Whatever your job is, try to find a way to use python.
No you don't need a degree, but you need to compensate lack of degree by showing you know your stuff. Implementing a fully working web service (eg Python + Django) would be a good start. Preferably make a few projects. Read lot of books too, to make sure you don't learn things completely wrong.
Why wouldn't it be?
Good Work. Don't put the `venv` in a repo. I personally also don't recommend putting `.idea` to git as well. You can generate a `.gitignore` from https://gitignore.io/
Because you now have state that's partially tracked by one package manager, and partially tracked by another, and the two are incompatible.
Yeah one of the stupid things only occurred in Python 2 and was fixed in Python 3 and I saw unaware of it, so when that was pointed out to me I just got rid of it. No way to edit titles in Reddit. Call it off-by-one error!
Update: got my 'play random music from a predefined playlist until told otherwise' functionality working last night. Amazingly, it worked on the first test run. I'm sort of unreasonably pleased by this =)
I don't know of any real speed difference, the raise AssertionError is so that people will continue to due asserts when necessary but remove the danger if the end user runs the CPython interpreter in Optimized mode, which skips all bare asserts
Cool thank you I'd like that!
