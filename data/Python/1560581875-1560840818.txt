C'mon, you could have hella fun writing a game. It's not easy to optimize with Python, esp. with pygame (which uses the bad ole SDLv1), but it's pretty much as entertaining as playing a RPG, seeing the progress of your game day by day. BTW I've been experimenting with ModernGL, on which the OpenGL bindings are grouped together in the C++ back-end which allows reaching a few hundred FPS for 3D rendering on full HD easily on my intel graphics. I agree that if the logic is too heavy that needed to be written in C, Lua binding is a lot less painful to write tho.
I actually like https://thonny.org/ Light weight and gets you started with the basics https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/thonny/ And pycharm for the heavy lifting
git link?
 git: 'link' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.
Jupyter or spyder. You should install \[Anaconda\]( [https://www.anaconda.com/](https://www.anaconda.com/)). These IDEs come pre-installed with Anaconda distribution and also many popular data science libraries like numpy and scipy.
pygame?
App is good, but many people don't like the idea of adding finished applications to pip / npm / whatever.

Honestly, people still prefer to ask their python questions here because r/learnpython sucks. 1) The posters on r/learnpython are trite and frequently post unPythonic solutions, or solutions that are just flat out wrong 2) r/learnpython still promotes shit websites like CodingBat as good resources even though r/python removed CodingBat from their sidebar months ago for being such a poor python learning resource I just posted on r/learnpython that they should remove CodingBat from their wiki just like r/python did because CodingBat teaches unPythonic habits and is full of vague, poorly thought out exercises that read like the author is still learning Python themselves, and most of the replies to my post are people exclaiming CodingBat is aMaZiNg for Python, but that people just don't know how to understand their ambiguity like wtf lol
I also wanted to say that splitting subs into multiple factions is ruining reddit because there is no inclusiveness. I mean go to the search bar and type in programmer or programming and you get like 20 results like: r\\programmers r\\programming r\\programmernews r\\programminghorror r\\programmerhumor r\\learnprogramming It's horrible because the entire community gets split up and it's never super active in either one sub because of such strict content type posting rules. I think there should exist one sub for every subject, with tags for every type of post. Sometimes people post python questions that invoke serious thought, but not much discussion is ever had because it gets removed and people are told to post it on r/learnpython where it's not super active all the time. Then that other poster in this thread saying he thinks r/python should only be about python news is absurd. If that was the case, this sub would have almost zero content 24/7 because news directly related to python isn't some 24 hour news cycle lol.
PyCharm ist pretty great for everybody. It is packed with features for advanced users, but you don't have to use them all, just pick them up as you go. Having syntax highlighting and being able to click through to find definitions makes programming a whole lot easier.

The difficult part will be building up a dataset of images.
python is slow, making another version in C or C++, improve that, and make that open source and free, then encourage others to make open source and free games. or just add some health, ammo, shield, etc. this one is easier.
It must be just a fun project you're making (I assume), BUT, if you're planing something serious, it would be totally awesome to turn it into multiplayer, new maps, maybe type of tiles (icy ones, etc) and make it f2p not p2w. Don't skip the last part, is the most important one! Good luck :D
So cool! thanks you to sharing it with us. &amp;#x200B; I never put anything on Pypi yet. But your project inspire me !!
Do you know how to do multiline select in your editor? Using combinations of cmd, alt, shift left and right you can do all of these in like 4 or 5 key presses, or anything else really.

Building a program that can process Excel worksheets and read and reply back to Outlook emails quickly. My company has tons of administrative emails flooding in and it’s an increasing chore to always “cross-reference” and to spend countless hours just to reply back to twenty clients. We have tons of clients so, this will definitely shave off lots of time. I’ve managed to get the Excel information that I required, although I am currently stuck with Outlook emails and connecting with them. Company’s nice enough to let me do this “work” during office hours.
Looks good. What do you expect to get?
OK this took me a while as well, and I thought I was quite the regex guru :) &amp;#x200B; The fourth argument to sub isn't the flags, it's the count.

Doki Doki literature club is written in python using the RenPy engine
Look into Google Apps Script to do so.
Why?
Don't give up. Keep up the good work.
Oh. Thanks. My bad.
any way to do it in console?
Try to use Google API’s, you can probably get the blob of an image, then create a docs file with thar blob. But I don’t really understand what you want to do

This is the first time I heard of it :( There are lot of useful apps in PyPI asciinema, rtv and orange3 to name a few. Can you give me some reference to why people don't like it? From PyPI: The Python Package Index (PyPI) is a repository of **software** for the Python programming language.
Thanks man :)
What I was saying is that if he liked the syntax of python and how much it's easy to use, using LOVE would be better than python. And then when he will understand how much it's difficult to do game with python, he will turn to game engines that are the best solutions or to pl a little bit more low level.
The only thing I can think of is that you should *first* try to go through the package management system for your OS, as they're often more secure and audited. However, they're incredibly slow to get updates sometimes (STFU, Arch [btw I use Arch]).
RenPy is not powerful tho. It's just for point and click games and visual novels. It doesn't require much power to do it so it's fine. But when we do physics or want to store multiple objects or want to do 3D or whatever that is on a canvas with position changing, collision objects, shaders etc.. It's too much for python to manage.
U R TALKIN LIEK DIS. MAYBE I SHUD TALK LIEK DIS 2.
Cool!! Is making a command (your app) available easy? Would love to see a good explanation with best practices on that :)
If you're new to game creating just use an engine such as Unity, Unreal, Godot, Game maker studio.... You will understand the logic behind everything in game design while following some tutorials in the net and also learn some basic programming logic. If you want to do everything from scratch then use java, it's easier then Cpp, got a better documentation than Rust, and is the highest level from python. PS Godot use a built in pl, named gdscript that is basically python with godot.

Do you know why BeautifulSoup is adding it as a Separate Element in a list (I believe string stripping usually removes these before creating the Childrens object)
Because they're part of the document. "String stripping" never happens.

You MUST use placeholders in your SQL statements - NEVER use string interpolation ('{blah}'.format(), '%s' % (blah), or even f'{blah}') as it can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. Each SQL database driver can do it a different way, but SQLite uses "question mark" place holders, so you can say: c.execute('select blah, blahbla from sometable where oojit=? and thingy &gt;?', ('foo',10)) That way if your input values contain syntactically relevant punctuation, and fragments of SQL commands, they will be treated like *values* and not *SQL commands*. What would happen if someone provided something like "blah'); drop table entry;"?

I am building a simple price comparison engine to help my wife wife when the price drop happens. &amp;#x200B; We spend 400+ USD last week on shopping, I thought this simple python script might help me save money. &amp;#x200B; I use python 3.7, pip to install packages and using beautifulsoup4.
I knew about script before, and its really useful, however in bigger projects i require way more terminal space, and input working aswell, is there a way to run a python script (or any other language) in a terminal outside of atom? that would be game changing for me.
Good catch. It doesn't work for legacy Python (2.x).
It wasn't mentioned on readme so. Cool app btw. Works perfectly on phone.
&gt;phoenixcharm Updated README.rst on github :)
Also, I don't get sound on phone.
Eh, let the distro package it if they want to. I think it’s not reasonable to expect developers to go through the hurdle of getting stuff into their repos (and by that I don’t mean creating a deb or rpm; I mean creating one that satisfies the standards for inclusion. That’s much harder)
This was my first thought too. Even before I hit play.
Perspective of the average developer: I'm lazy. I don't want to go package an rpm, deb, apk, PKGBUILD, and every other system when I can just say "hey use this program you probably already have to install it". I'll do what I can for security but when it stops being convenient, I'm more likely to just offer one way to do it and hope the distro maintainers know how to port it which, at this point in Python's lifetime, shouldn't be that far off.
I'm assuming you refer to column selection. Column selection does not help when variable names are varying lengths i.e. = are not aligned.
Usually holding alt in most editors (and even stuff like chrome etc) allows you to step through units of text, ie. Whole words. So multi select a few rows and align the cursors at the left with cmd+left, and then shift + alt + right should highlight the first variable name no matter what size. You can copy and paste into multiple rows as well. Alt is very useful for more powerful multicolumn editing.
does **sudo pip install --upgrade pip** not work?
It upgrades pip, but when checking the pip version, it still returns python 3.4.
Could you please tell me how exactly you are running and installing it? If you are running it on Android terminal, not sure if gobject supports it. :( &amp;#x200B; Thanks for taking time to test and report it :)
I'm running on Kali Terminal via UserLAnd.
Hmm.. I see. Makes sense for popular distros of Linux, But, How do I do it for OSX without buying a Mac?
That's my point - using the language package manager means that you don't have to rely on packaging for systems you can't afford to test on. Do what you can to get it into distros but IMO don't put too much effort into it.
It seems to be relatively easy, I've been writing a lot of scientific code and have recently started needing to bring together separate projects into one. I found the best way to do this was actually to create packages and then install them through pip / github. I haven't uploaded anything on PyPi but I don't think it's much more difficult. I just followed this: https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

**Tools of the trade** * Prompt toolkit - For text user interfaces, interactive prompts * argparse - Built in argument parser * docopt - Document comment based argument parser * click - Annotation based argument parser * Poetry - packaging with pyproject.toml (some compatibility issue with latest pip) * setuptools - packaging that worked for me, very easy to understand documentation * Twine - uploading to PyPI I'm using `prompt-toolkit` for the text UI, but there are tons of argument parser like argparse (builtin), click, docopt, etc. Writing a `setup.py` can be challenging, poetry seems to be the new alternative (but I couldn't get it working with the new pip).
&gt; Make health, ammo, shield, etc. attributes for each tank. Easy. &gt; Throw it up on a server and implement multiplayer games with public lobbies. Not easy.
Again, that is far more work than selecting all fields of the class at once. Besides the selection is only half the process, you would still need regex search and replace to produce the results. Sure you can do the same things as those scripts by eg IDE macros you would still need to implement those macros as well.

That doesn't clean the page, that just specifies the parser you're using. There's a myriad of ways to clean it up beforehand, but if you know an empty line is getting added to the list it may be easiest to just clean the list after parsing with a filter or list comprehension.
It might work if you install pygobject, However you will need to follow this https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#ubuntu-getting-started But I'm not entirely sure.
Send nude code.
LÖVE seems really promising, but what is pl? Though, as I mentioned, it is not struggling at all to write a 3D game in Python from scratch. Yes, optimization might be more difficult, but numeric libraries (numpy, pyrr) plays really well with high level/functional routines, which make logic and world building a paradise.
Waaalll paper...
So python3 -V shows 3.6 but pip -V shows (python3.4)? I did it on a vm with 18.04 3.6.8 to 3.7.3 and it worked when I installed pip with apt-get.
This week I've ported Oracle scripts to Python for a more user-friendly data refresh procedure that can be performed by anyone so that I am no longer a single point of failure and can take PTO when I need to, etc. Because upstream data table source keys are created by humans and don't a predictable convention, the refresh process cannot be fully automated. The upstream data source keys are communicated via email from IT at load time so the keys need to be manually input at the time of the refresh. Yesterday, this involved manually updating a crosswalk which contained the upstream source data keys and also manually updating a 'run\_type' parameter in the Oracle script. Today with Python, the user is now prompted for these parameters and the program does the rest. The program is also able to give the user more real-time intermediate progress status and any warnings which the Oracle script is not able to do. &amp;#x200B; My second project this week involved automating production of an Excel-based report from data in Oracle using XlsxWriter. While we have more advanced BI tools like Tableau, Excel is going anywhere soon and people continue to manually create reports in Excel, often literally copying and pasting data from other sources into a sheet and manually updating pivot tables, etc. There are several reasons Excel won't be going anywhere soon. One is that management won't take kindly to changing the look of a report that they are used to. Another is that business areas aren't hassled by IT about how they use Excel like they are regarding how they are building back end data and what not. &amp;#x200B; To me, Tableau is just Excel with benefits. But to IT and some analytical groups, it's anarchy that threatens the business and if someone doesn't gain control over it then the whole company is at risk. Meanwhile, conflicting data is growing uncontrollably in millions of Excel files across the company, etc. But I digress... &amp;#x200B; What Python allows me to do is encourage people to migrate to more reliable and consistent data sources that I produce in-house while maintaining both the format and control and 'security blanket' of Excel. The ability to populate cells with calculations helps immensely with this and also allows users to continue to understand the data in the cells. It's great and I'm very excited about it because I've been preaching the benefits of using my back end for research, etc. but people can't give up their Excel and now they don't have to. I can automate things that they no longer want to repetitively create...I can give C-level executives what they are use to seeing...I can increase the reliability/consistency/timeliness of data...and I can have great nerd fun doing it all while further securing my job.
I'm not quite sure why you need regex at all? All of your examples can be done with column selection and a few presses of alt shift ctrl+c ctrl+v, no macros required it's standard editor work. Try out it's very flexible.
&gt; I am not here to say that Django is crap and that Masonite is the best thing in the entire world Remove this profane dig from your article. It is unnecessary and puts you, your framework, and the Python community in a bad light.
Don't trust that guy about the Java thing. As an end-user, I never care about the language used to build the software, but every Java program has the start-up time bugging the shit out of me. I mean, if the idiotically verbose syntax didn't scare you off already. If you can maintain discipline, C++ would benefit you and your users a lot more.
How? I’m not here to say that? How is it a profane dog? I said I am not here to say Django is crap? Django is not crap. How is that a dig at Django?
I like it. Reminds me of when I started coding and I enjoyed the little things instead of now where In always trying to work on months long complex projects.
Great point actually, as you can install directly from github, correct?
Great overview!
To be fair, the reactions you got to [that post](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/c0u57g/petition_to_remove_codingbat_from_the_wiki/) were because your solution was incorrect and because of how you behaved in the comments. As to your points: 1. r/learnpython has many experienced developers taking time out to answer questions and there are many correct, pythonic answers to be found. r/learnpython also has many python beginners who are excited about learning python and helping others learn and there are many answers that aren't quite correct or that aren't the most pythonic, but they generally get corrected in the end by the experienced python developers. I see this as a feature, not a bug. If you get one answer and you think it's great, but then other folks correct the answer, it teaches several people how to do things correctly *and* it exposes why pythonic solutions are preferred. 2. Your point about coding bat comes off as salty because of your recent, poorly regarded post that I linked to above. I've just tried CodingBat for the first time and I find it to be okay. Not stupendous, not "shit" either. I'll leave it to the reader to decide if your post, linked above, is as you describe it to be.
Man what an awesome application you wrote there. This made me smile. Thanks
I lit up! Awesome job!
I don’t see why. There are thousands of finished applications on PyPI, including pip itself! In fact [pipx](https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx)’s sole purpose is to let you safely install and manage Python packages that act as finished applications.
KA-CHOW!
Yeah...I do not see how that is profane nor a dig.
Been wanting to do something like this for a while now... &amp;#x200B; This is way better than what I was going to do!
This is day one of Python for me. Hoping to create some...thing that can scrape IMDb or TMDb and output to html with a poster and description of a movie. Not for any practical purpose, just to give me focus on something. I have no idea what I'm doing.
You many want to remove the beta warning in [What's New](https://docs.masoniteproject.com/v/v2.2/whats-new/masonite-2.2) page :)
Haha good idea :)
Try using Pyomo? I liked it better than PuLP.
`def selection_sort(list1):` `for i in range(n-1):` `min_value = list1[i]` `k = i` `for j in range(i+1, n):` `if min_value &gt; list1[j]:` `min_value = list1[j]` `k = j` `list1[i], list1[k] = list1[k], list1[i]` `list1 = [11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 1, 1, 1, 1, 11]` `n = len(list1)` `selection_sort(list1)` `print(list1)` `list2 = [10,9,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,-5,-20,100,200]` `n = len(list2)` `selection_sort(list2)` `print(list2)` Hope this help you. The problem is if we have a array like \[1,1,1,1,1,1\] if we input array.index(1) it always return 0
You made my day. Show us the source code!
So you wanna make it open source, have volunteers work on it, and pull it from open source to make profit for yourself? https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditForDesktop/comments/c0v7b9/what_is_reddit_for_desktop_and_how_you_can/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ios_share_flow_optimization&amp;utm_term=control_1
Hey, it more reliable than Microsoft Excel right? You got that going for you!
So there are a couple of things you have misunderstood. 1. This app is, and will always be, free. I won't fathom making this app paid because no one will buy it. As I said, I'm a programming **hobbyist**, not professional. I don't possess the resource, skill nor time to make a fully fledged App that is worth people's money. BTW I don't know how to get paid on Ads so please don't start. 2. I don't expect people to actively working on the project. All I expect is minor suggestions or feature suggestions. The point of making this open source, is that there will be inevitably lots of bugs during Alpha phase, so keeping it open source make sense, even if it does carry to risk of being copied. However, once it is ready for release, there is no point keeping it open source, as bugs will be at minimum level.

I've not had the time to look at Masonite in a very long time due to various reasons, but is it finally possible to manually return status codes like 301, 404, 403, etc? I remember raising that question the last time I looked at it.
Yep, I will make a github when I’m back to my pc :)

Yes.

Yes, it's actually quite a convenient way to maintain your own code once you get it figured out. &gt; pip install git+https://github.com/&lt;you&gt;/repo Just remember to put &gt; packages=["&lt;package&gt;", "test"] in setup.py. If you miss this then I think it basically just installs an empty package, which was pretty confusing...

So I assumed right then. Anyway, just have fun adding new stuff :)
Lol, show us the source code looks fun
Nice work. Keep it up.
That’s cool. Speed = frame rate?
Quick question. How do I open one? I am pretty new to uploading to github
Nah it’s how fast the acceleration is. Frame rate stays on 60 in this code
How is this useless?

Arigatou senpai. I have always wanted to make something like this but never had the skill nor the patience. You have helped me level up and I promise to use this for good. P.S: None of the browser extensions or toolbar apps quite worked for me. But I'm sure this will.
Cool, I'll check it out.

I'm on (what should be) the final phase of my python/ SQL project: I created a simple billing database, then filled it with some data. The next step was making a few python scripts in order to automate the information query, invoice creation and deletion, etc. &amp;#x200B; The third part is creating a simple UI so that theoretical non-programmers are able to use the database :D &amp;#x200B; I should probably clarify that this is just for my own learning experience, not for commercial purposes.

pl is the short for programming language. Why recreating the wheel when some Engines do it much more better than what you will ever do. A good to do the things will be to go with the godot Engine as it got a built in pl that got almost the same syntax and is easier to do the game you want to do and not making the logic behind it (working with trigonometry, collision detection and other difficult things out there).
There are a few ways to achieve what you want. For the 2D engine, the most commonly used is PyGame, which is a SDL wrapper. You could serialize the structure of the map into JSON, which is pretty straightforward. If you want something more advanced, you write binary files (this tutorial is pretty complete: [https://www.devdungeon.com/content/working-binary-data-python](https://www.devdungeon.com/content/working-binary-data-python#read-boot-sector)). Hope that helps! Good luck!

Thank you I will do that.

You should have him face the direction he's going, not the direction he's accelerating. Nice, though!
I might actually add that lol Thanks for the idea xD
Ah, gotcha! Could be a good use case for screen refresh checking if it was modified so speed = frame rate.. I know there's a site all ready for that, but it doesn't have Lightning Mcqueen.
👍
Thanks 😁
Haha that would be too hard xD
That’s a good idea Should be that hard to make it, thanks for the idea :D
KACHOW thanks
Thanks :D
Nice, That’s a pretty good monitor :P
In second thought That’s the best thing that I’ve ever done! 😁
Building this was a huge journey of making assumptions about how Netflix's code works, being proven wrong, and working around that. I streamed it all on twitch, link to that is in the gist. I've generated a couple different movies and watched them to make sure they somewhat make sense. Being random, it does go down some weird paths and repeat some choices that a normal viewer definitely wouldn't (... shouldn't) do, and the movie penalises them for it in some cases. But the goal is to generate movies that play through to the credits that you could conceivably play on Netflix.
This is lovely
https://github.com/join Create a repository, and add your code to it
1. /r/learnpython 2. You can open your file in write mode and write all of the lines back.
Yeah that's why I propose that's what you do next :).
Yeah, I think it's mostly that you choose an arbitrary bounds for forward facing, and outside of that, it's left or right. For something like a car, it looks better than doing it based on acceleration. The way you're currently doing it is good for something like a spaceship or submarine though, which can only accelerate in one direction. For a challenge, try implementing little wind effects to show the way he's accelerating. Kind of like when you draw motion as a kid, you typically draw little wind lines. You can even have then move and fade away, for a super challenge. 😊
I approve
SPEED

You have now more done than some games that pop-up on the kickstarter, just do a 15 minutes video explaining same things everyone done to death, pass this post as a gameplay mechanic everyone knows but 'with a twist', do some random backgrounds with postapocalyptic environments, concept art of some tracks with a lot metal, blood and chains, call it a spiritual successor to X (just make sure that licencing won't bite you in the ass) and you're good.
Those functions don't even do the same thing, do they? Also Landau doesn't actually tell you anything about actual time - it's the asymptotic behaviour of your algorithm (correct me if I'm wrong)
if it makes someone smile it's not useless :)

Iterate from the last row. Say you've an m×n matrix, use for i in range(m-1, -1, -1) This'll let you access row from the last one. Similarly do it for the columns. This method should work for matrices stored as both lists and numpy arrays. Any corrections are welcome
It would be cmd+left, to go to the start of line, ctrl+shift+right to select the variable name, ctrl+c copy, quote mark to wrap in quotes, comma, quote mark, paste. Then wrap in parens by doing cmd+left to go to the start of line, cmd+shift+right to select whole line, and parens to wrap it. That's like 8 key presses, but a bit of practice with shortcuts and it's 1-2 seconds. My point is not that this is some complex thing which is just about possible with obscure knowledge, but that text editors are designed to do exactly this, make common operations on code easy. A bit of time spent learning the shortcuts pays dividends over porting around a set of sed scripts, one for each string operation. Text editors are designed to do batch operations on code like this. It's well worth practicing the keyboard shortcuts.

I've seen something like three dozen articles about this - all using one of the training databases and either TensorFlow or Keras. And they're all wrong. Imagine trying to teach someone how to fly an airplane by sitting them down in the cockpit of a 747 and telling them what the gauges do. Do you really expect them to be able to fly? Even if you let them sit in the cockpit as long as they want? Even if you let them toggle the switches? TensorFlow and Keras are both complicated - *really* complicated. If somebody has never built a neural network, a "Hello, World!" example using either platform will not teach them how to build one. All it will teach them is how to run *that particular code* to solve *that particular problem.* The "Hello, World" of neural networks in Python is a super-simple, two-layer, linear- or logistic-regression network. Don't even use NumPy: use Python lists. Make the code as easy to understand as possible. Here's an example of a neural network in, basically, 10 lines of code: import math, random, sys class NeuralNetwork: def __init__(self): self.weights = list(random.random() for _ in range(9)) self.bias = [0, 0, 0]; self.outputs = [0, 0, 0] def forward_propagation(net, inputs): for node in range(3): activation = sum(inputs[j] * net.weights[node * 3 + j] for j in range(3)) + net.bias[node] net.outputs[node] = 1 / (1 + math.exp(-1 * activation)) # sigmoid function def loss(net, targets, node): return -(targets[node] * math.log(net.outputs[node]) + (1 - targets[node]) * math.log(1 - net.outputs[node])) def cost(net, targets): return sum(loss(net, targets, i) for i in range(3)) / 3 def backpropagation(net, inputs, targets, learning_rate = 0.01): for node in range(3): for input in range(3): net.weights[node * 3 + input] -= learning_rate * inputs[input] * (net.outputs[node] - targets[node]) net.bias[node] -= learning_rate * (net.outputs[node] - targets[node]) There you go - complete, three-node, logistic-descent neural network. Want to show how it's used? net = NeuralNetwork() inputs = list(list(random.randrange(1, 9) / 10 for _ in range(3)) for _ in range(3)) targets = list(list(random.randrange(1, 9) / 10 for _ in range(3)) for _ in range(3)) for epoch in range(250001): for i in range(3): if epoch % 10000 == 0: # print results every 1,000 epochs forward_propagation(net, inputs[i]) if i == 0: print('Epoch ' + str(epoch)) print(' Example ' + str(i) + ' Input: ' + str(inputs[i]) + ' Target: ' + str(targets[i]) + ' Output: ' + str(list(round(net.outputs[i], 3) for i in range(3))) + ' Error: ' + str(cost(net, targets[i]))) forward_propagation(net, inputs[i]) backpropagation(net, inputs[i], targets[i])

Those aren't the same algorithm. `fac1(100)` prints the numbers 1 to 99. `fac(4)` prints the numbers 4 to 100 (your indention is borked, could be 4 to 99). That said, if you can write your algorithm sanely as a loop do it. Recursion is a heavy operation that uses more memory and takes more time to execute. There are rare occasions where recursion is useful but try to avoid it at all costs.

Who gives a hoot if people take your code that you've admitted probably won't be great and will not be worth anything? You're doing this to solve a problem you have, do that and hope it can benefit the community. Don't worry about jerks who want to take credit. Do good and don't let the bad stop you.

ive searched a bit, what i looked for was the same exact behaviour but on a pre existing terminal, i didnt found anything and i have no idea how to make a package for atom.
Before I start feeling too good about myself, I also spent an hour debugging a hash error to realise that I had set content type to x-www.. instead of json 🤦🏻‍♂️
Should I write a tutorial or something? I think pushing from GitHub is pretty useful rather than using PythonAnywhere directly and the documentation is definitely lacking.
Maybe [this](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter17/) could help.
Cursed\_windowstaskbar
Why do you need a package for Atom? Just run your code in a terminal... What terminal are you using? It's as easy as typing "python script.py".
I'd say there is a lot of laravel inspiration :)

I think is more powerful with Trees data structure
There are a couple of ways to do it on Android. You can use a Python interpreter such as QPython, or you can use something like Termux where you have access to a sandboxed shell and the terminal. From the implementation pov, one way that I have seen is something called SL4A which lets Python access Android's API, but I'm not exactly sure how it works.
shitz that's genius
sorry in my post doesn't change the parameter but either way recursive is same is double of iterative but I think from two ways the first way is asymptotic and real computational but I think is more powerful in Tree Data structure

 I'd say keep an eye on variable types, those can be a pain in the neck in the beginning. &amp;#x200B; Don't be afraid to try stuff, ask around, etc. &amp;#x200B; Once you get past the 'absolute newbie' point (by which I mean when you start feeling like basic tutorials and such are getting a bit boring), what worked for me was finding something I wanted to do (like a character generator for a tabletop rpg, or a random number generator, etc) and try your hand at it. It doesn't have to be anything fancy, but the fact that you have a personal interest in it can give you an extra motivational boost :) &amp;#x200B; If you find yourself stuck, I'm willing to help, just send me a pm! Though I do warn you that I'm a self-taught amateur python programmer, so my knowledge it's limited :P &amp;#x200B; In any case, best of luck!
Oh, also, I'd recommend making a repository of useful code for your own personal use, once you get a solution for a problem that pops up frequently. &amp;#x200B; And don't worry about copying solutions from other places: from my understanding, the tricky part here isn't inventing new tools, it's taking existing tools and putting them together in such a way that you get the results you need :)

Good work OP
the packages are installed in the correct way, maybe its just me being sily, but all i wanted was a simple script that allowed me to press a key in atom, auto detects which language it is, runs it in a terminal and then closes. thats just me saving myself from having to open up a new terminal, cd into the folder, and then running it. it might be the most pointless improvment, but it is one anyways

TIL about pipx, been using pipsi all this time.
Nice app! A few details could improve UX, moving the menu selection with "left" "right" and quitting with "q". I could make a PR if needed. Also, why not skipping the menu and using shortcuts for all the actions?
Yes please! This would be wonderful.
It would help to have the exact error displayed. First make sure your python version is 3.x. Then in a terminal you can install pip. "Sudo apt-get install python3-pip". FYI Pip is a great piece of software to manage python packages.
old_currencies has only two elements, which have indexes 0 and 1 since Python counts indexes starting with 0. Therefore index 2 is out of bounds as it does not exist in that list, and attempting to assign to an out-of-bounds index raises an exception. If you need to set something at index 2, you must either initialize the list with a third element, or use the .append() method of lists to add the third element later.

I'm not sure exactly what you're trying to do, but from the looks of that code, you may be better off with a dict instead of a list, with keys consisting of a two-item tuple like `("BTC", "USD")`. As the [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) states, flat is better than nested.

Country western Songs? no, too hard to scrape them all, so prject guttenberg and the king james bible it was. Takes 2 seconds for the trainer to run. Then pick a starting word and the number of words to output (rolls random number, follwos that probability link to the next word), and here we have it responding to being asked about God!

A little CLI tool that connected to reddit, allowed you to pick a subreddit, a thread and then pull the comments with some other fairly useless data down into a csv table. That was the first thing I did myself, but of course not the first python code written, before that I was stuck in a loop of getting halfway through courses and using places like codecademy, codingame etc. to try to get some practice. To anyone new, starting your own little idea, thinking it through, going through some trial and error, googling the issues you run into etc. is supercharged learning compared to dry bottom-up learning.
Nice. What did you use to make it? Like just a regular compiler or something with pygame

The whole thing with python OOP and ‘self’ could be confusing but it sounds like you’re past that. One pitfall I’ve experienced with Django when using model serializers and html templates is you end up with views that inefficiently query the database. Just something to keep in mind. The Django ORM is great but it comes at a cost. The Django debug toolbar helps with this.
Very minor detail, but I believe what you have is the x-component of the velocity, not the speed. Speed is the magnitude of velocity, and cannot be negative. In any case, this is great. Take my upkerchoo.

A coworker gave me a quick tutorial on the format and how to interface with it, but I had to figure things out. I had an ex-coworker's code to start from which basically searched for key strings and really scaled poorly. Years later when I redid it, I just chose to do the opposite of what had been done before.

Oh, then the language and ide don't matter. You want academic papers on image processing techniques.

Yes. Python oop was a bit confusing for me initially. It's alright now. I was reading that the orm queries are lazily evaluated. Is that what you were saying?
How much experience do you have? Please share more about the project.
try with histograms. make a histogram for each image and compare them, the difference between hostograms will be visual similarity (of colors)
How would using histograms work, exactly?
count how many red, green and blue values are on the image (maybe plot it) and then find the difference between the histograms by substracting them
Ah, I did not find it when doing my research... Should look harder next time I guess
btw histogram is just an array, where n-th element is how many n-valued-reds(greens/blues) are in the image. usually histograms' length is 255 (if you are using ordinary rgb)

Raytheon was giving out cards at a security conference, full of messages you were to try and decode. On the card was a program in C that would decode/encode a message. I figured out what each line did and then coded it into python. The encryption key was an unsigned char type in C, so that meant range of 0-254, made decoding via brute force (incrementing a for loop by 1) a quick option.
Nobody is going to kill you for the PEP 8 mistake. We just gonna hang you by the balls. ;-p ha ha ha ha LOL. Just kidding ;-) I love what you build. Yes usesless but I did not know you could build this with python.

The source distribution (sdist) will not work because the requirement.txt file is not included in the .tar.gz. When you run "python setup.py install" you will get a FileNotFoundError in setup.py.

Damn....! I personally never used python 2 since, I have only been coding from the past 1.5 2 years.
You want to search for “image hashing”. pHash or perceptual Hash and other hashing algorithms are already built for python. They can give you a pretty good distance hash telling you how similar images are.
I’m probably missing the point here but maybe some kind soul can save me * function doesnt return 1% what the name seems to imply but 5% * kwargs are defined/called with double asteriks, a single one is for args * Why the evil laugh, or is the above the whole point of this post?
Personally have used Dash for several projects. Dash runs on Flask and there's a page directly for integrating with Flask (first in the Google search, on mobile so linking is hard). If you have big data (or even just big spreadsheets :p) you should pre-calculate aggregates instead of making them on the fly. Otherwise, it's very slow and unresponsive and annoying. Obviously, for the prr-calculation, you can just groupby-agg the columns you're interested in, as long as the operations are fast (eg ~100 mb dataframes at most). As for how to figure out what you want to show... Start with Jupyter interactive notebooks (ipywidgets) and play around with different ideas. At some point, you may feel you hit a brick wall of difficulty in specifying what you want to show, and then you can start thinking about Dash, what controls and callbacks you need (probably only one huge callback function tbh, and helper ones that update your controls), etc. Bar charts for grouped data should have the ability to be scaled to 0-1, for comparability (add a checkbox). You should add other little things to make the experience just a bit better. Dash DataTable has filtering and such, but it feels a bit immature for my liking. Oh! Load your data once, and always do transformations with copies rather than original data. Feel free to ask questions, though I'm not sure I'll be able to answer them all. :D

1. /r/learnpython 2. Python lambdas don't capture their environment - the `i` in your definition is the value of `i` at the time you call it, not at the time you define it.
DEJA VU!
There might be better explanations, but a quick Google search turned up the following: https://stackoverflow.com/a/17393879/3912576
Thx for the direction I will post this there. Still, doesn't lambda get called when I run m(1)? And the range(3) still makes its 0\*x, 1\*x, 2\*x, no?
The lambda gets called when you call `m(1)`, and the loop is over at that point, so `i` is equal to `2`.
The input function returns a string, write if foo == "5" and It will work
r/learnpython is that way. &amp;#x200B; 5 is a number "5" is a string. &amp;#x200B; Strings are not equal to numbers, the string "5" is not the same as the integer number 5. input reads strings from stdin.

The expression [lambda x:i*x for i in range(3)] is parsed as [(lambda x:i*x) for i in range(3)] So it generates a list of three anonymous functions. These functions are identical and all refer to the local *variable* `i`, which after the generation is bound to the last number in the range, 2. One to avoid that binding-to-variable-not-value is to use defaulted argument, because the default value is evaluated when the lambda is created: [(lambda x, k=i:k*x) for i in range(3)] Disclaimer: it's been years and years since I last used Python for anything but simple calculations.
PyCharm is your best option if you want a full featured IDE. There's really nothing else on the market that can compete.
I think I am getting the hang of it. So during the loop for `[(lambda x:i*x) for i in range(3)]` expression, the creation of the list goes like: `[i*x] i=0` `[i*x, i*x] i=1` `[i*x, i*x, i*x] i=2` and gets stuck with `i=2` all the time. Also thank you for the workaround to this, it makes more sense now.

Forth
Its use was satisfying your creative urges.
Sorry, they do but not for the paradigm I'm used to. Basically class Agent() def doSomeVeryLongAsyncProcessOnAnotherThreadOrProcess() agents = array of instances what I wish would be possible: somePool.map_async(Agent.doSomethingVery, agents) Essentially, a way to easily map a class function (even if static) to a set of instances and get the instance methods to run in different pools. It would be amazing if it were possible to do this somehow with non-static methods, but that wouldn't be possible for multiproc and I'm pretty sure threading could get messy. I understand why this isn't possible al' vanilla, or at least not without writing a wrapper or some kind of manager as someone else has kindly pointed out, but then eventually you just end up writing a lot of boilerplate to what amounts to stuffing data in and out of processes and carefully handling mutex's for threads. In that case, I'd rather just refactor to a stateless arc, it just feels cleaner and more pythonic. I guess I got the urge to do something like this after working with say NodeJS for so many years, and it makes sense there given how JS internally represents objects/classes, but within Pytnon not so much.
Reminds me of the weird things I made as a kid in Flash way back. I need to go back to that instead of the overly ambitions abandon projects.

I think PyCharm is pretty awesome as a Python IDE. I do use vscode from time to time, mostly out of curiosity. Though not a full IDE like pycharm and so not fully comparable but I found it pretty good.
Vim
Keep dynamic programming to a minimum. It is a very, very, very sharp knife. Wonderful when you need it, dangerous every time.
Spyder, b/c variabele ecplorer and interactive gui
Same here, and to answer to the "why?" part: because that's the IDE I use for all programming languages (and textual stuff too, e-mail, docs, etc.) and because it is configurable enough to get very good support for Python.
Thanks :)
I'd keep the menu but have the shortcuts if possible. Please send a PR if you have some time :)
Never heard of this one. Thank you
That's what I wanted to achieve with threading. I've considered asyncio but I'd wait for a while until I move to a newer prompt-toolkit when they release it. I want to use \`async/await\` keywords but it's only in 3.7+. So It's better to wait in my opinion.
```py if 5 == int(input("Enter a number :")): print("Is number 5") else: print("is not number 5") ```
When you want to pass instances to other threads/processes, you have to implement the [\_\_getstate\_\_ / \_\_setstate\_\_](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#object.__getstate__) methods.

[roboversion](https://pypi.org/project/roboversion/) is a small package written in standard Python that automatically produces project versions by inspecting Git repository state. The idea is to be able to specify your prerelease branches (if you have any) and have the current version produced for you, based on the history of the current Git ref relative to those branches and your tagged releases. Its main use is probably in versioning of development artifacts for continuous integration, but it's also just nice to drop a `get_version` call into [`setup.py`](https://setup.py) and let the repository be the source of truth!
I don't think requirements.txt should be parsed, rather have it for development purposes and specify requirements in the setup.py it self.
PyCharm or vim, depending on what I'm doing. These are the two best ones. Vscode and atom are both... rough around the edges.
Wing IDE has been pretty good for me.
I personally like Vim too, I've used it for about and year (long time ago) to develop my scripts. But I found that it is hard to refactor stuff. On PyCharm you just click and point refactor stuff, extract constant, creating super classes, etc. Last time I had extract function in vim I had to write some vimscript code to implement a naive version of it. Has that situation changed now? Maybe neovim has refactoring plugins?

Yep, no worries, it's great that you made your own library.
I just inherited a Python 2.7 project at work. Thankfully it's being "decommissioned" but until then I'm tasked with maintaining it.
Hey it may be a "useless" program but those little things always mean something! I love seeing fun little projects like that as they are great way to take a break from the real world to have some fun and even learn stuff along the way. &amp;#x200B; Keep up the fun :)

&gt; I just hope I'm not overlooking some glaringly obvious way to do proper multithreaded/multiprocess programming within 3.6. Just… use multiprocessing? Everything you say you want to do can be done just using multiprocessing. Worker pools are the lion's share of the documentation. Also, if you want to pass data between processes and threads, look at queues.
Uhh...they do. Most of my coworkers do, despite the official version finally being 3.7. I could too, but I just decided to stop using Python 2.7 unless I have to. I only support it if I’m forced to.
Changing the timestamp in srt files (subtitle files). Had movies in some FPS but subtitles were for higher so they desynchronized. My script fixed that 👍

This is what my friend told, if it helps. The PDF in the link contains standard resistor values. Those values needs to be extracted from the PDF and store it in a python code. The user has to enter a desired resistance value. What the program has to do is use the standard resistance values taken from the PDf, connect the resistors in series or parallel or both to get the desired resistance value. It has to tell the user how to place the resistors to get the value
I expect you're looking for [futures](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html). But I'm still not completely clear on why the stdlib multiprocessing library isn't meeting your needs. Maybe you could post a code example?
Visual Studio Code Flexible and a ton of features. It gives me a single editor for everything I do from inspection of JSON to Angular and typescript, and Python. There is a ton of community support and it is actively being updated. I have a team that uses Mac, Windows and Linux and it is a common editor we can all use. Git support is good and there are plenty of extensions for other tools or even databases. Someone on our team recently created an extension to easily login to AWS and get temp access key and session key to make developing Boto3 code easier. Most importantly, no subscription required
&gt;i know that SQLite isn't necessarily the most performant database and wondered if I should try and migrate to something else? I'm not really sure how necessary this is. I'm using SQLAlchemy to interrogate the database. If you can avoid using a database at all it might be faster. It doesn't sound like there's much advantage to using a database here unless this is meant to be a persistent process with lots of data coming in that needs to be continually processed. It sounds like you might be able to just store each passage on a single line (or delimit in some other fashion) in a text file on disk and then just read in a line at a time and send it to your (work queue?) multiprocessing architecture to do the work. I haven't benchmarked a DB query vs read operation like this but I'm almost certain that reading will be significantly faster. I am assuming you would do this step in a linear, single process way. And anyways, I guarantee your multiprocess workers won't be able to keep up with a single-process read operation so there's probably no point in spawning multiple processes for this step. &gt;I'm curious about how best to store the results. Can i continue to write to a text file or would it be better to connect to another database and store the results there? I guess it depends on the end use. Do you, or other people, need the results in a database format for lots of read/write operations? If this is a one-off processing task then I would just store it as a text file
Python: I am speed.
On your first day the onboarding starts, they will show you the building, offices, where to get coffee, etc. You will probably get a desk and a machine that you will be able to install/configure to your liking. Then the more experienced devs or a project manager will probably assign tasks to you, perhaps using their ticket system. You should just focus on staying relaxed, they have hopefully been through this process many times, and setting you up so that you can be productive is their job. IMO the most important thing is to ask questions when you don't understand something or when you're not sure how to solve a task. Try to start with a few simple tasks if it's up to you, and complete them properly. Hopefully the code is well maintained and there is decent documentation. Good luck.
Code block is slightly messed up so I can't tell entirely if the code is correct. Can you tell us what errors you're getting?
multiprocessing will fork the parent process. an instance that was created in the parent process should be accessible to child processes, but in general this is bad practice due to race conditions etc. so the more common approach is to use a multiprocess safe queue and mutexes to control interprocess communication. &amp;#x200B; [https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#synchronization-between-processes](https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#synchronization-between-processes) &amp;#x200B; strictly speaking, OOP is a little clumsy for parallel processing workflows, so I recommend using simpler data structures and basic functions (as you've already started to do) to organize your code to whatever degree is practical.
It's understandable to be scared at any new job. The reality in this line of work is that you *will* often feel lost or overwhelmed during the first 2-6 months. However, this is normal - every programmer moving to a new job goes through this, even those of us with years of experience. Managers know this and especially in your case, since this is your first job in the field, they won't expect much from you at the start. For the first month you'll probably just get tutored, read code and docs and work on a couple of small features. Just relax, pay attention and don't be afraid to ask questions and I'm sure you'll do fine. Good luck!

Saw some earlier interesting post about gravity simulators in Python and thought it might as well share mine! I would love to get feedback on the code. **Source:** [https://github.com/albinjal/Gravity\_Simulator](https://github.com/albinjal/Gravity_Simulator) Also, feel free to use it on your own or change it around :)
I've read about it but am clueless as to how it all works. I really need someone to do it for me.
Please do!! I currently code directly into pythonanywhere for one of my projects and it makes me feel horrible.
Tangential question. Is the book any good?
Your first day of job? At a big company? Well, it will probably looks like 😁 1. Go over paperworks 2. More paperworks 3. New hire training 4. Lunch 5. New hire training 6. Get to know your colleagues 7. Go home
1. /r/learnpython 2. You can pass your `win` variable to the function as an argument.
Use `return` statements and function parameters. The module you're writing should not pull or put anything from/into your main file.
Your post should be in r/learnpython But short answer; you pass the variable as a parameter to the function
I’ve got experience with multiprocessing apply_async which allows you to collect results from each worker to a common location asynchronously via a callback function that accepts the return of the applied function. In my case those results were collected and transformed into a data frame which was then written to an h5 file one time after closing and joining the pool. 20,000 records is no problem for that. My case was against a repository of independent files. With SQLite it appears that you need to have independently created database connections per concurrent task for it to work.
Is there a download anywhere?
I don’t have much experience with Pycharm, but if it doesn’t work out definitely check out VSCode. It’s one of the best text editors out there for web dev imo.
Ah, in Python 3 they changed how `print` worked. Anywhere that there's a `print` statement you'll need to add parentheses. So print "hello world" Becomes print("hello world") So just add an opening parenthesis `(` right after the word `print` and a closing parenthesis `)` at the end of that same line.
I tried it however it says that 'win' variable is not pygame.Surface. When I copy-paste exactly the same code to main, it works...
In general, thank you for your help and I am really sorry for wrong sub.
Does this require a sim card, and does the type of phone matter?
You could do that in so many ways. You just don‘t know enough python. If you give a function reference to someone, it contains the owning object. So if you have an object with method foo, you can use a.foo as an argument for a function. When it calls this function, it calls a.foo(), without knowing about the object. You could also use a wrapper function that takes an object and calls foo on it. You could also write a function generator, but that‘s where the magic truly begins...
I'd use a while loop! Excuse the formatting, I'm on mobile, but maybe something like this could work? Print("what's your password?") Input = input() while myPassword != input: Print("try again") Input = Input() Print("access granted!")
Gnome console with vim, with tmux, zsh and oh-my-zsh. 40% because because it looks cool, 60% because everything is only a keystroke away.
I am so terribly sorry, but I have another error. It now says this. line 10 return mid ^ SyntaxError: 'return' outside function This is what my code looks like now. def binary_search(list, item): low = 0 high = len(list)-1 while low &lt;= high: mid = low + (high - low) / 2 guess = list[mid] if guess == item: return mid if guess &gt; item: high = mid - 1 else: low = mid + 1 return none my_list = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] print("binary_search")(my_list, 3) # =&gt; 1 print("binary_search")(my_list, -1) # =&gt; None
I don't think it matters what you use. As long as you have a workflow that is comfortable and can do things efficiently. I recently switched to vscode and it works for me. Used Vim for a long time before that. Try different ones a chance, you will know.
why would you like to 2.x docs?

I would suggest you use a text editor or something with python integration for syntax checking. All these problems you're having can be caught there and fixed.
I am enjoying the book! there is a lot to learn.
I am using PyCharm?
Ok so your entire `while` block needs to be indented 4 spaces. If you're using a decent editor you should be able to highlight it then tap tab to do it. This code needs to be indented. while low &lt;= high: mid = low + (high - low) / 2 guess = list[mid] if guess == item: return mid if guess &gt; item: high = mid - 1 else: low = mid + 1 return none
When you say month long do you mean it took a month to run the simulation or it is simulating the gravity between the moon and earth over the course of a month simulation time?
Thank you! I will work on this now.
Awesome work. Just took a peak at Vusion and it looks really cool. Been meaning to learn some frontend js so this will be a great resource. Keep it up!
Thanks mate!
I have an old HP, running windows vista business. It’s a 32 -bit OS. I’m on python.org/downloads/windows/ and I’ve selected Python version 3.7.3 and when I press download it does to my laptop, but it won’t open or run or allow me to save. It downloads and just stays there?? Any help would be greatly appreciated - sorry for being such a nooooob

Great. Even I am learning flask so that I can integrate keras and flask together.
Newbie here, so not sure it's any help but did you download Anaconda? Jupyter comes with it. At least that's how I've done it.
Sure, but for production, the best way to integrate them together is to use Tensorflow serving :)
Do I need to master tensorflow if I already know keras?
Which specific file did you download?
\&gt; I don't think anyone still uses 2.7 &amp;#x200B; Ugh.
Judging by the millions of seconds on the timer, I bet it is showing a period of one month. Although it could be both, and the gif is then sped up.
Did you try following https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html ?
Absolutely not, Keras uses Tensorflow as a backend which means it's like a layer for easily creating models with Tensorflow. TF Serving is just a containerized service to deploy your models for production and scale easily!
Oh wait I’m an idiot, I think I good so far. Ive downloaded python 3.4.0 Windows x86 MSI installer? Am I doing it right?
How large is a "large" passage of text? Because it sounds like that data should easily fit into memory and not require any database at all.
wow no formatting fuck
Looks great!! Looks great, one recommendation is to put the axes in units of AU (astronautical units) earth should be very very close to 1 au, but due earths to eccentricity it’s not exactly 1.
here's some advice: &amp;#x200B; 1. don't pretend to know something you don't, you'll just sink yourself lower. You should never do this but it's a lot easier when starting because it's more expected :) You're not expected to know everything, so don't worry when you don't. Just do what you need to learn it. 2. Keep a private wiki/journal of some sort. It can be simple. Like, "today I learn that X system is integrated with Y system to accomplish Z function". Or you can start doing more elaborate stuff explaining things in detail. Or, I solved "Error: asdf" by doing XYZ.
It is simulating gravity over a months period, the simulation only took like 10minutes to run. I probably should have phrased it in a clearer way.

just an oversight, thanks for noticing, have now added links to 3.x docs too
good work!
I think animations like this should have normalized axes so 1 unit on X and Y is the same
You should label the axis with the unit of measure, is it meters? Kilometers? Parsecs? It feels like it should be a distanze/length measure but I’m not even sure of that...
Have you looked at SciPy ? It provides lots of useful utilities for scientific applications like this one, like vectors.
Exactly what do you mean by "compiler" here? Python doesn't have a dedicated compiler program like other languages (C, C++, or the "compiler" in Java).
I just happened to notice this while poking around but this is a really weird way to write this: first_result = [x[0] for x in results] second_result = [x[1] for x in results] third_result = [x[2] for x in results] fourth_result = [x[3] for x in results] fifth_result = [x[4] for x in results] analysis_res = { "first_prob" : {str(first_result[0][1]) : str(int(first_result[0][2] * 100))+'%'}, "second_prob" : {str(second_result[0][1]) : str(int(second_result[0][2] * 100))+'%'}, "third_prob" : {str(third_result[0][1]) : str(int(third_result[0][2] * 100))+'%'}, "fourth_prob" : {str(fourth_result[0][1]) : str(int(fourth_result[0][2] * 100))+'%'}, "fifth_prob" : {str(fifth_result[0][1]) : str(int(fifth_result[0][2] * 100))+'%'} } [https://github.com/Merwanedr/Vusion/blob/master/server/server.py#L47](https://github.com/Merwanedr/Vusion/blob/master/server/server.py#L47) I would do this instead (and then re-wire your frontend): def format_result(result): return { "label": str(result[1]), "score": f"{result[2]*100}%", } analysis_res = [format_result(result) for result in results] I think the function improves readability but you could inline it too.
As someone with little knowledge of these things, what would make it take a month to run the simulation. And does that mean literally leaving the computer on for a month as it simulates every second of that time. Thas crzy
You're right but I first wanted to serve it as an API that's why I made it like this haha
If anyone is curious, the program is built around ”Space image” objects which holds all the simulation data a particular moment. I then use a ”next\_image(n)” method to calculate how all the data should change if we move n seconds forward. For example, if velocity for object1 is \[1000, 0\] m/s the position for object1 will become \[a+1000\*n, b\] where a and b are the previous position. In this simulation n = 1 (I will have data for every second). I then jump between these ”Space images” as fast as I can and every 60 \* 60 image (every hour) I save a plot with the data. After 60 \* 60 \* 24 \* 30 the simulation period will be a month and I then convert all the plot-images into a gif. I then cropped it a little and sped it up by 50% Check out the repo for more details: [https://github.com/albinjal/Gravity\_Simulator](https://github.com/albinjal/Gravity_Simulator)
No one is going to help you if you can't help yourself.
Yes, i agree, this is just sloppy by me. The unit on both axes is **meters**!
Hi thanks, i've been working on the multiprocessing part and what you say about callbacks is very helpful!
Hi, on disk the whole thing is about 50MB. It was collected into a database by myself some time ago. What would be the best way to load it into memory?
Good point! I haven't even thought about it being a rectangle!
good bot
They would both count as "serving it as an API" though? You're taking your results, for example `[result1, result2, result3, result4, result5]`, and your code is doing this: first_result = [result1, result1, result1, result1, result1] And then later you use that to grab the first of 5 copies of it (`first_result[0]').
Please for the love of Mike, before asking any more questions read [this](http://www.sscce.org/). Its written for Java programmers but it applies to any programming language, including Python. Don't just dump a shitload of code in our laps and expect us to trawl through it to find out what's wrong.
What’s the error? Way to hard to figure out with formatting. Maybe with the error posted it’ll be easier.
No, I haven't but I will check it out. I figured there should be resources for working with Vectors but I thought it would be quite fun to write on my own this time since I recently graduated Linear Algebra. Thanks!
I know nothing about coding, Python or scripts hence my post.
&gt; What's the newest and best programming language? The newest is the language I just invented thirty seconds ago, it's so new I haven't even decided on a name yet. The best is INTERCAL.
Tens of thousands of people still use 2.7. 1st Jan 2020 is when 2.7 reaches end of life and it will receive no more bug fixes, including security fixes. After that, your choice is to either pay for third-party support, or to continue using it without bug fixes. Both choices are perfectly viable, and I expect that there will still be Python 2 users for at least a decade to come.
I mean just use it within Python. You can read it once from a simple file at startup and then just store it in a list or something.
Python 2 won't disappear on 1st Jan 2020. It just reaches EOL from the core devs. It will still have paid third-party support, or people can use it without bug fixes and security upgrades. For many applications, that's perfectly viable. I know of at least two companies that are still running legacies Python **1**.5 applications, because they work, they get the job done, they don't need security upgrades, and why spend money migrating them when they don't need to be? Its easy enough to just run them in a VM with Python 1.5.

Running the simulation for every second in a month is probably what OP did and it took about 10 minutes. A month might be an extreme experiment but if OP was running something like a Monte Carlo on his simulation it could take quite a long time.
I feel bogged down by full IDEs, and generally use sublime text with a plugin called anaconda (no relation to that python distribution), alongside a terminal/ipython. It's fast and doesn't get in my way, though I'm sure I'm missing out on all the fancy features of IDEs. Visually, spyder appeals to me more than pycharm, which always looks like crap and out of place on my plasma desktop.

Compilation error. Not polite enough.
That's a neat little sim! I once wrote something similar when I was first learning to code, though my version was not as neatly organized. A few suggestions: Use a class for your `Vector` objects, so that you can use operators rather than `vector_add` and `vector_multiply_by_k` functions. Or us a library like `numpy` that provides vectors for you. Consider upgrading your numeric integration. You're currently using Euler's method, which is very easy to understand, but introduces lots of error into gravitational calculations like these. That error is why Earth has some residual downward momentum at the end of your simulated month in your gif. The Runge-Kutta method is one good alternative. Using a better integrator will let you use larger simulation step sizes, and thus be able to simulate more stuff over longer time periods without running forever.
There is nothing wrong with this. Some people will complain about you reinventing the wheel, but you probably learned more implementing your own Vectors than you would by just using someone else's. Now if this was going to be part of a professional product worked on by a large team, the argument might be quite different :)

Have you let it run longer to see how stable it is? Like if you let it run for 1000 years, has the moon flown away? Numerical gravity simulation is always subject to compounding error - it may be small in short time periods, but tends to accumulate.
And while we're at it, you could display the time unit as something more meaningful than seconds - like days and hours. Just a thought
Your solution seems more elegant. I agree.
I'm not really sure but I noticed some things about the simulation time. For me, a big part of the runtime was dedicated to generating the almost 700 images making up the gif. Not sure exactly how much but it was very noticeable. I also think the required simulation time would grow exponentially with the addition of more bodies. The workload for 2-4 bodies is fairly low though.
whoops
Agreed, that would improve things
Big thanks, that's great feedback! Yea I figured vector\_multiplication\_by\_k() must not be the smoothest method :) I will also check out other methods as you suggested!

What is the small blue vector from Earth signifying? Everything else seems to make sense but that....
Units. Everything needs units. Also a legend. Show the meaning of the red and blue.
That's a great question! I will definitely experiment more with this.
scipy provides a class for Runge Kutta integration through scipy.integrate.RK45... but I suppose it's more instructive to write your own :)
We shall watch your career with great interest
This is very nice! Good work.
Code can be found [here](https://github.com/TuttleStripes/fo4Terminal). The heuristic is something that I developed several months ago, and my shoddily worded explanation in the github is as follows: "[The heuristic] works by going through each word in the set and finding how many words would be left in the terminal if the word's likeness to the actual answer was x. x cycles from 0 to the length of the word, and the average of all of the words left with all x is that word's score. The word with the lowest score is the suggested click, and is printed next to the word." The accompanying program allows you to mouse over the Fallout terminal and it adds each word to the set for the heuristic. It is buggy, but after several days of fiddling, I have finally got it to read somewhat accurately. The two known issues are: 1. It sometimes misreads words (here it reads "MORTH" as well as "NORTH") 2. It sometimes takes a while for the program to read the word My theory is that both of these are caused by the `█` character that follows the word in the terminal's input section.
According to the manual, [https://dl.djicdn.com/downloads/robomaster-s1/20190612/RoboMaster\_S1\_User\_Manual\_v1.0\_EN.pdf](https://dl.djicdn.com/downloads/robomaster-s1/20190612/RoboMaster_S1_User_Manual_v1.0_EN.pdf) , 41st page, you can upload the code to the robot and s1 can run your code independently without connecting to any app or remote controller.
You have to use idents for if else clauses
Under your section for reduce the code comment says # function to divide two numbers But the code adds the two numbers. Looks good otherwise and I like the concept. Good for introducing newer Python coders to useful concepts. Even a good refresher for those who are well versed in the language.
I'm away from my computer for now but when I get back I'll write down the pseudo for the heuristic so it will make more sense
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar and wiki
I think a two-body interaction is solvable. You may want to look into using something continuous instead of discrete.
Do you recommend me some standardized, organized way to take these notes? I already do this in a nutshell way, basically I create txt files on some subjects that I know I will forget right after reading the documentation (for example configuring some database or using some Docker).
Blue vectors are normalized velocities ( Earth gains a small velocity from the pull of the moon ). Maybe I should not use normalized vectors since the blue vectors should be different sizes.
Yee, unit meters. Red is for force and blue is for velocity, both normalized.
Yea, thats a good thought! The programs internal counter is in seconds but I could ofc just convert it
for work, i tend to use a personal space on the company's wiki. That way I can easily share it if someone else comes across something I've documented personally.
There appear to be two rather obvious bugs in your first 2 lines of code: defsquare(x): return x**2
How do you make a video out of this?
Well, that one vector I asked about ought to (I think) go back to its origin in the next pass, but it seems odd that it'd have a period of 2 lunar months...
It looks like the Earth traveled halfway around the sun from the blue arrow.
This supposed to be a frame dragging sim?

It's always worth stimulating something you have an analytical solution for to check your model does what you think it does. Hell, just for the experience writing a code that numerically solves a simple analytical problem is fun and worthwhile.
Fact.
I used pyplot to create plot-images and then imageio to convert those images into a gif :) https://github.com/albinjal/Gravity_Simulator/blob/5786ccaddfd99c8235e9ea87663103605e9539a9/Simulation.py#L7

This is amazing! My inputs are google timeline and file access timings through emacs.
Code, extensions, library's?
That's cool! What module did you use to simulate this?
Thanks! File access timings sounds like a great alternative/addition for thyme. I'll have to look into supporting that. It shouldn't be a big hurdle (pull requests welcome as well!). TrackLater used to use Google Timeline as well, but I found it too hard to customize and make reactive.
Code: https://github.com/albinjal/Gravity_Simulator Libraries / Extensions : Matplotlib (for plot) and imageio (create gif)
I now realize that using file access tracking would also require a service, not much unlike thyme. How exactly do you accomplish this, is there relevant functionality in emacs?
I collected images with Matplotlib and then joined them into a gif with imageio :)
That's great, thanks!
Thx!!
Or, y'know, how the moon only makes 1 revolution

[xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org) will very quickly become your best friend. For simplicity, craft everything you need into a Dataset and then just export as a netCDF. If you run into serious performance issues, write to a file directly using the netcdf4 library, accessing the numpy arrays underneath the xarray data structures.
Expect wrapping your head around existing codebase and ruleset. Your first tasks can be about writing test (if applicable), it will somewhat help you to understand the code. Also congratulations.
Hell no. Pick a faster, conpiled language
Filling out forms. Going to lunch with the team. So many online training CBT's.. Pay attention when they describe the network to you. They will throw rapid fire technical names and acronyms at you - write them down. You can't look these up later, they are mostly slang (but you will be expected to know that the BOS is the "back office system" etc. Relax, the interview was the hard part, now you will do easy tasks for a while. Good luck :)
I do not believe I understand your heuristic or I disagree with it. The choice should be the word which will derive the most knowledge about the dataset, regardless of the answer. Every choice should cut the remaining dataset in (nearly) half. Which sometimes means picking words already known to be impossible (conflict in one slot) purely to ascertain possible values of another slot. Is that what you're doing? If so, wouldn't you be picking the _median_ score rather than the _lowest_?

I took a quick look at the projects. Apparently you are running your models in the same python process that runs the web server? It is not a big deal in this case because you are probably not serving concurrent requests, but you should look into transferring those CPU bound functionalities to a task queue such as celery, and running them asynchronously, so your requests don't wait until the processing is done.
I got many leads from toptal and was able to maintain myself for a year easily. Now I am back at working full time for a company. I'd recommend going with them if you don't want to manage searching and dealing with negotiation with clients. Anyway, I can give you a referral link to toptal, then we both get $500 bucks, or more depending on your skills. I don't know if that is against the rules, so PM me if you want that. I can also help with a couple tips to help pass the process.
Depends what you are aiming to emulate. If it's for educational purposes, and you are trying to emulate some old processor for example (maybe some MIPS or something) then you are probably fine. You can probably get massive performance improvements by using Pypy. You can also use Cython to help Wil low level stuff or performance hotspots.
You might want to get in the habit of using f strings instead of %, or .format if you're before python 3.6 (I think 3.6 got f strings?). Like you can do `f'completed {frame/frames:.2%}'`, and even `.format(...)` allows something like `{x:.2%}`. Any reason you decided to use sys.stdout and not print? Instead of the pattern of `f = open(...); f.write(...) ; f.close()`, try this: with open(...) as f: f.write(...) To create that path like 'gifs/%s.gif', better to maybe do a format string or `os.path.join('gifs', f'{name}.gif')`. In the main block, maybe better to use argparse rather than take interactive input as the simulation name. You could just run `python simulation.py mysim`, or have a default like `parser.add_argument('--name', '-n', default='gravity_sim')` and then get a default gravity_sim.gif, or just don't take a "name" as much as an output path like `parser.add_argument('--out', '-o', default='gravity.gif', help='output file, default: %(default)s')` Instead of writing a fucking `disp(self)` for Body, maybe define a `__str__` and/or `__repr__`. repr will show the string in the repl if you just type `&gt;&gt; body` and try to see what it outputs, and it'll also output that string if you wrap body in repr like `repr(body)` or format with `{body!r}`. If you overload `__str__`, you'd see it with `{body}` or `print(body)`. You could have repr return like `return str(self)` to use it for both. You could use SciPy for a lot of the math stuff as people mentioned. Otherwise, code looks pretty good
Thank you buddy!
&gt;Relax, the interview was the hard part, now you will do easy tasks for a while. Very comforting to hear this, thanks for the words!
Ok, I'm back. I'll try to explain better. Here is the steps taken for an example word "TEST" from the set `{'TEST', 'BEST', 'BORT', ',MOOD'}`: 1. "TEST" is assigned a likeness `x` of 0. 2. Every word in the set is tested for its likeness to TEST. For example "BEST" has a likeness of 3 because it matches "EST", "BORT" has a likeness of 1 because it matches "T" at the end, and "MOOD" has a likeness of 0 because none of the letters align with each other. 3. Because in the above example only one word has the same likeness as `x`, TEST(0) has a score of 1. 4. Repeating the above with `x = 1`, `x = 2`, and `x = 3` (`x = 4` is not tested because that would mean that TEST is the correct answer), TEST has scores of `{similarity: score}`: `{0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 1}` 5. The average of the scores is taken and assigned to the word. So, TEST has a score of 0.75, because on average, there is 0.75 words remaining after you guess TEST Repeating this process, you realize that this is a crappy example because all of the words have a score of 0.75. Usually you would click on the word with the lowest score, or average words remaining. In this example, however, you could click on any of the words and it would be the most optimal choice.
Haha I will do a lot of that kind of stuff aswell. Just thought it was kinda cool that inserting real world data resulted in data close to the real world observations. For example the circular orbit and the ~30 day orbit time
What's a high level language that's good for emulation?
Very interesting. Would maybe benefit from a crosshair (or a dot) at (0,0) so you can see Earth moving as well.
How much does the gravitational force change, if any, when the Moon is above the Himalayas versus the Marinas Trench? I'm wondering if the point-mass approxmation for Earth is reasonable for Moon trajectory simulation, or if the Moon is accelerating/decelerating based on distances to major geological structures. Maybe a question for r/estimation.

While I personally love Xarray, OP should also check out the Meteorology-specific Iris package. https://scitools.org.uk/iris/docs/latest/
You're right, this is just the dev version, for production I use Tensorflow serving on a Docker container + Kubernetes, but this is another story haha
Anything having to do with Fallout is a check from me &lt;3

I use VSCode for everything but data science (RStudio for R and Spyder for Python)
While not a time saver, but definitely kept HR off my back. We use ADP to punch in. I would forget to punch in, out/in for lunch of out at the end of shift. Resulting in HR calling or emailing. Created a small script to punch me in when I get in, wait at least 4 hours (random) to punch for lunch and random between 27 and 37 minutes to punch back from lunch. Then random time approximately around quitting time to punch out. HR never bothered me again.
 Wow, thank you so much for the feedback! I'm quite new to Python (and programming in general) so input like this helps a lot. I'm gonna try to answer paragraph by paragraph, hope you can locate what I’m responding to. &amp;#x200B; I didn’t even know something like f strings existed but it seems really great, I will definitely use it in the future. &amp;#x200B; I didn’t think much about sys.stdout other than stripping the newline might be good. (not sure it matters doe) &amp;#x200B; I have a bad record of using the: with a() as f: f.b() functionality but I will try to start using it more when applicable. &amp;#x200B; Yea the 'gifs/%s.gif' way seemed a little clunky, is there any other reason to switch to the other method? &amp;#x200B; Using argparse seems like a much better way of doing it now that I think about it (like you said) and I think I will add it in the future. I have never even used command line arguments in Python so think its time to learn it. &amp;#x200B; Ooh, the \_\_str\_\_ and \_\_repr\_\_ seems super neat! This is exactly the type of things I’m trying to learn with this project! I think I will look some more into the documentation for similar things I might have missed. &amp;#x200B; The dataclass functionality seems really cool. I will also look up more about \_\_slots\_\_. &amp;#x200B; Yea, calculate force should probably be a method instead as you’re saying. Writing and changing operators in Python is something I have never worked with but it seems really cool and I will try to practice it in my next project. &amp;#x200B; Yea I know, I had some other thoughts for the project at first (like adding bodies in the middle of a simulation) and some things like add\_body are still in there. I'm also a bit confused about whether it's better to pass the data into the constructor or add it afterward. I'm also not sure why I would not just use SpaceImage.bodies.append(obj) instead of the SpaceImage.add\_body(obj) . I'm kinda confused about these things. &amp;#x200B; I will check out SciPy (and numpy) for future projects. &amp;#x200B; The file name thing is good to know and I will look into PEP8. &amp;#x200B; Again, huge thanks for the response!
Damn, thats a good idea!
But can OP fix falliut 76 with python??
Reminds me of mari/o. Great job.
I meant games.
Hmm, interesting question. I think that the point-mass approximation shouldn't provide a huge error since the scale (both mass and distance) of geological structures is quite tiny compared to some of the other data. Example: Earth radii &gt; 6000km, Earth-Moon distance &gt; 350000km, Mariana trench \~11km, Everest &lt; 9km
Man it would suck if the program ran when you called out sick
We are a medium sized company - not so small that you know everyone, but not so large that it’s no big deal when someone leaves. People kept quitting and my team would sometimes find out weeks or months later when we needed to track something down, so we use Python to query Active Directory once a week and store the stuff list, and email us who was on it last time but not this time.

Not *exactly* the same, but there are several tools that will automatically fix or format your code, and using them covers a wide range of lint errors. My usual script goes: # Removed unused variables, (stdlib) imports, etc. autoflake --recursive --in-place --remove-duplicate-keys --remove-unused-variables . # Use modern syntax, remove double-parens, etc. # Has useful options for minimum version and string formatting. pyupgrade --py36-plus $(find . -name '*.py') # Sorts your imports. Sounds minor, but actually super useful. # See Black docs for config file. isort --recursive --apply . # Format all your code the same way. Not configurable, which is GREAT. # Quite widely used, by e.g. Pytest and Hypothesis black . # Then run the usual tools, ignoring Black incompatibilities flake8 --ignore=E501,W503 mypy . pytest

So I work at a medium sized company and they've been acquiring smaller companies left and right. We have four companies now. The newest one has their entire inventory in like 8 Excel sheets, some of them from different sites in different states. My task was to combine them into one, sour and organized the data, and make new part numbers based on a set template. Luckily I had "Automate the boring stuff" sitting next to me or I'd still be working on this project. My next task is to convince the executives to use databases now instead of 50 page Excel files. They already have MS Access installed so...
Thanks!
Tried to add a direntry handler to [AREPL](https://github.com/Almenon/AREPL-vscode), but apparently you can't import direntry in python 3.5, which is weird because it does exist in the docs. Anyone know how to import it? https://github.com/Almenon/AREPL-backend/commit/5e7c1176b646882d3479ddaf8727a2fe44771f99 https://travis-ci.org/Almenon/AREPL-backend/jobs/546523784
Lovely
I'm currently using Django rest framework with Django rest auth and the built in auth routing as well as the viewsets in the newer versions of DRF are very easy out of the box. For example, if I need standard get/post/put/patch/etc functionality all I need to do is create a viewset, point the router to said viewset, and define access and the queryset and I immediately get all of that functionality out of the box. Does your framework have similar ease of use or would I need to manually create each method within a given controller for each route/type I want?

What OS? If you are using Windows, you would be better off setting up a Service to run at 4:30am. If you are using Linux or Mac, you would set up a cron job. Either way, you would need a script that uses a module like [PyAutoGUI](https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/) to control the mouse.

So Masonite has something called Masonite API https://docs.masoniteproject.com/official-packages/masonite-api I'll admit that it still needs work. I like creating packages for things I am currently using. Like needing validation and building a validation package for example. I haven't created any applications that require heavy API endpoints but some people are using that package and really like it. It does what it needs to do really well. As for the ease of use, yes its pretty similiar to those steps you posts. This would be to create a Resource, attach a model to the resource and add the resource to the route list and you have full CRUD for that model. Adding JWT authentication is adding a class, rate limiting is adding a class etc. Its pretty cool actually.

Great job! You might want to check out vpython if you're interested in simulating physics stuff. We used this when I was doing my undergrad degree in physics a little over a decade ago. At the time I only had experience programming in basic on my commodore 64, but I was able to model electric fields of various charge configurations as well as an N-body. I haven't taken a look at it in a long time, but I'm moderately interested in seeing what I can do now that I have some experience with numpy/scipy.
IntelliJ (or pycharm). For reading/writing markdown, yaml, typescript, python and a bit of shell script &amp; groovy. And then test/run. I don't think the field matters.

At my last job, we were trying to test Bluetooth devices with various cars. We could only test so mang cars from employees, so we needed to check out dealers and pay them to do testing on cars in their inventory. I wrote a program that scraped the data from cars.com and sorted it by make, model, year, and dealership and compare it with the cars the company wanted their products tested with. We also did a lot of testing on IOT products which ran Linux/Android. I wrote programs to automate various tests over UART/adb. We'd rest remotes using a raspberry pi to control pneumatic actuators to press the buttons for various tests. Unfortunately, I told my boss about all of it trying to advance in the company, or at least to move into the engineering department. I essentially made myself invaluable to his team, which didn't work out so well for me. He was a super cool guy, but whenever I'd talk to the guy in engineering he'd tell me that my boss said I was too busy to move over and do stuff for them.

Thanks. I'll definitely look into it. Who knows, if I have something I can contribute I'll play around and submit a PR
Oh my god. You gotta be kidding me... "import antigravity"? But the mini-map does kinda look like the python logo....
Wait... Are you using OCR to read the text??? I'd maybe open cheatengine and see if there's a repeatable way to get the memory address for the words being checked against so it can just read the fallout process memory directly. Of course going down that route you could probably just get the answer too, but maybe more fun to see if you can do it without that
I don't think many people on this subreddit want this kind of content since it's not particularly relevant to python. Perhaps /r/ProgrammerHumor ?
I haven’t done the course but something that’s high quality usually doesn’t become discounted by 98%
You going to fix it?
Lol yes I am using OCR. It took me like a whole damn week of on-and-off fiddling to get it to work properly, and even now it messes up. But at least it isn't reading "JOBS" as "ae oo || th iuoo", or my favorite: "HIGHSCHOOL" as "ee". I'm trying to avoid using things like Cheatengine. I don't know what the boundary of "things like Cheatengine" is, but it's there somewhere.
lol, yeah, it's a much different problem that way but very cool that it works!
That’s awesome! Could you link the code? I’m trying to do some projects like this myself. I ha e automate the boring stuff but do you have any other sources that you used to learn?

Lots of programming g languages use the “import” statement. This isn’t a python thing. 🐥
We had some managers that monitored some queue of work items and emailed people along the lines of "Hey dude, you have thing here that need some eyeballs, you going to get to it?" when stuff had been sitting idle for "too long". One week _all_ those managers were out; a combination of sick, vacation, offsite meetings, etc accounting for the entire week. My team was asked to step in and do this work in addition to our regular stuff. I wrote a script to poll the work queue and send such emails, with random 1-character spelling mistakes inserted into the canned sentences to amuse myself. Launched it, did my normal job, forgot. A few days later I had someone say in the hallway "Hey I got your email, I'm taking care of it" and I blankly asked "What email?". Their phone chimed with another similar email from "me". "You.. you automated this didn't you?"
I switch between vscode and jupyter notebook for data science
How do you want me to post formatted code
I build almost all of my data pipelines in python 3.latest, then migrate them to Go down the line when they prove value and stability. Python has proven to be fast (enough), flexible (plenty) and safe (enough) for this kind of work. I then migrate things to Go when I want to add concurrency and vend single executables with builtin runtimes - makes for a small footprint, saving on deployment times, setup, and disk space. Usually my python projects live for about 3-9 months before they either get squashed or migrated, but it’s always worth it to get things up and running fast.
100%!! I am a graduate researcher in astrodynamics and one of the reasons I dont use matplotlib for trajectory visualizations is the fact that there is no 3D "axis equal" built in. A source of never ending frustration. Venting over, very cool visualization!

Really well done mate, I'm going to have a dig into it later to see how I can reuse for Fo76.
Nicely done OP! I'm a computational astrophysicist and I use gravity simulations much like this one in my research. Some suggestions/homework on the simulation side :) 1. What happens if you let the simulation run too long? How many orbits can you complete before numerical errors add up and the orbits no longer close? What's happening here? 2. How can this problem be prevented? (Hint: it has to do with energy conservation. Look up symplectic integrators.) 3. What's your time step? How did your choose it and why? What happens if you make your time step too big? And why? 4. If you add more bodies, how does the cost of your gravity simulator scale? Why? Is there any way to improve this scaling? (Hint: look up fast multiple moments and the Barnes-Hutt algorithm.)
type annotations are entirely optional in python and, minus a few libraries that pull dirty tricks to inspect them at runtime, are mostly useful in the context of static type checkers like mypy. in light of that, you usually see them either nowhere in a project, or everywhere in a project. does that make sense?
Depends on where you live. Adding python means learning to program. If you really want to do that then go to a bootcamp and double your salary.
What does this have to do with python? I dont see a single line of code

Python in tandem with Excel and SQL are the beginnings of a data analyst’s skillset. If you throw R (and perhaps SSAS) in there as well, you would probably gain the attention of some recruiters for data analyst positions. The beauty of Python is that it’s a great general, all-purpose language. It doesn’t necessarily have to be the focal point of your résumé, as it can also serve as a backup skill in terms of a scripting language. There are plenty of Python developer jobs out there if you would mainly like to work with Python, but there are also plenty of other jobs where it would prove useful as a skill while not solely being a qualification for getting hired. The two fields which will likely place the most emphasis on Python are probably software development and data analytics (and data science, but this is a highly quantitative field which generally requires a graduate degree in math, statistics, computer science, or something similar). Some titles you may want to search for are **Python developer**, **Django developer**, **data analyst**, and **business analyst** for more Python-intensive roles. If you’re more interested in Python as a secondary skill, you may want to search for titles such as **database administrator**, **Linux system administrator**, and **network administrator**, each of which also come with other requirements.
You have no idea how much this comment helps. You just answered a lot of the questions I’ve been trying to find the answer to. I appreciate it! I’m going to keep all of this is mind.
https://www.xkcd.com/353/
It's super hard then.
Take a look into pachyderm. It's probably overkill because you only have one pipeline step, but still.
Not sure how interested in the simulation aspect of this project but... If I'm not mistaken, you are describing Euler's method which tends to leak energy pretty rapidly. If you are interested, you can try algorithms that tend to have better stability. [Verlet methods](http://www.physics.udel.edu/~bnikolic/teaching/phys660/numerical_ode/node5.html) are almost as simple as Eueler methods and they preserve energy and angular momentum quite well. Velocity Verlet is self-starting and should be stable for thousands of years, even with very large delta t between steps. Higher order [Runge-Kutta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods) methods are also very stable (Euler method is RK1, according to this Wikipedia entry). We did RK4 in one of my computational physics classes in college. It's a bit of a bear, but you just about can't beat it for doing long term gravity simulations.
Glad to help! Also keep modules in mind. If you are going to data analyst route, for example, pandas, numpy, and openpyxl are all good modules to know. A lot of employers will be more interested in the specifics rather than the fact that you just know Python. A portfolio is also not a bad idea. If you do not have a Github account, I strongly advise creating one and taking up some personal projects. For instance, keeping up with the data analyst example, you may want to download some datasets from Kaggle and play around with them or demonstrate how you’ve written some scripts to parse Excel files or automate data procedures. The more applicable the examples, the better they are to show off. As an example, I once wrote a Python script to scrape apartment websites and store the apartment information and the URL in an Excel sheet and sort it by price so I could go up the list and search for apartments like that instead of jumping from site to site. Things like this get you attention in interviews because it shows you can not only think about problems programmatically, but you’ve also taken the time to think about a “real world” issue instead of just doing frivolous whiteboard problems (you’ll never have to generate Pascal’s Triangle in the real world).
This is all great info, i have written all of this down! I really appreciate the long and detailed responses. I edited my last comment and added that I have no degree, do you think it’s still possible to get a job in that field without a degree?
I doubt he calculated it for every second in a month, at least that wouldn't make sense since that would be way overboard for accuracy for two body system, especially if he only wants to produce this animation. Every hour in a month would likely be enough, then again, it wouldn't take 10 minutes if he only did every hour.
Couldn't you show momentum vectors instead (mass * velocity)? The large mass of the earth and the small velocity should be similar to the small mass of the moon times it's large velocity (in fact, shouldn't they should balance out to zero, or is my physics too rusty?).
Just created a dialogue reader that can read dialogues on displayed on the screen in my GBA games https://youtu.be/PBHOw7qtHb8
I created a script that would scrub through a folder and find data files. Then clean the signal in the data files and filter them using python, and finally create figures of the new signal and save them! Saved me over 16 hours of work per week, as the program only needs to run for 40 minutes to do what I used to do! I'm a undergraduate researcher so there is always a lot of mundane data stuff that can be automated, I can't wait to create more scripts to do these things for me!

Yes most of the Django and further Programming language Upgraded by python Maybe COBOL play by the futhure. But know the king of the programming language Python.
I don't understand the difference between this and using something akin to bitly. What does "direct" mean in this context?
Here is the code: [https://github.com/albinjal/Gravity\_Simulator](https://github.com/albinjal/Gravity_Simulator) I got started via a Codecademy course a couple of years back. After I got some initial experience I have mostly made a bunch of smaller projects and learned a lot by trial and error (and StackOverflow lol). I have also gained a lot by learning other languages that I can apply when I come back to Python now and then.
Yea I could, I think your right about them balancing out though which means that It would not be a big difference in appearance from the original simulation where the vectors are normalized (same length).
This should make more sense: [https://imgur.com/a/kLZrqIf](https://imgur.com/a/kLZrqIf)
^(Hi, I'm a bot for linking direct images of albums with only 1 image) **https://i.imgur.com/R9eNOZp.gifv** ^^[Source](https://github.com/AUTplayed/imguralbumbot) ^^| ^^[Why?](https://github.com/AUTplayed/imguralbumbot/blob/master/README.md) ^^| ^^[Creator](https://np.reddit.com/user/AUTplayed/) ^^| ^^[ignoreme](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=imguralbumbot&amp;subject=ignoreme&amp;message=ignoreme)
Except that strings (at least in Python 3) aren't ASCII strings, they're unicode - and comparisons on unucode strings are a bit more complicated than that...
But they don't seem to balance in the original simulation. Which is why I am wondering if my physics is rusty. Is there a net linear momentum in the simulation? That would explain it (but also cause it to drift away in a longer simulation).
as i understand from code - it's an application (one window) on desktop where you type in url to shorten, select radiobutton with desired shortening website (hardcoded [hideurl.com](https://hideurl.com), tinyurl.com , localhost and author's app on heroku) and then you get shorten url from selected website.
Hmm. Sounds intriguing. I know that text is represented as Unicode in Python 3. But when commission happens, it happens based on ASCII value. Could you give an instance of what you mean exactly?
Exactly, that's the point of using an application like Shorty, you don't have to visit the actual website to shorten your urls.
Excellent point!
Also, do you have any ideas of doing such stuff without hardcoding services' URLs?
I'm sorry, are you just coming here to preach? You come to the python subreddit and say, "Javascript is *so* much faster, you guys." What are you hoping to gain?
I bet that's not true if you use PyPy, numba or something along those lines
No it doesn't, because it can't possibly be this way because Unicode is a superset of ASCII. Your explanation works because Unicode is backwards compatible to ascii
Nice work!
Do you still have some Google Timeline code? Since I believe there is no official API. As for the file access... in Emacs it is this: ``` (defun log-file-visits () (when (and buffer-file-name (not (eq last-command "xah-close-current-buffer"))) (f-append-text (concat (int-to-string (float-time)) "," buffer-file-name "\n") 'utf-8 "/home/pascal/log-file-visits.txt"))) (add-hook 'find-file-hook 'log-find-visits) ``` I then wrote an aggregator function in Python that takes the log and aggregates it to project level (per folder in my projects, or based on having a .git folder)
Config file? If they need different code: modules? Though dealing with dynamic imports would be kinda wonky I'd imagine
They are as different modules already, you can check it out in the urlCreators section on Github link
It does! Thank you for the clarified output.
I tried it recently, in VSCode, after learning that it does the processing locally now, and you don't need to sign up for an account. I had absolutely no interest in trying it before both of those things, and was still dubious, given the company's reputation! I found it pretty useless unless you're using just standard library modules. If you've written any code yourself, it barely manages to do completions on it, let alone parameter hints or docstrings. I also found the full on auto typing stuff in the vim plugin made it _literally_ impossible to type the text I wanted
How do you capture the screen for the OCR?
Thanks, hoping to also do similar research one day :) 1. I haven't tried running it very long but even in this relatively short simulation, I can observe the orbit changing (Earth has moved). Edit: I tried running it for a year and this is the **result:** [**https://imgur.com/gallery/QiJDfCB**](https://imgur.com/gallery/QiJDfCB) (I kept the same timestep) &amp;#x200B; 2. Hmm, I looked at the hints and here are my initial thoughts: Since it is impossible to do a perfect simulation of reality the key must be to make the errors cancel out? 3. My time step for this simulation is 1 second (total steps = seconds in a month). I initially chose it mostly because I liked the thought of moving an object with vel 1m/s 1m every step. I also thought it should not be too small (millions of steps/orbit) from my beginner perspective and the simulation workload was not too high (the simulation took less than 10 min to run including all the image processing). I like to think about this approximation about millions of velocity vectors trying to approximate a circle (the actual orbit). If I would decrease the number of vectors (by increasing the step size) the approximation would get further away from reality (the perfect circle/ellipse). 4. If I add more bodies the cost of the simulation should scale exponentially which is not preferred. I think the main way to improve this would be (like you suggested) to switch the algorithm. Random thought: This might be really obvious but shouldn't there be a way to instead of taking steps along the linear approximation of the object's movement (velocity) you could also account for the derivative of the velocity and therefore take better steps? (Increase the grade of the polynomial that approximates reality)
Ok perfect I will test it and let you my impression. Actually We are looking for a complete data pipeline manager. We are testing kedro right now (https://pypi.org/project/kedro/). But we are still benchmarking other solution. I will send you an email in the week with what exactly we are looking for. Maybe it can give you some idea of new features to develop. Are you looking for other contributors ?
I'm guessing this is implemented as N-body problem? Which solver did you go with? A body of mine implemented it recently but every solver apart from verlet gave outputs that didn't seem right (Implemented euler first, then euler cormer, then verlet then 4th order runge kutta - though my buddy implemented this on his own so I have no idea on how it performed
This is because I did not save a plot (image) as often as I could. I actually took 1-second steps but only rendered a plot every hour. Taking millions of steps was not too heavy since the force every second is really fast to calculate in this system
Ah sorry, should've made it clearer: I was thinking about having one module per "provider" so that users could dynamically add them or remove them as they like (maybe with some kind of signature to verify they're not malicious) by just copying files to a folder. You then scan that folder in your main code - import the modules via their name and I think there's a module level `getattr` or something like that you can use to execute whatever method from the modules you want (maybe have one `shorten_url` or something like that method per module). So basically a highly dynamic system that users can extend at will or cut providers out of if they don't like them
I let the simulation run for a year instead and here are the results: [https://imgur.com/gallery/QiJDfCB](https://imgur.com/gallery/QiJDfCB) I could let it run for even longer (like 1000 years) but I think I would have to turn down the accuracy for speed's sake then which might not make the results fair.
I agree... I just got rid of it.
Cool. Thanks for the info. Would you be interested to update the blog? Your update would be highly appreciated. Check out [https://github.com/pylenin/pylenin-blogs/tree/master/savan-disawal](https://github.com/pylenin/pylenin-blogs/tree/master/savan-disawal)
Thanks! I might try some of these methods. Computation physics seems really interesting!
Oh man, this is so cool to setup for kids to play with! &amp;#x200B; Draw your maze and hold it up to the webcam to see it solved...
Yea this is an N-body problem but it was more for the sake of practicing programming. I, therefore, went with Eulers method for the simplicity. I might try out some of the others in the future though.

The moon has an initial velocity of 1082m/s but I'm not sure how well the linear momentum is preserved in this simulation. I think the fact that the energy in the system changing is an indicator of the simulation not being perfect
Fork the repo, create a new branch, make the updates and push your changes. The website is still old school. We are using Markdown 😄. But shouldn't be a problem. Also don't forget to add your info to co_author.json and put your image in the images folder. This is our authors page https://www.pylenin.com/authors/
Alrighty 👍 I'm still writing my own blog using HTML so yeah... I don't think it doesn't get much more oldschool :D
Debian + zsh + vim, for everything basically.
At least three points to reconsider: 1. This is a comparison between a framework (node.js) and a language (Python). 2. The result depends on the implementation of the language 3. The result also depends on the implementation of the algorithm &amp;#x200B; So, if you cared for speed for the n-body problem you might not want to use the reference implementation CPython. You might not even want to use python in which case you of course would not choose node.js or javascript either. You might, however, still use python to interface with some specialized library which does the actual calculations, like tensorflow for ML/DL, for example. &amp;#x200B; To sum it up, I don't think this type of comparison has that much practical relevance.

&gt; I am not doing anything nefarious I swear [...] making automated twitter accounts, instagram accounts, linkedin, etc Short answer: Just don't. Long answer: Use their API with a legally obtained API key. I what you want to do is not possible with their API, and you need selenium to work your way around their restrictions, then you are most likely breaching their ToS and may be banned for it.

Sweet! I see you even have "charts" - do you perhaps still have a screenshot of that or something :O? I am not sure if you have the "Google Timeline Entries" or the actual "Google Enhanced Timeline Output" (don't know how to better describe it)? Like, did you expect the data to be from the data takeout?
&gt;Intuition is telling me that creating a simple Flask API to start/stop/update this process is a poor design. Why do you think this? You could do all of this using a REST interface. &gt;Is this something that could be accomplished with an asynchronous message queues feeding updated run-time parameters while the running process publishes results over some sort of message broker (with another service responsible for updating a database)? The only problem with this is that I need the API request to serve a response (not just consume the message from a queue). Yes, you could use something like that. I usually try to [hold off on using a message broker](https://techblog.bozho.net/you-probably-dont-need-a-message-queue/) for as long as possible, because it introduces yet another dependency that you have to keep track of and that is outside of Python.
You're exactly right, could be accomplished with a REST API. My concern is that too closely coupling my REST API to my algorithm is LESS preferable than coupling a pub/sub interface than listens for parameter updates and publishes responses. What do you think? At the moment I am curious if my Docker architecture can resolve this issue or if I need to introduce a task queue as well (not likely as I am only ever running one task). 1. Flask REST API 2. MySQL server 3. RabbitMQ broker It may be helpful to note this is all running on a tightly resource constrained Linux system (if that makes a large difference - 2GB RAM, i3 Celeron).
I'm pretty sure I just used the first guide I found on google. The "chart" variable is just a google timeline instance. The app looked pretty much the same as it did now apart from separate controls (the timeline itself was not interactive)
Even with the use of the API I have occasionally had my accounts shut down. And I mean at the end of the day, I can tell you're a stickler for ToS kind of guy so there's no point in me asking you about this. When I say I'm not doing anything nefarious I mean I'm not doing anything illegal or immoral or harassing of anyone or anything of the sort but I mean I guess I am violating ToS by doing bulk automated tasks if they are banning my accounts so, I'm just trying to figure out how to not get caught.

So, just to preface I'm not trying to be rude or snide, but now that I'm clear about what Shorty is, I realize I don't know how often URL shortening services/sites are actually used today. In addition, are variations of these services typically used simultaneously? I don't know anything about the technology or benefits brought by using these services in the first place, though, so just in case I didn't make that obvious already I figured I'd be blunt.

Well, to be honest, I picked this project just to practice with PyQT and QT library as well, but also, it may be useful for someone, I know people who are really using shortening services a lot, for example, some blog writers who don't want to mess up their writing with huge URLs. About using simultaneously - They are not used simultaneously in Shorty, that's just your choice which do you prefer to use and that's it. I mean, I've just added two of them so user could have a choice which is more comfortable for him. Especially "localhost" choice was added for nerds who may build their own shortener service on localhost :D
&gt;My concern is that too closely coupling my REST API to my algorithm is LESS preferable than coupling a pub/sub interface that listens for parameter updates and publishes responses. What do you think? I think it depends on what you're more comfortable doing. It sounds like you're pretty limited resource-wise, so introducing a message broker (event RabbitMQ) could be a fairly significant hit. I don't have much experience with Redis, but that's [another option](https://redis.io/topics/pubsub). Your "ideal case" is controlled through a web interface, so I guess I'm still missing your reasoning for making it less preferable.
Slightly different. So when Django releases a version (like 2.1) they really only release bug and security fixes for it. So 2.1.2, 2.1.3 etc etc will all be big or security releases. They also do 8 month major release cycles. Masonite does 6 months. With Masonite, minor versions are the same but can also release fully backwards compatible features as well. So for example 2.2.1 can have a bug fix and 2.2.2 can have 4 new methods you can use for testing. This keeps the framework light and unit tests make sure everything will work. New features don’t have wait 6 or 8 months to release. They can release next week if it is backwards compatible. Does that answer your question?
I remade the cowsay package from Linux. You can find it [here](https://github.com/michaelstrefeler/cowsay-python-translation)
My thought was that - even if I use a REST API to interface with the BG process - I still am forced to queue the requests (the parameter updates need to occur in between algorithm ticks). So my thinking was - if I have to implement a queue anyway, why bother wrapping it again in Flask? I can just decouple my HTTP API whose sole responsibility will be HTML serving. 100% agree with you that the overhead is not insignificant and can be accomplished as you've described. Just concerned about some potential major refactoring as the REST approach doesn't seem as expandable.
I decided against using python-Levenshtein because working with integers instead of ratios is easier to my brain
http://charlesleifer.com/blog/redis-streams-with-python/ I'm wondering if Redis fits your use case pretty well. It's not very resource-heavy from what I know, and it provides 1. Key-Value Database 2. Pub/Sub 3. Streams Sounds like everything you'd be looking at setting up?
Sounds like the harder part was the OCR anyway, well done!
I only used `locateAll` for the `&gt;` next to the input area because I don't trust OCR to locate it correctly. For the rest of it, I used PIL's `ImageGrab.grab(region next to '&gt;')` to grab words, then made them fit for reading with OCR with the `fixScreen` function.

Have you ever tried running "import antigravity" in your python REPL?
This is amazing!
Once you start using serious 3D, you really need to switch to something like vtk, be it mayavi, paraview, or your own vtk based GUI.
We make extensive use of a number of APIs to automate things. Some of these APIs are not extensive, with some functionality available only through the GUI version of these products, so I fill in the gaps with Selenium.
I prefer the Tasker plugin called join. It integrates in with Tasker so you can use it in various ways. I used python in my computer to send notifications to Tasker via join. I actually went all out and made a personal assistant bot that way. I could control my computer from my phone with voice commands. I could ask it questions, etc. To receive text in python on my computer from my phone, I used a udp plugin for Tasker on my phone to send data to my computer. I made a udp server in python to receive the text.

Management was doing a lot of brutal Excel hell by taking raw tables, values from PDFs and Excel sheets and manually formatting values and copy/pasting the formatted tables into a master Excel sheet to spit out the reporting they wanted. I automated it to automatically pull the input reports from outlook, format it how they wanted and spit it back out in an email to them. Saved them about an hour a day.
Thank you, looking forward to your email! Feedback from real life users is always super valuable. I will check out kedro in the meantime. Yes, it would be great to have other contributors. If you know anyone i am happy to have a chat with them.
1. Yep. Good. In general, a principal of numerical analysis (the discipline in computing devoted to designing algorithms for simulations like this) is that you call make different errors cancel out. There's something deeper going on here, though. Newton's law of gravity is what's called a "conservative" force. But the method you're using to update your bodies doesn't preserve this property when you move to the discrete world of a computer. A numerical method that does preserve this property will still have errors, but the Earth won't drift like that. Try this: update the velocities by half a second. Then use those "half-step" velocities to update the positions by a full second. That's called the "leapfrog" method. It's the simplest symplectic integrator and it should improve things. You also need to make sure forces are applied symmetrically. I.e., Newton's third law: "for each action there is an equal and opposite reaction." The equations you're solving do this. But again when translated into the language of a computer, that can fail. In your loop through bodies where you apply acceleration have the pairs apply the force to each other so it's exactly equal and opposite. 2. Right. One thing is that a bigger time step means bigger errors. But another thing is that there's a "stability" criterion. If you make the time step too big, the errors from a single time step will push the Earth-moon system into totally different dynamics. Usually this will make your simulation go catastrophically wrong. This is typically called a "Courant-Friedrichs-Levy" or "CFL" criterion. If you're interested, give it a try. Make your time step huge and see what happens. 3. Close! It scales quadratically. In the computer science big O notation: O(N^2) where N is the number of bodies. You can see that in your code: you two nested loops over bodies. &gt;Random thought: This might be really obvious but shouldn't there be a way to instead of taking steps along the linear approximation of the object's movement (velocity) you could also account for the derivative of the velocity and therefore take better steps? (Increase the grade of the polynomial that approximates reality) Yes you can! There are many ways to do this! The generic term for this is "high order methods" or "high-order integrators." The method you're using now is "first-order." The leapfrog I suggested above is second-order. A phrase to look up: "Runge-Kutta methods"
Then why didn’t you post this using u/RedditForDesktop?
Wow, that's perfect Can you tell us what platform or libraries you are using here?
You understand that if there is a way to do these things without getting caught that someone will use them nefariously, right? As a result, all of these major media sites employ small armies of the smartest engineers money can buy to prevent this. They have done everything possible to detect and block anyone violating the TOS. In the face of that, how do you expect to succeed? You follow the TOS or eventually you will be detected and banned. There is no way to fool them, other than to be unmistakable from human activity.

So, are you planning to do this project just for fun and learning or you want to do something serious? Well, as other users have said, python will give you performance problems. But, to a fun side project it's ok to use Python. Otherwise, I probably would go with C++ or Rust.
I installed iris but didnt give it a chance. thanks guys!!
You need to understand the behavior of the index method. It returns the first match found. If you want to find all of the objects equal to some object and their index, you need to enumerate through the list and check for equality.
how would one do that? Sorry I'm a beginner
Good stuff actually
for index, item in enumerate (lists): if item == some_other_item: print("Index: f{index} , Item: f{item}")

Somewhat yes, thanks, been reading up the documentation, BTW since you have API endpoint deployment would it be possible to say deploy a Tensorflow serving (ie; Tensorflow model) over it?
Each list in your lists of lists is an object in the collection. Each will have their own unique index in the collection -- i.e. 0, 1, 2 &amp;#x200B; Whether or not one list affects the contents of another depends on whether or not they're referring to the same object. By creating the list this way: l = \[\[1,2\], \[1,2\]\], each of the nested lists will have a separate location in memory. &amp;#x200B; If you did this: l = \[\] nl = \[1,2\] l.append(nl) l.append(nl) &amp;#x200B; Then you would have a list with two nested lists that refer to the same object. If you change the contents of nl at this point, both references stored in l would reflect that.

Converting either of those to Python 3 would be good learning, no ? Although the code may not actually look too different.
Sudoku is actually a pretty complicated problem to solve in any language-it either involves backtracking or constraint programming, both of which are relatively complicated for beginners. Either way, I found several examples of code you would want to read by googling `python 3 sodoku`.

Great work, thanks for sharing. I was expecting more from your load_doggy() function.....
Yeah the evil laugh was for putting *kwargs instead of *args. And the function does grab 5% of the sum (for no reason in particular). And then i inputed a bunch of random numbers: 314 which is the first 3 digits of pi without a decimal, 69 is the sex number, 420 is the weed number (and interestingly enough, Hitler's birthday), 666 is the devil's number, and 1 is just a number. The main point of the post was the *kwargs tho.
1. /r/learnpython 2. You'll need to provide actual code. Please use the code formatting in your comment to keep things organized.
That is one cringe-worthy list of stuff...even for 2008.
OP if you don’t mind I have a few questions? How long have you been using python? Is your work with python an offshoot of your job or just something you do for fun? How long did this take to complete? Was this easier to complete after your awesome sodoku solver? Can’t wait to see your next project?
You should investigate first if this isn’t against the sites terms of use.
Ah - I thought it was a more specific graph indeed. This one is different than what I had in mind.
Maybe you can use \`inotify\` to monitor a given project path for certain file extensions and store the modifications.
Yeah, I thought of that. But then, installing a VSCode extension or an emacs extension would be much easier and require less maintenance. The inotify script wouldn't be much better than thyme IMO, though it would be less resource intensive.
Asyncio can help you a lot with this.... Quick n dirty example I made but covering some of you requirements already https://github.com/eLvErDe/asyncio_process_watcher
I now understand , \*interpreter\* not \*compiler. What i actually mean is that I need an interpreter(i stilll don't got it :|) like in Turbo C++ where you would write code and execute at the same place after writing a bulk of code.
I've had luck w/ colleagues within firms I've worked in (avoiding any non-competes, of course).
yes. I'm not too familiar with TF but nearly all python web frameworks are served by either WSGI or ASGI standards so if one WSGI framework (Flask, Django) can serve in front of something like TF, so can another. In theory. So if you are doing that with another Python framework, Masonite can do it as well.
I forget what to say at scrum standups, so I just wrote a script that analyzes git commits and jira changes (using JQL) to generate a report.

And of course 42 which is the answer of everything! :D But good to know I got the gist of it
Yep. Definitley not gonna do that in actual code tho, well maybe if i want to throw someone off. I could even try to reassign data types like this: int = str Then i could use floating points in place of integers. I might do something like that in the future.
Download fon the python website. Is easyer. And if i cam sugesta an ide, i would recommend spyder.

great job man ,,, and its really amazing. if u can help me and recommend where to start in image processing and what frameworks are the best for developing it. thank u in advance
the solution is related to docker, not python or pycharm
When I saw the title I thought it was going to be about a new dialect of Python for kernel-level programming lol
Personally I'd override `__getattr__` and `__setattr__` such that everything that is coming from or going to the DB is stored in a dict. This way there's no need to convert the object to a dict or turn a dict into an object. I'm not totally sure what you're asking regarding testing. I'd think you'd have a test DB that is used for testing...
For that to work you must build the docker image once. Thats probably not possible without internet access because it needs to install all the dependencies and most importantly pull the base image. After the image is build, docker should be able to run a container from the image without internet access. Allthough: If the machine is offline anyway, I dont see a reason why you would need docker to handle your dependencies, just install them manually and if you later need to pack your software as an image, do it on a machine with internet access.
Kite employee here: Thanks for giving Kite a try! The datasets that power Kite are quite large and we understand how memory usage can be a concern, especially for developers. We're actively working on optimizing our memory usage, both when Kite is idle and when you're actively coding. Hope you can give Kite another shot as we continue to improve it.
but i'm working on pycharm. this is not about the docker engine
packt is thrash, they always have insane deals because their books are low quality.
the *I* in IDE stands for 'integrated'. pycharm is an interface over many underlying tools, in this case docker. until you have a working container on your machine, docker tries to build images from remote sources by default. if you want to do something different, you need to use docker differently which means, it's a docker issue, not pycharm and not python

I prefer using the Windows store to keep Python updated. The only reason I posted here was to know if there are any significant issues using the Windows Store version.. which it looks like there aren't any. I also prefer Sublime Text 3 all my scripting needs. If I needed a full blown IDE, I prefer to use Visual Studio.
that's the issue. I have a working, running container on my machine and yet pycharm tries to access docker hub. I'm trying to change this default behavior (if possible).
I understand that but I suppose I wasn't clear about it in the first place but I was referring to the ease of deployment of API endpoints, although I read up on it and it seems straight forward enough to try, thanks for the reply

Great thanks. Still working through my Python book.
Here is my version : [https://manatlan.alwaysdata.net/sudoku.txt](https://manatlan.alwaysdata.net/sudoku.txt) it's py2 or py3 ... It's a naive approach. It will test all matches ...
Its behind a paywall.. Apparently i've already used my free preview of the month? I've never even visited this URL
I am confused. All this talk about "we need a stripped down version of Python", and yet they haven't just gone out and built one, released it, and sought user feedback and data? Seems like that would be far easier than trying to alter the momentum of python proper.
Did you execute the steps described here: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/using-docker-as-a-remote-interpreter.html ? Especially the following part: "To operate with Docker you need the busybox image be available on your machine. Ensure that you have a stable Internet connection, so that PyCharm can download and run busybox:latest. Once you have successfully configured Docker, you can go offline." What are your docker settings in pycharm? Did you configure the local registry in pycharm?
Ummm, k then.
This is exactly what I was looking for!
I don't think that feedback would tell us much. Of course most projects wouldn't work when their implied dependencies were removed, and of course those projects would work fine when those dependencies were installed though pip. The real question is on a technical one, but a social one. What happens when the maintenance rhythms of various core packages diverge, what happens when maintenance gets spread out over multiple teams. How effectively can we tackle bugs that spa multiple packages. How will we distinguish between official pypi packages and contribured ones, if at all? How do we prevent pypi from becoming like NPM? How will educational resources function when installing python is no longer a single step? Just a few people toying around with a stripped python will not answer any of these questions, unfortunately. That said, I definitely feel that the author makes a compelling case. The standard library is bloated, dated and inconsistent. Offloading that would require significant changes to how packages are managed, but I believe it would be worth it.
&gt; Seems like that would be far easier than trying to alter the momentum of python proper. Same group that gave us the whinefest that made Guido walk out.
This is super interesting but how do we get anyone to agree on this point \&gt; We need a “kernel” version of Python that contains only the most absolutely minimal library, so that all implementations can agree on a core baseline that gives you a “python” &amp;#x200B; We still can't agree on how packaging best practices should work.
I agree that this is the best way to get started.
See https://micropython.org, a real, working environment for embedded use. No need to start from scratch.
What about memory values? Is any of that something you can peek at?
Before getting all wrapped up in Jupyter notebooks, I advise you take a moment to get your bearings and learn how to use the Python REPL (`python` from the command line) and how to write and run a program (like "Hello World") without any fancy tools. Note the ways you can work with Python that you cannot do in C++ and you'll understand the core of interpreted vs. compiled language divide. If Python is installed on your machine, you probably already have a Turbo C++-like thing (based on my understanding of Turbo C++, which I just looked up now) called IDLE. Worry about Jupyter notebooks once you have a basic understanding of how Python works, especially if your head is filled with C++ ideas.
Craft commands reminds me of rails commands to generate boilerplate , something that I personally liked

Fantastic work, especially the detailed documentation. Thanks very much for sharing it. I hope other utility package developers use this as a template for their work.

There are some caveats when using the windows store version [https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#the-microsoft-store-package](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#the-microsoft-store-package) If there's no real reason not to, I think you're better of by installing the official windows 64 bit version from [python.org](https://python.org) instead
I like it a lot! :)
Do you mind talking a little about how you created https://github.com/Merwanedr/Popbot/blob/master/server/mrcnn/model.py ?
Thanks! See if you can extend it some more.
I don't think it gets any simpler than flask for this, nor do you have any alternatives that I can think of. You can whip together a flask app with user level permissions in 20 minutes, the only real alternatives are Django (tons of unused boilerplate) or bottle (not enough boilerplate) You don't need a dedicated message broker for this, you can probably get by just using a Queue, zeroMQ, or worst case memcached. You can use socketIO to push any state changes to the front end of all connected clients. What is your background process? Can you modify it's code? Are you looking to start/stop it or just pause/resume it?

I prefer to have the Windows Store keep Python updated; especially since Python is pretty low priority for me at this time. I like using the Windows Store when it's an option for me since it's so convenient; and, get to see all my app updates in one place. If I run into any issues down the road, I can always switch to the older standalone Windows installer version of Python.
I'm curious, is the micropython interpreter support RTOS (on applicable hardware) or is it a bare metal only?
&gt; I didn’t think much about sys.stdout other than stripping the newline might be good. (not sure it matters doe) Ohhh okay, yeah that's fine, another option is `print('something', end='', flush=True)` with or without flush if that's an issue. &gt;Yea the 'gifs/%s.gif' way seemed a little clunky, is there any other reason to switch to the other method? Mostly the new way of formatting with f strings or `.format()` is preferred as %s is being deprecated (or already is, I forget). But as for paths and join... it depends. With your app I'm sure it doesn't matter, but sometimes you might want to sanitize filenames and such rather than just dump user input into the path. If you were making a webapp and a user requested an image through an url param like `?image=foo.png`, then a user might try `?image=../../../../../etc/passwd`, and if formatted in raw, it would go back directories and fetch a file it might not be supposed to. Usually you want to be careful with formatting paths with user input into strings, but this is a simulation and no big deal. Just as a habit, consider what's the worst that can go in there. &gt;​Using argparse seems like a much better way of doing it now that I think about it (like you said) and I think I will add it in the future. I have never even used command line arguments in Python so think its time to learn it. Yeah, argparse is great, in standard library too. Another option some people prefer is the click library, which is not in the stdlib though. &gt;Yea I know, I had some other thoughts for the project at first (like adding bodies in the middle of a simulation) and some things like add_body are still in there. I'm also a bit confused about whether it's better to pass the data into the constructor or add it afterward. I'm also not sure why I would not just use SpaceImage.bodies.append(obj) instead of the SpaceImage.add_body(obj) . I'm kinda confused about these things. ​So, there actually can be a good reason for making it a function and not just appending directly... if in the future you want to do more than just add to the list, maybe log something or do some other calculation when bodies are added, it'd be easy to just modify a function rather than go through every `bodies.append(...)` and make it a function or add other logic. It helps with maintenance, but it really depends, that may never be an issue. It's more about reducing repetition and making it easier to maintain. But honestly I don't see a call to `.add_body` at all so I think it's just dead code, which IMO I'd just delete it and go back to it in the future if it ever comes up. &gt;Again, huge thanks for the response! No problem! Again, overall your code is great, just a few nitpicks since it sounded like you wanted feedback.

Let's try and be as fair as we can. A lot of the information in that conversation was carried by tone, which we lost through the transcript. I will also raise the argument that Guido has much thinner skin nowadays (compared to his prime) and that he has given many indications that he is a fan of a particular ideology that values offense-taking and performative histrionics.
\&gt; those projects would work fine when those dependencies were subsequently installed The feedback would be in relation to the effort involved in getting the projects "working fine". If it turns out to be trivial for all users, then one argument in favour of the status quo is addressed. \&gt; How will educational resources function when installing python is no longer a single step? Why wouldn't it be a single step? Why would an 'Educational Distribution' be created by people who care about education? It might seem like additional work, but it's really just work that is currently hidden in the core maintenance activity. \&gt; I believe it would be worth it. I don't. This would be a 4.0 style change, and I reckon 2.X needs to be dead and buried for a generation or more before that step is taken again.

&gt; That is, working 40 hours a week on Python coding, will I gain knowledge quickly? ...maybe? I don't know you. Python is probably easier to learn than many other languages, being relatively high-level and dynamically typed. But some people really struggle with programming. Do you have a background in anything related, like formal logic, math, or physics? (Even these may or may not help, depending on your experience and the type of programming you'll be doing.) I don't think you'll really know until you try it.
Yes, although it is platform dependent. I think the esp32 port is free-rtos based (ESP-IDF)
This post kind of glosses over the fact that a lot of Python's user-base exists precisely \_because\_ it's batteries included for 80% of general purpose programming tasks. I'm not as convinced as other people that the language will stand on the merits of it's design alone. Python is popular simply because it has the least amount of overhead to get anything done as a proof of concept, a first pass, a one-off or anything that needs to be done but not necessarily extensively parallel or low-latency or performant in general. &amp;#x200B; I agree with the concept of a stricter "Kernel" style API where the current standard library is chopped up into "really necessary" and "most sane people will have this", but I'm very wary of this devolving into a nodejs/Latex style clusterfudge or 10s of thousands of packages to get anything of note done really. &amp;#x200B; Maybe what really makes a lot more sense is to decouple python standard library development from python core development ala Linux Kernel API and glibc, but have them still ship/distribute it together if review latency and stricter interfaces are the concern?
Those are fair points. That said, in the article/incident I'm talking about, I saw Amber Brown [didn't seem to think it was out of context](https://twitter.com/hawkieowl/status/1129809234303049728). She didn't like that it overshadowed other things, but she didn't seem to disagree with how the talk was captured. I'm just getting the impression that the twisted crew wants to fork or freeze the python project, but lacks the resources to do so. So they do this stuff.
These twisted people seem to be hellbent on preserving Python 2 and destroying the rest of Python, starting with the standard library.
It's like the Python 2 forever people who kept trying to convince the core devs to abandon Python 3 yet couldn't be bothered doing any work on a Python 2.8 themselves.
I was calling for a coup before Guido stepped down, but even I think that "he is a fan of a particular ideology that values offense-taking and performative histrionics" is nasty, inaccurate and unhelpful. Guido's nice and cares about people; I don't know when that became an ideology.
I imagined Python was being embedded in the Linux kernel somehow, for some reason.
Hard to say how fast you'll pick it up because that depends on your background and how quickly you learn. You are in an ideal spot to learn it quickly though. It is especially helpful having experienced python developers willing to help you learn. Also, having good example code to work through will also be very helpful. I took a job that utilizes Python extensively (drivers, data pipelines, and statistical analysis) and picked it up very quickly due to experienced senior level engineers willing to help and tons of well written code to work through. I do have an EE degree and coding experience so the learning curve wasn't very steep for me. It really all depends heavily on your background and what exactly you'll be doing.

Not sure I agree on the batteries included being the attraction. You could take out a good chunk, and pip makes it easy to install what you need. I'd point more that nearly anyone can be taught print("hello world"), but then you have advanced stuff like data science, mapping, etc, that are still the same language. That is, the language's abilities scale up as your experience/acumen scales. The glyph author wants a lighter python so libs are more nimble on pypi. Great. So fork the module, put it up, and extend as you see fit. It doesn't make the python runtime slower to not load the colorsys module. It doesn't stop the end result the author wants, a more nimble colorsys module. It's just lots of words with no real upside or point. I'm really starting to think this twisted crowd is pissy that asyncio is stepping on their toes. Their cheese has moved, and they want it back.

Sorry! I made a big mistake when updating the code and it was replying to every comment on reddit. So so so sorry. OrionSuperman
&gt; Today, however, the modules you need to convert colors between coordinate systems are only a pip install away. The point of batteries included is that you don't have to make a (potentially terrible, especially if you're new) choice. If `pip install colorsys` could get you the modules you need from a source you trust as much as the place you got your python, for security but also for correctness, quality and documentation, then this would be true. But if you have a "standard pip" repo then you may as well just bundle it with python because it's not that big. Hence the stdlib.
LOL
Yeah... I’m scared to count how many replies it actually managed to do in 20 minutes unfettered.
What are you going to be doing? Infrastructure development, analytics, web development, etc. Python is a great language to start with, but you can feel like you know Python pretty well then move to another role that is completely different. For example, someone that is very experienced in Django can definitely write good code, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they would succeed using Python for machine learning like someone with a math background.
these proposals seem realistically like nonstarters to me, as they'll break all existing distributions' notion of dependencies my layperson high level hand wavy figuring of a rough minimal series of events would be something line some are published to pypi as placeholders python itself probably needs an api for indicating which modules are stdlib for that version `pip` is special cased to handle special cases specially. and starts emitting these packages in I.e. freeze and list and whatnot have install requests for them indicate somewhere that they were "installed" rather that default included eventually start emitting warnings when they're used but not "installed" externally. eventually stop including them and remove the special case.
&gt; Not sure I agree on the batteries included being the attraction. You could take out a good chunk, and pip makes it easy to install what you need. I'd point more that nearly anyone can be taught print("hello world"), but then you have advanced stuff like data science, mapping, etc, that are still the same language. That is, the language's abilities scale up as your experience/acumen scales. This is precisely my point, Python - of all popular general purpose programming languages out there has the gentlest curve from `print("Hello World")` to a decently useful piece of code that provides tangible value. The moment you say "just pip install it" - you get into dependency management, setting up virtual environments and shipping your code as pip/conda/wheel packages instead of simple scripts that you can drop onto a box and run with `python myscript.py`. I feel a lot of Python developers who use Python day-to-day have forgotten that a significant portion of Python's userbase is actually people who are _not_ Python Developers and are barely even programmers. Going from having it working on your machine to having a functioning pip/wheel that you are able to host/distribute and install ono your servers/machines/vm instance is a non-trivial amount of work for anyone that's not in a "just stick it in a container" mindset. Pulling out "batteries included" takes away the ability to drop a file anywhere and just run (unless you use something like pyinstaller to get you there). Additionally I feel without structure around what this new piece of python, left behind after the "python kernel" has been ripped out, will only exacerbate the problem glyph mentioned in his post: &gt; "determining which modules have been removed from the standard library is a sticking point. They have to be discovered by a process of trial and error; notably, a process completely different from the standard process for determining dependencies within a Python application." --- &gt; The glyph author wants a lighter python so libs are more nimble on pypi. Great. So fork the module, put it up, and extend as you see fit. This is not what he's saying at all in his post - he's saying two things as far as I can tell: 1. The UX for contributors is pretty bad because the maintainers are over burdened - decoupling the standard library (or libraries) into it's own project (or projects) reduces the load on core maintainers and lets each one do their individual job better. 2. The large and bloated standard library that is strongly coupled with the CPython run-time means that developing new sane runtimes that are compatible with "standard" Python (implying CPython) are hard to write because there is no strict spec to write to. The more nimble libraries are almost a side-effect and not the intended change at all here. &gt; It doesn't make the python runtime slower to not load the colorsys module. It doesn't stop the end result the author wants, a more nimble colorsys module. It's just lots of words with no real upside or point. I think you're misinterpreting the underlying point being made in the post - it's saying that other _implementations_ such as micropython or brython are burdened with carrying around (read implementing and ensuring compatibility) obscure stdlib modules because the standard "CPython" does or they must make a decision to be specifically incompatible in undefined ways - which poses a barrier to adoption. Some of these alternate run-times can't even afford to be as big as CPython even if they _did_ want to implement all of the stdlib's modules - Micropython is meant to run on a microcontroller - you can't really even install a 100MB interpreter on some of these things, much less load the modules you need. It's the same for Brython - it implements Python on-top Javascript - to run it you must effectively download a javascript file that implements the entire Python stack before you can actually run any python code against it. This means a browser tab has a overhead when it uses Brython to implement functionality instead of native javascript. For example Brython implementation itself is ~550KB, for comparison - the sum of all of the JS required by the Github page _for_ Brython is under 200KB. This makes Brython an expensiveish tradeoff for most things, especially mobile use-cases where your app/page won't load until you have all your assets. There are caching and other optimizations, but you see my point about other implementations having to pay the cost for CPython's decisions. --- &gt; I'm really starting to think this twisted crowd is pissy that asyncio is stepping on their toes. Their cheese has moved, and they want it back. One, I'd like to point out this is an ad homeniem. Two, nothing in post really seemed to indicate that this comes from a place of twisted losing out to asyncio. My personal opinion (which may be wrong) is that the more useful networking stuff twisted does, only twisted can still do. --- In general I see the point Glyph is trying to make, the problem he highlights makes a lot of sense. I just don't think the proposed solution is the right fix given all the other factors though.
I learned this one today, use Nametoenter = input('Enter your name here: ') Print ('Well hello there', Nametoenter)
I wrote a simple Sudoku solver in Python a while back, so maybe I can help. But can you be a little more specific about what you want to learn? Do you have any particular approach in mind? If not, can you describe your personal "manual" Sudoku-solving strategy?
How did you make it so fast? Rendering a single frame for me takes at least a minute at low resolutions. even with C I was getting a few seconds per low res frame

post the source? this is pretty cool !
The irony is excellent.
Pretty sure you problem is on line 54. &amp;#x200B; so you got: print(str("you guessed it right...hurray") + int(count + "times")) &amp;#x200B; specifically the int(count + "times") is probably giving you the error, you are trying to convert count+"times" into an int, but the result is actually a string, it can't convert "times" into a number. &amp;#x200B; try this instead: print("you guessed it right...hurray! You guessed it in ", str(count), " guesses") or something similar. Just move that string out of the int() cast and the problem should go away.

I would read a tutorial like that, with the great pleasure.
Nice!
[https://pastebin.com/ie1KWLt7](https://pastebin.com/ie1KWLt7) &amp;#x200B; I'm having issues with small numbers. I'm using numpy's 128 bit complex numbers, but when we zoom in too far the numbers get so close to each other that it pixelates the image.
Vectorize it and throw it onto your gpu! [https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/user/vectorize.html](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/user/vectorize.html) You can set the target='cuda'
Does anybody know of any fast solutions for the floating point number precision? I'm using numpy's 128 bit complex numbers, but it pixelates way too early. I've seen other videos where they can get the zoom to a magnitude of 200 or even 300. How?
Woooooah, I can taste time now.
Why wouldn't it be?
I mean you can but that would be web scraper hell. Take a look at youtube_dl. Linux package and python module for downloading YouTube videos. Can convert to mp3
That was presented as the opposing perspective of someone, equally as uncharitable, siding with the "whiners". To your point though; the ideology I was hinting at is supposedly full of nice people who just care about "others". But it has been pathologized into taking emphatic, exaggerated, vitriolic offence on behalf of "others".
Yes
I think u/TylerPoff hit it right on the money. Although, while I'm here, I'll offer some constructive criticism. On line 55, I would change that 'elif' to an 'else'. Imo, it makes that structure and flow of your code more apparent. Not a big deal with short branching logic like we have here, but when you have more complex branches, it's easier to maintain an easily comprehendable structure, so as to allow another dev (or you, a couple months down the road) to reason about your branching logic without having to understand the logic inside each branch.
&gt; I'm just getting the impression that the twisted crew wants to fork or freeze the python project, but lacks the resources to do so. So they do this stuff. That's how it looks to me too. They can't afford to do what they want, so are left with little resort than to voice their displeasure. I consider theirs to be a valid position to hold (though I disagree with it) and I recognise the Twisted people as a legitimate constituency of Python that shouldn't be marginalised for holding their different position. &gt; I don't think Guido is thin skinned, I think he's had his share of arrows in his back. I presented that argument as a mirror to your own. I also don't think Guido is "thin-skinned", but I do think the years of conflict and negativity has taken it's toll on both his charity and patience. Having retreated from his dominant position in the organisation (if not the community), he now has the liberty to act out as he sees fit. The BDFL walking out of the same talk 3 years ago would have meant a lot more than it did a few months ago.
Sshhh, stop being silly. The adults are talking.
I suppose it's theoretically possible to write a proper, full-blown compiler for Python that produces machine-code executables. From there, we could write Python modules for manual memory management and inline Assembly; at that point, it really would be possible to write a kernel in Python. Wouldn't it?

&gt; I recognise the Twisted people as a legitimate constituency of Python that shouldn't be marginalised for holding their different position. I don't think anyone is saying they don't have a place. I think people are tired of what appears to be complaining for the sake of complaining. &gt; Having retreated from his dominant position in the organisation I think you severely underestimate the swing he has both by his name, and by being 20% of the steering council. I'd guess that if he said "X is a great idea", that'd have some sway on its own with the other 4 members.
Sorry for the trouble ... I edited it, to make it more readable, without testing... So may be I have introduce bugs. .. I will correct it soon, in 2 hours
I honestly do not have much more insight because i am only in the ambiguous planning phase right now. Although, what do you mean by access to the data?
I think there would be interest. You may also want to look at ModernGL: https://github.com/moderngl/moderngl
not using mongodb has been a very successful strategy for me, otherwise there are some ORM-like layers on top of pymongo: [https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/tools.html#orm-like-layers](https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/tools.html#orm-like-layers)
&gt; This is not what he's saying at all in his post - he's saying two things as far as I can tell: Those two things are stating that there's a burden to libraries with cobwebs. The colorsys module highlighted has no PRs against it. If Glyph wanted to really make his point, he'd file a PR on it and pipe up in six months saying "wtf guise?" &gt;such as micropython or brython are burdened with carrying around (read implementing and ensuring compatibility) obscure stdlib modules because the standard "CPython" does or they must make a decision to be specifically incompatible in undefined ways - which poses a barrier to adoption. I don't know much about Brython, but micropython is based on 3.4, and there's a lot missing from the stdlib. I don't think it'll ever encapsulate the entire stdlib, nor would anyone really want it to. Turtle for instance, no need there. &gt;One, I'd like to point out this is an ad homeniem. Two, nothing in post really seemed to indicate that this comes from a place of twisted losing out to asyncio. My personal opinion (which may be wrong) is that the more useful networking stuff twisted does, only twisted can still do. It'd be ad hominem if I said "f the argument, these people are dumb". I'm saying they just complain, Amber Brown for the admitted sake of complaining, Glyph for reasons I'm not entirely sure. I mean, I know they're two different people, but they need a PR person to get them on the same page. On one hand, bugs in stdlib are bad, but we need to keep them. On the other, let's yank out all this stuff we're either not using or isn't developing quickly enough. I get they're two different people, but for working on the same project, you'd think they'd have similar desires for Python as a whole. I can see the desire for what Glyph is talking about. I just don't think it's really required. Back in the day, a robust stdlib was good, as internet access wasn't guaranteed. Now, the minor bit of disk space isn't much to worry about on modern systems, and there's no performance loss if you're not loading the libs.
I'd definitely be interested in tutorials on PyOpenGL. I've looked at it before but it was a bit daunting with the resources currently out there.
Hi please visit /r/redditfordesktop or contact u/redditfordesktop. But to answer ur question in a nutshell, this is not simply just a browser. It also has many additional modules such as native notification etc, which chrome doesn't have. In fact, custom modules is the main part of the program.
You could maybe use the YouTube Data API v3 to do this. I'd read up on their documentation.

If it makes a difference (and I would be happy to send further code examples if necessary), but I want column B to be a parameter that I work into a function.
Not sure about this particular case, but I was looking into fractals many years ago and at that time most programs used only integer arithmetic (storing the exponent in another integer). Eg: 0.5 would be stored as (5, -1). Maybe that would help?
A good start might be to download some data of past seasons games and use the numbers to determine the probability of scoring a certain amount of points in any given game. There’s so much that goes into determining an actual basketball game that you’ll go crazy trying to measure intangibles, start small!
Read the dataframe doc.
I have. I’m thinking that maybe my function might be throwing something off, which is why I added my comment. I’ll see if I can I can recreate the situation in a blank do and go from there. Thanks.
Yeah I know medium gives you up to 3 reads per month. Though content is interesting, I do not see a reason to pay for it. This specific article however gave me new insights about pandas that I thought worth sharing. Thanks!
Isn't OpenGl deprecated in favor of Vulkan?
moderngl is a great idea. Unfortunately, moderngl is poorly designed.
A lot of opengl rendering is done on the card, so Python's speed only matters as far as actually producing the vertex buffers, etc. that you're going to push to the card.
This would be easier to diagnose if you formatted the code for reddit and included the error message from the terminal. Also you'll probably get better answers [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/).
Out of curiosity, what would you say are some flaws? I have not used it myself, but it seems very actively developed.

lists is not a global variable. It does't 'live' outside the method. Try the last method/code with: print(s()) This way the return lists will get printed. a = s(); print(a); # Try this too Keep on learning!
